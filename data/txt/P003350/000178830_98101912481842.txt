CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS
Since May 2, 1977, the Burmese Kyat has been officially valued
at 8.51 to the IMF Special Drawing Right (SDR) and consequently its
value floats relative to other currencies. The following exchange
rate is used throughout this report:
US$1.00 = Kyat (K) 6.7
K 1.00   =  US$0.15

BURMA
NYAUNGGYAT DAM MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
Staff Appraisal Report
I. Sectoral Background
General Economy
1.01      Burma is potentially one of the richest countries in South Asia.
Apart from impressive natural resources, it is endowed with a healthy and
highly literate population and a relatively low population density (120/sq mi).
It is an agriculture-based country with 77% of its 32 M inhabitants living
in rural areas and dependent directly or indirectly on agriculture. Burma's
260,000 sq mi are made up of four climatic and topographical regions: the
Western and Northern Hills, Shan Plateau, Central Region, and Arakan and
Tenasserim Coastal Regions. About 27% of the land (45 M ac) is considered
arable, but only about 20 M ac are currently cultivated since rainfall and
access to water supplies are limited in the remaining cultivable areas.
Forests containing several species of valuable timber, particularly teak,
cover almost half of Burma, while swamps, rivers, lakes, settlements, and
grazing land comprise about one quarter of the country.
1.02      Despite its considerable natural resource base, favorable man-land
ratio, and high degree of literacy, Burma's economic record historically has
been disappointing. With per capita GDP of about US$150 p.a., it ranks among
the 25 least developed nations. The guiding philosophy of the present Govern-
ment (GOB) is based on a combination of traditional Burmese values and socialist
doctrine that attempts to reorient the economy toward adequate physical neces-
sities and to improve social services. Although it has made some progress
towards social goals (land redistribution, education, health care), GOB's
ability to raise the material well-being of the population has. been constrained
by slow economic growth. The increase in value added by the directly productive
sectors during the 1960s and early 1970s scarcely matched population growth
(2.2% p.a.), while export volumes declined for most of the period. Low export
earnings in turn reduced the economy's capacity to import raw materials, spare
parts, and capital equipment, leading to further underutilization of capacity
in most sectors and severely limiting expansion.
1.03      The critical question, therefore, is the quality with which Burma
can manage and develop its human and natural resources. To improve economic
performance, GOB began over the 1971-78 1/ period to institute basic reforms
such as selective increases in agricultural procurement prices, currency
devaluation, increased interest rates on savings deposit, tax reform, reorga-
nization of the banking system, managerial and organizational reform of State
1/   Dates expressed are in terms of Burmese fiscal years, April 1-March 31.



- 2 -
Economic Enterprises, and import liberalization. As a result of these reforms
and generally favorable climatic conditions, growth accelerated under the
Second Four-Year Plan (SFYP) (1975-78). Gross domestic product (GDP) increased
by an annual average of 4.8% in real terms, compared with 2.7% during the
previous decade. Agricultural growth recovered after 1975 thereby bolstering
the export and manufacturing sectors. Gross capital formation practically
doubled over the four-year period, and domestic savings expanded. Exports
grew by 10.6% p.a. in current terms (1975-78) principally reflecting export
price increases and expanded rice exports.
1.04      Burma's recent economic performance provides a relatively firm
base to intensify development efforts under the Third Four-Year Plan (TFYP)
(1979-82). Ambitious targets have been set for overall GDP growth (6.6% p.a.)
and individual sectors, notably agriculture (5.8%), industry (12.2%), and
power (14.3%). In support of these targets, total investment would accelerate
to levels (11.2% p.a.) more than double rates achieved under SFYP, and public
sector investment would increase by over 150% of the level realized during
SFYP. While planned increases in investment and growth are desirable, these
must be complemented by major improvements in absorptive capacity and by
continued reforms begun during the 1970s.
The Agricultural Sector
A.   Role of Agriculture in the Economy
1.05      The agricultural sector, including livestock, forestry, and fisheries,
accounted for 36% of 1978 GDP in current prices and employed 68% of the labor
force. Agricultural products, primarily rice and teak, represent about 85% of
all exports. More than 60% of Burma's industrial output stems from the process-
ing of agricultural crops including paddy, cotton, jute, and sugarcane. Paddy
is by far the most important crop, accounting for about 42% of the value added
for agricultural crops and more than half of the sown area. Other major crops
in terms of sown area include sesame, pulses, groundnut, maize, cotton, sugar-
cane, wheat, chillies, jute, tobacco, onions, coconut, and rubber. The agri-
cultural sector performed poorly over the decade prior to 1976; its average
annual growth rate (1.6%) was less than both the 2.3% growth in GDP and 2.2%
in population. During that decade, exports in constant prices decreased by
about two-thirds largely due to declining rice exports. The poor performance
of the agricultural sector was a major cause of Burma's slow economic growth
during this period. Its origins can be traced to insufficient public and
private investment in agriculture, inadequate production incentives, and
shortages of inputs and agricultural support services.
1.06      There has been considerable improvement in the sector's performance
since 1976 with an annual growth rate averaging about 3.8% (1975-78), reflecting
more favorable weather conditions, higher world timber prices, and GOB action
to redress past problems. In re-ordering its investment priorities to give
more emphasis to agriculture and other primary producing sectors, GOB has
increased agriculture's share of State capital expenditure from 11% for the
1964--74 period to about 20% during SFYP and to a targeted 27% for TFYP.  Over



- 3 -
the past few years, GOB has also raised procurement prices for several impor-
tant crops, notably jute, cotton, and sugarcane, and has attempted to improve
input availability and agricultural support services.
B.   Principal Project Area Crops
1.07      Paddy.  Paddy, Burma's main crop, accounts for about 55% of the
total sown area and is the country's main export commodity. Production has
grown slowly during the last decade, increasing by only 2.0% p.a. Once the
largest rice exporter in the world, Burma suffered considerable damage to
embankment structures during World War II and subsequently from recurrent
social disturbances and inadequate embankment maintenance. Over the last
15 years, there has been no significant increase in sown area nationwide as
increases in acreage in Upper Burma have merely compensated for losses in
delta areas of Lower Burma. Adoption of high-yielding varieties (HYVs) has
been constrained in the past by the lack of material inputs (especially seeds
and fertilizers), unavailability of locally adapted varieties, inadequate
water control, and draft power shortages during peak demand periods. As a
consequence, yields stagnated up to 1976, and paddy production fluctuated
around pre-war levels of 8 M tons. However, because of favorable weather
and increased input availability, paddy yields increased from 1,570 lbs/ac
in 1975 to an estimated 1,840 lbs/ac in 1979, and total production expanded
from 8.4 M to 10.3 M tons over the period, or by an average of 5.2% p.a.
Under TFYP, Burma hopes to boost paddy production to 11.0 M tons by 1982, or
by an average of 4.2% p.a., principally through greater adoption of HYV pack-
ages. While open market paddy prices currently offer growers considerable
incentive to increase paddy production, particularly in rice-deficit areas,
the GOB-regulated compulsory paddy procurement system and its prices, which
have been maintained low and essentially unchanged since 1974, dampen some
of this incentive. Sensitive to the inflationary and budgetary consequences
that might spring from modification of this important national system, GOB
has attempted to mitigate this constraint to growth by instituting over the
last several years a series of input supply incentives complemented by insti-
tutional and technical support--a program that includes substantial subsidies
on critical inputs (paras 8.07-8.12).
1.08      Cotton.  Faced with growing demand for cotton textiles and inade-
quate supply of raw materials to service its manufacturing capacity, Burma
has been forced to import increasing quantities of cotton yarns, lint, and
fabrics. Cotton cultivation was introduced into Burma in the late 1950s
to supply its newly installed cotton manufacturing industry.  To ensure a
reliable supply, cultivation within the irrigated areas of Upper Burma's dry
zone was advocated and bolstered by initially favorable compulsory procurement
prices. The cotton development program proved unsuccessful, however, basic-
ally because of unadjusted and increasingly non-competitive prices from 1961
to 1971, mandatory cropping in unsuitable areas and season, and unsatisfactory
varieties. As a result, sown area declined from 616,000 in 1965 to 362,000 ac
in 1970, and total seed cotton production dropped from 68,000 to 34,000 tons
over the five-year period. Sown area has fluctuated widely over the past
decade reaching a high of 552,000 ac in 1972 and low of 402,000 ac in 1977;
since then area sown to cotton increased to 461,000 ac in 1979. During most
of the last decade, seed cotton production stagnated around 40,000 tons, but



- 4 -
increased to 52,000 tons in 1979. Part of the problem historically has been
the wide divergence between sown and harvested areas particularly reflecting
the fact that about 90% of the cotton crop is grown under rainfed conditions.
Also, despite GOB attempts to reduce competition with other crops by mandating
use of irrigation water for cotton and by doubling procurement prices in
January 1974, farmers have neglected compulsory cotton plantings and concen-
trated efforts on more lucrative crop alternatives.
1.09      With a doubling of the cotton procurement price again in March-
December 1976, yields have reflected farmers' increased incentives: the
national average yield rose from 220 lbs of seed cotton per ac (1971-77)
to 290 lbs in 1978-79. Higher yields from new varieties, better extension
effort, more assured water supplies, and concentration of cotton on more
suitable soils and in a less risky season, as proposed in the project, should
further stimulate production. Reflecting these reorientations, TFYP estab-
lishes a rather ambitious 1982 target of 64,000 tons of medium-staple cotton
production, requiring an average annual growth of 14.7% over 1978 levels.
C.   Performance and Problems
1.10      To reinforce and accelerate recently achieved economic growth, pro-
gress must be made in rationalizing the role of agricultural and industrial
prices in the allocation of resources. At present, investment and production
decisions are guided by plan targets rather than changes in production and
market conditions. Apart from rigidity in controlled pricing systems, the
problems confronting agriculture include insufficient supplies of essential
farm inputs, inadequate transportation facilities, and shortages of farm power
and basic farm services, in particular agricultural credit and extension. If
Burma's agricultural performance is to be improved, intensive and coordinated
action will be necessary to deal with these requisites.
The Power Sector
A.   General
1.11      Electric power supply in Burma is governed by the Electricity Supply
Act of 1948. Under this act, GOB nationalized the electric energy supply
industry and formed the Electricity Supply Board. The Board was later reor-
ganized into the Electric Power Corporation (EPC) under the Ministry of
Industry. Since then the Ministry of Industry has been split into the Ministry
of Industries I and II. EPC is now one of seven statutory corporations under
the Ministry of Industry II (MI-2) that includes other corporations relating
to heavy industry and petroleum. EPC is mandated to supply the electric power
requirements of government institutions and the public; to be responsible for
the installation of new generating plants, transmission lines, substations, and
distribution systems; to formulate and implement schemes to develop the system;
and to conduct business in a manner similar to that of a commercial enterprise.
EPC basically has autonomy in its daily operations; however, responsibility
for decision-making in important matters such as system planning and invest-
ment rests with MI-2.
1.12      In 1978, average consumption per capita in Burma was estimated
at about 26 kWh and average generation per capita at about 34 kWh, including



- 5 -
that provided by captive generating plants owned by GOB departments and indus-
tries. The latter figure compares with 15 kWh in Nepal, 24 kWh in Bangladesh,
and 156 kWh in India.
1.13      At the end of 1978, about 469,000 consumers were connected to the
system, mostly in the major cities. About 7% of the population had access
to electricity. Currently, there is a waiting list of over 150,000 potential
consumers who cannot be served, mainly because of inadequate distribution
facilities.
B.   Energy Resources
1.14      Available energy resources in Burma include hydro potential, petro-
leum, and gas, of which the most abundant is hydro potential. Theoretical
hydro potential was estimated at 100 M kW and 370 billion kWh p.a. in a power
survey carried out under the UNDP/IDA Burma Umbrella Project (January 1977 to
June 1978). It appears that economically exploitable hydro resources in Burma
would be sufficient to meet power demand for the foreseeable future, although
considerable time will be needed to develop these resources. Various pre-
feasibility studies indicate that about 20 sites might be suitable for hydro-
electric exploitation, totalling more than 5 M kW and 20 billion kWh of annual
energy.
1.15      Present crude oil production in Burma is about 30,000 barrels per
day (about 10 M barrels p.a.). Detailed information on total oil reserves
is not available, but proven reserves are estimated at about 100 M barrels.
This suggests that it would not be prudent to rely on this scarce resource
for long-term power generation.
1.16      Natural gas fields are principally located along the Irrawaddy River
in Central Burma. Reserves have been variously estimated at 150 billion cu ft
(on a proven basis) 1/ to 462 billion cu ft 2/. While detailed information on
total gas reserves is not available, even with the latter estimate, reserves
would provide only about a 22-year supply for two existing fertilizer plants
(Sale and Kyunchaung), two existing gas turbine stations (103 MW), a committed
fertilizer plant (Pyalo), and two committed gas turbine stations (72 MW).
This limitation suggests that it would not be desirable to commit further gas
resources for power generation.
Government Development Policy and IDA Lending Strategy
1.17      With the issuance of TFYP, GOB reaffirmed its commitment to
(a) higher and sustained growth supported by increased investment, (b) con-
tinued priority for agricultural development as the principal mechanism for
generating and conserving foreign exchange, (c) increased labor productivity
and employment, and (d) greater, but judicious, utilization of the country's
natural resources to facilitate growth. IDA's lending strategy has supported
1/   From the Oil and Gas Journal, December 1978.
2/   From the Power Survey under UNDP/IBRD Umbrella Project (June 1978).



- 6 -
these GOB objectives by aiming to ease the most immediate constraints to growth
and, particularly, at increasing and diversifying production for export to
alleviate the shortage of foreign exchange. Within this overall strategy,
primary emphasis is being given to the development of agriculture, forestry,
and mining. Within this framework and where possible, priority is being given
to quick-yielding projects. At the same time, infrastructure-oriented projects
are proposed and are being financed in such areas as transportation, telecom-
munications, and power.
1.18      Since 1973 IDA has made 14 credits to Burma totalling US$272.3 M
(net of cancellations). About 58% of this assistance was channelled to the
agricultural sector, consisting of eight projects: irrigation, rubber,
livestock, seeds development, two paddyland development projects, and two
forestry projects. About 15% of IDA's assistance has supported the rehabili-
tation of the transport sector through three projects, namely inland water
transport, railways, and ports development. The remaining IDA assistance
has funded projects in telecommunications (21%) and mining (6%). Projects
in various stages of preparation involve the following sectors: forestry,
telecommunications, fisheries, and power. The proposed power project would
finance installation of transmission lines to integrate committed gas turbine
power stations.
1.19      In the past, lending was partly constrained by limited knowledge of
key sectors and the lack of adequately prepared projects. Ongoing projects
and sector work have improved the information base and a UNDP-financed, IDA-
executed Technical Assistance Project (US$4.1 M) has developed a project pipe-
line in critical sectors such as agriculture, transport, power, and industry.
Technical assistance packages financed through project lending have also
helped improve Burmese project preparation capabilities, as well as adminis-
trative and managerial skills, through in-service and overseas training.
1.20      The proposed Nyaunggyat project would mark the largest Burmese
project ever financed by IDA, and the proposed IDA credit would represent
the largest for Burma to date. While involving a relatively long implementa-
tion period, its objectives are in consonance with GOB's development goals,
including the development of hydro potential wherever feasible, and with IDA's
strategy of supporting sound growth-oriented investments. The project would
include agricultural supporting services and would complement ongoing or pro-
posed projects geared to alleviating technical and institutional constraints.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The project area is located in Kyaukse, Myittha, Wundwin, and Tada-U
Townships in Burma's central dry zone. The main highway from Rangoon to Mandalay
passes through this area, which is situated about 40 mi south of the city of
Mandalay. The project area extends 48 mi north to south and 20 mi from east
to west. It stretches from the foothills of the Shan Plateau almost to the
Irrawaddy River, 30 mi away to the west (Map IBRD 14543).



7-
Climate
2.02      The project area, has a tropical monsoon climate with three distinct
seasons: a rainy season from mid-May to mid-October, a dry cool season from
mid-October to mid-February, and a hot dry season from mid-February to mid-
May. The rainfall gradient is sharp, with much more rain at and near the dam
site than in the command area out on the plain. Average rainfall in the com-
mand area is only about 32 inches p.a., with one peak in May-June and another
in September-October. Temperature variation at Mandalay ranges during the year
from a January average of 70 F to a May average of 87 0F.  However, minimum
temperatures can fall below 500F, and maximum temperatures can rise above 104 0F.
Humidity varies with temperature and rainfall, and leads to considerable evapo-
transpiration in the hot dry months from March to May (Annex 1, Table 4).
Topography and Soils
2.03      About 80% of the currently irrigated area to be rehabilitated
through the project consists of heavy soils of fine texture, much of which
have imperfect drainage. The remaining soils in this area are of coarse tex-
ture and are largely light and moderately well-drained. In the new area to
be irrigated through the project, about 15% of the area contains heavy soils
of fine texture while the remaining soils are largely light and moderately
well-drained. The soils in both the currently irrigated area and the dryland
tract range from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline with pH ranging from
6.6 to 8.3.
2.04      Based on topography, soil texture, and drainage conditions, land
in the project area is broadly grouped into two categories: paddyland and ya
land. Generally, paddyland is in flat, low lying areas with heavy soils, and
ya land is on upland with well-drained medium or light soils. The project's
net command area comprises 85,400 ac of paddyland and 116,100 ac of ya land.
Most of the paddyland (80%) is in the currently irrigated area while most of
the ya land (83%) is unirrigated at present. Further land development statis-
tics are given in Annex 1, Table 1.
Water Resources and Drainage
2.05      The existing irrigation system depends for its water supply on the
unregulated natural run-off of the rivers. The catchment area of the Panlaung
River at the Kinda Weir site measures about 970 sq mi. Annual streamflow
(1950-77) averaged about 1,765 cusecs at Kinda Weir, which fluctuates depend-
ing on precipitation in the upper basin area. Minimum streamflow usually
occurs in March-April, sometimes reduced to less than 70 cusecs. The main
natural drains in the currently irrigated area are the Panlaung, Samon,
Htongyi, Dan Chaung, and Pauk Chaung Rivers. All drains have large cross-
sections, particularly in flatter areas, but have been partially eroded by
flows and provide relatively poor drainage. There are also some man-made
ditches providing only limited drainage. Additional drainage for the area
is considered essential.



-8-
Irrigation Facilities
2.06      The existing Panlaung irrigation system commands, by means of three
diversion weirs (Kinda, Nathwle, and Kyime) on the Panlaung River, a gross
area of 117,000 ac. The total net acreage nominally supported by irrigation
facilities is 94,000 ac, but due to land abandonment from flooding and drain-
age hazards, only about 88,000 ac are actually supported. Currently, only
partial irrigation can be provided for this area because of heavy silting in
existing canals.
2.07      Conveyance systems are designed for proportional distribution with-
in subsystems serving net areas of about 3,000 to 25,000 ac and have a duty of
one cusec per 50 ac to meet requirements of monsoon paddy. The feeder canal,
main canals, distributaries, and minors are all unlined. The sizes of water-
course areas vary between 50 and 200 ac each, with an average of 178 ac, and
the length averages about 7,000 ft. These watercourses directly serve about
25% of the bunded plots or basins having an average size of one ac. The re-
maining area, consisting mainly of bunded paddy fields, is supplied indirectly
from field to field. Basins are flat and generally well-levelled. For dry
season crops, basins are sometimes furrowed.
Floods and Flood Control
2.08      About 10,000 ac of the rehabilitation area have been affected
annually by flooding over the 1968-75 period. The Panlaung River is the
principal source of flooding, especially between the Nathwle and Kyime Weirs
where the bankful capacity (3,000 cusecs) is inadequate to control even small
floods. The river spills onto the adjacent land, which lies 8-9 ft below bank
level at certain locations. Between Nathwle and Kyime, low sections are pro-
vided with a 2-5 ft high embankment. There is only one flood escape structure
located on the left bank upstream from the Kyime Weir, and its escape capacity
is inadequate.
Farm Size, Land Tenure, and Population
2.09      Farm Size.  About 14,400 farm families, each averaging six persons,
occupy the 88,000 ac in the currently irrigated tract, while about 8,990 farm
families till the 102,500 ac 1/ of land in the currently dryland area. Aver-
age farm sizes therefore range from about 6 ac in the irrigated area to 11 ac
in the dryland area, compared with the national average of 5.4 ac. A more
detailed breakdown of farm areas and the number of farmers by farm size in-
terval is given in Annex 1, Tables 2 and 3.
2.10      Land Tenure.  In Burma, all land belongs to the State.  Cultivators
have been regarded as tenants of GOB since the enactment of the Tenancy Act
of 1964.  They cannot transfer land, and their heirs cannot possess land as a
matter of right. When a farmer dies, the Village Land Committee (VLC) may
distribute his land to another cultivator if the deceased leaves behind only
1/   Total new development area is 113,500 ac, of which 11,000 ac would be
cleared and developed with the project (para 5.14).



- 9 -
minor sons or if his sons are in non-farming occupations. VLC may even take
away all or part of a farmer's land under the Land Nationalization Act of 1953
for failing to grow prescribed crops. Land ownership in this context means
only the right of usufruct. The pattern of ownership is highly skewed in
the project area, as it is in all of Burma. In the currently irrigated area,
for example, 40% of farms are less than 4 ac in size but occupy only 17% of
total farmland. On the other hand, farms over 10 ac represent 20% of all
farms but occupy 48% of total farmland.
2.11      Population.  The population within the project area is estimated
to be about 200,000 distributed within the four townships. There are about
33,000 rural families, which include 23,000 farm families and 10,000 landless
families, the latter providing most of the necessary input of hired labor on
farms. At peak periods of agricultural activity, however, migrant labor comes
from the poor agricultural areas of neighboring Meiktila and Myingyan Townships.
This seasonal migration is expected to increase when the demand for hired labor
increases with pvoject development. Population data by tract appears in
Annex 1, Table 1.
Agricultural Practices, Yields, and Production
2.12      The currently irrigated tract in the project area is one of the few
places in the central dry zone under intensive cultivation. Cropping intensity
ranges from about 90 to 190% depending on the availability of irrigation water
in the dry season. Average intensity ranges from about 90% on partially irri-
gated ya land to 140% on paddyland, giving a weighted average of 125% for the
entire irrigated area. Paddy is the predominant crop (58%), followed by medium-
staple cotton (27%), sesame (15%), chillies (11%), pulses (8%), and onions
(6%). Present cropping patterns in this area are determined not only by soils,
availability of irrigation water, drainage, and prevailing market prices, but
also by special GOB programs. GOB now requires that priority in irrigation
water use be given to cotton in the dry season, and that farmers devote about
30% of farm area to this crop during this season.
2.13      Since the proposed new area is not currently served by any irriga-
tion system, crop production is entirely dependent on low and variable rain-
fall. Overall cropping intensity is only about 72% as large areas of culti-
vated land must at times be left fallow for lack of adequate soil moisture at
sowing time. Pulses are the principal crop (26%), followed by oilseeds (23%),
chillies (9%), short-staple cotton (8%), and paddy (6%). Details of project
area cropping patterns are given in Annex 1, Table 8.
2.14      Paddy grown is mostly indica-type, local varieties.  HYVs account
for only about 18% of area sown to paddy, mainly C4-63 and some IR-5. IR-20
and IR-22 varieties are just now being introduced. Because of water con-
straints in the dry season, paddy is cultivated at present chiefly in the
monsoon period. Monsoon paddy is transplanted in July-August and harvested
in December-January. Pre-monsoon HYV paddy, accounting for only 3% of paddy
acreage, is sown in April/May and harvested in July-August. With year-
round irrigation it would be possible to grow two crops of paddy (para 8.02).



- 10 -
2.15      Burma grows both short- and medium-staple cotton, all in the central
dry zone. Short-staple cottons are Gossypium Arboreum varieties (Mahlaing 5/6,
Wagyi, and Wagale) and medium-staple cottons, Gossypium Hirsutum varieties,
which include Stoneville 7 and Stoneville 213. During the 1978 season, the
project area contributed about 15% of the national crop estimated at 41,700
tons. Short-staple varieties are grown in the mid- to late-monsoon seasons on
upland areas as a rainfed crop, while medium-staple varieties are grown with
basin irrigation on flat land with heavy soils more suited to paddy culture
as a pre-monsoon crop. The present cropping season for medium-staple cotton
is unusual and inappropriate in that the crop is sown in February-March and
harvested in July-August during the mid-monsoon period. Irrigation water is
often in short supply during the growing season while later, heavy rains
coupled with poor drainage adversely affect yields as well as seed and lint
quality. Attempts are now being made to grow medium-staple crop as a late
monsoon crop on well-drained, irrigated ya land in Kyaukse Township adjacent
to the project area; results obtained at the region's Lungyaw cotton seed
farm are encouraging (Annex 1, Table 12).
2.16      Present crop yields are low.  Yields in the irrigated area average
only about 1,500 lbs per ac, local paddy; 1,900 lbs, HYV paddy; 500 lbs,
medium-staple cotton; 500 lbs, chillies; 170 lbs, sesame; 300 lbs, pulses;
and 3,600 lbs, onions. Low yields are primarily attributable to poor seeds,
unreliable supply of irrigation water, and absent or inadequate application
of fertilizers and pesticides. In the case of medium-staple cotton, an addi-
tional reason for low yields is the improper cropping season (para 2.15).
2.17      Present agricultural production from the project area comprises
about 38,800 tons paddy, 6,100 tons cotton, 3,400 tons chillies, 2,000 tons
sesame, 700 tons groundnut, 3,600 tons pulses, and 8,800 tons onions.
Agricultural Supporting Services
2.18      The Agriculture Corporation (AC) is responsible for agricultural
research and extension, procurement and supply of fertilizers and pesticides,
and land use investigation and records. The Agricultural Mechanization
Department (AMD) is responsible for providing custom tractor services at
subsidized rates, with priority given for cotton cultivation.
2.19      Research.  Basic research is done at the Agricultural Research
Institute (ARI) at Yezin, 100 mi south of the project area. ARI currently
is assisted by UNDP (equipment and staff) and by the IDA-financed Seeds
Project (land development) in research on training, soils, and crops (paddy,
pulses, and cotton). Applied research is carried out at the 16 central exper-
imental stations throughout the country. The Mandalay station specializes in
research on basin-irrigated cultivation of rice, chillies, oilseeds, pulses,
and onions while that at Mahlaing (about 70 mi southwest of the project area)
concentrates on short-staple cotton.   In addition, the Hlaingdet cotton farm
(70 mi southeast of the project area) conducts research on medium-staple cotton
under rainfed conditions.
2.20      ARI and the above-mentioned experimental farms would support the
project through relevant research efforts and provision of foundation seed.



- 11 -
However, since furrow irrigation is not yet practiced in Burma and since the
existing rainfed cotton research farms (Mahlaing, Hlaingdet, and Lungyaw) are
not typical of the ya land within the project area, it would be essential to
establish a new research farm stressing furrow irrigation for medium-staple
cotton and other upland crops for the newly irrigated area. This new farm
would also serve as a demonstration and training center (see para 5.22).
2.21      Agricultural Extension.  AC fields about 96 extension agents within
the four project townships, or on average about one agent per 600 farmers.
Through the years the extension service has proven ineffective because:
(a)  AC is required to give priority to the formulation and
implementation of annual regional and village agricultural
plans, encompassing production and input supply, rather
than farm-level extension;
(b)  AC's extension methods have become obsolete and over-
extended;
(c)  technical advice given to farmers often lags behind latest
research findings;
(d)  AC staff is handicapped by lack of transport and instruc-
tion materials; and
(e)  extension workers are frequently diverted to non-agricultural
work (e.g. accompanying township council members on various
administrative tours).
Recently AC has taken steps to strengthen its extension program including
progressive in-service training for extension workers and introduction of
the "Training and Visit" (T&V) system. The Ministry of Agriculture and
Forests intends to replicate T&V started under the Lower Burma Paddyland
Development I and II Projects (Cr. 642-BA and 835-BA) in the four project
townships. AC has also recently been relieved of responsibilities for cotton
and jute procurement thereby freeing manpower to concentrate on production-
oriented activities such as extension.
2.22      Inputs.  There are two AC seed farms in the project area, one for
paddy at Kyaukse and one for medium-staple cotton at Lungyaw. Paddy seeds
produced at the Kyaukse seed farm are multiplied by selected seed growers;
AC buys back seed produced at a 10% premium over the paddy procurement price.
Procured seeds are then sold by AC to farmers at cost. No meaningful quality
control is practiced, however, and seed is generally indistinguishable from
commercial grain. The quality of cotton seed is worse since there is no
properly organized cotton seed multiplication program. The Seeds Develop-
ment Project (Cr. 745-BA) would improve and expand seed industry development
through modest paddy and cotton seed multiplication programs. The Lyngyaw
seed farm would be one of six farms developed under the Seeds Project.
2.23      Although AC generally allocates fertilizers for application only
on HYV paddy and medium-staple cotton in the project area, farmers also use



- 12 -
fertilizers on attractive cash crops such as chillies, sesame, and onions.
Present application rates on HYV paddy and cotton are much below recommended
dosages. Controlled supplies, currently sold at subsidized prices (para 8.09),
are often insufficient to meet demand. Use of pesticides is also very limited
mainly because of inadequate sprayers and a basic lack of farmer confidence in
the efficacy of AC-supplied pesticides.
2.24      Farm Power Support.  Land preparation for crops other than cotton is
usually done by bullocks, while that for cotton is increasingly done by four-
wheel tractors, the services of which are generally hired from AMD at highly
subsidized rates (Annex 3, Table 14). GOB mandates that AMD give priority to
cotton. AMD has a medium-sized workshop at Myittha for repair of assemblies,
but this station is not as yet fully equipped. The tractor stations at Kyaukse
and Wundwin, which are maintained in temporary structures, have only hand
tools to service equipment.
2.25      Agricultural Credit.  The Myanma Agricultural Bank (MAB) was estab-
lished in 1976 to reactivate provision of seasonal, medium-, and long-term
credit to farmers through the existing Township Banks (TBs) and Village Banks
(VBs), as was the case prior to 1974. With the termination of the advance
purchase system for paddy in 1978, seasonal credit to paddy farmers is now
provided by MAB through TBs and VBs with assistance from the Township and Vil-
lage People's Councils. This change was chiefly responsible for the seven-
fold increase in MAB loans made in 1979 (K 822.3 M) over 1978 levels. Recovery
is made with the help of the above councils and the Agriculture and Farm
Produce Trade Corporation (AFPTC), responsible for compulsory procurement
collections; the loan recovery rate historically has been good (averaging
93.2%, 1976-78). The current rate of K 70 per ac of paddy is considered
inadequate. MAB has recently taken the initiative to provide seasonal loans
for paddy at enhanced rates varying from K 100/ac for ordinary varieties to
K 280/ac for special HYVs for farmers participating in the IDA-financed Lower
Burma Paddy Development Projects and the ADB-financed Sedawgyi Project. Also,
as MAB formulates a medium- and long-term lending program through technical
assistance financed by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the
UK, it would start lending for land clearing, equipment such as power tillers
and sprayers, cattle, and other capital investments.
2.26      Farmers receive interest-free advance purchase payments for cotton
at the rate of K 210/ac from the Textile Corporation (TexCorp) under the
Ministry of Industries I (MI-1). Advance purchases for other crops (sesame,
groundnuts, and chillies), at about 55% of the estimated production value, are
provided by farmer cooperatives. MAB also provides seasonal credit for cash
crops (other than cotton); but for these crops, farmers have generally relied
on their own resources.
Marketing and Processing
2.27      Farmers are required to sell specified minimum quantities of paddy
to AFPTC according to a progressive quota system and may sell any remainder
on the open market usually only within their own townships. Paddy procured
by AFPTC is milled at Kume, Myittha, Wundwin, and Kyaukse which have a total
milling capacity of about 50,000 tons p.a. At present, however, only about



- 13 -
one-third of this capacity is used (para 8.13). Quantities of paddy reserved
for on-farm consumption is generally processed at home or at small artisanal
village mills. Most medium-staple cotton produced is sold to TexCorp. Seed
cotton purchased is ginned and baled, and the lint is supplied to TexCorp
mills. Ginning is performed near Kyaukse and Myittha, and all baling at
Kyaukse. With the exception of one roller ginning unit established recently,
practically all ginning facilities in use are antiquated and were originally
installed to process short-staple cotton. The marketing system for the cash
crops such as chillies, oilseeds, and onions is private and well-organized.
Transportation
2.28      The main highway from Rangoon to Mandalay passes through the Kume
within the project area. Myittha is on a road that branches off from this
highway and goes west to Myingyan. A road from Kyaukse to Tada-U skirts the
northern boundary of the project area. An unpaved road along canal banks
connects the Lungyaw farm to the main highway. Busses travel frequently along
the main highway, providing transportation to farmers with small amounts of
vegetables (chillies, onions, tomatoes) for marketing in Kyaukse and Mandalay.
Larger quantities of vegetables, paddy, cotton, and sesame are trucked to
Mandalay. Trucks, both private and state-owned, also travel to Myingyan,
Meiktila, and Rangoon. The Rangoon-Mandalay railway line passes through
Kyaukse, thus also providing railway linkage with the project area.
III. POWER SYSTEM, SALES, AND DEMAND FORECAST
Existing Facilities
A.   Generation
3.01      The Electric Power Corporation (EPC) is principally responsible for
the generation and distribution of power in Burma, although some industries
and institutions have small power plants for their own use. EPC has in serv-
ice a total of 390 MW of generating capacity, or 86% of the total generating
capacity in Burma. EPC's total generation in 1978 was 931 GWh, of which 72%
was supplied by the 168 MW Lawpita Hydro Power Station--the only major hydro
power station in the country--located about 220 mi northeast of Rangoon.
There are four thermal power stations, namely Kyunchaung Gas Turbine (54 MW),
Myanaung Gas Turbine (49 MW), Ahlone Steam (35 MW), and Ywama Steam (30 MW),
which respectively provided 14%, 3%, 3%, and 0.5% of EPC's total generation
in 1978. The remaining 7.5% was supplied by 50-1,000 kW diesel generators
scattered throughout the country with a total capacity of 54 MW (Map IBRD
14546).
B.   Transmission and Distribution
3.02      A 230 kV transmission line (250 mi) between Lawpita station and
Rangoon and a 132 kV transmission line (225 mi) between Lawpita station and

Mandalay form the hydro-grid system that integrates Lawpita, Ahlone, and
Ywaman power stations and five major substations having a total capacity of
244 MVA. The Kyunchaung gas turbine station, which operates on non-associated
gas and is located about 100 mi southwest of Mandalay, is connected with this
hydro-grid system at Chauk, but is operated electrically independent due to
the sensitivity of the Sale fertilizer plant to fluctuations in voltage.
3.03      Myanaung gas turbine station, which is located about 120 mi north-
west of Rangoon and also operates mainly on non-associated gas, supplies
electricity to Prome and the northern part of the Irrawaddy Division through
a 66 kV transmission line (60 mi). An additional 66 kV transmission line,
financed by ADB, from Myanaung station to Myaungmya (160 mi) has recently been
completed, supplying electricity to almost half of the Irrawaddy Division from
Myanaung.
3.04      The distribution system consists of about 730 mi of 33 kV primary
distribution line and 6,800 mi of various secondary distribution lines at 11,
6.6, 3.3, and 0.4 kV. Losses in the EPC system, including station use, have
decreased from 29% in 1970 to 24% in 1978. The latter figure compares with
33% in Nepal (Nepal Electricity Corporation) and 37% in Bangladesh (Bangladesh
Power Development Board). According to EPC's loss analysis for 1977, the
breakdown of losses was 2.1% for station use, 6.7% for transmission, and 16.4%
for distribution. High distribution losses are mainly due to overloading in
distribution systems in Rangoon and Mandalay. EPC has obtained a US$20 M
suppliers' credit from Yugoslavia to augment its distribution systems and
plans to reduce total system losses to 20% by 1986.
Energy Sales and Consumption
3.05      EPC's annual generation and energy sales since 1970 are shown in
Annex 1, Table 13. EPC's sales increased at an average annual growth rate of
10.3% during the period 1970-78. The average growth rate was 9.3% p.a. during
the first 4-1/2 years, and increased to 11.8% during the last three years of
SFYP. The Burmese economy as a whole is expected to achieve at least as high
a growth rate during the next few years under TFYP (1979-82). Sales by con-
sumer category are noted in Annex 1, Table 14.
3.06      The past growth rate of the largest energy sales category, namely
industrial consumption, increased to 15.2% p.a. during the 1975-78 period
compared with 12.7% in 1970-75. The share of industrial sales increased from
46% in 1970 to 57% in 1978, indicating the country's progress in industrial-
ization. TFYP proposes even faster industrialization, targeting 12.2% annual
average growth for the industrial sector as compared with its past record of
7%, in 1975-78.
3.07      Domestic electricity consumption increased 10.1% p.a. during the
last three years compared with an annual growth rate of 6.5% during the pre-
vious 4-1/2 years. However, consumption per customer still remains low at
about 450 kWh p.a. The share of domestic sales decreased from 32% in 1970
to 27% in 1978. Other usage (commercial, street lighting, etc.) shared only
16% of total sales in 1978.

Demand Forecast
3.08      EPC's demand forecast, covering the period up to 1991, provides
for an average annual growth rate of 10.8% in total sales and 10.5% in system
demand over the 1978-91 period. This forecast is based on category-wise pro-
jections of energy requirements, taking into account the historical growth
rate for each consumer category and superimposing the energy requirements of
new large industries that are expected to materialize within the next five
years.
3.09      Projected growth rates in sales by each consumer category until 1986,
when the proposed Nyaunggyat project comes on stream, are summarized below:
Annual Growth Rate in Sales
(in percent)
(Actual)    --------(Forecast)------
Sales Category                 1975-78      1978-86            1978-91
Domestic                          10.1         10.4              10.4
Industrial                       15.2          15.6              12.3
Large Industries              22.0         19.5                 -
Small & Medium Industries    7.3             7.0                -
Other Usage                        4.3          1.6               1.7
Total Sales                 11.8         12.7               10.8
3.10      The average annual increase in energy sales is projected at 14.2%
to 1984 compared with 11.8% over the past three years.  Beyond 1984, EPC has
conservatively projected an increase in demand of about 8% p.a. since little
reliable information is available especially concerning industrial demand (70%
of projected total sales in 1984). Consequently, the average annual projected
increase to 1986 would be 12.7% p.a.
3.11      Based on projected energy sales, the system's peak load was esti-
mated by taking into account expected improvement in losses and load factors.
The loss factor is expected to improve from the present 24% to 20% by 1986
and the load factor from 63% at present to 65% by 1982. Demand forecasts to
1991 are shown in Annex 1, Table 15.
Current Development Program
3.12      The current development program for the EPC system is derived, in
part, from recommendations of a power sector survey carried out in 1978 under
the UNDP/IDA Burma Umbrella Project, designed to forecast a long-term power
demand and to establish a sound development plan for the power sector. The
current development program for new generating plants is shown in Annex 1,
Table 17. GOB has committed itself to installing six 18 MW gas turbines: two
in Mann for operation mainly on associated gas, two in Prome for operation on
associated and non-associated gas, and two in Rangoon for operation on heavy
residual oil. Additionally, GOB has recently obtained financing from ADB to
construct the Sedawgyi hydroelectric plant (two 12.5 MW turbines), which will



- 16 -
come on stream in 1984. The development program currently includes three
additional power plants: Chauk (18 MW gas-fired thermal), Yenangyaung (18 MW
gas-fired thermal), and Zangtu (24 MW hydro). The two thermal power plants
would substitute for the capacity of Ahlone (30 MW), which is currently
planned for retirement by 1982. GOB also plans to connect the two new thermal
power plants (Chauk and Yenangyaung) with the committed Mann and Prome gas
turbine plants by a 132/230 kV transmission line. All of these projects are
planned for completion before the proposed Nyaunggyat power plant.
3.13      A full appraisal of EPC and the power sector was not expected to be
carried out. Hence, confirmation was not obtained that EPC's current develop-
ment program is in fact the least cost long-term expansion plan. Questions
affecting such a confirmation would include: verification that economic and
sufficient gas is available at Chauk and Yenangyaung for the generation pro-
posed; whether the Ahlone thermal plant should be retired in the near future
or retained for reserve; and a load flow analysis to establish the need for
adequate transmission capacity between Rangoon and Chauk (para 5.35).
Need for Additional Power Projects
3.14      The peak demand/generating capacity balance in the hydro-grid system
(Annex 1, Table 17) indicates that existing reserve capacity plus additional
capacity obtained from committed generating plants will be fully utilized by
1985. As far as the peak demand/generating capacity balance is concerned, it
was assumed that new capacity in Chauk and Yenangyaung would replace that
retired at Ahlone. To meet demand growth after 1985, GOB plans to construct
the Zangtu hydro plant (24 MW), the study of which, however, is still in an
early stage. Even if the Zangtu plant were completed, based on demand fore-
casts, the system would still require additional capacity in 1986. Although
the power survey under the UNDP/IDA Burma Umbrella Project identified the
Paunglaung hydroelectric project (136 MW), the earliest feasible completion
date for this project would be about 1988, considering the time needed for
preparation of detailed designs and financing arrangements. Since there are
no other hydro schemes ready for implementation, the projected power demand
could be met by either the proposed Nyaunggyat project or a fossil fuel
thermal alternative (paras 9.07 and 9.08).
Need for Extended Transmission System
3.15      Considering its geographic location, the proposed Nyaunggyat plant
would supply electric power mainly to the Mandalay, Thazi, and Chauk substa-
tions. Existing transformer capacities in these three substations are 36 MVA,
15 MVA, and 40 MVA, respectively. The Thazi substation is already fully
loaded, and projected demand will exceed the transformer capacity of the
Mandalay substation before the Nyaunggyat plant comes on stream. These two
substations, therefore, need extension (para 5.36).
3.16      EPC's future development program includes a Thazi-Toungoo trans-
mission line in 1985. This transmission line is designed to transmit power
north to south and to increase system reliability, thereby reducing the
vulnerability of the Lawpita-Toungoo and Lawpita-Thazi transmission lines.
Considering the future development of the Paunglaung hydroelectric project



- 17 -
as well as system stability, this transmission line should be a 230 kV line
instead of 132 kV, as currently planned (para 5.36).
IV. PROJECT INVESTIGATIONS AND SUITABILITY
Investigations and Project Formulation
4.01      Engineering investigations of the Nyaunggyat dam site to develop
water storage along Panlaung River were first undertaken during the 1967-71
period by the Irrigation Department (ID), assisted by the Soviet Consulting
Engineers of Salkhozpromexport, USSR. These investigations resulted in the
1971 report, "Nyaunggyat Reservoir Project," leading to a request in 1973 for
IDA assistance in financing the project. In 1975, Engineering Consultants,
Inc. was commissioned to prepare a feasibility report with subsequent appraisal
by IDA in May-June 1976. During field appraisal the mission concluded that
the geological soundness of the dam site was questionable and that a more
detailed investigation of the upper and lower dam sites was necessary for
sound development.
4.02      Further engineering studies of the Nyaunggyat Dam, financed from
IDA Cr. 483, were carried out by Lahmeyer International (LI) of the Federal
Republic of Germany (FRG), engaged by GOB in 1977 to investigate both the
upper and lower dam sites and to conduct a feasibility study for the more
suitable site. The consultant's detailed investigations and studies confirmed
the previous appraisal mission's views about the unsuitable geological condi-
tions at the lower dam site. A feasibility report for the selected upper dam
site was completed in October 1978. Field investigations of the irrigation
service area were carried out by ID and FAO culminating in a "Draft Report of
the Nyaunggyat Dam Irrigation Project," prepared by FAO in 1976 and revised
in 1978. These thorough investigations, studies, and reports formed the basis
of the subsequent project appraisal by IDA, along with representatives of
three potential co-financiers (KfW, ODA, and Norway) in April-May 1979. This
appraisal then led to the proposed project that is based on sound engineering
standards and has dimensions of all major structures optimized and defined.
Dam Site and Location
4.03      Extensive field explorations have been accomplished on the proposed
Nyaunggyat project during the past ten years. The work has consisted of local
and regional surface mapping and subsurface core drilling, test pit excavation,
and tunnel driving. The result of this effort was the selection of the most
appropriate site for the main dam and the water holding capability of the
reservoir basin. The dam would be located in a narrow gorge formed by the
Panlaung River as it cuts sharply through a ridge of jurassic quartzite
capped by limestone of the same geologic age (Map IBRD 14544).
Optimization of Project Features
4.04      Once the dam site was decided, the project features were optimized
for the maximum operating level of the reservoir; the subsequent selection



- 18 -
of the dam crest, elevation and spillway capacity, location and dimension of
the other structures, and the determination of the power plant's installed
capacity were all based on economic comparisons. The maximum operating level
of the reservoir was fixed at 680 ft (dam crest 700 ft), which was the switch-
ing value level (incremental benefits equal to incremental costs) with irri-
gation alone as well as with both irrigation and power.
Geology
4.05      Main Dam.  A sound metamorphosed sedimentary rock foundation exists
at the main dam site that would support the proposed structure to the maximum
height desired. Minor faulting and joints are closely spaced, complex, and
erratically orientated; but groundwater levels and water pressure percolation
tests in the foundation drill holes indicate the jointing is well-cemented and
relatively impermeable. The quartzite rock segments, although fractured, are
angular and thus very stable under conditions of loading.
4.06      Allied Structures.  The three dike structures, S1, S2$ and S3 (Map
IBRD 14544), would be founded on a shallow depth of overburden on intrusive
igneous rock and geologically, the foundation conditions are generally quite
favorable. Other structures, including the powerhouse, service and emergency
spillways, and the diversion, irrigation, and power tunnel, would be founded
predominantly on hard and jointed quartzite rock, qualifying as sound found-
ation material. Grouting to moderate depths would be necessary beneath the
main dam and allied structures.
4.07      Reservoir Area.  Surface geological studies of the proposed reservoir
basin indicate its water holding capability would be satisfactory. There are
outcrops of karstic limestone formations in the basin area, but the existing
faulting and lenticular bedding, their elevations, inclinations, and ground-
water characteristics lead to the conclusion that there would be no continuous
seepage paths and that no leakage from the reservoir would be expected through
these limestone formations.
4.08      Re-regulating Dam.  Geological exploration at the re-regulating
dam site just upstream from Kinda Weir has revealed unfavorable foundation
conditions. Proposals are now under study for constructing a re-regulating
dam at Kinda Weir for re-regulation pondage. The detailed proposals are
expected to be finalized with assistance from LI by May 1980.
Seismicity
4.09      The proposed Nyaunggyat project area is located within an active
seismic area (Map IBRD 14543). Three disastrous earthquakes, having inten-
sities of 8-9 on the Modified Mercalli (MM) scale, were recorded during the
last 150 years with epicenters within a radius of 100 mi of the project site.
Project structures would be designed for safe seismic loading with horizontal
and vertical accelerations of 0.25 and 0.083 g, respectively, acting contin-
uously and simultaneously. These accelerations correspond to an earthquake
registering 8-9 on the MM scale at the dam site, which is considered quite
adequate and safe for design of project structures.



- 19 -
Hydrology
4.10      The Panlaung River drains about 49,440 M cu ft (1,400 M m3 ) of
runoff yearly from about 865 sq mi of the catchment area upstream of the dam
site, which has an average annual rainfall of about 42 in. The river basin,
located in the rain-shadow area, has a karstic limestone base with consid-
erable underground storage capable of trapping rainwater and subsequently
releasing trapped water into baseflow. Only a few major floods have occurred
during this century; the maximum peak was recorded in 1926 estimated at 60,000
cusecs. Historical flood data may not be adequately reliable due to poor
gauging procedures. Based on a more reliable regional statistical approach,
estimated flood peaks would range from 60,000 cusecs for a 25-year flood,
67,000 cusecs for 50-year, 76,000 cusecs for 100-year, 106,000 cusec fo 
1,000-year, 141,000 cusecs for 10,000-year, and 229,500 cusecs (6,500 m /sec)
as the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF).
Sedimentation
4.11      Estimates of sediment loads transported by the river into the pro-
posed Nyaunggyat reservoir were based on samplings of the suspended loads
and on the proportion of the bed-loads. The total load, which is equal to
an average annual depth of erosion of about 0.012 in. over the catchment
area above the dam site, agrees with that observed in other basins in the
region with similar physical characteristics. Mean annual sediment inflow
into the Nyaunggyat reservoir would be about 830,000 tons and the volume of
sediment trapped in 100 years will be about 86 M cu yd. The dead storage of
the reservoir would be set at El. 551 ft (168 m) to accommodate this volume,
which provides more than ample sediment storage.
Construction Materials
4.12      General.  Between 1971-76 many field and laboratory investigations
were performed to confirm the suitability and availability of sufficient
earth and rock construction materials for both the main dam and dikes. This
program was continued during 1977-79 while LI prepared the feasibility study,
with additional exploration including drill holes along the dam alignment and
affiliated structures, supplemented by several pits of shallow depth, and
about 20 deep trenches excavated by equipment (depths varying from 8.2-16.4
ft) for core and shell materials.
4.13      Core/Shell Materials.  Impervious core material is found along the
Panlaung River as "Terra Rosa" deposits and as colluvium along the lower por-
tions of the side slopes in the reservoir basin just upstream from the axis
on both sides of the river channel. This material is adequately located in a
stretch of at least 1.4 mi on the left river bank and approximately 0.6 mi on
the right bank. The range of grain size distributions of this CL-type soil
is adequate and quite favorable. The slope wash material of quartzite and
intrusive origin that forms the lower slopes of both the river banks, consists
of a sandy matrix of considerably higher shear strength and permeability and
is suitable outer shell material.



- 20 -
4.14      Rockfill/Riprap.  In the hills on the right river bank, large ex-
posures of in situ quartzite rock confirm that a sufficient amount of free
draining material would be available for rockfill within a short distance of
the dam site. Quartzite, limestone, and diorite rock outcrops are found near
all the project features, and each one would provide a quarry source for
riprap, rockfill, and an alternate source for concrete aggregate. The lime-
stone cap above the present camp site is proposed as the source of riprap
material.
4.15      Concrete Aggregates and Filter Material.  Sand and gravel filter
material and concrete aggregates would be available from deposits near Kanzi
located 3-4 mi downstream from the dam. The strength of concrete cubes cast
and tested has been found to be fairly high. A program of further tests on
aggregates and filter materials is in progress. Crushing of cobbles; washing,
fractioning, and crushing of oversized particles; and selection of particular
fraction sizes will be necessary to obtain optimum concrete mixes.
4.16      Additional Explorations.  To pinpoint and classify additional
sources of natural gravel and rock and other construction materials, addi-
tional exploration and extensive field work would be required to outline and
designate the borrow areas specifically. These explorations pertaining to
(a) construction materials, (b) powerhouse and spillway foundations, and
(c) concrete mix, needed for final design and construction specifications,
are expected to be completed by July 1980.
Reservoir Operation
4.17      Reservoir operation studies were performed for the selected project
variant with a maximum operating level of 680 ft (207.25 m). The monthly
reservoir operation studies were computerized and were based on historical
inflows/outflows (1950-77), corrected for lateral inflow between the dam
site and Kinda Weir, evaporation, seepage losses, and future sedimentation.
Reservoir releases would primarily correspond to irrigation demand. During.
periods when no water would be required for irrigation, water would be released
to maintain power output. The minimum daily operation of the Nyaunggyat power
plant would be based on six hours of generation per day, while the turbine
discharge must be supplied to the irrigation system at a constant rate. The
final reservoir operation studies demonstrate that guaranteed peak power
production would equal about 28 MW at a 90% probability level or 25 MW at a
98% probability level. The average monthly peak generating capacity would be
about 44 MW, and the average annual energy would be about 165 GWh.
V. THE PROJECT
General
5.01      The proposed project would be the first phase of a long-term pro-
gram to develop the land and water resources of the Panlaung and Samon River
valleys in Kyaukse, Myittha, Tada-U, and Wundwin Townships located in Burma's
central dry zone. The project would provide year-round irrigation capability
for approximately 200,000 ac of land. A major part of the proposed area



- 21 -
(88,000 ac), located mainly on the right bank of the Panlaung River and
in the area between the two rivers, is under an existing system commanded by
Kinda Weir, which currently can only supply irrigation during the monsoon
season for one crop. New lands to be developed by the project are generally
further upstream along the left bank of the Samon River.
Project Objectives
5.02      The primary objectives of the project would be to provide a comple-
mentary agricultural development program geared to increase production of paddy,
cotton, oilseeds-, and other crops by increasing yields and cropping intensi-
ties. The project would provide for the rehabilitation of the existing ineffi-
cient and severely silted-up irrigation system, construction of irrigation
facilities for new areas, flood control and drainage improvements, on-farm
development works, improved water management, and research and extension. The
project would alsd provide for hydro-electric power generation with a maximum
generating capacity of 56 MW and an average annual energy production of about
165 GWh.
Project Components
5.03      The project, to be implemented over a six-year period by GOB agen-
cies listed below, would include the following components:
(a) Irrigation Department (ID)

and equipment for extension activities.
(d) Agricultural Mechanization Department (AMD)
(i) Provision of equipment for AMD tractor workshops
and for land clearing and rough land levelling.
5.04      The project would also provide for technical assistance and training
(para 5.26).
Detailed Features
A. Nyaunggyat Dam and Reservoir
5.05      Main Dam and Dikes.  The main dam (an earth and rockfill structure)
with a central core and appurtenant spillway and outlet works would be con-
structed on the Panlaung River about 9 mi upstream from the existing Kinda
Weir.  Three saddle dikes, S, S2, and S3 (Map IBRD 14544), varying in height
from about 70 to 125 ft, wouId be required to contain the reservoir.  The
construction of the main dam and saddle dikes at the proposed sites would
provide a reservoir with a total storage of about 34,300 M cu ft at the maxi-
mum operating level of 680 ft and an active storage of 27,000 M cu ft. The
surface area of this reservoir would be 14 sq mi at the maximum operating
level and six sq mi at the minimum operating level.



- 23 -
5.06      Diversion Works, Headrace Tunnel, and Irrigation Outlet.  The diver-
sion works would consist of a diversion tunnel and upstream and downstream
diversion channels with diversion dikes in the riverbed. After completion of
the project, the diversion tunnel, 1,480 ft (450 m) long and 24.6 ft (7.5 m)
in diameter, would be used as a headrace tunnel for irrigation and power
releases. The headrace tunnel would be structurally divided into three
sections: a concrete-lined section, a steel-lined section, and a manifold
system with bifurcation. An irrigation outlet would be provided through a
control valve in the headrace tunnel (Map IBRD 14544).
5.07      Service Spillway.  The service spillway (Map IBRD 14544) would con-
sist of a gated weir section, an open chute with a flip bucket, and a plunge
pool. The spillway would be designed to discharge safely the estimated 1,000-
year flood, while the combined capacity with the emergency spillway would pass
the PMF. Hydraulic model tests were performed at the Karlsruhe Hydraulic
Laboratory, FRG, to determine accurately the proper shape and size of all
parts of the spillway.
B.   Powerhouse and Affiliated Works
5.08      Powerhouse.  The powerhouse would be a shaft-like, partially under-
ground, concrete structure in sound rock, designed to resist heavy earthquakes
and tailwater pressures during floods. The powerhouse would accommodate two
Francis turbine generating units of 28 MW each, along with auxiliary equipment,
control room, workshops, and other service facilities, utilizing a head of
about 115-220 ft. An overhead travelling 120-ton crane would facilitate the
installation, unloading, and handling of equipment within the powerhouse area.
5.09      A power intake structure would be constructed in an open cut excava-
tion on the left bank immediately upstream of the dam. A single intake tunnel
about 100 ft (30 m) long would connect the intake structure to the diversion
tunnel and then to the inlet manifold of the powerhouse. A re-regulating dam
would be constructed at the existing Kinda Weir site providing a re-regulating
volume of about 60 M cu ft. This would allow the power plant to vary water
flow and thereby meet the grid's peak needs without adversely affecting water
flow for irrigation.
5.10      Transformer, Switchyard, and Transmission Line.  The transformer
bay would consist of a concrete structure connected with bus bar ducts to the
powerhouse. Seven single-phase transformers, including one spare for emergency
purposes, with rated output of 35/3 MVA each would be installed to step up
generating voltage of 11 kV to transmission voltage of 132 kV. The trans-
formers would be connected to the 132 kV switchyard by open-air conductors,
which would consist of one transmission line feeder. The power plant would
be connected to the nearest substation at Thazi (about 31 mi from the power-
house) and thus be integrated into the national hydro-grid system by a single-
circuit 132 kV transmission line (Map IBRD 14546).
C.   Access Road
5.11      An access to the dam site would be provided through construction of
a new 21 mi road that would run from a point near Kume along the Mandalay-



- 24 -
Rangoon highway to the dam site through Kinda Weir. The road alignment has
already been surveyed. The roadway would have a width of 34.5 ft including
shoulders and 14.5 ft pavement, and several bridges and culverts would have
to be built for passage of heavy equipment. To avoid delays in project imple-
mentation and resulting increased project costs, the access road to the dam
site would be completed by force account (para 6.12).
D.   Rehabilitation of Existing Irrigation and Drainage System
5.12      The proposed works for the rehabilitation of the currently irrigated
area A (88,000 ac) include the desilting of canals (640,000 cu yd); excavation
of new distributaries (40,000 cu yd); installation of measuring devices (140);
excavation of drains (700,000 cu yd); construction of flood embankments (2.0 M
cu yd); and repair and replacement of canal structures, road improvement, and
on-farm development. The existing natural drains would be improved in about
63,000 ac of this area by deepening and upgrading drains and excavating
supplementary secondary drains (Annex 2(c), Table 4).
E.   Irrigation Works for New Area Development
5.13      New irrigation systems would extend to areas C, D, E, and F cover-
ing a total area of 113,500 ac (Map IBRD 14545) as follows:
Acres
Area C - Between Area E on the left bank of
the Samon River and the right bank
of the Thin Bon River                           25,000
Area D - Adjacent Area C extending up to
natural drainage                                34,500
Area E - The most upstream area on right and
left banks of Samon River                      25,000
Area F - Adjacent Area D extending up to the
left bank of the Irrawaddy River               29,000
113,500
5.14      Works proposed for the new development area include construction of
the main diversion canal and an irrigation canal system, including canal struc-
tures, excavation of secondary and tertiary drains, road construction along the
main canal, land development works, and on-farm development. The total length
of the main canal would be 78 mi, including about 25 mi of lined channel to
prevent canal seepage losses. Six inverted syphons and one aquaduct would be
provided as major drainage crossings. The total length of distributaries
would be approximately 150 mi, and of minors, 300 mi. Roads along the main
canals measuring about 110 mi would be provided for both maintenance of irri-
gation works and usage as farm roads (Annex 2(c), Tables 4-8).
F.   On-Farm Development
5.15      Proposed on-farm development would mainly be limited to rehabilita-
tion of watercourses, replacement of deficient outlets, and construction of
new watercourses and outlets for improved water control. Within watercourse



- 25 -
areas, water distribution would be improved by extending watercourses to reach
each farm. Additionally, measuring devices would be installed at heads of
main canals and other selected reaches for accurate measurement of discharges
(Annex 2(c), Tables 4-8).
G.   Flood Control Works
5.16      The flood protection works against Panlaung River flooding would be
constructed between Nathwle and Htongyi along the right bank of the Panlaung
River. The Pauk Chaung channel would also be contained within flood embank-
ments. These works would be designed to enable the Panlaung River downstream
of the dam site to carry the 50-year outflow. The designed flood protection
embankments, located at least 100 ft from the river bank, would have a crest
width of 10 ft and upstream/downstream slopes of 1.5 to 1 and would be con-
structed with well-compacted, impervious material. The railway crossing in
the Pauk Chaung would be protected by concrete blocks, and the existing
inadequate escape would be replaced by a new structure (Annex 2(c), Table 4).
H.   Construction and O&M Support
5.17      Because of the general short supply and poor operating condition
of equipment in the country, new equipment in quantities needed to construct
and operate civil works would be provided by the project. The equipment would
be delivered to ID for use in the construction of civil works, as well as for
construction of the access road and other mobilization items for the Nyaunggyat
dam. Procurement of new equipment would include the concurrent purchase of
spare parts to ensure satisfactory operational life. After completion of
construction, heavy construction equipment would be used for O&M.
5.18      Office buildings, residential quarters, garages, godowns, workshops,
and other buildings would be required for O&M of the project. To the extent
practical, these O&M buildings would be constructed at the beginning of the
construction season for use by GOB staff assigned during construction. These
buildings would then be converted for permanent O&M use after construction
activities are completed (Annex 2(c), Table 9).
I.   Agricultural Supporting Services
5.19      For intensive agricultural development, including increased produc-
tion of HYV paddy and large-scale introduction of medium-staple cotton, the
project would strengthen agricultural extension, operate cotton demonstration
plots, establish a central research farm for irrigated cotton, and improve
input supply and agricultural mechanization services (Annex 2(d), Table 1).
5.20      Agricultural Extension.  The Training and Visit (T&V) program would
be introduced in the entire Kyaukse, Myittha, Wundwin, and Tada-U Townships.
The program would require provision of additional staff, use of "contact"
farmers, adoption of regularly scheduled farm visits, periodic training, and
intensification of field activities, including regular field scouting to deter-
mine the numbers and kinds of pests on farmers' crops, particularly cotton.
Initially, Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs) would be trained at Mandalay and



- 26 -
Hlaingdet and in special cases at ARI at Yezin. Village Extension Managers
(VEMs) would then be trained by SMSs focusing on topics relevant to farmers'
field activities during each particular crop season. The project would pro-
vide necessary incremental staff (Annex 2(d) Table 4), training centers,
equipment, and transport to support these efforts (Annex 2(d), Table 2). The
project would also cover incremental pay and allowances of extension staff as
well as associated fuel and maintenance costs.
5.21      Demonstration Plots.  The project would introduce furrow irrigation
with drainage onto ya land within the project area. Since this type of irri-
gation is not currently practiced in Burma, it would be necessary to (a) in-
vestigate water management and agronomic problems; (b) test various cropping
and water management systems; (c) train agricultural staff in furrow irrigated
cropping (particularly of late monsoon medium-staple cotton); and (d) give
demonstrations to farmers. Accordingly, the project would operate about four
demonstration plots in selected areas, to introduce year-round irrigation
either by a gravity system or by pumping from surface or groundwater sources,
thus, providing an excellent base on which to begin larger scale irrigation
upon completion of project works.
5.22      Research.  The existing Lungyaw cotton seed farm is neither easily
accessible nor typical of the newly irrigated ya land on which development of
medium-staple cotton and other cash crops under furrow irrigation would be
concentrated. The project would therefore establish a new irrigation research,
demonstration, and training center on about 100 ac in the new area, which
should be operational by the end of the six-year construction period. These
project area-specific cotton demonstration and research efforts are expected
to complement broader interventions proposed under the UNDP-assisted Cotton
Development Project (US$2.2 M), emphasizing dryland cotton research and devel-
opment at Meiktila, post-harvest technology, adaptability trials, training,
model plots, and pilot promotion campaigns.
5.23      Agricultural Credit.  The proposed Nyaunggyat project contains no
credit component. IDA is currently exploring with GOB the possibility of
formulating a nationwide agricultural credit project. It is anticipated that
this proposed credit project would be implemented by the time of completion
of Nyaunggyat project works and therefore would directly complement agricul-
tural development under the Nyaunggyat project. To permit realization of
agricultural production potential resulting from project investments, assur-
ances were obtained from GOB that it would make arrangements to provide
adequate seasonal and investment credit to project area farmers.
J.  Farm Power Support
5.24      To strengthen the existing agricultural mechanization services
and provide facilities for land clearing and rough land levelling for new
land development in areas C, D, E and F, the project would provide for:
(i) construction of tractor sheds and staff quarters and provision of
workshop equipment and tools for workshops at Myittha, Kyauskse and Wundwin
for repair and servicing of farm tractors; and (ii) procurement of ten
crawler tractors with implements and spares and other equipment for land
clearing and rough land levelling.

K.   Pilot Groundwater Scheme
5.25      The groundwater potential of Burma's dry zone is currently being
investigated under the UNDP/IDA Burma Umbrella Project. As part of these
investigations, about 85 fully developed wells are to be installed having
capacities ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 cusecs. Under Phase I of the pilot devel-
opment scheme, begun in December 1978, drilling and hydrologic equipment, well
materials, and pumps were provided to enable drilling and equipping of 36
productive wells. The proposed Nyaunggyat project would provide financing
for Phase II, which would include drilling and installation of remaining
wells, provision of tubewell equipment, and related technical assistance.
The second phase would be implemented over a two-year period by ID.
L.   Technical Assistance 1/
5.26      To strengthen the implementation capacity of the various implement-
ing agencies, the project would include the following technical assistance
services:
(a) Expatriate engineering consultancy services for:
(i)  preparation of construction designs, construction
specifications, and detailed construction drawings
for the Nyaunggyat dam, power plant, and allied
structures; supervision of construction and quality
control; preparation of an operational manual for
the dam and power plant; and final testing of the
plant (360 man-months for dam and 120 man-months
for power); 2/

man-month (individual specialists) and from US$8,000-12,000 per man-
month (consulting firms), depending on the specialty and assignment
duration. The average cost for an individual specialist would be about
US$6,000 per man-month consisting of salary (US$4,000), allowances
(US$1,000), travel (US$500), and settlement and miscellaneous expenses
(US$500). The average cost for consulting firm expertise would be about
US$10,000 per man-month, consisring of salary (US$3,500), overhead charges
(US$4,500), allowances (US$1,000) travel (US$500), and settlement and
miscellaneous expenses (US$500).
2/   Consulting firms.

5.27      Assurances were obtained from GOB that consultants would be appointed
to assist the various project agencies in the above activities, including con-
sultants hired for detailed engineering and design of the Paunglaung hydroelec-
tric project, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.

Water Supply and Demand
5.28      Water Supply.  The project would derive its water supply entirely
from the Panlaung River on which the Nyaunggyat dam and reservoir would be
constructed. The runoff from the catchment area upstream from the dam site is
quite variable and available mainly in the monsoon season. Over the 1950-77
period, annual runoff has varied from a minimum of about 34,080 M cu ft (1972)
to a maximum 84,800 M cu ft (1956), compared to an annual average of about
50,000 M cu ft. Runoff would be stored and regulated by the proposed Nyaunggyat
reservoir for year-round irrigation and power generation. Releases from the
proposed Nyaunggyat reservoir of about 48,000 M cu ft yearly would be picked
up at the existing Kinda Weir to serve the irrigated area of the project by
a gravity system. Between the dam and Kinda Weir, additional runoff (about
3,500 M cu ft yearly) is available from the local catchment area of about 77
sq mi. This additional runoff would be regulated by the proposed power re-
regulating dam at Kinda Weir, thus bringing the average total project water
supply for irrigation to about 51,500 M cu ft annually. The above run-off
data, which are critical to the project planning and design, have been
thoroughly reviewed and found to be adequately reliable.
5.29      Demand.  Using 1950-77 month-wise data, irrigation demand was esti-
mated with computerization based on the following assumptions: (a) overall
efficiency of about 40% 1/ for paddy and 45-50% 1/ for other crops (45% for
areas C, D, E, and F and 50% for area A), (b) effective rainfall of about 70-
75% of actual monthly rainfall for paddy and 60-65% for other crops, depending
on actual rainfall intensity. Based on the modified Pennman method, the
estimated annual total demand for irrigation would average about 47,000 M cu
ft (1,340 M m ), compared with the available average total project water sup-
ply of about 51,500 M cu ft. For extremely draught years (e.g., 1960), the
estimated annual total demand for irrigation would average about 53,800 M cu
ft (Annex 1, Tables 5-7). The detailed reservoir operation studies indicate
that the reservoir storage would be sufficient to meet irrigation and power
requirements nearly every year, except in the extremely draught years when
deficit of water would occur during April-May for paddy and upland crops.
This shortage frequency level is acceptable.
5.30      Water Quality.  The overall quality of the water supply to be used
for irrigation is good. The water of the Panlaung River is excellent with
very low salt content (200 ppm) and has been used in the existing service
area over the years without the development of salinity or alkalinity problems.
No problems are anticipated in the new area development. Drains would be con-
structed where needed in the new areas, and drainage improvements would be
made in the currently irrigated area to provide desired control of groundwater
levels.
5.31      Water Rights.  In Burma, all water and land belong to GOB; therefore,
there is no likelihood of water extraction upstream. The return flow from the
1/   Based on field efficiency of 85% for paddy and 65% for other crops,
conveyance efficiency of 70% for areas C, D, E, F, and 75% for A,
and the percolation losses of 0.1 in (2.5 mm) per day.



- 30 -
service areas would be enough to maintain the minimum downstream flow require-
ments of the river towards the main Irrawaddy River, 96 mi below the main
diversion at Kinda Weir.
Environmental Effects
5.32      In Burma there is no schistosomiasis or other similar diseases that
are common in some tropical regions of the world. The only known water-related
disease in the area is malaria. At one time, malaria was practically eliminated,
but in recent years the incidence of the disease has been increasing. This
has been due to a variety of factors, including the evolution of mosquitoes
resistant to DDT and a general slackening of control measures because of inade-
quate staffing and budgeting. The project works are not expected to aggravate
the existing conditions of this malady. Special anti-malarial measures would
be provided under the project at all construction camp sites within the project
area.
5.33      Existing fisheries in the area are negligible, and the project would
have little adverse effect on them. The reservoir would have the potential to
become an important area for fish production if planned pilot fish hatcheries
along the river are developed. Investigations for possible development of
fisheries in the reservoir are proposed by the Fisheries Department of GOB
under its normal program.
5.34      Reduced flooding and improved drainage would improve environmental
and public health conditions in the project area. An intensified extension
program through education and training would stress proper application of
pesticides. The effects of pesticides, however, would be evaluated by a short-
term consultant to be provided under the project and attached to AC. In addi-
tion, the laboratory provided through the project would provide facilities
for testing water and soil samples to monitor the use and effect of pesticides.
Power System Planning and Operations Review
5.35      Although a full power appraisal has not been carried out, it is
clear that several aspects of EPC's operations require immediate attention.
A program to improve some of EPC's planning and operations function would
include:
(a) Assessment of hydro projects to follow Paunglaung based
on available relevant information;
(b) Review and extension of the current power investment plan
from 10 years to about 15 years. The revised investment
plan would include the necessary generating and trans-
mission facilities appropriately timed to meet the load
growth at the minimum cost;
(c) A system-wide operating strategy including protective
relaying, fault separation, and load dispatching schemes;
and
(d) Measures to reduce losses in distribution systems.



- 31 -
Assurances were obtained to ensure that GOB would prepare and submit to IDA
this power system planning and operations review by April 1981.
5.36      To utilize fully the off-peak energy from the Lawpita station at
present and also from the proposed Nyaunggyat plant in future, it is essential
that the operation of the Kyunchaung plant be integrated into the hydrogrid
system. Assurances were obtained from GOB that required actions to utilize
fully the output of the Nyaunggyat plant would be undertaken prior to the
commissioning of the plant. These actions would include: (a) integration of
the Kyunchaung gas turbine with the hydro-grid system to facilitate efficiency
throughout the system; (b) installation of additional transformers at the
Mandalay and Thazi substations; (c) upgrading of the transmission voltage for
the Thazi-Toungoo line from the currently planned 132 kV to 230 kV; and (d)
installation of additional transformer at the Toungoo substation.
VI. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Project Cost Estimates
6.01      Total project costs over the six-year implementation period (July
1980 to June 1986) are estimated at US$235 M equivalent (K 1,574.6 M). The
foreign exchange component is estimated at US$158.0 M equivalent (K 1,058.6 M),
or about 67% of the total project costs. Local costs, estimated at US$77.0 M
equivalent (K 516.0 M), include about US$13 M equivalent (K 87.1 M) for taxes
and duties on imported equipment and materials. 1/ Cost estimates are based
on detailed designs and quantities for ICB civil works and force account works,
with prices adjusted to expected March 1980 price levels. Unit prices for
imported equipment, vehicles, and foreign consultants are based on recent con-
tract awards and international prices. Costs of ICB civil works for construc-
tion of the dam, powerhouse, and allied structures are based on contractors'
estimates. Costs of force account civil works for irrigation facilities,
flood control and drainage, land clearing, workshops and other buildings, and
erection of the transmission line are based on recent costs for similar works
in Burma. Physical contingencies are estimated at: (a) 15% for ICB civil
works for the dam, powerhouse, and allied structures; (b) 15% for force account
works of irrigation facilities, flood control, and drainage for Areas A, C, D,
and E, and 20% for Area F; (c) 15% for the access road; and (d) 5% on equip-
ment for all the project components. Price contingencies have been estimated,
based on the latest Bank price escalation projections (January '80), as follows:
Annual Inflation Rate (%)
1980   1981    1982   1983-85  1986
Foreign Costs      10.5    9.0      8.0      7.0    6.0
Local Costs         7.0    7.0      7.0      7.0    6.0
1/   Taxes and duties on ICB civil werks exempted.



- 32 -
In addition, the estimate provides for a risk allowance contingency at about
8% (about US$6.0 M, including about US$3.3 M in foreign exchange) of the cost
of ICB civil works for the dam, powerhouse and allied structures to allow
for possible country risks, since this will be the first venture involving
International competitive bidding for civil works construction in Burma.
6.02      Main components in the cost estimates are the dam and allied
structures (US$101.5 M); power component (US$63.0 M); irrigation, drainage,
and flood control (US$55.0 M); agricultural support (US$4.2 M); and farm
power support (US$2.4 M). Estimated component-wise costs, including costs
of engineering and administration, technical assistance, and physical and
price contingencies, detailed in Annex 2, Table 1, are summarized below:

civil works (US$0.5 M); and engineering and administration (US$9.0 M), total-
ling to a base project cost of US$163.1 M. Physical contingencies (US$16.0 M),
risk allowance contingency (US$6.0 M), price contingencies (US$41.0 M), de-
tailed engineering for the Paunglaung project and Power System Planning and
Operations review (US$7.2 M), and pilot groundwater scheme (US$1.7 M) bring
the total estimated project cost to US$235.0 M. Estimated project costs for
the various elements are detailed in Annex 2, Table 2.
Financing
6.04      With assistance from the Bank Group, GOB is tentatively making
arrangements for financing part of the foreign exchange cost (about US$66.4 M
equivalent) from bilateral sources:

bution of US$90.0 M would finance about US$156.4 M equivalent or about 70% of
the total project costs net of taxes and duties, which is US$1.6 M below that
required for total financing of estimated foreign exchange costs (US$158.0 M).
The Government of Burma would finance about US$78.6 million equivalent includ-
ing about US$1.6 million of the foreign exchange costs (for equipment reserved
for procurement under local procedures). A condition of effectiveness for the
IDA Credit would be the satisfactory arrangements for commitments from co-
financiers participating in project financing.
Procurement
6.06      Equipment and Vehicles.  The procurement of mechanical and electrical
equipment to be installed in the powerhouse, switchyard and Thazi substation;
and the supply of transmission line materials (steel towers, conductors, insu-
lators, etc.) would be covered under KfW assistance (para 6.04) and procured
under kfW procurement guidelines. Equipment, vehicles, and spares for force
account works supplied under Japanese assistance would be procured in accordance
with Japan procurement guidelines. Equipment financed by IDA would be pro-
cured by ICB in accordance with IDA guidelines. Equipment, spare parts, and
materials, and groupings thereof, estimated to cost the equivalent of or less
than US$100,000, which are either required urgently or are not suitable for
international tendering, may be procured through prudent shopping (on the
basis of comparing prices from no less than three independent suppliers) by
normal GOB procurement procedures. Such purchases would be limited to a maxi-
mum of US$1.0 M. Because access road completion is critical to timely and
effective execution of the project, essential equipment for road construction



- 34 -
may be procured after comparing prices from not less than three independent
suppliers in accordance with procurement procedures of the Borrower accept-
able to IDA. Such procurement shall not exceed the equivalent of US$1.0 M.
Tractors, power tillers, other equipment, and field vehicles with an estimated
foreign exchange cost of about US$1.6 M (including contingencies) would be
reserved for procurement under local procedures and would not be eligible for
reimbursement out of the proceeds of the IDA Credit.
6.07      Civil Works.  The major civil works contract (about US$70.0 M) for
construction of the dam, powerhouse, and allied structures, including furnish-
ing and installation of spillway gates and irrigation outlet, would be tendered
for ICB in accordance with IDA guidelines. Necessary steps have been taken by
GOB for prequalifying bidders for ICB works. The bidding documents for the ICB
contract have been prepared and reviewed by IDA and the ID/EPC engineers. The
Government is in the process of approving these documents and the bidding
procedures and the contract is expected to be signed by late 1980. Procure-
ment of construction equipment, materials and supplies, vehicles, and spares
related to construction of the dam, powerhouse, and allied structures under
the ICB contract (para 7.15) would be the responsibility of the ICB contractor.
6.08      Civil works (about US$25.8 M) for irrigation facilities, flood
control and drainage, land clearing, workshops, agricultural godowns, and
training dormitories would not be suitable for ICB. Since these works would
comprise a number of small, simple, scattered works involving earthwork, land
clearing, minor structures, and small buildings, they are unlikely to interest
foreign contractors. Also, construction would be subject to seasonal interrup-
tions from weather and would have to be phased to minimize interruptions to
agriculture. No private contracting industry exists in Burma. ID, AC, and AMD
would, therefore, carry out these works by force account (para 7.16) for which
these agencies are generally well-experienced.
6.09      Transmission Line.  For construction of the 132 kV transmission line,
supply of all materials (steel towers, conductors, insulators, etc.) would be
made under KfW assistance (paras 6.04 and 6.06). EPC would erect the trans-
mission line by force account and carry out final testing of the power plant
under the supervision of consultants (para 7.16). EPC has had wide experience
in erecting transmission lines since 1968.
Disbursements
6.10      Disbursements from the proposed IDA Credit would be made for:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for construction of the dam,
and allied structures under the ICB contract, including
furnishing and installation of spillway gates and irriga-
tion outlet (other than those ICB works financed by
German assistance);
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures (cif) and 100% of local expendi-
tures (ex-factory cost) for equipment, spare parts, and con-
struction materials (other than those financed by Germany and
Japan);



- 35 -
(c)  80% of local expenditures for other equipment and spare parts
procured locally through prudent shopping for force account
work;
(d)  100% of foreign expenditures for consulting services (other
than those financed by Norway and Germany); and
(e)  100% of total expenditures for overseas training (other
than those financed by Germany).
6.11      Disbursements against all items would be fully documented.  During
implementation, the disbursement percentages and categories would be reviewed
by IDA from time to time and amended as necessary. The Director of the
Nyaunggyat Project (DNP) (para 7.12) would be responsible for preparing dis-
bursement claims and submitting these to IDA.
6.12      To ensure expeditious completion of the access road by force account
(para 5.11), retroactive financing of up to US$1.5 M is recommended to cover
foreign costs for eligible project expenditures on equipment and materials
incurred from January 1, 1980 up to the date of Credit signing.
6.13      It is expected that disbursements would be completed by June 30,
1987, about one year following completion of project implementation. An
estimated semiannual schedule of disbursements is given below:
Disbursements (IDA Credit)
US$ Million Equivalent
IDA Fiscal Year    1st Semester   2nd Semester  Total   Cumulative
FY81                 1.5             5.0          6.5        6.5
FY82                 6.0             8.5         14.5       21.0
FY83                 7.0            10.0         17.0       38.0
FY84                 7.5            10.5         18.0       56.0
FY85                 8.0            11.5         19.5       75.5
FY86                 7.5              7.0        14.5       90.0
Accounts and Audits
6.14      All GOB agencies, including ID, AC, AMD, and EPC, maintain accounts
according to procedures and forms established by the Ministry of Planning and
Finance (MPF). The Central Audit and Inspection Office, acting on behalf of
the Council of People's Inspectors, is responsible for auditing GOB agency
accounts and would be acceptable to IDA as an independent auditor for this
project.  Assurances were obtained from GOB that:
(a)  separate accounts for each project component would be main-
tained by the respective implementing agencies including
the EPC, and collated by the Project Implementation Com-
mittee (PIC);



- 36 -
(b) these accounts would be audited annually in accordance with
sound auditing principles consistently applied by the
Director General, Central Accounts Office, acting on behalf
of the Council of the People's Inspectors of GOB; and
(c) PIC would send to IDA copies of the summary of an unaudited
annual project accounts within four months of the end of the
fiscal year, to be followed by certified copies of the audited
account and auditor's report within nine months of the end of
each fiscal year.
VII. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Implementation Responsibility
7.01      The Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MAF) would be responsible
for the implementation of the project. The overall organization of this
ministry is presented in Annex 4, Chart 4. MAF is currently implementing the
Irrigation I Project (Cr. 483-BA); Lower Burma Paddyland Development I Project
(Cr. 642-BA), Seeds Development Project (Cr. 745-BA); Paddyland Development II
Project (Cr. 835-BA); Forestry Project (Cr 493-BA); and Livestock Project
(Cr. 597-BA).
7.02      The various components of the proposed Nyaunggyat project would be
implemented by existing GOB agencies and departments normally concerned with
those activities. Altogether there would be four agencies directly respon-
sible for project implementation, three under MAF and one under the Ministry
of Industries II (MI-2) as detailed below:
GOB Agency                                Ministry
(a)  Irrigation Department (ID)                           MAF
(b)  Agriculture Corporation (AC)                         MAF
(c)  Agricultural Mechanization Department (AMD)          MAF
(d)  Electric Power Corporation (EPC)                     MI-2
In addition, the Planning and Statistics Department (PSD) and the Settlement
and Land Records Department (SLRD), both within MAF, and the Ministry of Plan-
ning and Finance would be directly involved with implementing agencies in proj-
ect coordination and management, while the Survey Department (SD), Cooperative
Department (CD), Agriculture and Farm Products Trade Corporation (AFPTC),
and Myanma Agricultural Bank (MAB) would be indirectly involved with project
implementation.
7.03      The Irrigation Department (ID) would be responsible for:  (a) super-
vising construction of the dam, and allied structures under ICB cQntract; (b)
rehabilitation of existing irrigation works; (c) construction of new irrigation



- 37 -
facilities; (d) construction of flood control works, drainage improvements,
and canal roads; (e) on-farm development and water management; (f) construc-
tion of the access road, O&M buildings, and camp sites; and (g) procurement
of construction equipment and materials for force account works. ID would
organize eight units for executing the project including six units for force
account works (three for civil construction; two for mechanical engineering,
and one for planning and design); and two units for ICB civil works (one for
dam construction and one for testing and quality control). Each unit would
be headed by an ID executive engineer (Annex 4, Chart 2). All the units would
be supervised by two ID superintending engineers under the direct control of
the Director of the Nyaunggyat Project (para 7.12).
7.04      ID has been the pioneer agency in the field of water resources dev-
elopment in Burma. In the past, its responsibilities have included planning,
design, construction, and O&M of both single and multipurpose projects. ID's
current program includes several irrigation and drainage projects. Its per-
manent professional staff is well-qualified to carry out the program success-
fully. However, its operations often suffer from: (a) delays in GOB approval
of additional project staffing, and (b) shortage of adequate equipment, vehic-
les, and spare parts. With the necessary equipment and vehicles to be pro-
vided under the project, ID staff should have no problem implementing the
force account project civil works, provided required additional staffing
is approved expeditiously by GOB.
7.05      The Agriculture Corporation (AC) would be responsible for (a)
strengthening extension services; (b) establishing a cotton research and demon-
stration farm in the newly irrigated area; and (c) constructing input godowns,
staff quarters, dormitories, and farm buildings. AC would provide research
support, implement the intensified extension program, and supply seeds, fer-
tilizers, and other inputs to project farmers. AC would appoint a Project
Extension Manager (PEM), with the grade of AC Deputy General Manager, who
would be headquartered at Myittha and would be responsible for implementation
and coordination of the T&V extension program in the entire four-township
administrative area. Currently, however, each township has a Township Exten-
sion Manager (TEM) who has varied functions (extension, supplies and services,
and other miscellaneous jobs). Therefore, agricultural extension personnel
under the TEM would be divided into two groups: one strictly for the T&V
extension program and one for supplies, services, and miscellaneous jobs;
each group would be under a separate Deputy Township Extension Manager (DTEM).
For the T&V program, which includes field scouting of cotton pests, the DTEM
would supervise the work of 4-5 Village Tract Extension Managers (VTEMs) each
in charge of about 6-7 Village Extension Managers (VEMs). Each VEM would be
responsible for about 350 farm families. The PEM would be assisted by four
Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs) for cotton, paddy, plant protection, and
on-farm water management, all to be stationed at Myittha.
7.06      Present levels of supporting services throughout Burma would be in-
adequate for intensive agricultural development, and GOB must begin improving
services and increasing input supplies in areas designated for intensive dev-
elopment, such as the project area. Assurances were obtained from GOB that:



- 38 -
(a) the organizational set-up and work program for the agricul-
tural extension services for the project would be satis-
factory to IDA;
(b) fertilizers would be supplied for all paddy and cotton
varieties, and for all crops in the project area at rates
to be recommended each year by the extension service; and
(c) each AC Township Supplies and Service Office would stock
sufficient sprayers and pesticides in the project area on
the basis of estimates to be made annually by the exten-
sion service.
7.07      The Agricultural Mechanization Department (AND) would be responsible
for (a) land clearing and levelling in the new development areas; (b) con-
structing staff quarters, tractor sheds, and workshops; (c) providing tractor
services to farmers; and (d) maintaining farm machinery.
7.08      The Electric Power Corporation (EPC) would be responsible for (a)
supervising construction of the powerhouse and allied structures and instal-
lation of equipment; and (b) erecting the 132 kV transmission line. The Man-
aging Director of EPC, under the direction of MI-2, is responsible for the
overall management of the Corporation. He is appointed by the Council of State
on recommendation of the Cabinet and the Chairman of the Management Board of
EPC. This board consists of seven members (including the Chairman) who assist
the Managing Director. The detailed organization chart of EPC is shown in
Annex 4, Chart 5. EPC would mobilize four additional units for the project--
to supervise powerhouse construction, equipment installation including exten-
sion of the Thazi substation, and to construct the 132 kV transmission line.
Each unit would be headed by an EPC executive engineer. These units would
be under the direct control of the Superintending Engineer (EPC) for the
powerhouse and transmission lines (Annex 4, Chart 2).
7.09      EPC has had wide experience since 1968 in constructing transmission
lines. EPC completed the 132 kV Thazi-Chauk line (90 mi) in 1969 and the addi-
tion of one circuit (70 mi) to the 132 kV Lawpita-Thazi line (under energized
condition) in 1975 by force account. The 66 kV transmission line, recently
completed from Myanaung to Myaungmya (160 mi), was also erected by force
account. Based on past performance, EPC has the capability of constructing
the project transmission line by force account, provided required additional
project staff is approved by GOB.
Project Management and Coordination
7.10      To coordinate the work of the various implementing agencies, a
Project Implementation Committee (PIC) would be formed in MAF similar to
the PICs for the Lower Burma Paddyland Development Projects I and II. The
proposed Nyaunggyat project however, involves complex components and multiple-
agencies, and successful implementation would depend heavily upon the capabil-
ity for quick resolution of policy issues and bottlenecks encountered during
implementation. PIC, chaired by the Deputy Minister of MAF would, therefore,
be limited to only representatives of those agencies directly involved in



- 39 -
project implementation, with due representation of EPC. Representatives of
other related agencies would be associate members to be called by the chairman
as needed. The proposed PIC organization is presented in Annex 4, Chart 2.
7.11      PIC would be responsible for resolution of inter-ministerial project-
related policy issues and implementation bottlenecks as well as for other
important administrative matters. PIC would be responsible for: (a) reviewing
and approving annual work programs and budgets; (b) reviewing quarterly
progress reports; and (c) conferring with IDA on all major project-related
policy matters.
7.12      A competent senior ID officer within MAF would be appointed Director
of the Nyaunggyat Project (DNP) and would serve concurrently as member-secretary
of PIC. He would be responsible for coordinating technical planning and field
execution of the project's various components. The DNP would be assisted by
three superintending engineers, two from ID for dam and allied structures
construction under ICB contract and the other for irrigation and agricultural
development works by force account, and one from EPC for the power plant and
transmission lines (Annex 4, Chart 2). DNP's responsibilities would include:
(a) preparation of annual work programs and budgets in col-
laboration with the various implementing agencies;
(b) coordinate the release of funds and payments for project
expenditures by the respective agencies;
(c) coordinate the preparation and maintenance of consolidated
project accounts;
(d) coordinate in the preparation of claims for reimbursement
from the proposed financing package;
(e) monthly progress review with each implementing agency;
(f) resolution of implementation bottlenecks; and
(g) conferring with PIC on all project matters.
7.13      The proposed Nyaunggyat project would require establishment of three
additional circles, each headed by a superintending engineer, and 11 additional
units 8 for ID (para 7.03) and 3 for EPC (para 7.08)). GOB has approved the
three additional circles and has appointed the three (2 ID, and 1 EPC) Superin-
tending Engineers. GOB has also appointed a full-time Director for Nyaunggyat
Project and has established the PIC. Assurances were obainted from GOB that
required additional staff for ID, AC, and EPC for project implementation would
be approved and appointed not later than October 31, 1980 in accordance with
the agreed schedule with IDA.
7.14      Coordination of land allotments and/or redistribution in the project
area would be carried out by the township councils, which are responsible for
civil administration and land allocation. Each township would have a Township



- 40 -
Project Committee (TPC) to coordinate land allotments, extension activities,
and construction. Each TPC would include the township-level officers of the
implementing agencies as members, the ID Executive Engineer as chairman, and
the AC township-level manager as member-secretary. After the completion of
project construction, the AC Township Manager would serve as chairman, with one
other member of the Committee serving as secretary. TPCs would be established
before construction and land reclamation begin in the respective townships.
ICB and Force Account Works
7.15      ICB Works.  The principal feature of this multipurpose project would
be the construction of major structures including the dam, dikes, spillway,
powerhouse, and allied structures. Timely, efficient, and proper construction
of these specialized structures would demand the services of an experienced
contractor (a foreign contractor since there are no contractors in Burma).
It was agreed between GOB and IDA that the construction of the dam, power
plant, and appurtenant structures would be undertaken by ICB contract in
accordance with the IDA's normal procedures.
7.16      Force Account Works.  The following works would be implemented by
ID through force account: (a) rehabilitation of existing irrigation works;
(b) construction of new irrigation facilities; (c) construction of flood
control works and drainage improvements; (d) on-farm development and water
management; and (e) construction of the access road, canal roads, campsites,
and O&M buildings. Staff quarters, input godowns, dormitories, and farm
buildings would be constructed by AC; staff quarters, tractor sheds, and
workshops by AMD; and the 132 kV transmission line by EPC.
7.17      All implementing agencies are generally well-experienced with the
type of work included in the project and have been involved in the past with
similar, successfully completed works. With additional staffing and technical
assistance to be provided under the project (para 5.26), all agencies are
expected to be fully capable of implementing their respective components.
Engineering and Designs
7.18      Feasibility designs and estimates for the dam, powerhouse, and
allied structures were made by LI, who have done extensive work in other
countries of Southeast Asia. Preliminary designs and estimates were made by
LI in their feasibility report of November 1978, which were suitably modified
in April-May 1979 based on additional information on foundation geology and
construction materials. LI is also currently preparing detailed designs
and specifications for ICB bidding documents for construction of the dam,
powerhouse, and allied structures.
7.19      The layout and design of irrigation works to be constructed by force
account have been prepared by ID. ID's civil works designs and estimates for
the project have been based on plan and profile drawings of the main canals
taken from field surveys of the entire project service area, aerial photographs,
and complete surveys of project areas, except Area F. Sample areas were used
to compute work quantities for minor canals, watercourses, and drains for the



- 41 -
proposed newly irrigated areas. Preliminary designs and estimates were com-
pleted for each major structure including syphons, aquaducts, bridges, falls,
escapes, canal linings and flood embankments. ID has had considerable experi-
ence in planning, designing, and constructing these kinds of engineering
works.
Implementation Schedule
7.20      Overall project implementation would take six years (Annex 4, Chart 1).
However, the dam, powerhouse, and allied structures are expected to be com-
pleted by the end of the fifth year. Site surveys for most buildings for the
project are already underway, and construction of these buildings should be
completed in about two years. Tender documents for construction and other
equipment for works by force account have been prepared, and the contracts
are expected to be awarded by July 1980 with site deliveries in late-1980.
Staff mobilization is expected to begin by mid-1980.
7.21      The preliminary works related to construction of the dam, powerhouse,
and allied structures under the ICB civil works contract and much of the sup-
porting infrastructure for agricultural development provided through force
account would be completed within two years of the project's start. Emphasis
in the remaining years would be on rehabilitating irrigation works, construct-
ing irrigation facilities for new areas, introducing irrigation water manage-
ment, intensifying agricultural development, and completing the dam, power-
house, allied structures, and transmission line.
7.22      By the end of September of each year, DNP in collaboration with the
various implementing agencies, would prepare a detailed work program for the
following calendar year, including associated budgetary requirements. This
program would be supported by appropriate maps, charts, and diagrams and would
include estimated manpower and material requirements. Following a review by
PIC, the work program would be submitted to IDA for comments. Assurances were
obtained from GOB that by October 31 of each year, IDA would receive for com-
ment the detailed work program for the following calendar year.
Monitoring and Evaluation
7.23      The project's progress would be reported monthly to DNP by the
staff of the various implementing agencies. To avoid burdening field staff
with excessive paperwork, monthly progress reports should be brief and include
only data of key importance. DNP would then consolidate these individual
reports into quarterly reports for review and discussion by PIC. Formats for
these quarterly reports would be worked out jointly by DNP and the concerned
agencies with assistance from IDA. Quarterly reports, together with other
relevant project records, would be used to prepare a comprehensive annual
progress report. Assurances were obtained from GOB that quarterly progress
reports would be submitted to IDA within one month of the end of the quarter
under review and that annual progress reports would be sent to IDA by March 31
of the following year.



- 42 -
7.24      To aid MAF in the agricultural development of the project area and
to provide a basis for the future evaluation of the project, a monitoring pro-
gram would be undertaken.  Township councils routinely maintain records from
which much of the pertinent information could be compiled. However, agricul-
tural surveys would be required to supplement this information and to provide
a consistent data base for monitoring agricultural development. An assurance
was obtained from GOB that PIC would establish a project monitoring unit to
conduct benchmark surveys every two years beginning January 1981, covering,
inter alia, cropped areas, yields, use of farm inputs, and project-related
changes in area employment opportunities and in farm and family incomes. An
assurance was also obtained from GOB that it would maintain records and proce-
dures adequate to record and monitor the progress of the project (including
costs and benefits), and furnish to IDA at regular intervals all such inform-
ation as IDA shall reasonably request concerning the project, its cost, and
benefits derived.
Operation and Maintenance
7.25      The installation of project works, including the dam, allied struc-
tures, irrigation facilities, flood embankments, and drains, and the addition
of about 113,500 ac of service area would greatly expand O&M activities in the
Panlaung River irrigation system. The system is currently managed by one main-
tenance engineer with four sub-assistants supervising four sub-areas and one
sub-assistant for special duty. For current operations and water distribution,
there are two canal inspectors, four assistants, and supporting staff. Mainte-
nance is accomplished primarily by hand labor supplemented by heavy mainte-
nance equipment stationed at ID base workshops. Estimates of incremental O&M
buildings and staff are provided in Annex 2(c), Table 9. Provision is made
under the project to meet these needs to ensure proper O&M.
7.26      The dam, allied structures, re-regulating dam, irrigation facili-
ties, campsites, and residential quarters for ID construction and maintenance
units would be maintained by ID; fertilizer godowns, residential quarters for
extension staff, and training school buildings by AC; farm equipment workshops
by AMD; and the power plant and transmission lines by EPC. O&M costs during
the six-year implementation period have been included as a GOB contribution
to the project cost.
7.27      ID would also be responsible for reservoir operation in collabora-
tion with EPC based on requirements for irrigation and power generation.
Assurances were obtained from GOB that detailed regulations for reservoir
operation would be submitted to IDA by September 1983 for review and comment.
Assurances were also obtained from GOB that: (a) the dam, allied structure,
powerhouse, transmission line, and all irrigation facilities, roads, and
buildings constructed and rehabilitated under the project would be maintained
in accordance with sound engineering practices by the respective agencies
including ID, AC, AMD, and EPC; (b) adequate staff and funds would be provided
for this purpose; (c) annual budgetary allocations for the various implement-
ing agencies would be appropriately increased to provide for project-related
recurrent expenses; and (d) EPC would perform its operations, plan future
development of its power system, and maintain its financial position in accor-
dance with sound engineering, financial, and administrative practices under the



- 43 -
supervision of experienced and competent management, and that EPC would furnish
to IDA unaudited financial statements for its operation within four months of
the end of each fiscal year to be followed by certified copies of its financial
statements and audit reports within nine months of the end of each fiscal year.
Dam Safety Program
7.28      The International Commission on Large Dams, as well as all the various
dam project agencies throughout the world, are becoming increasingly concerned
about dam safety since dam failures have often involved disastrous consequences.
The Bank Group has also taken a constructive step in this regard by preparing
some useful guidelines. To ensure the safety of the proposed Nyaunggyat dam,
the project would provide for the following specific safety measures:
(a) Instrumentation. The main dam, saddle dikes, and allied
structures would be equipped with instrumentation to fore-
cast serious damage or movements by measuring strains,
settlements, internal seepage pressures, and seepage
gradients. Such instrumentation for the main dam and
dikes would principally consist of: (i) benchmarks for
geodetic control; (ii) vertical and horizontal settle-
ment gauges; (iii) soil pressure and pore water gauges;
(iv) embankment and foundation piezometers; and (v) seismo-
graphs. Three complete measuring sections from upstream
to downstream of the dam embankment, would be installed
with the above instrumentation. The proposed instrumen-
tation would provide handy tools for studying the behavior
of the dam and foundations after construction and for
timely requisite protective measures to control undesir-
able developments or emergency conditions.
(b) Advisory Panel of Experts. The proposed project would provide
for an Advisory Panel of Experts to carry out a comprehensive
review of the designs and/or completed works of the dam and
related structures with the objective of ascertaining and
reporting on their general safety and performance, with
detailed consideration of structural, geologic, hydraulic,
hydrologic, and soil mechanics aspects. The proposed
three-member panel would include: (i) a dam design expert;
(ii) a dam construction engineer; and (iii) an engineering
geologist. The panel would meet often enough for it to
ensure general safety of the dam and allied structures and
suggest safeguarding measures and/or treatments as and when
necessary during various stages of dam construction, con-
struction designs refinement, and safety inspections of the
dam. Assurances were obtained from GOB that the members of
the Advisory Panel of Experts for dam safety would be appointed
by GOB on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, prior to the
award of the ICB civil works contract.
Resettlement
7.29      Project works would necessitate almost negligible relocation of
persons from affected areas. The construction of the Nyaunggyat dam would



- 44 -
entail the flooding of four villages (Neyaunggar, Nyaunggyat, Taungbon, and
Patchaung) in the reservoir area having a total population of about 400 and
including about 650 ac of rainfed cultivable land. The project would provide
for the resettlement of these people including compensation for loss of immov-
able private property and communal property (pagodas and monasteries), trans-
port for movable private property, and subsistence allowance for about six
months (Annex 2(a), Table 1). The project would include development and
irrigation of about 11,000 ac of bush land in the dryland tract onto which
this small number of dislocated people could be re-established. At these
sites, affected families would have greater income potential and would be
provided health care and other amenities considerably better than in their
present malarial environment. Assurances were obtained from GOB that a
resettlement program, including adequate compensation, would be carried out
for persons affected by dam construction in accordance with a resettlement
plan acceptable to IDA.
VIII. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, FARM INCOMES, AND COST RECOVERY
Cropping Patterns
8.01      The project would improve agricultural production on 88,000 ac which
are currently irrigated and on 113,500 ac of rainfed area to be brought under
irrigation. Approximately 11,000 ac of this rainfed area is bush land that
would be developed with the project. In terms of land categories (para 2.04),
this would comprise 84,400 ac of paddyland and 110,300 ac of ya land. Through
provision of year-round irrigation, the project would enable development of
two distinct cropping patterns: one for paddyland emphasizing paddy cultiva-
tion with basin irrigation, and one for ya land based on medium-staple cotton
production with furrow irrigation.
8.02      Paddyland Cropping Pattern.  The 84,400 ac of paddyland (68,000 ac
in the rehabilitation area and 16,400 ac in the newly irrigated area) would
have paddy as the dominant crop. It is expected that with the development of
medium-staple cotton on the newly irrigated ya land, it would no longer be
necessary for GOB to require cultivation of pre-monsoon cotton on 30% of irri-
gated paddyland, which lacks proper drainage. This, together with an assured
year-round supply of irrigation water, would enable farmers to increase area
under HYV paddy for both pre-monsoon and monsoon crops. Accordingly, cotton
would disappear from paddyland, and cropped area under paddy would increase
from about 52,000 to 107,000 ac, while the area under residual crops would
remain basically unchanged. With the project, cropping intensity would in-
crease on average from about 123% to 167% as shown below (Annex 1, Table 8):

8.03      Ya Land Cropping Pattern.  Of the 110,300 ac of ya land, 20,000
ac of currently irrigated land would be rehabilitated and 90,300 ac would
be newly irrigated. Since ya land is largely well-drained, introduction of
furrow irrigation would permit development of medium-staple cotton as a late
monsoon crop, complemented by other cash crops such as chillies, oilseeds,
and onions. It is expected that the area under cotton would increase from the
current 10,100 ac (3,200 ac medium-staple and 6,900 ac short-staple) to 73,700
ac (medium-staple) at full development. Area under other cash crops would
also increase from 36,300 ac to 87,100 ac. However, the area under pulses
would decrease from 27,900 to 15,500 ac. The current paddy area of about
4,600 ac would be replaced by the above crops. In general, the cropping
intensity would increase from about 75% to 160% at full development as
follows (Annex 1, Table 8):

Yields and Production
8.04      Apart from permitting more use of HYV paddy seeds and development
of the late monsoon crop of medium-staple cotton, assured year-round irri-
gation would make larger and more effective applications of chemical fertil-
izers and pesticides financially rewarding. Use of fertilizers in the area
is expected to increase from 975 tons at present to an estimated 21,675
tons--an amount consistent with good cultivation practices. Accordingly,
average yields would increase from about 0.69 tons to about 1.51 tons per ac
for paddy and from 0.19 tons to 0.68 tons per ac for cotton. Yields of
chillies, sesame, groundnut, pulses, and onions would also increase substan-
tially. Present and projected yields are presented in Table 8.3.

8.05      Estimated present and future production levels based on the above
cropping patterns and yields are summarized in Table 8.4. Projected future
with-project yields are anticipated eight years after initial provision of
project irrigation. Therefore, full development production levels would be
achieved fourteen years after implementation begins, or by 1993-94. More
details about production and phasing are presented in Annex 1, Tables 8 and
11 and Annex 3, Table 19.

Marketing and Pricing of Project Output
8.06      The project would contribute to increased surpluses for export
(rice) and save foreign exchange through import substitution (cotton). Pro-
duction increases of other crops (chillies, onions, sesame, groundnuts) would
be essentially small relative to present output nationwide and would have a
ready domestic market (paras 2.28 and 8.21).
8.07      Paddy.  GOB procures paddy from farmers through the Agriculture
and Farm Produce Trade Corporation (AFPTC) based on compulsory minimum quotas.
Since paddy is procured at about 33-50% below open market prices and about
60% below its adjusted international value, the procurement system also serves
as an agricultural taxation mechanism. Progressive in nature, the system and
its administered pricing regime decrease production incentive. Over the 1975-
79 period, AFPTC has procured an average of 2.9 M tons of paddy p.a., or about
one-third of national production. While targets and guidelines are established
in Rangoon, actual procurement quotas are fixed at township and village tract
levels. Each farmer's quota is based on sown acreage and yields as well as
his estimated surplus after allowing for family consumption, seed, labor
in-kind payments, and losses. A production estimate is made by the Settle-
ment and Land Records Department (SLRD) based on two field surveys of the
crop. Surveyors generally keep yield estimates conservative to avoid farmer
complaints (para 8.31). A farmer who does not meet his quota is subject to
sanctions, including refusal of mills to process his paddy and recently, loss
of cultivation rights (para 2.10).



- 48 -
8.08      The farmer is free to sell surplus above the quota within his town-
ship at prevailing free market prices. Sale of paddy or rice across township
boundaries is restricted, however authorities tolerate private sales of small
quantities, which are often of higher quality than rice officially distributed,
into cities and deficit areas at free market prices (para 8.07). Since the
procurement system skims off on average about 60% of marketable surplus, the
average farmer can sell the remaining surplus at considerably higher prices.
Therein lies a real incentive for the farmer to adopt HYV packages and improve
overall productivity, particularly in rice-deficit areas. In fact, nation-
wide, during the 1971-78 period (a) area sown to HYVs more than doubled;
(b) HYVs as a percent of total area sown to paddy increased from 8% to 15%;
and (c) the quantity of chemical fertilizers applied to paddy practically
trebled (para 1.07).
8.09      GOB-Controlled Paddy Pricing and Production Incentives.  The rice
sector dominates the Burmese economy, involving about 70% of all farmers,
accounting for 40% of export earnings, and contributing perhaps 75-80% of
total caloric intake. Indicative of the commodity's importance was the
establishment in 1977 of a Rice Commission, chaired by the Minister of Agri-
culture and Forests, to examine all aspects of rice production, marketing,
and incentives. Its deliberations are unusually sensitive since rice pricing
is one of the most important policy issues in Burma.
8.10      With stagnating paddy production and declining rice exports in the
early and mid-1970s GOB became increasingly aware of the need to remedy trends.
Programs designed to boost productivity are now underway or in preparatory
stages to alleviate current shortages of fertilizers, pesticides, and certified
seeds; to expand research and extension; to encourage cultivation of HYVs; to
reclaim and irrigate more land; and to increase and upgrade storage, process-
ing, and transport capacity. The principal thrust of GOB's strategy has been
on input supply incentives supplemented by organizational and technical sup-
port. To encourage yield-augmenting input use, GOB provides fertilizers and
pesticides to growers at heavily subsidized rates. Estimates of subsidy levels
range from about 15% for muriate of potash, 50% for pesticides, and 66% for
urea. With rising international prices, rigidity in controlled input price
levels would lead, of course, to higher subsidy levels (Annex 3, Table 14 and
paras 8.28 and 8.29). In addition to providing input subsidies, GOB attempts
to trim grower costs further by organizing crews of volunteer workers to assist
farmers in planting and harvesting operations. GOB's inclination toward input
support mechanisms and its reticence toward price incentives reflect a basic
sensitivity to the possible inflationary consequences that modifications to
the official procurement and distribution systems might trigger. Similarly,
implications for the state budget of paddy pricing policy adjustments are
serious concerns in Burma where government resources are scarce and develop-
ment programs require considerable expansion. In addition, even though GOB
increased the official retail rice price by 187% over the 1972-77 period, a
basic tenet of Burma's development strategy has been to keep retail prices
low, not just to meet social objectives, but also to support industrializa-
tion by keeping wage costs down.



- 49 -
8.11      Since its inception, the Rice Commission has made three recommend-
ations to GOB: (a) raise basic paddy procurement prices by 22%; (b) give
even higher rates (2-6%) for premium quality paddy/rice; and (c) adjust the
procurement system to acquire 100% of marketable surplus. To date GOB has
not moved on the first suggestion, but effective October 1977 instituted a
system of higher procurement prices (about 4%) for first grade deliveries
to AFPTC collection centers. Regarding revisions to the paddy procurement
system, GOB is currently experimenting in four townships with 100% procure-
ment of surplus with existing procurement prices. To induce deliveries beyond
traditional quotas, GOB is reportedly supplying consumer goods at subsidized
rates.
8.12      With the exception of the above-mentioned marginal adjustment for
quality paddy/rice, representing only about 15% of AFPTC's procurement intake,
GOB maintains a controlled procurement price regime unchanged since July 1974.
Government programs to increase yield-augmenting input supplies and services
are indeed useful, but paddy price revisions are particularly needed in view
of real price deterioration (1974-78) by about 45-50%. Consideration should
also be given to eventual reduction in input subsidies to limit budgetary
drain. Yet, the importance of the trade-offs between necessary higher pro-
duction and exports on the one hand, and nutrition, inflation, and domestic
resource mobilization on the other should not be minimized. To limit disrup-
tive effects, GOB must introduce future price adjustments gradually and must
strike a judicious balance between multiple, and often conflicting, socio-
economic objectives.
8.13      Rice Milling.  Most of the rice milling capacity in Burma (97%) is
in the private sector. About 25% of the private sector mills (60% of capacity)
are required by law to mill for AFPTC. The remaining installations are permit-
ted to mill farmers' paddy. GOB-regulated mills charge about K 17 per ton of
AFPTC paddy and K 49 per ton of privately-owned paddy. The former charge is
considered by millers inadequate for services rendered--failing to compensate
for the full costs of depreciation, proper O&M, and a reasonable return on
investment. Hence, most mills are old and are operating beyond their economic
life. At the village level, paddy is generally milled at home or at small
artisanal facilities. Until recently, mills have suffered from spare parts
shortages. However, in 1979 mill owners began to receive needed spare parts
at a 50% subsidy through AFPTC. Nevertheless, the milling sector is charac-
terized by generally poor maintenance, low milling output (60%), outdated tech-
nology, and disinvestment. AFPTC is currently negotiating with the People's
Republic of China, Japan, and the Asian Development Bank for assistance to the
rice milling sector. Milling capacity in and around the project area, only
about 33% utilized at present, is considered adequate to process incremental
paddy output from the project if spares are made available for maintenance
of older facilities. In addition, the region should benefit substantially
from AFPTC's effort to upgrade national capacity. To complement this nation-
wide program, the project would finance short-term consultants to investigate
project area needs and make recommendations to GOB (para 5.26).
8.14      Rice Exports.  Rice exports dwindled from 3 M tons in the late 1930s
to 183,000 tons in 1975 due to stagnant production, procurement problems, and
increasing domestic requirements. Since then, rice exports have improved,



- 50 -
reaching 646,000 tons in 1978. With a 24% drop in paddy procurement in 1978
due to both farmer dissatisfaction with more forceful procedures adopted to
acquire quotas and high prices on the extra-legal international market, rice
exports for 1979 declined to only about 305,000 tons. However, with 57% higher
procurement levels in 1979 (3.5 M tons), 1980 exports are expected to recover
and to reach about 900,000 tons by 1983. Improvement in export quality through
better processing, storage, and handling facilities should improve prospects
for exports. However, such infrastructure should be complemented with more
aggressive marketing campaigns and longer-term contracting.
8.15      Internal Rice Movements.  The major rice movements are from rice sur-
plus areas in Lower Burma to (a) rice deficit areas in Upper Burma for local
consumption and (b) the ports of Rangoon and Bassein for export. Official
movement of rice totals about 1.6 M tons of which 1.0 M tons represent internal
consumption supplies. The dry zone of Burma, in which the project is situated,
currently produces only about 15% of the national rice crop (0.9 M tons) but
consumes twice as much. Incremental rice produced under the project would
total about 76,200 tons. About 60% of this quantity, equivalent to incremental
GOB procurement, would substitute for about 49,800 tons shipped from GOB
stocks in Lower Burma. An equivalent amount would be available for export.
8.16      Cotton.  AC provides seed and other inputs to cotton growers on
cash payments; the Textile Corporation (TexCorp) under MI-1 makes purchase
advances to farmers who contract to sell cotton and arranges for cotton gin-
ning, by-product processing, marketing of baled cotton, and textile manufac-
ture. At the present time, no seasonal credit is given through MAB for cotton
cultivation. The purchase advance from TexCorp is at the rate of K 210 per
ac with a maximum of K 700 per farmer. At the time of flowering, TexCorp
surveys the farmer's field and advances this partial payment.
8.17      Compulsory Cotton Purchasing and Pricing.  TexCorp buys seed cotton
at designated buying centers at K 7 per viss (K 4,238 per ton) for medium-
staple cotton and an average of K 5 per viss (K 3,027 per ton) for short-staple
cotton. These prices represent the result of substantial price adjustments
made in 1975 and 1977 and are believed by administrators and farmers alike
to offer considerable incentive to increase productivity (para 8.24). In 1978
TexCorp purchased 19,700 tons of seed cotton, about 47% of national production.
Medium-staple cotton comprised about 66% of TexCorp's 1978 purchases, about
52% of national medium-staple production. By 1979, TexCorp had increased
procurement to 30,100 tons, or 57% of total output; medium-staple purchases
represented 57% of all procurement and 68% of total medium-staple cotton
production. Farmers are required to sell all medium-staple cotton to TexCorp
and generally dispose of about 40% of their short-staple cotton at TexCorp
buying depots. Quantities not sold to TexCorp are utilized in local artisanal
industries. Free market prices for cotton are reportedly about twice GOB-
administered levels. TexCorp gins purchased seed cotton in its own facili-
ties, bales the lint cotton, and then sends the lint to its textile mills.
Cottonseed is either allocated for AC seed sales to farmers or is crushed in
TexCorp presses; cottonseed cake is generally sent to AFPTC for export, and
oil distributed internally for industrial purposes (import substitution).



- 51 -
8.18      Cotton Processing.  Ginning facilities, while GOB-owned and operated,
currently suffer from the same kinds of problems observable in the rice mill-
ing sector--poor maintenance, antiquated technology, unserviceable capacity,
and substandard output. Nationwide, TexCorp operates 46 ginning mills, most
of which are equipped with vintage belt-driven roller gins. Equipment is to
a great extent unused for lack of spares. MI-1 proposes an ambitious rehab-
ilitation and modernization program to more than double processed output
nationwide over the 1980-83 period. GOB is currently exploring the possibi-
lity of ADB-financing for a modern ginnery capable of turning out 3,000 lbs
of lint cotton per hour, tentatively proposed for the Myittha area. The pro-
posed ginnery complex would be operating by end-1983 and would produce lint of
international standard. Projected ginning capacity in and around the project
area would be adequate to process incremental project output if the proposed
new facility is supplemented by older units properly maintained through
adequate spares. To complement MI-l's renovation program, the project would
finance short-term consultants to investigate project area needs and make
recommendations to GOB (para 5.24).
8.19      Most of the lint cotton produced in the project area is currently
shipped to the Paleik Textile Mill near Mandalay. Operational since 1972,
this modern facility does not have sufficient raw materials to run even one
full shift. In view of the low utilization of facilities, TexCorp has con-
verted its weaving section to produce a blend of 65% polyester and 35% cotton.
8.20      Import Substitution.  TexCorp estimates the 1978 national demand
for cloth at 354 M yds and supply at 181 M yds. Once a modest exporter of
cotton in the early 1960s, Burma has experienced historically declining
production and rising demand. As a consequence, while unsuccessfully trying
to stimulate production, it has been forced to import cotton yarns and lint
cotton, as well as cotton and synthetic fabrics. Domestic requirements have
increased from about 12,300 to 21,830 tons of lint cotton over the 1974-78
period, or by 15.4% p.a. As a result, Burma moved from self-reliance in raw
fibers to importing 8,025 tons, about 37% of needs, by 1978. Incremental
seed cotton produced under the project would total about 42,100 tons p.a. at
full development. GOB-purchased quantities, expected to reach about 86% of
this increment, would permit the substitution of about 12,100 tons of domestic
lint for an equivalent level of imports. Additionally, derived by-products
of oilcake, about 10,200 tons, would increase current exports (CY77: 72j400
tons); and extracted oil, about 4,000 tons, would allow reduction in imports
of substitute industrial oils (CY77: 10,000 tons).
8.21      Residual Crops.  A variety of traditional cash crops would be grown
on the remainder of cropped area under the project. Unlike with assigned
crops such as paddy and cotton, the individual grower has considerably more
flexibility about which of these residual crop alternatives to cultivate and
how to market output. For model purposes, the representative cropping patterns
in Annex 1 Table 8 would provide incremental residual production as follows:
(a) onions, 29,100 tons; (b) sesame, 6,700 tons; (c) groundnuts, 9,800 tons;
(d) chillies, 5,800 tons; and (e) pulses, 400 tons. In fact, a much wider
assortment would be grown, including peas, beans, other vegetables, wheat,
and maize. Incremental output of these commodities can easily be absorbed
through increased farm family consumption as well as in local and domestic



- 52 -
urban markets. Surplus onions, chillies, and vegetable oils from the project
area are traditionally shipped to Mandalay and Rangoon. With anticipated
growth of population (2.2% p.a.) and increase in real income (2.0-2.5% p.a.)
there would be an assured market for residual output. Should temporary,
localized gluts arise, thereby depressing farmgate prices, farmers would have
sufficient alternatives to maintain estimated farm income (paras 8.22-8.27).
Farm Income
8.22      The impact of the project on farm and family incomes was analyzed
for three different farm-size models in each irrigation-agronomic zone bene-
fiting from the project: specifically, paddyland and ya land in both the
currently irrigated tract and in the currently dryland farming zone. Because
of the relatively high productivity in the area already irrigated, farm sizes
there tend to be smaller and regional population densities greater (see
Annex 1, Table 1). For this area, therefore, representative farm sizes of 3 ac,
5 ac, and 12 ac were used. Alternatively, for the newly irrigated tract where
holdings tend to be more extensive, model farm sizes of 5 ac, 12 ac, and 27 ac
were chosen. Farm size-specific cropping patterns were developed, but for input
requirements and yields, constant returns to scale were assumed. Net farm
income levels for model farms, therefore, were considered a function of respec-
tive cropping intensity, extent of cultivation of each crop, and on-farm labor
self-sufficiency. Hired labor requirements have been estimated assuming monthly
family labor availability of 57 mandays 1/. Net farm income estimates, there-
fore, include remuneration to family labor and management. Estimates were
made for non-farm income, assuming that farm family labor can find additional
employment for 20% of its free time and can earn approximately the same wages
paid to hired workers 2/. Annex 3 Tables 8-11 present estimates of net farm
income and family income. Annex 3 Table 7 provides a summary of such esti-
mates and income per capita for each farm model. The latter table also pro-
vides information concerning the number and aggregate cultivated area of.
farms in each zone represented by the respective model farm. The following
table summarizes present and projected net farm incomes within each project
agronomic zone:

able for labor.

/a   For analysis, 27 ac farm assumed reduced to 12 ac with project (para 8.27).
8.23      A number of factors explain the large disparity in relative incre-
mental benefits from the project as well as expected absolute income disparity
within the project area. Firstly, farmers in the paddy area of the currently
irrigated tract already enjoy relatively high cropping intensity and high net
farm income relative to their dryland counterparts. These farmers would real-
ize a relatively modest increase in cropping intensity with higher output from
crops already cultivated. In contrast, farmers located in dry areas currently
contend with low intensities, low productivity (with high risk), and resulting
low income; with the project, these farmers would more than double cropping
intensities and adopt more productive irrigated crop activities. Therefore,
part of the relative divergence in project-related increases in net farm
incomes can be viewed as a catching up on the part of dry tract farmers to
income levels already reached in the currently irrigated area.
8.24      Secondly, the summary table above demonstrates the relatively large
projected difference in net farm income for paddy and cotton growers. In



- 54 -
computing farm incomes, compulsory paddy quotas were valued at the controlled
price and the balance of paddy production was valued at the local open market
price. The relatively low GOB-administered paddy price level and the progres-
siveness of the system depress the value of farm output (Annex 3, Table 1 and
paras 8.09-8.12). Even assuming a drop in the free cotton market price with
the project (Annex 3, Table 19), cotton proves more profitable than paddy.
Assuming with-project yields, input requirements, and quotas, monsoon HYV
paddy net returns total about K 320/ac, whereas medium-staple cotton provides
about K 1,800/ac (assuming total cotton output valued at procurement price
levels). If all paddy were assessed at the open market price, net returns per
ac of paddy would increase to about K 800/ac, equalling only about 44% of that
achievable with cotton on well-drained ya land. Pricing all of the representa-
tive 5 ac farmer's paddy at free market levels would boost net farm income to
about K 9,240, or about 26% above that projected with the project and with the
quota; however, the adjusted net income estimate would still be about 30%
below that anticipated for the 5 ac model cotton cultivator.
8.25      Thirdly, the cotton grower would benefit not only from high returns
per ac of cotton relative to paddy, but, as may be observed from projected
cropping patterns (paras 8.02-8.03), would have greater scope to grow comple-
mentary cash crops (chillies, onions, and sesame).
8.26      While recognizing that paddy growers' income growth would be rela-
tively constrained by low procurement prices, the progressiveness of quotas,
and relatively limited capability to augment income with lucrative cash crops,
it is felt that these farmers would still have incentives to participate in
the project. Even paddy growers in the currently irrigated tract would enjoy
14-36% boosts in family income (which adjusts for incremental non-farm income
losses with the project). As Annex 3, Table 7 shows, even the 3 ac farmer in
the currently irrigated paddyland area would achieve per capita income with
project above the IBRD-estimated national average of US$120. 1/ Farmers in
this area would earn about K 16 per incremental manday of family labor from
crop activities with the project and an estimated K 15 of family income per
incremental family manday devoted to project activities. This added income,
which is considerably above the periodically available off-farm wage of about
K 7/manday, should therefore provide incentive to participate in the project.
However, cotton growers, particularly those having above 5 ac, are anticipated
to derive family incomes well above the estimated national average. For
example, the 12 ac cotton farmer is projected to realize per capita family
income of about US$700 thus placing his family in the current top one percent
of the estimated national income distribution.
8.27      To rectify these significant income imbalances between paddy and
cotton growers, as well as those anticipated between project beneficiaries
and individuals outside the project area, it is expected that farm sizes
within the project area would be assessed and adjusted particularly in the
currently dry land scheduled to receive irrigation with the project. The
division of existing farms larger than 5 ac scheduled to adopt the proposed
cotton rotation and of those larger than 12 ac scheduled to adopt the paddy

is expected to be considered. Such land redistribution can be effected, in
accordance with standard GOB practice, by Village Land Committees through
powers conferred under the Land Nationalization Act of 1953 and Tenancy Act
of 1964. Each township currently maintains a list of families with insuffi-
cient land and landless families to whom such redistributable land could be
allocated. It is recommended that GOB distribute land eligible for realloca-
tion according to the following priorities: (a) any remaining families in
need of resettlement from the encatchment and auxiliary areas of the dam;
(b) farmers whose land is to be totally or partially occupied by project
irrigation works (the number of such families and the amount of land needed
would be determined after ID finalizes the alignments of embankments, drains,
or other works); (c) families who have not been allocated land or who would
have sub-marginal holdings with full project implementation; and (d) state
farms and cooperatives.
Agricultural Cost Recovery
8.28      Cost recovery aspects of the agricultural component (Annex 3,
Table 14) were analyzed from two perspectives. 1/ Under Case I, it was
assumed that GOB would adjust its controlled input and output prices over time
to maintain relative prices within the economy. This would entail increasing
nominal prices by the domestic rate of inflation projected to rise on average
by 7.5% p.a., 1980-90. Alternatively, under Case II, it was assumed that
given GOB's adversion historically to adjust nominal prices on inflationary
grounds, the present regime of controlled prices would remain unchanged over
the 1980-90 period (paras 1.07-1.08).
8.29      Capital and Recurrent Costs and Subsidies.  The capital costs of
project works--dam, irrigation, drainage, flood control, agricultural support,
land clearance, and O&M during implementation--would amount to about K 663 M
in present value (PV) terms. 2/ Recurrent expenses for project works O&M
would amount to about K 48 M TPV). Based on projected international prices
and GOB-controlled prices, subsidies on incremental fertilizers, pesticides,
and tractor services (paras 8.10-8.12 and Annex 3, Table 14) required for the
project would total (PV) an estimated K 216 M in Case I and K 328 in Case II.
Thus, the PV of total capital and recurrent project costs and subsidies over
the 50-year projected life of the project would equal about K 932 M (Case I)
and K 1,045 M (Case II).
8.30      Recoveries through Land Taxation.  Farmers are now obliged to pay
a fixed land tax that varies by location according to land quality and avail-
able irrigation/drainage infrastructure. Rates paid are modest, ranging
from about K 1-2 per ac in dryland areas to about K 5-7 per ac in irrigated
1/   Analyses were done in constant 1980 currency units.
2/   Eight percent p.a. discount rate assumed to represent the financial
opportunity cost of capital for GOB. US$ converted to kyats at the

zones. Anticipating standard tax reassessments by SLRD in the project area,
incremental tax revenues were conservatively estimated (Annex 3, Table 14)
at about K 0.7 M p.a. in nominal terms beginning with full development; after
deflation, these were charged toward project cost recovery. On a PV basis,
such incremental revenues over the project life would total about K 1.7 M.
8.31      Recoveries through GOB Compulsory Paddy Procurement.  The present
administration of the procurement system would tax production in the project
area directly and progressively, and incremental collections would represent
a means of project cost recovery. In theory, the system would take about 75-
80% of the paddy production increment. In practice, the amount would be
considerably less, probably about 60%, reflecting the fact that crop assessors
consistently underestimate crop yields to avoid farmer dissent. The difference
between the 1990 projected rice export price and GOB's procurement price plus
milling, handling, storage, and transport costs is a tax in paddy equivalents
amounting to US$140 (pre-monsoon) and US$131 (monsoon) per ton (Case I) 1/
(Annex 3, Table 3). Thus, the increase in GOB net procurement earnings would
amount to about K 65 M (Case I) or K 83 M (Case II) p.a. from incremental paddy
procurement (49,800 tons rice) at full development. The PV of the stream of
such implicit tax over the project life would total about K 454 M (Case I) or
K 556 M (Case II) (Annex 3, Table 13).
8.32      Recoveries through GOB Compulsory Cotton Purchases.  Incremental
cotton produced under the project would serve as an import substitute, and
cotton procured through GOB's compulsory purchase system would be a source of
cost recovery for the project. Similarly, cottonseed oil derived from the
incremental compulsory purchases would substitute for imported industrial oils
and cottonseed cake obtained could increase current exports of oilseed cake;
the latter would therefore provide two more, but relatively minor, sources of
cost recovery. While GOB purchasing centers represent the only legal selling
channel for medium-staple cotton, GOB cotton purchases have been considerably
below production levels to date (para 8.17). However, with the strengthening
of GOB's purchasing infrastructure and the geographical concentration of pro-
ject cotton production, GOB is expected to purchase at least 86% of incremental
medium-staple production derived from the project. The difference between the
1990 projected border-based seed cotton price and GOB's purchasing price for
seed cotton plus ginning, handling, storage, and transport adjustments is a tax
amounting to an estimated US$285 (medium-staple) and US$288 (short-staple) per
ton of seed cotton (Case I) 2/ (Annex 3, Tables 4 and 5). Thus, the increase
in GOB's net procurement earnings would amount to about K 69 M p.a. (Case I)
or K 144 M p.a. (Case II) from incremental purchases (36,200 tons) at full
development. The PV of such implicit tax over the project life would total
about K 482 M (Case I) or K 995 M (Case II) (Annex 3, Table 13).
1/   Case II equivalents:  US$171 (pre-monsoon) and US$162 (monsoon).
2/   Case II equivalents:  US$592 (medium-staple) and US$508 (short-staple).

Under both cases, full incremental costs would be adequately covered princi-
pally through implicit commodity taxation. Actual project recovery would
fall between these two bounds, implying that the cost recovery ratio would
exceed 100%. This analysis demonstrates, moreover, that were GOB to increase
controlled output prices, these measures would initially have a negative
effect on the budget. However, were production sufficiently price-elastic,
procurement and exports (import substitution) could rise to more than offset
initial losses.
8.34      Assurances were obtained from GOB that it would provide periodic
review and, if necessary, revision of its paddy and seed cotton pricing systems
to guarantee that farmers in the project area have adequate financial incentive
to make the investments necessary to increase production; and in the event that
the existing compulsory paddy procurement system and/or compulsory cotton sales
program are (is) modified or abolished, GOB would establish and maintain
arrangements in consultation with IDA for the recovery of the capital and
O&M costs for the agricultural component of the project.
Financial Aspects of Power
8.35      To be able to achieve reasonable cost recovery through EPC's tariff
for the capital investments in the power component, these investments 2/
should be made part of EPC's own assets. This assumes that EPC should in due
course be allowed to set tariffs so as to cover all operating expenses and to
earn a reasonable return on its rate base. Assurances therefore, were obtained
from GOB that the investments in the power component would be owned by EPC.
1/   With existing procurement price regimes, this estimate is considered
a lower bound since reduced GOB rice shipments from Lower Burma greater
than incremental quotas collected in the project area would also serve
for cost recovery. A similar case applies for cotton if GOB-controlled
imports fall as a result of goods manufacture and supply from seed cotton
withheld from TexCorp buying depots.
2/   As defined in Annex 2(b), Table 1.



- 58 -
8.36      Electricity Tariff.  Present tariffs, which average about 23 pyas
(US43.4) per kWh, have been in effect since October 1, 1976. Three different
tariff schedules are applied by geographical area: (a) Rangoon; (b) Pegu,
Tharrawaddy, Prome, and Loikaw; and (c) other areas, The tariff structure is
based on the block system, with kWh charges declining with increasing use.
Even for industrial consumers, a demand charge system does not exist. Present
tariff schedules are shown in Annex 3, Table 15. While general purpose rates
average a reasonable 42.5 pyas (USe 6.3) per kWh, rates for industrial use are
low, averaging 12.8 pyas (US4 1.9) per kWh. The share of industrial sales in
total sales is about 57%, but due to the low industrial rate, the industrial
revenue share is only 32%.
8.37      A modest tariff increase of about 14.5%, to be accomplished by
reducing the number of blocks and thereby primarily increasing industrial
rates, was proposed by EPC to MI-2 in February 1979. Assurances were obtained
from GOB that the proposed tariff increase of about 14.5% would be implemented
during FY 1980/81. Based on EPC's forecast of its financial position, it
appears that for EPC to achieve reasonable operating results, tariffs should be
further increased. Assurances, therefore, were obtained from GOB that:
(a)  a comprehensive study of the electricity tariff structure
and levels would be carried out for the purpose of improving
financial performance of EPC through tariff modifications;
and
(b) the results of the study and GOB's proposals on tariff mod-
ifications would be submitted to IDA by March 1981.
8.38      Fiscal Rate of Return (FRR) to the Power Component. 1/  EPC/GOB
would realize a 6.9% FRR 2/ based on the new tariff rates (averaging 26.5
pyas or US4 4/kWh) and future revisions to keep electricity tariffs relative
to other prices in the economy. Alternatively, should the new rates remain
unchanged over the 1980-90 period (para 8.28), EPC/GOB would achieve a FRR of
0.6% (Annex 3, Table 17). These results clearly demonstrate the need for GOB
to review its tariff structure and level for maintenance and enhancement of
real revenues. With this view and in the context of total EPC operations, as
specified above, agreement will be sought with GOB to study the electricity
tariff structure and level with a view to adjust rates to permit EPC to oper-
ate with greater financial integrity, in consonance with stated GOB objectives.

IX. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION, AND RISKS
Overall Effects
9.01      Agriculture.  The project would principally enable intensification
and upgrading of agriculture in the project area through rehabilitation of an
existing irrigation network, expansion of the irrigation system into a cur-
rently dry area, and installation of complementary infrastructure such as
extension, agricultural research, and implement servicing. Through annual
incremental paddy production of 121,000 tons, the project would assist Burma
in recapturing part of its once large export market; the project would permit
rice exports at full development (1994) to expand by about 49,800 tons p.a.,
or about 6% above projected 1983 levels (900,000 tons). The project area
alone would be able to produce an estimated 42,100 incremental tons of seed
cotton at full development, an amount equal to 1978 estimated production
nationwide. In addition, cotton output from the project would be totally
medium-staple cotton, much in demand for Burma's milling industry. The
project would thus allow Burma to conserve scarce foreign exchange by substi-
tuting incremental domestic cotton production (12,100 tons of lint) for an
equivalent amount of imported intermediate and finished textile commodities.
Byproducts from GOB-procured incremental seed cotton are expected to reach
annually about 10,200 tons of oilseed cake (exportable commodity) and 4,000
tons industrial oil (import substitute). The project would also enable
greater farm family use and off-farm sales.
9.02      Power.  The project would also provide the economy with 28 MW firm
capacity 1/ of electric power with an average annual energy production of 165
GWh. With projected future demand (paras 3.08-3.11), installation of the
Nyaunggyat hydroelectric power facility would permit Burma to forego a rela-
tively costly petroleum-fueled thermal alternative to generate equivalent
power (para 9.07).
Employment Opportunities in Agriculture
9.03      Through the project, farm labor requirements in the project area
would increase from about 8.3 M mandays at present to an estimated 22.3 M man-
days p.a. at full development (year 14). With increased land productivity,
on-farm utilization of family labor would practically double, principally
through increased work activities in currently slack periods. At the present
time, laborers are hired for about 1.0 M mandays each year, or about 12% of
requirements; with the project, hired labor requirements would rise to about
8.4 M1 mandays, or about 38% of requirements. Landless families and farm
families allocated sub-economic holdings are now the principal suppliers of
such labor; additionally, dryland farmers frequently migrate into the currently
irrigated tract to assist in paddy transplanting and harvesting. However,
given higher land use intensities anticipated with the project, overall scope
for inter-tract labor migration may be somewhat curtailed. Additional require-
ments should be adequately met, however, through the projected 39% increase
1/   Guaranteed six hours peak output at 90% probability level.

(0.7 M mandays/mo) in the project area labor force by full development and
through seasonal labor obtained traditionally from neighboring Meiktila and
Myingyan Townships.
Household Income Effects from the Agricultural Component
9.04      As discussed in paras 8.22-8.27 and summarized in Annex 3, Table 7,
current family incomes in the project area mainly reflect present access to
irrigation facilities, or a lack thereof. Therefore, once infrastructure
and supporting services are installed throughout the area, farmers would
benefit by varying degrees because of differing agricultural circumstances
without the project. In the rehabilitation tract at the present time, few
farm families appear to be below the current IBRD-estimated absolute poverty
line of US$68 per capita p.a.; however, about 43% of these farm families lie
between this estimated poverty line and the national average per capita income
of US$120 p.a. In the dryland zone, on the other hand, most farmers appear
to fall below the absolute poverty line; and about 50% at or below the esti-
mated relative poverty line of US$36 per capita p.a. Therefore, for the total
project area, an estimated 19% of area farm families currently earn per capita
incomes at or below the estimated relative poverty line; another 19%, between
the estimated relative and absolute poverty levels; 27%, between the absolute
poverty line and the national average; and about 35%, above the national
average. As presented in Table 7, minimal change is anticipated in the future
were the project not undertaken. However, with successful project implementa-
tion all farm families are likely to realize per capita income levels above
the national average.
9.05      The relatively conservative assumption that farms in the newly
irrigated area larger than 12 ac will be subdivided has been incorporated into
farm budget and economic analyses. This assumption would mean, for example,
that at least 3,900 additional families could be allocated irrigated plots.
This allocation would represent about 40% of the currently landless families
or 31% of the new families projected for the project area by full development.
It is hoped that further action along these lines can be accomplished on even
smaller farms expected to begin intensive cotton cultivation. In addition,
about 11,000 acres of bush land would be developed and irrigated through the
project. This area could accommodate at least 1,100 settler families--a group
well in excess of the 100 families to be displaced from the dam area
(para 7.29).
Hydroelectric Power
9.06      Power Output.  The proposed Nyaunggyat hydroelectric power plant
would provide 28 MW firm capacity at a probability level of 90% and an aver-
age annual energy of 165 GWh. The plant would provide power to the system
at variable rates according to daily power demand and irrigation water needs,
with power generation ranging from six hours per day at 33 MW in July to 13
hours per day at 52 MW in November on average. The amount of incremental
energy that could be absorbed into the existing transmission system during the
initial period after project completion has been calculated based on the demand
for the northern area (Mandalay, Chauk, and Thazi) and its load curve. About



- 61 -
128 GWh, 143 GWh, and 155 GWh could be absorbed in 1986, 1987, and 1988,
respectively. From 1989, the total output of 165 GWh would be utilized fully
in the northern area. Energy absorbed during the first three years can be
broken into two functional categories: (a) a portion to meet incremental
demand requirements; and (b) a portion to substitute for Kyunchaung gas
turbine generation (implying fuel savings). Subsequent to this first three-
year period, incremental energy would be allocated solely to satisfy incre-
mental demand.
9.07      Least Cost Alternative Analysis for Power.  In the absence of an
established system development plan for the power sector through which to
determine whether the Nyaunggyat power component would represent the least
cost approach to meeting anticipated power needs, a simplified project-based
approach was adopted for the analysis. Burma's energy resources include
hydro-potential and limited hydrocarbon fossil fuels. Since there is no other
hydroelectric project that is ready for implementation, the only realistic
alternative to c,ompare with the Nyaunggyat power plant would be a thermal
alternative using petroleum fuel. There are, however, a number of different
types of thermal plants which could be considered. A conventional steam
thermal plant was excluded since it would be less efficient than medium-speed
diesel in view of the plant's size and operating characteristics. Four alter-
natives to the Nyaunggyat plant were analyzed. Those examined include: an
all medium-speed diesel engine (Alternative I); an all gas turbine (Alterna-
tive II); a combination of medium-speed diesel engine (50%) and gas turbine
(50%) (Alternative III); and a combination of medium-speed diesel engine (70%)
and gas turbine (30%) (Alternative IV). These four alternatives--each provid-
ing equivalent firm output and annual energy as anticipated for Nyaunggyat--
were compared by calculating present values (PV) of cost streams over a range
of discount rates. Cost streams, including initial capital, replacement, O&M,
and fuel costs, were developed for the 50-year project life. All costs have
been expressed in economic prices by converting local costs to border kyats.
It was found that Alternative IV would be the least cost thermal alternative
at discount rates above 12% (Annex 3, Table 16).
9.08      The economic cost stream of the power component, consisting of incre-
mental capital, replacement, and O&M costs, was compared with that of Alter-
native IV, the least cost thermal alternative. It was found that the discount
rate which equates the PVs of the two streams would be 15.9%, implying that
the power component of the project would be the least cost solution at discount
rates below 15.9%.
Benefits to the Economy
9.09      Agriculture.  Based on projected 1990 international prices (in 1980
currency units), the annual gross foreign exchange value of incremental pro-
duction of tradeables generated through the project is estimated at about
US$71.4 M at full development. Net of foreign exchange costs for traded recur-
rent inputs (US$6.8 M) and for O&M costs of the dam, irrigation system, and
agricultural support (US$0.5 M), the remaining foreign exchange value would
total about US$64.1 M p.a. Considering all capital and recurrent costs and
benefits valued in border kyats, the Burmese economy is expected to realize
net benefits from agricultural investments of about K 774.4 M (US$115.6 M)



- 62 -
in PV terms, which when annualized over the 50-year expected project life,
would yield about K 93.3 M p.a. (US$13.9 M). For total agricultural capital
costs incurred of about K 4,040 (US$603) per ac affected, annual net benefits
derived at full development would average about K 1,700 (US$254) per ac.
9.10      Power.  By constructing the Nyaunggyat plant, Burma foregoes costs
associated with power generation by the next cheapest alternative (Alternative
IV; see Annex 3, Table 16). The PV of capital and recurrent costs associated
with this thermal plant and the natural gas savings from the Kyunchaung unit
total K 263.3 M (US$39.3 M). The PV of estimated incremental capital and re-
current costs incurred through the Nyaunggyat facility is K 207.9 (US$31.0 M).
Therefore, Burma would benefit from an estimated net cost savings (PV), of
about K 55.4 M (US$8.3 M).
Economic Analysis
9.11      The economy of Burma would realize an economic rate of return (ERR)
from total project investments, inclusive of physical contingencies, of 21.3%.
Were the power component of the project excluded, the PV 1/ of net benefits
from remaining project investments would drop from K 829.8 M to K 774.4 M.
Therefore, since the power component enhances viability, on economic grounds
the multipurpose nature of the project is sound. The analysis implies that
through implementation of the multipurpose project, lower economic costs would
be incurred to achieve anticipated output levels than were separate irrigation
and power projects undertaken. The economic cash flow for the total project
is provided in Annex 3, Table 19 with a full referencing of all underlying
assumptions. The following, however, outline the principal bases of the
economic analysis:
(a)  Project Life.  The project would have an anticipated life of
50 years. Project implementation would require six years:
(i) five for dam construction and installation of the power
plant; but (ii) six for completion of irrigation works.
Agricultural benefits would reach full development level 14
years after the start of the project, implying an eight-year
build-up period to achieve with-project yields once project
irrigation/rehabilitation is provided. Phasing of project
irrigation is specified in Annex 1, Table 11. The power
plant is expected to achieve full development levels by
project year 9, four years after power plant completion.
(b)  Prices.  For internationally traded goods, farmgate prices
were derived from projected 1990 world market prices expressed
in 1980 currency values. Appropriate adjustments were made
for freight, handling, processing, and quality differentials.
Local costs and locally valued benefits were expressed in
border kyats through application of appropriate conversion
factors, as specified in Annex 3, Tables 1-5 and 19. The
1/   12% discount rate.



- 63 -
principal factor used for this purpose was a Standard Conver-
sion Factor (SCF) of 0.80. 1/
(c) Benefits. Incremental crop benefits were based on most
probable yields attainable with project investments. Power
benefits were based on avoidance of costs associated with
thermal power.
(d) Crop Production Costs. Per ac input requirements assumed are
provided in Annex 1, Table 9. The total farm labor contingent,
including family inputs, was assessed at the estimated average
market rate expressed in border kyats (Annex 3, Table 1). Ad-
justment was made in the crop production cost stream to reflect
realistically the staggered incurrence of costs and generation
of benefits in agricultural activities (Annex 3, Table 19).
(e) Secondary and Other Minor Project Effects. The following
effects have been omitted from the economic analyses and are
considered largely offsetting: Benefits: (a) demonstration
effect to farmers outside the project area; (b) incremental
net benefits from project-financed T&V extension efforts in
project townships outside the project area; (c) incremental
employment generated for commodity processing, handling,
transport, and marketing; (d) likely build-up of exploitable
fish populations in the reservoir; (e) flood control; and
(f) remaining economic life and scrap value of construction
equipment. Costs: (a) poor quality timber and firewood scrub
sacrificed in the reservoir area; (b) agricultural output from
about 650 ac of land cultivated under rainfed, subsistence
conditions in two small villages within the reservoir area.
Project Risk
9.12      The Nyaunggyat project would represent Burma's first venture involv-
ing ICB for civil works construction. The risk level, from a potential bidder's
perspective, would be relatively high since there are some unknown factors
affecting contractors' working conditions in Burma. To minimize this risk
GOB has agreed to remove various constraints and provide normal operations for
foreign contractors for ICB works. GOB has also agreed to construct the access
road to the damsite by force account (para 5.11).
9.13      Given the complexity of the project and the difficulties associated
with interrelated works involving ID, EPC, and AC (also a new experience in
Burma), it would be unrealistic to expect problem-free implementation. An
1/   This, as well as other conversion factors, represents the product of pre-
liminary estimates of adjustments to accommodate for the current regime
of taxes, duties, and other trade restrictions in Burma. More detailed
calculations in the future are likely to produce a lower SCF which would
increase project net economic benefits.



- 64 -
inherent risk in any multipurpose project concerns coordination in imple-
menting the various components. With this in mind, GOB has agreed to appoint
as Director for the Nyaunggyat project an ID officer of more senior rank
than directors for other IDA-financed projects in Burma.  Also, project
organization has been designed to facilitate early resolution of implementa-
tion bottlenecks at the highest levels through the PIC (paras 7.02 and 7.10).
9.14      The project could face some risk from the usual delays in posting
additional professional and technical staff, particularly design and construc-
tion engineers. There is no current or foreseen shortage of new engineering
graduates. However, mobilization of experienced construction engineers
requires reshuffling of some ID engineers already in service and employment of
new engineers. ID is aware of the problem and is expected to make necessary
arrangements for staff mobilization by August 1980.
9.15      The project would permit considerable improvement in productivity
over yields obtained currently under rainfed conditions. A relatively lengthy
eight-year educative period has been assumed to reach full development yields
once irrigation is provided. These yields are considered realistic given:
(a) current research farm results (Annex 1, Table 12); (b) proposed extension
input; (c) proposed demonstrations in the currently dryland tract to intro-
duce intensive cotton cultivation under irrigated conditions before the start
of irrigation; and (d) the demonstration effect from currently irrigated
areas. Farmers from the dryland tract, which forms a crescent around the
rehabilitation area, currently work within the irrigated zone during peak
periods to supplement farm income. This factor would be of great importance
to speed transfer of proposed irrigation technology into the new area.
However, projected yields are predicated upon GOB provision of sufficient
supplies of yield-augmenting inputs, extension services, and credit, as well
as of incentive output pricing. Assurances will be sought to ensure their
provision (paras 5.23, 7.06, and 8.34).
9.16      Sensitivity Tests.  Sensitivity tests were performed to assess the
impact of variations in incremental costs and benefit streams on the project's
viability. Switching values (sv) 1/ for individual and total cost and benefit
streams are provided in Annex 3, Table 12 (agricultural component), Table 18
(power component), and Table 20 (total project). These tables also present
PVs for total cost and benefit streams with their breakdown into respective
categories. While an opportunity cost of capital of 12% has been assumed
throughout the analysis, SVs were also calculated at lower and higher dis-
count rates (10-16% p.a.). A plot of PVs for total project cost and benefit
streams against various discount rates is presented in Annex 4, Chart 8 (a);
a locus of all possible SVs for aggregate costs and benefits 2/ is provided

zero at a specified discount rate, e.g., the opportunity cost of
capital.

- 65 -
in Chart 8 (b). The SVs demonstrate, and the figures illustrate, the large
amount of shock the project and its components can bear and still retain
economic viability.
9.17      As another demonstration of resilience, the project's implementation
period was lengthened by two years to test for the effects of risks discussed
in paras 9.12-9.14. With delay of benefits and some costs to reflect this
change, the net PV for the total project would fall from a base case of
K 829.8 M to K 607.7 M, and the ERR would decline from 21% to about 19%.
Since the power component would still make a K 26.1 M contribution to the
project's net PV, the multipurpose nature of the project should be retained
even with this two-year extension. Lastly, if cotton yields reach only 1,000
lbs per ac with the project, instead of the 1,500 lbs anticipated, the net PV
for the agricultural component would decline by 46% to K 417.6 M and the net
PV for the total project would decrease to K 473.2 M, and the ERR would drop
to about 18%.

on IBRD Commodities and Export Projection Division projections, May 1979.
2/ Assumes average of 28% broken and therefore 26.5% discount on quality grounds from fob
Bangkok price. With installation of new milling capacity in future, brokens percentage
assumed to drop from current average of 35% to 28%; see6/

Project permits substitution of locally grown rice for shipments of rice from Lower Burma
and therefore incremental export of a quantity equivalent to incremental project output.
6/ Assumes 30% of incremental production milled in older mills and 70% processed in new
facilities. Net milling charge assumed K 50/m ton rice in older facilities and K 150 in new
facilities.

Economic Cash Flow--Footnotes
1/ Reference Annex 1, Tables 8 and 9 and Annex 3, Table 1.
2/ Incremental analyses incorporate as a project cost net benefits foregone
on 6,810 ac (6% of 113,500 ac) placed under irrigation channel system in
the newly irrigated tract.
3/ Representating next least cost alternative utilizing mixture of medium-diesel
(70%) and gas turbine (30%).
4/ Local cost components converted to border Kyats at Standard Conversion
Factor (SCF) of 0.80.
Calculated at 2% of construction costs p.a.
6/ Estimated at 70% of Arabian light crude oil price (1990 in 1980 US$)
projected by EPD (US$34/barrel).
7/ Represents a fuel savings for the Kyunchaung gas turbine. The economic cost
savings was estimated by equating the cost of heat content of natural gas
to that of heavy residual oil currently exported. The economic benefit
(cost saving) so derived represents about US$3.4/kWh.

component.
13!  Based on a base financial cost of 1.2 M K p.a. Local cost component (50%)
converted to border Kyats at SCF (0.80).
14/ Based on following p.a. incremental financial cost assumptions: K 5/ac
incremental in currently irrigated tract and K 35/ac incremental in newly
irrigated tract. Local cost component (50%) converted to border Kyats at
SCF (0.80).
t1/  Based on financial cost of K 1.2 M  p.a.  Local cost component (67%) converted
to border Kyats at SCF (0.80).
16/ Reference Annex 3, Tables 8 to 11. The stream of economic agricultural
production costs has been adjusted to reflect the non-simultaneous incurrence
of costs and realization of benefits. See W. Schaefer-Kehnert, The Phasing
of Inflow and Outflow in Farm Cash Flow Projections, EDI Course Notes CN-8,
June 1978.
