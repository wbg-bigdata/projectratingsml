MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE JIANGSU PROVINCIAL TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan and
development credit to the People's Republic of China is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan for $100.0 million would have a 20-year maturity
including 5 years of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate; the
proposed credit for SDR 38.5 million ($53.6 million equivalent) would be
issued on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity. The loan and credit
would help to finance the expansion and improvement of the transport network.
Proposed on-lending terms between the Ministry of Finance and Jiangsu Province
are: 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at 5.925 percent interest per
annum with 0.75 percent per annum commitment fee on outstanding balance.
Jiangsu Provincial Government will bear the foreign exchange risks.
2.        Background. China's growth in the 1980s was well in excess of plan
targets and placed a heavy strain on the transport system. In spite of very
high rates of utilization, regional transport bottlenecks have become apparent
and they have begun to affect, adversely, the pace of economic activity. The
need to loosen these constraints has been fully recognized by the Chinese
government, which has assigned a high priority to an expansion of the trans-
port infrastructure. During 1989190, investment in the transport sector was
increased significantly at a time when capital spending in most other sectors
was either constant or declining. This has helped to accelerate the growth of
traffic carrying capacity, but further effort will be needed before the gap
between demand and supply is narrowed.
3.        The most critical need is to expand road capacity,'especially in
areas where increased agricultural and small-scale industrial production have
created a demand for better farm-to-market transport services. Road transport
will have to absorb a growing share of the demand for passenger transportation
as urbanization increases and the population becomes more mobile. Inland
waterways--the least costly mode of transport for bulk cargo--also need to be
developed so as to supplement other modes and enhance the efficiency of the
system.
4.        By the end of the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90), freight traffic
was estimated to be 45 percent higher than in 1985, and passenger traffic
50 percent higher. Although substantial investments have gone into highway
network expansion, new rail lines, double-tracking and electrification of
existing lines, maintenance and expansion of navigable waterway systems, and
capacity improvements at coastal ports, much more will be needed during the
Eighth Plan period (1991-96). The new Plan also proposes to secure efficiency
gains in transportation frow aperational improvements; these include the
development of integrated t1..nsportation networks for coal transportation and
the importlexport trade, and technological improvements such as container
handling facilities and intermodal transport centers. To facilitate these
developments, the Government of China (GOC) envisions significant institu-



- 2 -
tional changes in the sector, including an extension of the policy of separat-
ing the functions of government from those of operating enterprises and dele-
gating authority to local management.
5.        The Bank fully subscribes to the Government's objectives for devel-
oping the transport sector and is supporting its initiatives with financial
and technical assistance. Four railway projects (Loans 2394-CHA, 2540-CHA,
2678-CHA/Credit 1680-CHA, and Loan 2968-CHA) are helping to expand capacity on
key routes and increase the manufacture of electric locomotives, passenger
coaches, and signaling equipment. Six port projects (Loans '207-CHA, 2689-
CHA, 2907-CHA, and 2877-CHA, 3006-CHA, and 3007-CHA) will effect improvements
at Tianjin, Shanghai, Dalian, Huangpu, Ningbo, and Xiamen ports. The five
Bank-assisted highway projects (Loan 2539-CHA/Credit 1594-CHA, Loan 2811-CUAl
Credit 1792-CHA, Loan 2951-CHA/Credit 1917-CMA, Loan 2952-CMA, and Credit
1984-CHA) involve the construction and improvement of national and rural
roads, the first expressway in China, and several major provincial trunk
roads. The proposed project would allow the Bank to become involved for the
first time in a provincial transport investment and rehabilitation program.
The project also represents the first attempt to review the road and waterway
systems together as part of an integrated plan for transport system develop-
ment. If successful, this operation could pave the way for full-scale sector
lending to China in the future.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Owing to the gradual devolution of
responsibility for investment and development from central government agencies
in Beijing to counterpart units in the provinces, the Bank's operational dia-
logue is increasingly directed to regional and local development priorities at
the provincial level. Consistent with this trend and in order to maximize the
impact and improve the efficiency of its lending operations, the Bank agreed
with the central authorities that Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Tianjin should be the
foci of a more direct lending relationship through operations in transport
infrastructure, industry, and urban development. In parallel to the project-
based provincial dialogue, the Bank is also assisting in carrying out of the
Yangtze Economic Zone Transport Study involving Jiangsu and its neighboring
provinces of Anhui and Zhejiang, and the municipality of Shanghai. Given the
Bank's comparative advantage in economic and sector work, it is well posi-
tioned to help the provincial authorities concerned formulate and implement
integrated multimodal strategies, investment, rehabilitation, maintenance and
operational plans. It is this broad strategic goal which is the principal
rationale for Bank involvement in the proposed project.
7.        Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project has two objectives:
(i) in the short term, to help mitigate the most serious constraints posed by
the province's inadequate transport infrastructure on its fast developing
economy and that of its neighbors; and (ii) in the long term, to assist the
province in upgrading the planning, budgeting and implementation of transport
works, and in developing more efficient construction entities. A large tech-
nical assistance component is designed to help improve the skill and quality
of provincial transport staff more efficiently plan and implement the proposed
project and achieve the long-term institutional objectives.
8.        Project Description.  To accomplish these objectives, the project
includess (a) a three-phase slice of Jiangsu Provincial Government's (JPG)
road network rehabilitation prog-am, the first such program within the Bank's



-3-
transport projects in China; (b) rehabilitation of the Nanjing-Shanghai corri-
dor road; (c) rehabilitation of the Danyang section of the Grand Canal;
(d) construction of a new shiplock at Nantong and an adjacent bridge at
Jiuweigang; (e) consulting services to help train Jiangsu Provincial Coimmuni-
cations Department (JPCD) staff in the supervision and quality control of
civil works included in the project; (f) assistance to JPCD in devising an
immediate and long-term plan of action to develop independent construction
units; and (g) technical assistance fort (i) evaluating existing road pave-
ments and preparing a pavement strengthening and maintenance programS;
*          (ii) improving the design and planning of roads and waterways, including
establishment of a road data bank, and introducing computer-aided design;
(iii) assistance in carrying out the provinci4i transport corridor study; and
(iv) staff training.  The main thrust of the technical assistance component is
to strengthen the ability of transport staff at both the provincial and county
levels in the areas of project management, transport investment planning, and
implementation.
9.        Environmental Effects.  The project would have a positive environ-
mental impact. Construction will take place in the flatter area of Jiangsu
province, where little erosion is expected, while JPCD will protect any sig-
nificant embankments and cuts with stone pitchings. Given that the project
highways, by helping separate motorized and nonmotorized traffic, will make
vehicle flows more uniform, emissions and accidents will be reduced. The
waterway components, by enlarging their cross-sections, are expected to help
improve water quality by increasing the water discharged from the Yangtze
river into the canals. Finally, land for construction of the project will be
acquired and measures will be taken during project construction to protect the
environment in accordance with GOC regulations found by the Bank to be fair
and equitable and that are strictly enforced, with penalties set for any devi-
ations. Detailed land acquisition schedule, environmental and resettlement
plans were prepared by JPCD and submitted for review by the Bank and found
satisfactory.
10.       Schedule A shyws the estimated project costs and financing plan.
Schedule B shows procurement methods and estimated disbursements. Retroactive
financing of up to SDR 11.0 million ($15.3 million equivalent) would be made
for expenditures made after November 15, 1988. Schedule C shows a timetable
for project processing, and Schedule D shows the status of Bank Group opera-
*         tions in China.  A map depicting the project components is attached.  A Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7706-CHA dated March 18, 1991, is being distributed
separately.
11.       Actions Agreed.  Agreements were reached during negotiations with
Jiangsu Province ons
(a) the criteria and procedures to be followed in selecting subprojects
for the second and third phases of the provincial road upgrading
program, and the submission to the Bank/IDA for concurrence of the
subprojects for the second and third phases of the program by Octo-
ber 31, 1991 and October 31, 1992, respectively;
(b) studies for developing independent construction units and for the
provincial transport corridor according to terms of reference and
timing agreeable to the Bank/IDA;



-4-
(c) training under a program agreed with the Bank/IDA;
(d) the resettlement under the project to be carried out in accordance
with the plan agreed with the Bank/IDA; and
(e) the accounts of project-related expenditures will be audited by
independent auditors and sent to the Bank/IDA for review within six
morths of the close of each fiscal year.
State Council approval of the Loan Agreement and Development Credit Agreement
will be a condition of effectiveness.
12.       Project Benefits and Risks.  The principal benefits accruing to
users of the newly rehabilitated highway and waterway would be savings in
vehicle operating costs, savings in ship and barge waiting times and reduced
accidents. JPCD will benefit from reduced costs and greater longevity of
assets resulting from improvements in planning, tendering, and supervision of
construction. No technical risks are foreseen for the project because the
technology to be used in all works is well established. However, this is the
first Bank project with Jiangsu province, and it contains a large uumber of
subprojects involving the construction units of cities and counties for which
JPCD will have to rearrange their responsibilities. In order to minimize
these implementation risks, the Bank hass (i) agreed with JPCD on an imple-
mentation organ±zation with clear lines of authority and responsibility; and
(ii) required JPCD to carry out, with consultant assistance, independent
supervision of all civil works construction including that by city and county
construction units.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association, respec-
tively, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan
and credit.
