PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2351-PAK)
PREFAC
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Petroleum
Exploration Project in Pakistan, for which Loan 2351-PAK in the amount of US$51.5
million was approved on October 18, 1983. The loan was closed on March 31, 1989,
two years behind the original schedule.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Energy Operations Division of
the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary,
Parts I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia, on the President's
Report; the Loan and Guarantee Agreements; supervislon reports; project progress
reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank
memoranda.

(LOAN 2351-PAK)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Intr2du9tion
1.          This was the second petroleum exploration project supported by the
Bank, the first being an IDA grant for Toot Oil and Gas Development. The Bank
loan of US$51.5 million was given to the Oil and Gas Development Corporation
(OGDC), with the guarantee of the Government of Pakistan (GOP).
Objectives
2.          The project had two main objectives: to accelerate the exploration
of natural gas in Pakistan and to enhance the chances of joint-venture
exploration by both foreign and domestic oil companies (PCR, Part I, para. 3.01).
Implementation Experience
3.          The loan closing was extended by two years (two one-year extensions
were granted) to complete the expanded drilling program and to complete the
Exploration Fromotion Program. Disbursement of the loan was slower than forecast
due to an overly optimistic schedule; delays in completing the basin studies
which were a prerequisite for the Exploration Promotion Program; and additional
time required to complete the expanded drilling program (PCR, Part I, paras.
3.05, 4.06, 4.08, and Part III, Section 3). The performance of the consultants
and contractors. both expatriate and local, was generally satisfactory, although
there were some notable exceptions that resulted in schedule slippages (PCR, Part
I, para. 7.01). OGDC was able to utilize consultant services effectively (PCR,
Part I, para.  7.02).   In general,  the technical performance of OGDC was
satisfactory; however, administrative and procurement delays resulted in schedule
delays (PCR, Part I, paras. 6.03, 6.04). OGDC was deficient in implementing a
f4nenintl man1aamrnt Rysfam. A                 thA         #cU^tr_v4t _:v.-4     ( Tb- -_
I, paras. 6.05, 6.06, 6.07, and Part III, Section 7). Except for establishing
an unrealistic project schedule, the Bank's performance was satisfactory, and
missions were staffed with the necessary technical specialists (PCR, Part I,
paras. 6.01, 6.02).



iv
Resultg
4.          The project had positive measurable results in four areas: technical
capability of OGDC staff was upgraded, comprehensive data base for exploration
was established, international interest in exploration in Pakistan was enhanced,
and commercial gas was discovered (PCR, Part I, paras. 5.01, 5.02).
Sustainability
5.          OUDC staff has improved its field operations and its skills in data
acquisition aad interpretation. As a result, OGDC will have a greater capability
to evaluate exploration ventures and to present a more coherent image to the
international oil industry regarding the prospects for increasing oil and gas
production in Pakistan (PCR, Part I, para. 5.03).
Findings and Lessons
6.          The project experience highlights  the  importance of utilizing
consultants for technical assistance, especially in potentially complicated areas
like field operations and seismic analysis. If the consultants provide training,
in addition to completing specific assignments, the result is a more qualified
in-country staff that can sustain the success of the project.
7.          It is important to establish a realistic implementation schedule.
This eliminates the unnecessary expenditure of administrative time to negotiate
and approve loan extensions.

2. Background
2.01     In the decade preceding project appraisal in 1983, Pakistan had been
actively developing its indigenous energy resources, in particular natural gas
and hydro electricity, with the stated goal of limiting oil imports. However,
despite the efforts to implement this strategy, the country remained heavily
dependent on imported oil to meet its primary energy needs. Over 90X of the
oil demand is satisfied by imports which totalled US$1.6 billion in 1980/81,
equivalent to 261 cf total imports.
2.02     Although Pakistan's strategy of developing indigenous energy resources
had reduced th1  share of oil in the total energy supply from 451 to 37X during
the preceding decade, oil imports had increased by 331 during the same period.
This increase reflects the significant growth in total energy demand, and the
modest domestic oil reserves and corresponding low rate of production. Studies
b.d sh_ -.tt without major pol'cy 1n't'atveSa, vv&t oll ivpi'    wuuld double
by FY89 and quadruple by FY93. This would impose pressures on the balance of
payments that could seriously impair the country's prospects for continued
economic growth.
2.03     In its dialogue with the Government of Pakistan (GOP),  the Bank
constantly stressed the critical importance of accelerating the exploration and
development of domestic energy resources to substitute for imported oil, and the
need to encourage greater private sector participation in the implementation and
financing of energy investments. With the emergence of gas shortages and higher
imported oil costs, GOP recognized the urgency of these measures and instituted
a range of policy reforms which were expected to result in a considerable
improvement in the energy situation in the medium term.
2.04     To achieve a better balance in the energy demand-supply relationship,
GOP identified the following key measures:
(a)  energy management and conservation programs to limit the growth
in demand through price and non-price policy instruments;
(b)  accelerated  development  of  proven  oil  and  gas  fields  and
initensified exploration for additional domestic energy reserves
.   .   .. 



- 2 -
(c) increased participation of private companies in the financing and
implementation of energy investments.
2.05     To accomplish the last two measures, the need for an oil and gas project
was identified in 1980.   During the intervening two years, the Oil and Gas
Development Corperation (OGDC) attempted to attract risk capital for exploration
in gas prone areas, but private companier clearly indicated that they were not
interested in exploring for gas despite the existence of a large, well
established domestic market and reasonable producer pricing policies. No bids
were received to an October 1982 offering of 11 blocks, with definite petroleum
potential and under license to OGDC.
2.06     The Bank concluded that additional bid invitations to the international
oil industry should be postponed until OGDC could identify further potential
areas through regional seismic and basin studies. Subsequently, the oil and gas
project, originally identified in 1980, was split into two separate operations:
the Second Toot Oil and Gas Development Project and the subject project, the
Petroleum Exploration Project.   OGDC completed the project preparation with
assistance from consultants and Bank staff.
3. Prolect Oblectives and Description
3.01     The project had two main objectives:
(a) to accelerate the exploration of natural gas in Pakistan; and
(b) to enhance the chances of joint-venture exploration by both foreign
and domestic private oil companies.
3.02     The project, as originally envisaged, was to comprise the following
components:
(a)  Petroleum Exnloration.  Drilling of six exploratory wells to test
structures for hydrocarbon deposits.
(b)  Basin Studies.  Program of regional basin studies to provide a
basis for identifying prospective geological areas.
(c)  Seismic Profiles.   Acquisition of about 3,000 km of largely
regional reconnaissance seismic profiles.
(d)  Computer Equipment.  Purchase of computer equipment, primarily in
the seismic data analysis area, to support project activities.
(e)  Exploration Promotion Program.  Program utilizing the results of
the basin and seismic studies to promote exploration by the
international oil industry.



-3.
3.03     Estimated cost of the project was $107.1 million, of which $59.5 million
was foreign exchange costs. The Bank loan of $51.5 million and bilateral credits
of $8 million were to finance the foreign exchange component.
Change in Proiect Scop@
3.04     As a result of the discovery of a promising gas field at Loti, a
reservoir study to evaluate the gas potential and development program for the
field was added to tne scope of the project in July 1985.
3.05     Because the drilling program was forecasting a significant underrun of
$28 million, a result of less difficult drilling conditions than anticipated,
and the promising discovery of gas at Loti field, OGDC requested that the project
agreement be amended to permit the drilling of additional wells. In September
1986, the Bank approved an amendment which specified that about six exploratory
wells and additional appraisal/delineation wells as required would be drilled.
It was anticipated that a maximum of twelve wells would be drilled under the
project.
3.06     The consultants preparing the basin habitat study recommended that an
additional 1,500 km of seismic profiles be recorded.  The Bank approved the
increase for a total of 4,500 km of seismic lines to be collected under the
project in December 1986.
4.  Proiect Organization-and-ImRIementation
4.01     OGDC is the national oil company of Pakistan.  Oil and gas exploration
and development is carried out by OGDC and also by a number of international oil
companies under joint venture concession agreements with OGDC and/or GOP. As
mentioned previously, this project was designed to stimulate increased interest
in exploration by private petroleum companies.
4.02     OGDC established a project team to implement the exploration program.
The team received advice on an as-required basis from an experienced exploration
consulting firm and was responsible for: selecting new locations and formulating
the drilling program for the exploratory wells; design and implementation of the
regional seismic program; and implementation of the basin studies and promotion
vrogram.
4.03     The dril'.ing program was conducted by expatriate crews and by OGDC
crews with expatriate drilling supervisors. Compared to the original dril14ng
program schedule, all drilling activity was begur behind schedule (from one
month to two years). Drilling conditions were much '.s8 severe than anticipated,
resulting in a potential cost mnderrun. As indicated in Paragraph 3.05, the
drilling program was expanded in response to this situation. In general, the
drilling work was performed satisfactorily although one well services contractor
was cited for unsatisfactory performance on several occasions.
4.04     The regional seismic data was collected by local seismic crews with
ex-patriate technical support.  One of the crews was repla&ced because of the



4-
poor quality of seismic data collected.
4.05     The procurement of the seismic data processing equipment was delayed
by one year because the vendor had difficulty to obtain an export license from
the U.S. government.   This delay in establishing a local seismic processing
center necessitated the processing of data outside the country at a higher cost
to the project.
4.06     The habitat basin study was carried out by an international consultant
that also provided assistance with the promotion program. The quality of the
work was satisfactory. However, numerous delays were encountered. In November
1986, it was expected that the final report would be completed by the end of May
1987, and the promotional package presented to the international petroleum
industry in November/December 1987. In fact, the final report was not received
until late April 1988, with the promotional meetings conducted in December 1988.
4.07     The exploration promotional package was well prepared and two seminars
were held: Houston, with 65 oil companies represented, on December 6, and London,
with 43 oil companies attending, on December 13, 1988. Through these seminars,
OGDC was able to brief 106 different companies (two companies attended both
seminars) of the international oil industry. As a direct result of the promotion
program, six joint ventures for petroleum exploration have been established.
As a result of this project and the Petroleum Resources Joint Venture Project,
Loan 2553-PAK, twenty-two joint venture agreements have now been formed for
exploration activities.
4.08     The project schedule, as stated in the Loan Agreement, was optimistic
and perhaps unrealistic. OGDC's schedule, as discussud with a Bank mission in
early November 1983, clearly indicated that the exploration promotion program
would continue through all of 1986 and the drilling program would not be
completed until late 1986. Ye. a project completion date of September 30, 1986
and a loan closing date of March 31, 1987 were established, which failed to take
account of the best data available at the time. Ftirthermore, such a schedule
made no provision for schedule contingencies, which are always inherent in an
uncertain operation, such as a drilling program. In December 1986, GOP requested
a two year extension of the loan closing until March 31, 1989. In February 1987,
the Bank granted a one year extension; in March 1988, the second and final one
year extension was approved.
5. Project Results and Sustainabilitv
5.01     The project had positive measurable results in four areas.
(a)  The technical capability of OGDC staff was upgraded in well
drilling operations and data acquisition and interpretation skills.
By introducing well drilling operations by contractors, a measure
of competition was added and OGDC crews were able to improve their
performance in drilling and well completions. By improving basic
skills, it was possible to drill more wells for the same
(appraisal) cost.



5-
(b) A more comprehensive data base for exploration was established.
This has permitted OGDC to develop a more systematic exploration
program and to divide the country logically into meaningful
concession areas.
(c) Interest in undertaking exploration activities in Pakistan was
enhanced among the international oil industry. The habitat basin
study allowed OGDC to highlight areas for exploration. Six Joint
ventures for petroleum exploration have been formed as a result
of the project.
(d) Commercial gas, with estimated recoverable reserves of 410 bcf,
was discovered at Loti Field. Initial contract production from
Loti, commencing in 1989, was planned at 40 MMcfd for the first
four years of the 15 year contract.
5.02     The estimated recoverable Loti reserves of 410 bcf represented a 2.5X
increase in the total domestic gas supply, estimated at 16.4 tef in 1987. A
reservoir evaluation of the Loti Field was undertaken in January-February 1991
by OGDC's Reservoir Engineering Department.  This evaluation indicated total
recoverable reserves of 410 bcf. Field production of 70 MMcfd could be attained
by drilling six additional wells. Loti gas production would be 70 MMcfd for a
period of 12 years and 24 MMcfd for the following 6 years, for a total production
of 390 bcf.  If a gas price of $0.858/Mcf is assumed, Wotal revenues of $335
million would be realized over the life of the Loti Field.   A table of
production, cost, and revenues for the Loti Field is presented in Part III,
Section 6.
5.03     Because of the more comprehensive data base, the ability to undertake
higher quality data acquisition and interpretation activities, and improved
field operational skills, OGDC should be able to develop better directed drilling
programs in the future.  In addition, OGDC will have a greater capability to
evaluate exploration ventures and to present a mnrs enhor4rt! image to the
international oil industry regarding the prospects for increasing oil production
in Pakistan.
6.  Performance of the Bank and the Borrower
6.01     The performance of the Bank from project identification through project
completion was satisfactory. Supervision missions wero frequent and were always
staffed with technical specialists who could provide sound professional advice
tv the staff of OGDC on issues concerning the drilling program, the seismic data,
and the exploration promotion program. However, the timetable for implementation
was not realistic and was inconsistent with the Borrower's own data.
6.02     The decision to expand the scope of the drilling program when faced
with a sizable cost underrun was prudent.   The additional appraisal well
activities on the Loti field have resulted in 40 mcf per day of gas being added
to the country's gas supply. Delivery of this gas to the SNGPL pipeline started
in early 1989.



6.03     The performance of OGDC was mixed.   It established a reasonably
effective project organization and diligently pressed its drilling program.
The daily review meetings of drilling progress served to keep supervisory staff
well informed about the program's objectives.  For the most part the need for
consultants was readily recognized, and consultants were used effectively to
increase the technical capability of the OGDC staff, particularly in areas where
OGDC was weak. The staff is now better able to analyze field and seismic data
and to establish effective programs for future exploration and development.
6.04     On che administrative side, however, there is considerable need for
improvement. While the initial procurement plan was well established, the
execution was often flawed. There was a delay of one year in the procurement
of cables and accessories for the seismic work, a vital preliminary step to the
exploration promotion program.   There was an eight week delay in evaluating
finanicial bids for the Loti reservoir study, again an important element in
accelerating the exploration and development of natural gas.
6.05     OGDC has been slow in complying with the covenant requiring that a
financial management action program, satisfactory to the Bank, be established.
Under bilateral donor programs, CIDA provided assistance for implementing a
financial management system while USAID was to finance an international audit
of OGDC's accounts. The CIDA program provided funds to address deficiencies in
the financial management area; however, because OGDC was unaware of the extent
of the problems, the TOR for appointment of the CIDA consultant was inadequate.
In order to provide the basis for identifying the extent and areas of required
improvements, the Bank, together with other donors, recommended that OGDC recruit
international  auditors.    However,  because  of  delays  in recruitment,  the
appointment of international auditors was not effected until early 1990, more
than one year after project completion.
6.06     Recognizing the lack of progress in the financial management area, the
Bank, under ESL II (Ln. 3107-PAK) embarked on a comprehensive institutional
development program for OGDC beginning in FY89.   Under this program,  the
Government agreed to introduce the following measures to enable OGDC to operate
as a commercially-oriented and financially autonomous entity: (i) provide funds
to OGDC on a loan basis only beginning in 1989/1990 (completed); (ii) appoint
i"ternationally experienced independent auditors acceptable to the Bank to audit,
in accordance with international accounting standards and auditing procedures,
OGDC's financial operations for fiscal years 1990 and 1991 (audit completed for
1990, audit for 1991 underway); (iii) implement a financial restructuring plan
for OGDC, providing, inter alia, for adjusting its balance sheet by reconciling
the book value of its current and fixed assets and deferred exploration and
development costs with the results of a physical inventory and valuation of such
assets and a determination of the current value of the deferred costs on the
basis of its estimated oil and gas reserves (all actions are underway); (iv)
recruit consultants to assist OGDC in implementing the financial restructuring
plan (completed, final report under Bank review); (v) promulgate the rules under
the OGDC Ordinance relating to the Board of Directors, management,
administration, accounts and audits (draft final rules are being reviewed by the
Bank); (vi) establish financial performance criteria for OGDC as a condition of
second tranche release (criteria have been established),

6.07     Bank efforts to enable OGDC to achieve fiuancial autonomy and efficiency
are continuing with the proposed Domestic Energy Resource Development Project
(FY92) which would provide for: (i) major corporate restructuring of OGDC to
introduce cost consciousness in the Corporation and development of a corporate
planning system; (ii) develop and implement a modern accounting and financial
information and procedures system including a system for proper accounting for
fixed assets and stores and spares and maintenance of separate cost centers;
(iii) automate the accounting and financial information system and provide the
necessary training to OGDC staff; (iv) strengthening of the international audit
process of OGDC's accounts.
7. Consulting Services
7.01     The performance of the consultants and contractors appointed under the
project, both expatriate and local, was generally satisfactory. However, there
were some notable exceptions.
(a) A well service contractor had unsatisfactory performance on several
occasions.
(b) A seismic crew was replaced because of poor quality of seismic
data collected.
(c)  The consultant preparing the habitat basin study produced a quality
report.   However, the report's progress was constantly behind
schedule which also delayed the Exploration Promotion Program.
(d) The supplier of the seismic center computer equipment was one year
late in delivering the equipment because of the difficulty in
obtaining an export license from the US government.
7.02     Despite  the  shortcomings  noted above,  OGDC was  able  to utilize
consultant services effectively, particularly for the purpose of enhancing its
own staff skills.



PART II. PROJECT REVIEW PROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
BACKGROUND
1.          The Part I and III, which were to be completed and provided to the
borrower, are now made available to OGDC. The Bank has adequately depicted
the performance of the project. The analysis forwarded by the Bank cost
under-run and certain delays are Justified. They are attributed due to
certain local constraints. Overall views expressed by the Bank are in
conformity with the borrower's views.
2.          The main purpose of securing this loan was to reduce the country's
heavy dependence on imported petroleum, fuel and explore indigenous source of
natural gas. The project was, therefore, designed to accelerate exploration
of natural gas reserves in the country.
3.          Initially, the loan was to support - I.  Drilling of six
exploratory wells on natural gas prospects in Pakistan. II. Acquisition of
seismic data totaling 3000 KM. III. Regional Basin study and IV.
Procurement of advance seismic data processing system, to  upgrAde OGDC
capability in processing seismic data available in the countr,.
4.          The scope of work was not only expanded but the project was
extended for further two years, i.e. till end March 1989. Due to the success
in the drilling of Loti, Loti Gas Structure and the overall reduction in
estimated cost as compared to the survey appraisal report estimates, it was
agreea that available funds should be used for:
(a)   Appraisal wells at Loti to firm up the potential of this field;
and
(b)   Acquire additional seismic data to increase exploration data base.
After discussion with the Bank, the project was expanded and loan
and project agreement were modified accordingly.
5.          As per expanded scope OGDC drilled ten additional appraisal wells,
covered an aggregate of 4500 KM seismic profile. Similarly under basin study,
Geo-Chemist, Geo-physicist and Quality Control Experts were hired to continue
and lit inattF thp Rsarn  mtelIv report and to super':_ic t1; acquisiti.u u- beibmic
data and their Quality Control.
6.          In order to evaluate the Bank's and Borrower's performance, we
need to analyze the diffarent components of the loan which included (a) Basin
Study analysis and its impact on selection of exploration area, (b) Data
Acquisition Processing, (c) Promotion of joint venture as means of reducing
OGDC risk in exploration, (d) Evaluation of discoveries, procurement,
technology transfer and training inter-departmental arrangements and Quality
Control.
BASIN S     BTUDY
Basin study program was launched in April 1988 and completed in



March 1989. M/S Exploration Consultants Ltd. U.K. were engaged as consultants
who worked jointly with their counter-parts in OGDC to accomplish the
objectives of the study.
In this study, first comprehensive geophysical and well data base
was established comprising (1) computerizing 1-10,000 KM of seismic line
location data and the digitisation of gravity and aeromagnetic data. (2) In
addition a total of 565 wells location, geological formation structure and
lithologic thickness and other related data were also computerized.
Individual data file was established for each well drilled and a
catalogue of exploration and well data showing geological, geophysical and
geochemical reports was prepared.
Furthermore, a report on the hydrocarbon potentials of lower,
middle and upper Indus Basin has been prepared. The report included:
(1)   Volume of hydrocarbon generated.
(2)   Volume of pores spaced available to receive and store hydrocarbon.
(3)   Historical exploration record in finding hydrocarbon.  Complete
Basin Study report was then promoted to the International Oil
Companies.
PETROLEUM PROMOTION
Two seminars, one in Houston, USA and another in London, UK, were
held to promote the Basin Study Report.
During these meetings a total of 43 blocks comprising of 236,800
sq. KM area were delineated and offered for exploration to foreign and local
oil companies. Three packages of selected data included seismic, geological,
geophysical, and well drilling histories, were offered. Two other packages,
comprising one for Makran and another for Off Shore area including short point
locations and data on 17 wells drilled in different basins of the country were
also offered.
Over 100 o'l companies participated in these two important
seminars (on Pakistan Hydrocarbon potentials).
The borrowers have received a very positive response to these
seminars. Twenty six applications from different oil companies for twelve out
of forty three offered blocks have been received so far and are being
negotiated with the Government for grant of concessions.
DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM
Another important component of the loan was to procure a seismic
data processing computer system in order to improve the capabilities of
processing of seismic data acquired by several field parties. A computed



- 10 -
system was procured and has the capacity to handle OGDC processing requirement
from the output of 6 land parties, totaling 200 thousands records per year
(96/120 traces and 3000 samples per trace) including approximately 20Z of re-
processing of existing seismic data. The software companies of currently
known advanced processing techniques offered Disco Software. The system
procured from M/S DIGICON consisted of the Hardware Vax 11/78 16 MB main
memory floating point computer system with accompanying software. The main
specifications of the system procured are attached as Appendix-B.
Earlier the borrowers were utilizing Western geophysical pre/seis
system which had been acquired and installed in January 1978 by OGDC. The
system had very limited capacity of 32 memory, and couldn't efficiently
handle the processing requirements of OGDC. The pre/seis was a stand-alone
system compared to Vax 10 multi-processing, time sharing and interactive
system. The installation of new system has enhanced about 10 times capacity
of processing. The software utilized is also very advanced and their final
product from the system is of international standard. The Vax system ha snow
allowed OGDC to efficiently handle the data acquired by its six seismic data
acquisition crews and also enable OGDC to process 3D seismic data, in addition
to the back system discovery work station which is being used for inter active
seismic modeling, mapping contouring and data base for the interpreter.
TRAINING
Sixteen professionals of OGDC received  hands-on training on the
Vax system at DIGICON'S FACILITY in Houston. Out of sixteen, six were
hardware engineers and ten for software. The training period ranged from 10
to 13 weeks for a trainee. This training on a wide scale continued in
Pakistan even after their return from Houston. The trainers were expatriates
from DIGICON who were attached to OGDC to supervise the training and effect a
transfer of technology. The training has been satisfactory. OGDC
professionals acquired the necessary capabilities in a short time since they
had the necessary background and experience and as a result the contract for
an expatriate was concluded for two years after the installation of the
system, effective June 1988. Since that time OGDC staff has been doing data
processing and hardware maintenances independently.
DRILLING PROGRAM
Initially six exploration wells in gas prone area were planned to
be drilled at (1) Shahdadpur, (2) Loti, (3) Afiband, (4) Zindapir, (5)
Piranwalla and (6) Palari Sirki. Due to efficient project implementation,
increased reliance on indigenous resources and lowering of contract period for
drilling in the International Market, the cost incurred to achieve the above
program was much lower than anticipated during project appraisal.
In the light of these cost savings an amendment to expand the
scope of the project was made in the loan.

PERFORMANCE OF BANK
We  wish     to seize this opportunity to express our gratitude
for the good cooperation between Bank and OGDC varticularlv in the technihal
implementation of this project. However, there are still some aspects of
delays in the clearing of procurement and disbursement of invoices which could
be accelerated in order not to delay similar projects in future.
CONCLUgION AND RECOMENDATION
The project has enabled OGDC to improve its acquisition,
processing and drilling capabilities and to accelerate petroleum exploration
in Pakistan through joint efforts with the International Oil Companies.
The project also has identified certain short comings in
exploration work carried out by OGDC. It has emphasized the need for better
quality control both in acquisition, processing and also require training to
the staff in overall petroleum work. Since not all the promoted concessions
have been taken for exploration, it is recommended that OGDC should approach
the Bank for follow up projects of this nature that would include; (a)
Acquisition of additional seismic data in blocks not yet cleared in order to
make them more attractive for promotion, (b) Acquisition of seismic data in
new areas in order to value the hydrocarbon potential, (c) to promote both the
new are and all other concessions not yet cleared, (d) Finally there is also
need to continue the training programme for OGDC professionals in new
technology for data acquisition processing and interpretation.

C. Economic/llnancial Impacts
OGDC's detailed financial statements for 1986-1989 (actual) and provisional
actual for 1990 are presented in Annex 1. During the period 1986-1989, operating
revenues more than doubled to Rs. 2.0 billion as OGDC accelerated production of
oil and gas from previously discovered fields. However, declared accumulated
net losses during this period totaled Rs. 434 million due to losses sustained
during 1987 and 1989 from dry well and offshore drilling charges as well as
continued investments in high-risk exploration. Self-financing of investments
during this period averaged 27%. Debt service was adequate, and the company had
a favorable debt:equity structure. The present financial position of the company
reflects the growth of the corporation in physical rather than financial terms.
While assets had grown to Rs. 13.8 billion in 1989, the net equity position
worsened to about 87% of the original capital contribution, as a result of the
accumulated  losses.         In  addition,  long-term  debt  had  more  than  doubled,
reflecting  OGDC's  growing  dependence  on  market  borrowing.    However,  OGDC's
investment program was rationalized under the Bank's ESL II Loan (Ln. 3107-PAK)
to emphasize development of previously discovered fields and abdicating, to the
maximum extent possible, exploration investments to the private sector and joint
ventures.   Coupled with the 1990  international crude oil price  increases,  on
which OGDC's pricing is based, OGDC is expected to realize net profits exceeding
Rs. 900 million in 1990. Continued increased production of oil and gas should
enable OGDC to maintain this level of profits in the future.
