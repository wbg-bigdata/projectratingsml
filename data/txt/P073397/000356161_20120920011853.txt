F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objective (PDO) (from the Memorandum and Recommendation of the
President–MOP)1
The objective of the Lower Kihansi Environmental Management Project (LKEMP) is to put in place
a series of measures for the long-term conservation of the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem and upstream
catchment areas. At the national level, the project has the objective of supporting the development of
a coordinated and consistent legal and institutional framework for environmental and water resources
management and strengthening of ecosystem monitoring and assessment functions of environmental
institutions.

Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority)
PDO was not revised.

Key Performance Indicators (as identified)
The Technical Annex of the LKEMP Project Appraisal Document2 identified 11 Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs). As the project was a Technical Assistance project, no Baseline or Target Values
were identified.3 At Additional Financing, a Revised Results Matrix was prepared. The only KPI in
the Technical Annex that was not in the Additional Financing document is the indicator related to the
determination of TANESCO’s Final Water Right. The ICR uses the Revised Results Matrix as the
basis for its analysis of project achievements.

Indicator 1:      Development and implementation of a Kihansi Gorge ecosystem monitoring program,
                  which, among other things, develops technical standards for monitoring flora and fauna

                  Ecological Monitoring database. Given the importance of these data for tracking trends, data entry
                  protocols may need to be reviewed. The Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI) and

                  the following Regulations: (i) Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Audit; (ii) Strategic
                  Environmental Assessment; (iii) Registration of Environmental Experts; and (iv) Compliance and
                  Enforcement. All development activity is subject to EIA and Audit. Large investments in fragile
                  ecosystems are subject to Strategic Environmental Assessment regulations. NEMC receives a
                  minimum of 20 EIAs per day for review and registration of EIA consultants has increased by 60%.
                  Environment was raised to the second highest priority in water allocation decision making in the
                  2002 National Water Policy. The 2009 Water Resources Management Act and associated

                  program, first established in the USA and subsequently in Tanzania. The KST populations are now
                  stable in both places. The Toledo zoo has experienced significantly high level of breeding (8,248
                  new births in 2011) in captivity (Annex 8) and moved some KST to other zoos to reduce costs of
                  maintaining large populations. Experiments on disease transmission from captive-bred KSTs to
                  native amphibians have been successfully completed. KSTs will be reintroduced into the Kihansi
                  Spray Wetlands in January 2012. About 400 KSTs are in captive breeding facilities in Tanzania,
                  and 1,000 are expected to arrive in January for the reintroduction. The rating reflects inherent risks
                  associated with reintroducing an endangered species back into the wild. This risk is however,
                  minimized through careful experimentation, monitoring, advanced knowledge of KST, and the

1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. Tanzania had a population of 32.5 million in mid-1999, of which 32 percent lived in poverty.
GDP in 1999 was US$ 8.8 billion and annual growth of GDP during the period 1999–2003 was
projected at 5.7 percent. The project was in line with priority areas in the National Strategy for
Growth and Reduction of Poverty (better known by its abbreviated name in Kiswahili, MKUKUTA),
the National Environmental Policy (1997), and the National Water Policy (2002). It was also
consistent with the World Bank's Assistance Strategy for Tanzania and with a number of
international conventions to which Tanzania is a party, including the Convention on Biological
Diversity and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

2. In 1993 the “Power VI? or Lower Kihansi Hydropower Plant (LKHP) Project funded
construction of a 180-megawatt hydropower plant located in the Lower Kihansi Gorge on the eastern
escarpment of the Southern Udzungwa Mountains. The LKHP facility, operated by Tanzania Electric
Supply Company (TANESCO), started producing power in December 1999. The project was co-
financed by the European Investment Bank; the Governments of Germany, Norway, and Sweden;
and the World Bank. The LKHP is a run-of-the-river operation, incorporating a 25-meter-high dam
that diverts water into a tunnel which leads to the power generating station. The plant takes
advantage of the change in elevation through the Kihansi Gorge, which drops nearly 900 meters.
Since 2000 LKHP is an integral part of Tanzania’s electric network.

3. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the scientific community raised concerns regarding
the potentially irreversible loss of biodiversity in the Kihansi Gorge due to diversion of large
quantities of water. The Aide Memoire of a joint donor mission (2000) to assess the environmental
situation in the Kihansi Gorge and recommended solutions highlighted the importance of protecting
the Kihansi Spray Toad (KST) and led to an Immediate Rescue and Emergency Measures Project.
That project, supported by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation and Swedish
International Development Cooperation Agency, instituted emergency measures for conserving the
KST and its habitat. The Bank initiated an Environmental Review to investigate the issue and devise
appropriate solutions (World Bank 2000). The review indicated that the LKHP would cause
significant negative impacts to this sensitive ecosystem. The Lower Kihansi Environmental
Management Project (LKEMP) built on the findings of the emergency measures project and the
Bank’s Environmental Review.

The Project Area
4. The Lower Kihansi Gorge is located in the Eastern Arc Mountains, which stretch from
southeastern Kenya through south central Tanzania. The Udzungwa Mountains within this range
contain the greatest area of natural forest in the Eastern Arc and the highest number of endemic and
threatened plant and animal species. The Kihansi River flows through the gorge and plunges over a
series of waterfalls and rapids. The Main Falls at the head of this steep gorge are over 100 meters
high, and the Lower Falls are approximately 30 meters high.

Rationale for Bank Assistance
5. In 1991, Ekono Energy Ltd. of Finland conducted an Environmental Impact Assessment of the
LKHP, which largely focused on upstream impacts of the dam. In 1994, when construction of the
plant was underway, TANESCO and the Electric Power Development Company of Japan conducted

                                                 1
baseline studies. NORAD financed another Environmental Impact Assessment in 1995. The
Immediate Rescue and Emergency Measures Project, supported by Sweden and Norway from 1996
to 2001, concluded that contrary to earlier views, the diversion of water flowing through the gorge to
the power plant was likely to have a significant environmental impact on the downstream
biodiversity on both sides of the 6-kilometer stretch of the river passing through the gorge. The
Bank-funded Environmental Review found a highly contested water allocation issue (a preliminary
water right condition granted by the Rufiji Basin water office that stipulated a minimum
environmental flow of 7m3/s, a recommendation made by the Division of Environment for an
environmental flow of 7.7 m3/s and the decision made by TANESCO to build a bypass flow pipe
with a capacity of releasing 1.5-2.0 m3/s). The review supported the findings from the Immediate
Rescue and Emergency Measures (IREMS), concluding that the diversion of nearly 90% of the water
from Kihansi river flow for LKHP was likely to have: (i) serious negative impacts on species and
habitat; (ii) negative impacts on the microclimate in the gorge ecosystem; (iii) a 91 percent reduction
in the flow of the river; (iv) a 92 percent reduction in spray from the falls; and (v) a decline in KST
numbers (which had fallen from 20,000 to 12,000 by June 2000, according to the baseline studies
over 1994–96). The toad (Nectophrynoides asperginis) was discovered in the Kihansi Gorge in late
1996, formally described as a new species in mid-1998, and listed as critically endangered by the
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The KST has one of the smallest geographic
ranges—approximately 2 hectares—of any tetrapod worldwide. It was considered highly vulnerable
to extinction following the severe alteration of its habitat. As noted, LKEMP was designed in
response to the findings of the Bank’s Environmental Review and the other studies that were done.

1.2 Original Project Development Objective and Key Indicators (as approved)

6. As stated in the Technical Annex of the Memorandum and recommendation of the President
(MOP) and Legal Agreement, the objective of the LKEMP is to put in place a series of measures for
the long-term conservation of the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem and upstream catchment areas. At the
national level, the project had the objective of supporting the development of a coordinated and
consistent legal and institutional framework for environmental and water resources management and
strengthening of ecosystem monitoring and assessment functions of environmental institutions.

7. Table 10 of the Technical Annex to the MOP lists 11 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These
indicators are repeated in the Revised Results Matrix but organized under the PDO and Intermediate
Indicators associated with the project components. The only indicator missing from the Revised
Results Matrix is the one relating to the Final Water Right, which had already been achieved in 2004.
The KPIs are:
    a. Development and implementation of a Kihansi Gorge ecosystem monitoring program, which
        (among other things) develops technical standards for monitoring flora and fauna populations
        in the gorge, evaluates the effectiveness of various mitigation measures already under
        implementation, and recommends new mitigation measures as needed.
    b. Development and implementation of measures to improve the conservation status of the
        Kihansi Gorge ecosystem and to restore critical habitats where this is possible and cost-
        effective.
    c. Establishment of the criteria and the mechanisms for reintroducing threatened endemic
        species to the Kihansi Gorge or to other appropriate habitats.
    d. Preparation of a Landscape Wide Conservation and Catchment Area Management Plan,
        which considers upstream catchment protection and its impact on the Kihansi Gorge.



                                                  2
   e. Strengthening the capacity and the institutional basis for conserving threatened habitats and
      species in Tanzania and for training future researchers, natural resource managers, and
      decision makers in conservation biology.
   f. Determination of TANESCO's final right to use water from the Kihansi River through a
      transparent process and on the basis of scientific inputs and representations from various
      stakeholders.
   g. Establishment and implementation of a framework for monitoring and enforcing compliance
      with the Final Water Right.
   h. Preparation of an updated Environmental Management Plan (EMP), which is to be
      implemented as a condition of the Final Water Right and which accounts for threatened
      endemic species in the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem.
   i. Finalization and dissemination of proposed national environmental impact assessment
      guidelines.
   j. Prioritizing and addressing capacity-building needs, identified as a result of a capacity needs
      assessment, with respect to environmental decision making specific to the question of water
      resources and the environment.
   k. Strengthening the institutional and regulatory framework for environmental management, in
      particular by improving the capacity for implementing Environmental Impact Assessment
      regulations and for monitoring, regulating, and enforcing legal provisions related to
      environmental quality objectives.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

8. The PDO was not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9. A large number of national agencies, including the Division of Environment, Vice President’s
Office, Ministries of Water and Energy and Minerals, National Environment Management Council
(NEMC), Rufiji Basin Water Office (RBWO), Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA), TANESCO,
Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI), and University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM)
benefitted from the project. The support included technical assistance for policy formulation,
legislation and regulatory development, ecological monitoring, disease diagnosis and control, captive
breeding of KSTs, determination and monitoring of a Water Right, hydrological monitoring, and
related skills. Some communities in the upper and lower catchments of the Kihansi river, received
some grants for livelihoods as part of implementing the EMP.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1 (US$ 2.23 million): Habitat and Species Conservation and Management
10. This component aimed to: (a) develop and implement an ecosystem monitoring and conservation
program; (b) support species conservation and captive breeding efforts; (c) develop national capacity
for managing the monitoring and conservation program; and (d) develop and implement a Landscape
Wide Conservation Plan.

Component 2 (US$ 0.59 million): Enforcement of the Water Right
11. This component aimed to put in place: (a) a transparent process to establish TANESCO’s Final
Water Rights for operation of the Kihansi facility; (b) mechanisms for data collection for calibrating
                                                  3
a hydrological model for operating the LKHP; and (c) capacity in NEMC and RBWO to carry out
effective monitoring and enforcement of the Final Water Right.

Component 3 (US$ 1.15 million): Updating the Environmental Management Plan
12. This component aimed to (a) develop an updated EMP, which was to be implemented as a
condition of the Final Water Right to be granted to TANESCO.

Component 4 (US$ 1.25 million): Institutional Strengthening
13. The component aimed to (a) support the preparation and implementation of an institutional
capacity building program for environmental and water resources management, including
environmental regulation, monitoring, and enforcement.

1.6 Revised Components

14. The components were not revised. In 2007, Additional Financing in the amount of US$ 3.5
million was requested by the Government of Tanzania to support specific activities under the
different components. The changes were:
     Component 1 (US$ 2.1million): (a) KST captive breeding efforts; (b) developing
        monitoring protocols for the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem; (c) reintroduction of the KST; and (d)
        strengthening capacity of institutions to teach and do research in conservation biology.
     Component 2 (US$ 0.10million): (a) monitoring and enforcement of Final Water Rights; (b)
        establish bypass releases; and (c) data collection for hydrological model to support operations
        of the power facility.
     Component 3 (US$ (0.10million): (a) development and implementation of an updated EMP
        to specify conditions requiring compliance by TANESCO in order to operate the hydropower
        facility.
     Component 4 (US$ 1.20million): (a) strengthen local capacity for environmental and water
        resources management.

1.7 Other significant changes

15. No other changes were made.

1.8 Rationale for Additional Financing Phase of the Project

16. The government requested Additional Financing of US$ 3.5 million to fill a financing gap caused
by unexpected issues, including: (i) mortality in the captive-bred KSTs; (ii) prevalence of chytrid
fungus and invasive plant species in the Kihansi Gorge; and (iii) declining water quality resulting
from increased sediment loads and persistent toxic substances. The Additional Financing enabled the
government to support the stabilization of the KST population and implement a reintroduction
program. Direct involvement of multiple agencies in implementing the project activities was critical
given the remoteness of the location and the need for capacity building. Community grants were
provided as part of the implementation of the EMP, to reduce sedimentation and pollution of the
Kihansi river through farming activities on the river banks. Overall, the Additional Financing
supported technical assistance, training and implementation support.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Background analysis
17. The background analysis supporting the concept for the project was thorough. The design took
into account the findings of a series of baseline studies supported by TANESCO, the Immediate
Rescue and Emergency Measures Project, and the Bank-funded Environmental Review of 2000 to
identify the scale and scope of measures required to address the negative impacts resulting from
LKHP. The design also took into consideration scientific input, input from global environmental
organizations, and contributions from a range of national stakeholders. The international stakeholders
communicated their concerns to the Bank leadership, while national stakeholders communicated
concerns through the Vice President’s Office and the media. The design stage for the project was
supervised by a high-level Internal Advisory Panel, whose members were responsible for quality
assurance and adherence to Bank safeguards and other policies regarding biodiversity and dam
development. The design of the project is basically that of an EMP that integrates the findings of the
Bank-supported Environmental Review. Quality at Entry was ensured by the Internal Advisory Panel,
which met once a month to review preparation and emerging issues.

Lessons reflected in the project’s design
18. A few lessons could be incorporated into the project’s design, but the impacts and circumstances
that required a response were unique. They involved a highly contested water right, an endangered
species, compliance with the Bank’s safeguard policies, and the many interest groups demanding
appropriate action by the Bank. Key lessons reflected in the LKEMP design include:
    a. Given the unique situation, the uncertainties involved in allocating water for power
        generation and ecosystem, restoring an ecosystem, and the high risk that an endangered
        species would become extinct, the project’s design focused on putting a legal and
        institutional framework and short-term measures in place for preventing the collapse of the
        species and ecosystem.
    b. Considering the low level of information on the ecosystem, habitat, and KST, as well as
        weaknesses in capacity and the legal and institutional structures for environmental
        management, the project design adopted a conservative approach in crafting the PDO and
        indicators.
    c. The lending instrument selected was a Technical Assistance project, which allowed for an
        adaptive management approach that would make it possible to internalize additional
        knowledge as it became available and to modify activities.
    d. Due to lack of prior experience it was necessary to mobilize external scientific partnerships to
        provide assistance with captive breeding, disease control, and reintroduction.

Quality at Entry
19. The project was designed as an emergency response to a challenging environmental situation in
the Kihansi Gorge, caused by impacts from a previous project financed by the Bank and its partners.
As such, no quality assessment was required at project inception. However, the design stage was
supervised by the Internal Advisory Panel, as noted, to ensure quality and observance of the
Environmental Review and Bank guidelines on environment, water, dams, and biodiversity. The
Internal Advisory Panel met monthly to review preparation documents and provide guidance on
design as well as compliance with the Bank’s safeguard and other policies.


                                                  5
Assessment of risks
20. The main risks assessed at design stage were scientific uncertainty and political risk. These risks
remain but are reduced due to more advanced knowledge regarding KST and disease factors and
greater awareness of environmental and conservation issues in the country. Scientific uncertainty was
related to the degree of success in preventing irreversible change and degradation in the Kihansi
Gorge, the potential for the KST’s extinction in the gorge, and the risk of captive breeding, which
would involve translocation of the toads. The major political risk was the trade-offs between
allowing a bypass flow for conservation and reducing the in-flow to the power plant and lowering
productivity of the hydropower facility. The issue was the decision to support captive breeding of
KSTs outside the country (which was a concern because of the potential genetic values that could be
lost to Tanzania). These risks were addressed at the management level in the Bank, and negotiations
with the government and partners were led by the Country Director for Tanzania at that time.

21. The absence of precedents for allocating water for ecosystem needs pitted the environmental and
water resources agencies (NEMC, RBWO and Division of Environment) on one side of the debate
and the developer (TANESCO) on the other side. Borrowing to restore a habitat or to save an
endangered species was unheard of and politically unattractive in a country where a considerable
share of the population lived in poverty and with less than 15% of the population having access to
electricity. Electricity was an engine of growth and maintaining productivity was critical. Awareness
of endangered species, threatened habitats, and the IUCN’s Red List was low. Most high-level policy
makers were of the view that the global significance of the KST indicated that the global community
should pay to conserve the species and its habitat. The RBWO, the water regulator for the basin,
remained steadfast in following the principles of sound water management despite enormous political
pressure. Environmental legislation was delayed for more than a decade due to the view of most
policymakers that legislation on environmental management and impact assessment would be anti-
development. The project was initiated in a challenging political and socioeconomic climate. Once
the project got underway, commitment in all agencies increased remarkably.

With greater government support, the project was able to put into place a number of policy,
regulatory, and institutional mechanisms, including: (i) determination of the Final Water Right for
TANESCO and its enforcement; (ii) formulation and adoption by Parliament of the Environmental
Management Act and a series of Regulations, including the Environmental Impact and Audit
Regulations; (iii) a contribution to the National Water Policy, which recognized the environment as a
user of water; (iv) successful captive breeding of KSTs in Tanzania and the United States; (v)
establishment of an ecological data base and protocols; and (vi) skills development in a range of
subject areas.

2.2. Mid-term Review
22. A joint International Development Association (IDA) and Government of Tanzania team
conducted a Mid-Term Review from May 17 to May 28, 2004. The review concluded that the project
was on track and rated the achievement of most KPIs at 100 percent or 80 percent. Of the two legal
covenants, the updated EMP was developed by April 2004. The other covenant, related to the Water
Right, was achieved in June 2004. Issues noted by the review team were the possible extinction of
KSTs in the wild, and a captive breeding program in the United States. All of these issues were
addressed during the second half of the project.




                                                  6
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization

23. The recommendations in the Environmental Review were the basis for developing KPIs for
tracking progress under LKEMP. Responsibility for tracking progress was placed on the Project
Coordinator housed in NEMC, who coordinate with implementing agencies to gather data on
progress achieved against specific indicators. The performance indicators identified were linked
directly to activities recommended by the Environmental Review. Subsequently, during the
Additional Financing, those indicators were incorporated into a Revised Results Framework Matrix,
linking the key indicators with the PDO and other intermediate outcome indicators with the
components.

24. This project was endorsed in 2001. At the time it was designed, the Bank did not have the same
approach as it does now, to measuring results. However, a number of monitoring tools were used in
LKEMP. The KPIs were tracked by the Project Coordinator in liaison with the implementing
agencies, as noted. Monitoring reports were reviewed every quarter by the Multisectoral Technical
Advisory Committee and recommendations were provided on issues arising from the reports. These
were taken up in the six-monthly Joint Supervision Missions, which determined the way forward.

25. The development and establishment of the Ecological Monitoring Protocols and Data Base
formed a key output of LKEMP. NEMC, UDSM, and TAWIRI performed the monitoring of
indicators in the Ecological Monitoring Protocols, which are referred to as the “Gibbs Protocols?.
Further details regarding these Protocols are provided in Annex 8. The protocols were used to track
progress on all ecological indicators and trends in the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem.

26. RWBO collected data on bypass flow and other water issues in compliance with the special
conditions of the Final Water Right. TANESCO provided dam inflow and release data to RWBO,
and RWBO conducted independent monitoring at its own stations.

27. Progress in implementing the EMP, which is also a monitoring tool, was tracked by a number of
participating agencies, including NEMC, RWBO, TANESCO, and UDSM. Intensive supervision by
the Bank and Government of Tanzania—particularly of the key areas for monitoring the KST,
Kihansi Gorge, and compliance with the Water Right—appear to have worked well in monitoring
progress of the PDO and components.

Issues
28. The government noted the absence of an integrated monitoring and evaluation system that would
track data related to financial management, procurement, ecology, species, water resources, and
environment. This would have been useful to assess trends and develop a follow-on project. Some
issues with regard to data entry for the Ecological Data Base are currently being resolved as the data
base is transferred to TAWIRI for management.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental and social safeguards
Rating: Satisfactory

29. The core tool developed through LKEMP is the updated EMP designed to address the negative
impacts from the Lower Kihansi Hydropower Plant. LKEMP is categorized as Category C with
respect to the Bank’s safeguard policies. Achievements with regard to environmental safeguards
                                                  7
include: (i) development, enactment, and enforcement of the Environmental Management Act and
related regulations; (ii) determination and enforcement of a Final Water Right for TANESCO; (iii)
completion and enforcement of an Environmental Audit; (iv) capacity developed in NEMC and the
Division of Environment (Vice President’s Office) to review Environmental Impact Assessments and
enforce compliance; and (v) development of guidelines on Strategic Environmental Assessment.
Compliance with environmental safeguards in the LKEMP is rated satisfactory.

30. LKEMP is fundamentally a Technical Assistance project. For that reason, it undertook no
physical activities that could lead to resettlement.

Fiduciary compliance
Rating: Satisfactory
                                                                                  5
31. The procurement of civil works, goods, equipment, non-consultancy, and consultancy services is
considered satisfactory. All civil works were completed and all goods and equipment delivered on
time. Due to the nature of the project (Technical Assistance), procurement focused on consultancy
services, all of which were all delivered on time. Internal procurement processes at NEMC were
adequate and adjudication for award of contracts by the Tender Board were done in timely manner.
No delays were observed in the processing of tenders, and stakeholders consulted during the
workshop on November 11, 2011 mentioned the Bank’s timely response, including clarifications on
questions. The project supported training for the Procurement Specialist and Head of the
Procurement Unit. Members of the Tender Board also gained exposure to the Bank’s procurement
processes. The quality of the documentation is assessed as satisfactory, as is the internal system.

32. NEMC’s performance in financial management was also satisfactory. The budgeting process was
assessed to be adequate, based on the agreed annual work program and annual procurement plan
approved by the Bank. Budgets were prepared using the government’s Medium Term Expenditure
Framework format. NEMC’s accounting was based on a well-established system, which was
reviewed and found adequate for handling the project’s financial transactions. Personnel of the
Accounting Unit were trained in the Bank’s fiduciary systems. Internal Controls procedures in
NEMC’s accounting manual were reviewed and found satisfactory, with adequate segregation of
duties. NEMC has an Internal Audit Department consisting of one person, who is well experienced
and qualified. Unaudited Interim Financial Reports were prepared on a quarterly basis and reviewed
by the Bank. They were submitted within the set time frame and have been of satisfactory quality. In
addition, external audit reports were unqualified, with prompt follow-up of Bank recommendations
for most of the project’s life. One area of weakness was counterpart funding, which was delayed or
less in some years, but these shortfalls were always fully recovered.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

33. Upon closure of LKEMP, all project activities have been mainstreamed within the various
government departments. TANESCO has mainstreamed EMP implementation within their
operational work program and in FY 2011 it has mobilized US$ 578,000 for its implementation:
US$ 110,000 from TANESCO itself, US$ 205,000 from the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, and
US$ 263,000 from the Tanzania Energy Development and Access Project (TEDAP). In the Ministry

5 Nonconsultancy services include support for formulating policy and legislation, which involves workshops for
dialogue and negotiation.

                                                        8
of Natural Resources and Tourism, the Wildlife Division has already allocated a total of
US$ 112,500 for this fiscal year and the next. The wildlife research institute (TAWIRI) is scheduled
to take over management of the ecological data base and the Environmental Center in the Kihansi
Gorge. NEMC and RBWO are managing the work with their operational budgets, however, which
support all activities managed by these agencies. GoT is seeking support from the Global
Environmental Facility to finance a conservation program that covers the entire Kihansi Gorge
ecosystem and the conservation of multi-species towards achieving holistic global conservation
benefits.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory

34. The PDO remains highly relevant to the Tanzania’s “National Strategy for Growth and Reduction
of Poverty? and the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY12-15, all of which include environmental
sustainability and enhancement management of natural resources. The priorities that the project
sought to address also remain relevant, primarily given the national and local importance of
establishment of environmental and water resources management frameworks. The legal and
institutional framework for environmental management and water resources management were
relevant at the inception of the project and remain relevant in the context of increased use and
dependence on environmental and water resources. The relevance also remains high, with regard to
the conservation of biodiversity in the Kihansi gorge and preventing the extinction of an endangered
species. Tanzania is a signatory to the International Convention on Biodiversity Conservation and
obliged to conserve biodiversity and in particular, endangered species. The relevance remains high to
build capacity at the national level to manage competing needs in the gorge as well as in similar
projects that may arise. The capacity building has enabled the GoT to prioritize the issues and to
mainstream activities within its agencies to ensure sustainability of the PDO. The relevance is high,
given the need to address negative environmental impacts identified by the Bank and its partners in
connection with LKHP. The relevance is high given the need to respond to the Environmental
Review conducted by the Bank to develop a mitigation program. The project has reached beyond
mitigation into the establishment of a credible regulatory regime which will yield far reaching
benefits for the country.

The project design basically resembles an EMP to address the negative impacts identified by the
Environmental Review. However, it also incorporates important legal and institutional policy,
legislative and institutional reform for environmental and water resources management. These
reforms have significant benefits in promoting development that is sustainable and minimizing
conflicts between user groups. Innovative features such as environmental flows and recognition of
environment as a user of water are incorporated within the Water Policy through the contributions
and influence of this project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Efficacy)
Rating: Satisfactory

The first part of the PDO refers to the establishment of a series of measures for the long-term
conservation of the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem and its upstream catchment areas. This objective was
fully achieved by the determination and enforcement of the by-pass flow into the Gorge,

                                                 9
establishment of a sprinkler system, and the development and implementation of a monitoring
program with technical standards for monitoring flora and fauna populations. The Ecological
Monitoring Program and Protocols that were established are used by a number of agencies, including
NEMC, TAWIRI, UDSM, and RWBO. Capacity was built in data gathering, data entry, data base
management, monitoring, and enforcement.. Finally, the KST population in the gorge was monitored
before its decline, and the habitat is currently being monitored closely in preparation for the toad’s
reintroduction. The by-pass flow is enforced by RBWO as a condition of the Water Right and
TANESCO maintains the sprinkler system. These measures have been successful in restoring the
spray wetlands to a level of 90.3% relative to pre-dam commissioning.

35. The second part of the PDO relates to supporting the development of a coordinated and
consistent legal and institutional framework for: (a) environmental and water resources management
and (b) strengthening of ecosystem monitoring and assessment functions of environmental
institutions at the national level. This part of the PDO has also been substantially achieved. The
related indicator is: “a Legal framework for the management of the environment and water resources
management established and enforced.? LKEMP provided support for preparing an Environmental
Management Act (enacted in 2004), along with a series of important regulations, including the
Environmental Impact Assessment and Audit Regulation (2005); Strategic Environmental
Assessments regulation; Environmental Experts and Guidelines Regulation; Regulation on Fees and
Charges (2008); Regulations on Environmental Quality Standards (2007); and Compliance and
Enforcement guidelines for NEMC. Currently all investments are subject to the Environmental
Impact Assessment and Audit Regulation.

36. Capacity has been built in NEMC and the Vice President’s Office to review Environmental
Impact Assessments, and require mitigation. NEMC receives a minimum of 20 Environmental
Impact Assessments for review per day and LKEMP was audited in 2011 under the Environmental
Impact Assessment and Audit Regulations. Strategic Environmental Assessments are required where
development activity is carried out in sensitive ecosystems. LKEMP also contributed to the inclusion
of innovative provisions regarding the allocation of water for the environment in the 2002 National
Water Policy, which is considered by IUCN and within the Bank as very progressive from an
environmental perspective. Finally, based on LKEMP experience, the GoT enacted the Water
Resources Management Act and associated regulations in 2009 which provided the legal basis for
implementing the National Water Policy. Four environmental flow assessments have been carried out.
A strong policy and legal foundation is now in place to integrate environmental flow requirements in
decisions related to water allocation. There is also greater coordination between the environmental
and water resources management frameworks, given that the environment is recognized as a user of
water. Hydropower, irrigation, and other investments using water are required to adhere to the
Environmental Impact Assessment and Audit Regulations. The project has thus, made a very
significant contribution to a regulatory regime for environmental and water resources management,
which are already realizing benefits beyond this project.

37. With regard to strengthening ecosystem monitoring and assessment at the national level, skills
were enhanced in a range of national institutions with support from LKEMP, including NEMC,
RWBO, SUA, TANESCO, TAWIRI, and UDSM. Capacity was built at UDSM and the Wildlife
Division to monitor and manage the captive breeding facilities, the captive breeding program, and the
reintroduction program. RWBO received training to monitor and enforce compliance with the Final
Water Right. TANESCO received training in monitoring and implementation of the EMP. NEMC
also received training in the monitoring of Environmental Impact Assessments and EMPs and in
developing Strategic Environmental Assessment guidelines for sensitive ecosystems. Currently all
                                                 10
these agencies are using the skills obtained in this project and in related activities. Shortcomings
currently being addressed include challenges in data entry into the ecological data base. The data
entry forms are being reviewed for simplification prior to transfer of the data base to TAWIRI.

38. A third outcome indicator was added under Additional Financing: “Key species in the Kihansi
Gorge and habitat sustainably maintained.? This indicator has also been substantially achieved.
Supervision reports observe that of the total 11,747 m2 of spray wetlands, 10,619 m2 or 90.3%
have been restored in the Upper and Lower Spray wetlands (Newmark, W.). Annex 8 provides
additional information on the decline of invasive overstory species and the increase in understory
species. This achievement, which is particularly relevant because these two wetlands historically
contained historically over 95 percent of the KST population, results from: (i) the bypass flow and
compliance by TANESCO of the Final Water Right; (ii) the joint operation of the primary and back-
up sprinkler system, which increased the volume of spray; (iii) walkways, bridges, and other
measures to reduce the impact of human movement on spray wetland vegetation; and (iv)
repositioning spray jets to improve the height and volume of water levels.

Efficiency
Rating: Achieved with a few shortcomings
39. LKEMP was designed as a Technical Assistance project that would build institutional, legal, and
regulatory capacity to mitigate environmental impacts resulting from a previous World Bank
investment. As such, it was not considered necessary to carry out an economic and financial analysis
or determine the economic rate of return. At the project’s close, it is not possible to calculate rates of
return because most outputs are too complex to be quantified, and many outcomes will be realized
only over the long term. Additionally, this project is a remedial program and standard cost benefit
analysis would not apply in this situation. In most Technical Assistance projects Efficiency is not
rated.

40. LKEMP is a relatively small project incurring a total cost of US$ 9.5 million over a ten year
period. Of the US$9.5million, US$ 3.5 million was mobilized as Additional Financing, implemented
over an additional three years. This additional cost and time was not anticipated at project inception,
but was required to address the unanticipated mortality of KSTs in the gorge, the issue of the chytrid
fungus, and to support additional captive breeding. The reintroduction of KSTs required more time
and research to develop a stable population, conduct experiments, and ensure a suitable habitat for
reentry. The updated EMP for LKHP has estimated annual incremental costs of US$ 562,700 for
mitigation and monitoring programs. Given these estimates, US$ 1 million per year to implement an
environmental management program, achieve important policy, legal, institutional, and regulatory
reforms, prevent the extinction of an endangered species and restore a valuable ecosystem
demonstrates efficient use of resources.

41. The PDO took longer than expected to achieve due to the unanticipated challenges described
above. A greater part of the funds went to consultants and incremental costs to facilitate: scientific
research in habitat restoration and conservation of endangered species; access to the remote location
of Kihansi Gorge; and the involvement of a large number of institutions in monitoring the Kihansi
Gorge and its species. Some of these costs may have been categorized training, given that ecological
monitoring at the site was largely enhancing capacity of the national experts.

The project yielded both site specific, national and global benefits, stemming mainly from putting in
place a comprehensive environmental management framework and a water resources framework.

                                                   11
These regulatory regimes will help GoT avoid future costs of degradation in sensitive ecosystems.
Additionally the project prevented the extinction of an endangered species and supported the
restoration of a valuable ecosystem.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

42. The PDO was and remains relevant as discussed above. It is in line with the MKUKUTA,
the Environmental Policy, the Water Policy, the Tanzania Assistance Strategy, the Convention
on Biological Diversity, and Bank safeguard policies. Although delayed in some respects, due to
unanticipated developments regarding the endangered species, the project substantially
achieved the PDO and KPIs. Efficiency is achieved with a few shortcomings, relevance is high and
achievement is satisfactory. The overall outcome rating is thus, satisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

43. With respect to poverty, the project had no explicit poverty reduction goal. The project has made
a marginal impact through some small grants to communities in the Upper and Lower catchment as
part of the implementation of the EMP. The small grants amounting to US$196,000 were allocated
to support alternative livelihoods to move away from farming near the Kihansi river. Most of these
projects are successful in improving incomes. A few projects have environmental objectives such as
catchment management. These projects, such as afforestation, will provide dual benefits of reduced
poverty and improved water quality.

44. With respect to gender, the project did not explicitly focus on gender, but men and women both
benefitted under the Landscape Wide Conservation and Catchment Area Management Plan
mentioned previously. They also benefited from capacity-building programs at the national level.

45. With respect to social development, the project did not have an explicit focus.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

46. Institutional change as a result of the project is positive and noteworthy. The range of
achievements include the development and enforcement of environmental and water resources
management frameworks and the development of capacity in a large number of institutions, such as
NEMC, RBWO, SUA, TANESCO, UDSM, the Vice President’s Office, and the Wildlife Division.
Capacity development was integral to achieving the PDO, and the comprehensive program of
activities was highly visible, both nationally and globally. The institutional changes brought about
through the project were politically and socially challenging. Environmental Impact Assessments,
Environmental Audits, Strategic Environmental Assessment, and the EMP as mechanisms for
managing environmental impact were not in place prior to the project. Such instruments were
generally considered as anti-development initiatives. The new concepts of environmental flows and
permits for water users were internalized into the Water Policy with project support. The
determination of the Water Right is one example that is endorsed and enforced. LKEMP was
subjected to an Environmental Audit, and Environmental Impact Assessments are required for all
developmental activities. NEMC receives an average of 20 Environmental Impact Assessments each
day, and Strategic Environmental Assessment guidelines are under development. Capacity has also
                                                  12
been built in amphibian microbiology, pathology, disease diagnosis, chytrid fungus management, and
captive breeding. Partners in the United States speak highly of the abilities of UDSM and SUA
faculty and staff in mastering new fields with speed and agility. The valuable laboratory equipment
provided to the microbiology/pathology laboratories at SUA and UDSM has uses wider than the
diagnosis and control of amphibian diseases.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

47. Prior to LKEMP, the scientific community and larger environmental and biodiversity
communities knew little about the KST. This project considerably expanded the knowledge base on
subjects ranging from captive breeding, disease control, chytrid fungus control and treatment, habitat
management, species reintroduction, and the KST itself. The knowledge was built through
experimentation and crisis. This knowledge can be replicated in other rivers and watersheds around
the world. Other important knowledge was developed on environmental flows, valuation of water,
maintenance of bypass flows, impact of bypass flows, and the costs of internalizing environmental
impacts. Some of these lessons have been published by the Bank’s Environment Department.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

48. Participants in a stakeholder workshop on November 11, 2011 discussed the preliminary findings
of the ICR. Technical representatives from almost all participating agencies attended. They reviewed
the accomplishment of the PDO at project closure, discussed actual values achieved at completion,
and discussed the intermediate outcome indicators. The ratings elicited a high degree of interest and
significant contributions to justify changes in particular ratings. Important themes of relevance,
achievement of the PDO, efficiency, sustainability, government and other stakeholder commitment,
and government and Bank performance were also discussed. Recommendations were made regarding
mainstreaming, simplifying the Ecological Monitoring Data Base, and the process of handing over
the data base, Environmental Center, and staff to TAWIRI. Details are provided in Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.1 Risk to Ecological Sustainability
Rating: Low

49. At start-up, the risks related to irreversible degradation of the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem and its
species were identified. While the project responded to the findings of the Environmental Review
and other studies, there was significant uncertainty as to whether the habitat and species would
regenerate. Given that a preponderance of scientists thought it possible to overcome the risks, the
project was prepared. While multiple habitats and plant and animal species in the gorge faced
increasing threats from the reduced flow of water through the gorge, the most vulnerable habitats and
species in the short term were the wetland spray meadows and KST, on which the project focused.
Once the project was under implementation, the toads experienced unexpected mortality in the gorge
and captivity. Unanticipated resources and time were spent to diagnose the problems and implement
the reintroduction plan. At project closure, those threats had been overcome, and a vast amount of
knowledge was gained about the habitat and species in the process.




                                                 13
50. The achievements over the ten years of the project are: (i) restoring the Kihansi Spray Wetlands
by 90 percent; (ii) establishing of a legal and regulatory framework and institutional mechanisms for
environment, water resources and habitat management; (iii) updating and implementing the updated
EMP, which provides a framework for institutions to monitor and implement measures for the long-
term viability of the ecosystem; (iv) preventing extinction of a rare and endangered species; (v)
developing and implementing a reintroduction plan for the KST; (vi) increasing disease control
capability and advancing knowledge in controlling chytrid fungus; (vii) developing protocols for
reintroduction; and (viii) enhancing capacity in conservation biology, KST reintroduction, amphibian
disease diagnosis and control, chytrid fungus monitoring and control, and biosecurity and long-term
storage of amphibian pathogens. TANESCO is legally bound to maintain the by-pass flow as a
condition of the FWR. TANESCO also maintains the sprinkler systems as part of implementing the
EMP. TANESCO has mobilized funds from three sources (its own budget, the Ministry of Energy
and Mines, and the TEDAP) to implement the EMP, which includes reintroducing the KST and
maintaining the artificial spray. This is an indication of commitment to the program. The risk to
ecological sustainability is rated low.

The risk that the re-introduced KST may not survive is minimized because of the advanced
knowledge of KST and disease factors, improved capacity in the country to monitor, successful
experiments in the country on disease transmission, and the existence of a ‘KST Bank’ in country
and in the USA.

4.2 Risk to Financial Sustainability
Rating: Moderate

51. Financial Sustainability is rated moderate. Financial management arrangements have been found
adequate in terms of budgeting, staffing, accounting systems, accounting policies and procedures,
record keeping, financial reporting, internal control systems, internal and external auditing
arrangements, and flow of funds. As of April 2011, the government had released TSh 165 million,
about 60 percent, of the budgeted project counterpart funds for FY 2010/11. At project closure, all
implementing agencies have committed to mainstreaming LKEMP activities within their own work
plans. They have developed budgets that have been mainstreamed into annual budgets and work
plans. The Department of Wildlife has released US$ 120,000 for this fiscal year and committed an
additional US$ 120,000 for FY 2011/12. TANESCO has mainstreamed the EMP within its
operations and mobilized US$ 778,000 from its budget, the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and
TEDAP. The rating reflects the fact that at the time of writing, NEMC, RBWO, SUA, and UDSM
have resource constraints to carry out their respective functions efficiently. The government is
seeking external financing to support LKEMP activities and has initiated a process to access Global
Environment Facility funding under the biodiversity window.

4.3 Risk to Institutional Sustainability
Rating: Low

A large number of institutions were involved in implementing LKEMP and developed working
modalities to implement project activities in a collaborative manner. Major legal, regulatory, and
enforcement measures, such as the Environmental Management Act and regulations, Water Policy
reform, and protocols for restoring the Kihansi Gorge were formulated, enacted by Parliament and
enforced. The Final Water Right for TANESCO along with sprinkler systems were successful in the
restoration of the spray wetlands.. TANESCO has mainstreamed the updated EMP into its own work

                                                 14
program and mobilized resources for its implementation. TANESCO regularly collects hydrological
data and data on the by-pass. RWBO maintains 11 monitoring stations and monitors the by-pass flow
and the spray wetlands. The Ecological Data Base and Captive Breeding Center were maintained by
NEMC. They are being transferred to TAWIRI in the Post-LKEMP phase. The Wildlife Division,
TANESCO, RWBO all have mobilized resources to continue LKEMP activities. GoT is seeking
additional funding from GEF for a project which will focus on multi-species, within the Udzungwa
mountains. The risk to institutional sustainability is rated low.

4.4 Government and Other Stakeholder Ownership and Commitment Risk
Rating: Low

52. The risk of diminishing commitment on the part of the government and other stakeholders is
rated low for the following reasons. The commitment of the government and other stakeholders at the
national level increased remarkably during implementation (the government requested Additional
Financing in an amount of US$ 3.5 million to expand activities related to restoring the gorge habitat
and reintroducing the KST). Key stakeholders demonstrated a high level of ownership throughout
implementation, and high-level officials were involved in the Steering Committee. LKEMP activities
are now mainstreamed into the work plans and budgets of the implementing agencies, some of which
have successfully mobilized resources to support implementation. TANESCO has mainstreamed the
EMP into its work programs and mobilized resources for its implementation. NEMC and RBWO
have yet to marshal additional resources to carry out their responsibilities, however. Given that the
maintenance of the Environmental Center and ecological data base are being transferred to TAWIRI,
NEMC will be able manage its tasks with normal operational budgets. RBWO also indicated that
they would continue their responsibilities using their operational budgets.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

53. Bank performance in ensuring quality at Entry is rated satisfactory. The scope of negative
environmental impacts from diverting the Kihansi River was not anticipated when the LKHP was
designed. The proactive support for LKEMP and for the Government of Tanzania to comply with
international obligations and institute environmental and water resources management frameworks at
the national level demonstrated the Bank’s commitment to respond to the situation in a
comprehensive manner. The design internalized the findings of baseline work, the Immediate Rescue
and Emergency Measures Project, contributions of environmental NGOs, the scientific community,
the Environmental Review, and recommendations from the Internal Advisory Panel. The Country
Director for Tanzania at the time provided leadership in the dialogue with the government on such
difficult issues as the income and productivity lost by enforcing a bypass flow and the potential loss
of genetic resources by moving KSTs overseas for captive breeding. By designing LKEMP as a
Technical Assistance project, the team maintained sufficient flexibility to add to, or modify activities
in response to unexpected developments.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

                                                  15
54. The satisfactory rating is based on a number of factors. While the design was similar to standard
EMP, the complexities became obvious in implementation. The Bank team responded with proactive
supervision, including two to four field supervisions each year. World-class expertise was retained on
the supervision team for amphibians and water resources management, and consistent efforts were
made to maintain links within the government and with external partners, including IUCN and
United States zoos and universities. The emphasis on task management in the field made it possible
to be near all implementing agencies, and the adaptive management approach made it possible to
address unexpected issues in implementing the captive breeding program and take proactive steps to
manage the spread of chytrid fungus. The Additional Financing was leveraged in a timely manner to
maintain the gorge ecosystem and reintroduce KSTs into their original habitat. Finally, supervision
also helped to maintain a strong focus on the sustainability of the outcomes, provide timely input on
all aspects of implementation (including fiduciary elements), and promote consistent support for
capacity building and knowledge transfer for national institutions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

55. In addition to the ratings discussed previously, an overall performance rating of satisfactory is
justified on the following grounds. First, the task team responded to the unexpected environmental
disaster with dedication, despite the difficult political context, scientific uncertainty, other pressures,
and risks. Second, management provided a high level of support to the team to craft the best possible
design in a timely manner. The quality of supervision benefitted from continued expert support and
management advice, and the team successfully mobilized and maintained important internal and
external partnerships.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

56. The Borrower’s performance is rated satisfactory on the basis of its steady commitment to and
ownership of a challenging program that posed serious political and economic risks. At the beginning
of the project, many policy makers were not supportive of borrowing to restore a habitat and species
and establish a captive breeding program for a rare indigenous species in the United States (with the
concomitant concern over the loss of genetic material). They were not uniformly supportive of
creating the bypass flow, which would reduce productivity and revenue, or of enacting difficult and
comprehensive environmental legislation and policy reform in the water sector. Other challenging
issues included scaling up LKEMP activities and borrowing under the second phase to respond to the
unexpected problems with KSTs, mainstreaming LKEMP activities within the government’s budget
and work plans, and supporting significant capacity building for a number of national agencies.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

57. The main implementing agencies, coordinated through NEMC, also performed with dedication
and commitment under challenging circumstances. The achievement of all KPIs is evidence of this
performance, particularly because some KPIs entailed politically challenging processes, such as the
determination of Final Water Right and the enactment of laws and regulations in an environment
where policy makers were not initially supportive of certain aspects of the project. Given the major

                                                    16
accomplishments in legal and institutional reform and the achievement of all KPIs, the rating of
satisfactory is justified. Despite the absence of performance benchmarks, the Multisectoral Steering
Committee and Multisectoral Technical Advisory Committee routinely monitored the project’s
progress and provided guidance to achieve important policy and legislative reforms.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

58. The satisfactory rating reflects positive performance at different levels of government. Other
aspects taken into consideration in determining the rating were: (i) the low levels of understanding
and capacity prevailing at the beginning of the project in relation to biodiversity, ecosystem values,
and environmental flows; (ii) the continued support for the bypass flow during periods of serious
power shortages; and (iii) continued commitment of all implementing agencies toward this project
and its goals.

6. Lessons Learned
59. The project, owing to its innovative nature, offers a number of lessons for future efforts. A
fundamental lesson is not to ignore downstream impacts when large infrastructure or hydropower
projects are undertaken in sensitive ecosystems. A proper environmental flow assessment as part of
an EIA and adequate environmental flows as mitigation measures are essential for projects in
sensitive ecosystems.

60. A related lesson is in large infrastructure or hydropower projects, specific EIA needs to be very
thorough and the results of the EIA need to be incorporated into the implementation of the project
and form part of its project costs.

61. It is good practice for the Bank to support development of improved EIA legislation and capacity
as part of implementation of infrastructure or hydropower projects. When the alarm was raised about
the potential extinction of the KST, an endangered species found only in the Kihansi Gorge, the
government was completely unprepared to address the situation. There was no framework in place
for environmental management, water resources management, or a process for allocation of water for
conservation. A program of mitigation measures was the government’s only option.

62. Preventing the potential extinction of an endangered species is an exceedingly complex task; it is
costly because of the scientific uncertainty regarding the processes involved. Considerable time is
needed to respond to unexpected events such as diseases, mortality, and predators, which can wipe
out whole populations even in captivity. Experimentation, disease diagnosis and control, close
monitoring, and adaptive management proved to be an effective and successful strategy in the
LKEMP in preventing the extinction of the KST, restoring the wetland habitat, and reintroducing the
species back into the wild.

63. When environmental impacts involving scientific uncertainty need to be addressed, it is prudent
to involve partners from the scientific community early in the project cycle. These partnerships can
yield multiple benefits, ranging from the provision of scientific knowledge and expertise, the transfer
of skills to the client country, and a reduced risk that the project will fail to meet its goals. Very little
was known about the KST’s habitat or the reasons for its mortality. A globally recognized
conservation biologist was engaged to advise the team. Partnerships mobilized with the IUCN and


                                                     17
the Bronx and Toledo Zoos in the United States provided much-needed support during critical
periods in the project’s implementation.

64. Internalization of environmental management plans within the developer’s operating principles
and framework is good practice. The internalization of the EMP including the maintenance of
conservation infrastructure within TANESCO operational program and the support for re-
introduction of KST are very good outcomes of the LKEMP, of its design and for sustainability.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower, Implementing Agencies, Partners
7.1 Borrower and implementing agencies
The Borrower’s Completion Report (summarized in Annex 7) provides as assessment similar to the
findings of the Bank’s ICR. Technical representatives from the main implementing agency, NEMC
and key participating agencies endorsed the ratings and observations of the Bank ICR at the
stakeholder’s workshop on November 11, 2011.

The former Director General of NEMC noted that balancing development and conservation is a
major challenge, especially in developing countries. He noted that Tanzania has successfully
achieved the trade-offs required for balancing energy requirements with conservation of the Kihansi
Spray Toad. At the end of the project, the KST that had disappeared completely from the site had
survived in captivity and are being reintroduced. The hydropower generation continues and the
survival of the Kihansi Spray Toad is ensured.

Other observations include that a follow-on project should focus on the wider landscape, linking the
Kihansi to the conservation of the broader Udzungwa mountains.

7.2 Co financiers
Not applicable

7.3 Other partners and stakeholders
(e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)

65. A cross-section of stakeholders interviewed in Tanzania and the United States and a stakeholder
workshop in Dar es Salaam (November 11, 2011) confirmed the findings reported in aide memoires
and other reports that implementation of the project was satisfactory. Highlights noted by
stakeholders included: (i) restoration of Kihansi Spray Wetlands; (ii) determination of the Final
Water Right; (iii) maintenance of environmental flows from bypass releases; (iv) a stable and
growing captive population of KSTs; and (v) the reintroduction plan devised for the KST. IUCN’s
amphibian expert expressed optimism that the reintroduction of the KST would have a reasonable
degree of success, given the knowledge gained from experiments and advanced knowledge to
address issues related to the chytrid fungus. Details are provided in Annex 8.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
1. This annex presents an assessment of achievements under each component of the LKEMP. It is
intended to provide more insight into the project’s achievements and the rationale for the PDO rating.

(a) Component 1: Habitat and species conservation and management

The achievement of this component is measured against two indicators. They are: (a) KST population
maintained and (b) maintenance of the Gorge wetland continues.

2. For (a) KST population maintained, the project has been successful in preventing the extinction
of the KST. This achievement is particularly significant given the scientific uncertainty regarding the
causes of habitat and species degradation, unexpected mortality, and limited knowledge about the
KST when the project began. Captive breeding was initiated as a safety net against extinction of the
species and to gain a better understanding of its biology. An Environmental Center at Kihansi and
two captive breeding facilities have been constructed at UDSM and Kihansi. At project start up, the
KST had declined to 12000 in the spray wetlands. Subsequently the entire population in the gorge
crashed. The captive population in the United States also declined to fewer than 100 before slowly
rebounding. At the end of 2011, ex situ populations of KST are stable, with about 6000 in the United
States and about 400 in Tanzania. One thousand additional KSTs are expected to be transferred to
Tanzania in January 2012 for the reintroduction. The risk to sustainability is minimized due to
advances in knowledge about the KST, the large captive KST population, improved knowledge and
capacity to diagnose and control disease, and successful experiments with chytrid fungus.

3. TANESCO has mobilized US$ 578,000 from different sources to implement the EMP, which
includes funding to reintroduce and monitor the KST. The KST experience is reported as
international best practice in science related to amphibians, setting a precedent as the first
reintroduction of an extinct amphibian species in the wild through a population bred in captivity. As
noted, amphibian experts believe that it could take less than two years for a viable KST population to
reestablish in the gorge; other scientists believe that it could take about ten years for an endangered
species to stabilize. Continuity of resources for monitoring will be an important issue that the
government will need to face.

4. For (b) maintenance of the gorge wetland continues, over time, the bypass flow, combined
with the sprinkler system, allowed the spray wetlands to regenerate. Of a total area of 11.747
m2 of spray wetlands, 10,619 m2 in the Upper and Lower Spray Wetlands amounting to 90.3%
                                             6
to the total spray wetlands has been restored .

5. In the Upper, Middle, and Lower Spray Wetlands, the presence of Arthroleptides yakusini
tadpoles, one of the important native species, was recorded. Close monitoring by a number of
agencies, including NEMC, RBWO, and UDSM, created the conditions to support regeneration, with

dramatic improvements reported in plant communities in the Upper, Middle, and Lower Spray
Wetlands. The necessary infrastructure was installed and is in use, including: (i) pathways and
bridges to support the conservation of habitat and species; (ii) sprinkler systems and fountain jets to
create the spray mist; and (iii) 11 permanent monitoring stations to record air temperature, relative
humidity, soil moisture, amphibian abundance, endemic species of vegetation, and rainfall. These
initiatives have resulted the recurrence of native vegetation and amphibian species and the decline of
invasive species. The decline in height of the invasive species by 60 percent since 2009 is reported in
the Middle Spray Wetland. Key aspects of the Ecological Monitoring Program (known as the Gibbs
Protocols) and data on the decline of invasive species and increase in noninvasive species are
available in Annex 8.

(b) Component 2: Enforcement of the Final Water Right

6.     The achievement of this goal is measured through four intermediate indicators: (a)
framework for monitoring and enforcement of compliance with the Final Water Right implemented;
(b) TANESCO to regularly collect data for hydrological model calibration; (c) compliance by
TANESCO; and (d) RBWO continues to enforce Final Water Right through support from the Ministry
of Water.

7. For (a) framework for monitoring and enforcement compliance with the Final Water Right
implemented. Legal and institutional reforms supported by the project required a Water Right for
users. The Final Water Right for TANESCO included a condition for a bypass flow from the dam of
1.5–2.0 cubic meters per second. Significant achievements include: (i) Final Water Right determined
and enforced; (ii) contribution to the Water Policy; (iii) raw data entered into the ecological data base
following the Monitoring Protocol; (iv) water use permit conditions enforced; (vi) indicators for
water and land use developed; and (v) sediment load report prepared. Risks associated with the
sustainability of these achievements include TANESCO’s noncompliance with the Water Right and
RWBO’s inability to monitor effective compliance, but they are minimized by the government’s
commitment to maintaining the bypass flow (a legal obligation) and RBWO’s commitment to
monitoring the use of their operational budget.

8. For (b) TANESCO to regularly collect data for hydrological model calibration, TANESCO
continues to collect hydro-meteorological data to calibrate the model and maintain the ecosystem. A
hydrological monitoring program for compliance with the Water Right Condition was prepared and
completed by December 2003.

9. For (c) compliance by TANESCO, except for two instances during implementation, TANESCO
remained in full compliance with obligations under the Final Water Right. TANESCO informed the
ICR mission that the two failures were caused by a technical error. TANESCO has mainstreamed the
EMP into its normal operations and has mobilized resources for its implementation. TANESCO also
maintains the sprinkler systems and collects hydro-meteorological data.

10. For (d) RBWO continues to enforce Final Water Right through support from the Ministry of
Water, RBWO obtains hydrological data from TANESCO and the monitoring stations in the gorge.
Regular site visits and station inspections have been done. The data indicate compliance with the
Final Water Right. RBWO carries out the monitoring with its normal operational budget and is
awaiting the release of targeted funds for LKEMP activities from the ministry.



                                                   21
11. Despite two failures, TANESCO continues to comply with the Water Right and the
achievements in policy and legal reform are exemplary.

(c) Component 3: Implementing an Updated EMP

12. This objective is measured against one intermediate indicator: The updated EMP was developed
and implemented by TANESCO using its own resources. The preparation of an updated EMP was a
legal covenant of the project, alongside a Final Water Right to operate the LKHP. The EMP was
developed and in use by TANESCO by 2004. It legally binds TANESCO to implement mitigation
measures for the Kihansi Gorge from the operation of LKHP. According to the EMP, most
operational costs associated with mitigation, monitoring and environmental auditing will be
supported financially by LKHP and/or its owner, TANESCO, after the closure of IDA Credit 3546 -
1-TA for LKEMP. The updated EMP for LKHP provides a valuable guide and budget for activities
to be carried out by actors/sectors and the regulatory responsibilities and procedures in force until the
decommissioning of the LKHP/dam.

13. The updated EMP estimates annual recurrent costs for mitigation and monitoring programs,
primarily in the Kihansi Gorge and Kihansi River, to be US$ 562,700, of which US$ 382,700 is to be
covered by TANESCO until the decommissioning of the dam. The EMP also stipulates the LKHP
Final Water Right Agreement and related aspects of LKHP environmental flow, including a
continued advisory role for NEMC to RBWO on aspects of the Water Right related to environmental
(or bypass) flows. At the closing of the project, TANESCO had internalized the EMP within its work
program and supported implementation with its own resources. Implementation is carried out by a
number of different agencies; as noted, TANESCO mobilized funding and contracted with UDSM to
carry out the KST reintroduction. Issues noted are: (i) the absence of an Environmental Management
System at TANESCO and (ii) lack of compliance with some recommendations of the Environmental
Audit.




                                                   22
(d) Component 4: Institutional Strengthening

14. Overall achievement of the component is rated moderately satisfactory based on three
intermediate indicators: (a) capacity of the national institutions to manage environmental and water
resources built; (b) support to UDSM, training of government staff continue, equipment provided;
and (c) course curricula in Conservation Biology and Water Resources Management at UDSM
implemented.

15. For indicator (a) capacity of the national institutions to manage environmental and water
resources built, by project closure, 75 percent of the core staff of environmental units in sectoral
agencies had the skills required for environmental oversight. Personnel in environmental units in
their respective ministries benefitted from a range of training, including on-the-job, informal, formal,
and customized training. Core staff of RBWO also received training and equipment and internalized
the concept of environmental flows within the Water Policy. The accomplishments are considerable
given the low awareness of environmental flows and Environmental Impact Assessments at start-up.

16. For (b) support to UDSM, training of government staff continue, equipment provided, LKEMP
supported: short-term and long-term (MSc and PhD) overseas training in Conservation Biology and
water resources management, provided in-house training in environmental compliance and
enforcement, and initiated BSc and MSc courses in integrated water resources management and
water resource engineering at UDSM. It also provided laboratory and teaching equipment, computers
and accessories, and reference books and other library materials for UDSM. Additional equipment
and training were provided to maintain captive breeding stations.

17. For (c), course curricula in Conservation Biology and Water Resources Management at UDSM
implemented, and capacity was developed in SUA in disease diagnosis and control in amphibians,
chytrid monitoring and control. A curriculum in Conservation Biology was developed at UDSM and
is increasingly used. As noted, teaching materials, textbooks, chemicals, and computers were
provided as well. The proposed curriculum review and development of a new curriculum for long-
term training under the faculties of Water Resources Management and law at UDSM were not done.

18. While the project built significant capacity in a range of subject areas, this component is rated
moderately satisfactory, given the lack of evidence related to the first indicator—the ability to
manage environmental resources.

Communication and outreach

19. A Communication Strategy was developed and implemented in 2004 to improve information
flow to stakeholders. Outputs included a newsletter in Kiswahili, newspaper articles, leaflets, t-shirts,
caps, and postage stamps depicting the KST. Public awareness was additionally raised by a number
of national and external agencies including LKEMP, NEMC, Hifadhi Mazingira/Environmental
Conservation (HIMA), CONCERN, the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund, and World Wide Fund
for Nature. Stakeholders reported very high public environmental awareness in the Kihansi
catchment area. Dissemination of scientific and technical material, exchange of expert discussions,
media programs, and competitions for schools all helped raise awareness. A mini-communication
strategy was developed for the KST reintroduction plan and implemented from June 2009 to
December 2010. A Crisis Management and Communication Plan was also used when the first batch
of KSTs arrived from the United States in August 2010.
                                                   23
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. LKEMP was designed as a Technical Assistance project that would build institutional, legal, and
regulatory capacity to mitigate environmental impacts resulting from a previous World Bank
investment. As such, it was not considered necessary to carry out an economic and financial analysis
or determine the economic rate of return. At the project’s close, it is not possible to calculate rates of
return because most outputs are too complex to be quantified, and many outcomes will be realized
only over the long term. Additionally, this project is a remedial program and standard cost benefit
analysis would not apply in this situation. In most Technical Assistance projects Efficiency is not
rated.

2. This project has achieved efficiency with a few shortcomings which were due to unanticipated
developments. The project yielded both site specific, national and global benefits, stemming mainly
from putting in place a comprehensive environmental and water resources management framework.
These regulatory regimes will help GoT avoid future costs of degradation in sensitive ecosystems.
Additionally the project prevented the extinction of an endangered species and supported the
restoration of critical habitat.

3. The original project allocated 74.3 percent of costs to consultancy services and training; of the
remainder, 3.5 percent was allocated for civil works, 7.4 percent for goods and equipment, and 5.5
percent for incremental operating costs. The consultancy services and training were the focus of the
project, leading to: improved ecological management, policy and legal reform, determination of the
Final Water Right, creation of artificial spray systems, translocation of KSTs for captive breeding,
and the development and implementation of a reintroduction plan. Were the resources efficiently
used? It is a challenge to answer this question, given that the project was the first of its kind to
translocate an extinct in the wild species that was bred in captivity, create artificial wetlands, and
undertake a multitude of experiments to prepare for its reintroduction into the wild. The ICR team
was informed by an esteemed scientist that even international conservation NGOs have yet to embark
on tasks similar to those in LKEMP.

4. Of the Additional Financing, 49 percent was allocated for consultancy services, training, and audit
fees; 1.8 percent for civil works; 4.1 percent for goods and equipment; 11.1 percent for grants to
communities and district councils; and 27.8 percent for incremental operating costs. Consultancy and
training continue to receive the largest share of resources, but the share allocated to incremental
operating costs rises in recognition of the remoteness of the location and the large number of
agencies that have a role in monitoring and in implementing the project. Was this an efficient use of
resources? Again it is difficult to determine with certainty. Experience shows that more resources are
needed where capacity is weak and awareness low. Under Component 1, ecosystem monitoring and
conservation, species conservation, and captive breeding are all complex tasks requiring consulting
expertise and institutional collaboration within the country and with external partners. Similarly,
under Components 2 and 3, hydrological modeling, the Environmental Audit, and support to RBWO
are all complex, time-consuming activities requiring consultancy services and incremental operating
costs. Component 3 supported capacity building and training for a range of institutions (NEMC,
RBWO, SUA, UDSM, Wildlife Division, TAWRI, the Vice President’s Office, district officials, and
community leaders). None of these benefits can be quantified. Many have short-, medium-, and long-
term benefits. With regard to community grants, an economic analysis is premature, because most
have been under implementation for only two years.

5. LKEMP incurred a total cost of US$ 9.5 million over a ten year period. Additional Financing of
US$ 3.5 million and additional three years of project time were not anticipated, but was required to
address the unanticipated mortality of the KST in the gorge and to support captive breeding. The
reintroduction of KSTs required more time and research to develop a stable population, conduct
experiments, and ensure suitable habitat for reentry. The updated EMP for LKHP has estimated
annual incremental costs of US$ 562,700 for mitigation and monitoring programs. Given these
estimates, US$ 1 million per year to implement an environmental management program, achieving
important policy, legal, institutional, and regulatory reforms, prevent the extinction of an endangered
species and restore a valuable ecosystem demonstrates efficient use of resources. The PDO took
longer than expected to achieve. As clarified earlier, this was due to unanticipated crash in population
of KST in the Gorge and the mortality in captivity due to the spread of disease. The cost of
consultants was high due to the lack of scientific expertise in-country, in habitat restoration and
conservation of endangered species. Incremental costs were also high due to the remoteness of the
location and the large number of institutions involved in monitoring the Kihansi ecosystem and its
species. Some of these costs may have been categorized training, given that ecological monitoring
was largely building capacity.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
1. A stakeholder workshop was held on November 11, 2011 to discuss the preliminary findings of
the ICR (results are summarized in table 6.1). Technical representatives from almost all participating
agencies attended the workshop. They reviewed the accomplishment of the PDO relative to the
indicators, as outlined in the Results Framework. A discussion was held on the actual values achieve
at completion of the project. Stakeholders also discussed the intermediate outcome indicators and the
actual values achieved. There was a high degree of interest in the ratings and significant
contributions were provided in justification of changes to particular ratings. A discussion was also
held on important themes in the ICR, including relevance, achievement of the PDO, efficiency,
sustainability, government and other stakeholder commitment, and government performance and
Bank performance. In addition to the discussions on performance, some recommendations were
made, including: (i) simplification of the Ecological Monitoring Data Base; (ii) review of reporting
and data entry formats; (iii) clarification of responsibility for data analysis prior to handing over the
data base to TAWIRI; and (iv) clarification by stakeholders on all commitments towards LKEMP
and channeling those resources to the coordinating entity. The ICR team was informed that the
Ministerial Steering Committee decided that TAWIRI would assume management of the Kihansi
Research Station and Ecological Data Base, and that the Research and Monitoring Project Officer
would be transferred from NEMC to the Wildlife Division. The meeting was chaired by a senior staff
member representing the Director General, NEMC—the current coordinating entity for LKEMP.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
Project background

2. This ICR for LKEMP has been prepared with the objective of making an assessment on the
project performance during the ten-year period from July 2001 to June 2011. The report takes a
critical look at the various stages of the project cycle—from design to implementation—the
challenges faced, and lessons that could be drawn from this project.

3. In 1993, the Government of Tanzania approved the construction of the 180-megawatt Lower
Kihansi Hydropower Plant (LKHP), with financing from the World Bank, European Investment
Bank, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, Swedish International Development
Cooperation Agency, and KfW (the German development bank). The facility, which was designed to
be a run-of-the river peaking plant, is operated by TANESCO with the provision for expansion to
300 megawatts. The plant makes use of the reservoir that retains water from the Kihansi River.
Beyond the dam, the river plunges through the moist spray forest at the gorge to the Kilombero
floodplains.

4. Prior to its construction, several Environmental Assessments were carried out. The first
Environmental Assessment was carried out by Ekono Energy, which focused on upstream impacts,
detailed only upstream mitigation measures, and did not address downstream issues, water right, or
dam safety. Other studies followed, including the ecological assessment report by NORAD in 1995.
In 1996 it was concluded that diversion of water from the river would have downstream
environmental impacts, and a Long-term Ecological Monitoring Program for Kihansi Gorge was put
in place while a longer-term solution for conservation of the whole catchment was being sought.
Concurrently, mitigation measures based on environmental and social health studies through
SEMAKI (Socio Economic Mitigation at Kihansi) and MUAJAKI (a public health program) were
initiated.

5. The dam was commissioned in 1999, which resulted in the reduction of the river flow by more
than 90 percent (from 16 to 1.5 cubic meters per second) and brought about significant
environmental impacts, particularly on the biodiversity that depended on the fine spray from the
Kihansi falls. This effect was compounded by the discovery of a critically endangered spray toad—
Nectophrynoides asperginis, the Kihansi spray toad (KST)—and other endemic species whose
survival depended on the microclimate created by the falls. Friends of the Earth, an international
environmental organization based in the United States, raised concern about the impact of the LKHP
on the critically endangered KST and the obligations of the funding agencies and the Government of
Tanzania to the Convention on Biological Diversity.

6. To fulfill its obligation to the Convention on Biological Diversity and Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species, the Government of Tanzania proposed a minimum
bypass flow of 7.0–7.7 cubic meters per second, which was highly contested by TANESCO, citing
the reason that the hydropower plant would not be economically feasible. In 2001, NORAD funded
the Immediate Rescue and Emergency Measures Project, which focused on the ecological studies of
the KST, construction of walkways and bridges, installation of the artificial sprinkler system to
maintain the spray wetland, and captive breeding of KSTs or their translocation upstream. Ultimately
499 KSTs were translocated to United States zoos under the care of the Wildlife Conservation



                                                31
Society. Consequently flow manipulation studies were carried out to determine the Final Water Right
to be issued to TANESCO.

7. The LKEMP was formulated in 2001 with the objective of putting in place a series of medium-
term measures to ensure long-term conservation of Kihansi Gorge and its upstream catchment areas.
It also aimed to support the development of a coordinated and consistent legal and institutional
framework for environmental and water resources management. The project was implemented
through four key components, namely: Habitat and Species Conservation and Management,
Established/Enforcement of Water Right, Implementation of Updated EMP, and Institutional
Strengthening. Details of individual components are highlighted in the main text.

8. The project received from the World Bank/IDA a total credit of XDR 7.3 million over the ten-
year period for implementation of mitigation measures arising from the construction of LKHP.
Activities were implemented by seven key sectors, namely the Vice President’s Office, Ministry of
Natural Resources and Tourism, Ministry of Water, Ministry of Energy and Minerals, UDSM, SUA,
and the three riparian Districts of Kilolo, Mufindi, and Kilombero.

Assessment of project performance

9. On the project design, the project was a classic case of adaptive assessment and management.
There was no Logical Framework Analysis prepared, which was somehow not applicable in this
unique case as new technical methods based on on-site experimental field work had to be developed
to address issues that needed policy decisions for the sustainability of the hydropower project.
However, a Results Framework was prepared during the Additional Financing phase, with outcome
and output indicators in place.

10. The project’s development objective (PDO) and specific objectives were in line with the
Government of Tanzania’s policies that addressed environmental management, obligations to
international conventions, and poverty reduction. The PDO was also in line with the World Bank
Strategy for Tanzania.

11. Implementation of project activities was monitored through reports, field visits, and Multisectoral
Technical Advisory Committee and Steering Committee meetings. However, the monitoring and
evaluation mechanism lacked a comprehensive framework with measurable indicators that could help
to chart the way forward during the implementation period.

12. An overall assessment showed that the project has satisfactorily achieved its conservation
objective and helped, to a great extent, to put in place a legal framework for the management of the
environment and water resources by facilitating lengthy stakeholder participation that led to the
enactment of the Environmental Management Act (EMA Cap 191) and its Regulations. Issues arising
from this project also influenced the inclusion of environmental flow as legitimate use of water and
second in priority after human consumption.

13. The key challenge to maximum achievement of the PDO was that the scope of the project was
not broad enough to realize outcomes arising from long-term conservation measures or those that
required participation of a wider landscape within the catchment. There were also unforeseen events,
such as the disappearance of the KST in the wild, which led to a refocusing of the project component
on reintroduction to its original habitat.

Outputs by project component

14. Individual activities within each component were rated separately, as outlined in Performance
ratings ranged from moderately satisfactory to highly satisfactory, the latter having been completed
to satisfaction and within the given timeframe.

15. Component 1: LKEMP has satisfactorily managed to put in place mechanisms for conservation
and management of the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem by taking the following steps:
     Instituted a comprehensive ecological monitoring program with specified indicators that
      would determine its recovery trend.
     Ensured the functioning of sprinkler systems to complement the environmental flow that
      allowed for recovery of the spray wetland within the gorge.
     Sustained the captive-bred population in United States zoos and in the country.
     Instituted measures for landscape-wide conservation of Kihansi Gorge and its catchment.
      These included the establishment of subprojects that would improve the livelihoods of
      riparian communities within the catchment area and hence reduce dependence on cultivation
      close to water sources.

16. Component 2: The Final Water Right was successfully determined to be 1.5–2.0 cubic meters
per second.

17. RBWO monitored the compliance by receiving the transmitted hydrological data from the dam
and making regular site visits. TANESCO complied with the Final Water Right conditions by
extending the bypass flow pipe, which was not releasing the required flow, and rectified the
inconsistency arising from inputting the wrong formula.

18. Hydrological studies were carried out to determine if catchment activities would have impacts on
the availability of water in Kihansi River. Results of the study indicated impending changes in the
hydrology of Kihansi catchment that might require policy decisions for the sustainability of the
hydropower plant.

19. Component 3: The EMP was successfully updated and implemented by stakeholders.
     Ecological monitoring program was in place, Final Water Right enforced, and a program to
      reintroduce the KST initiated.
     TANESCO commissioned a study to determine whether the dam would be impacted by
      seismic activities within the catchment. Results showed that there was no imminent danger of
      an earthquake that might cause destruction to the dam.
     Two Environmental Audit Reports were prepared to assess the status of EMP implementation
      as per the requirement in the Environmental Impact Assessment and Audit Regulations.

20. Component 4: Capacity on environmental and water resources management enhanced at
individual and institutional level.

21. NEMC had effectively coordinated the implementation of activities by different sectors. The
project followed Bank and Government of Tanzania procedures on procurement and financial
management and ensured timely delivery of reports as per the requirement. Furthermore, LKEMP
has played a significant role in building the human resource capacity on environmental and water


                                                33
resources management in terms of raising awareness on the importance of making critical policy
decisions based on scientific findings. Capacity has been built satisfactorily in the following areas:
     Strengthening the regulatory aspect of environmental and water resources management
        through policy revision, enactment of the Environmental Management Act and its seven
        Regulations, and preparation of Guidelines for Compliance and Enforcement for NEMC.
     Strengthening the human resource capacity through short- and long-term training (MSc and
        PhD) of key implementing staff and participation in specialized courses, workshops, and
        conferences.
     Building local capacity in conservation issues by recruiting two experts to assist in the
        preparation of curricula for Conservation Biology and Water Resources Management.
     Establishment of an MSc Conservation Biology Course at UDSM.
     Provision of teaching material, reference books, and scientific equipment to UDSM and SUA.

22. A Communication Strategy was prepared to address negative media publicity on the project and
raise awareness of the importance of catchment conservation for sustainable utilization of resources.
The Communication Strategy was specifically important when the project was preparing to receive
the first batch of KSTs from the United States. Since the event received international media attention,
a Crisis Management and Communication Plan was prepared in advance to address any unforeseen
emergency during or after the arrival of the KSTs.

Factors that affected project implementation and achievement of outputs and outcomes

23. Several factors affected the achievement of output and outcomes to the maximum satisfaction,
including: uncertainty as to whether reintroduction of the KST would become a success or not;
continued dependence on limited resources within the catchment due to lack of economic diversity;
uncoordinated planning, leading to conflicting land uses within the catchment and thus affecting the
sustainability of the hydropower project; and delays in receiving counterpart funds, impacting on the
timely implementation of activities that required a counterpart fund contribution.

24. Sustainability of activities depends to a large extent on TANESCO’s commitment to the
implementation of the EMP. However TANESCO has little capacity to implement some activities,
especially those linked to the survival of the gorge and catchment conservation. No clear mechanism
is in place for continued implementation of these important activities. However, the project can be
termed sustainable in the following areas:
      Implementation of individual activities within the EMP, such as the existence of monitoring
        protocols and compliance with the Water Right.
      Capacity to address issues related to conservation of fragile ecosystems, such as management
        of captive breeding facilities, disease diagnosis, and maintenance of key infrastructure that
        sustains the spray wetland.
      Organizational capacity in terms of what needs to be done in case a similar case emerges.

Assessment of mainstreaming arrangements

25. The overall performance on mainstreaming has been moderately satisfactory. Mainstreaming
focused on three key areas: implementation of the EMP, mitigation of catchment stresses, and
enforcement of the Water Right. Activities were mainstreamed to pertinent sectors as shown in
whereas NEMC retained the coordination role, provided that TANESCO provide funds for
implementing activities. Other sectors have already incorporated some activities in their work plans.

                                                  34
26. Capacity was built at various levels to ensure sustainability of activities if mainstreamed in
sectors. Sectors have been integrating these activities at a slow pace, however, and they are in most
cases accorded low priority and suffered budget cuts.

Bank/Borrower performance

27. The Bank worked very well with the Government of Tanzania and other stakeholders at all stages
of preparation and implementation of the project. Regular supervision missions were made as
planned, and aide memoires were prepared in a timely way and circulated to all key parties. The
implementing agencies found them very useful, as they were detailed and pointed out critical
outstanding issues, solutions, and action strategies for effective implementation of project activities.

28. The Government of Tanzania, as the Borrower, was also committed to the achievement of project
objectives through active participation of stakeholders at different decision-making levels. All
approvals related to the project were obtained without major delays, financial and procurement
procedures were followed, and pertinent financial and audit reports prepared in good time.

29. The implementing agencies executed their work and submitted annual work plans, budgets, and
progress reports to the Coordination Unit at NEMC. Management of day-to-day activities was
mainstreamed into NEMC, and all expenditures had to be approved by the Director General through
the respective Directorate of Environmental Planning and Research.

30. The performance of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory.

Procurement of project services

31. During Phase I of the project, procurement of civil works, goods, and consultancies could not be
implemented as planned due to lack of counterpart funds, which were 10 percent of the cost of
procured services. Procurement capacity at NEMC was enhanced by the establishment of the
Procurement Management Unit at NEMC and the training of two officers and Tender Board
members on procurement procedures for World Bank-funded projects.

32. All services (civil, goods, and consultancies) were procured satisfactorily during the project’s life.

Lessons learned during project implementation

33. Lessons on project design at all stages of implementation:
     The uniqueness and complex nature of the project provided the need to align environmental
       protection measures based on scientific studies that were carried out while the project was on
       the ground. This strategy allowed issues of significance to be adapted during the
       implementation of the project.
     Key policy decisions beyond the project’s scope were adapted during the project
       implementation stage. These included maintenance of sufficient flows through the Kihansi
       Gorge to conserve the ecosystem and the translocation of KSTs to the United States and its
       reintroduction to the wild. This decision was made in respect of the commitment to the
       international conventions that the Government of Tanzania ratified.



                                                   35
      Project implementation arrangements both at the national and district levels eventually tested
       the concepts of multisectoral and multidisciplinary approaches in problem-solving
       interventions in the country.
      Involvement of communities in catchment conservation.

34. Key technical lessons and experiences gathered during the implementation of specific project
components:
     This specific case highlights the decision-making challenges of balancing development with
       conservation objectives and the need to make proper decisions based on the scientific
       findings.
     The Lower Kihansi project provided the Government of Tanzania with the opportunity to
       have environmental legislation in place and the necessity to carry out Environmental Impact
       Assessments in all new development projects.
     The Government of Tanzania has driven conservation issues to the forefront and confirmed
       its commitment to conservation of biodiversity.
     The issue of environmental flow was accorded due priority.
     Building local capacity was an important aspect to make the project sustainable.

Attainment of global environmental objectives and outcomes

35. As a signatory to the key conventions that relate to the environment, Tanzania has contributed
significantly towards the conservation of highly endangered and endemic species such as the KST
and wild coffee. The decision to translocate KSTs to the United States was a significant step that
saved the species and showed the government’s commitment toward the attainment of global
environmental objectives.

36. This complex case study has contributed to improved awareness about environmental flows and
the need to systematically address downstream impacts of water resources development.

37. Ongoing studies related to reintroduction and biological control of amphibians against the chytrid
fungus will contribute significantly towards the global knowledge on amphibian biology.

Ownership, commitment to sustain good practices, and potential for replication of approaches
adopted by the project

38. The whole purpose of mainstreaming activities into the sector’s plans and budgets was to put in
place mechanisms for ensuring that good practices will be sustained through their continued
application. This project invested in capacity building at the local and institutional levels to enable
local experts to address issues of similar nature in the future.

39. The potential for replication of some of the approaches adopted by the project is enormous for a
number of reasons. For example, multisectoral and interdisciplinary approaches used during the
implementation of project activities have speeded ownership of activities after the completion of the
project. Community involvement was seen as vital if any conservation measures were to be taken
seriously.

Cost-benefit analysis in terms of biodiversity conservation interventions that have been funded
by the project

                                                  36
40. It is extremely difficult to put any value to a species that is endemic and with a very limited
ecological habitat such as the KST, wild coffee, and other undiscovered species. However, the
survival of such species is a good indication that the ecosystem is healthy, with balanced ecological
functions. In this context, TANESCO’s contribution toward the conservation of biodiversity and the
catchment as a whole is cost-effective and ensures sustainability of the hydropower plant for the next
fifty years.

Captive breeding program for KSTs

1. According to the Curator of the Toledo Zoo, the population in the Toledo and Bronx zoos were
less than 100 in 2003. An intensive biosecurity program conducted by the zoos was successful in
enhancing population growth and in establishing a disease-free population for reintroduction. By
2009, the captive population in the Toledo Zoo had grown so large that population control measures
had to be implemented. Some of the KST were translocated to other zoos in the United States,
including to Syracuse for toxicity experiments. Currently the Toledo Zoo is geared up to support the
reintroduction program, with a total population of about 3,500 (Table 8.1).

KST reintroduction

2. On the success of reintroduction, IUCN’s international expert on amphibians, Don Church has
noted:

          Having a large captive population of KST provides an opportunity to reintroduce
          animals into their native habitat repeatedly over several months, possibly years,
          thereby increasing the chance of success. It is likely that the amphibian chytrid
          fungus persists within the gorge and thus poses a continued threat. However, there are
          several reasons to remain hopeful that reintroduction will be successful. First, there
          are documented accounts of amphibian species going through population bottlenecks
          due to chytridiomycosis outbreaks, but then being able to persist with the pathogen in
          the environment. In the case of the KST, we now have the opportunity to continue to
          put animals into the environment until resistant individuals are able to re-establish a
          wild population. We cannot predict when resistance will evolve (assuming it hasn't
          already), but the placement of more animals into the environment increases the
          probability that any resistant individuals that may exist will be returned to the wild
          and successfully contribute to a new wild population. Working in our favor is also the
          relatively short generation time of the toads that increases the number of mutations
          per unit time and thereby effectively shortens the time to evolution of resistance.
                                                                                 D. Church, 2011

Ecological monitoring
3. The indicators were developed through a participatory process and confirmed through an
International Expert Panel process.7 Following the Monitoring Protocol, the data collected at Kihansi
are entered and backed up on computers and exported in simplified format to main offices in Dar es
Salaam, where the data are imported, archived, analyzed, presented in reports, and disseminated.
Indicators were developed along six tiers according to priority. The first three indicators provided a
baseline, which was tracked against four criteria (Table 8.2).

4. The status of each indicator relative to each criterion was provided in terms of a qualitative
assessments of “high,? “intermediate,? or “low?. The baseline values, against which trends in
changes in the ecosystem would be tracked, were taken from the Norplan report.8 Table 8.3 shows
the first and second tier indicators used for monitoring of the Kihansi Gorge.

Habitat restoration

5. Experts on the ICR mission (including Bill Newmark) noted that the habitat structure of the
Upper, Lower, and Middle Spray Wetlands significantly improved as a result of the joint operation of
the primary and backup sprinkler systems. They noted that in the Upper and Lower Spray Wetlands
the vegetation structure is now highly similar to that prior to the commissioning of the dam. This
recovery is important because these two spray wetlands historically contained over 95% of the KST
population. Changes in the decline of invasive species and increase of noninvasive plant species are
outlined in Table 8.4. It has been observed that amphibian species that used to inhabit the wetland
have also returned.
