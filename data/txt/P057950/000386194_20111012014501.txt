1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country background. The Dayton Peace Agreement, which ended the war in 1995, gave Bosnia
and Herzegovina (BiH) important distinctive features. BiH was constituted as a country with a
State Government holding relatively limited powers, and two largely autonomous sub-national
Entities (and subsequently the small autonomous Brcko District). The larger of the two Entities,
with two thirds of the BiH population, is called the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the
Federation or FBiH). The smaller is called Republika Srpska (RS). The FBiH is subdivided into
10 cantons, each with its own executive, legislative, and judicial branches of Government. Each
canton is subdivided into municipalities. The RS is more centralized and is subdivided only into
municipalities.

Since early 2001 leading up to the time of Appraisal of the Solid Waste Management Project
(SWMP), State and Entity governments were working more effectively together than during any
time since Dayton. Economic reform did accelerate in some areas, but it was not as
comprehensive as expected. In the face of strong ethnic and vested interest resistance, difficult
policy decisions were either delayed or proved difficult to implement. Goals of developing a
predictable and coherent investment environment countrywide and a self-sustaining economy
were, therefore, still a long way from being accomplished and growth continued to slow down.
Some objectives were, nevertheless, achieved, including important steps in State building and
strengthening institutions and governance. This resulted in significant progress being made in the
stabilization and association process with the EU.

Sector background. In 2000, solid waste collection services in Bosnia and Herzegovina covered
only about 60 percent of the larger municipalities and a much lower share in rural towns.
Institutional and enforcement capacity was weak, and equipment for waste collection and
disposal was obsolete and poorly maintained. As a result, significant amounts of waste were
discarded in unofficial sites such as wild dumps, roadsides, rivers and mines, posing a direct risk
to public health and causing serious environmental problems.

Main challenges. Before the war, collection of waste was organized purely at the local level.
There was only partial separation of waste collection and recycling. Waste from urban locations
was transported to local landfills and dumped, although with limited controls. However, the
equipment for waste collection and disposal was mostly obsolete and/or poorly maintained. As a
result, waste collection and disposal capacities were unable to keep up with waste production.
This led to significant quantities of waste being discarded in unofficial sites posing a direct risk
to public health. Waste collected by municipalities was often disposed in “official? dumpsites
that were generally open dumps rather than controlled landfills. Runoff and leachate infiltration
from dumpsites were potential hazards for the groundwater aquifers in some areas of BiH that
provided the main source of water supply. The most serious problems caused by such dumpsites
include the deterioration in groundwater quality, the destruction of vegetative cover, and the
proliferation of insects and rodents that bore diseases. These serious public health and
environmental problems were worsened by weak institutional and enforcement capacity.



                                                 1
Furthermore, odors and unsightliness discouraged development in the immediate vicinity of
these dumps and ended up being harmful to overall economic development.

Rationale for Bank involvement. There was a strong rationale for World Bank involvement. The
Bank's primary advantage was that it had the stature and reputation in BiH of being capable of
preparing and implementing difficult projects that had major associated policy/strategy issues
associated with them. The Bank was seen as an honest broker for facilitating the sharing of
multi-municipal landfill sites, involving full participation of both Cantons and Municipal
officials and continuous dialogue with the various municipalities. Also, Bank involvement raised
the stakes for any possible backtracking on commitments. Through Bank involvement, a sound
financial management system was to be set up. Accounts were to be audited annually in
accordance with international auditing standards. Furthermore, procurement of goods and
services in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines could minimize the cost of
equipment purchase and installation.

Project background. In 2002, the Solid Waste Management Project, supported by IDA funding
of US$26 million, was launched. This was the first Bank-financed Project implemented by only
one Project Management Unit (PMU) for both the Federation (FBiH) and Republika Srspka
(RS). Given the significant environmental improvement in participating areas, the Project was
expanded through additional resources, and a new Project was approved to support rehabilitation
of six-eight new sanitary landfills by the end of 2014.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The main objectives of the proposed Project were to: (a) cost effectively improve solid waste
services in participating priority areas; (b) increase administrative and technical capacity for
solid waste management at the local and Entity level; (c) improve cost recovery in the sector and
encourage private sector involvement; and (d) correct environmental problems and reduce health
hazards caused by inadequate waste collection and disposal systems.

Key performance indicators related to: (a) solid waste disposal (establishment of multi-municipal
waste management districts, regional landfill sites, and transfer stations; reduction in the number
of wild dumpsites); (b) institutional strengthening (strengthening of appropriate institutions to
manage solid waste services, preparation of business plans for future development of waste
disposal sites, education and public awareness campaigns); (c) cost recovery (establishment of a
cost-recovery system and an agreed program for its gradual improvement; billing and collection
statistics); and (d) private sector involvement (service contracts, recycling and selected other
joint ventures with domestic or foreign private companies).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The Project was expected to benefit the population as a whole through improvements in
environmentally sustainable and cost-effective solid waste management services. By the end of
the Project, more than 800,000 people (later revised to 1.7 million) were to have access to better
solid waste management services. They would also enjoy public health benefits from the closure
of wild dumps located throughout cities and villages. In rural areas and in smaller districts, the
target population included those living in the vicinity of wild dumpsites, particularly women and
children who normally were responsible for waste disposal. The population and, in the long run,
the tourism industry were expected to benefit from clean and aesthetically pleasing surroundings.
Benefits would also accrue through appropriate planning of future development geared to BiH
needs and capacity through the phased approach of medium and long-term plans based on
appropriate technology, affordability and environmental protection.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component A (Waste Management) invested in rehabilitation of existing disposal sites, wild
dump closures, collection infrastructure and support equipment, and transfer stations. This
component financed civil works and equipment and accounted for 83.8 percent of total Bank
financing.

Component B (Institutional Strengthening) included preparation of a Medium-Term Business
Plan that outlaid a Government strategic plan for the medium-term development of a Solid Waste
Management system. This sub-component also involved development of financial management
capacity for the system to operate on a commercial basis, including training related to disposal,
landfill operations, closure and design of future landfills. The Institutional Strengthening
Component also financed a Public Communication Program and Environmental Monitoring.

Component C provided Technical Assistance and Engineering Services. This component
accounted for 11.1 percent of total Bank financing and supported the preparation of feasibility
studies, financial, environmental and social assessments of landfill sites and provides support for
bidding procedures for the investments and services provided under Components A and B.

Components D and E assisted with Project implementation through a Project Management Unit
(PMU) and also covered incremental operating costs.

1.6 Revised Components

The Project Components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

As mentioned above, additional financing in an amount of US$8 million equivalent was
approved by the Board of Directors on May 31, 2005.1 The proposed additional credit covered a
financing gap due to the higher costs entailed in the rehabilitation of landfills and clean-up of
wild dumpsites. The Project objectives of the additional financing were the same as for the
original Project. The implementation arrangements of the additional financing remained the
same as for the original credit. The additional financing was scheduled to be implemented from
2005 to 2009.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Background analysis. During Project preparation, a thorough analysis of the sector issues and
Government strategy was undertaken. The analysis also covered institutional arrangements for
waste collection and disposal and made a case for clarifying and strengthening these
arrangements. These institutional aspects would later on become critical in embarking on an
appropriate solid waste management strategy and for designing the SWMP. The analysis also
took into account lessons of experience from other parts of the world. It argued persuasively that
municipal solid waste management is often a costly and challenging problem for local authorities
to deal with. There is low service coverage, especially in low-income neighborhoods. On the
management side there were substantial inefficiencies at the same time that there were
insufficient resources for these services. All these elements made for a very useful background
analysis that formed the basis for a pragmatic project design.

Assessment of Project design. The Project design was satisfactory for a number of reasons. It
was (i) flexible, enabling different municipalities to benefit when they were ready for
participation; (ii) inclusive, creating high level of local ownership; (iii) incremental (instead of a
big bang approach of aiming for full EU Landfill Directive compliance), investments mainly
focused on partial improvements of landfill operations making them highly manageable for local
stakeholders; and (iv) affordable, increase in operational costs and charges were more
manageable. During Project preparation, strong background analysis and attention to lessons of
experience led to a five-pillar strategy for solid waste management in BiH. The PAD discussed
(i) an integrated, comprehensive strategic planning framework to be adopted at the national and
local levels, especially for large cities; (ii) better institutional arrangements in the sector; (iii)
efficient operational management; (iv) effective financial management; and (v) attention to
improving environmental protection.

Given BiH’s political environment, one could argue that this was an ambitious strategy but there
were elements of the strategy, which were necessary because of the structure of the SWM sector.
For example, it is uneconomical to provide sanitary landfills for small population centers.

                                                       4
Therefore, SWMP focused on agglomerating municipalities that could be served by regional
sanitary landfills. To focus on financial sustainability, emphasis was placed on cost recovery
mechanisms even though full cost recovery in public service delivery is a challenge in many
service sectors. This was a positive step embed the idea of sustainability from the very beginning.
Another element that was important revolved around the fragmented governance structure in BiH
and its two entities. An innovative design helped the Project deal with this fragmentation by
setting up inter-municipal boards to oversee regional landfills. These boards provided
municipalities a forum for evolving a shared response to a common problem and for sharing
lessons of experience. Another area in need of attention was to provide greater opportunities for
public participation in the decision-making process, especially for facility siting.

A key problem in SWM is the location of sanitary landfills. Several Bank-supported projects had
suffered time delays as a result of the NIMBY (Not-in-my-backyard) problem, which essentially
means that the public wants a certain service as long as its operations are located as far away
from their homes and businesses. The Project design largely avoided NIMBY problem by
focusing on rehabilitation of existing dumpsites and converting them into controlled landfills.
Another way to deal with NIMBY is through early public involvement during preparation.
According to some stakeholders, more could have been done for public awareness raising at the
preparation stage as opposed to implementation stage. But, except for a couple of sites, the
NIMBY problem was largely avoided due to the design of the Project.

Government commitment. The Government recognized the need to significantly strengthen
BiH's capacity to safely manage its solid wastes. This was identified as a priority in its Economic
Development Strategy Global Framework (EDSGF). The European Union (EU) funded
preparation of a Nationwide Solid Waste Management Strategy in BiH that was completed in
August 2000 and recommended a wide range of technical, institutional and financial upgrading
measures over the next 15-20 years. Different levels of Government remained committed to the
Project throughout the implementation period. By developing a legal framework during Project
implementation, and by facilitating the development of inter-municipal boards, a key
institutional requirement, the authorities showed their serious commitment to the objectives of
SWMP. Counterpart funding was also made available and, as will be discussed later, authorities
in both FBiH and RS agreed to a second Project as a follow-up to SWMP to maintain the
momentum of change in this sector. Interviews with different officials at various levels of
Government indicate that commitment to SWMP was high and achievements of the Project were
well recognized

Risks and mitigation measures. Project design identified several risks including (i) lack of will
of some municipalities to participate in a multi-municipal landfill with the different Cantons and
municipalities; (ii) public’s unwillingness to pay for SWM services; (iii) lack of enforcement and
continued wild dumping; (iv) limited financial and institutional capacity; (v) financial
management capacity of PMU as well as complex governance arrangements. Almost all of these
risks were rated as Substantial. Mitigation measures included continued policy dialogue with
different levels of Government, penalties for wild dumping, public awareness campaigns and
institutional strengthening through training as well as selection of financial management
specialists in advance of Project launch. After taking mitigating actions into consideration, the
Project was rated as moderate risk. While the mitigation measures were useful, with the benefit



                                                5
of hindsight, the SWMP should have been rated a higher risk given the fragmentation of political
space in BiH and the need for cooperation across municipalities and cantons and entities. Cost
recovery risks were also important and, as seen during Project implementation, continue to pose
a challenge to the sustainability of investments. Fortunately, the importance of reforming this
sector to the environment and the economy seems to have strengthened the resolve of different
stakeholders. The appointment of a single project management unit for investments in both FBiH
and RS appears to have helped reduce the key risk of a complicated governance structure. This
appears to have contributed to the success of the Project.

The ICR rates quality at entry as Satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

Implementation efficiency. While the overall Project design focused on bringing together
different municipalities to benefit from economies of scale, this also presented some challenges
for implementation. Solid waste management leads to multiple benefits and beneficiaries can
relate to these instinctively. However, the NIMBY problem and the need to develop consensus
on placement of landfills as well as cost recovery aspects led to protracted discussions in some
instances. Some of this was foreseen as part of the Project’s risk framework. Not all Project sites
faced these challenges and certainly not to the same degree as, for instance, in Tuzla. These
challenges reduced implementation efficiency at least in the early years.

Having said that, implementation arrangements and cooperation between the team and the clients
allowed for close monitoring of the “sub-projects? and adequate intervention/guidance where
needed. In that sense, implementation was smooth, and obstacles such as NIMBY issues
addressed adequately preventing those from blocking project implementation. Public awareness
was considered an important aspect of dealing with the NIMBY problem. However, discussions
with the task team and the PMU and others revealed that public contact was left mostly to the
implementation stage. Furthermore, awareness raising appears to have been more effective at the
local levels but needed to be complemented at a “higher? (Entity) level as well. Nevertheless, a
key design aspect helped improve implementation efficiency. This relates to flexibility in the
design to support more municipalities as they made progress in meeting the criteria for
rehabilitating landfills. This had the effect of rebalancing Project implementation by bringing in
additional sites into the Project and taking into account lessons learned from the implementation
of the original sites.

Implementation delays. In general, implementation progress was good. The Project had a fast
start in Banja Luka, Bijeljina, Sarajevo and Zenica in terms of identification of sites and setting
up inter-municipal boards and associated implementation arrangements. The latter three sites
(along with Bihac) were added to the original sites since they were quick to meet eligibility
criteria for participating in the Project. These regions could advance faster than initially foreseen
and success was achieved in a relatively short period of time. Sarajevo landfill accomplished
excellent operational results, meeting high international standards and functioned as a model for
other Project regions. Inter-municipal boards functioned well and municipalities cooperated with
each other. Disbursement was initially slow, but increased substantially after the MTR. Even so,
implementation was delayed in Tuzla and Livno partly due to resistance of the local community.
At the time of preparation of the Additional Financing (May 2005), the risk of unwillingness of


                                                  6
some municipalities to participate cooperatively was rated as negligible. In light of delays in
some regions, this was probably optimistic. However, persistence in seeking solutions that were
acceptable to all stakeholders and extensive consultation helped resolve the Tuzla landfill issue
and all the money was utilized soon thereafter. By the time of the MTR, key Project targets such
as creation of six multi municipal districts and preparation of cost recovery programs in two
regions had already been met or exceeded.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. The indicators and target values for results monitoring were aligned with Project
design and used to monitor outputs under the Project components. While the monitoring
indicators were supposed to be “outcome? indicators, they were essentially “output? indicators.
Nevertheless, these indicators reflected progress that was envisaged under the Project. The
targets set by the Project were not overly ambitious but were challenging nevertheless given the
base from which the SWMP was starting. By the time of the MTR, the Project was well on its
way to meeting its targets despite facing challenges in the early part of implementation.

M&E implementation. Project monitoring and evaluation (M&E), including preparing progress
monitoring reports was carried out regularly. Target values were identified at Board presentation,
and progress was updated regularly. As mentioned earlier, due to some early delays and the need
for additional resources, some target values had to be changed.

M&E utilization. Monitoring reports were used to measure Project progress. A review of ISRs
indicates that the task team regularly highlighted issues for consideration by management. This
allowed emerging risks to be raised to the level of management and helped the task team seek
guidance whenever required. The PMU also had a good grip on implementation progress by
monitoring reports received from project implementation teams at the regional level.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The Project triggered Bank safeguard policies Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01). A full
Environmental Assessment was carried out.

Environmental safeguards. Specific Environmental Mitigation Plans (EMPs) were completed
for each site in the regions included in the first solid waste management project. Full
Environmental Assessments (EAs) were prepared where the investment required rehabilitation of
a landfill. Each of the landfill sites had a technical and design study that reviewed issues such as
groundwater quality, surface water quality, soil quality and leachate quality. The studies were
prepared by qualified international and local environmental specialists. The Project was in
compliance with Bank environmental safeguards.

Social safeguards. Project sites included were existing landfill sites which were rehabilitated.
The participatory approach utilized during Project preparation laid the foundation for direct
participation by primary stakeholders in project implementation. The Social Assessment
involved direct consultations with households in areas targeted by the Project, heads of industry
and local community groups. The institutional strengthening component of the Project worked
directly with local media, community groups and regional and local government entities to work


                                                 7
collaboratively to inform and educate the public on the need to improve the solid waste
management service system and to change practices of wild dumping. A communications
strategy was designed and detailed the methods for involving these groups in the implementation
of the public information and education campaigns.

Fiduciary compliance

Procurement. The procurement process was handled in a satisfactory manner (including
procurement planning, staffing, filing, and actions/decisions). When considered together with the
contract administration/physical inspections, the overall procurement rating is Satisfactory.

Financial Management and Disbursement. The Project financial management risk was assessed
as Substantial. The recruitment of FM specialists early on, helped reduce this risk. Overall
financial and disbursement arrangements for Project implementation were Satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Countrywide coverage for a sustainable solid waste management system will require substantial
funding for investments. The first Solid Waste Management Project (SWMP), including
additional financing, invested US$26 million in six regional landfills. The SWMP-2, a repeater
operation to scale-up SWMP will invest US$40 million in six to eight more regional landfills,
which will bring BiH closer to achieving full sector coverage.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of PDO. The PDO remains relevant for BiH’s development priorities. BiH identified
solid waste management capacity as a priority and the Project contributed to the goals outlined in
the CPS for 2008-11, which prioritizes investments to improve infrastructure and service
delivery. The Project supports goals under both CPS pillars: under the first pillar, the Project
supports BiH to (i) improve key infrastructure and (ii) strengthen regional cooperation to manage
public goods; under the second, the Project will support BiH to improve municipal services
delivery and strengthen municipal finance. The Project also responds to the EU-financed Solid
Waste Management Strategy recommendations and priorities—to establish waste management
districts through municipal cooperation, and develop regional landfill facilities that serve
multiple municipalities. Furthermore, the Project will contribute to the following higher-level
objectives: (i) improve public health and quality of life by reducing exposure to pollutants and
disease vectors from solid waste; (ii) improve municipal institutional capacity by establishing up-
to-date technical and financial solutions for SWM; (iii) enhance environmental policy by
improving the scope and depth of SWM strategies and facilitating recycling and waste-reduction
programs nationwide; and (iv) improve local governance by enhancing cooperation among
municipalities.

Relevance of design. Regional sanitary landfills are the backbone of an environmentally and
financially sustainable solid waste management system. Shared sanitary landfills provide a



                                                8
higher level of environmental protection and are more affordable due to economies of scale and
joint cost savings—particularly important given the considerable number of smaller
municipalities that constitute BiH. In addition, emphasis on cost recovery mechanisms at the
design stage helped establish some benchmarks for Project implementation. The SWMP
exemplifies good cooperation mechanisms: special agreements were crafted to develop shared
transfer and disposal facilities. These inter-municipal agreements include joint decision-making
and cost-sharing mechanisms to finance and operate regional landfills. Furthermore, site
selection was embedded in outreach and consultation processes with local inhabitants and NGOs.
This approach was also used for SWMP-2. In addition, a legal framework for solid waste
management began to take shape after the Project was conceptualized. Prior to that, the country
only had a strategy in place. Design relevance is rated High.

Relevance of implementation. Implementation largely focused on the Waste Management
component due to its high priority for Government and importance for environmental
sustainability. Technical assistance and engineering services provided critical complementary
services. Various training workshops were organized during project implementation. These were
attended by representatives of utilities, PITs and PMU. Knowledge sharing in the form of joint
annual review meetings with all utilities/PITs/PMU was held and a community of practice
appears to have taken shape for the purpose of sharing implementation experiences. However, in
reviewing the record of Project implementation, the ICR team came away with the impression
that more could have been done on raising public awareness given the centrality of the NIMBY
problem to solid waste management projects. Discussions with the task team, PMU, and other
stakeholders revealed that public outreach could have been initiated during project preparation.
Also, the focus initially seems to have been on the technical merits of SWMP and it became
apparent during implementation that the “softer? side, involving stakeholder outreach was just as
important. Public awareness campaigns were well designed in some regions (Banja Luka,
Bijeljina, Sarajevo, and Zenica). But, raising awareness beyond the local levels could have
ensured smoother implementation. In addition, Project documentation has been better at
capturing activities associated with landfill rehabilitation as opposed to public outreach. Perhaps
it is because landfill rehabilitation is more tangible in terms of funds disbursement and ease of
measuring outputs, but public outreach is an enabling tool and will remain important for
embedding good practices related to waste generation, collection, and disposal.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Overall achievement of PDO. The PDOs have been achieved, and some target values have been
exceeded. In line with Project objectives, the quality and availability of solid waste services is
much improved. As a result of the Project, there is a legal and institutional framework that
underpins further development of the sector. As discussed elsewhere, cost recovery remains a
problem but at least now a basis for financial sustainability of regional landfills has been
established. With greater awareness of the benefits of SWM services, there is recognition of the
need to pay for these services. With the closure of wild dumpsites and tighter enforcement,
environmental problems have been addressed to a large extent and health hazards have been
reduced. Overall PDO achievement is Satisfactory.

In terms of specific PDO indicators, the first indicator related to establishment of regional
landfills and reduction of wild dumpsites. Six regional landfills were targeted to be operational


                                                9
by the end of the Project. This target was achieved. In addition, eight multi-municipal districts
were established under the Project and 10 percent of reduction in wild dumpsites was achieved
against a target of five percent reduction.

The second PDO indicator related to strengthening appropriate institutions to manage solid waste
services, development of business plans, and implementation of education and public awareness
campaigns. The Project Management Unit and Project Implementation Teams and multi-
municipal boards were established. Four business plans for utilities were completed while local
education and public awareness campaigns were completed in five regions. The "NIMBY"
campaign was conducted in the Federation in 2008-2009 and is still underway.

The third PDO related to financial sustainability of utilities supported by the Project. Cost-
recovery programs were prepared in four regions although admittedly financial sustainability of
the utilities will be an ongoing concern. Waste separation program was started in five regions
and recycling facilities were installed and operational in four regions.

The identification and closure of wild dumpsites was the main focus of the fourth indicator.
While the target was for identification of all wild dumpsites, eighty percent were identified in the
Project areas. In addition, 32 wild dumps were cleaned and closed in the Banja Luka region, 112
in Sarajevo region and 15 in Zenica region.

3.3 Efficiency

The analysis of partial-year 2010 summary financial results of four regional landfills indicates
that these regional landfill utilities operate in financially sustainable manner, fully recovering
their operating costs including depreciation. However, it should be noted that these are early
results from a subset of investments. During meetings with counterparts, financial sustainability
of the investments was raised as an ongoing concern. As with other public services, SWM
utilities will face challenges associated with financial sustainability, at least in the initial years of
operation. In addition to the financial performance assessment of regional landfill utilities, cost
effectiveness approach was used to evaluate the efficiency of the Project and to compare the
outcome with the assessment at appraisal stage. Based on the per capita investments metric, the
Project performed better than expected in most regions. Annex 3 describes the financial and
economic analysis of the Project investments.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: The ICR rates the Overall Outcome of the Project Satisfactory.

Sector-wide improvements, not to mention reforms, in solid waste management are complex and
time consuming. To achieve sector improvements, time-lines up to 10 years are not exceptional.
In light of this, the SWMP has been very successful in a complex political environment. The
Project was relevant for the sustainable development of Bosnia-Herzegovina and it remains so
even today. The SWMP-2 has been approved to expand on the activities of SWMP. The design
of the Project was sound and pragmatic. Rehabilitation of existing landfills and bringing together
multiple municipalities to benefit from economies of scale were important pieces of a sound
strategy.


                                                   10
As discussed in section 3.2, the PDOs have been met and some targets have been exceeded.
Project implementation has not been without challenges but perseverance on the part of
stakeholders and dedicated support from the task team ensured the success of the Project. A
flexible Project design allowed new regions to participate in the Project as soon as they met
eligibility criteria. Therefore, on account of a relevant design, achievement of objectives, and
overall efficiency of implementation, the ICR rates Project outcome as satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Not applicable

(b) Institutional Change / Strengthening

The PDO emphasized strengthening institutional capacity, including cost recovery and raising
awareness of the importance of solid waste management services in BiH. On all accounts,
progress can be deemed satisfactory. The establishment of inter-municipal structures provides an
example of how different levels of Government can work together. In the difficult area of
creating a culture of paying for SWM services, even though much more needs to be done, a lot of
progress has been made and a basis for full cost recovery in the future has been established.
Dealing with the NIMBY problem has made municipal and other authorities much more aware
of the importance of participatory processes in developing solutions for the delivery of public
services. In these respects, the Project has performed satisfactorily.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Donors have stepped up to bring in further support and further discussions are taking place; the
Bank is seen as the leading party in this sector in BiH and the Project resulted in a successor
project. The Bank is serving as a catalyst for securing other donor financing for well-coordinated,
high-priority and economically and financially justified, investments. While this last advantage
did not come to fruition initially, there is increased donor interest in solid waste management
services these days. For example, the Swedish Government, through SIDA, is implementing a
EUR 10 million project in support of SWMP to assist municipalities in those regions that have
constructed regional landfills (initially, in the regions of Zenica and Bijeljina). A SIDA
representative confirmed that the agency would not have participated in SWM if the Bank was
not already financing this activity.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

The final implementation support and implementation completion mission was conducted from
June 7-11, 2010. As part of this mission, an implementation completion workshop was organized
at which participants shared lessons of experience related to Project implementation and
discussed ways to incorporate these lessons to implement the Second Solid Waste Management
Project (SWMP-2).



                                               11
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: The risk to development outcome is rated low. The SWMP has received high marks
from counterparts at different levels of Government as well as from other donors. The outcome
of the Project has been positive and has yielded greater awareness about the importance of
managing waste in a sanitary way, reduced wild dumping, improved the infrastructure of
landfills, created the institutional capacity in this area, and taken important steps towards
financial sustainability of SWM utilities. There is concern about cost recovery issues and the
need for founders of regional landfills to ensure adequate capital contributions for and greater
investment in public utilities. These issues will be critical for the sustainability of Project
outcomes as well as to the success of this sector in general.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Project-financed investments were highly relevant and are beginning to leverage
resources from other donors; implementation arrangements for the SWMP were well thought out
and quite innovative and Project implementation progressed satisfactorily after some delays in
disbursements in the early period. The Project design was reasonable and based on the sound
premise that economies of scale needed to be exploited in the area of SWM to adapt to the
limited resources available. Institutional arrangements were good and tailored to achieve the
broader PDO. The lending instrument was well suited to support the PDOs and attention was
devoted during preparation to institutional capacity building activities without which the Project
would not progress well. The ICR rates Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry as
Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: During implementation, the Bank team performed regular supervision missions, and
noted throughout the implementation period, delays or any other issues that required managerial
attention or some form of resolution. In this context, the delays in Bihac and Tuzla, on account
of resistance by local populations and/or authorities to the development of sanitary landfills at
particular sites led the task team to initiate thinking on ways to move forward either by
reallocating resources or other means. Such proactivity is welcome and should be commended.
Overall, the ICR rates the quality of Bank supervision as Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: The ICR rates overall Bank performance as Satisfactory, based on a satisfactory rating of
Bank performance to ensure quality at entry, and a satisfactory rating of quality of supervision,
and an overall satisfactory Project outcome rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance



                                                12
Rating: Government performance is rated Satisfactory. Throughout the implementation of the
Project, Government counterparts in FBiH and RS, and at local levels, showed a high degree of
commitment to the Project. A clear sign of such commitment was when a single PMU was
selected to support project implementation in both entities. There was good cooperation with the
Bank team and issues were dealt with in a collaborative manner. The PMU in particular
functioned well and was able to work with the different utilities in a collegial manner. This was
quite important considering that political difficulties sometimes led to fragmentation of activities
leading to higher costs and lack of knowledge sharing between officials in the two entities. This
was a good result and helped establish a good base for other phases of SWMP.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Performance of the implementing agency is rated Highly Satisfactory. A single
implementing agency was responsible for implementing the Project, and all Project fiduciary
aspects including financial management and procurement functions. The efforts of the
implementing agency were widely appreciated by officials in both FBiH and the RS as well as by
World Bank staff.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Overall Borrower Performance is rated Satisfactory, based on a satisfactory rating of
Government performance and a satisfactory rating of implementing agency performance, and an
overall satisfactory Project outcome rating.

6. Lessons Learned

   (i) Strong sector analysis is a prerequisite to good project design. The SWMP was
           conceived after what appears to be careful consideration of the needs and possibilities
           of the SWM sector. While there was an EU-funded national strategy to draw on, key
           lessons of experience as well as close attention to the political realities of BiH helped
           shape SWMP. There was no quick fix to the problem of solid wastes in the country
           particularly as financial resources were limited. To overcome these issues, a phased
           approach to providing solid waste services was adopted. Also, experience suggested
           that to address the NIMBY problem, construction of new landfills was less appealing.
           Therefore rehabilitation of existing sites was preferred. It was also not feasible to
           provide these services without bringing together multiple municipalities within
           cooperative arrangements. That helped bring together municipalities to share regional
           landfills. All of these aspects point to good analysis and attention to the political
           economy of the country and appears to be an obvious lesson from SWMP.

   (ii) Post-conflict situations are challenging but can also present opportunities. As mentioned
           in different parts of the ICR, the Project promoted regional landfills and utilities for
           different reasons. This was for the first time in BiH that municipalities decided to join
           and share a joint landfill, managed by a joint, regional utility. While the economies of
           scale argument is important for developing sustainable landfills, the reconciliation
           aspect is particularly important in the context of BiH because it fostered cooperation
           between municipalities, utilities, governments at different levels and contributed to


                                                13
       reconciliation in the post-conflict country. Project preparation and implementation
       started only six years after the formal end of the war. Communication between
       institutions and authorities had broken down and economic and political space was
       fragmented and remains so to a large extent. After implementation started, regular
       annual meetings were held, site visits were conducted and people from both entities
       started cooperating closely and lessons of experience were exchanged. Even a cross-
       entity landfill (Bijeljina) was established. These are small but important milestones
       that can keep progress alive in bringing people together. BH’s challenges are
       significant but the work of the SWMP is a positive contribution in a difficult
       environment.

(iii) A gradual approach to reforms may be appropriate in difficult political environments or
         new sector engagements. The SWMP is a great example of building a phased
         approach to improving service delivery in a country with a challenging political
         environment and where solid waste services were not developed. Instead of
         establishing one or two cutting edge landfills in one area or trying to develop a big
         sector-wide program, the SWMP invested in several regions in parallel and at
         different levels of advancement. Such an approach was less capital sustainability
         perspective. Operating costs were kept down and allowed for further gradual
         improvements. It is important to implement parallel, gradual tariff increases for
         services which a population is more likely to accept paying for once they see positive
         results. In addition, that approach created (i) competition between regions; and (ii)
         facilitated learning between more and less advanced regions.

(iv) Client ownership matters greatly. While this lesson is widely disseminated within the
         Bank, its practical application in the case of the SWMP was critical to the Project’s
         success. Only a few years removed from a devastating war, the authorities in FBiH
         and the RS chose to not only request the Bank’s support in a very new area of public
         service delivery from the country’s perspective but also demonstrated an ongoing
         commitment to its goals. Establishing a single PMU for both the FBiH’s and RS’s
         activities was almost inconceivable at that time. This helped greatly in facilitating the
         implementation of the Project. Local level authorities also did their part by
         understanding the need to forming inter-municipal structures for governing landfills.
         There was also a lot of effort in helping identify landfill sites and helping deal with
         concerns raised by residents close to these sites. Without the active involvement of
         local officials, the SWMP would certainly not been successful. Of course, the reason
         clients were supportive of this Project was that it was consistent with their priorities.
         Otherwise, BiH’s administrative fragmentation can present challenges to the most
         well designed projects.

(v) Transparency in eligibility criteria for participation in the SWMP created a positive
       incentive for municipalities. The Project started with three regions that had met
       eligibility criteria for receiving investments. By establishing transparent criteria, the
       SWMP provided a roadmap for municipalities to receive much-needed, low cost
       investments in the solid waste sector. This positive incentive helped municipalities
       come together, work out solutions for identification of Project sites, evolve joint



                                             14
         decision making, and transcend administrative barriers. The selection criteria also
         seem to have created some competition between municipalities as they tried to secure
         investments from a limited pool of funds. In municipal services, this competitive
         element of selection criteria can be useful not only in BiH but also in other countries.

(vi) Ensure that risk mitigation measures are more than a hoped for outcome. Many key risks
        were correctly identified during Project preparation. However, the effectiveness of
        mitigation measures was in some instances perhaps considered in an optimistic light.
        For example, public awareness campaigns were considered a risk mitigating measure
        to deal with the NIMBY problem. However, describing the mitigation measures is not
        the same as implementing such measures effectively. Interviews with the PMU
        suggested that some of the problems encountered during the early part of Project
        implementation could have been avoided if public awareness and education had been
        initiated earlier during preparation. And, local politics may have also played a part in
        blunting some of the effect of awareness raising efforts. This is not to suggest that
        mitigation measures were not well thought out. To the contrary, most mitigation
        measures were good. But, even when such measures are described, their
        implementation also can impact a project’s progress.

(vii)    Be candid and proactive. The task team is to be commended for highlighting issues in
         ISRs as they arose and to seek management guidance when appropriate. This is a
         good practice to emulate and helped the Project remain on track even though there
         were initial delays and disbursements had not picked up speed even until the mid-
         term review. Specifically, when the implementation of the Tuzla subcomponent
         faced continuing problems, the task team identified the causes for management by
         writing in an ISR that “a small group of villagers is opposed to the landfill’s
         rehabilitation due to its proximity to their village. A tremendous amount of work has
         been done on communication/interaction by the FBH Ministry of Environment, Tuzla
         Canton and the local Government in trying to reach a mutual understanding. The task
         team has informed the Tuzla implementing team that if the issue is not resolved, then
         an alternative location from the previous short-list of locations must be found.
         Meanwhile, the FBH Ministry of Environment, Tuzla Canton, PMU and task team
         will continue to work together to provide all relevant support to implementation of
         this sub-component.? By identifying the problem and developing options to deal with
         delays could only have reassured management that the team was fully engaged in the
         resolution of such issues. This allowed management to support the task team and the
         result has been one of the most successful Bank-supported projects in BiH.

(viii)   Stability in task management can help project implementation. A key ingredient in
         the Project’s success has been the dedicated effort of both the PMU and the Bank
         team. A potential problem in Bank projects can be due to task management becoming
         discontinuous once a project is prepared and under implementation. In the case of
         SWMP, task management was passed on from the Team Leader to a member of the
         original team that helped prepare the Project. This combined with task management
         eventually shifting to the country office helped greatly with project implementation.
         Projects such as the SWMP require a level of contact with clients that may not be

           optimally provided from Washington. Discussions with clients revealed that an
           ongoing, almost daily dialogue helped resolve many issues that threatened to delay
           implementation or could have resulted in a less satisfactory project. Even with the
           best of intentions, a task manager may not have been able to fully deal with the
           number of complex issues that came up during implementation. A strong sector
           presence in the field was very much needed for the success of the SWMP.

The PAD established the following key indicators as measures of achieving the Project’s defined
objectives:

Waste Management (A):
1. The number of multi-municipal waste management districts established: the target value was
   six districts, and eight such districts have been established.
2. The number of regional landfills operational: while the target was four regional landfills, six
   have been established by the end of the Project.



                                                          3
3. The reduction of wild dump sites: 15% reduction in wild dump sites was targeted and
   achieved.
4. Disposal of waste in environmentally sound manner: the Project targeted and achieved nearly
   50% of waste disposal in environmentally sound manner.

Institutional Strengthening (B):
1. Strengthening of appropriate institutions to manage solid waste services: PMU and PITs have
    been established; six utilities are already generating income
2. Preparation of business plans for future development of waste disposal sites: four business
    plans for utilities have been completed under the Project.
3. Education and public awareness campaigns: local education and public awareness campaigns
    have been completed in 5 regions.

Cost recovery (C):
1. Programs to achieve gradual cost-recovery: cost-recovery programs have been prepared for
   four regions.
2. Recycling awarded to either foreign or domestic private firms: separation programs started in
   five regions, and recycling facilities are installed and operational in four regions.
3. At least 75% of population in Project areas paying regularly for services by the end of the
   Project: according to the latest estimates, about 70% of population in Project areas now
   regularly pays for waste disposal service.
4. But, sustainability of landfills and the overall cost recovery mechanism requires additional
   time to take hold. This is an area that was on the minds of many stakeholders that held
   discussions with the ICR team. No doubt, much progress has been made but financial
   sustainability is still elusive at this point.

Correct environmental problems and reduce health hazards caused by inadequate waste
collection and disposal systems (D):
1. Wild waste dumps closed and monitoring of groundwater being undertaken regularly: about
    80% of wild dumpsites in Project areas have been identified; 32 wild dumps were cleaned
    and closed in Banja Luka region, 112 dumps were cleaned and closed in Sarajevo region, and
    15 dumps were cleaned and closed in Zenica region. One of the largest wild dump sites in
    the country (Knezevo) has been closed in a sanitary manner, and design work for the closure
    of Mezdre wild dump site has been completed. Monitoring plans for closed sites have also
    been prepared.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Financial Evaluation. The analysis of partial-year 2010 summary financial results of four
regional landfills indicates that these regional landfill utilities operate in financially sustainable
manner, fully recovering their operating costs including depreciation. The following section
briefly describes the overall financial performance of these four regional landfills: Banja Luka,
Bijeljina, Moscanica, and Tuzla. It should be noted that this analysis is based on aggregated and
summary-level financial results for six months of 2010. At the time of the analysis, detailed
financial results were not available for further analysis.

Banja Luka Regional Landfill. Banja Luka regional landfill was established by eight municipal
entities. The municipality of Banja Luka is the main shareholder with 62% of the shares. The
analysis of summary financial results for partial year 2010 indicates that the utility is operating in
a financially sustainable manner and is fully recovering all of its operating costs, including
depreciation. For the period of January to June 2010, the utility reported KM 1,071,088 operating
revenue and KM 891,855 operating expenses including depreciation. Cash operating expenses,
which exclude depreciation expense, were KM 683,610. This results in operating ratio of 0.83
and financial working ratio of 0.64. In other words, better than full cost recovery was achieved in
this period. Personnel expenses are the largest expense item for this utility as well, at 53% of
total operating expenses and almost 70% of cash operating expenses.

Bijeljina Regional Landfill. Bijeljina regional landfill was established by six municipal entities.
The municipality of Bijeljina is the largest shareholder with 67% of the shares. The analysis of
summary financial results for partial year 2010 indicates that the utility is fully recovering all of
its operating costs, including depreciation. For the period of January to June 2010, the utility
reported KM 494,001 operating revenue and KM 460,814 operating expenses including
depreciation. Cash operating expenses, which exclude depreciation expense, were KM 313,477.
This results in operating ratio of 0.93 and financial working ratio of 0.68, indicating full cost
recovery. Cost of salaries and compensation, at 45% of the total (66% of cash costs), is the
largest contributor to the utility’s operating costs.

Zenica Regional Landfill. The analysis of summary financial results of Moscanica Utility for
partial year 2010 indicates that the utility is operating in a financially sustainable manner and is
fully recovering all of its operating costs. For the period of January to June 2010, the utility
reported KM 892,944 operating revenue and KM 718,488 operating expenses, resulting in
operating ratio of 0.86. More detailed financial reports for further analysis were not available.

Tuzla Regional Landfill. This regional landfill has only recently started operating, and only one
month of financial results were available at the time of writing. Based on this limited data, the
utility is operating in a financially sustainable manner and is fully recovering all of its operating
costs, including depreciation. For the month of September 2010, the utility reported KM 136,872
operating revenue and KM 107,840 operating expenses, resulting in operating ratio of 0.79. Cash
operating expenses, which exclude depreciation expense, were KM 42,800, resulting in the
financial working ratio of 0.31.




                                                  5
Economic Analysis. At the appraisal stage, as well as at the project’s conclusion, the customary
economic cost-benefit analysis was attempted on the basis of annual flows of economic benefits
and costs. However, the available data did not permit such analysis. Besides, improved solid
waste management generates other economic benefits that are difficult or impossible to quantify
and monetize for the purposes of economic analysis. These benefits include the reduction in
environmental damage, improved public health, as well as intangible esthetic benefits that arise
from having cleaner cities and surrounding areas that result from the reduction of uncontrolled
dumping. While some of these benefits may be captured through the solid waste management
fees that consumers pay, the user fees are highly unlikely to fully capture the environmental and
health benefits of improved solid waste management. Individual consumers often lack the
information to assess the total costs and risks to themselves, the economy, and the environment
that lack of safe and sustainable solid waste management causes. In addition, besides being
difficult to quantify, improvements environmental and health conditions may also be influenced
by a variety of confounding factors besides solid waste management, which makes it difficult to
isolate and quantify the positive impact of improved solid waste management from the impact of
other factors.

For the above reasons, cost effectiveness approach, instead of the cost-benefit analysis, was used
to gauge the effectiveness of the Project investments. The initial analysis at the appraisal stage
computed per capita investments to evaluate whether the investments were efficiently sized to
meet the demand for solid waste collection and disposal services. The per capita investment costs
for the Project utilities ranged from USD 12.50 to USD 30 at the Project appraisal stage.

Cost effectiveness evaluation. Two of the three solid waste management projects that were
reviewed at the appraisal stage have significantly lower final per capita investment costs
compared to the appraisal per capita investment cost estimates. The estimated appraisal per
capita investment costs were USD 13.83, USD 12.50, and USD 30 for Banja-Luka, Mostar, and
Tuzla, respectively. The final per capita investment costs for the three municipalities are USD
7.92, USD 5.16, and USD 34.5.

The lower final per capita investment figures in two municipalities are mainly due to
significantly less total Project investments in two out of the three areas compared to the initially
planned total investments. The higher per capita cost in Tuzla is due to slightly higher final
investment cost. The total Project investments for the three cities were estimated at the appraisal
stage at USD 3.7 million for Banja-Luka, USD1.5 million for Mostar, and USD 6 million for
Tuzla. The final total investment figures are only USD 3.17 million, USD 0.62 million, and
about USD 6.9 million for the three cities, respectively. The per capita investment figure for
Banja-Luka was further decreased by the higher actual number of benefiting population than was
initially estimated, due to the fact that the initial estimates did not appear to include other
neighboring municipalities that also benefit from the regional solid waste utility. The total
population of the eight municipalities in the Banja-Luka region that share the regional utility is
about 400,000, while the initial estimate of benefiting population in this regions was about half
that many.

The Project investments were from the outset designed to minimize incremental costs necessary
to achieve the PDOs. The Project focused on existing landfill rehabilitation as opposed to



                                                 6
construction of new landfills. This approach allowed for a better targeting of investments in
order to maximize the utilization of existing assets. This strategy reflected a calculated decision
not to invest in costly high-technology waste processing options and concentrate the available
resources towards the most cost efficient solutions. The landfills to be rehabilitated under the
Project were selected with the view of minimizing the incremental costs per capita of population
served. To this end, a proper balance was struck between the economies of scale of combining
landfills for a number of municipalities, which would reduce investment costs per capita given
the high economies of scale.

Considering that (a) it was not possible to perform a more thorough cost-benefit analysis either at
the outset or at the conclusion of the Project, (b) least cost approach was adopted during the
Project design, target utility selection, and Project implementation processes, and (c) the final per
capita investment costs are in most cases significantly lower than the initial estimates which were
made with cost efficiency in mind, the Project performed well and met cost efficiency criterion
set at the Project appraisal stage.

I PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.1 GENERAL PROJECT DATA

   The Solid Waste Management Strategy in BiH, drafted in 2000, and financed by the
European Commission, envisages solid waste management at the regional level, i.e. the
construction of 16 regional sanitary landfills.

    Pursuant to the Strategy, the World Bank had approved credit funds under IDA terms for
Bosnia and Herzegovina to finance the construction of regional sanitary landfills in line with the
current EU standards for the area in question. The project envisaged the rehabilitation of existing
landfills and establishment of regional sanitary landfills for solid waste disposal.

    The entity level waste management strategy in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
was adopted in 2009, while Republika Srpska accepted the strategy drafted in 2000 by the
European Commission. Both entity strategies envisage the disposal of solid waste in regional
sanitary landfills. The Federal Ministry of Environment and Tourism drafted the Law on
Amendments and Addenda to the Law on Waste Management in FBiH, in which appropriate
harmonization with the EU/EC directives was performed.

    The Development Credit Agreement was signed on July 12, 2002, and the planned date of
project closing was June 30, 2010. The Agreement comprises of the initial credit, IDA 36720
BOS, in the value of US$ 18.0, and the additional credit, IDA 3672-1 BOS, in the amount of
US$ 8.0 million, signed on November 25, 2005, with entity governments contribution financing
in the amount of US$ 4.3 million.

              municipalities in the region of Bijeljina)

1.2 IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

      The Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska had agreed that project implementation
would be performed by a single project management unit – the PMU (Project Management Unit),
which was formed in the Federation of BiH with experts from the Federation of BiH and
representatives of RS, and under the supervision of the relevant entity ministries.

1.3 PROJECT REALIZATION

       The Solid Waste Management Project had been declared a high risk project, both because
of the project matter, the lack of well defined regulations, and because of the implementation
arrangements that were applied as such for the very first time. Numerous difficulties had
occurred during project implementation and they slowed down the activities planned in
individual regions, while in other regions project implementation progressed quite well.

        Thanks to extraordinary efforts invested by the members of the PMU team, successful
cooperation with the regions involved in the project, and with relevant ministries and
governments, overall project implementation was rated as successful, both by the relevant
ministries, and by the World Bank.

        In recognition of the successful realization, the Solid Waste Management Project was
recognized as a winner at the first annual World Bank contest for „Improving the lives of people
in the European and Central Asia Region“ in March, 2008, together with two other projects from
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

       As a result of slower project implementation in the regions of Tuzla and Livno an
application for an extension of the timeframe for project finalization was sent to the World Bank.
The application for extension was approved by the World Bank in July of 2009, and the new
closing date was set to June 30, 2010.

(FBIH+RS)

Upon the finalization of the first phase of project implementation, one can conclude that,
speaking of the scope and the quantity of work, a lot more was done than planned. The project
was implemented in eight regions, instead of three, as was initially planned in the project. Works
were completed in the three regions that are operational (Sarajevo, Zenica, Bijeljina), and waste
is being disposed in five regions. In addition to the three aforementioned regions, there are also
the regions of Banja Luka and Tuzla. In the course of the final year of project implementation,
the region of Tuzla had ensured the conditions necessary for the recycling of 150 tons of waste
per day and improved the conditions of waste collection for three municipalities by procuring
new vehicles and containers for waste transport. The region of Mostar is in the initial phase of
preparations necessary for creating the preconditions for high quality waste disposal.

Attempting to analyze the operations of regional landfills that are operational and are already
disposing waste, it may be noted that further improvements are needed to achieve full cost
recovery, in the sense of self sustainability and efficient coverage of all the operational costs,
including the repayment of the credit in semi-annual annuities. Reports on operations of those
companies, with financial indicators, present their performance without losses, but those
indicators fail to include the amounts of annuities for credit repayment that shall have to start
being paid from October 2010. There are few options for increasing the level of financial
efficiency, and some of them shall be discussed in the text below:

- The percentage of coverage of waste collection is low, especially in rural areas and that results
in the total quantity of collected waste being reduced, and therefore the percentage of collected
revenues is reduced, and consequently it reduces the total funding required for regular waste
disposal.


                                                 15
- Collection rate differs significantly and shows significant variations between municipalities,
which has a direct effect on the possibility of paying for waste disposal. All the options are still
being used (non-sanitary landfills, wild dumpsites) with the objective of delivering the smallest
possible quantity of waste to regional landfills.
- Upon creating sanitary conditions for waste disposal, the price of waste disposal should have
been increased, and it is in direct relation with the total quantity of waste delivered. Larger
quantities (exceeding 200 tons per day) facilitate reduced prices of waste disposal.
- The public awareness campaign on the level of BiH represents a very significant segment of the
entire project. Good, high quality campaign should make the problem more immediately present
and easier to understand to all the inhabitants of BiH, taking care that all the age groups are
covered. A good campaign would facilitate resolution of initial problems in the regions in which
the project should be implemented, by encouraging citizens to accept high quality waste disposal.
That primarily implies informing the local population of the need to identify a location site for
regional landfill, as well as creating the conditions for separated waste collection.
- The current legal regulations on mandatory sanitary disposal of solid waste shall become
effective at the beginning of 2012, and by that time options shall remain open for municipalities
to avoid the delivery of entire quantities of waste collected to regional landfills.

RESULTS OF REALIZATION
I)     Assessment of project objectives, design, implementation and operational
experiences.
Components planned in the Project:
- waste management, with the following sub-components: rehabilitation of existing landfills and
construction of regional sanitary landfills, closing of waste dumpsites, strengthening of
infrastructure for waste collection and procurement of appropriate equipment, construction of
transfer stations.
- institutional strengthening: including the public campaign and environment protection
monitoring, drafting of mid-term business plans.
- engineering services – technical assistance.

During the implementation all the above mentioned components were mostly implemented
successfully, with just a few exceptions.

The rehabilitation of existing landfills, together with the establishment of regional landfills, as
the main and the most important activity under the project, was implemented very successfully
on five locations, Banja Luka, Sarajevo, Bijeljina, Mostar, and Zenica. In locations in Tuzla and
Livno the implementation was partially successful because of the problems with the local
population concerning the acceptance of construction of regional landfills at originally identified
locations.

Following the development of regional landfills and after creating the conditions necessary for
sanitary waste disposal, cleaning of wild dumpsites was performed very successfully in the
regions of Banja Luka, Sarajevo, and Zenica. In the region of Bijeljina a snapshot of the situation
of wild dumpsites was made, and it was concluded that a very large number existed, containing
large quantities of waste and covering a large area, and as a result their clearing would have



                                                16
required significant financial resources, and at this time the resources were spent more rationally
on finalizing the construction of the regional landfill.

The procurement of equipment for improving the conditions of waste collection primarily
concerned the procurement of appropriate containers for waste collection of various volumes.
Containers were procured in the regions of Bihać, Banja Luka, Bijeljina, and Tuzla. By
procuring various types of vehicles for waste transport, the region of Tuzla has significantly
facilitated and improved the conditions of transport for utility companies in municipalities that
transport and dispose waste in the regional landfill in Tuzla.

Construction of regional landfills in certain regions created the conditions necessary for the
construction of transfer stations, specifically in the regions of Zenica (Travnik, Novi Travnik,
and Vitez) and Tuzla (Grada?ac). The construction of those transfer stations and others shall,
understandingly, primarily depend on financial resources that shall be available to regions
involved in the second phase of the Project.

The envisaged concept of municipality associations and the forming of inter-municipal councils
comprising of municipalities gravitating to individual regional landfills was confirmed as
necessary. Mutual agreements were signed, defining the rights and obligations of municipalities,
and those agreements stipulated that the obligation of the regional landfill was to accept all the
quantities of waste collected from each of the municipalities, and therefore create the
preconditions necessary for economic sustainability and the execution of obligations concerning
the repayment of credit funds. The issue relating to the readiness of municipalities to deliver all
the waste collected is still under disputable, because of the significant increase of the price of
waste disposal. Prior to the construction of regional landfills, the price of waste disposal in the
majority of regions was symbolic, primarily because of the unsanitary method of disposal used,
lacking any provisions for the protection of air, soil, or water. After the construction of regional
landfills, the price of disposal had to be increased, by a percentage that varies and primarily
depends on the quantities being disposed daily at the landfill. The quantities of 150-200 tons per
day, envisaged by the Project, would facilitate the price of disposal remaining within acceptable
limits, while the disposal of quantities below 150 tons per day would result in a significant
increase of the price of disposal.

The public campaign on the construction of regional landfills and better and safer waste disposal
was implemented separately for each region. Most of those campaigns were successful and,
based on those experiences, it seems that a campaign on the state level could have better and
more permanent results.

As agreed by the two relevant entity ministries, project implementation was performed by the
Project Management Unit (PMU) located in the Federal Ministry of Physical Planning and
Environment. The PMU employed trained staff from FBiH and RS. Project Implementation
Teams (PITs) were formed for each individual region and they were working under direct
supervision of the PMU and in close cooperation with the PMU. That model was proven as very
successful, which is evident in the successful implementation of the project overall. There had
been evident difficulties in the beginning of project implementation and they had, for the most
part, resulted from the lack of experience and the lack of knowledge of the substance of waste



                                                17
management. High quality training of staff for procurement and finance in both the PMU and the
PITs represents an important precondition for overcoming initial problems more easily.

II)    Assessment of project outcomes in comparison with agreed objectives.
A general analysis of project outcomes in comparison agreed objectives shows that the planned
objectives were achieved, with certain exceptions. Those exceptions primarily concern the
construction of transfer stations, the state level public campaign, and the development of the
mid-term business plan.

Speaking of the transfer stations, the construction of regional landfills in certain regions created
the preconditions necessary for the construction of transfer stations, specifically in the regions of
Zenica (Travnik, Novi Travnik, and Vitez) and Tuzla (Gradaćac). It is understandable that the
construction of those and other transfer stations shall primarily depend on financial resources
that shall be available to the regions involved in the second phase of the Project.

The public campaign on the state level was not implemented because of the lack of
understanding amongst the regions of the significance of implementation of that activity. The
majority of them were of the opinion that campaigns on the local level would be sufficient. Later
on, after certain problems in project implementation had shown that a public campaign on the
state level was necessary, and it shall be implemented in the course of the second phase of the
Project.

Business plans were developed for individual regions, but not for BiH.
Upon completing the necessary activities in all the eight regions involved in the first phase, high
quality waste disposal shall be facilitated in 43 municipalities, i.e. correct waste management
shall be ensured for 1.5 million inhabitants.

III) Assessment of one’s own performance in the course of project preparation and
implementation with special emphasis on experiences acquired that may be beneficial for
the future.
In the course of project preparation it had been concluded that the project was of high risk, which
was proven correct in the course of project implementation. It was practically impossible to
envisage, in the course of project preparation, all the unfavorable situations that had to be
resolved by almost all the regions. Thanks to the exceptional level of understanding on the part
of both entity governments (project co-financing at the level of 20% of credit funds), and
especially thanks to the commitment on the part of line ministries, efforts invested by members
of the PMU and the PITs, the project was rated as successful. The large number of meetings held
both in the beginning of project implementation and throughout the period of implementation,
with the local population, with local government authorities, in order to promote the necessity of
safe waste disposal, contributed to successful finalization of the first phase.

In the course of project preparation it was concluded that BiH had lacked the legal regulations
that would regulate the issue of waste management. In the course of project implementation in
FBiH, the Waste Management Strategy was regulated and adopted, together with the Law on
Waste Management, including appropriate implementation regulations that have been, up to a


                                                 18
certain level, harmonized with the existing regulations of the European Union. Republika Srpska
also adopted the Law on Waste Management, while the Waste Management Strategy is in the
process of being adopted.

The commitment on the part of local government authorities, primarily of municipality mayors,
for the construction of regional landfills, represents the initial and extremely important
precondition for a good start of the project. The selection of locations, agreed with the local
population, may represent the most important condition for the project to succeed. Preparing the
local population through educational workshops, films, and organized visits to already
constructed regional landfills, with professional commentaries of recognized experts in the field,
may provide a lot of answers and eliminate the problems that had occurred in the course of
project implementation.

Strong and well designed public campaign at the state level is also very important for unimpeded
project implementation.

IV)   Assessment of the Bank’s performance with special emphasis on experiences
acquired
The engagement of the Bank, from the phase of project preparation, through initial phases of
project implementation, and throughout the implementation itself, was very efficient, beneficial,
and has, together with all the aforementioned factors, contributed to the successful finalization of
the project. The readiness of the Bank to get involved at any time and to assist though its
engagement in the resolution of all the problems that have occurred has also helped the
successful realization of the project.

Achievement of objectives planned under the Project that had been set by the Bank with
assistance of line ministries of both entities has confirmed that the project had been well defined.

In the course of project implementation, the planned expenditures had been redistributed
between the categories and that had resulted in the reallocation of resources, with understanding
and support of the Bank.

In addition to the engagement and support of the Bank, other investors were also involved with
grant funding in view of support and expansion of waste management financing in BiH. The
Swedish Government shall, through SIDA, implement a project in the value of EUR 10 million,
in support to SWMP I, through assisting the municipalities in those regions that have constructed
regional landfills (the region of Zenica and the region of Bijeljina). Those funds shall also be
used for the financing of a part of the public campaign in both entities with the objective of
promoting safe and high quality waste disposal.

Access to IPA funds of the EU in support to this Project is also very significant for the overall
resolution of waste management in BiH. Therefore the regional landfill in Mostar has acquired
funds in the amount of EUR 2.5 million, and the region of Banja Luka in the amount of EUR 3.0
million.

V)      Proposed arrangements for the continuation of project realization
Experiences in the implementation of the first phase assisted the definition of arrangements for
the continuation of project implementation in the second phase.

That is primarily reflected in the conditions that have to be met by the regions to be included in
the financing in the second phase of the project. The selection of the location, with support of
local government authorities and with prior consent of the local population is the first and the
most significant condition.

The minimum number of three municipalities involved with the total number of 100,000
inhabitants at least is also a very significant condition. Without an adequate quantity of waste on
the daily basis, i.e. without an appropriate and acceptable price of waste disposal, economic
sustainability of the landfill is highly questionable. The issue that is posed is what to do with
regions with sparser population density and a very large area. One of the options possible is to
co-finance the sustainability of the landfill with funds planned in the cantonal budget, but that
would require ensuring appropriate agreements in advance. The time will show how acceptable
that is in the times of economic difficulties.

The registration of the company that would implement the project, with prior establishment of
the inter-municipal council, has been proven as a good practice from the first phase.

Development of adequate studies, primarily environmental impact studies, and necessary project
documentation, shall eliminate any unpleasant surprises possible related to unfavorable
geological conditions, hydrological conditions, rational road communications, and other
elements that would first require expensive solutions, and only then put under the question mark
the economic justification of constructing a landfill, and subsequently its economic sustainability.

The implementation arrangement of the first phase of the project with one single Project
Management unit (PMU) for both entities was proven as exceptionally good, efficient and
economic, however, because of subjective reasons on the part of the representatives of Republika
Srpska, the continuation of the second phase according to the same principle was not accepted.
