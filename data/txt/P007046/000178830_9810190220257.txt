REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBIIC OF ECUADOR
FOR AN IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I suhqit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Ecuador in an amount equivalent to $5.5 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance an integrated irrigation and agricul-
tural development project in the area of Yilagro, east of the City of
Guayaquil.
PART I - THE ECONCMY
2.        The economy of Ecuador is dealt with in paragraphs 2-8 of the
President's Report dated June 1h, 1973 on a proposed loan to the Republic
of Ecbuador for a Second Development Finance Companies Project (Report No.
P-1231a-EC). These paragraphs are attached as Annex I, which also includes
a Country Data Sheet.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ECUADOR
3.        The proposed credit would be IDA's sixth operation in Ecuador.   In
addition, the Bank has made nine loans bringing the total of Bank Group funds
lent to Ecuador to $102.7 million, net of cancellations, as of May 31, 1973.
For a review of Bank Group lending to Ecuador, reference is made to paragraphs
9-13 of the above-referred President's Report on the proposed Second Development
Finance Companies Project. These paragraphs are included in Annex I. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as
of May 31, 1973,   and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN ECUADOR
4.        The agricultural sector accounts for about one-third of GDP and over
half of employment in Ecuador.   Although the expected rapid expansion of petro-
leum and manufacturing output in the next few years will diminish the relative
importance of agriculture's contribution to GDP, Ecuador is likely to remain a
primarily agrarian economy for some time, and the development of the sector
will continue to be decisive in the country's economic and social welfare.
5.        The structure of agricultural production is dictated by the country's
varied topography and climate. The coastal lowlands, which contain 45 percent
of the population, have a tropical climate ranging-from semi-arid in the south
to humid in the north. Annual crop cultivation occurs in the south, where
irrigation is available, while the north is suited to perennial crop production.
Much of the remainder is used as natural pasture. The Andean highlands, where
about half of the country's population is concentrated, comprise valleys and



- 2 -
plateaus at altitudes of 2,000-4,000 meters. Rainfall varies considerably,
but is suLfficient to support one crop annually over much of the region. Some
irrigation is available in many of the valleys, but heavy population pressure
and major problems of erosion from cultivation on hillsides have resulted in
serious productivity problems. The eastern lowlands are largely uninhabited and
unexplored. The climate is hot and humid, but poor lateritic soils limit the
potential fc,r crop cultivation.
6.        In spite of agrarian reform legislation, land distribution in
Ecuador has not changed significantly since the first such law was passed in
196L. In 1968 the top 10 percent of owners had title to about 76 percent of
the land, whereas the smallest 30 percent of the farmers owned only one
percent of the land.  The majority of farms are owner-operated - 75 percelnt of
the farms and 83 percent of the farmland were owner-occupied in 1968; most
of the balance was farmed by tenants or sharecroppers.   The situation today is
believed not to be much different from that in 1968; the Government has indi-
cated, however, that it intends to broaden its land tenure reform through new
programs in the Guayas River basin expected to benefit some 50,000 families over
the next five years.
7.        Agricultural production (including forestry and fisheries) grew at
an average annual rate of 3.6 percent (based on constant 1971 Drices) cvrel
the period 1960-70.  However, considerable fluctuations over time anid along
commodities occurred.  Thus, while during the 1960's production of cotton,
sugarcane, beans, barley, coffee and animal products grew rapidly, production
of other comodities was disappointing. In 1969 and 1970 agricultural pro-
duction increased by 5.2 and 6.2 percent largely due to good weather and
improved banana output in response to previous investment. Performance of the
sector was inadequate in 1971 with growth falling to 1.7 percent as production
of major exports stagnated.  Preliminary data for 1972 show some improvement
over 1971, but the production growth rate e.siinated at 2 to 3 percent was again
lower than the rate of population growth of about 3.4 percent.
8.        Traditionally the country has depended for its food needs on
agriculture in the central highlands. Domestic demand has outgrown, however,
the productive capacity of this region, which is constrained by the division of
the land into very small units and over-population.   This has resulted in in-
creasing food imports and has encouraged the Government to attempt to diversify
agriculture in the western lowlands, which in the past have been used mainly to
produce livestock and export crops (such as sugar and bananas) on large private
estates. This region has exceptionally favorable conditions for agricultural
production, particularly in the provinces of Guayas and El Oro. A survey of the
Guayas river basin by Canadian consultants has shown that more than 200,000 ha
could be developed for double cropping under irrigation, making it, potentially,
one of the best areas in the country for increasing production of both export and
import substitution crops. Two projects have been selected by the Government
for initial development in the basin:  Babahoyo (11,000 ha) for rice production,
financing of which is expected from the IDB; and Milagro. This shift of empha-



- 3 -
sis to the coastal area has not meant, however, the abandonment of irriga-
tion development work in the highlands, where rehabilitation or constrac-
tion of selected schemes is planned or underway. One such new scheme is
the Montufar Project (3,500 ha) receiving financial assistance from the IDB.
9.        In the past, priority was given to export agriculture, which pro-
vided the foreign exchange needed to meet the economy's import requirements.
The emergence of petroleumn as a new source of foreign exchange should now make
it possible to increase the importance of production for the domestic market in
the development strategy of the Ecuadorian Government. Because of the large
proportion of active population depending for its living on domestic oriented
agriculture, tasks such as improving productivity and increasing employment
and income opportunities in this sector would have a significant impact on the
overall living conditions in Ecuador. It would also reduce migration into
the Guayaquil and Quito areas, which is creating new demands for jobs and
urban facilities that are increasingly difficult to satisfy.
10.       The Government is aware of the urgent rural needs and, with the
prospects of additional income from oil exports and improvement of its credit
position, expects to undertake a number of measures to improve agricultural
production and the economic conditions of the rural population. Land reform
will be a key element in this regard and new programs in the Government's
Five-Year Transformation and Development Plan will aim at bringing inefficient
large holdings and uncultivated lands into production under new forms of
ownership, such as cooperatives and associations.  Productivity increase will
be a major target of these efforts, for which expanded irrigation is expected
to play an important role.
PART IV - THE PROJBCT
11.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Milagro Irrigation Project"
(No. 113a-EC, dated June 6, 1973) is being distributed separately. The main
featilres of the project and the proposed credit are summarized in Annex III.
12.       The proposed credit would be the fourth Bank Group operation in
Ecuador's agricultural sector, the first three having supported livestock
development. The initial feasibility study for the Milagro project, financed
by AID, was carried out by consultants in 1965-67. An FAO/IBRD cooperative
program mission visited the area in 1968 and recommended that additional studies
be undertaken, which the Government agreed to do. The preparation of this
additional work took longer than anticipated and, with the assistance of the
FAO/IBRD cooperative program, was finally completed in mid-1972.   The project
was appraised in October 1972, and negotiations were held in Washington from
May 4 to 9, 1973. The Borrowerts delegation was led by Mr. Cristobal Flores,
Advisor in the Ministry of Finance, and included Messrs. Jaime Bustamante,
Luis Carrera and Carlos Arana, respectively Executive Director, Chief of
Planning and Legal Counsel of the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Recursos Hidraulicos
(INERHI).



Project Description
13.       The proposed project would consist of integrated irrigation and
agricultural development of 7,000 ha in the Mlagro area, some 40 km east of
Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city. The area, adjacent to the Rio Chimbo,
whose waters it would utilize, is only partially (1,200 ha) irrigated at
present and production is mainly dependent on rainfed cropping during the
wet season. Irrigation of the entire area during the dry season would greatly
increase production and benefit some 825 farms with a population estimated
at about 6,000 persons. Except for the granting of titles to some farmers,
a process of land reform has been completed in the area. One-third of the
farmers have farms of less than 5 ha, and another one-third has farms of
5-10 ha. Only 10 farms are more than 50 ha in size. Engaged in subsistence
type agriculture, the farmers of Milagro have had little or no access to
credit or extensio71 services.  The absence of modern technology does not permit
the use of all the available land and results in extremely low productivity.
14.       The main activities under the project include:
(a)  the rehabilitation of the existing main canal and intake
structure and the construction of irrigation and drainage
systems and roads to serve a net area of 7,000 ha with
outlets to each of the 825 farms; on-farm development ,,works
consisting of land clearing, land levelling, farm ditches
and drains; and the construction of buildings (including a
warehouse and a maintenance shop) for project administration
and services;
(b) acquisition of equipment for construction, operation and
maintenance, administration and agricultural development;
(c)  the establishment within INTERI of a field-based Agricultural
Production Unit to provide farmers with production inputs,
marketing assistance, storage, transport, drying facilities
and machinery services;
(d)  the production of improved seeds and th.e carrying out of a
seed multiplication program;
(e) a feasibility study for the extension of irrigation to an
area of 10,000 to 15,000 ha west and south of the presently
proposed project area.
15.       The project also involves the granting of titles to about 20 percent
of the farmers who have not yet been issued such titles, and the realignment



- 5 -
of existing farm boundaries in order to facilitate the layout and construction
of the irrigation and drainage systems and roads. This realignment may result
in a partial loss of land by some farmers and a gain by others. In those
cases not resolved by simple land exchange between adjacent farms, the
Instituto Ecuatoriano de Reforma Agraria y Colonizacion (IERAC) would acquire
the excess land and transfer title thereon to the farmer designated by INERHI
for the purpose. These transfers would be done under the terms and conditions
provided for in the Agrarian Reform Law, and credit would be provided to the
acquiring farmers.
16.       Based on the designed cropping pattern, it is estimated that of the
net irrigation area of 7,000 ha, about. 3,600 ha would be in perennial crops
(sugarcane, 1,400 ha; bananas, 1,700 ha; cocoa, 500 ha) and about 3,400 ha
would be double-cropped with seasonal crops (rice and maize in the wet season
and groundnuts and soybeans in the dry season). Essentially, this cropping
pattern would eliminate the present low-yielding crop mixture of fruit trees
(4,200 ha) and sugarcane (2,300 ha), and would introduce oil crops and
increase the production of bananas, cereals and sugarcane.
17.       The agency responsible for constructing the project and for operating
and maintaining it thereafter would be INERHI, a quasi-autonomous agency under
the aegis of the Mlinistry of Agriculture; the Minister presides over INERHI's
five-member Board of Directors. Created in 1966 to develop Ecuador's irriga-
tion and drainage systems and ensure the rational use of water resources, INERHI
has now a staff of about 175. INERHI's strength has been on the engineering side
rather than on the agricultural development and field operations aspects of
irrigation, but studies for reorganizing and strengthening the institution are
currently underway as part of the IDB-supported Montufar project.
18.       INERHI would set up an office in the field to be managed by a Project
Director responsible for overall project execution and day-to-day operations;
the appointment of the Project Director, in consultation with the Association,
will be a condition of effectiveness. INERHI will also employ three consultants
to advise the Project Director on supervision of construction, implementation
of on-farm works, and management of the Agricultural Production Unit. INERHI
would carry out the construction of the civil works using local contractors, and
would be assisted by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Federation of Agricultural
Cooperatives (FECOPAM), the Agricultural Research Institute (INIAP), and IERAC
in carrying out the agricultural development aspects of the project. Credit to
the farmers for production purposes would be provided by the National Development
Bank (BNF). For the agricultural development phase, INERHI would set up an
Agricultural Production Unit, as part of the field office, to be headed by a
general manager. The Production Unit would be responsible for providing farmers
with a broad range of essential supporting services, including a machinery rental
service whose operational procedures would require the Association's approval
prior to purchasing the machinery. The Unit's work would be taken over at the
end of the development period by a farmers' cooperative to be organized with the
assistance of FECOPAM. A condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit would
be the execution of project implementation agreements, satisfactory to IDA,
between INERHI and the aforementioned agencies.



- 6 -
19.       Because of seasonal limitations, the project area would be divided
in three sections to permit completion of all on-farm development work in each
section during a given dry season. Production would be interrupted during
one cropping period in each section, requiring appropriate compensation to
the affected farmers. The Government has agreed to establish a fund, esti-
mated at about S/10 million, to compensate eligible farmers for the value
of the crop loss.
Financing
20.       The estimated cost of the project is $10.2 million, of which $5.3
million, or 51 percent, is in foreign exchange. The proposed credit would be
for $5.5 million, and the proceeds would be made available by the Government
to INERHI under a transfer agreement, the execution of which would be a
condition of effectiveness. In addition to covering the foreign excharnge
costs of equipment and supplies,   consultants and contingencies, the credit
would provide financing of $0.2 million for local contracting of topographic,
land-use and cadastral surveys for the feasibility study.   This small amount
of local expenditures financing would enable IDA to assist in a crucial part
of the project and in developing much needed local expertise in these types
of surveys. The balance of the project costs, equivalent to $4.7 million,
would be financed by the Government. A condition of effectiveness of the
proposed credit would be that budgetary funds of about S/1L.o0 million be
deposited in a special project account to be established by INERHI.
Procurement
21.       Because of the relatively small size of the project, and the fact
that construction work will need to be interrupted during the wet season
(December-June) each year, foreign contractors are not expected to be interested
in submitting bids for the civil works. Therefore, INERHI will construct tYLeOe
works, to be financed by the Government, using Ecuadorian contractors selected
through local bidding.   Contractors would prov de skilled and unskilled labor
and locally available material and supplies; INEaIl would provide the construc-
tion equipment ($2.1 million) financed by the proposed credit and procured in
accordance with the Bank/IDA procurement guidelines. Equipment for the agri-
cultural development phase (agricultural machinery and vehicles) and well-
drilling and testing equipment for the studies, amounting to $0.8 mdllinc in
all, would also be procured through international competitive bidding.
Miscellaneous equipment and supplies ($0.9 million financed by the credit) for
irrigation, engineering, office and laboratory, which could not be practically
grouped, would be procured through normal commercial channels on the basis of
a minimum of three quotations. Consultant services ($1.0 million) would be
obtained by INERHI through contracts with individual consultants or consulting
firms under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. For purposes of bid
comparison and contract awarding, Ecuadorian manufactured goods will be granted
a preference of 15 percent or the level of import taxes payable by a non-exempt
importer, whichever is lower. Goods manufactured in other member countries of the
Latn American Free Trade Association and the Andean Group (Cartagena Agreement)
will be granted a preference over goods manufactured in countries outside those
regional organizations equal to 15 percent or the difference in the level of
the respective import taxes actually payable by INERHI, whichever is lower.



-7 -
22.       INERHI is empowered by law to impose charges for irrigation services
uifficient to cover operation and maintenance costs and up to the full amount
of investments. Until now, however, INERHI's charges on existing projects
have not even covered the actual operation and maintenance costs. For the
Milagro project INERHI has agreed to introduce charges that would cover
operation and maintenance costs and permit it to recover, within not more
than forty years, a substantial proportion of the project investments. In
determining the initial level of charges, one important consideration has been
to assure the fatrmers' cooperation and provide sufficient incentive to maintain
their participation. Two types of charges would be imposed: (a) a charge for
"irrigation service"t to be gradually increased over a 5-year period on a per
hectare basis, commencing at S/500 per ha in the first year of receiving
irrigation and reaching S/1,500 per ha in the fifth year; and (b) a "better-
ment levy", progressive with farm size, to be paid annually from the first
year of irrigation onwards as follows: no levy in farms of up to 10 ha,
S/tOO per ha in farms of more than 10 and up to 20 ha, S/200 per ha in farms
of more than 20 and upt    50ha   and S/400 per ha in farms of more than 50 ha.
On the basis of the initial levels above, when estimated project costs and
charges are discounted at 8 percent per annum over the economic life of the
project (400 years), the charges would recover, in addition to meeting annual
costs of operation and maintenance, about 43 percent of estimated investments
costs. Expressed as a percentage of the expected incremental farm income
(before charges), farmer's average contribution would vary between 12 percent
for the smaller farms and 47 percent for the sugarcane farms. (See Section
4.01 of the draft Development Credit Agreement and Section 4.04(a) and (b)(i)
of the draft Project Agreement.)
23.       As stated earlier, the agreed charges and levies represent initial
assessments. To take account of inflation, INERHI has agreed that not later
than December 31, 1975 (scheduled date for completion of irrigation works for
the first section), and annually thereafter, the initial charges and levies
will be reviewed and adjusted for price increases in accordance with an
indexing procedure to be agreed between INERHI and the Association. Also,
since the agreed objective is to recover a substantial proportion of the invest-
ment costs, INERHI has undertaken to establish a mechanism, in agreement with
the Association, that would permit it to review and, if necessary, adjust not
later than December 31, 1978 (scheduled date for completion of all project
works), and at regular intervals thereafter, the charges and levies on the
basis of amounts actually spent and taking into account such factors as farm
size, income received and taxes paid by the farmers participating in the
project, and the need to maintain economic incentives for the farmers. (See
Section 4.04(b)(ii) and (c) of the draft Project Agreement.)
Rate of Return
24.       When costs and benefits are discounted over a 40-year period, the
economic rate of return is about 16 percent. At full project development,
eleven years after commencement of works, the net value of production would be
about $3.1 million, while the corresponding value without the project would be
about $1.0 million. Since the additional production would be for export or
import substitution, significant project benefits would accrue to the country in
the form of foreign exchange earnings. The project, furthermore, would cause a
shift from an underemployment situation to one in which the farm family labor
force would be fully used. In addition, the project would absorb annually



- 8 -
hired labor equivalent to about 1,500 man-years, cpite evenly distributed
over the year. Depending on the size of the farm, income per capita would
increase from the present range of about $50 to $320 up to $230 to $720 at
full development. No major changes in the ecology of the area are expected
as a result of the project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTIIORITY
25.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Ecuador and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and INERHI, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article
V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft resolu-
tion approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
26.       The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern of credits for
irrigation projects and contain provisions to reflect the uarious arrangements
described in Part IV above. Of special interest are the following provisions:
(a) Section 3.02 of the draft Development Credit Agreement and
Section 2.10 of the draft Project Agreement concerning the
allocation of water rights;
(b) Section 3.03 of the draft Development Credit Agreement
concerning the granting of land titles to participating
farmers;
(c) Section 3.02 of the draft Project Agreement concerning regard
for ecological and environmental aspects of the project
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
28.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

ANNEX I
Page 3 of 6
EXCERPTS FROM PRESIDENT'S REPORT DATED JUNE 1h, 1973 ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBIIC OF BCUADOR FOR A
SECOND DEVEILPMENT FINANCE COMPANIES PROJECT (REPORT NO. P-123la-EC)
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Ecuador" (No. 14a-EC), dated June 1, 1973, is being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The report observes that government revenues
and the balance of payments will benefit to a great extent from petroleum
exports which started in mid-1972. It concludes that prospects for achieving
a satisfactory growth rate over the medium-term are very good provided the
Government follows appropriate policies. Resolute action is required to
increase the absorptive capacity of the public sector and enable it to
mobilize available resources to come to grips with the country's development
needs. Annex I shows the main economic and social indicators.
3.        Although a precise estimate of the country's petroleum resources does
not yet exist, it is clear that they would provide an opportunity to achieve
both a faster rate and a more balanced pattern of economic growth.   The
anticipated high level of foreign exchange earnings from petroleum exports
strengthens Ecuador's creditworthiness for external borrowing as well as
its capacity for direct financing of the imports required to support the
development efforts. Substantial tax revenues from petroleum should
strengthen public finances, thereby enabling the Government to support a
high level of development expenditures.
4.        However, there is also the danger that the petroleum boom will
weaken fiscal discipline, encourage unnecessary imports and at the same
time put pressures on costs and prices within the country, which could
undermine IEcuador's competitive position in both agriculture and industry.
As the demand for food grows due to increasing population and income, a
tendency may develop for Ecuador to become a large-scale importer of
foodstuffs, rather than develop its agricultural potential.   Moreover,
the petroleum industry as such contributes relatively little to the
expansion of employment opportunities -- a priority objective given the
3.4 percent per annum population growth rate and the existing widespread
underemployment. Therefore, to increase employment and to overcome the basic
limitations of the economy, it is urgent to diversify the economy. Expanding
and improving activities other than oil production will permit the country
to continue self-sustained development when the expansion of the petroleum
sector eventually levels off.
5.        Furthermore, although petroleum will play a leading role during
the next several years in terms of its contribution to aggregate growth,
its direct effect on the standard of living of the population will be small
in the absence of well-designed government programs. Thus, spreading the
opportunities made possible by the petroleum-generated wealth over large
segments of the population will be one of the major challenges facing the
Ecuadorian authorities in the 1970's and appropriate development strategy
for the 1970's will have to focus on removing severe constraints to output
expansion and income redistribution.

6.        Balance of payments equilibrium at the prospective economic growth
rate of 10 percent estimated in the above-referred economic report, will re-
quire gross capital inflows totalling over $1 billion in the period 1973-77,
compared with a total of $675 million in 1967-71. Direct foreign investment,
75 percent of which is likely to be in the petroleum sector, is expected to
cover almost 60 percent of these requirements; gross public sector inflows
would provide the balance, averaging around $90 million annually. Of this,
suppliers credits are estimated to amount to some $2L million annually (only
slightly higher than the levels of the past several years), and the remainder
would come from external development financing agencies. Because of large
amortization and interest payments, the net transfer of public external re-
sources over the period would be of the order of $110 million or some $22
million annually. These levels of external financing would permit foreign
exchange reserves to rise to a more secure level equivalent to almost four
months of imports by 1977. The projected pattern of financing would also
lead to an improvement in the structure of the public external debt; on the
basis of reasonable assumptions about terms of new lending and the foreseen
large expansion in exports, the debt service ratio is expected to fall from
15 percent of exports of goods and services in 1972 to a little over 10 per-
cent in 1977. The Bank/IDA share in total debt service payments would at
the same time increase from 10 to slightly over 14 percent.
7.        Despite these favorable prospects, Ecuador will for some time
remain one of the less developed countries in Latin America. WVhile the
Government has decided to tackle some of the obstacles which have tradition-
ally hampered the development of the country - low savings capacity of the
public sector, limited government power to direct; the economy, insufficient
growth in the rural sector, and slow development of non-traditional exports -
the solution of these problems will require substantial changes in the
economic and administrative structure which can only be achieved gradually.
During the transition period, and pending a more precise determination of
the country's petroleum production prospects, Ecuador may still need to
receive part of her foreign assistance under concessional terms.
8.        In the longer term, conditions for lending to Ecuador will depend
on actual developments and perspectives in petroleum and on the ability of
the Government to meet the challenges created by them. The degree of
execution of the Five-Year Development Plan, recently approved by the Govern-
ment, will be a good indication of the Government's success in fostering
Ecuador's economic and social development.   Explicit aims of the Development
Plan are the improvement in the situation of the poorest sectors of the popu-
lation; the strengthening and expansion of the country's productive capacity;
and the creation of employment opportunities.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIO1NS IN ECUADOR
9.        Since 1954 the Bank and IDA have made nine loans and five credits to
Ecuador for a total of $102.7 million, net of cancellations. Of this amount,
about 50 percent has been for transportation, to finance the expansion of
Ecuador's road network and a new port at Guayaquil;   20 percent for agriculture,
to develop the country's livestock and fisheries sectors; 16 percent for power
generation and transmission for the City of Quito; 8 percent to support the
industrial development activities of two development finance companies, and
the remainder for education. As of April 30, 1973, a total of $25.9 million
remained to be disbursed on nine loans and credits. In addition to the proposed
loan for a second development finance companies project, a $5.5 million credit

for irrigation is to be presented shortly for your approval. IFC's total
commitments to date amount to about $4.0 million - all in industry - of which
$2.4 million is still held by the Corporation. A summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of April 30, 1973, and notes on
ongoing projects are attached as Annex II.
10.       Apart from the Bank Group,, external development financing is pro-
vided principally by USAID and IDB. External financing by sector and source
as of the end of 1972 is surmarized below:

AID loans are normally for a term of 40 years with interest at 2 to 3 percent.
IDB extends most of its loans to Ecuador from the Fund for Special Operations;
they carry 2 percent interest and terms of up to h0 years with ten years of
grace.
11.       In line with the external financing requirements discussed in
paragraph 6 and assuming a continued government effort to adopt appropriate
sector policies and achieve adequate levels of public savings, we would ex-
pect Bank Group financing to increase substantially in the period 1973-75.
Since the Government is now likely to have less severe budgetary constraints
for local financing owing to petroleum development, the main limitation to
Bank lending to Ecuador in the future may very well be the Government's
capacity to identify and prepare high priority development projects. To
help overcome this constraint, we plan to include an adequate component of
technical assistance in our loans.
12.       In spite of the expected expansion of petroleum output in the next
few years, Ecuador is likely to remain a primarily agrarian economty for some

time, and the performance of the agricultural sector will be a decisive
element in the country's economic and social development. We intend, there-
fore, to expand our lending activities in agriculture. Our operations in
the sector will aim at assisting the Government to promote crop diversifica-
tion, sustain agricultural employment, and expand production to avoid in-
creasing dependency on food imports. Recognizing the high level of rural
poverty in Ecuador, we will give priority to Droiects which directly benefit
the poorer farmers; the first example of this type of undertaking is the
Milagro Irrigation Project, to be presented for your approval shortly. We
will also be reviewing with the Government, on completion of a German-financed
feasibility report in the summer, possible assistance to the Chone-Carrizal
project in the highly populated and depressed area of Manabi Province, which
is likely to entail a broad-based program of agricultural development with
irrigation. Further support to the development of livestock production is
envisaged through a fourth operation, currently being prepared. An agricul-
tural credit program is also under consideration; however, its timing de-
pends on progress in similar credit operations being financed by AID. The
Bank will also act as Executing Agency for the UNDP in a feasibility study
to develop Ecuador's rich forestry resources in the north-western coastal
plain.
13.       With respect to industry, besides the proposed development finance
companies loan, the Bank is planning to participate in the financing of small-
scale industries to support the Government's efforts to broaden the industrial
base and create additional employment opportunities.   In the energy sector, we
are considering a fourth power project to help expand Quito's generation and
transmission system, and we have had discussions with the Instituto Ecuatoriano
de Electrificaci6n (INECEL) regarding possible assistance in carrying out
some projects included in INECEL's 1973-78 development program. In the area
of transportation, further Bank participation in the development of the
country's road network is expected to result from a highway master plan
being drawn up with Bank/IDA financing (Loan 379-ES/Credit 51-EC). Finally,
in the social sector, the Government is currently preparing for possible
Bank financing a second education project identified with assistance from
UNESCO in the fall of 1972, and we have had preliminary discussions with the
Ecuadorian authorities on possible sites and services and water supply
projects.  In proceeding with further lending, the Bank will continue to
stress the importance of strengthening the fiscal system and the institu-
tional set-up, as well as the need for undertaking an effective program to
improve standards of living and development opportunities for the poorest
segments of the population.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 379-EC/Credit No. 51-EC - Second Highway Project;    $9.0 million Loan and
$8.0 million Credit both of May 26, 1964;_
UlosLng Date:  December _31, 1l9(.3
The project, financed jointly by the Bank, IDA, the IDB and AID,
has been completed. However, a further extension of one year in the Closing
Date has been authorized to permit the use of a balance of funds under the
Credit account for financing a highway master plan and repairs and improve-
ments of vai-ious highways. This additional work is proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan No. 501-EC - First Livestock Development Project;    $4.0 million Loan of
June 19, 1967; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
Execution of this project has been satisfactory and funds were
committed ahead of schedule.   However, a few ranch investment programs and part
of the research program remained unfinished as of the end of 1972, which
required a one-year extension of the Closing Date. The Loan should be fully
disbursed within the extended period.
These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution], and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Loan No. 124-EC - Education Project; $5.1 million Credit of June 27, 1968;
Closing Date: August 31, 1974
Execution of this project had a slow start mostly due to difficul-
ties in setting up the project organization, lack of counterpart funds and
tardy recruitment of experts.  However, most of these problems were largely
overcome during 1971. In the ensuing months, the project made satisfactory
progress until earlier this year, when construction of the second and third
phase schools (the first phase schools have been almost completed) came to a
standstill due, again, to lack of local funds. In addition, there have been
procedural delays in the procurement of furniture and equipment. A supervision
mission visited Ecuador in March to assist in resolving these issues. The
local financing problem has now been temporarily resolved, but additional
funds will be needed later this year to complete school construction and for
procurement of furniture and training of teachers. We are following up this
matter with the Government in an effort to achieve a permanent solution.
Concerning procurement, the Ministry of Education was expected to award soon
contracts for the supply of furniture, and call new tenders for the supply
of equipment to permit participation of manufacturers who had failed to
comply with some minute technical requirements of Ecuador's tenders law in
the first bidding. Due to these problems, a 20-month extension of the
Closing Date to August 31, 1974 has been necessary.
Loan No. 555-EC - Fisheries Projecti $5.3 million Loan of September 5% 1968;
Closing Date:  October 31, 1974
Execution of this project has also had a slow start due mainly to
institutional problems and delays in finding prospective sub-borrowers; it
was only in 1971 that applications were received from potential borrowers. The
first four fishing vessels will now be delivered at one month intervals over
the period July-October 1973. The contract for feasibility studies for im-
proved harbor facilities is expected to be signed soon. A revised training
prograzn to adapt it to present fishing conditions in Ecuador has been agreed
by the Bank; consultants to help set up the program are expected to be
recruited shortly. Although disbursements should improve in the next few
months, when large payments for vessel construction, port studies and the
training program are anticipated, it will not be possible to complete dis-
bursements before the Closing Date, which will have to be extended by about
18-24 months.
Credit No. 173-EC - Interim Second Livestock Project;    $1.5 million Credit of
January 20, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
Execution of this project has been satisfactory and the Credit is
being disbursed on schedule.
Credit No. 222-EC - Third Livestock Development Project;    $10.0 million Credit
of December 10, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Although commitments of funds are on schedule, disbursements are behind
the rate forecast due mainly to procedural delays in the submission of withdrawal

applications.  However, some improvement in these procedures was evident
after the matter was reviewed with the Government in late 1972. Legislation
passed by the Government in April and May of this year creates a new mechanism
for channelling external financial resources and fixes at 9 percent the
ceiling on interest rates in the agricultural and small-scale industries
sectors. As the Credit Agreement establishes an interest rate of 12 percent
to be charged to the beneficiaries, the Association has informed the Govern-
ment that it cannot process withdrawal applications under the new arrangement.
The Association has proposed to the Government that a Bank mission should
visit Ecuador in late June to discuss the implications of said legislation.
Loan No. 721-EC - Development Finance Companies Project; $8.0 million Loan of
February 5, 1971; Closing Date:   June 1, 1974
Execution of this project is satisfactory, with cormitments and dis-
bursements ahead of schedule. Full disbursement is expected well before the
Closing Date.
Credit No. 286-EC - Third Power Project; $6.8 million Credit of February 15,
1972; Closing Date: June 30, 19T7
This project is about five months behind schedule due to delays in
implementing a tariff increase which deferred IDA's consideration of the
Credit, and due also to the consultants not ha*ing yet completed some of the
engineering and specifications. Because of these delays a six-month extension
of the Closing Date may be necessary. As of November 1972, overall cost
estimates were approximately 9 percent over the appraisal estimate, and may
nowbb higher following the currency realignments earlier in the year. These
cost overruns should be met from the Beneficiary's (Empresa Electrica
Quito) own internal resources and from the increased amount available from
the Japanese loaij which is expressed in yen.
