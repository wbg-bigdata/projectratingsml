IMTERI!ATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOP.1E17T
REPORT AND RECOiMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO SPAIN FOR AN
EDUCATION PROJECT
1.     I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Loan
to Spain in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $12 million.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.     The proposed Loan would be the Bank's sixth operation in Spain and
the first for education in that country. The project originated in a request
of the Government to the Bank in June 1968 to help finance the first phase
of a fundamental reform of the education system. Further economic develop-
ment in Spain requires a greater adaptability and mobility of the labor
force than can be provided by the existing educational system. Widespread
recognition of the need for change encouraged the Government to prepare a
study analyzing the deficiencies of the educational system and proposing a
thorough restructuring. These proposals have been embodied in a draft General
Education Law. To help the implementation of the reform, the Bank's financial
and technical assistance was requested.
3.     A Bank/UNESCO/FAO reconnaissam.e mission visited Spain in October-
November 1968 to review the proposed educational reform and the program for
its implementation, and to outline priority areas for investment. A project
was prepared with the help of UNESCO and submitted to the Bank in August
1969. It was appraised in October-November 1969. Negotiations took place
in March 1970 in Washington; the Spanish delegation was headed by Sr. Ricardo
Diez-Hochleitner, Undersecretary of Education and Science, and included the
Project Director and Architect and representatives of the Ministry of Finance.
4.     The following is a summary statement of Bank loans to Spain as of
April 30, 1970.
Loan No.    Year    Borrower      Purpose                Amount  Undisbursed

and others                             8.8
Total now outstanding                203.4

-,     Disbursements on the existing loans, which have been delayed in the
past, are now proceeding on schedule. Construction on the Ports Project
(Loan 429 SP) mas originally affected by delays arising from time-consuming
procedures for placing contracts, changed conditions, principally in respect
of traffic, and technical problems, all beyond the control of Spain, that
made necessary significant amendments in design. The pace of construction
and disbursement is now satisfactory. The closing date for this loan has
been postponed fram September 30, 1969 to M4arch 31, 1971, in accordance with
the revised construction schedule. In the case of the Second Railway Project
(Loan 507 SP to Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Espafioles - RENFE) progress
in physical works and management improvements are satisfactory. Utilization
of the proceeds of the Loan to finance rolling stock has been somewhat delayed;
as of April 30, $22.6 million remained undisbursed, mostly for freight cars
and locomotive spare parts; although investments in rolling stock normally
take place after all infrastructure has been installed,disbursements are to
be considered slow. However, more than $20 million has now been committed
to orders for which payments will be made before the middle of next calendar
year; this leaves only $2.6 million to be committed later this year. The
Bank's latest loan to Spain (633 SP) for Livestock Development, did not
beccme effective until January 30, 1970; because of the time required to
establish the implementing agencies and to process loans to farmers, no
withdrawals have been requested yet.
6.     IFC has made two investments in Spain totalling $4 million.  The
first was for $3.4 million in Fabrica Espanola Magnetos SA (FEMSA), an
automotive electrical equipment manufacturer, of which $2.5 million was
as a loan and the remainder in equity; as a result of sales of equity
and repayments, IFC held US $600,000 of the loan and $575,000 in equity
as of March 31, 1970. The other investment is a $0.6 million equity
participation in Banco de Desarrollo Economico Espanol, SA (BANDESCO),
a privately owned development finance company.
7.     No further proposals for Bank loans to Spain are expected to be
presented to the Executive Directors before the end of this calendar year.
Further loans for the railways, agriculture, education and ports are
under consideration.

PART III - THE PROJECT
9.     A report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project in Spain" (PE-14)
is attached (no. 1).
10.    Spain's rapid growth in the 1960's was achieved through productivity
gains and major changes in the distribution of the labor force between
sectors and between different types of activities inside sectors, accompanied
by considerable migrations of surplus rural manpower. Future economic
growth depends on continuing gains in productivity through further structural
changes in the economy. This calls for a reallocation of human resources,
which will require a high degree of mobility and adaptability of the labor
force and an increased supply of managerial talents. Spain's traditional
educational system, however, does not provide the necessary flexibility irn
the training of the labor force.
11.    The present Spanish education system suffers from qualitative rather
than quantitative shortcomings. Enrollment rates are quite high but edu-
cation is hampered by obsolete academic standards and inefficient administra-
tion.  Primary education is too exclusively oriented toward entering second-
ary education, thus resulting in high wastage rates and inadequate prepara-
tion to enter the labor market or take vocational training. Secondary
education mostly provides academic training which does not prepare
students sufficiently for those further opportunities which require studies
of a more technical character. Vocational and technical training have not
been adequately related to the general education system nor organized to



ee.ec  tDe uieods of the econamy. Higher education sufffers f-;cm lack cf
ccondination between universities and engineering schools; also, its
efficiency remains weak, with a low ratio of graduates to enrollment
partly because there are no intermediate degrees.
12.    The Government's far reaching reform program aims at improving the
quality and increasing the efficiency of the education system at all levels
by broadening and upgrading primary education, improving and re-orienting
secondary education, and rechanneling students through intermediate degrees
in higher education. Basic general education will extend over the eight
years of the compulsory school pericd, the channeling of students into
vocational training or the secondary cycle taking place at age 14 instead
of age 10. Basic general education schools will supersede in the reformed
system the present primary schools and lower secondary schools. This struc-
tural change will provide every child with the opportunity to receive a well-
balanced general education with a modern curriculum emphasizing sciences
and practical subjects before making a choice between further schooling and
vocational training. Similar principles are followed for secondary edu-
cation; a common core of studies, supplemented by a wide range of academic
and technical subjects, will prepare the student to move to the university,
to second-level vocational centers or directly into employment. Higher edu-
cation will offer twio cycles of education with an intermediate diploma after
a three-year first cycle and provide opportunities for technician training.
13.    A major element in the reform is the revision of teaching methods and
curricula and intensified teacher training.  Institutes of education, in
each university, will train secondary and higher education teachers, super-
vise primary teachers' colleges and undertake educational research under the
coordination of a National Research Center for Educational Development. They
will carry out research in all aspects of education, e.g., curriculum devel-
opment, teaching material and sociological factors affecting education,
and also test the reform principles in demonstration schools
attached to them. Plans for the improved utilization of existing facilities
and the construction of new ones have been prepared. It is also proposed
to decentralize and reorganize the central administration to increase effi-
ciency.
14.    Wiithin the framework of this reform, the Government of Spain requested
the Banik's assistance for a pilot project involving a total cost of $24 mil.ioll±
The project would primarily consist of the construction and equipment of 19
common basic schools, 20 secondary schools, 8 higher teacher training and
education research institutions and equipment for the National Research Center
for Educational Development. The project wiould also include the provision of
190 man/months of specialists for technical assistance in such fields as
curriculum development, facility planning and education management. The pioject
schools would add altogether a capacity of about 31,000 students.
They would be located so as to dovetail basic schools, secondary schools and ed-
ucation research institutions together and,therefore, more efficiently serve t2e3r



-5-
purpose as experimental and demonstration schools. They would be located
throughout the country to give pilot demonstrations of the reform principles,
with heavier concentration in Galicia in order to provide a case study in
regional implementation. The project is a pilot scheme in the sense that it
directly adds only 0.4 percent enrollment capacity at the basic level and
4 percent at the secondary level, but prepares for generalization of the
reform at a further stage.
15.    A project administrative unit would be established within the Ministry
of Education. It would supervise the implementation of the project and co-
ordinate the action of a1l parties involved in the project.
16.    About one-third of the project cost is for basic general education.
The modification of the structure of primary education is a key element in
a reform, the objective of which is to realize a better allocation of human
resources and a better productivity of the labor force. The project schools
for primary education will be designed and equipped to serve as experimental
schools closely linked with pilot secondary schools. In 1980 about 50 per-
cent of those entering the labor force will still have had only primary ed-
ucation, complemented by vocational training in a number of cases. It is
therefore essential that students be given a well-balanced general education
before they choose between further schooling and entering the labor market.
Primary teacher training is to be upgraded and its curriculum is being revised
to meet the demands of the new system.
17.    The proposed Bank loan of $12 million would finance 50 percent of the
total cost of the project. Construction will absorb 63 percent of the amount
of the loan, and equipment 25 percent, the remainder being for technical
assistance, project administration and contingencies.
18.    The foreign exchange component of the project is estimated at about
$4 million, or about 17 percent of the total cost; the proposed Bank loan
would finance the foreign exchange cost plus about $8 million of local ex-
penditures. Many high priority projects in Spain have a low foreign exchange
component because the country has achieved a relatively high degree of
development in manufacturing and construction. This is particularly the case
in agriculture and education, as was noted when the Livestock Development
Project was presented to the Executive Directors on July 15, 1969 (No. F-730)-
The Bank has a positive interest in concentrating its efforts in these sectors
since they have a great strategic importance in Spain's development progranm
and through them the Bank can act as a catalyst in achieving urgent sectoral
reforms. I consider that in these exceptional circumstances, financing part
of the local expenditures for this high priority project is fully justified.
19.    The balance of the financing for the project will come fram the bud-
getary allocation of the Ministry of Education and Science which is being
increased considerably under the education reform law. All contracts for
the supply of equipment and furniture and for construction of schools would
be awarded under international competitive bidding. Domestic manufacturers
of furniture and equipment would be accorded a margin of preference for pul-
poses of bid comparison which would be the existing rate of customs duty

aPVicPU'.e ti reOlpeiL:ng        r o: 15 p-ece,it of the c.i.f. cost, whichever
is the lowe.. The Loan Agreement contains provisions for bulk purchase of
equipment to make procurement more efficient. The project is expected to
be completed in about four years.
20.   The reform described above has been embodied by the Government in a
draft general education law which is now nearing the final stage of enact-
ment. The text of the draft law is satisfactory to the Bank and its final
enactment would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRIENTS AND AUTHORITY
21.   The draft Loan Agreement, the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and
a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
22.   The provisions of the Loan Agreement generally conform to the pattern
of loan agreements for education projects. Special features are:
(a) Section 5.01(b) provides for the establishment of the Project Unit
which will be in charge of the Project and Section 7.01(a) provides that the
Project Unit must be in operation before the Loan Agreement becomes effective.
The detailed functions of the Unit are set forth in Schedule 5 to the Loan
Agreement.
(b) Section 7.01(b) provides that the General Education Law must have
been enacted before the Loan Agreement becomes effective, and Section 6.02
makes changes in the Law or failure to implement it events of default.
PART V - THE ECONOMHY
23.   A report on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Spain"
(EMA-17a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 7, 1969.
24.   Following the 1959-60 liberalization and stabilization program, the
Spanish economy grew on average by 8 percent per year in real terms througl
1966. Investment grew rapidly, living standards improved and external re-
serves were built up, supported by a strong rise in tourism. However, Spain s
competitive position gradually deteriorated because of inflation.  A nutable
slackening in economic expansion took place in 1967-68 due to restrictive
monetary and fiscal measures taken before the 14.3 percent devaluation of
the peseta in November 1967 to reduce inflationary pressures and, after the
devaluation, to stabilize prices. The growth rate fell to about 4.3 percen'U,
but inflationary tensions diminished substantially.
25.   The economy resumed a high rate of growth in 1969.  GNP in real terms;
rose by nearly 8 percent, thus substantially exceeding the 5.5 percent annual
growth target of the Second Development Plan (1968-71). The strong reactiva-
tion of the economy under way since mid-1968 was supported by strongly   rising



-7-
eoports. S;iraulated initially by thle sluggisiness of the domestic narkct
and the devaluation of the pesetIa, commodity exports gathered momentum,
rising by about 17 percent in 1968 and 18 percent in 1969.  Subsequently,
internal demand expanded due to the ending of the wage freeze, imposed at
the end of 1967, and a substantial increase in public investment expenditure.
Together with the continuous credit expansion these measures contributed in
1969 to a rapid increase in private consumption and, surplus productive
capacity being exhausted, to a new investment boom.
26.    As a consequence of the accelerating expansion of demand, prices
again came under pressure.  However, consumer price increases, as reflected
by the official cost of living index, so far appear not to have exceeded 3.5
percent in 1969 because of the price subsidies for consumer goods introduced
after the devaluaticn and, to a certain extent, because of the continuing
increase in imports. In order to slow down the increase in internal demand
the new Government, which came into office last October, decided in Febru-
ary 1970 to postpone some Ptas. 30 billion of investment expenditure pro-
vided for in the 1970 budget. In Mlarch 1970 the Bank of Spain's discount
rate was raised from 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent. Both measures should have
a dampening effect on the increase in demand and prices. Since, however,
the daily minimum wage has been raised by as much as 17.6 percent at the
beginning of April and higher prices became effective for coal, iron and
steel, the danger remains that prices might rise again in the future.   A
more restrictive monetary policy may therefore become necessary in order
to maintain reasonable price stability.
27.    Following the new economic expansion, the balance of payments, whichl
rr      had substantially improved after the devaluation, deteriorated again.   Imports,
which are nearly twrice as large as exports, rose by 20 percent in 1969, i.e.,
a slightly higher rate than exports. Import growth accelerated further
at the end of 1969 and in early 1970, up to 30 percent above the level of
the corresponding months of the previous year. The import deposit system
introduced in December 1969 has not yet succeeded in restraining import de-
mand. Despite some improvement in net invisibles, reflecting higher receip's
from tourism and workers' remittances, the deficit on current account rose
during 1969. The net inflow of private long-term capital, mainly for direct
investment and real estate purposes, also rose significantly. However,
although new external borrowing by the public sector increased substantially
over 1968, net disbursements declined from the sharp peak in 1968 and this
more than offset the increased inflow of long-term capital to the priva-.e
sector. The net outflow of short-term capital remained at a high level
reflecting mostly the discrepancy in interest rates between Spain and other
European countries. Therefore, total net capital receipts continued to fall
and official gold and convertible currency reserves dropped in the course
of 1969 by $262 million to $833 million. At the end of February 1970 they
amounted to $873 million (excluding SDR), of which $784 million was held in
gold. These reserves were sufficient to meet about tw¢o and a half months
of imports.
28.    Under the circumstances, the most fundamental problem is the control
of the financial and monetary systems to prevent too rapid an expansion of
credit, partly thrcugh the transactions of the public sector, without applying
a "stop-go" policy. Spain has good potential for further economic growth



inth an ample sco-pe for increa3es in productivity in addition to having
substantial labor reserves.  In view of the forthcoming closer ties betwieen
Spain and the EEC, steps wvill have to be taken to make structural reforms
and improve the competitive position of key sectors, mainly in industry and
agriculture.  This may lead to greater external capital requirements than
in the past.
29.    Total external medium- and long-term public debt outstanding as of
June 30, 1969 amounted to about $1,270 million, of which about $380 million
was undisbursed. Debt service payments are moderate. They amounted to only
about 3 percent of current foreign exchange earnings in 1969. Some recent
borrowing will cause a sharp peak in debt service in 1971 equal to about 8
percent of exchange earnings.  Spain's debt servicing record is good and
Spain is regarded as creditwrorthy for substantial additional external borrowing.
PART VI - CO,PLIANCE IWITH ARTICLES OF AGREEIIENT
30.    I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the require-
ments of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMENIDATION
31.    I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
