                         Implementation Status Overview
                         At the closing of the Phase I of the Program almost all activities are completed and most KPIs were met or surpassed. Out of seven KPIs only the full development of a Financial
                         Management System (IFMIS) will have to be continued during the Second Phase of the Program. Similarly, 15 out of the 16 program indicators have been met, with only the
                         expansion of the property tax registries experiencing delays.
