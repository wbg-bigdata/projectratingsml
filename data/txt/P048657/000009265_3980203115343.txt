Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The project seeks to continue and expand the reforms initiated under the current Integrated Financial Management project (IFM-I,
Loan GU-3895) with the aim of: (i) increasing the efficiency and transparency of public sector financial management and control;
(ii) improving the delivery of public services through the deconcentration to line agencies of the primary responsibility for
management of their financial resources; (iii) improving the execution of public investment; and (iv) establishing and/or
strengthening mechanisms to reduce corruption in public sector spending. Execution of Loan GU-3895 is running well ahead of
schedule and is highly satisfactory; the proposed loan would enable the Government to extend these reforms to the rest of the non-
financial public sector, implement a new public investment subsystem linked to the IFM system, and significantly strengthen the
capacity of the Comptroller General's Office (CGO)

1.   Extending Integrated Financial Management Reforms. This component    Institution         8.4         51
would support the deepening of the reforms in various financial management sub-  Building
systems (budget, accounting, cash management, procurement) initiated under the
current project. It would also support extension of the entire reformed system to the
remainder of the non-financial sector public sector (26 entities in addition to the 6
agencies benefiting from IFM-I) through a uniform regulatoxy framework and
modem, graphics-based information technology.  Implementation of the program,
including training, in the National Institute for Municipal Development, is expected
to stimulate subsequent extension of the reforms to municipal governments.
2.  Strengthening the Comptroller General's Office (CGO). This component Policy/institution   3.7         23
would help to strengthen of the external audit function through the institutional  building
strengthening of the CGO. Major initiatives would include diagnosis of the structure
and function of the CGO, its restructuring, creation of a new human resources
management system, staff training, development of an updated audit information
technology system, and assistance in the development of substantive external audit
functions. The Government believes the above actions are especially necessary given
the CGO's enhanced role in monitoring implementation and ensuring transparency
of key aspects of the recently signed Guatemalan Peace Accords.
3.  Strengthening Public Investment Function. This component would support Policy/institution  2.0        12
reform of the public investment function and its integration into the broader  building
financial management system. It would focus on strengthening national capacity for
the identification, formulation, evaluation, execution, implementation, and ex-post
evaluation of projects, development of public investment programs, and appropriate
inter-institutional coordination and policy oversight of public investment.
4.  Modernizing Public Debt Management. This component would support a  Policy/institution    1.2          7
strengthening in the capacity of the government to contract and manage internal and  building
external debt in a better coordinated, transparent, and cost effective manner, linked
to the public sector financial management system.
5.  Project Coordination: Project coordination will be the responsibility of the  Project     1.1          7
Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) which is currently implementing IFM-I. It is   management
responsible for overseeing project development, monitoring contract implementation,
tracking disbursements, preparing semi-annual reports, and providing assistance to
the Bank's supervision missions.

3. Benefits and target population:
Effective implementation of the project would have the following major benefits: (i) qualitative improvements in the effectiveness
and efficiency of financial management throughout the central government; (ii) improved transparency in the use of public
resources; and (iii) improved quality, timeliness, and prioritization of public investment.
Target population: central government entities and population at large.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: FYs 1998-2002
Executing agencies: The project will be executed by the Executive Committee consisting of the Minister of Finance and Comptroller
General, with the participation of the National Director and International Technical Director. The Executive Committee is assisted
by a Technical Committee consisting of relevant Directors-General within the Government (i.e. for Budget, Accounting, Treasury,
etc.). The existing agreement (No. 4-95) between the Ministry of Finance and the Comptroller General's Office to coordinate in the
execution of the project will be modified once the CGO has obtained legal personality.
Project coordination: The Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) was created by Government Decree No. 217-95 in November 1995. It
reports to an Executive Cominttee consisting of the Minister of Finance and Comptroller General, with the participation of the
National Project Director and International Technical Director. The PCU, located in the Ministry of Finance, is assisted by a
Technical Committee consisting of relevant Directors-General within the MOF (i.e. for Budget, Accounting,. Treasury, etc.) plus
CGO representation. Under an agreement between the Government and UNDP, the latter is serving as a procurement agent for the
project. The Govermnent expects to extend this agreement under this project for the hiring and paying consultants and procuring
goods and services. The amendment of such agreement is a condition of effectiveness. The International and National Directors
will be responsible for the supervision of the consultants' technical outputs.
Accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements: Project records and accounts would be maintained by the PCU to
reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the operations, resources, and expenditures for each project activity. The
accounts will be consolidated annually into financial statements for the project as a whole. Supporting documentation will be made
available to Bank missions and independent auditors as required. For expenditures incurred on the basis of Statements of
Expenditures (SOEs), all records providing evidence of such expenditures will be retained by the PCU until at least one year after the
Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the Loan Account or payment out of the
Special Account is made, whichever is later. Project records and accounts, including the Special Account and SOEs, will be audited
annually in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by auditors acceptable to the Bank, with terms of
reference for auditors and reports approved by the Bank. The Bank's Financial Accounting, Reporting, and Auditing Handbook
(FARAH) published in January 1995 would be used by the auditors in accordance with the Bank's auditing guidelines. Audit reports
will be furnished to the Bank within four months after the close of the Government's fiscal year. There has been one unqualified
audit of the IFM-I project (CY96). Based on recommendations from the first annual review mission in May, 1997, the PCU has
taken a series of steps to strengthen its internal accounting system and procedures. The National Director has become a full time
financial administrator for the project and has initiated several actions covering budgeting, execution, accounting, and reporting in
order to improve the project's financial management. The design of an accounting and control system will be completed by end
1997, and the new system will be implemented shortly thereafter (on a manual basis) and transferred to a specialized project
management software system once the current review of software options is completed. Review, evaluation, and adjustment of the
new system is expected to be completed by March 31, 1998.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Monitoring of project execution will be undertaken by the PCU. The Bank will
participate in monitoring project implementation through periodic supervision missions. The PCU will provide to the Bank an
annual work plan not later than December 31 of the preceding year, starting in 1998. The PCU will provide to the Bank the 1998
work plan as a condition of effectiveness. Annual reviews of the project will be carried out not later than March 31 of each year,
starting in 1999. A mid-term review would be conducted by March 2000 to assess progress in meeting agreed targets and to identify
additional technical support as needed. Semi-annual progress reports will be presented to the Bank no later than 30 days after the
conclusion of each calendar semester, starting in 1998.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project:
Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: Report No. 14451-GU discussed May 30, 1995.
The CAS emphasizes the need to increase public savings and improve the public sector's extremely limited service delivery
capability, which is linked to a historically weak institutional capacity. Two recent ESW reports (CEM, Report No. 15352-GU, and
Public Investment Review, Report No. 16392-GU) underscore the need for an improved system of financial management to promote
faster growth. Furthermore, the PIR emphasizes the need to establish a more efficient internal and external debt management
system, as well as a sipnficantly strengthened public investment function linked to the government's financial management system.

A new CAS, which is under preparation and is scheduled for Board consideration in March, 1998, continues to assign high priority
to these activities.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Issues
Persistent under-investment in social services and basic rural infrastructure has hampered growth in Guatemala. This poor
performance reflects in part an antiquated financial management system, as well as inadequate human resources and personnel
management policies and weak tax administration. Major problems identified in a 1993 study of public sector financial management
included an overly centralized system which contributes to significant deviations of the executed budget from the budget approved
by Congress, serious shortfalls in planned investment spending, a spending pattern biased toward the capital region to the detriment
of the poorer rural areas, and serious anomalies in accountability and transparency.
Government Strategy
To correct the above deficiencies, the Government initiated a financial management reform project supported by the Integrated
Financial Management Loan (GU-3895) which became effective in April 1996. The IFM-I project is a top priority of the current
administration of President Arzu in part because strengthening financial management is essential to attainment of the economic and
social development goals and poverty alleviation objectives of the recent Peace Accords which ended 35 years of civil conflict. The
objectives of the IFM-I project are to: (i) improve the efficiency, accountability, and transparency of the financial management
functions of the public sector; and (ii) improve the delivery of public services by deconcentrating to ministries the responsibility for
managing their financial resources. The project seeks to produce modern governmental financial management sub-systems in the
key areas of budgeting, accounting, cash management, debt management, auditing, and procurement integrated through a commonly
shared reliable data base, generally applied standards and procedures for recording and reporting financial data, and establishment
of an open computer based information technology system capable of transmitting the data across the sub-systems. Upon full
implementation, accounting data vill be entered one time into the system, in accordance with government-wide standards, becoming
instantly available to all users. Utilizing the principles of regulatory centralization and operational decentralization, the project is
facilitating the transfer of financial responsibility and accountability to line ministries.
In the 20 months since IFM-I became effective the Government has made significant progress in project implementation. Nearly 80
percent of loan funds have been committed. The project team has completed basic design work in nearly all sub-components, as wetl
as assisted the Government implement a series of significant improvements in financial management practices. The project has
restructured the design of the 1998 budget (including methodology for a new budgeting-by-results program), established modernized
cash flow systems in the Treasury, selected, adapted, and begun installation of the key accounting software system, initiated training
for key public sector staff, installed preliminary financial management units in five pilot ministries plus the CGO, and helped draft
framework legislation (financial management, budget and accounting processes, external auditing, probity, and procurement).
Assessments and action plans have been recently prepared on reform in public investment and debt management processes.
Given positive early results of IFM-I, the Government wishes to deepen the reforms in various sub-systems, including debt
management, extend the system rapidly to the remaining non-financial public sector, reform the public investment function and
incorporate it into the broader system, and strengthen the external audit function through a restructuring and institutional
development effort within the CGO.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The proposed project would support the Borrower's strategy to broaden and make more comprehensive its financial management
reform program, permitting it to extend the reforms rapidly throughout the central government and to lay the basis for possible
future expansion to the municipal government level. It would also deepen reforms in debt management and external audit, and
incorporate public investment into the financial management system, as well as improve its performance as a sub-system.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The main strategic choice made by the Government was to accelerate the implementation and expansion of the IFM-I project so as to
achieve benefits as soon as possible. Expansion into public investment as well as deeper reform of the CGO reflect broadening
commitment to financial management reform, as well as decisions to take qtuck advantage of reform opportunities. The
Government decided not to await full implementation of IFM-I before initiating IFM-ll, in order not to lose momentum and support
of other entities of the non-financial public sector which are demanding a deconcentration of budget execution (also essential for the
peace process).

Lessons learned from other public sector projects and reflected in the design of this operation are the importance of: (i) ensuring
commitment and ownership of the overall reform through extensive and deep dialogue with the authorities in all aspects of project
design and implementation, plus the presentation of the project to a wide audience of senior Executive Branch and Congressional
leaders, civil society, and key staff to encourage "buy-in" and commitment; and (ii) creation of an experienced and highly-skilled
project coordination unit.
In addition, the project will benefit from lessons learned in previous technical assistance operations, including: (i) the need for
specific yet flexible action plans for each component that focus on outputs, and clearly define evaluation criteria and performance
indicators; and (ii) criteria for careful project supervision, especially with respect to procurement and supervision of consultants.
Lessons learned from other operations in Guatemala include: (i) the need for close project supervision which will be facilitated in
this case by very productive relations with the existing PCU, support from the Resident Mission, and a very strong and reinforcing
Bank presence in the supervision or preparation of related public sector management operations; and (ii) the need to assure adequate
and timely availability of counterpart flunding, which in fact should be facilitated by successful implementation of the financial
reforms.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The strength of the Government's commitment to improve financial management is shown by: (i) the rapid and satisfactory
execution of the IFM-I project, which in less than two years already has committed 80 percent of its resources; (ii) the incorporation
of additional ministries as pilots in the IFM-I project; (iii) the public importance attached to the project by the authorities as a
response to concerns about corruption and obligations under the Peace Accords; (iv) enactment of important budget reform
legislation; and (v) submission to Congress of various draft laws on financial management prepared with support of the project.
12. Value added of Bank support:
Bank support would provide critically needed and timely financing, supply high quality technical advice based on worldwide and
regional experience in financial management; convey credibility and transparency to the reform effort; and promote efficient and
effective use of the resources supporting the Government's program.

Fiscal impact:

million by the Borrower.
Project benefits. Although the impact of technical assistance activities are difficult to quantify, it is expected that this project will
result in fiscal savings both in the medium and long-run. An efficient financial management system will improve the allocation of
fiscal resources, reduce irregularities in budget execution, and enhance the transparency of budgetaiy processes. Together with a
strengthened external audit function, this wil improve the accountability of the government to the public and the prospects for
greater equity in the allocation of resources inter-regionally. The reforms to strengthen the investment function are also expected to
result in significant efficiency gains, in particular reforms in the identification, evaluation and monitoring of investment projects wiUl

provide the needed feed-back for improved investment planning and execution.. The fiscal impact from improved allocation,
reduced waste and better planning and execution may be significant. For example, the Government expects the project to contribute
to a 20 percent reduction in the discrepancy between the approved and executed investment budgets in the Ministries of Health,
Education, and Communications, as well as a 10 percent reduction in the average disbursement time profile of public investment
projects. While moving expenditures forward, these improvements should reduce the overal cost of investment by reducing the
impact of inflation on project expenditures. The Government also anticipates a 20 percent improvement in efficiency and
effectiveness indicators in those same ministries. Efficiency gains would translate into reduced administrative costs for a given level
of output.
14. Financial Assessment: Not Applicable
15. Technical Assessment:
The tasks to be undertaken under this program are demanding, but they are feasible for a country such as Guatemala, assuming
appropriate leadership and commitment. Substantial input from international consultants with experience in public debt and public
investment, as well as a specialized firm for the restructuring of the Comptroller General's Office, wil be required. At the same
time, appointment of coordinators for each area being reformed from the local counterpart team, plus selected use of national
consultants, have been built into the project design to ensure that there is sufficient local participation and transfer of knowledge.
16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies: The Executive Committee consists of the Minister of Finance and Comptroller General, with the
participation of the National Director and International Technical Director. The Executive Committee is assisted by a Technical
Committee consisting of relevant Directors-General within the MOF (i.e. for Budget, Accounting, Treasury, etc.) plus CGO
representation. The Ministry of Finance, as the rector institution for most of the sub-systems and the agency primarily responsible
for government financial operations, has taken a leading role in the project. It is one of the institutionally stronger ministries within
the Government. Top management and senior career staff are professional and motivated. The PCU is physically located within the
MOF. The successful implementation of the on-going Integrated Financial Management-I project confirms the Government's
capacity to execute the proposed project. Project execution within the Comptroller General's Office has also been satisfactory,
although implementation of the more ambitious components proposed for the second project will, inter alia, require new legislation,
as discussed in section 21 below.
b. Project management: The PCU overseeing implementation of IFM-I is performing satisfactorily. The position of National
Director is being split into two posts. The National Director for Finance and Administration will oversee and strengthen the PCU's
internal administration, including its accounting, budgeting, and procurement review systems, as well as its day-to-day working
relations with UNDP. The National Technical Director would seek to ensure appropriate interface with consultants and the
sustainability of the project. UNDP is expected to continue as the procurement agent. An amendment to the UNDP/Government
contract for this purpose would be signed prior to effectiveness.

20. Sustainability:
The combined IFM-I and II projects are expected to have a lasting impact on the financial operations of Guatemala's public sector.
By supporting a comprehensive modeniuzation and integration of the core sub-systems, the project will help the Govermment
establish more effective, efficient, and transparent expenditures and financial controls. The project's emphasis on training, the
collaboration with national universities, and the extensive reliance on government officials and staff in the design and
implementation are designed to transfer technology to the beneficiaries. Improvements in budgetary transparency and facilitation of

Guatemala Integrated Financial Management-II TAL
Detailed Project Description
Guatemalan social indicators are among the lowest in the Latin American and Caribbean region and show only slow
improvement, reflecting, among other things, persistent under-investment in social services and basic rural infiastructure.
Attempts by recent Administrations to alleviate poverty and increase social spending targeted on the poor have been
frustrated by serious institutional weaknesses within the public sector. Inadequate human resources and personnel
management policies, traditionally weak tax administration, and antiquated, overly centralized financial management
practices have hampered the delivery of basic services, the management of financial resources, and the successfuil
implementation of investment programs.
To correct these deficiencies and to help meet national commitments under recently signed Peace Accords ending 36 years of
civil war, the Government has initiated a comprehensive program of public sector reform with the goal of increasing
revenues, transferring to the private sector wherever appropriate the delivery of public services, and improving the
institutional capacity of the Central Government. A key element of the reform strategy is the rapid implementation of the
integrated financial management system presently being supported by the Integrated Financial Management Loan (3895-GU)
approved in May 1995. Major problems identified in Guatemalan public sector financial management included an overly
centralized and antiquated system which contributes to significant deviations of the executed budget from the congressional
approved budget, serious shortfalls in planned investment spending, a pattern of spending more in the capital region to the
detriment of poorer rural areas, and serious anomalies in accountability and transparency. Poor public spending misdirected
resources, undermined taxpayer compliance, and deterred foreign investment and external assistance. An improved ability to
plan, evaluate, execute, supervise, finance, audit, and account for public operations is seen as an important quid pro quo for
improved tax compliance and business investment.
The IFM-I loan, which became effective in April 1996, is one of the top priorities of the administration of President Arzu.
Strengthening financial management is seen as one of the key mechanisms for improving the prospects for meeting the
economic and social development goals and poverty alleviation objectives underlying the recent Peace Accords. The
objectives of the IFM-I project are to: (i) improve the efficiency, accountability, and transparency of the financial
management fiunctions of the public sector; and (ii) improve the delivery of public services by deconcentration to the line
ministries the responsibility for managing their financial resources. The project seeks to produce modern govermnental
financial management sub-systems in the key areas of budgeting, accounting, cash management, debt management, auditing,
and procurement integrated through a commonly shared reliable data base, generally applied standards and procedures for
recording and reporting financial data, and establishment of an open computer based information technology system capable
of communicating the data across the sub-systems. Upon full implementation there will be single entry of data in each
agency into the system, based on government-wide standards, which become instantly available to all users, and which can
be consolidated for aggregate fiscal reports.
Utilizing the principles of regulatory centralization and operational decentralization, the project will facilitate the transfer
of financial responsibility and accountability to line ministries. The Ministry of Finance and the Comptroller General's
Office will function as rector institutions to regulate and guide the overall financial operations of the government and assure
the integrity of the decentralized operations. Line ministers would assume greater operational control over their budgets,
supported by internal Financial Management Units (UDAFs). These units, once properly established with qualified and
trained staff and linked by modern information technology to the core agencies, would have responsibility for initial budget
formulation, budget implementation, accounting, procurement, and cash management. Separate Internal Audit Units
(UDAIs) reporting to ministers would also be established. The Government originally planned to pilot the refonrs in four
agencies--the Ministries of Finance, Health, and Education, and the Comptroller General's Office. Taking into account the
lessons learned, the reforms would then be expanded to other central govermnent ministries and institutions.

Technical Assistance Loan
In the 20 months since the loan has become effective the Government of Guatemala has made significant progress in project
implementation. Nearly 80 percent of project funds have been committed. The project team has completed basic design
work in nearly aU sub-components as well as assisted the Government implement a series of quick improvements in financial
management practices. Specificaly: (i) in budgeting, new budget classifications have been designed and implemented; the
1998 budget is being formulated with a new methodology of programming by results based on physical and financial
indicators; and a budget execution manual has been designed and adopted for use in executing the 1998 budget; (ii) in
accounting, new Plans of Accounts have been developed based on the new budget classifications; the current information
registry system has been improved covering both 1996 and 1997 information; accounting manuals are being formulated; and
the accounting software, revisions in procedures, and training of staff are almost completed for the introduction of the new
accounting system in 1998 in the Ministry of Finance and the remaining non-financial public sector; (iii) in cash
management, a monthly cash flow programming system has been implanted in the Treasury and is being applied in almost
all agencies designed to better reflect budget execution projections so as to facilitate timely payment and appropriate cash
management; the multiplicity of Government cash accounts has been reviewed and reduced with the aim of creating a single
government account to minimize duplication and transaction and financing costs; payment procedures have been simplified
by reducing reliance on checks (through the electronic transfer of civil servant salaries and suppliers payments directly to
banks) and by reducing the number of signatures required for check issuance; (iv) in procurement a major study has been
completed, legislation drafted, and detailed plans are being developed for a complete reorganization of the Government's
acquisitions system; (v) in financial management deconcentration, the Government expanded the number of pilot agencies
by two to include the Ministries of Communications, Public Works, and Transport, and Foreign Affairs; and Financial
Management Units (UDAFs) and the Internal Audit Units (UDAIs) supported by project consultants and training have been
established in all pilot ministries (which account for 60% of public expenditures); (vi) in information technology, an
innovative integrated software system is being developed based on a modem graphics system; the program has been
successfully tested, as is expected to go on line in early 1998 to support the new accounting system; (vii) in legal reform, the
project has helped draft important legislation relating to Government Financial Management, the Organic Law of the
Budget, the Organic Law of the Comptroller General's Office, Probity and Responsibilities, and Goods and Services
Management; and (viii) in training, over 1600 civil servants have been introduced to the new system through participation
in presentations, workshops, and seminars; by the end of 1997, 3200 staff will have been trained in depth in the new systems;
and the project has established a program with selected national universities to teach the new system to their accounting and
public administration students. IFM-I resources are projected to be fully committed by early 1998.
The proposed project would continue and expand the reforms supported by IFM-I and pursue the objectives of improved
financial efficiency and transparency embedded in the Peace Accords. Specifically, the new project would support: (i)
deepening of reforms in sub-systems, and the extension of the entire integrated financial management system to other
governmental agencies through the establishment, training, and equipping of deconcentrated financial management units;
(ii) reform of the public investment function, including the incorporation of environmental and social assessments as
appropriate into project analysis, the integration of the public investment sub-system into the govemnment's financial
management system, and the improvement of project planning, evaluation, selection, and supervision functions; (iii)
restructuring of the Office of the Comptroller General to strengthen its ability to fulfill its responsibilities as the rector
institution for govermnent audit in order to improve the transparency, effectiveness, and efficiency of public sector
operations; and (iv) deepened reform of debt management to better contract and manage in a transparent and cost effective
manner domestic and international resources for public investment. Additional resources are also needed to cover costs of
accounting software development which the Government had previously expected to receive as a government-to-government
donation.
Project Component 1- Extending integrated financial management reforms
US$8.4 million
This component, through technical assistance, information technology, and training, would support deepening of reforms in
various financial management sub-systems as well as their extension to remaining central government ministries and key
decentralized agencies. Specifically, refonns in sub-systems would include: (i) for the budget, testing and fine-tuning the
application of the new budgeting-by-results methodology; assisting in the preparation and execution of the 1999, 2000, and
2001 budgets in the Ministry of Finance; and the selective development, use, and evaluation of performance indicators
implemented in line ministries; (ii) the accounting system will be enlarged, adapted, and implemented in the rest of the
central government and decentralized entities; and accounting manuals will be developed for decentralized entities; (iii) for
cash management, the monthly cash flow program will be applied to the entire non-financial public sector; the Single

Account system will be installed and refined; the methodology for determining payment quotas for agencies will be
strengthened to better reflect budget commitment, revenue flows, and agency characteristics; the use of electronic transfers
will be expanded; and a direct commumcation system between the Treasury and the banking system to reflect revenues
collected through private banks will be developed; (iv) procurement will be strengthened through development of a
centralized and revalued inventory registry and implementation within agencies of modem goods and fixed assets
management and purchase systems; (v) in financial management deconcentration, responsibilities for transaction
procedures, authorization and budget registry process, payroll liquidation, goods management and services acquisition will
be transferred, after appropriate training and institutional capacity building, to the remaining non-financial public sector;
internal audit units will also be established; (vi) new information technology hardware as required will be installed in 26
additional agencies of the non-financial public sector; the financial accounting and budgeting software systems will be
applied to these entities and the budget for 2000 will be formulated using the new software system; and information
technology programs developed for Public Debt Management, Public Investment, and Goods and Services Management; and
(vii) a training and education effort on financial management will be undertaken with the non-financial public sector,
universities, and civil society organizations. In this regard assistance will be provided to the National Institute for Municipal
Development, the organization interfacing with municipal governments.  The project will work closely with tax
administration authorities to assure an appropriate integration of information systems.
Project Component 2 - Strengthening the Comptroller General's Office
US$3.7 million
Modem auditing involves three processes: (i) internal control through mechanisms in government agencies for authorization
of purchases, cash management, asset custody, and personnel functioning the executive branch; (ii) internal auditing through
the selective examination of accounts and supporting documentation, review of financial operations, and financial and
operation audits performed by an entity within the organization; and (iii) external auditing under the jurisdiction of the
government's supreme external audit agency. The latter involves not only selective audits of public sector operations, but
also the prescription of professional standards for internal and external audit, monitoring to assure adherence to those
standards, and supervision of the quality of audits of public entities and projects by private auditing firms contracted for that
purpose. The Comptroller General's Office (CGO), as the government's supreme external audit agency, has a major role in
assuring the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of the Govermment's financial management system. The CGO
capacity to meet its responsibilities, however, has been constrained by its outmoded organizational structure, antiquated legal
framework, and human resource limitations. The CGO has been an active participant in the implementation of IFM-I, and
major efforts have been made to strengthen the agency, including: (i) preparation of the Comptroller General's Office
Organic Law and draft internal regulations, as well as the preparation of the Probity and Responsibilities Law; (ii)
establishing external audit norms and internal audit guidelines; (iii) formulation of regulations for the hiring of private firms
to conduct government audits; (iv) creation of CGO committees to promote internal reform; (v) strengthening of auditor
training; and (vi) design of an external audit information technology system. The CGO has also helped design internal
control and audit guidelines for the pilot ministries, the presentation of training programs to internal auditors, and
development of UDAIs in the pilot ministries.
The Government wishes to continue and deepen this reform, supported by a significant restructuring of the CGO.
Institutional restructuring and capacity development, which would be coordinated with similar efforts to be undertaken in
other central government agencies, would help the CGO to play a broader role in the monitoring of the Peace Accords and in
the national effort to confront corruption. A draft Organic Law of the Comptroller General's Office, requiring a two thirds
vote of the Congress, has been presented to the Congress.
This component, through technical assistance, information technology, and training, would support the following activities:
(i) developing and strengthening the entire range of activities comprising external audit including the design and use of
national audit plans, execution of the national audit plan, communication of audit results, and auditor training; (ii)
restructuring of the CGO as result of the new functions assigned to it by the Organic Law, defining the new structure,
drafting organization manuals, and business process re-engineering; (iii) assisting the CGO to organize the change process;
(iv) developing the human resources system of the CGO and selection and training of appropriate staff; (v) developing and
implementing an internal management information system; (vi) supporting the CGO's efforts to contract out selected audit
activities to private firms; and (vii) strengthening of internal audit offices (UDAIs) in ministries.

Project Component 3 - Strengthening public investment function
USS2.0 million
The Peace Accords identilj the expansion and qualitative improvement of public investment as a top priority to promote
growth and address social development needs. As discussed in the recently published Public Investment Review (Report No.
16392-GU), public investment currently is undertaken within four institutionally separate areas-infrastructure and social
investment by sector ministries, public enterprises infrastructure investment, additional social investment by a half dozen
semi-autonomous Social Funds (e.g. Social Investment Fund, Fund for Peace, etc.), and by municipalities. Significant under
execution of public investment budgets and low capacity to disburse external funds reflect long-standing institutional
problems, including: (i) the absence of institutional mechanisms to link project design to sectoral priorities, which makes
investment decisions frequently tied to the availability of external financing rather than sectoral priorities; (ii) weak
institutional capacity to evaluate proposed investments; (iii) the absence of an effective regulatory body for investment
planning; (iv) the lack of adequate technical and financial resources at SEGEPLAN and the Ministry of Finance to devote to
investment planning, monitoring and evaluation, as well as to negotiate and disburse external funds effectively; (v)
centralization of budget execution in Finance, leading to the inability of line ministries to operationalize their sector
strategies; (vi) unreliable counterpart funds to support implementation of externally-financed projects, which makes spending
priorities effectively determined by cash availability; (vii) organizational and managerial deficiencies within line ministries;
(viu) limited coordination of investment by social funds and state enterprises, which leads to duplication, inefficiencies of
scale and disjointed investment allocations among sectors; and (ix) little or no participation of the private sector in project
execution.
This component would support the reform of public investment as a financial process to be incorporated into the broader
financial management system based on the principles of regulatory centralization and operational decentralization. Through
technical assistance, information technology, and training, it would support: (i) design and implementation of a public
investment information system including a Projects Data Base (covering potential projects as well as a registry of projects in
execution), the financial and physical status of projects, annual and multi-year budgets, and ex-post evaluation; (ii) design
and adoption of uniform methodologies for project identification, formulation, evaluation, supervision, and post-evaluation
including minimum requirements for small projects and appropriate provisions for environmental and social assessments;
(iv) formulation of project management guidelines; (iv) redefinition of the institutional framework with a clear definition of
institutional roles, strengthening of the legal and institutional framework for Cabinet-level decision-making on public
investment priorities within agreed macroeconomic parameters, as well as measures to enhance coordination among various
institutions including investment by social funds, public enterprises, and muncipalities; (v) design of guidelines for the
development of annual and multi-year public investment plans; (vi) design of an education effort to explain and promote the
new public investment program; and (vii) human resource capacity building within institutions with public investment
responsibilities.
Project Component 4 - Strengthening public debt management
US$1.2 million
Major issues in debt management in Guatemala include: (i) debt management and debt negotiation are divided among
various institutions with limited prior coordination and inadequate review of investment projects requiring external
financing; (ii) there is no information reporting system for project execution with impacts on counterpart budgeting, cash
management, and registering of debt; (iii) the debt information system is limited covering only a fraction of actual debt; (iv)
domestic debt management suffers from poor registering of creditors, a lack of evaluation of the real costs of various debt
instruments, and high servicing fees paid to the Bank of Guatemala (the Central Bank) which is a fixed percentage of debt
issued regardless of actual administrative costs; and (v) the Bank of Guatemala maintains an excessive reserve of borrowed
resources to service the debt, whose costs are passed onto the Government
Building on diagnostic work conducted under the current project, this component, through technical assistance, information
technology, and training, would support: (i) development of a new system of fees to the Bank of Guatemala, with the aim of
minimizing costs; (ii) design of a single organizational structure in the Ministry of Finance responsible for public debt
operations, which would be charged with public debt management and registry as well as participation in the negotiation of
debt; (iii) development and presentation of a training program in debt management; and (iv) designing or adapting and
implementing an information technology system to facilitate public debt management and automatic integration of relevant
information into the broader integrated management financial system.

The Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) was created by Government Decree No. 217-95 in November 1995. It reports to an
Executive Committee consisting of the Minister of Finance and Comptroller General, with the participation of the National
Director and International Technical Director. The Executive Committee is assisted by a Technical Committee consisting of
relevant Directors-General within the Government (i.e. for Budget, Accounting, Treasury, etc.). Under an agreement
between the Government and UNDP, the latter is serving as a procurement agent for the project. The International and
National Directors are responsible for the supervision of the consultants' technical outputs. UNDP is expected to continue as
the procurement agent An amendment to the UNDP/Government contract for this purpose would be signed prior to
effectiveness. The project is expectd to strengthen the institutional capacity of the PCU to help ensure the sustainability of
the project.

result in fiscal savings both in the medium and long-run. An efficient financial management system will improve the allocation of
fiscal resources, reduce irregutarities in budget execution, and enhance the transparency of budgetary processes. Together with a
strengthened external audit function, this will improve the accountability of the government to the public and the prospects for
greater equity in the allocation of resources inter-regionally. The reforms to strengthen the investment fumction are also expected to
result in significant efficiency gains, in particular the evaluation and monitoring of investment projects will provide the needed feed-
back for improved planning and execution. The fiscal impact from improved allocation, reduced waste and better planning and
execution may be significant. For example, the Government expects the project to contribute to a 20 percent reduction in the
discrepancy between the approved and executed investment budgets in the Ministries of Health, Education, and Communications, as
well as a 10 percent reduction in the average disbursement time profile of public investment projects. While moving expenditures
forward, these improvements should reduce the overall cost of investment by reducing the impact of inflation on project
expenditures. The Government also anticipates a 20 percent improvement in efficiency and effectiveness indicators in those same
ministries. Efficiency gains would translate into reduced administrative costs for a given level of output

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement of consultant services would be done according to the provisions of the "Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997) to be incorporated in the Agreement signed between Government of
Guatemala and llNDP (GUA/95/006/A/01/99 Sistema Integrado de Administracion Financiera) dated March 4, 1996, and
of goods under the provisions of "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans" (Januazy 1995, revised in January and
August 1996). For complex time-based assignments and for contracts based on a lump sum price, such contracts will be
based upon the standard form of contract for consultants' services issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as
shall have been agreed by the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract documents have been issued by the Bank, other
standard forms acceptable to the Bank shall be used. As noted in the project description, a procurement agent would be
hired to expedite project implementation. The administrative expenses would be paid with loan proceeds directly to the
procurement agent.
Table A of this section shows the project costs by procurement arrangements. International competitive bidding procedures
(ICB) shall be used for the purchase of goods including information technology equipment under the project, with contracts
for goods where practicable being grouped into bid packages of US$150,000 or more equivalent Goods estimated to cost
US$25,000 equivalent or more but less than US$150,000 equivalent per contract may be procured using National
Competitive Bidding (NCB), up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million. Goods less than US$25,000 equivalent per
contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$500,000 equivalent, may be procured by International or National
Shopping. Table A. 1 shows the selection arrangements for consultants. Requirements of prior review of other contracts for
consulting services and goods are summarized in Table B.
Disbursement
The Government through the Executive Committee will request an initial advance corresponding to estimated needs for 6
months to be deposited with the procurement agent. The procurement agent will use this advance like a special account
from which it will make payments directly to consultants and suppliers and which will be replenished quarterly on the basis
of actual expenditures. Applications for withdrawals will be prepared and submitted by the borrower to the Bank based
upon details of expenditure provided by the procurement agent or other expenditures incurred by the Borrower. If the
Borrower does not use the services of a procurement agent, it would open a special account in US dollars at the Bank of
Guatemala'with an authorized allocation of $1.1 million. Based on anticipated project expenditures in the first few months
of implementation, the initial deposit to the account would be limited to US$300,000 until aggregate amount of withdrawals
are equal to or exceed the amount of US$2,400,000. The account would be replenished monthly based on expenditures
made. Expenditures for individual contracts of goods and services, for which prior review by Bank is not required, will be
disbursed against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). For expenditures incurred on the basis of SOEs all records evidencing
such information must be retained by the PCU until at least one year after the Bank has received the audit report for the
fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the Loan Account is made. Full documentation for expenditures under
contracts requiring Bank's prior review will be submitted with the corresponding application. Disbursements, representing
mainly expenditures under short term technical assistance, will be made over a period of three years, due to the fact that the
funding will support a project already being implemented. Retroactive financing not to exceed US$1.5 million (10 percent
of the loan amount) would be applied to finance eligible expenditures made no more than a year before loan signing.
The allocation of loan proceeds is provided in Table C of this section (see Table C).
