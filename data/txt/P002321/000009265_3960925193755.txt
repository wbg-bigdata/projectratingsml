MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Performance Audit Report on Senegal
Urban Management and Rehabilitation Project
(Credit Nos. 1458-SE and SF-13)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Performance Audit Report on
Senegal - Urban Management and Rehabilitation Project (Credits 1458-SE and SF-
13)" prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department.
Senegal was the Bank's first borrower for an urban development operation
i.e. a pioneering Sites and Services Project that was successfully completed in
1981. After approval of this first project, there was a hiatus of more than ten
years in urban lending for Senegal, broken only by the project audited here.
The audited project produced much important information relative to
development of the urban sector in Senegal; strengthening and rehabilitating the
operations of existing institutions. Its timing was opportune as well, as it
provided critical inputs to the Seventh Plan of the GOS. Some of the studies,
however, had a strong theoretical bias and more dissemination is necessary to
make full use of them. The project highlights the potential role of a technical
assistance operation in sustaining sector dialogue and supporting the preparation
of future investments.
Overall, the Audit concludes that the project's achievements were
satisfactory, its institutional impact is rated as partial, and the
sustainability of project benefits as uncertain. Project's focus on Dakar alone
was, at the time, justified. The project led directly to a follow-on operation,
the Municipal and Housing Development Project (Cr. 1884-SE), approved on March
15, 1988, and now being implemented.

PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
SENEGAL
URBAN MANAGEMENT AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
(CREDITS 1458-SE AND SF-13)
PREFACE
1.          This document is a Performance Audit Report (PAR) on the Senegal:
Urban Management and Rehabilitation Project, a technical assistance (TA)
operation, which was approved by the Board of Directors on March 17, 1984, and
partly financed by two credits, 1448-SE, in the amount of SDR 2.9 million and SF-
13-SE in the amount of SDR 2.8 million. Both were fully disbursed.
2.          The PAR consists of an Evaluation Summary and a Performance Audit
Report prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department  (OED).   A Project
Completion Report (PCR) prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of the
Sahelian Department of the Africa Regional Office was previously submitted to the
Board as Report No. 10178, dated December 5, 1991.
3.          The PCR provides an adequate account of the project experience, its
successes  and its failures.   In order to give a wider and more  recent
perspective, the Audit provides additional information about the project, its
eventual outcome, and the principal lessons learned. The PAR is based on the
PCR, the President's Report, project legal documents, project files, legal files,
a transcript of the Executive Directors' discussions at Board Presentation, and
other relevant material. It also draws on field observations and on interviews
with Bank operational staff and with Senegalese Government officials in Dakar
during the audit mission of June 1992.
4.          The Audit endorses PCR findings in most respects, and expands upon
the lessons learned from the operation.  It gives particular emphasis to the
potential role of technical assistance projects in sustaining sector dialogue and
supporting the preparation of new investment operations. It also highlights the
need for the Government of Senegal, with IDA's support, to improve dissemination
of the studies financed under the project and to give greater attention to
training for urban management.
5.          Following standard OED procedures, copies of the draft PAR were sent
to the Borrower for comments on February 8, 1993, however, no co mnents were
received.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
SENEGAL
URBAN MANAGEMENT AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
(CREDITS 1458-SE AND SP-13)
I. BACKGROUND
A.    Introduction
1.01        Senegal was the first country to borrow from the Bank to help finance
a physical urban development project. The resulting operation, the Sites and
Services Project (Cr. 336-SE) was approved in June 1972.  No further lending
operations were undertaken in the urban sector until approval of the operation
reviewed here, the Urban Management. and Rehabilitation Project in April 1984.
Referred to in this report as the "TA Project," this operation ended a hiatus of
more than a decade in urban lending to the Bank's earliest urban sector client.
The TA Project was followed by the Municipal and Housing Development Project (Cr.
1884-SE), approved in 1988. Because of its role in reviving a laggard urban
sector dialogue between the GOS (the Government of Senegal) and IDA, an
assessment of the TA Project is of particular interest.
B.    Macroeconomic Context
1.02        The tertiary sector -- a largely urban phenomenon covering commerce
and other services -- dominates Senegal's economy, accounting for two-thirds of
the country's GDP when the TA Project was appraised in 1984. The performance of
other sectors, notably agriculture, but also industry, suffers adversely from
periodic droughts brought on by harsh climate conditions in the semi-arid regions
of the country.    During project  implementation  (1984-90),  Senegal's GDP
reportedly grew at an average rate of 3.4 percent per annum, despite a fall in
1989. As a result, GNP per capita, which had been US$380 in 1984, rose to US$710
by 1990.
1.03        This increase, which gave Senegal the sixth highest GNP per capita
among sub-Saharan countries, may not have led to an improvement in the living
conditions of the country's urban population however for two reasons. First, a
good part of the increase in US dollar terms can be explained by the significant
appreciation of the local currency, the CFA franc, against the dollar over the
1984-90 period.' Secondly, Senegal's GNP figures may have been over-reported.
A recent Bank economic memorandum noted that performance according to the
national accounts was not substantiated by the much lower growth reported for key
I    As member of UMOA ("Union Mon6taire Ouest-Africaine" - West African
Monetary Union) Senegal, like some eleven other countries in French-
speaking Africa, uses the CPA franc, which is tied to the French franc at
a parity of 50:1. In 1984, the rate was CFA 437 - US$1.00; by 1990, it
became CFA 256 - US$1.00, due to depreciation of the dollar against the
French franc over the period.

sectors of the economy.2  This possible inconsistency is just one example of the
severe data problems in Senegal, which the TA Project itself had to contend with
(para.  3.11).   On balance,  however, the project was implemented during a
difficult period for Senegal's economy.   Its start-up coincided with the
beginning of Senegal's macroeconomic stabilization and adjustment programs, which
were supported by the IMF and the Bank respectively.
1.04        Visible trade deficits, of on the order of some 30 percent of
exports, were a constant feature of Senegal's international payments during the
1984-90 period. Balance of payments equilibrium was achieved to a large extent
through inflows of concessional bilateral and multilateral funding, of which
Senegal has been a major recipient. The country has been an important borrower
from the Bank itself (para. 1.09). In spite of these financial inflows, export
promotion remained a key feature of Senegal's macroeconomic management. This had
traditionally been through credit to support increased production of groundnuts
and other cash crops, as well as light industrial and tourism projects, having
important implications for the capital city, Dakar.   Each of these sectors
experienced some difficulties during the 1984-90 period, especially through the
erosion of Senegal's international competitiveness due to the appreciation of the
exchange rate vis A via the country's competitors.   Notwithstanding these
obstacles, an efficiently functioning urban system, especially in Dakar, remains
a necessary condition for a sustained improvement in Senegal's macroeconomic
performance.
C.    The Urban Sector
1.05        In 1990, some 2.8 million people, or 38 percent of the Senegalese
population lived in urban areas.   Dakar overwhelmingly dominates the urban
structure of the country. With an estimated 1.5 million inhabitants in 1990, it
was home to more than half of Senegal's urban population. During the colonial
period, Dakar was the administrative center for French West Africa as a whole,
and was the focus of significant investment in urban infrastructure. Today, the
city is still one of the region's busiest commercial and transport centers. One
of the challenges for urban sector policy is to build up the comparative
advantages of Dakar, but in the context of a more modest role for the city at the
national, rather than regional, scale. This task is not made easier by the fact
that urban development in Senegal has rarely been a priority concern either for
GOS or IDA.'
1.06        With rapid population growth in excess of 4 percent per annum,
Dakar's urbanized area spread into neighboring city jurisdictions, as has
occurred in many other major world cities. Thus, the Dakar metropolitan area is
2     World Bank,  Senegal: Macroeconomic Update, Sahel Department,  Country
Operations Division, December 30, 1991, box 1.
Thus, a recent Bank study of public expenditure in Senegal did not deal
explicitly with urban investments or maintenance.   See, World Bank,
Senezal: Public Expenditure Review, Sahel Department, Country Operations
Division, December 31, 1991.

comprised of three urban communes (of Senegal's thirty-eight), namely: Dakar
itself, Pikine, and Rufisque-Bargny. Each one has its own indirectly elected
mayor.   To help coordination, a Greater Dakar Authority (CUD - "Communaut6
Urbaine de Dakar") was created in 1983 to oversee most local services, notably
solid waste collection and disposal and street maintenance. These three communes
make up the region of "Cap Vert" (the name of the peninsula vhere Dakar stands),
which is frequently mentioned in project documentation.
1.07        Other cities in Senegal are much smaller than Dakar: the next largest
Thies and Kaolack, for instance, have populations in the 100,000-150,000 range.
After these, there are only three more cities in the country with more than
50,000  inhabitants.   Difficult conditions  in semi-arid agricultural zones
especially have stimulated urban population growth through rural migration. Such
migration has put pressure on the cities, Dakar most of all, to meet the growing
needs of urban services, infrastructure, and housing.
1.08        Institutional arrangements for managing urban development in Senegal
are complex. Although local government (through urban communes and CUD in the
case of Dakar) have wide-ranging formal responsibilities, central government
(GOS) remains the key player in the sector. GOS' own intervention in the urban
sector is itself very complex, involving at least three ministries: (planning -
MOEF; housing - MUH; and infrastructure - MEQ), and many specialized agencies,
four of which should be specifically mentioned here (housing bank - BHS; urban
land development - SCAT-URBAM; real estate - SICAP; rental housing - SNHLM).
When responsibilities overlap, a multiplicity of institutions and departments
risks leading to inter-agency conflict and duplication of efforts.   The TA
Project took this complicated administrative setting as a parameter, rather than
a policy variable over which it might exercise a simplifying influence.
D.    Bank Involvement
1.09        The Bank has been an active lender in Senegal in many sectors.  Since
1981, lending has been exclusively through IDA. According to an OED study of
1989: "...on a country comparative basis, Senegal has been a preferred client of
the Bank: with just 2.5 percent of the total population of all countries in "low-
income Africa," it has received 4.7 percent of total World Bank commitments to
those countries during 1970-86."   In this review, OED was critical of the
performance of Bank lending to Senegal, citing in particular: (i) unfounded
optimism about future outcomes in structural adjustment operations; (ii) the lack
of clear vision about which areas and sectors of the economy had most potential
and were in need of support; and (iii) the Bank's failure to fully recognize the
immense constraints on development in Senegal.   Although not made with the
present project specifically in mind, as will be demonstrated below, these
observations are pertinent to some of its weaknesses: (i) unduly ambitious and
optimistic objectives (paras. 2.15-2.16); (ii) uncertain underlying direction
(para. 2.14); and (iii) insufficient attention to institutional, political, and

technical obstacles to change in the urban sector in Senegal (paras. 2.05, 2.13
and 5.02).
1.10        The Bank has been less active with respect to urban development than
in many other sectors.   To date, there have been just three urban lending
operations. The first of these, the Sites and Service Project (Cr. 336-SE), was
particularly important, however, as it was the first Bank-financed urban
operation worldwide. For an experimental project, it was a very large operation,
aiming to deliver serviced lots to 140,000 people in Camberene (Dakar) and to
another 12,000 people in Thins. The Camberene site by itself would have become
the second largest urban settlement in Senegal at that time. This fact clearly
illustrates the extent of Bank ambitions for the urban sector in the early 1970s,
when the project was being prepared. Through the Sites and Services Project in
Senegal, moreover, the Bank sought to develop a blueprint for an approach to be
replicated worldwide.5
1.11        The formal objectives of the Sites and Services operation were to:
(i) demonstrate the affordability of sites and services; (ii) mobilize private
savings for investment in shelter; and (iii) develop an institutional capacity
to execute similar programs in other cities. The project was not audited by OED,
but a detailed and critical PCR was issued in October 1983, which included the
Government's own evaluation of its successes and failures. Among the PCR's many
criticisms, those particularly relevant to the TA Project under review here were:
(i) poor cost recovery through insufficient political will on the part of the
authorities and the absence of sanctions for non-payment; (ii) inadequate
involvement of Senegalese staff in project preparation; and, related to the
previous point, (iii) Bank attention to project preparation was so close that the
project was seen as a "Bank project" for which GOS felt neither responsibility
nor attachment (Sites and Services PCR, paras. 3.16, 6.19, and 8.03). In its
final remarks in the PCR (pg. 73), GOS noted: "...there is a general feeling on
the part of the Senegalese agencies concerned that the Bank experts sought to
influence, in a way favorable to their own views, Senegalese customs and ways of
thinking.   Referred to as the 'expert mentality,' the behavior of the Bank
personnel in supervising projects financed by it is perceived as an attempt to
impose analyses, concepts and philosophy options that do not take sufficient
account of the country's own choices." Some Senegalese officials voiced similar
concerns to the Audit mission with respect to TA Project, which cast some of them
into the role of passive observers. (paras. 4.03 and 5.07).
1.12        The PCR nonetheless reported a positive side to the Sites and
Services  Project  experience.    Particularly  important was  the  successful
implementation of the smaller component in the city of Thias which, through
considerable local effort, became known as the "Senegalese" component.  Also
significant was the general acceptance of the project's basic philosophy of
trying to reach low-income beneficiaries who previously had no access to public
housing. One of the main lessons of the experience was that the operation had

been on far too large a scale to be an experiment.  In the words of the PCR
(para. 8.06): "A smaller project, backed by solid government support, would have
had a smoother implementation history. The ThiAs experience would appear to
support this conclusion."   It was nevertheless a very important learning
experience. Thirty Bank supervision missions were fielded over a period of ten
years, a coefficient of 13.5 staff weeks per million US dollars of credit amount,
approximately three times that of the TA Project. Clearly, a tremendous effort
went into what was, despite the difficulties, a worthwhile operation. Perhaps
sheer exhaustion on both sides, after such an effort helps explain the lack of
continuity of Bank-financed urban operations after the formal closure of the
Sites and Services Project in 1981. It took the project reviewed here to revive
a flagging urban sector dialogue. The TA Project also successfully led to a
follow-on operation, partly financed by IDA.
1.13        The resulting operation was the Municipal and Housing Development
Project (Cr. 1884-SE), approved by the Board in 1988. The project, expected to
be completed in June 1994, aims to strengthen local government administration.
especially in Dakar, to provide sites and services, and to stimulate private
sector housing delivery. Its municipal management component consists of: (i) a
line of credit to finance local income generating subprojects through FECL
("Fonds d'Equipement des Collectivit6s Locales" - Municipal Infrastructure Fund);
(ii) strengthening the maintenance capability of CUD ("Communaut6 Urbaine de
Dakar" - Greater Dakar Authority); (iii) continuing technical assistance to the
Traffic Bureau established under the present project and urban road investments;
and (iv) implementing a fiscal cadastre for the Dakar metropolitan area. The
project's housing component, in turn, has two parts: (i) annual delivery of 1,800
sites and services plots; and (ii) a line of credit to the Senegal Housing Bank
(BHS) to finance a program of housing construction loans. The majority of these
components were identified in connection with the TA Project.
1.14        Apart from urban projects per se, Dakar has benefitted from Bank-
supported operations in other sectors, notably air transport, investment
promotion, tourism, and fishing. Given the city's overwhelming importance in the
national economy, operations in other sectors inevitably concentrate there. It
would be illuminating to evaluate the impact of all of these operations on the
efficiency of the city as the Senegal's principal focus of economic development.
II. THE PROJECT
A.    Stand-alone Technical Assistance Proiects
2.01        Like technical assistance operations in other sectors, the project
reviewed here aimed to provide institutional support to fill gaps in particular
areas and guide sector policy makers. A recent OED review examined the results
of a number of stand-alone technical assistance operations of this kind in



6
Africa.'   The principal focus of the report vas on operations linked to
structural adjustment programs, but many of the findings, particularly in
connection with project design and objectives and the performance of foreign
consultants, are relevant to an evaluation of the present operation as well.
2.02        The OED review examined nineteen technical assistance projects in
seven countries, including Senegal, but not the TA Project itself. Only five of
the nineteen were found to have been successful. Among the reasons for the high
failure rate, according to the report, were: (i) lack of institutional
development strategy on part of borrowers and recipient institutions; (ii)
project design failed to take borrower's limited absorptive capacity into
account; (iii) unclear project objectives and vague terms of reference; (iv)
uneven performance by foreign consultants and lack of local ones; and (v)
inadequate Bank supervision for a type of operation that places heavy demands
upon supervision.   In the case of the project reviewed here, the first two
reasons -- namely (i) lack of institutional development strategy and (ii) limited
absorption capacity of borrower institutions -- constrained the success of the
operation.   Despite such difficulties, however, the OED report argued that
continuing technical assistance operations in Africa was worthwhile, as long as
some recommended improvements were made.
2.03        Among the recommendations of the OED study, those particularly
relevant to the present project were: (i) during preparation, the Bank should
give special attention to ensuring that target institutions are willing and able
to benefit from the expertise proposed; (ii) studies should be commissioned only
when they are clearly needed and should be designed and implemented in full
collaboration with the target agency; (iii) since institutional development
through technical assistance projects seeks behavioral changes in societies,
cultures and institutions, the Bank needs to evaluate behavioral issues more
thoroughly; and (iv) the Bank should continue to support a borrower's use of
local consulting firms in technical assistance projects, and encourage
partnerships between local and expatriate firms. With the benefit of hindsight,
the TA Project could have benefitted from the effective participation of target
institutions and local expertise in Senegal, whose absence was detrimental to the
success of the operation (para. 2.10). The experience of the present project
confirmed these broader conclusions and recommendations.
2.04        Technical assistance for institutional development can also be
provided as a component either of a physical development project or of a line of
credit operation. Past experience in other countries has shown that borrowers
may be willing to adopt unpopular policy or institutional measures (such as
broadening a tax base) in exchange for more popular (and usually more
substantial) financing for physical works.   Offering such a trade-off to an
institution which already has minimal institutional capacity appears to have been
the more successful approach according to an early Bank-supported study: "in
general, technical assistance has been more effective and more readily accepted
when associated with an investment and when addressed to institutions that

Development in Sub-Saharan Africa, Operations Evaluation Department, April
19, 1990.



7
already have a relatively high level of performance."'  A stand-alone technical
assistance project which has no funds for investment cannot reward the agencies
that make most institution building progress with large-scale financing of
physical components. In the case of the operation reviewed here, however, the
promise of a larger follow-on project did serve as an incentive for efficient
implementation. The TA Project's catalytic role is discussed in detail later in
this report (paras. 4.05-4.07).
B.    Issues in Proiect Preparation
2.05        As formal completion of the pioneering Sites and Services Project
approached in 1981, the Bank found itself in a dilemma. It wanted to continue
urban lending to its first urban sector borrower, but slow progress with the
Sites and Services Project (paras. 1.10-1.12) did not warrant an expansion or
continuation of that operation. Bank files of 1980/81 show that discussions for
extending sites and services operations to other cities in Senegal, as GOS
initially proposed, did not get very far. It was clear that, to prosper, urban
sector lending had to take a new direction, but which one was not clear.  In the
absence of an alternative strategy, preparation of an engineering credit was an
appropriate tactic for IDA to adopt.  It was conceived as stopgap measure to put
life back into an ailing urban lending program. At the outset, however, there
were quite unrealistic expectations about what a technical assistance credit
would be able to achieve by itself: "The objectives of the engineering credit
would be: (i) identify policy reforms which maximize public savings and improve
the efficiency of public entities and local authorities; (ii) ensure the rational
selection of investment packages in support of productive sectors with private
sector participation."' Achievement of the second goal, for example, would have
required the complete institutional and financial reform of Senegal's complex
urban sector (para. 2.10), for which the proposed operation offered no financial
support.   Nonetheless, project preparation was stimulated by the idea that
studies alone could bring about profound changes in the way urban investment was
made and urban maintenance undertaken in Senegal.
2.06        Preparation of the operation was entrusted by GOS's ad hoc project
Preparation Committee to foreign consultants.  As GOS' agent, the consultants
became IDA's principal technical interlocutor. It was not clear from project
documentation why GOS subcontracted the preparation effort in this way.
According to some Bank staff interviewed for this Audit, GOS' own institutions
had insufficient technical capacity to prepare an operation of the magnitude and
complexity foreseen at appraisal. Audit mission interlocutors in Senegal felt
that local capabilities had been underestimated. They saw the subcontracting
arrangement with the consultants as necessary, however, to increase the chances
that IDA would approve the proposal. The calibre of the consultants and their
cultural and professional affinities with IDA missions were seen by GOS officials
as guarantees of IDA approval.

2.07        There vere advantages and disadvantages in having an external agency
play a preeminent role in the preparation of an IDA-financed project. On the
plus side, it speeded preparation which took only five months.  In addition,
project preparation could take advantage of the equipment and facilities of the
consultants' installations in Europe. The arrangement had its negative side too,
however. Many GOS officials became alienated from a project proposal for which
they felt no responsibility, a point discussed in more detail below (para. 2.10).
In this respect, the Audit agrees with the PCR that the borrower's technical
agencies should be fully involved at all stages of a project (PCR para. 47).
Another problem was the lack of familiarity of some consultants with the urban
sector in Senegal, as mentioned by the PCR (para. 19).   This limited the
relevance of some proposals, notably in relation to training, for example (para.
3.23).    Finally,  project  preparation,  with  considerable  technical  and
professional resources at its disposal, risked producing a complex proposal
exceeding the absorptive capacity of the borrower's target institutions.   If
project design assumes an installed institutional capacity greater than really
exists, the project risks failure.
2.08        In a worthwhile effort to coordinate its operations with other
donors, IDA sought to mobilize co-financing for the project, but with little
success. GTZ (German technical cooperation) initially showed a lot of interest,
but preferred to pursue an urban upgrading program in a secondary city on its
own. On the other hand, Canadian Technical Assistance, CIDA, eventually agreed
to finance part of the project's Traffic Bureau component.
C.    Prolect Appraisal
2.09        The principal task of the appraisal mission was the relatively
straightforward one of assessing the consultants' preparation report, which
provided the basis for subsequent project documentation.   The timing of the
appraisal was opportune, occurring at a time when GOS needed urban sector inputs
for the Seventh Economic and Social Development Plan (1985-89). In this respect,
GOS saw the operation in part as a project preparation facility for priority
sector investments under the Plan. IDA's appraisal, however, focussed on the
technical quality of the study proposals presented.
2.10        The consultants continued to play the key role of project agent,
acting on GOS' behalf during appraisal. The consultants clearly made a strong
impression on the appraisal mission, as can be seen from this extract from the
President's Report: "the...preparation team strongly recommended improved
investment planning, policy formulation, and strengthened institutions as
preconditions to the better management of the Cap Vert Region." (PR para. 66)
A reader might well ask whether the borrower and its urban sector agencies were
in agreement with the recommendation. However technically well founded, the
consultants' recommendation would not go very far if it ran into conflict with
the policies and priorities of those institutions. In this context a more direct
policy dialogue between IDA and GOS was missing. Its absence demoralized GOS
institutions, discouraging their active support for what some government
officials saw as someone else's project, a 'consultants' project."
2.11        As  appraised,  the TA Project was  indeed a large and complex
undertaking. For that reason, close attention was correctly paid to arrangements



9
for project management, the responsibility for which was to be entrusted to an
inter-ministerial  Steering  Committee.   The consultants would  continue  as
technical advisor to this Committee, as it had been to the ad hoc Preparation
Committee. In retrospect, a simpler, more coherent design, with fewer components
might have eased the management task and, at the same time, produced results more
easily absorbed by the target institutions in Senegal.
2.12        The PCR justified the complex project organization on the basis of
the complex institutional arrangements prevailing in Senegal's urban sector (PCR
para. 12).  As mentioned earlier (para. 1.08), the project did not take on the
simplification of these arrangements as one of its principal tasks, even though
the obstacles posed by the multiplicity of institutions with overlapping
responsibilities was recognized at appraisal (PR para. 32).
2.13        The complexity of the project also exposed the inadequacy of project
documentation. As an engineering credit, no appraisal report was produced. The
President's Report, as the main technical document, was well prepared. With some
twenty tasks foreseen under the project, however, the ten pages the PR was able
to devote  to operation as a whole were insufficient.   Space was  simply
insufficient to convey the minimum technical information about the proposed
operation to the Borrower and others in the Bank. How can such a summary help
the Borrower prepare terms of reference for a complex subcomponent, such as
establishing a Traffic Bureau, for example? The PR succinctly summarized this
component costing US$1.9 million in ten lines onlyl The Audit agrees with the
PCR that a full appraisal report would have been beneficial to the operation (PCR
para. 55). Such a report would have helped clarify the project's focus at the
design stage and thereafter guided its management both locally and through IDA
supervision missions.
D.    Prolect Oblectives and Description
2.14        According  to  the  Development  Credit Agreement,  the  long-term
objective of the TA Project was to: "support improvements in the Borrower's
economic  performance by  stimulating public  savings  and by  improving  the
operational  efficiency  of  public  entities  involved  in  urban management,
maintenance and shelter."(DCA Schedule 2)   As a general statement of the
operation's aims, this reasonably expressed the intention of its authors. The
short-term objectives were: (i) to improve the allocation of scarce public
resources in urban areas through better investment planning and programming; (ii)
to formulate a housing and urban policy based on an appropriate allocation of
resources; and (iii) to maintain, with a view to ultimately improving, the
existing level of urban services in Dakar by enhancing its capacity to plan and
program rehabilitation and maintenance works and to mobilize resources.
2.15        Although these short-term goals were laudable in themselves, they
were overly ambitious, involving improvements in the urban sector that a TA
operation alone could not achieve. The project did not offer, for instance, the
means to maintain, much less improve, the level of urban services in Dakar.
Financial resources for investment and operations would be needed in order to
bring about such improvements. True, mention was made of resource mobilization,
but studies of ways to improve Dakar's financial management, studies of new
sources of funding, or even a new fiscal cadastre -- all subcomponents foreseen



10
under the project -- cannot by themselves guarantee adequate funding to maintain
the level of urban services. The implementation of fiscal strengthening requires
a concerted institution building effort and a specific management program that
the project had not intended to provide.
2.16        As formulated, the goals of the TA Project thus held out the promise
of spectacular results without, however, providing the means to achieve them.
In this respect, they were one more example of overly ambitious expectations in
Bank-financed technical assistance operations, as OED's earlier review of TA
projects in sub-Saharan Africa found (paras. 2.01-2.03). Had the real objectives
of the project been better thought through, they might have led to quantitative
performance targets (e.g., halving the unit cost of low-income housing designs;
achieving an agreed minimum level of urban investment; halving the number of road
accidents, etc.) which could have given the operation the focus it lacked. Such
targets would not only have made an assessment of project performance more
straightforward, but also have provided an important guide for supervision.
2.17        At appraisal, the project included some 20 separate tasks, grouped
into three parts: (i) Urban Investment Planning and Programming (US$1,688,000 or
25.1 percent of total costs); (ii) Housing and Urban Policy (US$1,625,000 or 24.2
percent of the total); and (iii) Municipal Policy (US$3,342,000 or 49.8 percent
of total costs). A very broad range of subcomponents was proposed, as can be
seen from the project description reproduced here.   To help assess their
performance, the Audit report has added the estimated cost of each subcomponent
as well as its category (man. - management of the TA Project itself; study; or
inst. - institution building):'
Part A: Urban Investment Planning and Programming
(i)         Steering Committee (US$561,000):
(a)   preparatory and start-up activities including,
inter alia, the selection of specialists and
consultants (man.); and
(b)   technical monitoring during the execution of the
Project (man.).
(ii)        Seventh Plan: Preparation of the urban sector investment
program of the Seventh Plan, including inter alia:
(a)   the carrying out of a methodological study to
define guidelines for appraisal and selection of
urban rehabilitation projects for inclusion in
the Seventh Plan and to monitor physical and

costs and prices of subsidized housing) and
review  of  existing  mechanisms  of  resource
mobilization and of low-cost housing finance; and
(b)   on  the  basis  of  such  analysis  and  review,
formulation of recommendations aimed at improving
resource mobilization and use and at increasing

collection by parapublic housing companies and the
central government.
(iii)       Rehabilitation of OHLM (US$114,000 - inst.): preparation
of a rehabilitation program for OHLM, and thereafter
preparation of a contrat plan consisting of diagnostic
studies, detailed recommendations, and a timetable for
implementing the recommended actions, all aimed at
improving financial and managerial performance and at
redirecting OHLR's activities to lower-standard, lower-
cost housing operations affordable by the bottom two-
thirds of the urban population.
(iv)        Land Development Agencv (US$336,000 - inst.): carrying
out a feasibility study for the establishment of a
parapublic enterprise for the servicing of urban land
with infrastructure and for community facilities and for
residential, commercial, and industrial use, and
focussing, inter alia, on standards that would make
serviced land affordable to the bottom two thirds of the



12
urban population, on financial arrangements, and on the
obligations of other parapublic and private entities
engaged in infrastructure service and delivery.
(v)         Design Alternatives for Land Develoyment: carrying out

two sites in Dakar; and
(b)   detailed   design   and   engineering   of   an
infrastructure rehabilitation plan for part of
central Pikine, taking into account the detailed
urban development plan referred to in Part A.(ii)
(b) above.

delivery  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure
services (study);
(b)   identification and implementation of actions to
improve financial management of Dakar (study);

Dakar (study); and
(d)   analysis of the role and operating procedures of
the    Borrower's    Fonds    d'Equipement    des
Collectivites   Locales   and   formulation   of

instrument for municipal works projects (study).



13
(ii)        Maintenance (US$507,000):
(a)   identification of rehabilitation and maintenance
works and equipment required to rehabilitate and
maintain  existing  levels  of  infrastructure
services in Dakar, and the formulation of
recommendations for alternative solutions for

maintenance   and   rehabilitation  of  Dakar's
infrastructure services equipment, including the
purchase of equipment and spare parts (inst.);
and
(c)   establishment of a cost accounting and annual
budgeting system for Dakar's Technical Department
(inst.).
(iii)       Traffic Management (US$1,873, 000- inst.) establishment
of a traffic bureau within the Directorate of Studies
and Programming of the Ministry of Equipment and
carrying out by such traffic bureau of:
(a)   preparation of a priority action program for
traffic management in Dakar designed to improve
circulation for pedestrians, buses and municipal
service vehicles and to improve access to and
conditions in central Pikine; and
(b)   implementation and monitoring of the first year
of said traffic management program, including the
surfacing of footpaths, paving of roads to simple
design standards to allow bus access, traffic
control measures, junction improvements and
provision of traffic signals.
(iv)        Training Program (US$51,000 - training):
(a)   identification of technical and administrative
staffing requirements for Dakar and establishment
of a priority training program; and
(b)   training of selected  staff  of Dakar  through
short-term traineeships, workshops, and seminars.
2.18        Despite the broad range of studies and actions proposed, important
aspects of the urban sector were not covered by the project. Conspicuous by
their absence, for example, are references to basic sanitation and solid waste
collection and disposal, which are critical issues affecting Dakar. Furthermore,
the training component was surprisingly small, given the frequent references made
to the shortages of skilled personnel in urban sector institutions in Senegal.



14
The project could not, of course, be expected to cover everything, but it is not
clear what criteria were used to select the components that were included. In
practice, it seemed that a combination of GOS priorities, the consultants'
skills, and Bank staff interests determined the final composition of the project.
2.19         Four kinds of activities were foreseen under the TA Project. First,
studies were to be undertaken into various aspects of the urban sector (urban
planning, housing finance, pilot designs, and municipal organization). Secondly,
institution building actions included improved management of state-owned
properties, rehabilitation of OHLM, and creation of a land development agency and
a traffic bureau.  Thirdly, there was a very small trainin-t component.  The final
activity was management of the project itself. The data in Table I gives a rough
breakdown of the estimated costs of these activities. Approximately equal shares
at appraisal were allocated to studies and institutional building. The small
amount for training has already been mentioned. Project management by itself was
expected to account for 8.4 percent of project costs, a reasonable overhead for
a complex operation. A simpler design would have considerably reduced this cost
however. Unfortunately, due to inadequate cost accounting during implementation
(details paras. 3.07-3.09), it was not possible to reconstruct Table 1 with the
actual costs incurred by these activities.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS
A.    Scheduling
3.01        The project was scheduled for completion by December 1987. Start-up
delays and slower progress than foreseen led to two extensions of the Credit's
closing date. The operation was completed in June 1990, two-and-a-half years
behind schedule. The PCR (paras. 18-19) highlighted some of the reasons for the
delays, which included: (i) financial and technical weakness of the institutions
targeted for technical assistance; (ii) shortage of counterpart funds; and (iii)
inadequate logistical support.  Other problems mentioned by the PCR, notably the
poor remuneration of Senegalese staff assigned to the project discouraged their
more  active participation.10  In addition,  some  foreign  consultants were
unfamiliar with the Senegalese context. Interlocutors of the Audit mission in
Senegal confirmed the existence of these problems, adding that the mobilization
of consultant teams took much longer than expected.   In spite of the many
difficulties faced during implementation, all IDA supervision missions except the
first one (July 1985) reported project performance as being "problem free."
3.02        In contrast to delays in implementing the TA Project itself, IDA was
prompt to initiate discussions about a possible follow-on operation. Terms of
reference for the second supervision mission, which took place in Paris some
twelve months after Credit effectiveness, included instructions for the mission
to begin to identify a second project. Despite the tardiness in the execution
of its own components, the TA Project moved efficiently towards fulfilling its
implicit aim of reviving the urban sector dialogue in Senegal.
B.    Documents Produced
3.03        The physical output of reports produced through the project was
substantial.  Today, some eighty documents constitute a veritable library of
documentation on the urban sector in Senegal, and about Dakar in particular. The
Audit mission was impressed by the well-organized documentation center of the
Project Management Unit in MEFP in Dakar, which appeared to have a complete set
of the project's reports. With the assistance of the librarian, the mission was
able to locate selected reports from among the operation's output. MEFP's set,
however, was the only complete collection in Senegal. Only a few of the project
reports were available in the Bank's Resident Mission, for example.
3.04        During discussions with GOS and Dakar sectoral agencies targeted for
institution building, the Audit mission inquired about present management's
knowledge of the project and the relevant studies produced. Disturbingly, only
'    The  sharp  differences  of remuneration between local and expatriate
professionals created a difficult working environment for effective
collaboration between the two. According to the President's Report, for
example, the cost of Senegalese specialists was estimated at US$ 1,000 per
staff-month, while that of foreign resident specialists was estimated at
US$ 11,000 (PR para. 58).

one interlocutor was familiar with the reports pertaining to his sector,11
Whether this was the result of inadequate dissemination of project findings by
MEFP, resistance on the part of sectoral agencies to use them, or reticence on
the part of the Audit mission's interlocutors, it was clear that the results of
project were not well known among Senegal's urban sector institutions. The Audit
expected to find a much greater general knowledge of the reports in view of the
large scale and broad scope of the output produced.
3.05        Even though the documentation is known to exist, the US$8.3 million
invested in the project was intended to produce more than just a library.  The
studies were to be used as management instruments for institution building in
Senegal's urban sector.   For this purpose,  the Audit recommends  a wider
dissemination of the reports produced. This could begin with preparation and
publication of an annotated bibliography, containing report abstracts.   In
addition, the Project Unit of HEFP could undertake to reproduce key documents and
distribute them to interested sectoral agencies. Actions such as these could
help ensure a more adequate return on the significant investment made in the
project.
C.    Proiect Manazement
3.06        A project to undertake some twenty different tasks affecting at least
seventeen different GOS and municipal agencies inevitably presented a daunting
challenge to those responsible for its management. As already mentioned, project
design gave due attention to this question, foreseeing management by a Steering
Committee, advised by foreign consultants (para. 2.11). However, according to
the GOS PCR, technical assistance to provide management advice was not effective
(PCR para. 65). The Committee, made up representatives of five ministries, three
GOS sectoral agencies, and CUD, met only twice. With no more meetings after
1986, project management and coordination began to disintegrate, making the
already difficult task of giving cohesion to the project almost impossible. As
GOS' PCR (para. 70) pointed out: "...the components were simultaneously
implemented by the various agencies without any contacts or intercommunication
among the various parties."   Project coordination failed,  but,  given the
multitude of agencies involved, the task faced by project management was nearly
impossible to fulfil. Had project goals been more operational and project design
less complex, a few key performance indicators could have been agreed and
monitored by those responsible for project management during implementation.
D.    Cost Accounting
3.07        According to the PCR (para. 29), final project costs were US$8.3
million, significantly higher than the US$6.7 million estimated at appraisal.
Depreciation of the US dollar vis & vis the project's unit of account (SDR -
Special Drawing Rights) led to the surplus funds. They were used, with IDA's
agreement, to finance additional components and cover the rising costs of some
This was the Local Government Department of the Ministry of the Interior
(DCL/MOI) which was not even targeted as a project institution at
appraisal.



17
existing ones. As per the project legal agreements, the Borrower maintained
separate accounts for these expenditures.   On the basis of these accounts,
however, it was not possible for the Audit mission to identify the precise costs
incurred for each component. Most consulting firms hired under the project had
worked on more than one component. Accounting had been on a cash basis with
respect to payments and reimbursements to those firms, independently of the
specific task involved.
3.08        A large investment in studies and technical assistance was made under
the project, but, due to poor accounting, it is not possible to ascertain
precisely how much any particular study cost, and, thus, how its actual cost
compared with that foreseen at appraisal. This raises two important issues for
the management of similar operations in the future. First and most serious,
there is the obvious risk that project management can lose control of project
costs if these are not properly accounted for. Secondly, from an institution
building perspective, neither the Borrower nor IDA learned much about how much
particular studies cost in practice. Knowledge of component costs is essential
if IDA wishes to repeat similar activities in other countries, for example, or
if the Borrower wishes to update a component already completed. Unless accounts
are properly kept and regularly audited in accordance with legal agreements, IDA
should advise the Borrower early on of the possible remedies under those
agreements, which may include suspension of disbursements.
3.09        The PCR itself (para. 44) mentioned problems in connection with the
project accounting.   Only as Credit closing approached, however, did Bank
supervision missions express concern to GOS about the poor state of project
accounts.'2 Towards the end, missions worked with project staff in Dakar to try
to clarify its financial position, but IDA was forced to conclude that an up-to-
date vision of the project accounts was no longer obtainable.'  This was a
telling remark about administration of an operation supposedly aimed at helping
agencies in the urban sector improve their management and finances (including
their own cost accounting).
12    A fax sent by IDA to the Project Unit in Dakar in January 1990 pointed out
that the financial audit for the 1989/90 accounts did not comment upon the
reliability of the accounts, nor did it certify the financial operations
made.

E.    Results of SDecific Components
1. Urban Investment Planning and Programming"
3.10        According to the PCR (Annex 1, para. 3), this was one of the most
successful project components in terms of the results achieved: "...the
innovative light thrown on the notion of the urban sector, the hinterland and the
interactions with its subparts was one of the major achievements of this
component and helped in the redistribution of the scope of three-year public
investment planning." Certainly, much work was done and several large reports
were produced. In the reports reviewed by the Audit mission, however, much of
the content focussed on urban planning theory. In contrast, little attention was
given to the specific tasks of urban sector institutions in preparation of the
country's Seventh Plan under way.   The theoretical bias of these studies is
understandable, since the project description called for "a methodological study
to define guidelines" for appraisal and selection of projects.
3.11        A major study on the coordination of urban investments focussed on
the growing importance of the public sector in urban development, and reconmended
that local communes be given a larger role in urban planning and investment. A
major weakness of the study was that it did not survey previous work undertaken.
The authors justifiably complained of the lack of sufficient data on the urban
sector in Senegal. The lesson of this experience is that future TA operations
should help consolidate data bases and build permanent institutional capacity for
data collection.
3.12        Studies on investment programming and public sector intervention in
the Senegalese urban sector were also completed under this component.   The
investment programming study produced a theoretical model for the allocation of
investments that, according to Audit mission's interlocutors in Senegal, was not
put into practice. The study of public sector intervention produced the largest
report of the entire project. Although it provided a sound analysis of past
trends, this report did not offer a perspective of the possible future role of
the public sector, which might have provided parameters for future privatization
efforts, for example. Regarding up-dates of the Dakar/Cap Vert urban development
plan, foreseen under the project, the results obtained were disappointing. Weak
economic analysis and poor data presentation may help to explain why the Audit
mission could find little evidence of the study findings having been incorporated
into CUD's work.
For this component, the Audit's attention focussed on the following: (i)
La Planification du Secteur Urbain: Etude Retrospective et ConceDts d'un
Svsteme de Comrtabilization, Rapport Rhsume, May 1986; (ii) Programation

May 1986; and (iv) Plan Directeur d'Urbanisme de Dakar 2010, Rapport
justificatif, July 1986.

2. Housing and Urban Policy"5
3.13        The project produced important studies on housing finance and
construction costs and prices in the housing subsector. Particularly with regard
to pricing, one report which presented data on past trends was used to develop
an elaborate computerized system to determine "reference prices' for use in
public sector contracts. The PCR (Annex 1 para. 15) reported that these prices
were not put in practice however. The study nevertheless provided a valuable
reference work for planners and managers in the sector. This is one example of
a worthwhile document whose wider dissemination would be useful for urban sector
management in Senegal and elsewhere (para. 3.05).
3.14        A study concerned with the rehabilitation of OHLM (GOS' low-cost
rental housing agency) made detailed recommendations about the future
organization and operation of the agency.   As it depended on unsustainable
subsidies, OHLM had been in long-term decline. Implementation of the early Sites
and Services Project in Senegal, for all its problems, had demonstrated a more
affordable approach to low-cost housing (paras. 1.10-1.12). Partly as a result
of the TA Project study, OHLM was re-constituted in 1989 as a state-owned
company, SNHLM ("Soci6t6 Nationale d'Habitations & Loyers Mod6r6s" - National
Low-cost Rental Housing Company). However, the PCR (Annex 1 para. 20) noted no
significant operational improvements arising from this change.
3.15        The Audit also searched for evidence of the impact of project studies
concerning  housing  finance  and  resource  mobilization  on  present  sector
operations, but found little. In the case of the Senegal Housing Bank (BHS), for
example, senior management informed the Audit mission that it was not familiar
with the content of these studies.
3.16        The project commissioned a small study into the management of state-
owned properties.  Although one of the least costly, it was among the most
practical of the studies financed under the TA Project.  It recommended ways of
coordinating GOS information about its real estate assets, through a computerized
data bank. It also recommended ways of administering state-owned properties, so

that rental income would be updated to reflect changes in market values, thus
bringing significant savings to GOS.
3.17        A feasibility study was also carried out under the project into the
establishment of an urban land development agency.   This was an important
institution building step to establish a successor to DPA ("Direction des
Parcelles Assainiesn), responsible for implementation of the earlier Sites and
Services Project (paras. 1.10-1.12).   As a result of the study, SCAT-URBAM
("Soci6te Centrale d'Am6nagement des Terrains Urbains") was established in 1988
as a state-owned company responsible for developing serviced lots in urban areas.
SCAT-URBAM is fully operational today, having delivered 1,400 serviced lots in
1991.   The agency's management was one of the few in Senegal that clearly
recognized the importance of the TA Project, not only in helping to set up the
new institution itself, but also in providing guidelines in helping to run it.
Unfortunately, soon after its establishment, the agency had to raise plot and
service standards to meet official norms. This resulted in increased costs and
meant that the lots are no longer affordable by the lowest-income groups as
originally hoped.
3. Municipal Policy"
3.18        This was by far the largest project component,  accounting for
approximately half of project costs at appraisal.   The establishment of the
Traffic Bureau was a important outcome of this component. Transportation studies
(themselves accounting for half of the component's cost) were generally well
prepared, and included surveys of work previously undertaken.  They provided
useful inputs for the work of the Traffic Bureau itself, which was slow to get
off the ground. A supervision mission fielded shortly after its creation in 1989
noted that practically none of the Bureau's equipment (from traffic counters to
xerox machines) was in operating order. The Bureau is more consolidated today,
however, to the point of having provided technical assistance to neighboring
countries. Its management recognized that the Bureau's existence and present
operations today owed a lot to the TA Project.
3.19        A study was contracted to make recommendations about the suitability
of FECL ("Fonds d'Equipement des Collectivit6s Locales" - Municipal
Infrastructure Fund) as a instrument for financing municipal works projects.
Audit mission efforts to identify the impact of the study on FECL and on policy
makers' opinion of FECL were in vain. Management of BHS, which is responsible
for administering FECL, was unable to specify changes to the status of FECL
arising from the project.
Studies reviewed in connection with this component included: (i) Plan
d'Action Prioritaire nour la Realisation du Plan de Circulation de Dakar,
May 1986; (ii) Proeramme de Formation Prioritaire du Personnel des
Services Techniques de la Communaut6 Urbaine de Dakar, 1987; and (iii)
Plan de Formation your lee Personnels des Communes de Dakar. Pikine.

March 1988.

3.20        From discussions with representatives of DCL and CUD, on the other
hand, the Audit mission learned that project studies on municipal maintenance had
been useful in helping their operations. Both interlocutors admitted, however,
that most improvements to maintenance methods had occurred through the follow-on
Municipal and Housing Development Project, which had financed the acquisition of
equipment.
3.21        Officials of the Local Government Department of the Ministry of the
Interior (DCL-MOI) confirmed that the contents of TA studies on municipal finance
were well known to them. These studies helped reveal the chaotic situation of
municipal finances in Senegal and the need for urgent reforms.
3.22        The  actual  performance  of CUD's  finances  has,  however,  been
disappointing. Although the PCR reported total revenue doubling between 1984 and
1987 to reach CFAF 8.0 billion (US$26.6 million) in the latter year, the Audit
mission was informed that revenues are much lower today. The 1992 budget, for
example (exceptionally for the eighteen month period June 1991 to December 1992),
foresaw total revenues of CFAF 8.9 billion (US$31.4 million), equivalent to an
annual income of only CFAF 5.9 billion (US$21.0 million). Many factors other
than the TA Project are responsible for the poor performance.   This  is
nevertheless a disappointing outcome for an operation aimed at improving Dakar's
ability to mobilize resources for urban investment and maintenance.
3.23        The project's very small training activity was also included under
the Municipal Policy component. This subcomponent accounted for less than one
per cent of total project costs at appraisal. Not only was the level of effort
disappointing, but so too was its quality.   In spite of the widely quoted
shortage of skilled personnel in Senegal's urban sector, the project provided no
survey of municipal and other training needs. The principal product of the TA
Project was merely a series of standardized course curricula for accountants,
surveyors etc., similar to those used in many other countries, and probably
elsewhere in Senegal as well. The Audit considers that GOS could readily have
acquired this kind of material locally, at practically no cost. The Audit agrees
with the PCR (Annex 1 para. 80) that: "significant efforts still have to be made
to ensure that training is not reduced to the consumption of off-the-shelf
products proposed by external agencies, but rather is tailored to suit the needs
of local communities." The scarcity of skilled personnel locally was cited as
one of the reasons why the preparation of the project had to be contracted out
to an overseas agency. In such circumstances, the absence of a training program
based on an analysis of the specific training needs in the country's urban sector
represented a serious flaw in project design.
F.    Sustainabilitv
3.24        In a technical assistance operation such as this one, sustainability
depends on a number of factors. To begin with, it depends on the availability
of study results to target institutions and these agencies' willingness to
implement acceptable recommendations.   The study results generated under the
present operation are available in the documentation center of the Project Unit
in MEFP, but as a library.  It is clear, however, that for a passive set of
documents to become a data bank of management tools and information, far greater
dissemination has to take place. The actual willingness and ability of urban



22
sector institutions in Senegal to incorporate the project findings, as discussed
earlier in this report, varied.  Some absorbed the project experience, while
others reported that it had no impact on their operations and planning. Finally,
sustainability depends on the permanence of the institutions themselves. Many
conditions, therefore, have to be fulfilled before a definitive conclusion can
be reached about the sustainability of the results obtained.
IV. OTHER POINTS OF INTEREST
A.    Delegation of Proiect Preparation and ImDlementation Responsibilities
4.01        Preparation of the project reviewed in this report vas entrusted to
foreign  consultants.    Project  design  and  content was  derived  from  the
consultants' preparation report. The project also foresaw a leading role for the
same consultants in advising the Steering Committee responsible for project
management. GOS had effectively delegated technical authority to the agency.
4.02        As mentioned earlier, such an arrangement presented a number of
short-term benefits for both GOS and IDA. The advantages for GOS included: (i)
relieving its limited staff of heavy project preparation duties; (ii) ready
access to high calibre professional skills and equipment; and (iii) a project
proposal likely to be approved by IDA.   For IDA, there were the following
advantages: (i) rapid project preparation; (ii) an easy dialogue with technical
staff having a similar professional background to mission staff; and (iii) much
better facilities, equipment, and installations to support missions than those
available in Dakar.
4.03        Against these benefits, however, must be weighed the drawbacks of
excessive reliance on external agents, a number of which have already been
mentioned. Perhaps the most important of these is the risk of alienating the
Borrower and its executing agencies from an operation which they no longer see
as their own. For some it became a "consultants' project" (para. 2.10). The PCR
itself (para. 46) raised doubts about the extent to which executing agencies were
in agreement with the design and the aims of the project. As pointed out earlier
in this report (para. 2.03), other Bank studies have highlighted the need for
agencies targeted for institution building measures to be fully involved in
project preparation.
4.04        An external agent can give excellent technical advice to a government
agency, but cannot make policy commitments on its behalf. To convince an agency
to adopt reforms and make institutional changes, experience in other countries
has shown that its full participation in project preparation is essential. To
succeed, Bank sector policy dialogue has to be directly with policy-makers, not
their agents.
B.    TA Operations to Sustain a Flaeaina Lendint Program
4.05        When the Credit for the large pioneering Sites and Services Project
was formally closed in 1981, many urban sector issues continued unresolved
between GOS and IDA (paras. 1.10-1.12).   This was in spite of considerable



23
efforts made by both parties to overcome outstanding differences.  It was clear,
however, that a Bank-financed urban lending operation centered only on sites and
services only could not prosper in Senegal.
4.06        Given a flagging lending program and uncertainty about the future
path to follow, pursuing an engineering credit was an appropriate tactic. This
provided a vehicle for continuation of the urban sector dialogue and permitted
new project ideas to form.  In the words of one Bank staff member, the TA Project
was "a six million dollar conversation." In retrospect, it might have been a
less expensive conversation had it focussed on those components most likely to
lead to a new project. Viewed from a broader perspective, however, the project
was successful in reviving and redirecting an urban sector dialogue that had
broken down during the long execution of the Sites and Services Project.
4.07        In synthesis, the TA Project succeeded in giving a new direction to
IDA urban lending in Senegal, leading directly to the follow-on Municipal and
Housing Development Project (Cr. 1884-SE).  The latter operation was able to
shift emphasis to issues of local development administration and finance that had
been overlooked in the Sites and Services Project. The Audit is nevertheless of
the view that the aim of preparing a follow-on project should have been stated
as an explicit objective of the TA Project.  Had this been the case, project
design could have concentrated on those components most needed for the follow-on
operation.   This would have helped make the TA Project more focussed, less
complex, and less expensive.
C.    The Need to Disseminate TA Results
4.08        The project made an important investment of some US$8.3 million in
studies and technical assistance reports. As both the PCR and this report have
noted, the quality of individual studies varied considerably. The investment
nevertheless represents a valuable heritage for those responsible for urban
sector management in Senegal today. The collection of reports was intended to
be much more than just a depository of what was the most intensive effort to
study the Senegalese urban sector to date. The quantity of information assembled
makes information retrieval and dissemination important issues. In the view of
the Audit, mere existence of this information is not enough. It needs to be
useful and be used by Senegal's urban sector managers. If the content of the
reports on housing are not known to GOS agencies operating in that subsector, for
example, how can they act on the recommendations contained?
4.09        Bibliographical work, perhaps under the auspices of the Municipal and
Housing Development Project, needs to begin urgently before the information
assembled becomes outdated in Senegal's rapidly changing urban sector. It would
be useful to publish lists of the reports available, together with abstracts of
their contents. Also, key reports should be reproduced and distributed among the
interested agencies. It is important for the country to make full use of the
large investment made in its name, on a scale that is unlikely to be repeated in
the near future.

V. BORROWER AND IDA PERFORMANCE
A.   Borrower and Executing Agency Experience
5.01        Because it involved so many GOS ministries and agencies, as well as
CUD, a thorough assessment of borrower performance under the TA Project could
easily become a review of much of Senegal's public sector.   Inevitably,
performance among the key agencies varied, but some general observations about
GOS' overall experience with the project indicate several lessons for future
operations of this kind.
5.02        In view of the institutional complexity of the urban sector in
Senegal, GOS' establishment of an ad hoc Preparation Committee to oversee project
preparation and a Steering Committee to supervise implementation were practical
solutions. These committees allowed many potentially competing authorities with
interests in urban development policy to be represented. Experience in Senegal
and other countries confirmed by that of the present project has shown, however,
that less complex management arrangements, involving clearer responsibilities and
lines of authority for individual agencies, often work more efficiently than
inter-agency c0o3ittees.
5.03        MEFP's Project Unit did a good job in these difficult circumstances,
seeing project implementation through to the end. As mentioned earlier (paras.
3.07-3.08), its performance in managing and controlling project costs, however,
was weak. Furthermore, the Unit was not vested with the authority to follow
through on the implementation of project recomendations.
5.04        GOS' ability to induce institutional change in the urban sector was
diminished by its heavy reliance on an external agent for project preparation
(paras. 2.06-2.07) when it relinquished some of its authority as urban sector
policy maker.
B.    Role of IDA
5.05        From budgetary point of view, project preparation and appraisal were
efficient, requiring only nine staff-weeks of missions through to negotiations.
The appraisal mission's task consisted of reviewing the project proposal prepared
by the consultants. The familiarity of the latter's staff with the appraisal
mission's requirements undoubtedly speeded processing.  The casualty of this
approach, however, was the effectiveness of the process in terms of building up
goverment co-itment to project objectives.
5.06        IDA fielded fourteen supervision missions, a coefficient of 3.5 staff
weeks per one million US dollar credit, representing a reasonable level effort
for such a complex operation. Because of the large volume of documents produced
at the outset, supervision mission efforts concentrated mainly on reviewing the
terms of reference for the proposed studies. This meant that IDA's attention
turned to key problems such as Government 'ownership" or cost accounting only
when it was too late.

5.07        The views of the Audit mission's interlocutors in Senegal about the
effectiveness of IDA missions were mixed. Some felt that the missions provided
a valuable opportunity for an exchange of views about urban sector policy and
brought information of relevance to the country's urban problems. Others felt
that supervision missions had an imposing style and presented non-negotiable
options for project management.  Nowhere were opinions more divided than with
respect to mission aide mhmoires: some interlocutors felt that these were amply
discussed, while others thought they were treated as if they were secret
documents. The Audit concludes that the opinions about IDA's role were sincere,
but that the differences noted were as much a reflection of conflicting views
about the value of the project itself (and the process through which it was
conceived) as about performance of the IDA missions per se.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
A.    Conclusions
6.01        The project reviewed here produced a lot of important information of
relevance to the urban sector in Senegal. Its focus on Dakar, where most of the
country's GDP is produced and more than half the urban population lives, was
appropriate for an operation ostensibly aimed at contributing to improvements in
national economic performance.   Like many stand-alone technical assistance
operations, however, its formal objectives were unrealistic.   They promised
achievements of improved resource mobilization and allocation in the urban sector
that the project provided no means (beyond studies) to attain. The Audit agrees
with the PCR (para. 19) that the expected results of the operation were out of
proportion to the resources at its disposal.   The project's implicit aim,
however, of reviving a flagging urban sector dialogue in Senegal, was achieved.
Furthermore, it successfully led to the follow-on Municipal and Housing
Development Project which has begun to address some of the policy issues raised
by the TA operation.   In summary, the Audit rates the project's overall
achievement as satisfactory, its institutional impact as partial, and its
sustainability (see para. 3.24) as uncertain. This agrees with the ratings given
in the PCR.
B.    Lessons and Recommendations
6.02        The key general lessons to be drawn from this experience include:
(i)         Technical assistance operations should be designed with the
absorptive capacities of local institutions in mind. Project
objectives need to be realistic and operational.   If well
thought out, they can help provide the focus that the present
project lacked. At the same time, they can help to identify
explicit and precise performance indicators to guide project
management and supervision;
(ii)        A technical assistance project  can be used to revive a
flagging sector dialogue. Had this been made explicit in the



26
present operation, project design might have been better
focussed to achieve this goal in a cost-effective manner;
(iii)       In a large and complex operation such as this one which
involves many agencies, it is important that institutional
responsibilities be made very clear to avoid possible
duplication of functions;
(iv)        IDA should pursue its urban sector dialogue with national
policy-makers and not just their agents;
(v)         Nearly all the project studies justifiably suffered from
inadequate data availability. Greater effort should be made
to establish permanent mechanisms to collect, store, and
disseminate data on the urban sector; and
(vi)        A survey of training needs in the urban sector is necessary
not only for the design of an appropriate training program.
It should be undertaken in order to identify the professional
skills available in the country, so that full use can be made
of them in future urban projects.
