PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN S-11-PE)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Water Supply
and Power Engineering Project in Peru (Loan S-11-PE). This loan, in the
amount of us$8.8 million, was made to the Empresa de Saneamiento de Lima
(ESAL) with the guarantee of the Republic of Peru, and was signed on
December 22, 1979. The closing date was December 31, 1983, two and a half
years behind schedule. The last disbursement was on June 26, 1984. Total
disbursements were US$8.12 million, and US$0.68 million were cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operation
Division of the Latin America and the Caribbean Region, Country Department
IV, (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). Given the time elapsed
since closing of thc loan, it is proposed that Part II not be prepared.
Preparation of this PCR was started in October 1989, and is based,
inter alia, on the President's Report, the Loan, Guarantee, and Project
Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrowers; and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN S-11-PE)
EVALUATION STMMARY
Introduction
The main objectives of Bank lending to Peru included assistance in
the creation of a physical and social infrastructure capable of sustaining
development, as well as the strengthening of agencies to implement and
operate projects effectively.
The Loan S-11-PE, aimed at the above objectives and also
supported Government efforts to improve the living conditions of a rapidly
expanding urban population. Negotiations were completed on September 8,
1978. Under the terms of the Loan, ESAL and the Mantaro Comission, the
letter created within the Housing and the Construction Ministry, were
responsible for project implementation. Although Loan S-11-PE was appro-'d
on October 31, 1978, and signed December 22, 1978 it only became effective
on June 27, 1979, due to delays in compliance with legal and financial
conditions in the Loan Agreement.
Obiectives
The principal objective of the project was to help lay a sound
basis for long-term solutions to Lima's needs in the water supply and power
sectors and prepare two projects for possibl Bank financing, the expansion
of Lima's water supply system and the Mantaro Transfer. It also aimed at
supporting organizational and financial improvements in ESAL, which were
preconditons for urgently needed investments to supply adequately Lima's
growing population, particularly those living in its slums, with water and
sewerage services.
Implementation Experience
Project implementation was subject to a number of delays (paras.
14 and 17) as a consequence of the combined effects of: (i) inadequate
political commitment; (ii) weak adminisorative capability; (iii) shortage
of counterpart funds; and (iv) lengthy bureaucratic procedures particularly
for the hiring of consultants.
Results
The project objectives, especially those of institutional
reorganization, were ambitious ana for the most part not achieved. They
depended on policy decisions which were beyond ES        control and the time
span of a single project. The policy decisions required from the
Government did not materialize.
No significant progress was made in solving ESAL's institutional
and managerial problems (poor system operation and maintenance, inadequate



- iii -
metering and billing, and poor financial and administrative management
capabilities) (para 21). However, most of the engineering studies included
in the project were completed. Those studies consisted of assessment of
water resources and demand in the Lima Metropolitan area, and the
development of a water supply and sewerage master plan.
The objective of the power sector component was achieved through
the successful completion of the Mantaro Transfer Study.
Sustainabilitv
Overall, the project had mixed results with respect to
sustainability. The Government and ESAL did little to initiate sustainable
policies, especially with regard to the latter operational and financial
improvements, hampering the possibilities of enabl,ng ESAL to administer
water resources effectively and to carry vit a major expansion program.
However, the project did succeed in improv .'  sector knowledge for future
development operations (para 23). The water and sewerage master plan for
Lima provided the basis for the follow-up project (Loan 2139-PE) aimed at
assi,cing the Government in achieving its objective of providing greater
coverage of water and sewerage services to the lower income segments of the
population.
Findings and Lessons Learned.
The stated main objectives of the Water Supply and Power
Engineering Project (Loan S-ll-PE) were to support long-term solutions to
Lima's water and power supply, and increase the efficiency of ESAL. Those
objectives proved to be difficult to achieve because of insufficient
political commitment and chronic institutional weaknesses.
The project was based on an adequate assessment of both the
institutional difficulties confronted by ESAL and the financial
requirements for long-term sustainability. However, project design suffered
from a number of problems, including: (a) lack of a long-term strategy for
institutional innovation and change; (b) overestimation of ESAL's
absorptive capacity; and (c) underestimation of the political constraints
for reform. The Bank tried to accomplish too much without enough
understanding of the complexity and difficulties implicit in any attempt
at financial and administrative reform.
The main lesson to be learned from the two component's incomplete
success in implementation terms is that institutional development is a
long-term process that should be carefully staged.

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FOMI BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
A. Proiect-Identity
Project Name    : Water Supply and Power Engineering Project

Country            Peru
Sector             Urban
Subsector        s Water Supply and Power
B. Background
1.       Sector Development Obiectives. The Bank since 1978 has been
assisting the Lima Water and Sewerage Company (ESAL) as well as the Lima
Power Company (ELECTROLIMA), with the assessment of Lima's water and power
resources. The Water Supply and Power Engineering Project (Loan S-11-PE)
fit into the Government's sectoral development strategy of improving living
conditions of the urban population through the expansion of services, while
strengthening local capacity to implement and operate water supply and
power engineering projects throughout the country.
2.       Policy Context. The main objectives of Bank lending to Peru were
to assist in (a) the creation of a physical and social infrastructure
capable of sustaining and fostering development; (b) the expansion of
productive capacity in critical sectors; (c) the consolidation of
structural and institutional changes; and (d) the strengthening of agencies
to implement and operate projects effectively.
3.       In 1980, Peru's population was estimated at 17.3 million
inhabitants, of whom 9.7 million lived in urban areas. The 6.9 million
inhabitants of Lima accounted for about 40 percent of the country's urban
population and was expected to reach 9 million by 1990. At the time of
appraisal, only half of Peru's population had access to p.table water and
only 40 percent was connected to sewer systems. To head off a water crisis,
the Government explored a number of long-term solutions. Among the options
considered was the transfer of the waters of the Mantaro river across the
continental divide and to use it for generating electricity and for
providing additional raw water to Lima's water supply system. A
comprehensive survey of the country's hydro power potential was already
under way supported by a German Government grant and funds from the Bank's
power loan (2115-PE).
4.       In 1970, the Government created the Empresa de Saneamiento de Lima
(ESAL) to provide water and sewer services to the Greater Lima Metropolitan



-2-
area. In September 1981, the Government reorganized the water supply and
sever sector to increase efficiency. A new institution, the National
Service for Water Supply and Sanitation (SENAPA) was created with the
responsibility of planning, coordinating and providing technical assistance
for all urban areas. Water companies in the largest cities, including Lima,
became subsidiaries of SENAPA with a considerable degree of financial and
administrative autonomy.
5.       Linkages Between Proiect. Sector and Macro Policy Obiectives.
Overall project objectives, in line with Government policies were to
promote gr-eater sector efficiency and financial viability, and expand
service coverage. The project was mainly oriented to support the
Government's initiative of setting the basis for long-term solutions to
Lima's water and power supply, and for future nation-wide operations in
both sectors. Both components shared the same objective of correcting
institutional deficiencies within a broad plan of increasing efficiency of
public investment.
C. Proiect Obiectives an_ escription
6.       Proiect Obiectives. The purpose of the project was to: (a) lay the
basis for long term solutions to Lima's water and power supply and for
related future investments; and (b) support organizational and financial
improvements in ESAL in order to enable it to provide adequate supply of
water and sewerage services to Lima's population.
7.       Prolect Description. The origin of the project goes back to 1971
with the Government's idea of a multipurpose project for water supply and
power generation. The proposal consisted of facilities to transfer water of
the Mantaro river across the continental divide to Lima, which at the same
time could be used for power generation at Sheque power station, and for
water supply to Lima Metropolitan area. T'e Bank had some doubts about the
rationality behind this project and agreed to finance further feasibility
studies aimed at defining the scope of the project and assessing the risks
involved in the operation. In early 1976 the Bank proposed to the Peruvian
authorities a two-part operation comprising: (i) a water supply component;
and (ii) the Mantaro Transfer feasibility study.
8.       Proiect Componentn. The project comprised two main components: (a)
the ESAL component, US$6.13 million (55.0 percent of total project cost),
and (b) the Mantaro component, US$4.97 miilion (45.0 percent of total
cost). Specifically the project included:
(a) ESAL component: (i) assessment of water resources and demand in Lima.
including a leak detection and correction, and a metering program, US$2.39
million (21.5 percent of costs); (ii) water and sewerage master plan,
US$2.04 million (18.4 percent of total costs); and (iii) strengthening of
ESAL's organization, management and finances, US$0.4 million (4.5 percent
of total project cost).
(b) The Mantaro component: feasibility studies for water transfer from the
Mantaro River for multipurpose use, water supply and electricity, and
selection of the site and timing of the Sheque Hydroelectric plant.

D. Proiect Design and Orianization
9.       The executing agencies of the pro,ect were ESAL and the Mantaro
Commissionl for the water end the power component respectively, while
COFIDE (National Development Bank) was to act as financial agent for the
project and to administer the proposed loan on behalf of the Government. It
was also entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring the adequacy of
ESAL's financial performance, as well as supervising the execution of the
financial rehabilitation program requiring the company to generate enough
revenues to cover its operating and maintenance expenditures, debt service
payments, and the counterpart funds needed for the ESAL component.
10.      Based on the information available to the identification mission
in 1976, the Bank was fully aware of both the technical, financial and
managerial weakenesses of ESAL, and of problems of financial performance
within the power sector which had a poor record in administrative, billing
and collecting procedures. The foregoing problems in the power sector were
later addresseo by Loan 2179-PE. Organizational and financial improvements
in ESAL were key elements in project design.
11.      The first part of the ESAL component consisted of studies to
assess the volume of water available from all the existing sources in the
Lima Metropolitan Area. A second part aimed at producing a water supply and
sewerage master plan for Lima, with a proposal for the expansion of Lima's
water distribution and sewerage system which would constitute th. -enter of
a possible future Bank loan. The third part was designed to strengthen the
institutional, technical and financial capabilities of ESAL.
12.      The Mantaro component comprised: (a) an optimization study to
explore possibilities for stretching existing water resources by such means
as unified management of surface and groundwater and reuse of sewage; (b)
ecological assessments (particularly the Mantaro's heavy pollution from
mine water discharges) and the impact of Mantaro transfer on existing and
proposed power stations downstream on the Mantaro, Santa Eulalia and Rimac
rivers, which together accounted for the bulk of the country's
hydroelectric capacity; and (c) selection of the site and timing of Sheque
hydroelectric plant.
13.      The two project components were designed to be interdependent but
executed by different agencies. Coordination was assigned to working groups
integrated by the Project Manager of the ESAL's component, and by
representatives of the Mantaro project unit and of COFIDE.
1/ The Mantaro Commission within the Housing and Construction Ministry
(MVC), was chaired by the president of ESAL. It included the
presidents of ELECTROPERU (National Power Company), and ELECTROLIMA
(Lima Power Company) as well as representatives of various ministries.
An implementation unit was set up to supervise execution of the
studies, including personnel from. the two power companies, ELECTROPERU
and ELECTROLIMA.

X.       :roiect ImDlementation.
14.      Project implementation was subject to a number of delays, taking
five years to execute (June 1979 - June 1984) instead of the expected two
(part III, Table 2). The closing date was extended twice. The first
extension was granted to the end of December 1982, and the second to
December 31, 1983. The main reasons for the slow pace in project execution
weret (a) slow contracting proCeduras; (b) frequent changes in ESAt's
managerial positions which led to ambiguity in both setting policies and
action plans; (c) serious conflicts between ESAL and its consultants that
hampered the impiementation of the program to upgrade the company's
institutional, technical and financial structure; and (d' financing
shortfall created by ESAL's low tariff levels and poor bill collection.
15.      Mantaro component. The Mantaro tranfer studies were completed in
Hay 1981, one and a half years behind schedule. Final dersigns and
preparation of bidding documents were provided urder Loan 2179-PE aiming at
having the project in operation by 1988.
16.      ESAL component. The implementation process was hampered by several
deficiencies in project planning and aanagement. ESAL iid not have the
appropriate structure nnr the competency and skill levels to carry out the
execution of a project cf this complexity requiring reorganization of
administrative and financial areas.
17.      Management reorganization. Assessment of ESAL was completed in
July 1980. Work was satisfactory and on schedule. The implementation phase
began in January 1981 and was supposed to be completed by June 1982.
However, considerable delays occurred due to: (a) disagreements between
ESAL and its consultants in reference to recommendations for institutional
reorganization; (b) lack of executive capacity; (c) frequent changes in
ESAL's Board of Directors that meant continuous periods of adjustments in
the decision-making process; and (d) shortage of counterpart funds. By
December 31. 1983 (loan closing date), execution was still behind schedule,
with no major progress in the design of the company's planning, engineering
and technical operations.
18.      Leak detection survey. Works started in January 1980 with a
programmed execution period of one year. Most of the leak detection study
was satisfactorily completed, but the program recommendations were not
implemen¶.ed, and there was no improvement in the system's operations and
maintenance.
19.      Water and sewerage master plan. Studies started in May 1980 and
were completed in twenty six months. However, beginning of execution of the
Master Plan's recommendations were hampered by ESAL's overall deficiencies
in implementation management and coordination. Execution of the emergency
program contained in the plan began three years later than originally
programed due to shortage of local counterpart funds. Given the
organizatiunal difficulties of ESAL, the Water and Sewerage Master Plan
proved to be overambitious, particularly during the first stages of project
implementation.



-5-
F. Prolect Results
20.      The objective of the power sec,or component was to lay the
groundwork for expanding the elertric generating capacity for Peru'.
central region and, simultaneously, incre&sing the water supply for Lima.
This objective was accomplished with the completion of the Mantaro Transfer
Study in 1981. The report concluded that the Sheque Project was the leust-
cost alternative to satisfy the demand for electricity and for water after
1988. The demand for electricity, however, did not grow as expected
because the rate of populat.on growth was lower than p:ojected and because
of the effects of the severe economic crisis in the country during the
1980s. The reviseu demand estimates for electricity, and the fact that the
Mantaro as a source of water for Lima was justified only if the electricity
component was justified, led the Government to postpone the project beyond
1995. This decision was also influenced by the size of the investment
(over US$.iO billion) which was beyond the country's financial
possibtlities.
21.      The aim of supporting ESAL's managerial and organizational
improvements was not fully achieved. The project was intended to have a
stronU institutional development effect on the entity. This proved very
difficult. Political changes of administrators and poor managerial
performance persisted during proiect implementation. ESAL's financial
performar.ce lagged behind appraisal expectations. Tariff increases remained
below inflation levels and as a result the company was unable to achieve
the improvement needed to finance the project's local costs. The severe
cash-flow problems confronted by ESAL in 2983 led the Company's Management
to reduce drastically the already insufficient ESAL's operating anad
maintenance expenditures. This poor result was due to a large extent to
ESAL's failure in reducing the water losses both by leakages in the
distribution system and by inadequate comercial procedures including lack
of consumption metering, and to the Government imposed limit on tariff
increases.
G. Proiect Sustainabilitv
22.      Overall, the project had mixed results with respect to
sustainability. It did not _ucceed in building ESAL into a strong and
efficient institution. However, it did improve sector knowledge for
forthcoming development operations by: (c) formulating a water and sewerage
master plan for Lima which provides the basis for future investments; (b)
identifying and assessing Lima's water resources, partlcularly groundwater;
and (c) preparing studies related to the long-term prospects for supplying
potable water to Lima and for expanding the country's electricity supply
(Mantaro Transfer).
B. Bank Performance
23.      The project was based on an adequate assessment of ESAL's
shortfalls Its financial and organizational difficulties were explicitly



- 6 -
stated in consultant and Bank report". However, the Bank did not fully
grasp the implications of institutional development as a long-term
strategy, particularly taking into consideration ESAL's low level of
technical, administrative and financial performance. This insufficient
grasp was reflected in the overambitious the project objectives.
I. Borrower Performance
24.      ESAL was not ready to assimilate all the changes required in the
institutional development plan within the time frame of the project. This
was aggravated by continuous changes in the entity's management and high
level staff during project preparation and implementation. Furthermore,
the Company was not receptive to consultants and Bank recommendations
during the implementation period. Its weaknesses in the areas of finances,
management, and organization persisted jeopardizing its institutional
capability to play a leading role in sector development.
J.       Proiect Relationship.
25.      In hindsight, tha Bank expected too much of the Borrower's
political and managerial capability. Furthermore, it was not realistic in
its expectations regarding the feasibility of institutional and financial
reform in ESAL.
K.       Consulting Services
26.      The technical demands for the project and the lack of adequate
engineering practices in ESAL caused heavy reliance on consultants.
Consultants performance was satisfactory both in technical assistance
operations in the finance and organizational areas, as in the evaluation of
water resources and demand in the Lima Metropolitan area. However, ESAL's
Board of Directors showed a great ambiguity in setting policies and action
plans whenever they conflicted either with the Government or the Company's
political strategies.
27.      The work of the Consultants for the Mantaro Transfer Scheme was
considered satisfactory by the Mantaro Commission as well as by the Bank.
Delays in completing the studies was mainly due to delay in furnishing to
the consultants basic information to carry out their work.
L.       Proiect Documentation and Data
28.      As is customary with engineering projects, no formal SAR was
prepared. Individual component analyses were undertaken, a synthesis of
which became a President's Memorandum. While a useful outline of the
project, it lacked sufficient insight and comprehensiveness so as to make
it a useful reference document during project execution.
29.      While progress reports were routinely furnished to the Bank, these
provided poor indications of project advance. The legal documents and the
President's Report provided the basic information for the preparation of
Part I.

Note:   As discuasod in PART I of this PCR (Paro E.), implementation of
project was marred by ingrained difficulties, affecting particularly the
execution phase of the ESAL component (Manogement Reorganization):
(i) deficiencies in project planning; (ii) lack of coordination;
(ii1) discrepancies on the implementation program; (iv) ineffective
monagement exarcebated by frequent changoo of high level staff; and
(v) ESAL's poor financial and managerial perforoance.
