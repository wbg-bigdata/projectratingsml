PRIVATIZATION AND CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT
TECHNICAL ANNEX
SECTION A: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF
THE PUBLIC ENTERPRISE SECTOR
I.   Introduction. A 1994 Public Enterprise Sector Review (Report No. 13755 COB) carried
out by partner agencies in Congo under the direction of the World Bank, and at the same time
studies by the Permanent Secretariat of the Privatization Committee, identified the shortcomings
of the public enterprise sector and provided an assessment of the resulting burden on the national
economy. It led to formulation of strategies to restructure monopoly sectors and open them to
competition, and to development of plans to privatize viable and liquidate non-viable enterprises.
The work of putting these strategies and plans into effect in advance of the next structural
adjustment program will be supported by the present project.
2.    Structure and Role of the Public Enterprise Sector in the Economy. In 1987, when
Congo adopted its first structural adjustment program, the public enterprise sector consisted of
over 100 enterprises, of which 81 were wholly-owned PEs and 15 had mixed ownership (societe
d'economie mixte), with the state holding at least 50% of the shares. The state also held a
minority share in several other mixed enterprises. By the end of 1991, the number of PEs had
declined to 71, of which 27 were mixed-ownership enterprises majority-owned by the State. In
fact, only 42 PEs were still in operation. The reduction in the size of the PE sector, still modest,
can be attributed to several factors, the most important being the deepening of the government's
liquidity crisis and the swelling of the country's external debt.
3.    During the period 1987 to 1993, many PEs ceased operations and were either liquidated
or privatized, as the Government's ability to subsidize loss-making PEs became severely
constrained. Eleven (11) PEs were liquidated, approximately 11 other loss-making ones were
partially privatized and 6 were wholly privatized'. Furthermore, the monopoly enjoyed by certain
PEs over the export of coffee (OCC), timber (OCB), tobacco (OCT), and the import and
distribution of meat (ONIVEG), consumer goods (OFNACOM) and foodstuffs (OCV) was
abolished and the PEs liquidated. It is estimated that as of April 1994, there were fifty
Government-owned or controlled enterprises. These include enterprises which have ceased
operations but have not yet been liquidated, and those which are still being liquidated. As of end
of 1994, 18 enterprises had been restructured, while only 31 remained active with the rest in
unclear legal status.

4.    In 1993, the PE sector accounted for 20 % of GDP, 12% of value added and 10-15 % of
employment in the formal sector, while its share of the Public Investment Program is significant.
5.    Performance and Weight on Public Finances. It  Box :Con2o-EvolutionofWafces
is  very  difficult  to  determine  the  actual  financial  Av. Wage (Mil/ vr.) 89 90  91  92
performance of most public enterprises due to the poor   public         1.7 2.1 3.4 3.5
quality of their financial statements and the resulting lack of   Private  3.4 3.2 3.2  3.4
transparency. However, globally, the performance of the  TOT.WAGES AS % OF TOT. RPVENUES
PE sector in Congo has been characterized , over the past                     91 92
15 years, by low productivity coupled with mounting levels I             9       9
of foreign and local debt of about CFAF 100 billion2 and 90  Public  19% 26% 36% 41%
billion respectively.  Despite CFAF 350 billion of public  Private   14% 10% 11% 12%
investments over the period of 1985-1990, the sector's total deficit reached CFAF 100 billion in
1993; and lost fiscal revenue attributed to the PE sector reached an estimated CFAF 10 billion in
1993. As of end-1993, cross debts between PEs were estimated at CFAF 140 billion and on the
rise. Furthermore, high wages constitute a major draw-back in the sector (see box I above).
6.     The Sector is dominated by six (6) PEs considered strategic by the Government3 -and thus
designated "pilot enterprises" by law- and enjoying monopoly over the key sectors of the
economy. Aggregate loss of these six pilot PEs was CFAF 13.3 billion (equivalent to about
US$40 million before devaluation) in 1992, and increased to CFAF 15.5 billion (US$47 million
before devaluation) in 1993. Accumulated losses for the six pilot PEs during the 1989 -1992
period are estimated at CFAF 32.2 billion, which represents 7% of the budget. The heaviest
losses were incurred by ATC, the transport conglomerate. Despite a decline in output during this
period, personnel expenses of the pilot PEs doubled from CFAF 24.6 billion in 1989 to CFAF
49.3 billion in 1992. Only two, Hydro-Congo and ONPT, showed a profit during this time but
neither of them paid any dividends. This poor performance of the pilot PEs is representative of the
overall performance of the sector. Key financial indicators of the pilot PEs for the period 1989-93
are summarized below:

7.    Constraints and Issues. The poor performance of the PE sector can, in most cases, be
attributed in summary to the following factors: At the sector level: (a) absence of an appropriate
institutional and legal framework; (b) shortage of expertise in policy formulation, sector oversight,
and regulation; and (c) non-payment by Government of services provided to it by the PEs. At the
enterprise level: (a) weak managerial capacity, as well as an inappropriate incentive framework to
reward and/or penalize performance; (b) absence of discipline in financial management of PEs,
and staffing and wage policies driven by political considerations, resulting in all PEs becoming
overstaffed with under qualified personnel; and (c)absence of cost-accounting systems in most
PEs, making it difficult to convince Government of the need to adjust prices of goods and services
to economic levels.
8.    In the face of the present crisis, the central objective of Public Enterprise Sector Reform in
Congo is to eliminate the heavy financial and economic burden the PEs impose oln the countiy,
while improving the quality of much needed services. Many of the problems experienced by the
public enterprises are recognized by the authorities, who have adopted the program described
below, and which: (a) calls for disengagement from operations of public services in favor of
private operators; and (b) emphasizes the Government's role of regulation and defining a
framework for private sector participation. It is important to point out that the major PEs
targeted for privatization are attractive to the private sector. Potential bidders have already
expressed interest in participating in future investments.
9.    PROJECT BENEFITS. The operation is opportune as it buttresses Government's efforts to
re-establish credibility as a major effort following devaluation just over a year ago. Moreover, it
would reduce the financial drain of the public sector and the PEs on the State, and eventually
increase fiscal revenues through improved services and private sector financing of infrastructure
for the water, power, telecommunications, and hydrocarbon sectors. The project's successful
implementation will increase economic activity and household revenues through enhanced
availability of power, water and improved transportation services, will help restore the contidence
of foreign private investors in Congo, reinforcing Government's efforts to attract private capital
and strengthen the financial sector, and produce a demonstration effect for adjustment.
10.   QUANTIFICATION OF PROJECT COSTS AND BENEFITS. Although as a capacity building
operation, no formal cost/benefit analysis was carried out, the Public Enterprise Sector Review
provides indications of the financial and economic costs and benefits of the project. Overall
financial costs of the project are estimated at CFAF 5.5 billion (US$ 11.0 million) over 3 years.
Overall financial benefits are estimated in excess of CFAF 20 billion (US$ 4 million) each year in
terms of revenue increases and budgetary savings. Some of the financial benefits of the project
will be derived from : (a) improving fiscal revenues from the petroleum sector by an estimated
CFAF 5 billion per year currently not collected by the Treasury; and (b) eliminating the drain oni
the Treasury from loss-making pilot PEs estimated at CFAF 15 billion annually for the five major
PEs. These financial benefits to the budget also, of course, yield economic benefits. The value of
the latter depends on the assumptions made about the premium on public income in Congo. For
the CFAF 20 billion a year worth of positive impact on the budget to translate into economic
benefits of thie order of CFAF 3-5 billion a year does not require unreasonable assumptions; if
anything, the bottom end of this range would perhaps be an estimate on the conservative side.
Economic benefits will be obtained by: (i) reducing economic inefficiencies which for the
hydrocarbon sector aione are estimated at CFAF 7 billion in needless overheads; and (ii) in the
power sector, decreasing technical and non-technical losses by approximately 50%.

SECTION B: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
11.   The project comprises the following four components, designed to lay the foundations for
a structural adjustment program: (a) improvement in the quality of public services; (b) overhaul
of the Government's portfolio of holdings in public enterprises; (c) preparation of financial sector
and civil service reforms; and (d) a public information campaign.
A.    Divesfiture and Quality Improvement in Public Services
12.   The Government's intentions here are: (a) to upgrade the quality of public services
through improvements in performance, to be achieved by transferring these activities to the
private sector; and (b) to restrict the role of government to formulation of sector policies and
regulation. The Government will rely on specialized consulting firms in preparing sector
development strategies, in restructuring the distribution of petroleum products and the delivery of
water, power, telecommunication and transportation services, and in seeking private investors to
take over existing public enterprises. This component of the project will provide the Government
with the means to retain consultants to assist with actual transfer of public service enterprises to
the private sector, especially those responsible for water, power, transportation, and postal and
telecommunication services and the distribution of petroleum products, as well as with creation of
a regulatory framework conducive to the development of a competitive market. The component
will also provide means to organize and launch the Permanent Secretariat of the Privatization
Committee which is in charge of program implementation.
Restructuring of Agence congolaise des communications (ATC)
13.   This public enterprise will be put under interim administration and broken up into three
separate entities.
(a)    An   already   selected   consulting  firm   will  be   appointed   official
administrator/liquidator for twelve months. During this period, it will be expected
to identify and allocate ATC assets among the three new entities, dispose of or
grant concessions on navigable waterways, develop social plans and put them into
effect, and liquidate ATC once its functions are taken over by the new structures.
The administrator will also draw up regulations to govern opening of the transport
sector to competition, and to be put into effect before privatization. The bodies
responsible for regulating sector activities are to be identified by the consultants
and reinforced as part of the project.
4



(b)    The port of Pointe Noire (PPN) is to be converted  into an autonomous,
commercially-oriented public agency. The membership of its board of directors is
to be open to users, and it will subcontract all port-related activities to the private
sector. This subcomponent is to be completed within six months of selection of
consultants, whose mandate will cover drafting of the agency's articles of
association, organization of its board of directors, setting up of its organizational
arrangements (initial financial statement, organization chart, accounting systems),
and drafting of the conditions of contract and terms of concession that are to
govern relationships between the state, users, and PPN itself.
(c)    The activities of VNPTF, the Navigable Waterways, Ports and River Transport
Authority, are to be reorganized into different entities:  the river fleet (and
shipyards, if need be) will be ceded to the private sector, subject to operational
requirements specified in the associated conditions of contract; the port of
Brazzaville will be converted into a commercially-oriented public agency, as in the
case of Pointe Noire; secondary ports will be transferred to local governments to
be operated as semi-government enterprises, or to local private investors under
concession arrangements. The consultants will draw up the legal documentation
covering conversion of the port of Brazzaville, organize its board of directors, set
up its organizational arrangements, and draft the conditions of contract and terms
of concession that are to govern relationships between the state, users, and the
port itself
(d)    CFCO (Chemin defer Congo-Ocdan) will be let under concession arrangements to
a private operator. Terms of reference for technical support with implementation
of the strategy for restructuring ATC have been agreed on with IDA and used as
the basis for competitive bidding of the necessary consulting services. Schedule I
to this present document indicates the results anticipated from restructuring PPN
and VNPTF and sets out the proposed implementation schedules. In the case of
the railway agency (CFCO), the Government intends to seek a different type of
concession arrangement, tailored to the strategy and implementation schedule
detailed in Schedule II.
Restructurinig of Office national des postes et telecommunications (ONPT)
14.     Against the background of current realities in Congo,4 ONPT will be restructured so as
to: (i) give the country the modern telecommunications facilities essential for development, and
otherwise bring it up to date in this arena; and (ii) attract more private investment. In specific
terms:
4   Although ONPT holds a monopoly on postal and telecommunication services, a private sector, with fornal (DHL) and
infonnal subscctors, has sprung up in Congo to handle the transportation and distribution of mail, not to mention the cellular
telephone services provided from outside the country (via a Zairian network).
5



(a)    A commercially oriented postal enterprise will be created, limited to distribution of
mail and packages and to philatelic activities. It will hold no monopoly and will be
reorganized so that it becomes financially self-sustaining on the basis of a policy of
free pricing and maximum subcontracting. Its relationship with the state will be
formally prescribed in an agreement backed by a business strategy, an operations
plan and a Postal Code.
(b)   All existing post-office financial intermediation  services (Caisse nationale
d'epargne, postal checks, postal money orders) will come under restructuring of
the financial sector. [Liquidation plans will be drawn up as part of this component
of the project before being handed over to the Financial Sector Restructuring
Commission for execution.] In future, services of this type are to be provided by
the banking sector after it has been restructured/privatized. The Government will,
however, define the obligations of public services existing in the financial sector
and will study the methods of provision of these services.
(c)    A commercially-oriented telecommunications corporation is to be set up and
privatized, and a new Telecommunications Code is to be drafted and enacted. The
Government already adopted the following principles for this new entity: minority
shareholding by the Government and Congolese private sectors, transfer of assets,
and development of a sectoral environment that is competitive and regulated.
Work on this subcomponent will include drafting not only of legislation and
regulations but also of licensing requirements and conditions of contract necessary
for the pre-selection of investors.
(d)   Documentation for the liquidation of remaining ONPT units, plus plans for
redeployment of staff (posts, telecommunications, retirements, voluntary
withdrawals) and settlement of severance rights, will be drawn up and
implemented.
15.   A firm of specialized consultants will be commissioned by the Government to carry out
this restructuring and to draft a new body of regulations conducive to competition in the sector.
The terms of reference for this mission, after being agreed on with IDA, were used in selecting
consultants. The tasks to be performed, the results anticipated, and the implementation schedule
are detailed in Schedule III to the present document.
Letting of Concession Contracts on Water and Power Services (SNE, SNDE)
16.   Restructuring of these two agencies is seen as a way to upgrade not only the quality of
water and electric power supplies but also access to them, and to bring down this cost. Besides
improving standards of living in Congo, this would also help revitalize economic activities and
competitiveness. From now on, the Government will limit its role in these two sectors to the
formulation of sector policy and to regulation. Operation of power and water supply services will
be handed over to private investors. Monopolies on production, transmission and distribution will
6



be terminated, and in, w sets of regulations will be introduced in order to facilitate competition,
while the Government will expand its regulatory capacity. Minority Government shareholdings in
the companies granted water and/or power concessions are not to be ruled out. The Government
will encourage and promote the participation of Congolese nationals in the capital of water and
power companies, including that of their own employees.
17.   A firm of specialized consultants will be commissioned by the Government to carry out the
concession process of water and power services, as well as to draft the necessary regulations and
to prepare plans and documentation for the liquidation of remaining water and power units. The
anticipated results of the work to be performed by these consultants, and the time schedule for full
implementation of the concession arrangements, have been agreed on with IDA and are set out in
Schedule IV to this present document.
Liberalization of importation and distribution of petroleum products (HC)
18.   The Government is seeking, first of all, to restore adequate supplies of petroleum products
to the country at competitive prices and with a positive tax flow from the hydrocarbon sector to
the treasury. These objectives can be achieved while simultaneously promoting the participation
of the national private sector at different levels of the distribution chain. The role of the State in
these areas will also be refocused on formulating sectoral policy, rate-setting and regulation. All
commercial aspects of the chain will be handed over to private operators, who are better equipped
than the Government to carry out these activities efficiently and competitively. In this connection
the downstream petroleum sector will be restructured as follows:
(a)    Storage facilities will preferably be sold or, if necessary, transferred to a new
storage company that could be set up as a pool by the oil companies selected to
distribute the petroleum products and/or by other specialized interests in the area;
(b)   Transport facilities will also be sold off and the activity liberalized.  The
establishment and development of small and medium-sized Congolese transport
companies will be promoted;
(c)   Distribution facilities will be sold to companies authorized as distributors of
petroleum products in Congo through competitive bidding procedures. These
companies will also be able to import petroleum products freely;
(d)   Distribution facilities for aviation products, lubricants, gas and chemical products
will also be sold; and
(e)    Documentation for the liquidation of the residual Hydro-Congo and CORAF,
along with a plan for staff redeployment (retirements and departures) and
settlement of severance rights will be prepared and implemented.
7



19.   The Government will engage a specialized consulting firm to implement the reforms in
accordance with the terms of reference already agreed with IDA. The activities and expected
results of privatization, along with a timetable, are shown in Schedule V.
Regulation
20.   This component will provide support for the establishment of regulatory entities and
services. For the water, electricity and telecommunications and postal sectors, this will be the
responsibility of a regulations department with specialized divisions to be set up within the
sectoral supervisory ministry. Upstream and downstream petroleum activities and the transport
sector will be regulated respectively by offices within the Hydrocarbons Directorate and the
Transport Department. The Government nevertheless remains favorable to a gradual shift in the
institutional framework of regulation to a centralized and autonomous structure.  The new
regulatory frameworks for the sectors to be privatized will be adopted and put into effect before
the actual transfer of the enterprises to private operators takes place. Schedule IX describes the
timing of privatization activities and those related to the regulation of the sectors in question.
21.   As part of the preceding subcomponent, the privatization consultants will prepare the texts
and regulatory frameworks including necessary arrangements for the protection of environment,
draft the statute and organization charts of the regulatory entities, and assess needs in training,
equipment and operations. If necessary, certain regulatory functions may be delegated to them.
The regulation subcomponent will finance the establishment of the entities, technical support and
the necessary training for their startup.
Interim management of enterprises
22.   The Government will also issue a decree appointing the interim  administrators and
specifying their powers. The main task of the consulting firms selected will be oversight of the
enterprises' operations and management until such time as their take-over by the private sector.
23.   The interim controller will directly approve all decisions regarding operating or investment
expenditures and/or commitments, as well as all decision-making regarding personnel
management including recruitment, separation and redeployment. The interim administrator and
the controller will report to the president of the Privatization Committee, while the controller will
act as advisor to the Privatization Committee.
B.    Portfolio Overhaul
24.   As part of this component, 44 liquidations under way will be completed, of which 38 by
December 31, 1995 at the latest and six by March 31,1996, at the latest; 13 non-viable enterprises
will be liquidated, of which six by December 31, 1995 at the latest and seven by March 31, 1996,
at the latest. Moreover, 11 additional PEs with potential will be transferred to the Privatization
8



Committee by September 1, 1996, at the latest for privatization, in addition to the 30 already
transferred. The Privatization Committee will complete four privatizations by December 31, 1995
at the latest, eight by March 31, 1996 at the latest, 17 by June 30, 1996, at the latest and seven by
June 30, 1997, at the latest. Schedule VI provides an inventory of the State's portfolio and, for
each of its enterprises, the timeframe and action agreed for completing the liquidations under way,
the dismantling of "empty shells," and the transfer of the entities slated for privatization to the
Privatization Committee.
25.   Law No. 020/89 determining the procedure for liquidating public enterprises allows for
satisfactory framework of liquidation.   For the implementation of the liquidations, the
Government has confirmed its agreement to use qualified private liquidators. The project will
provide the Ministry of Justice, which oversees the liquidations, with advisory technical
assistance, and will finance the services of private liquidators in order to ensure that the process is
carried swiftly and efficiently. The project will also finance the equipment and a share of the
operations of the Liquidation Department so that it can supervise the liquidations. The technical
assistance to the Ministry of Justice will provide support to the Portfolio Department in its
relations with the Privatization Committee.
C.    Financial Sector and Public Sector Reform
26.   Restructuring of the finance sector is key to the Government's program. It will return the
economy to a position of liquidity, and result in recovery of savings and a sound financial system,
including the banks and non-bank financial institutions.  A Finance Sector Restructuring
Committee was therefore established to formulate and implement the rehabilitation plan for the
financial sector. The audits and evaluations necessary in preparing for the restructuring of banks
and insurance companies, reform of the legal framework of the finance sector and settlement of
the internal debt will be financed by a grant from Japan and carried out as part of a concomitant
program. In this program, reform of the system and the institutions of social security will also be
carried out. This project component, however, will finance the costs of equipment and operation
of the Committee's technical secretariat.
27.   In the public sector, the Government will continue its staff downsizing program  by
formulating a strategy for streamlining Congolese public administration structures. To that end,
the Inspection Generale de I'Etat will receive support in the form of equipment to continue its
clean-up of civil service and debt records. The same is true for the General Secretariat of
Government for the publication of the Journal Officiel and the setting up of a database for legal
texts.
D.    Public Information Component
28.   The communications strategy for the project is as follows: (a) ensure public support, by
making Congolese stakeholders aware of the need and advantages of the planned reforms, in
particular privatization; (b) ensure transparency in the process and acceptance of the program by
9



the population; and (c) both abroad and within the country, announce the necessary structural
changes to improve the economic and business environments, as well as the regional and national
economic potential of the country.
29.   This project component will finance technical assistance to help the Government, over a
two-year period, implement the public information and awareness campaigns among the targeted
groups. It will also cover the transfer of know-how by developing local private capacity to
conduct opinion polls, target information toward the general public and employees, identify and
train spokesmen, formulate and produce targeted publicity messages and provide training in
national and international media relations. These activities will improve the public's understanding
of the economic stakes at play and the rationale of the reforms.
30.   The elements of the communications program and an implementation plan have been
agreed on with the Government. The terms of reference for technical assistance of 24 man-
months, of which 12 short-term, as well as the bidding documentation were also agreed on with
the Government. The consultant will help set up a communications unit within the Permanent
Secretariat of the Privatization Committee in accordance with the organizational framework,
profile and terms of reference agreed with the Government.

SECTION C: PROJECT COSTS AND ADMINISTRATION
1. PROJECT COSTS
31.    The total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at US$11.0 million, net of
taxes. The CFD would contribute US$0.9 million, excluding taxes, to co-finance the technical
assistance to the privatization of SNE, SNDE, ATC and ONPT. Given the financial difficulties of
the Government, its contribution to the project would be US$1.1 million, or 10% of the total cost,
in the form of the provision of personnel, premises and the operating support for the entities
involved in the project. However, as the project will not provide funds to finance the costs
related directly to staff separations and/or arrears in salaries or pensions, the Government, with
the support of the donors as part of the flow of funds, will include each year in its budget the
necessary allocations to implement employee compensation plans related to the liquidation of the
residual PEs. Already, CFAF 15 billion have been included in the Government's 1995 budget.
Detailed project costs net of taxes are given in Schedule VII and summarized in Table 1 below:

A. Recruitment of Consultants
33.   During the appraisal rmission, the Government indicated its agreement that the
qualifications, experience as well as the modalities and conditions of employment for the
consultants will be satisfactory to IDA. The consultants will be selected in accordance with
principles and procedures satisfactory to IDA, in conformity with the World Bank's Guidelines for
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency,
published by the Bank Group in August 1981. Contracts with consulting firms for more than
US$100,000 as well as contracts with individual consultants for more than US$50,000 will have
to have prior approval of IDA. However, the exemption from prior review by IDA does not
apply to: (a) the terms of reference of such contracts; (b) instances in which the Borrower
directly contacts a specific consulting firm; (c) amendments to contracts relating to the use of
consulting firms for contracts with an exchange value of US$ 100,000 or more; or (d) amendments
to contracts relating to the use of independent consultants with an exchange value of US$50,000
or more. IDA will selectively review those contracts for less than the above amount.
B. Purchasing
34.   Purchases of goods and equipment are to be made in lots in excess of US$50,000 per
contract in accordance with IDA international competitive bidding guidelines for procurement
(January 1995). IDA's model bidding documents will be used for all international bidding. Goods
of a value equal to or less than US$50,000 per contract, up to a cumulative amount equivalent to
US$300,000, may be acquired through direct international or national shopping, or through
IAPSO (Inter-Agency Procurement Office). Only contracts valued at more than US$50,000 will
have to be previously approved by IDA. IDA will selectively review those contracts for less than
US$50,000.
MIl. DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES
35.   Table 4 gives the breakdown for each category of the Credit.  The percentage of
expenditures net of all taxes or duties to be financed is 100% for consulting services, training and
equipment. Operating costs will be paid by the counterpart funds.

37.   In order to facilitate disbursements and ensure the availability of funds, the Government
will open and maintain a special account in foreign exchange in a commercial bank with terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA. The special account will be managed by the project coordinator.
The authorized amount of the special account is FF 3 million; requests for replenishment are to be
sent to IDA monthly or at any other interval decided by IDA. The Government will also have to
open a project account, distinct from the special account, to hold the counterpart funds to finance
project operating costs.
38.   Disbursements will use standard IDA documentation, with the exception of contracts with
consulting firms for an amount of less than US$100,000, and for contracts with individual
ctnsultants for an amount of less than US$50,000, for which statements of expenditure will be
14



used. The supporting documentation for these statements will be kept in the project office and
subject to verification by supervision missions and regular financial audits. The minimum amount
for a direct payment request to the Credit account will be US$100,000.
IV. ACCOUNTS MANAGEMENT AND AUDITS
39.   Project accounts will be managed by a local chartered accountant acceptable to IDA. This
full-time accountant will maintain the books and accounts and, in accordance with international
accounting standards and practices, will duly reflect the project's activities, resources,
expenditures and net worth position. The procedures manual and the computerized accounting
and assets management system prepared as part of the on-going PE project (Ln. 2868-COB) will
be maintained and utilized.
40.   The project executing agency will furnish interim and annual financial reports reflecting
the project's position and progress. These reports will have to include the annual and total cost of
the project, as well as the sources of financing.
41.   Signature of a three-year audit contract with a qualified firm acceptable to IDA will be a
condition of credit effectiveness. Agreement on the following points was reached at appraisal:
(a)    Project accounts and accounting records will be audited in accordance with
international principles audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA;
(b)   No later than six months after the end of each fiscal year, IDA will be sent an audit
report certified by the auditor for that fiscal year;
(c)   IDA will be furnished with all additional information relative to project accounting
documentation, accounts and audits as it may request from time to time; and
(d)   Without prejudice to (a) to (c) above, the accounting records of the special
account, the project account and expenditure statements will be audited in
accordance with (a) to (c) above: (i) every four months during the first 12 months
following the effectiveness date and (ii) every six months during the second 12-
month period; these audits are to be submitted to IDA no later than two months
following the end of the audit period.
42.   For all expenditures for which withdrawals from the Credit account were based on
statements of expenditure, the Borrower:
(a)    will keep accounting documentation and the related accounts;
(b)   for at least one year after IDA receives the audit report for the fiscal period in
which the last withdrawal from the Credit account or the last payment from the
15



special account is made, all accounting documentation (contracts, purchase orders,
invoices, receipts and the like) relating to such expenditures;
(c)    will allow all IDA representatives to examine that documentation; and
(d)    will have the account records and statements of expenditure audited in accordance
with the foregoing and ensure that the audit reports in question contain a specific
opinion of the auditor as to the reliability of the SOEs submitted during the period
under review, as well as the internal control procedures governing their
preparation, to justify the withdrawals made.
16



SECTION D: PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
1. PROJECT MANAGEMENT
43.   The MEFPP is responsible for project implementation.  It has appointed a project
coordinator for the implementation of project activities and Credit management. The institutional
framework for project implementation given in Schedule XI was developed in conjunction with
the Government. The SPCP is responsible for the privatization, regulation and communications
components, reinforced by a qualified consultant recruited in the local market under the financing
of technical assistance. A liquidation unit of the Ministry of Justice is responsible, in conformity
with current legislation, for implementation of the liquidation component. The unit will also be
supported by a technical advisor who will work in collaboration with the privatization advisor.
11. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
44.   A project implementation plan has been prepared (Schedule IX) and will be used by the
project coordinator and the heads of the components as a tool in project monitoring, and by the
Government and donors in monitoring the reforms. The plan complies with all IDA procedures,
time and resource constraints, and will be used to generate periodic progress reports. It also
reflects the actions already begun by the Government, particularly in the recruitment of the
privatization consultants. The project will be implemented over a 34-month period following
effectiveness expected on September 30, 1995. The Credit will be completed on December 31,
1998.
Ill. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
45.   The project coordinator will send IDA every six months a detailed report on project
implementation. The report will indicate the progress on each privatization and liquidation
process as well as each of the other project components. It will highlight existing or potential
difficulties and constraints that might affect project actions and accomplishment of project
objectives. It will indicate the corrective measures or actions envisaged by the Government. To
document the actual completion of each liquidation process, the report of the liquidator, the
findings of the audit of the liquidator's accounts and final discharge will be included as schedules.
Lastly, the report will provide a financial statement of project expenditures by component, a list
and subject of the contracts concluded during the period and whether or not the financial and legal
obligations of the Credit Agreement were satisfied.
46.   By the twenty-fifth of the last month of each quarter following the date of credit
negotiation, the project coordinator will send IDA a summary progress report by using project
management software.  The report will cover implementation and progress regarding the
structural reforms. The Borrower will submit to IDA a project completion report no later than six
months after the closing date of the Credit.
17



IV. SUPERVISION
47.   Given the variety of sectors and domains covered by the project's activities, the following
specializations will be contributed by IDA: regulation, environment, privatization,
restructuring/liquidation of enterprises; railway, energy/petroleum and transport. Project
supervision will be carried out as follows:
For IDA
(a)    Evaluation from headquarters of procurement records, terms of reference, study,
analysis and audit reports, prequalification and privatization records and the
drafting of regulatory legislation; and
(b)    Field missions to assess progress and the results obtained from technical assistance,
studies, the handling of liquidations and the implementation of the other project
components, particularly the progress made in structural reforms (Schedule X).
For the Government
(a)    Sectoral units including representatives designated by the technical ministries,
members of the SPCP and a task manager for each process who will ensure its
regular monitoring and submit the periodic progress reports (Schedule XII); and
(b)    The project coordinator and heads of components will use project management
software to plan for the management of project activities and results.
48.   Schedule XIII presents the performance indicators that will be used in monitoring the
progress of each component.
V. MID-TERM REVIEW
49.   A mid-project review will be made by the Government and IDA in the last quarter of
1996. This review will critically analyze: (a) the achievement of objectives and the results
obtained by the project in relation to the initial objectives and agreed performance indicators; (b)
the implementation of privatization plans; (c) the implementation of economic liberalization
measures; and (d) consultant performance. The mid-project review will give IDA the opportunity
to assess the Government's commitment to pursuing project objectives and economic structural
reforms.
