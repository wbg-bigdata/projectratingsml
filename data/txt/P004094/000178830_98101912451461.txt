I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Gwangju Region
1.01      Gwangju, one of Korea's poorest, least developed retgions, 1/ is a
primarily rural area in the southwest which has not participaLted significantly
in the rapid urban-industrial growth of the past 15 years.  During the 1970's
the Government formulated and began to implement a regional strategy to
accelerate Gwangju's development.  The proposed project, as well as several
previous Bank-financed projects, is an important element of t:hat strategy.
Its primary objectives are to promote industrialization and iimprove living
conditions in the region's cities and to enhance the economic prospects of the
island populace through improved transport linkages and fisheries activities.
Jeonra Nam Province
1.02      Jeonra Nam Province (JNP), with 4 million residents and an area of
12,093 sq km, accounts for 94% of both the population and area of the Gwangju
Planning Region. Government estimates indicate that in 1976 Jeonra Nam and
Jeonra Bug were Korea's poorest provinces, with per capita regional products
about 80% of the national average. IrL 1974, the primary sectors (agriculture,
forestry, hunting and fishing) accounted for 74% of the employment in JNP,
compared tc, 49% nationwide. Only 5.4% of the employment was in manufacturing,
one third of the national figure of 16.2%.
1.03      :rNP's demographic patterns are characteristic of an economically
marginal area: a stagnant population, substantial out-migration and sluggish
urbanization. Between the censuses in 1970 and 1975 JNP's population increased
an average of only 0.3% a year, compared to national growth of 2.0% per annum.
The provincial net out-migration rate, one of the country's highest, increased
from 22 per 1,000 in 1970 to 34 per 1,000 in 1975. Most migrants go to the
growing urban-industrial centers; in 1975, 78% of JNP's net out-migration was
to the Seoul metropolitan region and 9% to Busan. In 1975 only 26% of JNP's
population lived in cities of 50,000 or more, compared to 48% of the national
populace, and JNP's urban growth rate of 3.3% per annum during 1970-75 was
considerably lower than the national rate of 5.0%. The province's rural
population declined by an average of 0.8% a year during this period.
1.04      In 1976, 59% of JNP's population was totally or partially dependent
on agriculture for its income. The province is an important agricultural
center, accounting for 16% of Korea's cultivated area and 22% of food grain
production in 1976. However, farm densities are high and average yields
low, resulting in low agricultural incomes. In 1976, the average cultivated
area per farm household was .84 ha iri JNP, compared to 0.98 ha in the rest of
the nation.
1/   The country has been divided into eight planning regions (para 1.11).
Gwangju region consists of Jeonra Nam Province and two rural counties
of the neighbouring Jeonra Bug Province.



1.05      The poorest segment of the rural populace lives on the islands 1/
and depends on a mixture of aquaculture and agriculture. In 1975, 35% of the
total provincial population and 47% of the rural populace lived in coastal or
island subcounty administrative units. Part-time aquaculture is JNP's primary
fishery activity. In 1976 there were 75,966 fishermen in the province who
supported a total fishing population of 438,137. Only 5% of the fishermen
are engaged full-time, almost all employed in large offshore fishing vessels.
Among part-time fishermen, 87% practice aquaculture, normally in combination
with subsistence agriculture. In 1976, JNP produced 173,745 mt of sea-
cultured products, 45% of the national total; it accounted for 75% of national
seaweed production and 15% of shellfish production. Favorable environmental
conditions would permit considerable expansion of aquaculture production,
especially seaweed, whereas the coastal waters are already fished to near the
limit of productivity. JNP's coastal fisheries produced landings of 46,318 mt
in 1976, compared to 163,883 mt landed in the province from offshore fishing
operations.
1.06      JNP has not participated significantly in Korea's rapid industrializa-
tion. Although JNP accounted for 11% of the national population in 1976, its
share of full-time manufacturing employment was only 3%, and it contributed
only 5% to value added in the sector. According to a special labor force
survey in 1974, 17.6% of the urban employment in JNP was in manufacturing,
compared to 31.7% for all cities. The metal, petro-chemical and textile
industries are less important in JNP than in the national industrial structure;
these groups accounted for 54% of the province's manufacturing employment in
1976 compared to 75% nationwide. The food, beverage and tobacco and the
non-metallic mineral (e.g. clay products) groups are more prominent in the
province, providing 28% of the manufacturing employment in contrast to 13%
nationally. Manufacturing employment grew more rapidly in JNP during the
early 1970's when local industrial estates in Gwangju and Mogpo were being
occupied than in recent years; the scarcity of serviced industrial land in
the province is currently a constraint on industrial expansion.
Urbanization, Urban Poverty and Basic Needs
1.07      Partially as a result of the province's lagging industrial develop-
ment, JNP's cities have been unable to attract a very large proportion of the
rural out-migrants. The 1974 special labor force survey indicated that the
average household income in JNP's 4 cities was 78% of the national urban
average; Mogpo City had the lowest average income in the country. According
to Bank estimates, the urban poverty income threshold was US$220 per annum per
capita in Korea in 1977. Current estimates suggest that about 18% of JNP's
urban households had incomes below the poverty threshold, compared to 9%
nationwide. All 4 cities in JNP grew more slowly than the national
urbanization rate of 5% per annum between the 1970 and 1975 censuses:
1970-75 Average
City                  Annual Growth Rate         1978 Population
Gwangju                      4.2%                     687,000
Mogpo                        2.1%                     205,000
Yeosu                        3.2%                      144,000
Suncheon                     3.9%                     121,000
1/   JNP has a total of 1,921 islands of which 358 are inhabited.



These cities all have serious deficienLcies in basic services, especially
water supply and housing.
1.08      Eomestic water consumption in JNP's cities ranges from about 40 to
60 lcd, well below the levels considered reasonable for maintaining adequate
urban amenity and health standards. I]n Mogpo and Yeosu water supply to large
areas is limited to a few hours a day. Many urban residents in JNP have few
alternatives to municipally supplied water; the prevailing shallowness of the
alluviums and characteristics of the bedrock produce unfavorable conditions
for developing fresh ground water, a situation aggravated by pollution of
shallow aquifers by wastewater in most urban districts.  Saltwater intrusion
is also coramon along the coastal margins and on reclaimed land, particularly
in Mogpo where virtually the entire population must rely on the public system
for potable needs. The province's principal water resources are surface
supplies. The three largest cities mujst obtain water from relatively distant
sources, resulting in high unit production costs and substantial capital
requiremenits for system expansion which the financially weak municipalities
cannot undertake with their own resources. Natural constraints on urban water
supply have been compounded by deficiencies in the management of the cities'
Water Bureaus.  Especially in Mogpo and Yeosu, the lack of reliable, adequate
water supplies has impeded industrialization and other forms of urban develop-
ment.
1.09      Housing, especially for the low-income populace, is scarce in JNP's
cities as elsewhere in urban Korea. Data from the 1975 census indicate that
there are considerably more families than housing units:
Households                Shortage:           Ratio:
(HHs)        Units      HHs - Units    HHs  : Units
Gwangju           107,839       55,909        51,930            1.93
Mogpo              36,127       21,672        14,455            1.67
Yeosu              24,213       15,477         8,736            1.56
Suncheon           16,893       12,487         4,406            1.35
The 1975 urban households:units ratio in JNP, 1.75, was comparable to the
national urban ratio of 1.83. The shortage of units results in extensive
sharing of units and overcrowding.  I'n 1975 there was an average of 2.5 people
per room in urban housing units in JNP.  Korea's urban housing crisis is
attributable to the destruction of a substantial share of the housing stock
during theX Korean War and a tight system of credit allocation which has
discouraged investment in housing.  Public housing supplied, by the Korea
National Hlousing Corporation (KNHC) and municipalities has generally been
affordable only by middle and upper-:income families.
B.   Regional Plalning and Development
1.10      Korean planners have devoted considerable attention to spatial
planning issues, primarily because of land constraints (about two-thirds of
the land area is mountainous or other highland unsuitable for agriculture
or large settlements) and growing awareness of the uneven impact of Korea's



-4-
1Aie omenal economic growth.  The most important spatial policy instruments
have been incentives discouraging industrial location in Seoul and Busan,
land-use controls, development of the national transportation network, provi-
silon of local rural infrastructure through the Saemaul ("New Village") movement
aluG regional development plans and projects. The major successes of these
policies have been the diversion of industrial growth from Seoul and Busan to
s,L.~-Fes around the metropolitan centers, the virtual elimination of the gap
between average urban and rural household incomes and the establishment of a
strong system of land-use controls. However, less attention has been devoted
to overcoming regional disparities, and provinces such as Jeonra Nam, Jeonra
Bug and Gangweon have not participated fully in Korea's development.
1.11      National land-use and regional planning began during the early
1960s. A comprehensive National Land Construction Planning Law was enacted in
1963, and in 1967 a national construction plan encompassing expressways, river
basin schemes and ports was prepared. In 1971 the Ministry of Construction
(MOC) published a more comprehensive National Land Development Plan for
1972-81 which incorporated the findings of a UNDP-financed regional planning
study. The Plan divided the country into eight regions (including Gwangju),
presented sectoral analyses and identified development guidelines and priority
projects for each region.
1.12      The scope of a second UNDP-financed study initiated in 1974 to
prepare regional plans for the Seoul Capital, Busan and Gwangju Regions was
subsequently narrowed to focus primarily on Gwangju. The study's objectives
were to define measures to (1) lower out-migration, (2) reduce the disparity
in per capita incomes between Gwangju and the more developed regions, (3)
raise infrastructure and service standards to national targets, especially in
the urban areas, and (4) strengthen regional and national planning capabilities.
The study team prepared a regional structure plan and five urban land use
plans, recommended a wide range of policy and institutional measures and
identified a series of specific projects, several of which are included in the
proposed project. In 1975, in accord with the institutional agreements for
the Bank-financed Secondary Cities Regional Project (Loan 1070-KO), MOC estab-
lished a Gwangju Regional Development Unit (GRDU) in Gwangju city to increase
local involvement in the planning process. When MOC decided to establish
decentralized units in several provinces in 1977, GRDU and its functions were
incorporated in the Jeonra Nam Regional Construction Office (JNRCO) which was
subsequently renamed as Gwangju Regional Construction Office (GRCO).
1.13      The Government has undertaken several domestically and internationally
financed projects to implement its regional development strategy in Gwangju.
The Yeocheon Petrochemical Industrial Estate, begun during the 1960s, will
eventually have a gross area of 4,400 ha; 1,000 ha had been developed by 1978,
eight factories representing investments of about US$790 million were in opera-
tion and four others were under construction. The 42 ha Suncheon Industrial
Estate being developed by the Korea Land Bank 1/ will be JNP's third local
industrial estate, in addition to estates in Gwangju City (144 ha) and Mogpo
City (46 ha) developed during 1967-71. Bank-financed projects have improved
Gwangju's transport network, supported agricultural and fishery development
1/   Since March 1979, the functions of the Korea Land Development Bank have
been taken over by the newly established Korea Land Development Corporation.

and improved urban infrastructure and services. The first three Highway
Projects (Loans 769-KG, 956-KG and 1203-KG) included support for national
highways linking Gwangju City with Seoul and Busan and improved the provincial
network corLnecting the cities of Gwangju, Mogpo and Suncheon. Two Asian
Development Bank financed projects have also strengthened Gwangju's transport
network. Agricultural development has been supported by the Bank through two
Yong San Gang Irrigation Projects (Loan 795/Credit 283-KO and Loan 1364-KG)
which together will provide for the irrigation of about 54,000 ha of farmland.
1.14       The Secondary Cities Regional Project approved by the Bank in 1975
includes 2,016 serviced residential plots in Gwangju, Mogpo and Yeosu, 6.6 km
of access roads in Mogpo and Yeosu, a city market in Suncheon and a fishery
harbor complex in Yeosu with on-shore facilities, including a market and cold
storage.  Civil works for the project were substantially completed in July
1978, an overall delay of only 6 months; costs were only about 10% over the
estimate at appraisal in spite of substantial inflation. A saving of US$4.0
million in the loan amount occurred, mainly due to devaluation of the Won in
1974, which is being used for project-related expenditures including water
supply improvements in Yeosu and deta:iled design of the proposed project.
The first project's main innovations were in housing and regional planning.
The project broke important new ground in providing long-term financing for
lot purchasers for the first time in Klorea. The serviced plots also provided
Korea's first experience with inexpensive core housing affordable by low-
income families (the core houses were built independently by KNHC). Consid-
erable over-subscription (7,700 applications for 2,016 plots) indicated the
popularity of this approach with low-income families, and profitable open-
market sales of about 40% of the net saleable area of the project sites
demonstrated how cross-subsidies can be used to lower prices for poorer
purchasers.
1.15       The institutional arrangements and technical assistance introduced
as part of the project supported decentralized regional planning and enabled
provincial and local authorities to play important roles in identifying and
preparing the components of the proposed project. Studies iEinanced by the
Secondary Cities Regional Project and conducted by an association of foreign
and local consultants assessed the feasibility of 13 projects categorized in
three groups according to their primary objectives; seven oiE these are included
in the proposed project:
Included in                 Excluded on Technical*
Project Type          Proposed Project                  or Oither Grounds

The other components of the proposed project were prepared by GRCO with the
assistance of local consultants and Bank missions.
1.16      The proposed project (Map 14063R) would reinforce other investments
in Gwangju and play an important role in the implementation of the regional
development strategy formulated with UNDP and Bank assistance. By stimulating
development of JNP's coastal and island areas, the fisheries components and
bridges would complement agricultural projects in enhancing primary sector
income-earning opportunities, thereby reducing migration from rural areas.
The urban components will improve JNP's ability to retain its population and
encourage rural migrants to remain in the province rather than going to Seoul
or Busan. The industrial estates will accommodate a significant increase in
manufacturing employment, the water supply projects in Mogpo and Yeosu will
remove critical bottlenecks to expansion, the transport projects in Yeosu will
improve the efficiency of its landuse and transport patterns and the housing
estates will reach a group not currently served by public programs. Compared
to the first regional project, the proposed project places considerably more
emphasis on direct employment creation and income enhancement and has broader
geographic and sectoral focuses.
1.17      Institutionally, preparation of the project has encouraged central
and provincial authorities to cooperate in developing a more comprehensive,
integrated perspective on the region's needs and identifying priority invest-
ments. The Bank's paticipation in this process has helped the Government
translate its regional plans into well-designed subprojects, several of which
introduce important innovations, much sooner than if they had been prepared
as individual projects. The proposed project has been formulated in such
a manner as to ensure that the Bank's policy/administrative procedures and
appraisal standards could be met while causing minimal disruption to the
Government's multi-sectoral, decentralized, evolving and yet efficient approach
to regional development. In the formulation and appraisal of the project,
every effort has been made to work through the existing administrative struc-
ture, to support institution building at the city and provincial levels and
to use conventional Bank procedures in a flexible way to accommodate a unique
project.
II. PROJECT COMPONENTS, COSTS AND FINANCING
A. The Project
2.01      The proposed project is designed to further enhance the development
of the Gwangju Region. It follows the Government's strategy for reducing
regional imbalances through industrial decentralization, development of
secondary cities and increased primary sector productivity. Specifically, the
project is aimed at: (a) promoting industrialization in the region's cities
to expand employment opportunities, (b) improving living conditions in the
urban areas, and (c) increasing the income-earning opportunities of the
region's island population through improved transport linkages and fisheries
activities.

B. Detailed Features
Housing Estates
2.03      The housing component will expand on the experience of the first
regional project which has been successfully implemented. The three housing
sites will be located in Gwangju (31.9 ha), Mogpo (18.5 ha) and Yeosu (17.2
ha) with about 1,850, 1,115, and 980 residential plots respectively (Maps
14064R, 14065R1 and 14066R). About 2,950 core houses will be constructed on
nearly 75% of the plots. Satisfactory sites in the three cities have been
selected; land acquisition is in process. Site selection has been based on
land pricEs, accessibility to employment centers, physical attributes of the
land, suitability for mixed residential development and conformity to master
plans.



-8-
211)4     Nearly 60% of the net residential area on each site will be devoted
to low-income housing. The remainder will be sold in the form of 50-70 py
(165-230 sq m) plots at market prices for middle-income housing. The profits
generated from sale of these plots will be used to cross-subsidize low-income
oi * The low-income housing would consist of: 9 py (30 sq m) core-
houses expandable to 16 py on 27 py plots (90 sq m) and 12 py (40 sq m)
es er-andable to 18 py on 30 py (100 sq m) plots, roughly in equal
proportion. The housing estates will be fully serviced with roads, water
supply, drainage, electricity, etc., according to the standards summarized in
Chapter IV. The site plans will provide adequate space for commercial and
community facilities which will be constructed and operated by relevant city
agencies.
2.05      The 9 py core-house, designed for families at about the 25th per-
centile of the household income distribution curve in project cities, would
consist of two rooms, a toilet and a kitchen. The house would be expandable
to 16 py on the ground floor, corresponding to maximum permissible coverage
of 60% on the 27 py plot. Future expansion on the second floor would also
be possible as an option. Because of the severity of Korea's winters, it is
essential to provide a heated, habitable core for initial occupation. The
house designs have been developed after a study of housing in the first project
which analyzed the alterations and additions made by the occupants as well as
their views on the designs.
2.06      The proposed size of the 9 py core-house is small compared to a
house in a conventional public or private housing project, where the pre-
dominant range of house sizes is 13-25 py. Rising construction costs and
high mortgage terms (currently 16.5% for 20 years) make even a 9 py core-house
beyond the reach of households in the bottom half of the income distribution.
As a result, the core houses are being designed to permit a rental room to
supplement household income and to expand the supply of rental rooms and lower
rental costs to the low-income groups. In addition, cross-subsidization
through market sales of larger, open plots and a graduated mortgage plan will
be employed to make the houses affordable by the target income group (paras
6.16-6.18).
Industrial Estates
2.07      Fully serviced industrial estates are proposed to be developed at
Hanam Myun on the outskirts of Gwangju (Map 14064R) and at Hadang across from
the existing estate in Mogpo (Map 14065R1). The gross area of the Gwangju and
Mogpo industrial estates would be approximately 450,000 and 150,000 py,
respectively. Development would include access roads and on-site road net-
works, water supply, surface drainage, electricity and telecommunication.
The sites would be landscaped; recreation fields will also be provided on
the Gwangju site. In addition, administrative buildings providing space for
1/   This technique was successfully used in the first project where nearly
the entire cost of land acquisition and infrastructure development was
recovered through sale of only 30% of the larger plots.



- 9 -
facilities such as a bank, post office, medical clinic, cafeteria, recreation
room, conference rooms and convenience shopping will be provided on each site.
Standard factory buildings with total floor space of 9,500 py and 3,200 py in
Gwangju and Mogpo, respectively, will also be built. These would be sold (on
installment terms) in flexible modules to small-scale industries. Industries
locating oni the estates would have access to sufficient existing sources of
finance for equipment and working capital so that special arrangements for
this type of credit will not be made in the project. It is estimated conser-
vatively that when fully occupied, the two industrial estates would employ
about 18,000 workers.  Analysis of the composition of the industries likely
to be attracted to the estates suggests that manufacture of machinery and
equipment (including electronics), textiles, apparel and chemical and rubber
products will probably be predominant in Gwangju, whereas activities more
dependent on local resources (e.g., food and beverage, non-metallic mineral
and wood products) will be prevalent in Mogpo.
2.08      During project preparation and appraisal, Bank missions studied
demand for the proposed industrial estates to determine appropriate project
scales. Tre review was based primariLy on analysis of trends in manufactur-
ing output and employment in JNP and Gwangju and Mogpo cities, compared to
national trends. It is conservatively estimated that manufacturing employ-
ment in Gwangju will increase from 23,000 in 1976 to approxiimately 62,000
in 1987; employing estimates based on recent trends of the proportion of
new manufaczturing activities locating on industrial estates and of employ-
ment density factors, this projection indicates demand for approximately
600,000 py of industrial estate land between 1980 and 1986 alone. Manufac-
turing employment in Mogpo is expected to increase from 8,600 in 1976 to
approximately 20,600 in 1987, creating demand for 200,000 py of industrial
estate land between 1980 and 1986. A field survey covering approximately
65 companies in Gwangju and Mogpo, as well as a few in Seou]L, indicated
industrial estate demand for 713,000 py in Gwangju and 449,500 py in Mogpo,
confirming the results of the analysis of secondary data. After discussions
with officials of EPB, MOC, JNP and the city governments, the scale of the
industrial estate projects was set at 450,000 py and 150,000 py gross area
in Gwangju and Mogpo, respectively.
2.09      It is proposed to supply water to the Gwangju industrial and housing
estates from the city system. The alternative of an independent supply system
from nearby Hwang Yong River has been studied by consultants and judged unsuit-
able due to inadequate flows in the dry season. The ground water potential of
the area is being explored. The geology of the area suggests that modest sup-
plemental supplies from wells might be feasible. The project includes four
drilled test wells to better define the degree to which grolandwater might use-
fully augment the supply from the municipal system. The Gwangju water supply
system is inadequate to meet the present need. A water supply expansion proj-
ect for Gwangju is being prepared as part of a secondary cities water supply
project for which the Government has requested Bank financing. Water supply
feasibility studies for the three cities involved (Masan, Daegu and Gwangju)
are expected to be completed by December 1979. A substantial portion of the
engineering studies for the Gwangju water supply project, which is to increase
supply by 250,000 mtd, has been completed. The local and central governments
are keen to expedite the proposed water supply project; consultants for the
Gwangju water supply feasibility study have commenced work. The Gwangju water



- 10 -
system needs to be expanded by 1982-83 to supply the proposed industrial and
housing estates. In the event of a delay in implementation of the water supply
project, the initial needs of the housing and industrial estates could be met
by converting the test holes into production wells. During negotiations, the
government assured the Bank that implementation of the proposed Gwangju water
supply project will be expedited to ensure an adequate and timely supply of
water to the Gwangju industrial and housing estates.
Mogpo Water Supply
2.10      The project would add 25,000 mtd capacity to the city system through
construction of a 19 m high rockfill dam and 7.7 million cu m impoundment at
Daedong, a surface water treatment plant, two transmission pump stations,
about 25 km of transmission and distribution lines in sizes up to 700 mm,
and a systematic program to identify and substantially reduce water losses in
the existing system. Mogpo city started construction of the Daedong Dam and
transmission and treatment works in 1973, using local capital resources. Work
on this program stopped in 1976 due to lack of funds; the proposed project
will take advantage of the works completed to date.
2.11      The project will benefit nearly all residents of the city through
improved water services; domestic supplies will increase from 52 to 105 lcd.
Service will be extended to about 2,000 new households by which time the city
system would serve 98% of the population. The project will also include a
leakage control program to reduce the amount of unaccounted water from the
current level of about 40% to 30%. Technical assistance (para 5.07) is
included to assist the City Water Bureaus in operation and management of the
water system.
Yeosu Water Distribution Project
2.12      The first phase of the Yeosu Water Supply Project, which includes
transmission, treatment and storage facilities, is being financed through
savings from the Secondary Cities Regional Project (Loan 1070-KO); it will
increase the existing system capacity from 16,000 to 46,000 mtd, adequate
until 1990. The undertaking will restore satisfactory service conditions and
permit domestic consumption to rise from 50 to 100 lcd. The proposed project
will complement the works financed under the first project by a selective
expansion of the city's distribution system to meet 1985 goals for population
served. About 7,000 new households (35,000 people) will be extended service.
The project will also include a pumping station, a storage tank, and distribu-
tion nucleus on Dolsan island, an important stimulus to island development.
A total of about 14 km of new pipelines and replacement of approximately 6 km
of existing lines are involved.
Narodo Development
2.13      Narodo, a pair of islands with about 15,000 residents, is located
just off the mainland in southeast JNP. The islands have good potential for
development in tourism and fisheries. MOC places high priority on development
of Narodo for which the main constraints are transportation and water supply.
The current transportation link with the mainland is limited to ferry service
handling passengers and cargo, but no vehicles. A proposal to link inner and



- 11 -
outer Narodo to the mainland through two bridges, each about: 500 m long, was
investigated as part of this project; the bridges have been deferred to a
later date for lack of traffic. Narodo village, the principal community in
the islands, is facing serious water supply shortages. Present supply is so
limited that piped service is available only briefly every other day, and
many residents must pay high prices for water barged to the town from streams
at the opposite end of the island. Present supply to residential users is
estimated to be only 35 lcd.
2.14      liarodo Development project is aimed at improving the water supply
and transport linkage to mainland. The water supply component consists
of rehabilitation of the existing slow sand filter plant and addition of
about thirty 20-m deep drilled wells, well field collector pipes, booster
station, chlorination and storage facilities. The project would permit supply
of about 70 lcd to 90% of the projected 1985 population as well as meet the
needs of the seasonal tourist and fishing populations.  About half of the
production would be allocated to commiercial and industrial users, tripling the
present supply to these customers and permitting domestic rates to be cross-
subsidized. Water losses in the existing piping network will be reduced
through a program of leak repair and installation of meters on service lines
of selected larger customers.  The transport component consists of upgrading
the ferry service between mainland Narodo to be able to hand[le vehicular
traffic. rhe project, which is under preparation, will provide four ferry
terminals (one on mainland, two on inner Narodo and one on outer Narodo) and
upgrade about 7 km of road on inner Narodo to a gravel surfaLce. A provisional
sum of US$0.5 million is provided for improvements to ferry service infra-
structure at Narodo.  The ferry service itself is to be operated by a private
company.
Yeosu Commercial Road
2.15      Yeosu's central business district (CBD) is located between old
and new ports and continues toward the Fisheries Harbor Complex constructed
under the first regional project (Loan 1070-KO).  Access between the two
areas is presently provided by the Court House Road which carries all through
vehicular traffic.  Based on the consultants' analysis, traffic is growing at
a rate of 4.5% per annum, and the Court House Road will exceed its capacity in
1984. An existing alternative access, the Commercial Road, is unsatisfactory
in its present condition because of unpaved portions, restricted widths and
congested conditions due to heavy pedestrian and nonmotorized vehicular
traffic.
2.16      The proposed project (Map 14066R) would upgrade the Yeosu Commercial
Road to a f-our-lane paved road to provide an arterial roadway bypassing the
CBD and improving vehicular access to many businesses and residences. The
proposed design and alignment of the road have been selected after careful
review of alternatives (para 4.06).  The alternative of construction of two
lanes with provision for future expansion to four lanes was considered but
dropped for practical reasons (para 4.07). The alignment selected minimizes
relocation of properties; about 91 residential structures an,d 10 factories
(total area 3,075 sq m) will have to be relocated to permit widening of the
road. The city government has agreed to help displaced residents and factory
operations find alternative accommodation (para 3.13).

Dolsan Bridge
2.17      Yeosu is an expanding industrial and commercial port city with
',T.7 C4 snM2 nort and associated industrial complex; it also services the
nearby Yeocheon industrial complex. If current growth trends continue, or are
accelerated as expected, Yeosu will experience severe land pressures. Steep
topograpny limiTs the amount of land suitable for residential and commercial
development. The availability of relatively low-cost residential land in
the northern part of Dolsan Island offers an alternative to the considerable
densities forecast for Yeosu by 1985. On the basis of the projected growth
in traffic, construction of a bridge between Yeosu and Dolsan is a better
alternative than expansion of the existing ferry service.
2.18      The proposed project would provide a steel girder bridge, 430 m
long and 10.6 m wide, to link Dolsan with Yeosu in the vicinity of the Fishery
Harbor Complex (Map 14066R) and about 1,200 m of approach road. A pedestrian
walkway would link the bridge to existing walkways leading to the city center.
Jindo Bridge
2.19      Jindo Bridge, linking Korea's third largest island with the main-
land, will stimulate development of the island's agricultural and tourism
potentials. Jindo, with a total area of 345 sq km had 100,000 residents in
1975. The majority of the population is employed in agriculture (about 84%),
and between 1970 and 1977 agricultural income increased at an annual rate of
4.5%.  Tourist visits to the island have increased significantly during the
1970's. Major land reclamation projects are underway and the amount of land
available for agricultural production is projected to increase by 36% (15,200
ha) by 1991. Presently, there is an inadequate ferry service between Jindo
and mainland; between 1970-77 ferry passenger traffic grew at an annual
average rate of about 21% and cargo traffic at a rate of 37%. The proposed
project is designed to replace the Jindo-mainland ferry with a 480 m cable-
stayed suspension bridge and 700 m of approach roads. The width of the bridge
would be 10 m, with two lanes for vehicular traffic (7.2 m wide) and footpaths
on each side. Provincial Highway 805 on Jindo and Provincial Highway 802 on
the mainland, which connects the island with Haenam, Gwangju and Mogpo, are
scheduled to be paved and upgraded to national highways in 1979-80. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that these highways will be improved before
completion of the bridge.
Shrimp Storage Facility at Imja Island
2.20      Imja, an island situated about seven miles off the mainland in
northwestern JNP, has a population of about 1,400 engaged mostly in shrimp
fishing and farming. In 1975, JNP contributed roughly 16% of the national
catch of the small shrimp used in preparation of the Korean national dish,
kimche; 62% of the provincial catch (1,300 mt) was landed at Imja. There are
presently 109 vessels based at Imja engaged in strow-netting for small shrimp.
The fishing season for the tiny, but mature, shrimp extends from April to
November, whereas demand is greatest during October to December when cabbage
is available for kimche preparation. The shrimp is fermented in brine for
about 18 days, then packed in polythene liners in 55 gallon drums and stored
underground or in tunnels at constant temperatures of about 180 c.  For lack
of storage facilities, the fishermen sell their catch to brokers at very low



- 13 -
prices (recently averaging about W 100,000 per drum) during the fishing season.
The brokers store the shrimp on the mainland for retail during the winter at
about W 200,000 per drun.  The project's objective is to enhance the incomes of
about 600 f ishery families by providing a storage facility on the island and
better marketing of their catch.
2.21       The project will consist of a series of four tunnels in a hillside
1 km northeast of the island's principal village and landing place, Cheong-
changpo. Each tunnel, 100 m long, will be horseshoe shaped, 3.8 m wide at
bottom and 3.0 m high, with provision for ventilation, and fitted with loading
rails.  The capacity of the four tunnels will be 2,550 drums.  The facility
will also include a 60 m jetty for landing and shipping the shrimp. The
facility will be operated and managed by the fishermen's cooperative.  The
cooperative has a suitable vessel for transportation of shrimp to the mainland.
Aquaculture Development
2.22       I'he proposed project would expand laver 1/ production in JNP to
meet domestic demands and increase the incomes of laver farmers, presently
one of the poorest groups in the rural population. The primary emphasis
will be on productivity increases and quality improvement in laver by:
(i) replacing the outdated and less productive bamboo slat growing units with
more productive floating net units; (ii) expanding production to new growing
areas; and (iii) introducing seed prodLuction units and modern processing
facilities which will improve the quality of the laver and stabilize produc-
tion by protecting growing units from the effects of unseasonal weather. The
project will consist of a credit scheme operated by the provincial branch of
the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives (NFFC) and a technical
assistance program to expand extension and demonstration services, research
and training through the fisheries promotional offices in the province.
2.23       I'he credit scheme will provide loans to:
(a) laver farmers to finance about 10,000 net units for
r eplacement of the existing bamboo units and expansion
of laver production area; and
(b)  regional cooperatives for the establishment of five seed
culture facilities, 25 laver processing plants and one
net freezing and cold storage plant to accommodate about
50,000 seeded nets.
Conversion from bamboo slat to floating net units and expansion of the growing
area would increase laver production in the project area by about 10% or
almost 1 million bundles, the present value of which is around W 3,000 million.
In order tc, spread the benefits of this investment as widely as possible,
credit to the laver farmers will be restricted to 5 to 10 units per household.
The net freezing and storage facility would help laver farmers to extend the
growing period and also reduce the risks from the hazards of warm temperatures

square sheets.



1 t 
and high velocity winds which occur frequently in the area. It is expected,
that this facility would increase the production of the 50,000 nets by about
25% and the benefits would accrue to approximately 5,000 laver farmers.
Technical Assistance
2.24      The technical assistance component of the project includes funds
for:  (i) improvement of water supply operations, especially financial manage-
ment and maintenance, in JNP's cities, (ii) aquaculture technical services,
(iii) a study of the development potentials of various islands in JNP to
prepare a development plan, (iv) preparation of a third regional development
project, and (v) development of regional planning capabilities including
training and fellowships for MOC staff (paras 5.07-5.11).
C. Cost Estimates
2.25      The total project cost is estimated to be W 75.1 billion (US$154.8
million) of which the foreign exchange element (both direct and indirect)
is estimated at 42%. The taxes and duties element of total project cost is
estimated at US$10.1 million. Summary of project cost estimates are given
in the following table, and estimate for each subproject are shown in Tables 1
to 8 of Annex 1 and for technical assistance in Annex 4. Project costs were
estimated by consultants 1/ and Bank staff on the basis of preliminary engi-
neering designs and field investigations carried out for detailed design.
2.26      All cost estimates are based on June 1979 prices and include land
acquisition, construction works including profits and overheads, design and
supervision and physical and price contingencies. Physical contingencies
are 15% of construction costs. Price escalation is based on the following
yearly rate of increase in construction costs: 10% in 1979; 9% in 1980 and
8% in 1981-83, in accordance with the Bank guidelines. This is a conserva-
tive estimate, given the rapid increase in construction costs during the past
two years in Korea, but the Government is giving high priority to curtailing
inflation. The overall price contingency amounts to about 20%.
D. Financial Arrangements
2.27      The proposed Bank loan of US$65 million will finance the pro-
ject's foreign exchange requirements. The loan will be made to the
Government of the Republic of Korea (ROK) which will pass the funds on as
loans and grants to the project agencies (i.e. city governments, cooperatives
1/   A joint venture of Trans Asia Engineering Associates and Korea Engineering
Consultant Corporation was engaged by 40C in December 1978 for detailed
design of project components; the consultants are expected to complete
the task by December 1979.

and MOC). The ROK would contribute about 13% of total project costs (W 9,779
million) to the project agencies as grants for design and supervision and
costs which the agencies cannot recover. About 4.5% of total projects coEst
(W 3,330 million)  will  come  from  the  Government  as loans.   The government
loans will be made to executing agencies for aquaculture development, shrimp
storage projects and through the Korea Development Bank (KDB) for the water
supply projects.
2.28          The  project  agencies  will  finance  the  portion  of  project costs  not
covered by the Bank loan or Government contributions from their own resources
or other borrowing. It is anticipated that city governments will borrow about
13.5% of total project costs (W 10,143 million) mostly as short-term loans
from the Korea Housing Bank (KHB) for their shares of the housing projects.
The remaining 27% of total project costs (W 20,314 million) to be provided
by the cities will come from advance payments for the industrial estates and
other borrowings. The mission was satisfied that the cities will be able
to raise the funds required. The financing plan for the project is shown

Terms of Loans
2.29      ROK will repay the Bank loan over a 17 year period including an
initial four-year grace period at the interest rate prevailing at the time of
loan approval. The Government will be responsible for paying the Bank interest
during the four-year grace period, which roughly corresponds 1to the project's
construction period. ROK will bear the risk of fluctuations in the exchange
rates of the currencies in which the Bank loan is made.
2.30      In accordance with normal government practice, it is proposed that
the Bank loan will be on-lent to the project agencies through Subsidiary Loan
Agreements at the same interest rate as the Bank loan to the Government of
Korea, plus 0.05% for handling charges, for 17 years with a four year grace
period.
2.31      Loans to project agencies from financial intermediaries will be made
on prevailing terms. The terms of the KDB loans to the Cities of Mogpo, Yeosu
and Narodo for the water supply projects will be 20 years inc:Luding 5 years
grace, at 7.5% interest. The current terms on loans by the KHB for the
housing estate projects are 20 years, including 3 years grace, at 16.5%
interest. The terms of the loan for aquaculture development and shrimp
storage from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to the NFFC are assumed to be
at 8.6% to be repaid over 10 years with a 2 years grace period. Terms and
conditions for the above loans were confirmed during negotiations.
2.32      The KHB rates are in line with current market rates.  The KDB and
NFFC rates are lower, but special rates are not proposed due to the small
size of the project-related loans in the agencies' overall lending operations.
Partially due to substantial interest spreads, the industrial estates and
shrimp storage projects will generate profits to the implementing agencies;
it has been agreed that these profits will be earmarked for land acquisition
or future development projects. This was confirmed during negotiations.
III. EXECUTING AGENCIES AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
A. Project Agencies
3.01      The Ministry of Construction (MOC) will be reponsible for the design
and construction of all project facilities, which will be turned over to the
operational agencies when completed (Chart III-1). MOC's National Physical
Planning Bureau, particularly the Regional Planning Division, has central
responsibility for reviewing project design and execution. The Gwangju
Regional Construction Office (GRCO), located in Gwangju City, will be
directly responsible for supervising the design consultants, evaluating bids
and awarding contracts, and employing consultants to supervise construction.
Two of GRCO's five sections, the Planning and Regional Development Sections,
have been working almost exclusively on, supervision of the first regional
project and preparation of the proposed project. Civil works in the first



- 18 -
project have generally been well executed, with only minor delays and cost
overruns. Execution of the first project and preparation of the proposed
project has encouraged close collaboration among the National Physical Plan-
ning Bureau, the Provincial Government and the operating agencies and fostered
a more comprehensive, integrated perspective on regional development among them.
3.02      The governments of the Cities of Gwangju, Mogpo, and Yeosu will be
responsible for the operation and maintenance of the housing estate, industrial
estate, water supply, and urban transportation projects. All three cities
participated in the first regional project. In Korea 33 cities (excluding
Seoul and Busan) and 138 counties (which are further divided into towns and
villages) are the basic units of local government under the supervision of
9 provincial governments and the central government. In Korea's highly cen-
tralized administrative system, city governments have little autonomy and the
cities are heavily dependent on provincial and central subsidies.
3.03      Chart III-2 indicates the organization and staffing of Gwangju,
JNP's largest city. The organizational structures of the Mogpo and Yeosu
City Governments are similar but somewhat less differentiated, and in mid-
1978 they had 696 and 294 employees, respectively. Data on the three cities'
revenue and expenditure patterns are available in the Project File. In
1976-77 subsidies accounted for 42% of their total general account revenues
during these years. Constraints on city finances severely limit the amount
of capital development they can undertake. Retention of profits from the
industrial estate projects in development funds (para 2.32) and water rate
increases (para 6.13) will improve the cities' financial positions.
3.04      The shrimp storage and aquaculture projects will be managed by the
Office of Fisheries (OOF) and the fisheries cooperative movement. OOF is a
branch of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MOAF) which provides
policy guidance on promotional and regulatory matters concerning fishing,
local and foreign trade and supervises the cooperative movement. The tech-
nical assistance component of the aquaculture project would be administered
by the OOF, through the Fisheries Promotion Offices in Mogpo and Yeosu. The
current staff of 35 extension workers in the offices would be increased to 55,
and more emphasis will be placed on laver production in extension services.
The additional staff would permit extension workers to cover all laver produc-
tion areas in the province and to have direct contact with farmers in their
own growing environments.
3.05      The Korean fisheries cooperative movement is an integrated, national
organization with statutory responsibilities and functions specified in the
Fishery Cooperative Law (1973). Chart III-3 provides a structural overview
of its organization. The activities of the National Federation of Fisheries
Cooperatives (NFFC) encompass marketing, including exports and operation of
several coastal and inland fish markets; credit operations; fishery guidance
and extension services; supply, including sales of tax-free fuel; price
support programs; insurance, and medical services. The NFFC marketing net-
work, through which shrimp from the storage facility would be sold, currently
handles 71% of the fishery products consumed nationally. NFFC credit opera-
tions are financed primarily by loans from the Government and Bank of Korea



- 19 -
as well as by member deposits. Its portfolio has been overextended as annual
loan advances have grown from US$44 miLlion (for 26,000 loans) to US$186 million
(for 20,000 loans) during 1973-77. Loan recovery has been improving, arrears
represented 3.5% of loans due for collection in 1977. The current financial
position of NFFC is weak; nevertheless it is considered as the most appropri-
ate agency t o handle the credit scheme. A recent Asian Development Bank Loan
(December 1978) is addressing NFFC's fiLnancial and institutional problems.
NFFC's liquidity position will be improved through long-term, low interest
loans from government. In addition, consultants will be hiretd under the ADB
project to review entire operations of NFFC to improve accounting and report-
ing systems of NFFC, examine the adequacy of interest spread on its loan
operations and determine a suitable capital structure for NFF'C. Chart III-3
also depicts the organization of the Shinan County Fisheries Cooperative
Association, the operational agency for the shrimp storage facility. The
Shinan Cooperative embraced 19 village cooperatives with 1,942 members and
had 42 employees in 1978; its main activities are operation c,f the Mogpo Fish
Market and consignment sales of seaweed and lugworm.
B. Special Issues in Project Management
3.06       The distribution of administrative responsibility for project im-
plementation is described in Chart III-1. The administrative plan generally
follows current practices which the mission considers adequate for most aspects
of project management. Innovative pro,zedures and special arrangements to be
introduced as part of the project are described in the following paragraphs.
Staffing of GRCO and MOC Regional Planning Division
3.07       Primarily because of Korea's successful competition for foreign
construction contracts, MOC's professional staffing has deteriorated during
recent years. GRCO currently lacks the technical and administrative resources
necessary to supervise and support the consultants preparing the detailed
designs adequately. Although the situation improved somewhat: in November 1978
with the appointment of an experienced engineer at the Section Chief level,
more staff are still required. Similarly, the National Physical Planning
Bureau's Regional Planning Division ne,eds to be strengthened to plan future
regional development projects.  GRCO was reorganized in May 1979 to cope with
the implementation load of this project. A new construction division has been
added; the two construction divisions are now responsible for projects in re-
lated sectors.  During negotiations, MOC assured the Bank that by December 31,
1979, the professional staff of GRCO will be increased by nine engineers and
five administrators and three additional engineers will be appointed in the
Regional Planning Division of MOC.
Industrial Estate Projects
3.08       Sales of Factory Modules:  Industrialists who purchased land in the
existing estates in Gwangju and Mogpo had to finance and construct factory
buildings t!hemselves. In order to increase small industries' access to the



- 20 -
new estates, minimally developed modular factory buildings will be sold on
installment terms to enterprises with less than 50 employees in the proposed
project. The eligibility ceiling for purchasing modules is based on the
assumption that virtually all industries locating in the estates will have
at least 20 workers; in JNP in 1976, establishments with 20-49 workers
accounted for 58% of the manufacturing establishments with more than 20 workers
and 18% of the total employment in all such establishments. Because of the
experimental nature of the approach in Korea, factory modules will be sold
in two phases, each encompassing approximately 3.7% of the net saleable site
area. The cities will have the option, in consultation with the Bank, of
not implementing the second phase if there is little initial interest in pur-
chasing the modules.
3.09      Marketing Plan; Allotment Priorities:  Both cities have had experi-
ence selling serviced industrial land and will prepare detailed marketing
plans for the proposed estates for review with the Bank by December 31,
1980. Since the estates are intended to create new employment opportunities,
priority in the allocation of sites and buildings will be given to new
enterprises, businesses moving from outside the province, and firms expand-
ing employment by at least 25%. Land will not be sold to firms relocating
within the province unless they meet the employment expansion criterion.
Priority will also be accorded to enterprises which are labor-intensive,
export-oriented, nonpolluting, and serve national rather than local markets.
In order to discourage speculation, purchasers will be required to initiate
construction within one year of purchase, and resales within five years after
purchase will be permitted only with prior authorization from the city govern-
ments.
3.10      Estate Management:  The Gwangju Industrial Estate will be located in
Gwangsan County. Gwangju City will be responsible for land and factory sales
and water supply, while Gwangsan County will handle the other aspects of
estate management. Although the county government currently lacks the staff,
equipment and experience necesssaiy to manage a large industrial estate,
development of such capability is not foreseen to be a problem. During the
first three years of the estate's operation Gwangju City will share responsi-
bility for recurrent management while the county expands its staff and acquires
additional equipment. The governments of both Gwangju and Mogpo will prepare
detailed estate management plans--specifying staffing and training needs,
equipment, budgetary requirements, and sources of funds--for review with the
Bank by December 31, 1980.
Housing Estates in Mogpo and Gwangju
3.11      Public Housing in Surrounding Areas:  The housing project in Gwangju
and Mogpo will initiate residential development of substantial area in the
vicinity of the project sites. Financing to improve and extend the existing
road to open these areas for development is included in the project. In Mogpo,
the northern extension area has already been designated primarily for residen-
tial development in Mogpo's master plan, a road network plan has been prepared,
and the prices of land in the North Port area are being frozen. The city in-
tends to expand the proposed project in the future to provide more low-income
housing. In Gwangju, the proposed access road to the housing and industrial
estates will stimulate development of a residential corridor in the northwest-
erly direction. At negotiations assurances were obtained that (a) in Mogpo,



- 21 -
at least half of any other future housing developments within the North Port
area designated as residential and (b) in Gwangju, at least one third of
residential areas to be developed in the vicinity of the new access road
will be used for housing affordable by households in the lower half of the
income distribution of the respective city.
3.12      Allocation of Housing:  Primarily because only salary and wages
earned by household heads were considered in the application process, a sub-
stantial proportion of the households allotted housing in the first regional
project had incomes higher than the target for the client group. In the
proposed project the screening process will be broadened to iinclude all house-
hold members and other income sources as well as salaries and wages. The
allocation criteria will define the eligible income range for the two types
of housing units proposed (para 6.16). The household income eligibility range
will be the current equivalent of W 80,000 to 110,000 per month for the 9-py
units and W 106,000-125,000 per month for the 12-py units in 1979 2nd quarter
prices which represents approximately 25-45 and 40-55 percentile respectively
of the urban income distribution in JNP.  Criteria for allocation of housing
was agreed during negotiations.
Yeosu Commercial Road: Relocation of Displaced Families and Factories
3.13      Construction of the Commercial Road will require demolition of
91 residential buildings and factories with about 3,100 sq m of floor space.
Yeosu City intends to help families and enterprises displaced by the project
find alternative accommodation as well as to pay compensation in accord with
Korean laws. Families displaced from their residences will be given priority
in the allocation of units in the proposed housing project and KNHC projects
if they satisfy the schemes' eligibility criteria, and displaced industries
will be given priority in the allocation of sites in the industrial zone
adjacent to the Fishery Harbor Complex financed under the first regional
project. Assurance was obtained dur.ing negotiations to this effect.
Dolsan Bridge: Urban Development Plan for Dolsan Island
3.14      Part of the justification for the Dolsan Bridge is that it will
facilitate expansion of Yeosu City onto the island. Steps to plan the urban
development of the island have already been initiated. Land prices on the
part of the island adjacent to the city have been frozen; this area is being
surveyed, and consultants have been engaged to prepare an urban development
plan. The planned area will be sufficient to accommodate about 50,000 people,
which would represent about half of the city's population growth during the
next 15 years at current growth rates. It is the Government's intention to
transfer administrative responsibility for this area from Yeocheon County to
Yeosu City. It was confirmed during negotiations that Yeosu City will review
the urban development plan for Dolsan Island with the Bank before its final
approval.
Mogpo and Yeosu Water Projects: Management of Water Bureaus
3.15      Several recommendations for improving the operations and maintenance
of urban water supply systems in JNP made in a study financed under the first
regional project will be implemented through technical assistance in the



- 22 -
proposed project (para 5.07). Consultants will be hired to train staff
in accrual accounting methods for the cities' Water Bureaus and assist in
installation of the new systems. Training will be provided to enhance the
skills of laboratory technicians and plant operators. The consultants prepar-
ing the detailed designs have been asked to initiate leakage control programs
by identifying major leaks in transmission mains; the program will be extended
to the distribution network through the technical assistance component of the
proposed project.
Mogpo Water Supply Project: Design and Maintenance of Daedong Dam
3.16      The project includes completion of a 19.4 m high clay-core rockfill
dam to create a 9.1 million cu m reservoir at Daedong. The upstream coffer
dam, dam foundation, spillway and intake structure have already been con-
structed (para 2.10). The dam was designed by local consultants for the
city government in 1972. The type and size of the dam proposed at Daedong
is common in Korea. The detailed design consultants will review and update
the dam's design as necessary. This arrangement is considered satisfactory.
To ensure the safety of the Daedong Dam, it was agreed during negotiations
that MOC would, under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank, have the dam
inspected periodically to determine whether there are any deficiencies in
the structure's condition or in operation and maintenance procedures which
may endanger its safety. To this end, GRCO and Mogpo city shall propose
appropriate arrangements for the Bank's review no later than December 1980.
Shrimp Storage Project: Separate Account; Project Management
3.17      The Shinan County Fisheries Cooperative Association is not a strong
financial entity, with average capital per member of only US$47. However, it
has managed its marketing activities satisfactorily, and the shrimp storage
project is a well-defined business operation which can be run independently of
the cooperative's other activities. Assurance was otained during negotiations
that a separate account will be established for the shrimp storage and market-
ing operation, and a full-time, resident Project Manager whose qualifications
and experience will be subject to Bank review will be appointed to be paid by
the Association.
Aquaculture Development Project
3.18      NFFC Credit Operation:  The credit program would be administered
by the NFFC Provincial Branch Office in Gwangju. For efficient management
and coordination between the project's credit and technical service com-
ponents and for full-time follow-up activities, the NFFC would appoint a
suitably qualified project coordinator to the branch office. The Coordina-
tor's qualifications and experience would be subject to Bank review. Loans
will be made to individual farmers for financing the purchase of the primary
production units (net units) and to the regional coopertives for the estab-
lishment of the processing and net freezing facilities. Loan applications
by the individual farmers for the purchase of net units would be evaluated
by the loan officer attached to the regional cooperatives as well as by the



- 23
Fisheries Promotion Office in Mogpo or Yeosu to determine technical feas-
ibility. The final approval of the individual loans would be made by NFFC's
Provincial Branch Office in Gwangju. The application by the farmer would be
supported with a recommendation from the village cooperative and two satis-
factory guarantors.
3.19      Loan application by regional cooperatives for financing of the
processing and seed production facilities, will be evaluated by the Project
Coordinator at the NFFC Provincial branch office in Gwangju,, assisted by the
Fisheries Promotion Office in Mogpo or Yeosu on technical matters. Based on
the recommendation of the Project Coordinator the final approval of the loans
will be made by the executive vice president at the NFFC's head office in
Seoul. The administrative arrangements for the credit schemes were confirmed
during loan negotiations.
3.20      Staffing of Fisheries Promotion Scheme:  The Yeosui and Mogpo
branches of the Fisheries Promotion Office employ 14 researchers and 35 exten-
sion workers. At the Yeosu office only 15 extension workers are presently
available to service nearly 295 village cooperatives having 25,527 households.
This office would be strengthened by a further 20 extension agents. Although
the Mogpo Promotion Office is adequately staffed, only 2 of its 20 extention
agents work directly with laver farmers. To implement the proposed project,
15 extension agents would be detailed to work exclusively to assist laver
farmers. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the staff of Mogpo
and Yeosu Fisheries Promotion Offices will be strengthened and that an adequate
number of extension workers will be assigned to project related operations.
IV. DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS
4.01      Feasibility studies and preliminary engineering for various sub-
projects were undertaken by consultants 1/ as a part of technical assistance
in the first regional project. Significant changes were made in the site
plans, design standards and specifications and in some cases, in the scale and
location of subprojects during the review process, resulting in substantial
cost savings. The design standards and general specifications for each sub-
project are summarized in Annex 1, Tables 1-8. Important design features
or issues for various subprojects are briefly described in the following
paragraphs.
Housing Estates at Gwangju, Mogpo and Yeosu
4.02      The housing estates are designed for mixed residential development
of low and middle-income families. Nearly 25% of the plots will be sold to
middle-income families at market prices to cross subsidize the low-income
1/   Arthur Young and Company in association with Louis Berger International
and Korea Engineering Consultants Corporation.



- 24 -
groups. The proposed site plans are consistent with the overall master plan
for each city and provide for future expansion. Economy in infrastructure
construction is achieved through appropriate utilization of existing topo-
graphy. The site plan is adapted to the hilly terrain to minimize costs and
maintain good views from elevated locations. The Mogpo site is flat but low
and would require 1.5-2.0 m landfill. The site plan extends the existing
street pattern and opens a vast new area for future residential development.
The Yeosu site is gently sloping with good drainage and is well suited for
development. The site plan reflects the high value of land along the main
road and planned expansion of housing site to the southwest.
4.03      The plot sizes and configurations are based on functional require-
ments and local preferences. Plots of 50 py and 70 py for middle-income
families will be sold as open plots. Plots for the low-income group will
be 27 py and 30 py in equal proportion, with 9 and 12 py expandable core
houses, respectively. The 9 py core house is designed for families at about
the 25th percentile of the household income distribution of the project cities
and will consist of 2 rooms, a toilet and a kitchen (Exhibit 1). This unit
will be expandable to 16.2 py on the ground floor corresponding to maximum
permissible coverage of 60%; further expansion on the second floor will also
be possible in one prototype design. The 12 py core, designed for families at
about the 45th percentile of the income distribution, will be expandable to 18
py on the ground floor with provision for second story development. The house
designs were evolved after an evaluation of the housing component of the first
regional project, in which all changes made or planned by the residents and
their views on the house design were studied. The significant features of the
proposed design are: the toilet is located outside the habited core; circula-
tion space within rooms is eliminated and the second room is located for
possible rental purposes.
Industrial Estates at Gwangju and Mogpo
4.04      The main criteria in the design of industrial estates has been to
achieve economies through appropriate planning and design standards. The
proposed site plans have high portions of saleable land (about 81% in each
case). A hierarchy of primary, secondary, and tertiary roads will provide
adequate circulation. Surface drainage will be separated from sewage/waste
water and will be in the form of open channels. Each factory will be respon-
sible for treatment of waste water on site according to specified standards.
A network of RCC pipes laid along the roads will collect the pretreated
effluent and discharge it into nearby drainage channels. The plan for the
fairly hilly Hanam site in Gwangju utilizes the existing topography to the
extent possible, and cut and fill will be approximately balanced to minimize
costs. The Mogpo site is located in a reclaimed area and will require about
2 m of land fill.
Mogpo Water Supply
4.05      Engineering designs for some of the civil works were completed
as part of an earlier city project. The design consultants will revise and
update these design documents, where they already exist and are appropriate



- :25 -
to the proposed project. Additional features of the proposed project are a
leakage detection and control program, and planning for a future intake struc-
ture tapping the Yong San estuary reservoir. This reservoir, to be created
near Mogpo by the Yong San Dam Project, will be the likely source of water for
Mogpo city in the 1990's, once it is desalinated. The design consultants are
to select the appropriate location of the intake structure and study the need
for constructing its underwater portion before the reservoir is impounded.
Yeosu Commercial Road
4.06      The road alignment and pavement width have been the main design
issues concerning the Yeosu road.  Land acquisition costs including compensa-
tion for existing structures are high, amounting to 66% of the total cost.
Three alternative alignments of the road in the vicinity of the existing
fishery port were investigated to achieve an economical design. The options
considered were to construct the road on: existing land (involving substantial
demolition), land reclaimed from the sea, and a combination of the two.
Seawall construction to reclaim land was found to be expensive. In the end,
the road alignment was adjusted to minimize demolition of existing structures,
but essentially kept on existing grouad.
4.07      The proposed road will have a 13 m pavement for 4 lanes.  Traffic
projections indicate it would be sufficient to construct two lanes initially
and add two lanes about five years later. However, site and cost considera-
tions justify initial construction of all four lanes. The savings achieved
by constructing only two-lane pavement amount to only 5% of the project cost.
Because of the topography and soil conditions of the area, serious drainage
and erosion problems are envisaged if space for additional lanes is left
unpaved.
Dolsan and Jindo Bridges
4.08      The location and alignment of the two bridges were selected after
investigation of various alternatives. A cable-stayed bridge is planned for
Jindo because of unfavorable foundation conditions in the channel. At Dolsan,
a more economical continuous box girder bridge, for which suitable foundation
conditions exist, is planned.
Imja Shrimp Storage Facility
4.09      The main design issue concerning the storage facility was whether to
construct a refrigerated storage building or a traditional facility consisting
of a series of tunnels. The refrigerated storage building has a slightly lower
capital cost but requires substantially higher operation and maintenance costs.
The tunnels, on the other hand, require negligible operating and maintenance
costs and are very reliable since no refrigeration equipment is involved.
Furthermore, this involves an accepted shrimp storage technique widely used
in Korea. The tunnel design was therefore considered appropriate.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementation Schedule
5.01      The project would be implemented during a five-year period (1979-
1983). A project implementation schedule is shown in Chart V-1. The Mogpo
water supply project is given top priority in implementation because of severe
water shortages. Construction of this project is expected to begin around
January 1980. Gwangju industrial and housing estates are given low priority
because they are dependent on improvements to the city's water system.
B. Procurement
5.02      The civil works will be divided into about 15 contracts.  Most sub-
projects will be covered under one contract, except for the housing and indus-
trial estate projects in Mogpo where it would be appropriate to have separate
contracts for landfilling. The contracts will range in value from US$0.2 mil-
lion to about US$25 million. All contracts will be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding to prequalified contractors in accordance
with the Bank guidelines. However, the local construction industry in Korea
is well advanced, and all contracts in this project are expected to go to
Korean firms. Contracts for aquaculture processing facilities totalling
about US$0.8 million will be let according to competitive bidding locally
advertized because of small buildings involved and their scattered locations.
Processing equipment for the aquaculture program will be procured through the
Office of Supplies (OSROK). Technical services for water supply and regional
planning will require some equipment (aggregate value US$200,000) which will
be procured through prudent shopping.
C. Disbursement
5.03      Disbursements from the proposed loan would be made for 44% of the
cost of civil works, 44% of loans disbursed by NFFC, 100% of cost for equip-
ment and overseas training and 60% of expenditures for technical services,
including consultancy services and studies. Disbursements for all items would
be made against standard Bank documentation except for loans disbursed by NFFC
which will be supported by a statement of expenditure for which supporting
documents would be retained by NFFC for review by Bank Supervision missions.
It is expected that Bank disbursements would be completed by December 31, 1983.
The estimated quarterly disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 3. Any undis-
bursed funds at the closing date will be cancelled unless the Bank agrees to
their reallocation for additional project related expenditure.



- 27 -
D. Accounts and Audit
5.04      A separate project account would be maintained by GRCO.  As facil-
ities are turned over to participating agencies they would submit to MOC
annual financial reports on pertinent project components. Agreement was
reached during negotiations that GRCO and relevant implementing agencies will
(i) maintain separate accounting records for all project revenues and expendi-
tures, (ii) ensure adequate and timely working capital is provided to finance
the project, and (iii) have the project accounts audited annually by an inde-
pendent auditor acceptable to the Bank and audit report submitted to the Bank
not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. Experience with
accounts and audits on the first project (Loan 1070-KO) has been satisfactory.
E. Supervision
5.05      Supervision of the project on behalf of the govermnent will be the
responsibility of GRCO, which is expected to hire consultants to supervise
construction. Because of the diverse and complicated nature of the project,
heavy Bank staff input would be required, particularly during the first year
when designs and contract documents are to be reviewed. It is estimated that
supervision by the Bank staff would require approximately 40 staff-weeks
during the first year and 20 staff-weeks annually during subsequent years.
For every staff-week in the field, approximately two staff-weeks of office
work in Washington would be required.
F. Technical Assistance
5.06      Technical assistance under this project would consist of: assistance
to secondary cities in improvement of water supply operations and management;
extension services in aquaculture development; a study of development poten-
tials of islands in JNP; preparation of a third regional project; develop-
ment of regional planning capabilities and monitoring and evaluation of
housing, industrial estate and aquaculture credit schemes. These needs will
be addressed through the provision of consultancy services and training of
local staff as discussed in the following paragraphs. Annex 4 summarizes
estimated costs for the technical assistance program.
Technical Assistance in Water Bureau Operations, Administration and Management
5.07      The project will include training for Water Bureau staff from Mogpo
and Yeosu and other municipalities in JNP in certain areas of management and
operations in which problems common to these--and most other---cities in the
region have been identified. The specific functional areas ito be addressed
are:
(a) Assistance in Designing and Installing Accrual Accounting
Systems: The ability of Water Bureau supervisors to



- 28 -
manage physical and financial resources effectively has
been severely constrained by the municipal bookkeeping
methods traditionally used in the country. More modern
accounting practices are needed to permit meaningful
financial planning and control of day-to-day operations.
The Provincial Public Utility Law mandates that modern
accounting systems be adopted by water utilities in
all major Korean cities. Studies financed by technical
assistance in the first regional project identified man-
agement improvements for JNP's four city water bureaus
and determined the need for training of bureau staff in
the practical application of the recommended systems.
It has been agreed that the training will be conducted
with the participation of specialist consultants under
the supervision of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
(b) Training of Treatment Plant Operators and Laboratory
Technicians. Studies in the first project confirmed that
there is appreciable scope for reducing operating costs
and increasing production from the existing treatment
plants in the region through more careful operational
control based on analytical monitoring of raw water and
plant processes. None of the plants have laboratory
equipment or staff skills sufficient for optimum cost-
effectiveness in production control on the scale involved.
The former deficiencies will in large measure be remedied
through the capital works part of the project. Training
of staff in modern instruments, procedures and process
control will improve production quality and quantity in
the existing facilities as well as the works to be con-
structed in this project. The training will be conducted
with the assistance of local and expatriate expertise in
the various disciplines involved at one central location
in the region.
(c) Training in Control of Water Losses. Establishment of a
continuing program of locating and reducing water losses
is an important element of the water supply projects. The
requisite leakage detection, flow measurement and pressure
recording instruments will be furnished as part of the
project. The bureaus need to establish operating units
responsible for identifying and controlling leaks, meter
under-registration and other sources of losses in water
accountability. Present water losses are very high in all
major cities in the region. Cutting losses by one third
or more in the near-term future is a realistic goal in
these systems if the proposed control effort is mounted
and sustained. It is proposed to train selected bureau
staff in planning and implementing a loss control program,
including field use of leak detection equipment and interpre-
tation of the data collected.



- 29 -
Technical Services in Aquaculture Development
5.08      The technical assistance component will be directed to improving
the extension services available to both laver and shell-fish farmers and
upgrading the teaching and demonstration techniques of laver production and
processing. The technical assistance component would encompass the following
activities:
(a)  15 fellowships of 3 months duration each, 8 for training
in Japan in the operation and maintenance of laver pro-
cessing equipment and 7 for courses in shellfish hatchery
methods in the US and Europe;
4              (b)  provision of laboratory and field equipment for the Mogpo
and Yeosu branches of the Fisheries Promotion Off'ice to
improve extension services to laver farmers particularly
in locating farm sites and to improve the field sampling
program for arc shell larvae. The equipment includes
light meters, saling meters, spectrophotometers, current
meters, microscopes, plankton nets and ph meters; and
(c)  demonstration equipment for Wando Fisheries High School to
be used for teaching laver culture production and processing
techniques. About 200 students are expected to benefit every
year.
Island Development Study
5.09      The JNP provincial government has decided to focus more attention
on the economic problems of the island populace. An officer responsible
for island development has been appointed to the Office of Planning and
Budget Management, and a 3-year island development plan is being prepared.
US$200,000 are being provided for an Island Development Study to support
these planning efforts. The assistance will be used (a) tco reveiw the eco-
nomic prospects of the province's ma:Ln islands and develop a strategy within
which proposed investments can be evaluated and (b) to identify investments
in transport, infrastructure and tourist facilities to develop the Narodo
Islands which has already been ident:ified as a priority area. The funds
for this assistance will be passd to the provincial government as a
budgetary grant.
Preparation of Third Regional Project and Development of Regional Planning
Capabilities
5.10      The Government intends to undertake similar regional development
projects in other parts of the country; Bank financing for a third regional
project is also envisaged. MOC has selected Jeonju region (primarily Jeonra
Bug Province) as the location for the third regional project.  A detailed
study of Jeonra Bug Province's development has already been completed by a
Korean university group. The provincial government has identified a series
of projects for the Iri-Jeonju-Goonsan area similar to the project included
in first and second Gwangju projects.



- 30 -
5.11      A provision of US$4.0 million is made for feasibility studies and
engineering designs for the proposed third regional project. The National
Physical Planning Bureau in MOC will have overall responsibility for project
preparation in consultation with relevant provincial and local agencies.
The recently established Korea Research Institute on Human Settlemnts (KRIHS)
will coordinate and supervise the feasibility studies to be undertaken by
consultants. Project preparation funds will be passed to MOC as a budgetary
allocation.
5.12      Part of the funds in this category will be used to strengthen MOC's
regional planning capability. They will be used for fellowships and study
trips for ministerial staff and for equipment and advisers for KRIHS.
G. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.13      Because of the Government's interest in undertaking regional devel-
opment projects in other regions, special efforts will be made to monitor
and evaluate the largest and most innovative components of the proposed
project. The monitoring exercise will focus on the housing, industrial estate
and aquaculture credit projects. As in the first project, local university
groups with some expatriate assistance in formulation of the program will be
responsible for monitoring of the project. MOC will periodically monitor
the traffic on the two bridges. A provisional sum of US$0.275 million is
allocated for this study.
5.14      The monitoring and evaluation study will, inter alia, focus on the
following issues:
(a) Housing Estates: selection criteria and procedures;
affordability analysis; suitability of site plans and
house designs; modes and nature of house expansion;
and residents' attitudes to the project.
(b) Industrial Estates: characteristics of industries on
site; investment behavior of entrepreneurs; employment
creation and characteristics of employees; and linkages
to off-estate industries.
(c) Aguaculture Loans: characteristic of borrowers; size
and type of facilities borrowed for; effectiveness and
cost of administrative procedures; and financial per-
formance of loan programs.

VI. FINANICIAL ANALYSIS
A. Cosit Recovery
6.01      The general approaches to cost recovery proposed for the different
project categories are summarized be-Low and discussed in detail in the
following paragraphs.
Project                                          Approach
Housing Estates                     Sale prices will recover full land, on-site
development and house cost:s and an attribut-
able proportion of off-sit:e infrastructure.
Internal cross-subsidization will be used
to lower prices of low-income plots.
Industrial Estates                  Sales prices will recover full land, on-site
development and factory module costs and an
appropriate proportion of off-site infra-
structure and, if market conditions permit,
will include a profit margin.
Water Supply Projects               Project costs will be recovered through
water rates and periodic rate increases will
move the Water Bureaus in Mogpo, Yeosu and
Narodo toward financial self-sufficiency.
Shrimp Storage Facility             Full project development costs will be treated
as a loan (at 10.5% for 10 years) to the county
cooperative to be repaid from revenues. Part
of the profits will be distributed to partici-
pating members; approximately 10% of net annual
profits will be retained to finance other
capital projects.
Aquaculture Project                 Loans will be made on the same terms as
other NFFC loans in this sector (currently
10.5% for 4-10 years). The technical services
will be financed through Government budgetary
allocations.
Bridges and Commercial Road         Costs would be recovered through vehicle user
charges and general,revenues.
Housing Estates
6.02      The actual cost of land acquisition, site preparation, on-site
infrastructure, core housing, desigrL and supervision and an appropriate
proportion of off-site infrastructure at the three sites in Gwangju, Mlogpo and
Yeosu will be directly recovered by the respective cities from the benefi-
ciaries through plot sales and mortgage payments. Mortgages will be issued
upon receipt of a 30% down payment for the low-income residential plots, with
the balance to be paid over 25 years; at 16.5% annual interest rate. A 30%



- 32 -
down payment is not considered high in the Korean context where the 'key
money' rental system forces everybody to save a substantial amount to acquire
even a modest rental space. In order to reduce the initial payment burden,
low-income families may opt for an escalating mortgage plan with payments
increasing by 5% every year during the first 10 years. The repayment period
of 25 years reflects the minimum expected life of infrastructure and core
housing, and the interest rate of 16.5% corresponds to the current lending
rate for mortgages and house construction by the Korea Housing Bank.
6.03      The commercial and middle income residential plots would be sold
through competitive bidding.  For those beneficiaries not desiring to purchase
the serviced plots on a cash basis, mortgages will be available with a 50%
down payment, and the balance to be repaid in equal installments over a
10-year period with 16.5% interest. The middle-income households are expected
to arrange their own financing for house construction.
6.04      Operation and maintenance costs of the roads, drains and water
supply at the sites to be carried out by the respective cities will be
indirectly recovered through taxes and other user charges. The costs of
garbage collection services to be provided by the cities will be directly
recovered through charges to the residents based on services rendered.
6.05      The spread of about 8% in the interest rate at which the central
government passes on the proceeds of the Bank loan to the cities and the
rate at which the cities recover costs from the beneficiaries will create
surpluses to the cities which will be allocated toward site administration,
interest during construction, default expenses and land purchase for future
projects. Rules governing the use of these surpluses will be agreed between
the Bank and the cities by December 1980.
6.06      Financing for the cost of the housing component not provided from
the proceeds of the Bank loan and the cities' own resources (about 12% of
total cost) would be made available by the Korea Housing Bank. Due to the
high interest charge on funds provided by the KHB, the cities will use all
down payments, advance payments and cash.sales as received from the purchasers
of the lots to repay KHB. The residents will make mortgage payments at
branch offices of KHB, which are located conveniently near the sites. It is
envisaged that KHB will pass on that portion of the Bank loan recovered
through monthly payments directly to the Government. The profits of sales
will then be turned over to the respective cities.



- 33 -
6.07       The cost of land and infrastructure development will be allocated
to residential/commercial beneficiaries, community facilities and parks in
proportion of the areas in respective land uses. The chargeable development
costs for the three sites are given below:

/1   W 248 million represents 30% of the total cost of the access road and
water connection.  The access road and water main will have many other
users since the road will open up the North Port area.
/2   W42 million represents 50% of the total cost of the access road, which
will open up new residential areas.
These costs are appropriated to various users as follows:

6.08       The middle-income plots and commercial land at the three sites
would be sold at market prices, which is likely to produce a surplus to
be used to lower the serviced land charges to the low-income families.
Actual sales prices of low-income plots will be determined on the basis
of actual construction costs and sal]es prices of larger plots. During
negotiations, it was confirmed that all profits gained through sale of
middle-income residential and commercial plots will be used to lower the
sales price of low-income plots. The marketable areas and sale prices
estimated for the three sites are shown below (June 79 prices):

6.09      The costs of part of off-site infrastructure not charged to the
residents in Mogpo and Yeosu and parks and play areas at the three sites would
be financed from the city governments' general revenues. Play areas would be
maintained by the communities. Serviced areas for community facilities will
be sold to the Ministry of Education at actual development cost. The total
cost of off-site infrastructure in Gwangju is attributed to the industrial
estate which will be the prime user of the facilities.
Industrial Estates
6.10      The full cost of development of the industrial estates in Gwangju
and Mogpo plus an element of profit, if feasible, will be recovered from
the entrepreneurs through plot sales at prices reflecting market values. In
addition, factory buildings will be constructed on about 7.5% of the plots
for sale to small entrepreneurs who might not otherwise be able to locate on
the estates. It is envisaged that about 20% of the developed land will be
sold on a cash basis and the remaining 80% on an installment basis, requiring
a 40% down payment with the balance to be repaid on a monthly basis for 3
years at 16% interest. The plots containing factory buildings will be sold
on an installment basis, with a 40% down payment and the balance to be repaid
monthly over 10 years at 16% interest.
6.11      Operation and maintenance of the water supply, roads and drains
will be recovered through water charges and through property taxes for which
purchasers are granted an eight year moratorium under the Korea's Industrial
Promotion Laws. Administration of the estates will be handled by an estate



- 35 -
management office housed in an administrative complex on each site. Recurrent
costs of the office will be financed from the surplus generated by the spread
in interest rates to the cities, as will the maintenance costs of the roads
and drains in the first eight years.
6.12      Funds for the costs of the industrial estates not provided by
the Bank loan would be available from several sources. The cities would
provide for the costs of land acquisition and promotional expenses during the
first year. The central government would make grant funds available for costs
of all off-site infrastructure and design and supervision in accordance with
government policy. Advance sales revenues would provide the balance of the
funds requirement for each of the two sites and would be used for debt
servicing, local costs of estate and factory construction and working capital
requirements.
Mogpo and Yeosu Water Supply Systems
6.13      Project costs will be recovered over time through water charges.
In recent years revenues have not been sufficient to recover operating costs
and debt service, and the utilities' accounting practices are inadequate
(para 5.07).  Until effective accounting systems can be constructed as part
of the project, including determination  and valuation of assets, assurances
were obtained that each Water Bureau will enter into a suitable cash genera-
tion covenant including, inter alia, increasing water charges by an average
of not less than 5% in real terms plus an allowance for inflation in each year
until the financial soundness of each bureau can be established.  Recently,
Mogpo raised the average rate in the city from W 85 to W 110 per mt, while
Yeosu increased the water rates by 25%. 1/ The stipulated rate increase of
5% per year in real terms coupled with the 1979 rate increases should enable
Mogpo and Yeosu Water Bureaus to achieve financial viability within 3 to 5
years.
6.14      In the case of Mogpo water supply the provincial government has
agreed to gradually increase the bulk water rate to enroute communities
served by the Mogpo system such that these communities will pay the full
cost of delivered water. Assurances to this effect were obtained during
negotiations.
Inflation and Interest Rates to Beneficiaries
6.15      After peaking in 1974-75, the inflation rate in Korea fell to
16% in 1976, 14% in 1977 and 13% in 1978. The Government has accorded very
high priority to controlling inflation, and average annual rates on the
order of 8-10% are expected during the next few years. Interest rates
to sub-borrowers are therefore expected to positive in real terms for all
projects.
1/   Actual increases may be higher th,an these; details are not yet avail-
able.

/5   Including estimated charges for water, electricity, garbage removal

/6   Assuming 25% of total household income devoted to housing.
6.17      A common practice in Korea is for more than one household to share
a house in order to afford the high housing costs (para 1.09). Current
investigation as well as extensive housing surveys carried out in the region
in 1973 and 1974 confirm this practice. The core houses will be designed to
provide a room acceptable for rental, which would provide an additional
income of W 8,000-10,000 per month to the owners.
6.18      About 39% of the units in the project would consist of the cheapest
option (9 py core house on a 27 py plot) with a total monthly burden of
about '4 20,725. Assuming that 25% of household income is devoted to housing,
these units are affordable by families falling roughly at the 25th percentile
on the household income curve for JNP (Annex 5). Similarly, the 12 pyong core
option is affordable by households at the 46th percentile. The 9-py core



- 37 -
house priced at W 3.4 million (US$6,960) is substantially cheaper than any
housing available through public or private programs. Most of public sector
housing for low-income families consists of 13-15 walk-up apartments; the
13 py apartment currently priced upward of W 6.1 million (US$12,600). The
attractive features of the units in the proposed project are the expansion
possibilities of the house and individual plots which conforms to Korean
traditions. The acceptability of the approach was clearly demonstrated in
the first project.
Water Supply
6.19      The ability of the urban poor in Mogpo to afford municipal water can
be assessed by examining the impact of the envisioned rates on families at the
20th percentile of income distribution, which currently represents a monthly
household income of about W 60,000. The available data suggest that the
average household in Mogpo pays between W 800 and 1,300 per month for water.
Although Mogpo's average rate is the highest in the country (and double that
in many other developing nations in Asia) and its average income is the
lowest, water costs account for only about 1.4 to 2.2% of disposable household
income.  Relevant experience elsewhere suggests that most domestic customers
are willing to pay up to about 4% of their income for reliable water service.
Water is expensive in Mogpo because of the city's distance irom practical
resources for meeting the near-term demands.
6.20      Assuming that the income growth for the target group is only 10%
annually, the monthly water bill affordable by a 20th percentile household
when the project enters service in 1981 will be about W 3,200. A dwelling
(containing 1.7 families on the average) of 8 persons will use about 25 cu m
per month at 105 lcd. The cross-subsidy factor for domestic customers is
presently about 0.8, with industry using only about 4% of the total billed
volume. By 1988, on the other hand, industrial users are projected to account
for about 10% of the billed volume, implying that the potential for cross-sub-
sidization of domestic users will increase as a result of tihe project. Even
with the present level of cross-subsidization, the typical domestic water bill
at the proposed 1981 average rate (W 110/cu m) would be about W 2,750 per
month which is below the imputed ability to pay, especially when the average
dwelling contains more than one household to contribute to the charges. The
5% annual rate increase proposed subsequent to 1981 is within reasonable
real-term income growth expectations.
6.21      The Yeosu water distribution project will extend service to approxi-
mately 35,000 people by 1985. Comparable examination of imputed ability to
pay at the proposed Yeosu rates indicates that families at the 20th percentile
of income distribution would be paying about 3% of disposable income for water.
C. Cash Flows
6.22      The following cash flows are presented in Annex 6, of this report.
The relevant operating statements, balance sheets and cash flows for other
subprojects are available in the project file.

VII. JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Economic Justification
7.01      The project's primary justification is its anticipated economic
impact on one of Korea's least developed regions. Project components have
been selected through a sieving process which began with broad regional
planning efforts and concluded with feasibility studies of specific components
identified in the earlier studies. In conjunction with other Bank and Govern-
ment-financed projects, the project will help achieve the objectives of
reducing regional income disparities and out-migration from JNP by providing
both rural and urban employment opportunities and by raising infrastructure
and service standards in the region's cities. The 18,000 jobs associated with
the industrial estate projects and the enhancement of the incomes of about
6,500 households in the fishery sector through the shrimp storage and aquacul-
ture projects will make significant direct contributions to achieving these
objectives, and the transport projects will integrate two large islands more
closely with the regional and national economies. The urban water supply
projects will help overcome critical constraints to expansion of Mogpo and
Yeosu, while the housing projects will address shelter needs not currently
met by public or private programs.
7.02      The results of separate economic analyses for various project
components except technical assistance are summarized below. The methodolo-
gies, quantitative flows, and benefits not quantified in these analyses
are documented in the Project File. The rate of returns were found to be
insensitive to standard conversion factors.  No adjustments were considered
necessary for labor wages due to the tight labor market in Korea. Shadow
prices for labor and foreign exchange were, therefore, not employed in the
analysis. All taxes and duties have been excluded. The estimated weighted
average economic rate of return for the project is about 23%. There are
interrelationships among groups of components which enhance the benefits
associated with the project as a whole. The most significant interrelation-
ships are between the water supply and the housing and industrial estate proj-
ects in Mogpo and Yeosu because the estates would be dependent on increased
water supply. Further, the full benefits of the Dolsan bridge would not be
achieved without extending water services to the island. Nevertheless, since
only a small portion of benefits from the water supply projects will accrue
to these other projects, separate rate of return analysis was performed for
each subproject.

B. Project Impact on Urban Poverty Population
7.03          An estimated 18% of the households in the three project cities have
incomes less than the urban poverty threshold (para 1.07). Nine of the
project's 13 components will be located in cities and benefit this poverty
population. The two industrial estates will accommodate about 18,000 workers;
it is estimated that 9,900 or 55% of the jobs will be for unskilled or semi-
skilled laborers drawn mainly from the poverty group. Although none of the
core housing units will be affordable for purchase by the poverty group, about
2,950 of the 3,950 plots to be supplied will have core units designed to
accommodate renters. It is estimated that these rooms will rent for an aver-
age of approximately W 8,000 a month; assuming 20% of income is devoted to
rental expenditure, these rooms would be affordable at about the 9th percen-
tile of JNP urban income distribution. Assuming that roughly half of the
rooms will be sublet, about 1,470 roomLs affordable on rental terms by the
poverty group would thus be supplied through the project.



- 40 -
7.04      The Mogpo and Yeosu Water Supply Projects will alleviate service
deficiencies which are most severe among the urban poor. The Mogpo project
will enable gradual reduction by about 50% of the number of people dependent
on water vendors by directly or indirectly serving about 9,500 people now
buying from vendors. Of the remaining 38,000 people to receive new service as
a result of the project, it is estimated that approximately two-thirds will
come from the poverty group. The project will thus directly serve roughly
28,500 members or 40% of Mogpo's urban poverty population. The Yeosu water
supply project is expected to provide service to about 4,800 families (24,000
persons) in the urban poverty group or about 65% of this group in the city in
1978. The Yeosu Commercial Road is a city-center road; its benefits should be
roughly proportionately distributed among the city's population, about 15% of
which is considered impoverished. The development of Dolsan Island facilitated
by the bridge and water supply components will entail new construction mostly
beyond the means of the poverty group, which will therefore benefit less than
proportionately. It is assumed below that 5% of its benefits will accrue to
the poverty group.
7.05      The 9 urban components account for 85% of total estimated project
costs. The project's urban poverty content is indicated in the following
table. Approximately 30% of project investment in the 3 cities and 25% of
total project investment can be considered urban poverty lending.

C. Project Risks
7.06      The most significant risk affecting all components is that construc-
tion prices may escalate faster than other costs. The impact of substantial
cost increases on the economic rates of return is assessed through sensitivity
tests in the economic analysis. The housing projects are particularly vulner-
able to construction cost increases since the least expensive units would no
longer be affordable by the target group. Although the demand for serviced



- 41 -
industrial land has been assessed carefully, the industrial estate projects
may experienc:e marketing difficulties due to locational factors and the policy
of charging market prices. The provision of installment terms for land and
factory purchases is intended to offset this risk. The Gwangju Industrial
Estate will be dependent in the long term on the planned expansion of
the city's water supply system, although other available resources may prove
to be sufficient for the early growth of the estate. The main, risk in the
water supply projects is that rates wilL not be increased sufficiently for
political or other reasons.  The full benefits of the Yeosu-Dolsan Bridge will
not be achieved if the urban developmentL of Dolsan Island is not properly
planned and controlled. Construction of the Jindo Bridge would be premature
if the connecting highways are not compLeted as planned. The main risk in the
Shrimp Storage Project is that many fis'hermen may be too bound to middlemen by
debt obligations to market their catch through the cooperative. The aqua-
culture component is small and novel for NFFC and will need careful coordina-
tion with the Fisheries Promotion Offices; unless sufficient appropriately
oriented staff are assigned to it and effective administrative procedures are
worked out, it may not develop as planned. Measures to reduce these risks
have been identified in the sections of the report concerning project manage-
ment and cost recovery.

4.  DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS
Site Preparation:
Gwangju             The steeply sloping site will require extensive cut and fill.  Cut/fill
will be minimized by site planning respecting the natural contours and
terracing. Maximum road gradients will be kept to 50%.
Mogpo               The site is a reclaimed area which will require approximately 2 m of
compacted fill.
Yeosu               The generally flat site will require minimal earthworks often not more
than clearing and grading.
Circulation:          The circulation will consist of a network of rcads and footpaths as follows:
Right of Way   Pavement   Sidewalk   Pavement Design
Primary             12            7           2       5 cm asphalt on 15 cm

Table 1 (continued)
Drainage:             Gwangju and Yeosu will utilize a combined system for storm water and
domestic waste water (or sullage) disposal. Mogpo will utilize surface
street drainage for 80% of the site. The on-site network will consist
of reinforced concrete spun pipes running alongside and parallel to road
network and including manholes and surface drainage inlets. Mogpo and
Yeosu sites have existing major drainage canals as one boundary of the
site. The Gwangju site is located between two rivers and has good
drainage away from the site.
Water Supply:         A total 1,900 mt is required to serve the three projects, based on 100 lcd
demand. Each site will be served by the city water supply system and will
feed to individual metered housed connections. Connections to the site
will serve other areas as in Gwangju, the Industrial Estate, and in Mogpo,
the built-up area along the transmission line.
Sewerage:             Gwangju and Yeosu disposes wastewater (sullage) into the enclosed storm-
water system. Mogpo disposes wastewater into an enclosed sewer pipe which
runs to the sea. All sites utilize septic tanks with effluent discharge
into the enclosed wastewater systems.
Electricity:          KECO (Korean Electric Company) will install and maintain transmission lines
and street lighting on concrete poles along the road alignment.
Community             Gwangju - Primary school of 35 classrooms, commercial center to serve the
Facilities:         site and surrounding areas, and police box and fire station of a limited
size; Mogpo, small commercial area; Yeosu, large commercial area. All
sites have playgrounds for children and large playfield areas for adoles-
cent type games.
Core Houses:          75% of the plots would be provided with core houses:
Number of Houses
Lot Size   Core Size   Expanded Size   Gwangju   Mogpo   Yeosu
27           9             16            730       438      385
30         12              18            657       394     346
Two types of units have been designed for each core size after an evaluation of the 1st Phase
housing projects. The nine py core provides two rooms plus a toilet and kitchen built with
an ondol-floor heating system. Designs include a one and two story scheme and flexibility to
allow one room to be rental.
Off-site Infrastructure:
Gwangju             The proposed access road for the Gwangju Industrial Estate will also serve
the housing estate. The housing estate will have good linkages to the new
industrial estate and the city center. The water main proposed along the
access road will serve both the housing and industrial estates.
Mogpo               A new access road 1.5 km long is proposed.  The road has a 25 m right of
way, but initially only half the width will be developed.  A 6.5 m pave-
ment, 3.0 m green strip and 2 m sidewalk if planned.  A 1.5 km water
main is also included to service the site.
Yeosu               All utilities are near the site.  Only about 300 m of road and a box
culvert would be needed.

4. DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS
Site Preparation /1
Gwangju            As the site steeply slopes, extensive cut/fill is required.  Cut/fill will be minimized by terracing
within elevation drop of less than 2 m. Filling will be achieved through, layers of not more than
30 cm compacted to 95% density (minimum) at optimum moisture content.
MOgpo              As the site is located on a reclaimed area, scarifying and removal of top layer would be required,
using appropriate fill material in layers of not more than 30 cm compacted to minimum of 95% density
at optimum moisture content, the site will be built up to the desired ground elevation.  The newly
filled site will be allowed to settle and stabilize prior to permanent construction.
/l The consultants will prepare comprehensive site preparation specifications identifying source and type of fill material,
removal of top layer and compaction criteria and ensure compliance with specifications during construction.

4.  DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS
Site Preparation    The site consists of rocky hills.  Tunnels will be constructed through
drilling. Blasting will not be feasible because of tunnel size and nature
of the rock.
Construction Work   The tunneling work will be done by drilling, using scaffolding structures
whenever needed.
Lining               The tunnels are to be lined with reinforced concrete using concrete pumped
under pressure.
Electricity          The electrical power for use at the project site is going to be either from
Source             the public distribution system or through an independent generating system.
Water Supply         No water supply shall be included as part of this project, as drinking
water from wells is available and does not pose any problem. Sea water is
to be used for washing shrimp at the shore.
Drainage             The tunnels will be constructed with outward floor slope at 1:50 for surface
drainage of the tunnels.
Jetty                A reinforced concrete Jetty is proposed.  The exact location of the jetty

These rates do not take into account the actual rate increases recently approved in 1979, which are higher than those
assumed in this analysis.

M Charge payable to Agriculture Development Corporation upon connection to Daecho system; W 12/cu m in 1979.
/5 Depreciation not provided until full accruals accounting in operation and assets valuation undertaken (para 5.07 (a)). If
operating costs are considered to be 1% of total capital assets, assets value end-1983 would be about Won 21,300 million.
Depreciation of 2.5% would be about Won 532 million, implying substantial operating deficits post-project period. Therefore
until fiscal position can be more accurately ascertained under the project, cash generation is the most important consideration,
hence the cash generation component.
