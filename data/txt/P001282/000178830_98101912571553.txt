I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
1.01      Public telecommunications services in Kenya are operated by two
corporations, the Kenya Posts and Telecommujnications Corporation (KPTC) and
the Kenya External Telecommunications Company, Limited (KENEXTEL). KPTC, an
autonomous government-owned entity under t-ie Ministry of Transport and
Communications, was created in 1977 follow[ng the break up of the East Africa
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (E APTC). KPTC is responsible for
the maintenance and operation of all local and national telecommunications
services, international telegraph and telex services, and the operation of
the international telephone services. KENIEXTEL is a state-owned company
responsible for the technical maintenance of the international automatic
telephone exchange (the manual exchange is maintained and operated by KPTC),
and an earth satellite station located near Nairobi.
1.02      As agreed under the first Kenya telecommunications project, the
operational relationship between KPTC and l(ENEXTEL was better defined in 1980
(paragraph 5.04). It is still not clear, however, that sector resources are
being allocated most effectively between these two agencies. For example,
while KPTC's staffing seems under control 'paragraph 4.04), KENEXTEL with 969
staff operating only an automatic gateway exchange and an earth station may
be overstaffed. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the
Government would carry out and complete, not later than July 1, 1983, a study
with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank to assess the organizational
and cost economies that may be gained by the consolidation of the
telecommunications sector, and that the Government shall within three months
upon completion of this study provide the Bank with a copy of the study, and
exchange views on the recommendations of the study.
1.03      The Ministry of Home Affairs and the Aerodromes Department manage
some telecommunications services in Kenya 1or their administrative and
operational needs. Private users can operate point-to-point services after
obtaining a license from KPTC. Licenses are issued on an annual basis in
situations in which KPTC is not in a position to provide such services. As
of end November 1981, there were 1,375 licensed private point-to-point
networks in operation: examples of licenses include the Kenya Pipeline Co.,
several oil companies, Kenya Breweries, a number of civil works and general
contractors, construction companies, national parks and safari lodges,
meteorological services, air charter companies, etc. As KPTC's
telecommunications network increases its spread and improves its reliability
during this project period, the number of private users should steadily
decrease as it will be less costly to use KPTC's facilities. Except for some
outside plant materials, there is no other telecommunications equipment
manufacture in the country.
Access to Service
1.04      As of January 1, 1980, Kenya's telephone density of 1.1 telephones
per 100 population was slightly above average compared with neighboring



East African countries.  Annex 1 sets out international telephone statistics
as of January 1, 1980. Existing telephone service as of January 1, 1982 is
concentrated in the Nairobi and Mombasa areas where the telephone density is
13.2 and 7.3 per 100 population respectively. Telephone density in the rest
of the country is approximately 0.3 telephones per 100 population. As of
January 1, 1982, there were 80,206 main lines in Kenya distributed as
follows:
Number of        Percentage of        Percentage of
Area                  Main Lines          Main Lines            Population
Nairobi                  41,709               52                    5.5
Rest of the Country    38,497                 48                   94.5
Total              80,206               100                  100.0
1.05      Population centers are classified for government administration
purposes as (a) principal towns with populations exceeding 19,000 and which
have separate local municipalities; (b) urban centers with populations of
2,000 and more and which are district administrative headquarters; (c) rural
centers with divisional administrative headquarters; and (d) market and local
centers which are the smallest administrative units. All ten principal
towns, 73 of the 86 urban centers, 62 of the 150 rural centers, 31 of the 420
market centers, and 18 of the 1,018 local centers have some telephone
facilities. Telegraph service is available generally to all centers except
local centers.
1.06      As of July 31, 1981, in Nairobi and Mombasa, about 56 percent and
70 percent respectively, of main lines were identifiable from KPTC listings
as being connected to business and government offices and the balance to
telephones listed under the names of individuals (see Annex 2 for more
complete data):

1.07      With regard to rural areas, two small manual exchanges, one in the
Coastal and one in the Eastern Province, were polled to identify the
occupations of the telephone subscribers. In the Eastern Province District
Headquarters town of Siakago the 23 telephcne subscribers were: 7
administrative offices, 3 shops, 3 schools, a tobacco company, government
health center, mission, court, postmaster, public call office and the houses
of the district officer, public health officer, a teacher, and a Kuna party
employee. In the Coastal Province town of Gongoni, the 20 subscribers in
Gongoni and the neighboring town of Mambrui were: 9 shopkeepers, 2
transporters, 2 public call offices, a saltworks factory, poultry farmer,
member of parliament and 4 residents, 3 of whom are employed in the larger
town of Malindi, ten miles distant.
1.08      In order to obtain a telephone connection, a potential subscriber
must register on a waiting list. Connections are made (subject to technical
feasibility, and availability of exchange and cable capacity) in the order in
which names appear on the waiting list, i.e., according to the date of
application.  As of January 1, 1982, the official waiting list which is
maintained only in those areas in which service currently exists, totals
about 64,100-37,000 in Nairobi, 5,400 in Mombasa, and 21,700 in the rest of
the country. Waiting times for telephone applicants in Nairobi range up to
four years depending on the exchange area.

Telephone Service Usage
1.09      Traffic generated in automatic exchange areas by business and
government subscribers accounts for about 90 percent of all traffic. As
business, government and residential connections used for business purposes
generate almost all traffic during the congested peak calling hours, they are
the primary determinants of system capacity costs. The importance of large
business and government users is also illustrated by the fact that about
73 percent of KPTC's telephone revenue is generated by only 20 percent of the
total number of connections. Annex 3 sets out the revenue distribution.
1.10      A recent sample of subscribers in small towns and market centers in
two districts in west and south-central Kenya provides information on which
sectors or types of activities make the most use of telephone service outside
the large urban centers. As can be seen from the following table, calling
rates in these areas are highest for the transport and storage sector,
probably because the two regions sampled contain mostly small towns and
market centers and are located a considerable distance from Nairobi. These
towns rely heavily on transport for the movement of supplies and goods.

1.11      When a sample of subscribers, applicants on the telephone waiting
lists, and public coin box telephone users in the two districts were asked to
list and describe their most important telephone contacts, the dominant
reasons noted were placing and receiving orders for goods, services, spare
parts, etc., giving or receiving information, and taking care of
administrative matters as seen in the table below:

1.12      The pattern of long distance traffic in Kenya reflects the fact
that Nairobi is the center of the national economy. More than 60 percent of
all traffic generated in the national network is directed towards Nairobi.
Sample tests indicate that in small communities over 50 percent of all calls
made are directed towards Nairobi, while in medium-sized towns almost
70 percent of the calls terminate in the capital.
Quality of Service and Existing Facilities
1.13      Lack of timely investment, caused largely by uncertainties prior to
the ultimate breakup of the East African Community (EAC) and the East African
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (EAPTC), and of proper planning in
the past have caused the telephone network to exhibit a number of
deficiencies, which have led to poor service. Partly because of a lack of
cable in major cities to provide additional connections, the high number of
telephones connected on each main line (an average of about 2.5) has
increased calling rates and has created considerable local network
congestion. This necessitates repeated attempts to complete calls during
peak business hours, which in turn causes more congestion.
1.14      Subscriber trunk dialing (STD) facilities for long distance calls
are available to subscribers connected through some local automatic exchanges
in the country: for other automatic exchange subscribers and for those
connected on manual exchanges in rural and semiurban areas, long distance
service is provided on a manual basis.  The long distance STD service is also
congested primarily because of (a) a shortage of long distance circuits
resulting in a high rate of ineffective calls; and (b) the repeat call
problem when trying to call into local networks, which during busy hours are
tied up due to high local usage.  The unsatisfactory long distance STD
service has resulted in the diversion of long distance traffic to manual



switchboards causing an overload on the existing manual switchboards and of
several hours' delay in setting up calls dtiring business hours. The overall
result of these network problems has been a large unsatisfied demand and
unsatisfactory service. Basic data on existing facilities as of December 31,
1980, and projections through 1986 are set out in Annex 4.
1.15      Access to international service is available through an earth
satellite station (paragraph 1.01), and through microwave radio, VHF radio
links or open wire system to neighboring countries.  The quality of service
through the earth satellite part of the network is good.
Demand for Service
1.16      Expressed demand for main lines cas of January 1, 1982, totaled
144,294 including 80,206 main lines in service and 64,088 outstanding
applications for new lines. Based on past long-term growth trends of
expressed demand, data obtained through a block-by-block survey in some
existing exchanges, and selected consultation with town planning and other
development authorities about future develcopment plans, KPTC has prepared a
demand forecast through 1986. KPTC forecasts that demand will total about
206,000 by end 1986--a 9 percent annual grcwth rate as against an 11 percent
growth rate between 1977-81. These forecasts are considered conservative.
However, since the increased supply will nct meet even these conservative
forecasts of demand during the project period, they are acceptable for
project purposes. The table below gives actual and KPTC's forecast levels of
aggregate expressed demand for and supply cf main lines year by year for the
period 1982-86.

1.17      During the past two years under the first Bank project, means to
improve demand forecasts, particularly outside of the larger cities, have
been examined. One study, partially supported by the Bank, examined the
hierarchal communication linkages within the two districts noted earlier
(paragraph 1.10) among principal towns, urban centers, rural centers, and
market centers. Such work will continue within KPTC's soon to be created
fundamental planning unit (paragraph 4.03).
1.18      By January 1, 1982 the telex service had 1,415 connections and 793
applicants on the waiting list. The demand for telex in towns where service
is not currently available is not quantified. However, KPTC expects total
demand in the country in 1986 to reach about 3,000--a 13 percent annual
growth rate over the current measure of expressed demand. This forecast is
reasonable.
Sector Goals
1.19      During the next ten-year long-term planning period, KPTC plans to
extend local services and high quality long distance services using the
latest available techniques, and to further concentrate on providing basic
telecommunications facilities to rural areas which are currently inadequately
served or without service. KPTC proposes under the proposed project to:
(a)  significantly improve the quality of local service and
expand the local Nairobi telephone network;
(b)  expand access to telephone service in rural areas by
increasing capacity of small rural exchanges, and opening
new public call offices in communities (rural, market and
local centers) currently without such facilities;
(c)  upgrade and expand the long distance network to handle
the additional forecast traffic;
(d)  expand telex services for business and government use;
and
(e)  improve KPTC's management procedures and financial
management capabilities.
1.20      For implementation of the above objectives, KPTC proposes to carry
out a FY82-86 development program (including the proposed project) which is
substantially larger than that which was achieved under previous plans. This
program is considered feasible and adequately reflects government development
priorities (paragraph 3.03).

Sector Constraints
1.22      The major constraints hampering progress in the telecommunications
sector have been inadequate investment, institutional deficiencies related to
a lack of continuous planning, and some shortage of trained technical staff.
Though the shortage of technical staff has been largely made up, KPTC is not
yet completely self-sufficient in local expertise.



- 10 -
1.23      The expansion of the sector has been, and still is, tied to KPTC's
capacity to generate funds from internal resources, and to borrow foreign
funds since KPTC is basically constrained to developing the sector without
either direct financial support from Government or significant borrowing.
The Bank's Role
1.24      The Bank has been associated since 1966 with the telecommunications
sector in the East African Community (EAC), which prior to 1977, was managed
by EAPTC. In February 1967, the Bank approved a US$13.0 million loan
(483-EA) to EAPTC to help finance a project designed to increase local and
long distance facilities. This project was satisfactorily completed in early
1974. A second loan (675-EA) for US$10.4 million was approved in 1970 to
finance a project to further extend the telecommunications services. This
project was satisfactorily completed in June 1975. The third loan (914-EA)
was approved in May 1973 for US$32.5 million to further extend
telecommunications facilities. Due to the problems in the EAC leading to its
breakup, the works to be undertaken on this third project were delayed. The
Kenya part of the project was, however, completed in early 1981.
1.25      The Operations Evaluation Department's combined report (No. 893 of
October 21, 1975) on the first two projects, while holding an overall
positive view of the Bank's achievements, points out the large delays in
project implementation caused by inadequate planning and project management,
problems in procurement, and the failure to meet demand for service. WYhile
the above three projects were managed by EAPTC, KPTC has shown that on its
own, it has the ability to execute a project over a reasonable time frame.
1.26      The first Kenya telecommunications project (Loan 1680-KE) which
became effective in August 1979 is fully committed and is proceeding
satisfactorily. Some initial procurement delays were experienced, but KPTC
is now conversant with Bank procurement procedures (paragraph 2.12). The
project is expected to be completed about one year behind schedule. Under
the proposed second telecommunications project, most remaining deficiencies
in planning and management are expected to be eliminated (paragraphs 4.03 and
4.12). Procurement of goods is well in hand (paragraph 2.12), and about 83
percent of the expressed demand is proposed to be met (paragraph 1.16).
1.27      The Bank's participation since 1966 through the three completed EAC
projects and the first Kenya project under execution has enabled Kenya to (a)
begin to establish a modern long distance telecommunications network with the
associated long distance exchanges to link the principal areas of the country
and to initiate the provision of a national subscriber dialing network
covering a number of the larger exchanges in the country; (b) expand the
local telephone service in Nairobi and in some of the larger towns in the
provinces; and (c) create a financial base and establish an institutional
framework for development and future expansion.
1.28      The Bank's role in this project is to assist KPTC in attaining the
objectives set out in paragraphs 1.19-1.21. While KPTC has made some



- 11 -
progress in the technical and planning areas, further strengthening of the
planning department is necessary (see paragraph 4.03), and the financial area
is still in need of attention (see paragrapIh 4.12). KPTC also needs to
improve in-house capabilities for the improvement of service quality, future
planning, demand forecasting and stores management (paragraphs 1.13 and
1.16). The Bank will assist KPTC's institu.;ion building efforts in the above
areas through close association in the financing and monitoring of the
project, and will continue to encourage KPTC in its major effort of providing
long distance facilities to an increasing number of rural communities
(paragraphs 1.19 and 3.10).
II. THE PROGRAM AN4D PROJECT
The Program
2.01      KPTC has drawn up (and the Governrient of Kenya has approved) a
five-year (1982-86) telecommunications development plan which comprises the
following main work items:
(a) ongoing works carried over from 1979 - installation of
about 24,000 additional local equLpment lines and the
connection of about 46,000 additional main lines; long
distance rural public call offices at 200 locations; and
installation of about 3,100 addit"onal long distance
lines, financed under Bank Loan 1680-KE; and
(b) installation of about 22,200 addil;ional local equipment
lines, financed with Japanese Government/supplier
credits;
(c)  preinvestment for extension of equipment being installed
under the 1982-86 program and which is planned for
completion by end 1986; and
(d) the project for Bank financing (pciragraph 2.03).
Of the ongoing works, all Bank-financed project works are scheduled to be
completed by June 1984; the Japanese credit works by mid 1983; and the
remaining works by end 1983. Given KPTC's implementation capacity and the
introduction of new techniques, the size of the program proposed to be
executed is considered to be about the level that KPTC can prudently
undertake.
2.02      The estimated direct cost of the program is about K Sh 2,220.1
million (US$222.0 million) with a foreign exchange expenditure of about
US$150.2 million equivalent. Annual program costs from 1982 through 1986 are
set out in Annex 6.

The Project
2.03      The project proposed for Bank financing is a high priority
self-contained part of KPTC's 1982-86 development program, provides for a
balanced and integrated facilities development, and will be carried out
between 1982 and 1986. The project comprises the installation of the
following:
(a) a total of about 80,900 additional lines of local
automatic exchange equipment with associated cables and
subscribers' plant to connect about 75,000 additional
main lines;
(b) a total of about 7,100 terminations in long distance
exchanges;
(c) three microwave radio systems and about 1,270 additional
channels;
(d)  rural carrier systems to provide about 200 additional
channels;
(e) two telex systems with a total of 3,000 additional lines
and connection of about 500 additional subscribers; and
(f) buildings to house project equipment.
Project Cost
2.04      The total direct cost of the project is estimated at about K Sh
1,229.5 million (US$123.0 million) with a foreign expenditure of about
US$69.6 million equivalent. The cost of the project, set out in detail in
Annex 6, is summarized as follows:

2.05       The project costs reflect estimated December 1980 prices based on
KPTC's experience with contracts relating to ongoing works and those signed
for goods under Loan 1680-KE, with adjustmeits for inflation to bring them up
to the projected early 1982 level. KPTC has provided for costs for training
its staff by consultants for procurement of digital exchanges; and for
training operation staff by the equipment slupplier of these exchanges for a
period of one year after commissioning them. KPTC will use about 69 manweeks
of consultants' (Crown Agents of the UK) se-vices provided on an intermittent
basis during the project period at an average cost of about US$3,600 per
manweek (including corporate overhead costs) for the work outlined in
paragraph 2.11 but excluding suppliers' payrients. The project estimates are
reasonable. KPTC is exempt from payment of customs duties on imported goods
and pays no taxes.



- 14 -
Contingencies
2.06      Price contingencies for project costs amount to 26 percent of total
base and physical contingency costs. They result from the year-by-year
estimates of local cost increases of 13 percent in 1982; 9 percent in 1983
and 8 percent annually from 1984 through 1986; and year-by-year estimate of
foreign costs increases of 8.0 percent in 1982 and 1983; 7.5 percent in
1984; 7.0 percent in 1985; and 6.0 percent in 1986. The foreign cost
increases are applied to the contract date since all contracts are made on a
fixed price basis and are likely to be signed by mid 1983, and most of the
equipment would be delivered by mid 1984. The foreign cost increases are in
line with the Bank's expectations, and the local cost increases are based on
KPTC's past experience and expectations.
2.07      Except for variations in quantities which could occur in civil
works and for which a physical contingency amounting to 5 percent of local
costs has been provided, no other physical contingencies are considered
necessary. Provision of local and long distance exchange lines, telephones,
microwave radio and multiplex channel equipment proposed to be procured and
installed under the project are based on detailed forecasts of equipment
quantities and detailed engineering. In view of this, the proposed total
quantities of equipment are not expected to change significantly, and
according to experience any unexpected increases of equipment on some routes
will be compensated by corresponding unexpected decreases on other routes.
In the case of cable networks, the dispersion of these networks throughout
the country permits flexibility and adjustments which make provision of
physical contingencies unnecessary.
Items and Sources of Financing
2.08      Of the project's direct and indirect foreign cost of about US$70.3
million (including US$0.7 as fee), the proposed Bank loan would provide about
US$44.7 million (US$44.0 million for the procurement of goods and services,
and US$0.7 million as fee). The balance of US$25.6 million would be provided
by external loans or grants contracted by KPTC. All the local funds (US$53.4
million equivalent) will be provided by KPTC. The items for Bank financing
in US$ million are as follows:

2.09      Equipment totaling US$38.1 million including contingencies would be
grouped in appropriate bidding packages ancl procured by international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Qualifying domestic
manufacturers would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent, or
the import duty, whichever is the lower. Switching equipment for extension
lines in eight different local exchanges, [rocured through international
competitive bids under Bank guidelines under Loan 1680-KE and currently being
installed, and estimated to cost about US$5.6 million, would be obtained for
purposes of standardization, full utilization of the space planned for such
extension in existing buildings, and economies resulting from the use of
existing common equipment, through negotiations with existing suppliers and
will be financed with Bank loan funds. The Bank will check on the
reasonability of these prices before approving disbursements. Goods such as
cable ducts and some external plant which are manufactured locally and which
would be financed by KPTC's own resources %ould be obtained through local
competitive bids. The local procurement system permits competition and is
satisfactory.
2.10      All bidding packages (six in total) for goods estimated to cost
over US$0.5 million equivalent would be subject to the Bank's prior review of
procurement documentation resulting in a coverage of about 99 percent of the
total estimated value of goods contracts. Five of the bid documents have
already been reviewed in the Bank. The contract relating to power plant as a
part of transmission equipment, would be su3ject to post review by the Bank
after contract award. KPTC has already selected Crown Agents as consultants
(paragraph 2.11) in accordance with Bank's guidelines (August 1981). This
contract will be reviewed in the Bank before it is signed.

Project Implementation
2.11      The proposed project execution schedule as set out in Annexes 7 and
8 is realistic. KPTC has prepared engineering designs for all equipment.
KPTC has in the last four operations (three as part of EAPTC and one as KPTC)
utilized the services of Crown Agents of UK as consultants for the
preparation of all bid documents, evaluation of bids, contract preparation,
and supplier payment before obtaining Bank loan reimbursements. KPTC pro-
poses in this project to carry out procurement of all Bank-financed goods,
except digital electronic exchanges, using its own staff, and for the new
electronic exchanges to retain the services of Crown Agents. KPTC has judged
the Crown Agents' performance on goods procurement under Loan 1680-KE as good
and has therefore utilized their services for this specific procurement.
These arrangements are satisfactory. KPTC would lay and commission all
distribution and interexchange cables, and would supervise the construction
of cable ducts by local contractors. All installation works would be carried
out by KPTC staff, except in the case of the new and sophisticated type of
electronic switching equipment where KPTC's staff would assist the
contractor's staff. KPTC would carry out acceptance tests on all installed
equipment. KPTC's management has the experience required for the execution
of the project. The project is expected to be completed by March 31, 1987.
Disbursements
2.12      The estimated schedule of Bank loan disbursements is set out at
Annex 9. The first telecommunications loan (1680-KE) was approved on
March 29, 1979. KPTC entrusted the Bank-financed procurement work to
consultants--Crown Agents of UK--on May 25, 1979. The delay in deciding on
the consultants for procurement work was due to high level administrative
problems within KPTC. Altogether, a total of six bids were invited between
December 1979 and June 1980--about one year after contracting of consultant
services--and contracts were signed from October 1980 to March 1981--a total
procurement period of 24 months from loan approval and 22 months after
retaining consultants. KPTC invited bids in November 1981 for all Bank-
financed goods, except exchanges, under this second project and has already
received offers on these bids. KPTC expects to invite bids for the exchanges
by June 30, 1982. All contracts are, therefore, likely to be signed by March
1983. Loan disbursements have been based roughly on the above schedule of
procurement with adjustments to more closely correspond to historic
disbursements in Kenya. Annex 9 also sets out the Bank's disbursement
profile based on East African Telecommunications (EAPTC) - a community which
ceased to exist as such in 1977 - operations covering the period FY70-80.
KPTC's performance is a distinct improvement on the ex EAPTC's operations,
and all Bank loan funds on the first Kenya telecommunications project have
already been committed.



- 17 -
Disbursements would be made for (a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and
80 percent of local expenditures for all goods specified for procurement
under the loan; and (b) 100 percent of foreign cost of consultants.  Where
necessary, disbursements would include the foreign cost of installation of
goods and of maintenance after installation of digital exchanges by
contractor staff assisting KPTC staff. AlL disbursements would be fully
documented.  The closing date of the loan Nould be September 30, 1987.
Performance Indicators
2.13       Indicators which will assist in inonitoring KPTC's project
implementation, and operational and financial performance are set out in
Annex 10. These indicators have been discussed with KPTC management and have
been agreed upon Loan negoatiations. KPTC will include these indicators in
the quarterly project reports sent to the !3ank for the period ending December
31 of each year.
IIl. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.01      The economic analysis relates primarily to KPTC's 1982-86
telecommunications investment program, of wvhich the Bank project is an
integral part.
Telecommunications and Development
3.02      Usage of the telephone service ir Kenya is dominated by business
and government administration and is heavy, with substantial waiting lists
and significant call traffic congestion (paragraphs 1.06 through 1.14).
Forecast demand is not expected to be met at the end of the project period in
1986 (paragraph 1.16).
3.03      Under the fourth (1978-82) develcipment plan, growth in the Kenyan
economy has been greatly aided by a concurrent growth in telecommunications
infrastructure. This has enabled a steady expansion of the agricultural base
of the economy, supported the government policy of dispersal of industry into             7
regions outside Nairobi, and encouraged the growth of tourism, Kenya's third
largest foreign exchange earner. As commercial, agricultural, and industrial
output continues to increase in Kenya, comirunications needs grow, and the
least cost means of communication for an ircreasing proportion of the urban
and rural population is some form of telecommunication services. KPTC's
1982-86 development program will continue the distribution of
telecommunications services to regions outside Nairobi, increase access in



- 18 -
the more isolated rural areas, expand system capacity, and upgrade the
quality of local, long distance and international telephone and telex
services.
Business Efficiency Gains
3.04      In Kenya, telephones and telex are primarily used as intermediate
inputs in the production of goods and services. A recent survey1 of nine
Kenyan firms located in Nairobi identified a wide range of ways in which
business performance will be enhanced as the Kenya telecommunications network
is improved and extended. Two of the firms surveyed are engaged in
manufacturing and processing (East Africa Industries, House of Manji), five
provide services or transport (Alliance Hotels, Industrial Distributer,
Interfreight, Pan African Travel, Standard Newspaper), and two are engaged in
agriculture/horticulture (Kenya Horticulture Export Corp., Kenya Nurseries).
The study documented telecommunications benefits specifically relating to
business expansion, sales price effects, purchase price effects, vehicle use,
production stoppages, distribution costs, labor time, and managerial time.
3.05      The study found that the single most important potential benefit to
the nine firms examined from expansion and improvement in the Kenyan
telephone service will come from an increase in sales made possible by better
buying and selling access to markets. The major part of the efficiency
benefits from sales expansion will come from cost reductions obtained through
improved capacity utilization rather than from realization of greater
economies of scale; i.e., diminished machine downtime, better allocation of
managerial time, greater regularity of sales and purchases, and similar
effects. An estimate of the increment in the firm's net income or
profitability due to telephone related increased sales volume averaged
2.8 percent of gross revenues across the nine Kenyan firms, and for the total
of all eight telecommunications induced efficiency benefits the increment in
the ratio of profits to revenues for each firm ranged from 1.3 percent to 7.3
percent with an average of 5.1. When compared with a rough estimate of the
cost of expanded telephone service, the study concludes that telephone calls
made by employees of these nine Kenyan firms are almost never worth less than
ten times their cost to the subscribers, and on average are worth over 100
times the cost; i.e., a large consumer surplus is associated with expanded
business telephone service in Nairobi.
Foreign Exchange Gains
3.06      In Kenya expanded telecommunications services also have the
potential for generating large domestic petroleum savings through transport
substitution and better transport coordination. Rapid communication can,
however, bring about foreign exchange savings in other ways including through
1/ The Impact of Telecommunications on the Performance of a Sample of
Business Enterprises in Kenya, a research report commissioned by the
International Telecommunication Union, August 1981.



- 19 -
better access to international markets. One such example in Kenya relates to
the Kenya Cashew Nut Company which is located in the Coastal Province in a
rural area between Mombasa and Malindi. When during the project period the
company gains access to its own telex conneotion which will allow management
to seek information and respond immediately in terms of prices and quantities
to offers and counter offers in the sometimes volatile international cashew
nut market, management estimates that the average price at which the company
will be able to sell the 18 different grades of cashew nuts which the company
markets will increase by a minimum of 5 per^ent. In current terms such an
increase would amount to an additional annu3l foreign exchange inflow to the
company and to Kenya of about US$750,000 (Amnex 11).
Fiscal Gains for Government
3.07      As from August 1, 1980, a 15 percent telecommunications tax was
added to bills issued by KPTC. This tax is paid by KPTC to Government at the
time the bills are issued. KPTC acts as thi Government's agent for the
collection of the tax; tax amounts included in the telephone bills are
therefore not reflected in KPTC's revenues. During the FY82-86 project
period, the telecommunications tax is estimated to yield the equivalent of
over US$95 million revenues to Government.
3.08      Funds generated by KPTC in excess of immediate needs are assumed to
be deposited with the Government, and can be used by Government for
development projects in other sectors to the extent they are not needed for
eventual compensation payments once the division of EAPTC's assets and
liabilities is finally settled (paragraph 5.01). During the project period,
KPTC is expected to generate the equivalent of over US$90 million in excess
of immediate needs. Furthermore, in 1980 over 30 percent of KENEXTEL
revenues for international services were made available to Government through
a 45 percent income tax, customs duties of 30-60 percent, and sales taxes.
During the project period, KPTC's payments to KENEXTEL are estimated to
exceed the equivalent of US$140 million, of which about 30 percent (over
US$40 million) in one form or another is expected to be made available to
Government.
Distribution of Benefits
3.09      Given the high potential gains to productive enterprizes from
telephone service expansion, the 1982-86 KPI'C investment program is designed
on the premise that the primary dominance of the network by business and
government administration usage is unlikely to change greatly over the
program period. As the program progresses, selected tariff increases
(paragraph 3.14) will further help to ensure that in serviced areas,
individual telephone usage is rationed in such a way that at the margin those
business and government subscribers who are willing to pay the higher prices
for telephones (and therefore who presumably will incur the most benefits
from having a telephone) can get one within, at most, two years of
application. The program is also designed to expand the share of
telecommunications to those provinces in which waiting 1ists and revenue per
line are the highest.



- 20 -
3.10      With regard to the equity aspects of the program, telephone service
is being significantly expanded into what government considers to be the high
priority rural and provincial areas. Public call offices will be installed
at approximately 110 small communities (rural, market and local centers) now
without telephone access, and small exchanges will be introduced into or
expanded in approximately 70 other communities. The increased access in
rural areas and in smaller communities in the provinces, together with a
potential financial cross-subsidy from urban subscribers to any rural public
call office or connection which in the short run do not generate sufficient
revenues to cover costs, should ensure a more equitable distribution of the
benefits of the telephone service in Kenya.
Tariff Policy
3.11      Average telephone revenue per line in 1981 was about US$740
(excluding the 15 percent tax), which is very high in comparison with most
other countries. Local calls are untimed; long distance calls are timed.
With the introduction of the new electronic digital switching equipment under
this project, consideration will be given to timing and peak period pricing
for local calls (paragraph 4.03).
3.12      For long distance calls, two charging rates are used:  a standard
day rate and a lower rate for nights and weekends. The night and weekend
rate reflects the lower marginal cost of carrying traffic outside of the busy
periods since system capacity is dimensioned for peak hour usage. The higher
daytime tariff ensures that those subscribers (primarily business and
government--paragraphs 1.06-1.11) who have the greatest need at peak times
will pay a price which more closely reflects the costs which they impose on
the system.
3.13      Per kilometer charges for long distance calls decrease with
distance, partly reflecting the decreasing costs. The three-minute manual
call rate is identical to the corresponding three-minute automatic (STD)
rate. Normally, the operating costs on manual calls are higher than on
automatic (STD) calls, and manual calls should therefore be charged at a
higher rate. However, since there is currently congestion on the STD
network, any attempt at raising manual call rates to encourage subscribers to
use the STD system would at this time only increase congestion. KPTC will
review the differential in rates as soon as an adequate grade of service can
be provided on STD. A summary of tariffs is set out in Annex 12.
3.14      As required under the first project, KPTC undertook a tariff study
which resulted in a report, dated December 1980, in which several issues
relating to tariff structure were examined. To avoid numerous disconnections
and reconnections and to better ration existing excess demand, the report
recommended increased charges for connection and reconnection and the
introduction of a subscriber deposit scheme. An additional September 1981
revenue review required for the preparation of this second Bank project found
that the 20 percent of KPTC's subscribers with lowest calling rate produced



- 21 -
only 2 percent of total revenue. This indicates that a not insignificant
minority of KPTC's subscribers do not make frequent use of their telephones;
hence, in this situation of telephone scarcity monthly rental charges should
be increased to discourage connection of low volume users to the system. As
of April 1, 1982, rental charges in automaAic exchange areas were increased
by 63 percent, and connection fees and deposits were also increased as set
out in Annex 12. The revised telecommunications tariffs for rentals,
connections, and deposits are satisfactory,
3.15      Proposals for changes in the collection rates for international
calls are initiated and prepared by KENEXTIL. No increases in these rates
are currently planned, as the collection2 rates exceeded corresponding
accounting rates by about 30 percent before the September 1981 devaluation of
about 18 percent.
Least Cost Solution
3.16      The configuration of KPTC's existing network and its proposed plans
for extending and improving service during the five-year (1982-86)
development period (paragraph 2.01) limit the number of viable alternative
solutions that could be considered to achieve the given targets. The timing
and dimensioning of the various work items proposed in the program, of which
this project is an integral part, are basecl on engineering studies designed
to introduce, where intended, electronic digital switching techniques, at the
least cost, and to select transmission techniques and equipment after study
of available alternatives. Given existing telecommunications technology, the
program as a whole represents a least cost solution to provide the quantities
and types of equipment which would meet the targets set out in KPTC's
five-year development plan.
Return on Investment
3.17      The internal financial rate of return, defined as the discount rate
which equalizes the present value of the cost and revenue streams (at 1981
price levels) attributable to the program, is 25 percent (Annex 13). With
the 15 percent tax on KPTC bills added to KPTC revenue (paragraph 3.07), and
payments to KENEXTEL reduced by 30 percent (paragraph 3.08), a minimum
estimate of the economic rate of return is 35 percent. Labor has not been
shadow priced as KPTC mostly employs skilled staff, of which there is no
surplus in Kenya. Neither has foreign exchange been shadow priced, as the
Kenya shilling appears fairly priced after its September 1981 devaluation by
18 percent.
3.18      The above rates of return significantly understate the real
benefits to be derived from KPTC's investment program, partly because the
benefits stream used in the calculation is based only on the current observed
2/ Collection rate is the rate at which the subscriber is billed and the
accounting rate is the rate on which revenue sharing between KENEXTEL and
other telecommunications organizations is based.



- 22 -
willingness of subscribers to pay for telecommunications services.  Hence,
the consumer surplus which subscribers and other callers receive is not
included in the calculation.  Evidence of the existence of a substantial
telecommunications consumer surplus was found in the study of the nine Kenyan
business enterprises (paragraph 3.05) and follows from an observed
non-responsiveness of demand to tariff changes. A 1975 tariff increase
caused only a small short-term decrease in traffic, and the introduction in
1980 of the 15 percent telecommunications tax (paragraph 3.07) did not affect
demand noticeably.
Risk
3.19      The project offers limited risk in attaining proposed institutionl
changes or securing adequate financial performance. The principal risk is
the possibility of delayed physical implementation due to procedural delays
and to unforeseen circumstances. KPTC's management can successfully execute
the project. In telecommunications projects, comprising a relatively large
number of independent works and activities, as in this case, delay in the
completion of some items of work does not generally prevent the utilization
of other newly created assets. Furthermore, costs and benefits are often
delayed in roughly the same degree so that the impact on the rate of return
is not significant. A sensitivity analysis on the financial rate of return
(Annex 13) indicates that a combination of 10 percent higher capital and
operating costs and 10 percent lower revenues than forecast, would result in
an internal financial rate of return of not less than 18 percent.
Environment and Health Aspects
3.20      No significant adverse environmental or health effects are expected
as a result of construction of project items. Since the project aims to
provide better telephone and telex services, it is possible that the growth
in vehicular traffic congestion during business hours in the larger urban
areas, particularly in Nairobi and Mombasa, will be better contained.
Extensive and reliable telecommunications services should also result in
better utilization of transport for movement of food, medicine and patients
in emergency situations.
IV. THE IMPLEMENTATION AGENCY
Organization
4.01      KPTC, the proposed beneficiary and project implementation agency,
is administered by a seven-member board of directors each having a three-year
tenure but who are eligible for reappointment. The chairman of the board,
and three other members are appointed by the Minister of Transport and
Communication taking into consideration their knowledge and experience in
communications matters or in commerce, industry, finance or administration.



- 23 -
The other two members are the permanent secretaries of the Ministry of
Transport and Communication, and of the Treasury. The seventh member is the
managing director, who is appointed by the Minister after consultations with
KPTC's board of directors. KPTC's day-to-day business is administered by the
managing director assisted by a deputy managing director. KPTC's organiza-
tion chart, which is set out at Annex 14, Li similar to that existing in many
other autonomous posts and telecommunicationis organizations and is generalLy
satisfactory.
4.02      On the telecommunications side of KPTC's operations, KPTC's
headquarters organization comprises five departments one each dealing with
financial matters, personnel, telecommunica:ions operations and planning,
buildings (planning and execution) and corporate planning and management
services. Outside headquarters, KPTC's activities are managed by five
regional managers, whose basic responsibili:ies comprise local planning and
construction, and operation and maintenance of facilities. These managers
are being given considerable freedom of action, and are now generally
delegated the necessary powers to enable theum to function effectively.
4.03      While this overall framework has Sin the past proven to be satisfac-
tory, in the future as KPTC's services expand rapidly, more attention is
needed for long-term planning and sector strategies on the economic,
financial, technical, and institutional aspects of KPTC's development.  KPTC
has therefore entrusted the long term plann'lng and strategy work to the
corporate planning and management services department. Such work would be
carried out by several economists, engineers and financial analysts for
examining such issues as (a) means by which KPTC development can better com-
plement and coordinate with national, provincial, district, and local
development programs in other sectors, (b) the monitoring of new expansion
programs in both the public and private sect;or with a view toward antici-
pating local telecommunications demand and refining demand forecasts and sub-
sequent exchange dimensioning, (c) identifying high priority investment needs
from a service and productivity point of view with the goal of eliminating
bottlenecks, (d) monitoring usage patterns (if current and future subscribers
and users by type, (e) examining the incremental costs of providing KPTC's
various urban and rural services, and (f) bzised on evolving technology and
data gathered under (a)-(e) periodically making recommendations about KPTC's
tariff structure and metering practices. KF'TC has already recruited seven
statisticians and proposes to further strengthen the department by recruiting
economists, engineers and financial analystE. During negotiations KPTC
assured that it would (i) by January 1, 1984 employ economists, financial
analysts and engineers in adequate numbers for its corporate planning and
management services department for the purpose of constant review of
intermediate and long term planning of the economic financial, technical and
institutional aspects of KPTC's development plans; and (ii) implement the
corporate planning department's recommendations on such aspects as shall be
agreed upon among the borrower, the Bank and KPTC.



- 24 -
Staff
4.04      As of January 1, 1982, KPTC's telecommunications staff totaled
about 7,150, of which about 6,650, were employed for telephone operations and
the balance used in telegraph, telex, and some postal operations. On that
date KPTC operated about 198,282 telephones and the staff ratio works out to
34 per thousand telephones. Staff size can be considered reasonable keeping
in view that KPTC operates (a) long distance facilities in remote areas using
an extensive open-wire system which needs a relatively higher level of
staffing; and (b) about 60 small capacity manual exchanges which require
basic staffing depending on the operating hours of the exchange and not on
the connections in service.
4.05      KPTC's senior engineering staff have gained sufficient experience
in project management in the previous Bank financed projects (paragraphs
1.24-1.26), are well qualified, and are generally capable of managing the
considerably expanded operations which will result from the project. KPTC
continues to employ expatriate staff, although the number of such staff have
declined to 10 in 1981 as a result of a policy of Kenyanization. KPTC plans
to continue the present policy to fully Kenyanize the staff by end 1983, and
should be able to do so.
4.06      During the project period, KPTC expects to recruit for its tele-
phone operations about 650 additional staff including about 400 engineers and
line and switching maintenance technicians, and 250 operators,
accountants and other support staff. At the end of the project in December
1986, KPTC would operate about 306,000 telephones connected on about 169,000
main lines, and the the staff productivity would improve to 24 per 1,000
telephones. Annex 15 sets out details of the number of employees in each
department from 1980 through 1986, the staff pay groups as of December 31,
1981, and a brief summary of service conditions. The pay scales are
generally attractive, and the requisite quality of staff can be recruited.
Turnover of staff is reported to be negligible.
Training
4.07      KPTC has a well equipped central training school situated on the
outskirts of Nairobi, and a regional training school in Nairobi.
Intermediate and advanced-level telecommunications courses are given at the
central school which can train a total of about 400 students simultaneously.
The central training school has been offering courses in finance and auditing
since 1978. The regional training school provides basic and vocational
training for about 250 students. The University of Nairobi provides graduate
courses in telecommunications engineering, and KPTC recruits such graduates.
Training in digital exchange techniques and maintenance of such exchanges
will be imparted by suppliers of the equipment financed under the project
(paragraph 2.05). The training arrangements are satisfactory.



- 25 -
Billing and Collection
4.08       Subscribers are billed monthly by computer.  Bills are issued to
the respective subscribers about three weeks after the closing date of the
billing period, and subscribers are expected to settle the bills in any post
office within two weeks of their receipt. If the bills are not paid, the
outstanding amount is included in the bill of the subsequent billing period
with a reminder to pay. If the total amount due the second bill is not paid
within two weeks, the subscribers' service is disconnected. The subscriber
can, however, be reconnected as long as his number is kept vacant (normally
three to four months), after having paid all pending bills and a reconnection
charge. Telephone accounts receivable as of December 31, 1980, amounted to
K Sh 175.4 million, of which K Sh 36.0 million were for service to
Government. This represents about four months of telephone billing. KPTC is
expected in 1982 to reduce its accounts receivable to the equivalent of about
three months of billing and keep them at that level for the rest of the
project period.
Accounting
4.09      According to the KPTC Act, KPTC's financial statements are required
to be prepared and submitted to the Controller and Auditor General within six
months of the end of KPTC's fiscal year. Up to 1979, however, KPTC was not
able to produce financial statements due to split up of EAPTC, loss or
unavailability of documentation, and deficient accounting procedures.
4.10      Under the first telecommunications project, KPTC agreed in 1979 to
review its accounting procedures and to retain a financial adviser to assist
in the implementation of new procedures as necessary. Subsequently, KPTC's
accounting has been significantly improved and from 1979, postal and
telecommunications operations are shown separately in KPTC's financial
statements, foreign loans are converted at 1;he exchange rate of the closing
date for KPTC's fiscal year, and corresponding exchange losses (gains) are
booked against income. Measures are also now being taken to improve the
accounting for and control of stores and cafpital works.
4.11      KPTC based its financial statement;s on actual bookings as from 1976
onwards and on a 1976 Cooper and Lybrand report on the split up of EAPTC's
assets and liabilities as of 1975. KPTC's financial statements up to 1978
were completed by the end of 1979, and the 1979 and 1980 statements by mid
1980 and 1981 respectively. The progress so far in improving KPTC's
accounting and presentation of its financial statements has exceeded or is in
line with what was agreed to and anticipated under the first Bank project.
4.12       KPTC's achievements on the accounting side under the first project
has been good so far and further improvements currently being studied or
implemented with assistance of its financial adviser, will bring about
continued positive future development. There is a need, however, to improve
budgetary control and cash management systems.  KPTC's revenues are spread
fairly evenly over time, but expenditures, especially for capital investment,



- 26 -
are quite lumpy. Even though KPTC is expected to generate more local funds
then will be needed for its 1982-86 investment program (paragraph 3.08), a
need for short-term local financing may occur in 1983 when the first and
second Bank projects overlap. In discussions with the appraisal mission,
KPTC's management agreed to strengthen current budgetary and cash management
procedures and to take steps to open credit lines with local banks. Progress
on these actions will be reviewed during negotiations.
Audit
4.13      According to the KPTC Act, the external audit of KPTC should be
carried out by the Controller and Audit Department of the Kenya Government,
which has a unit of about six people permanently assigned to KPTC accounts.
The audit report together with an operations report is submitted to the
Minister of Transport and Communication, w4ho then presents it to Parliament
within nine months of the end of each fiscal year.
4.14      KPTC's internal audit department was created in 1976 and currently
employs 15 persons, three with degrees in accounting.  The internal audit
concentrates mainly on checking cash transactions, purchases, stores and
billing. To strengthen the control over stores and purchases, a special unit
for supplies was created in 1978. These audit arrangements are satisfactory.
4.15      So far, the Controller and Auditor General has qualified the audit
certificates due to possible revision that may arise from a final agreement
by the former partner countries of EAC on the division of assets and
liabilities of the defunct EAPTC (paragraph 5.01).  The provision under the
first project, accepting provisional financial statements until the final
split up of EAPTC is settled, should be repeated under the second project.
During negotiations KPTC agreed to submit to the Bank financial statements
within six months of the end of its fiscal year and corresponding audit
report within nine months of the end of its fiscal year.
Insurance
4.16      KPTC has insurance coverage for buildings, internal plant and
stores, against fire and special perils.  Insurance protection is also
maintained for corporation vehicles, for cash in transit, personal liability
and revenue loss. These insurance arrangements are satisfactory.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Settlement of EAPTC's Assets and Liabilities
5.01      The final division of EAPTC's assets and liabilities among the
former member countries, after the breakup of EAC in 1975, is still pending.



- 27 -
A ;iiediator appointed to advise on the division submitted his findings and
recommendations to the countries concerned in October 1981, but the
acceptance of his recommendations and the final settlement may take
considerable time. Government has authorized KPTC to operate EAPTC's assets
and liabilities. However, these EAPTC assets and liabilities have not, and
should not, be declared property of KPTC (under the Kenya Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation Act of 1977, Section 116 (4)), until the
mediation effort is concluded. This situation implies that:
(a)  the financial statements for 1976-81 as presented by
KPTC, are provisional and may be adjusted according to a
future final settlement of EAPTC'; assets and
liabilities;
(b)  the financial projections for 198,'-86 are based on the
provisional statements for 1976-81, and, once a
settlement is reached, may have to be adjusted
accordingly; and
(c)  the financial covenants should be drafted to become
operative on a specific date subsequent to completion of
the mediation.
Nevertheless, during negotiations an understanding will be reached on how to
apply the principles underlying these covenants on the provisional financial
data, until such time as the mediation effort has been concluded and final
financial statements are available. Satisfactory agreements were reached
under the First Kenya Telecommunications Project by which the financial
covenants were applied to the provisional financial statements.
Postal Operations
5.02      In FY76-77, KPTC's postal revenues covered operating expenditures.
In FYs78-80 the postal operations incurred :osses of K Sh 4.3 million,
K Sh 28.2 million and K Sh 30.3 million in respective years. The
Government's policy is that the postal as well as telecommunications services
should be self-supporting.  In applying this policy, the Government expects
the postal branch of KPTC to curtail all unnecessary expenditures and if this
is insufficient to achieve self-sufficiency,, the Government is prepared to
increase the postal tariffs. A review of postal tariffs made in August 1981,
recommendated on increase of about 40 percent in the postal rates. The
Government approved this recommendation and the new rates were made effective
as from January 1, 1982. Telecommunications funds are now not expected to
finance the postal service during the project period. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained, that telecommunications revenues will not be used
for purposes other than telecommunications development and operations, unless
such revenues are in excess of telecommunications requirements.
5.03      As agreed during the first project, KPTC reviewed and carried out a
separation of telecommunications and postal accounts to obtain better



- 28 -
information for tariff setting decisions and better information on how funds
are used by each service. As from FY80, KPTC's financial statements provide
a complete break-down between postal and telecommunications operations.
Kenya External Telecommunications Company, Ltd.
5.04      All shares of the EAC EXTELCOM were held by EAPTC in 1975.  Kenya's
estimated part of these shares (current book value K Sh 21.2 million) is now
held by KPTC. KENEXTEL was formed in June 1978 as an independent government
company with the principal objective of managing Kenya's external
telecommunications.  As agreed under the first project, the operational
relationship between KPTC and KENEXTEL was more sharply defined in 1980.
Furthermore, as from April 1980, new terminal charges for international
telephone and telex services were made effective, increasing KPTC's net
revenues for international traffic by about 50 percent. Revisions of these
charges, based on cost estimates for each service, are provided for every two
years. These arrangements are satisfactory.
Past Financial Performance
5.05      KPTC's FYs79-81 income statements for its telecommunications
operations are given in Annex 16. A summary in K Sh million is given below:
Years ending December 31:         1979        1980        1981
Operating revenues               611.1       683.1       761.4

Rate of return  (%)1              26          23          25
1/  Assets valued at historic cost.
Payments to KENEXTEL for international services amount to about 35 percent of
KPTC's total operating costs. On assets revalued on a trial basis (paragraph
5.11), the rate of return in FYs79-81 would be 15 percent, 12 percent and
15 percent in respective years, wthich is satisfactory.
Present Financial Position
5.06      KPTC's FYs79-81 balance sheets for telecommunications operations
are given in Annex 17. A summary of FY81 is given below:

Debt over total capitalization (%)            31         -
1/ Including current portion of long-term debt.
Investments consist of EAC EXTELCOM shares (K Sh 21.2 million, see paragraph
5.04), sinking fund (K Sh 20.0 million), and funds in excess of KPTC's
immediate needs on short term deposit in government banks.
5.07      Under the first project, the Bank recommended that KPTC should
convert foreign currency loans to Kenya shillings according to the exchange
rate prevailing at the time of closing its b3ooks for its fiscal year. This
was done, and resulting exchange losses werea booked retroactively against the
incomes of corresponding years.  No exchange losses have so far been
capitalized.
5.08      At the end of 1981, KPTC's curreni: assets for telecommunications
operations equalled about two times current liabilities, and its long-term
debt equalled about 31 percent of total capitalization (without considering a
possible revaluation reserve), which indicate a strong financial position.
The eventual final settlement of EAPTC's assets and liabilities is not
expected to change this picture in a major vay.
Valuation of Assets
5.09      KPTC's records on fixed assets are incomplete and exact historic
cost and year of acquisition cannot be estat,lished for all items acquired
before 1976-77. The value of assets taken cut of service, therefore, does
not reduce the investment cost for the year of acquisition, but reduces the
cost of additions in the year the asset is retired. KPTC's accounting
procedures for fixed assets added after 1976-77 are now acceptable. New
assets added under the first and second projects will constitute an
increasingly higher proportion of total fixed assets. Less than 20 percent
of gross value and 10 percent of net value cf fixed assets in operation as of
1986 are expected to have been acquired before 1977. Errors in the booking



- 30 -
of old assets are therefore not likely to significantly distort KPTC's
financial position.
5.10      KPTC has made no effort to establish the effect of inflation on the
value of its fixed assets. A study of EAPTC by Coopers and Lybrand, dated
January 1976, concludes that the book value of EAPTC's gross fixed assets
needed to be increased by about 35 percent to reflect replacement cost at
December 1974. For lack of better information, the same percentage has been
used for the financial projections in this report and, as from 1975 onwards,
KPTC's fixed assets have been revalued at a rate of 7 percent per annum
according to estimated average increase in cost of telecommunications plant
and equipment (Annex 19).
5.11      Under the first project, KPTC agreed to revalue its fixed assets
according to methods acceptable to the Bank, and shortly thereafter KPTC
proposed a revaluation method to the Bank. After reviewing the situation,
however, the Bank agreed that KPTC's revaluation exercise should be postponed
until the mediators' report on valuation and the split up of EAPTC's assets
and liabilities was finalized, as a unilateral revaluation by KPTC could have
prejudiced its position during the mediation process. The mediator submitted
his findings and recommendations in October 1981, to the former EAC member
countries. Final agreement on the division of EAPTC's assets and liabilities
is, however, not expected in the near future. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that KPTC will, as from the end of such fiscal year
in which a final agreement on the division of EAPTC's assets and liabilities
is reached, review and establish the value of its fixed assets Ancording to
methods agreed on with tne Bank. Furthermore, KPTC will review the value of
its fixed assets annually thereafter and, if foreign prices and/or local
inflation indicate that the value of its fixed assets in operation have
changed by more than 10 percent since the previous revaluation, KPTC will
revalue these assets for the purpose of calculating a rate of return in
accordance with methods acceptable to the Bank. Until final agreement on
the division of EAPTC's assets and liabilities is reached, KPTC will base its
rate of return calculations on provisional assessments of the replacement
cost of net fixed assets in operation as recorded in KPTC's books.

telecommunications operations is presented in Annex 18. A summary is given

2/ Remaining part of proposed loar is expected to be disbursed during

5.13      Funds in excess of KPTC's immediate needs shown under "Investments
and deposits," are assumed to be depositec. with Government. These funds are
projected to increase by over US$90 millicin in 1982-86 (paragraph 3.08). A
November 1980 notification from the Minist;ry of Transport and Communication
outlines government policy on KPTC's surplus funds and indicates that they
should partly be invested in government stocks. The same document indicates
that a policy regarding payment of dividends by parastatal organizations is
under consideration. Furthermore, part of KPTC's surplus funds may have to
be reserved for the possibility that there may be compensations payable to
Uganda and Tanzania, when the division of EAPTC's assets and liabilities is
finally settled (paragraph 5.01). No dividends or interest on KPTC surplus
funds has been assumed for projection purposes. The relending terms for the
proposed Bank loan have been assumed to be a maximum of 15 years, including a



- 32 -
maximum of grace period of 4 years, with a minimum of 12 percent interest.3
The conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to the Bank,
between Government and KPTC is required as a condition of effectiveness for
the loan. The loan amount is US$44.7 million equivalent, including a one and
a half percent front end fee.
Status of Cofinancing
5.14      Of total 1982-86 capital works requirements, KPTC's internal cash
generation is expected to contribute about 34 percent, which is high
considering KPTC's large expansion program. The first Bank Loan 1680-KE will
contribute 5 percent, the proposed second Bank loan 20 percent and other
external financial sources 41 percent. KPTC has contracted financing from
Japanese, English, Dutch and other bilateral sources. The status of
cofinancing was reviewed during negotiations and the Bank was informed that
KPTC had obtained from Overseas Economic Cooporation Fund (OECF), Japan, the
equivalent of US$25.6 million needed to complete the project (paragraph
2.08). Furthermore, assurances were obtained that Government will make
necessary foreign exchange available to KPTC to complete the project.
Projected Financial Performance
5.15      Projections of KPTC's telecommunications operations financial
performance for 1982-86 are given in Annexes 16, 17 and 18. Notes and
assumptions are given in Annex 19. A summary is given below:
Years ending December 31-           1982  1983   1984   1985   1986
Operating income (K Sh million)    263   320    361    429    510
Operating ratio            (%)        72    71      72      71     70
Rate of return:
on book values           (%)        32    31      24      23     24
on revalued assets       (%)        20    20      16      16     17
Debt over capitalization (%)          35    43      44      43     43
Current ratio (times)                1.6   1.6    1.5    1.5    1.4
Debt service coverage  (times)       4.0   3.1    2.9    3.0    3.2
These projections are based on increased connection fees, deposits and
rentals as from 1982 (paragraph 3.14). The current procedure of recording
international revenues and expenditures on a gross basis produces a higher
3/ Inflation (GDP deflator) in Kenya was about 11 percent in 1981 and is
expected to be about 9 percent in 1982. As from 1983 inflation is
expected to moderate to about 7 percent. The interest charged by
Government in the past for similar lending is 6 percent-12 percent.



- 33 -
operating ratio than would be the case if international expenditures were
netted against corresponding revenues. This explains KPTC's relatively high
operating ratio. Furthermore, as funds in excess of KPTC's immediate needs
are recorded under investments and deposits (paragragh 5.13) outside current
assets, KPTC's current ratio may be understated. Taking this into
consideration, all above ratios are satisfactory.
5.16      During the project period, KPTC's financial performance will be
monitored against established performance indicators (Annex 10). To assure
KPTC's financial viability during and after the project period, the rate of
return requirement under previous Bank loans of 10 percent is repeated for
this proposed project. During negotiatioris, assurances were obtained that
KPTC's tariffs will be maintained at levels sufficient to achieve a rate of
return of at least 10 percent on revalued (paragraph 5.11) average net fixed
telecommunications assets in operation.
5.17      A sensitivity analysis of the financial projections as given in
Annexes 16-18 indicates that a 10 percent decrease of KPTC's revenues and a
10 percent increase in the cost of its investment program would produce a
reduction of internally generated funds ol about K Sh 860 million. The
project would be financially viable even under these conditions as KPTC is
expected to generate an amount of this ma(qnitude in excess of its immediate
needs during the project period (paragraphI 5.13).
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached that KPTC will:
(a) (i) by January 1, 1984 employ economists, financial
analysts and engineers in adequate numbers for its
corporate planning and management services department
for the purpose of constant review of intermediate and
long term planning of the economic financial, technical
and institutional aspects of KP-FC's development plans;
and (ii) implement the corporate planning and management
services department's recommendations on such aspects as
shall be agreed upon among the borrower, the Bank and
KPTC (paragraph 4.03);
(b) have its accounts and financial statements for each
financial year audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank, and furnish the Bank provisional
financial statements within six months of the end of its
fiscal year and corresponding audit report within nine
months of the end of its fiscal year (paragraph 4.15);



- 34 -
(c)  not use telecommunications revenues for purposes other
than telecommunications development and operations
unless such revenues are in excess of telecommunications
requirements (paragraph 5.02);
(d)  by end of such fiscal year in which the division of
EAPTC's assets and liabilities is finally settled,
review and establish the value of its fixed assets
according to methods acceptable to the Bank and revalue
these assets annually thereafter (paragraph 5.11); and
(e)  maintain its tariffs at levels sufficient to achieve a
rate of return of at least 10 percent on revalued
average net fixed telecommunications assets in operation
(paragraph 5.16).
6.02      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached that Government
will carry out and complete not later than July 1, 1983, a study with terms
of reference satisfactory to the Bank to assess the organizational and cost
economies that may be gained by the consolidation of the telecommunications
sector, and that the Government will, within three months upon completion of
this study, provide the Bank with a copy and exchange views on its recommen-
dations (paragraph 1.02).
6.03      The conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the
Bank between Government and KPTC has been agreed upon by Government as a con-
dition of effectiveness of the proposed loan (paragraph 5.13).
6.04      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$44.7 million on the usual terms.

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Example of Telex Induced Foreign Exchange Gains
1.         The Kenya Cashew Nuts Company (KCC), located between Mombasa and
Malindi as part of a government program to decentralize industry to rural
areas, serves as a collection and processing point for cashew nuts, and
markets them through five agents located in different centers throughout the
world. Several of the 18 grades of cashew nuts sold by the company
occasionally experience significant price movements on a day-to-day basis,
and through time. For example, one primary grade recently declined in price
67 percent over a three-month period.
2.         The accepted means of communicating with the company's five
marketing agents and keeping abreast of worldwide prices and contracted
quantities for cashew nuts is through telex. At this time the nearest telex
connection is located in Mombasa 35 miles distant; this connection is used
periodically by KCC with the agreement of the subscriber which rents it from
KPTC. This arrangement currently results in delays for KCC of up to two days
in the receipt of, analysis, and transmitted response to market information.
3.         Given such information delays, together with the sometimes rapid
price movements and slight price differentials between different markets,
KCC's management estimates that if they had access to two telex lines at the
processing plant, which would allow them to reduce message turnaround time to
less than one-half hour, they could on average secure five to ten percent
better prices for the cashew nuts which they market. Management cited
several recent instances in which because of a lack of timely information or
response, they sold low in a rising market or missed a sale in a falling
market. Given KCC's current foreign exchange earnings of about US$15 million
a year, a five percent increase in the average sale price of KCC cashew nuts
would amount to an additional US$750,000 per year foreign exchange earnings
for KCC, and for Kenya.
4.         As an interim measure, until KPTC can provide telex lines to the
plant, KCC management is in the process of opening a branch marketing office
in Mombasa which will have access to a shared telex line, and which will
maintain some contact with the processing plant through a magneto telephone
exchange connection. KCC management estimates that the Mombasa branch office
will cost KCC the equivalent of US$1,000 per month to operate and maintain.
This, of course, is a small fraction of the sales revenue increase which they
estimate will be the result of this somewhat improved but still cumbersome
communications link arrangement.

Return On Investment
1.        KPTC's 1982-86 investment program, of which the project is an
integral part, also includes ongoing works to be completed and other works to
be started during the project period. The cLose relationship between project
and non-project program parts make any attempt to separate incremental costs
and revenues for the project part very arbitr-ary. The rate of return
calculated in the following, therefore, refers to the whole of KPTC's 1982-86
investment program.
2.        For the calculations, the nominal values of incremental costs and
revenues have been deflated by 10% for 1982, and 7% for subsequent years
(projected DGP deflator) to reflect constant values in 1981 price levels.
3.        The benefit period extends from 1953 to 2005, when on average the
equipment provided under the program is expefted to have substantially
completed its useful life.
4.        Projected incremental costs and revenues for the program are based
on additional assets, telephone and telex subscribers and traffic brought
about by the program, excluding financing costs, taxes and depreciation. As
from 1987, incremental cost and revenues are assumed to remain constant in
real terms. All payments to KENEXTEL for international services, however,
are included as operating expenditures for the calculations of the financial
rate of return. About 30% of these payments are passed on by KENEXTEL to
Government (see paragraph 3.10), in form of taxes, dividends or deposits of
surplus funds.
5.        No residual values of fixed assets have been taken into account as
their discounted 1981 real values would be insignificant.
6.        A summary of estimated incremental cost and revenue streams at 1981
price level is given below in K.Sh millions:

1984       0.80         332.0        125.0     317.6      (139.4)
1985       0.75         276.9       167.9      448.1         3.3
1986       0.70         233.0       214.5      578.6       131.1
1987       0.65            5.0      228.5      715.0       481.5
1988-05    0.61            -        228.5      715.0       486.5
The net benefit stream above results in a financial rate of return of 25.0%.
7.        A sensivity analysis was performed with the following results:
10% increase in capital expenditures               22.7%
10% increase in operating costs                    23.6%
10% decrease in revenues                           21.1%
Combination of all above                           17.8%
8.        The decrease in real terms since 1975 of telephone tariffs and
current unsatisfied demand (paragraph 1.16) indicate the existance of a
consumer surplus. The telecommunications tax of 15% added to all
subscribers' bills (paragraph 3.09) would constitute a minimum estimate of
this consumer surplus. Furthermore, about 30% of KPTC's payments to KENEXTEL
are passed on to Government as taxes, dividends or deposits. Adding the 15%
telecommunications tax to KPTC's revenues and reducing KPTC's payments to
KENEXTEL by 30% would result in an estimated economic rate of return of
35.1%.
9.        Labor has not been shadow-priced in above calculations as most of
KPTC staff is qualified and in demand for use in other sectors. The K.Sh has
not been shadow priced as the official exchange rate, after its September
1981 devaluation of about 18%, is considered appropriate.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPERATION
Notes And Assumptions On Financial Statements
Income Statement
1.        Rental.  Projections are based on l-Y81 revenues plus the rental for
one exclusive line (K Sh 960/year as from FY32) for average number of main
lines in 1982-86.
2.        Call charges are a mixture of local and domestic long distance
charges. No discrimination is currently available. Traffic is expected to
grow by 15% annually as from 1982.
3.        International revenues are expecteJ to increase by 30% in 1982,
when the international exchange is put into service, and thereafter by 20%
annually.
4.        Connection fees are based on the number of subscribers connected
each year under the program and expected connection fee of K Sh 600 as from
FY82.
5.        Telegraph revenues are expected to remain at about 1981 levels
throughout the project period.
6.        Telex revenues include rentals, traffic charges and connection
fees. OveTr90% of call revenue are derived from international traffic.
Projections are based on the average number of subscribers for each year
times the rental fee plus call charges growing at an annual rate of 20% as
from 1982.
7.        Miscellaneous revenues are expected to grow by 10% annually.
8.        Operating expenses for administration, operation, accommodation,
training and pension fund are assumed to increase proportionally to staffing
costs. An index based on number of staff, Inflation rate and a 2% per year
increase in real wages was constructed for t;his purpose. This index
indicates an annual increase in costs of about 15%.
9.        Costs for international services aire based on the terminal charges
introduced in April 1980 and are assumed to increase as from 1981 at the same
rate as international revenues. The following approximate percentages of
international call charges will be paid by KPTC to KENEXTEL: telephone 81%,
telex 94% and telegraph 90%.

10.       Maintenance costs are expected to increase at the rate of
inflation, as equipment added under the program is expected to need
substantially less maintenance than existing equipment.
11.       Depreciation has been calculated at 5% of gross fixed assets in
operation.
12.       Miscellaneous expenses are expected to increase at the rate of
inflation.
13.       Non-operating income for 1981 include the retroactive adjustment
for international services between April 1980 to December 1980 (see paragraph
9 above) totalling K Sh 9.2 million. As from 1982 non-operating income is
expected to grow by K Sh .5 million annually.
14.       Interest and loan charges for FY79-81 include exchange
losses/gains. No exchange losses have been projected as from 1982. The one
and a half percent up front fee (K.Sh 7.0 million) is included in FY82.
KPTC's official financial statements also show redemptions and sinking fund
under interest with a corresponding adjustment of equity. This procedure
distorts KPTC's results and has therefore been eliminated for the
presentation in this report.
Balance Sheet
15.       Fixed assets are projected according to KPTC's construction program
and no capitalization of interest or exchange losses is contemplated. The
revaluation adjustments for the purpose of calculating rate of return and
operating ratio are based on:
(a) The Cooper and Lybrand report, which indicates: that
the gross value of fixed assets as at December 31,
19,74, should be revalued about 35% and that accumulated
depreciation at that date should be revalued 50%
(including adjustments for insufficient depreciation in
the past.
(b) As from 1975, a 7% revaluation has been applied based
on estimated average increase in replacement cost of
telecommunications plant and equipment.
16.       Work in progress is assumed to equal the capital expenditures for
the year.
17.       Investments and deposits consists of EA EXTELCOM shares (K Sh 21.2
million as of December 1981) and funds in excess of KPTC's immediate needs
assumed to be deposited with the Kenyan Government. If the EA EXTELCOM
shares are transferred to Government, KPTC is assumed to be compensated for

the full value. Investments and deposits are projected to be about K Sh
1,060 million at the end of the project period. However, part of these funds
will have to be reserved for payment of eventual compensations to Uganda and
Tanzania, when the final settlement of assets and liabilities is made between
the countries in the former East African Conmmunity (see paragraph 5.01).
18.       Cash and banks are assumed to increase by 15% annually, which is
expected to be adequate for KPTC's operations.
19.       Accounts receivable are expected to equal three months of billing
as from 1982.
20        Stores are expected to increase 20% per year.
21.       No transfers to the postal service are expected to be made as from
1982 due to projected postal tariff increase (see paragraph 5.02).
22.       Equity.  Increases are expected only through retained earnings.
23.       Long-term debt includes estimated exchange losses on foreign debt.
The exchange losses are mostly unrealized anid the exact value can be
determined only after the final settlement of EAPTC's liabilities (paragraph
5.01).
24.       Pension fund liability as shown in this report is the net
liability, e.g., provisions made but not ye-c paid to the pension fund. The
liability is expected to remain at 1981 levels throughout the project
period. Contributions to the pension fund -,urrently equal about 25% of total
wages. The same percentages has been usec for the projections. KPTC's own
financial statements show the funds invested for the pension fund as an asset
(at cost) and the full pension liability. 'ension funds are invested in
stocks and fixed deposits with the Kenya Government (except for foreign
investments from the EAC days administered .y the Crown Agents) and are
unrelated to KPTC's telecommunications operations.
25.       International services liabilities are expected to grow at the same
rate as international revenues.
26.       Other current liabilities consists of liabilities to Government for
the 15% telecommunications tax introduced in 1980 and to suppliers for goods
received and booked in KPTC's stores, but nDt yet paid for. A 20% increase
per year has been assumed for the project psriod.
