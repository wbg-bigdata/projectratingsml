duureg            peri-urban district of the capital.
dzud              Any winter weather conditions which prevent livestock
from obtaining open forage for grazing.
ger               round felt dwelling used by pastoral herders and
residents of outer districts of urban settlements.
khashaa            a livestock enclosure, or a fenced enclosure around a ger,
wooden house or group of dwellings.

INTRODUCTION
1.1           BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
The overall goal of the Sustainable Livelihoods Project is, "to help the
Government of Mongolia develop and implement a non-welfarist national
anti-poverty strategy to foster secure and sustainable livelihoods for all."
(PCD, p. 12).
The project is to be implemented through the Poverty Alleviation Project
Office (PAPO) 1 with the assistance of a World Bank IDA loan. It is planned in
three phases over twelve years. Phase one is a pilot phase spread over the first
four years. Phase II would scale up the activities to national level, with Phase
III focused on fine-tuning the innovations so that they may be institutionalized
over the longer term. The stated strategy behind the three phases is to
combine the geographical expansion of the activities with the deepening of
institutional and policy reforms over time. Total cost of the first phase is 20
million US dollars. Sixteen million dollars is to be made available from the
World Bank IDA loan, with government contributing ten percent of the total
and the remainder to come from co-financing, as yet to be determined.
This social assessment is focused foremost on social issues arising in the first
project phase. The stated development objective of the first project phase is:
* to identify and pilot-test innovations that will enhance the capabilities of
community groups and poor and vulnerable households and individuals to
better manage risk, build up income generating assets, and participate in
the creation and maintenance of community-level infrastructure.
Eight 'core aimags' have been selected for the first phase of the project. These
are Bayankhongor, Bayan Olgii, Dornod, Dundgobi, Omnogobi, Ovorkhangai,
Tov, and Uvs. These aimags were selected on the basis of high poverty
incidence, low local tax revenue per capita, absence of other donor assistance,
large market size, high net migration, high dzud probability, high land
degradation and good local implementation capacity2. All five of the major
ecological zones found in Mongolian - high mountains, forest steppe, steppe,
desert steppe and desert - are represented among the eight core aimags.
Among the core aimags are aimags that are both physically remote and those
that are more accessible to the center.
Four project components have been designed. These are:
(1) Under the Sustainable Livelihoods Project this office is to be renamed the 'Livelihoods Support Programmne Office', or
LSPO. Hereafter in this report PAPO will be referred to as ISPO.
(2) Criteria agreed by GoM and local consultants at the National Consultation Workshop in late July/early August 2001.

* Pastoral risk management which would include institutional innovations
in pasture tenure and management, including support for community-
based herders' associations; hay and fodder production, conservation
and/or marketing; livestock marketing; early warning and emergency
response systems; conflict management; and a financially and socially
sustainable approach to restocking the herds of moderately poor and
transitory poor herding households. Within local areas each of these
options would receive a different degree of emphasis as appropriate to
ecological conditions.
* Rural micro-finance services including savings, credit for productive
purposes and consumption smoothing, and possibly insurance services
made available to poor rural and urban households. Existing expertise will
be built upon as much as possible to develop micro-finance institutions that
reach effectively into remote areas of the country that are currently poorly
served by such facilities, while remaining financially viable.
* A 'Local Initiative' Fund3 consisting of an untied fund made available to
local communities. It is intended to be used for infrastructure and social
service provision identified, co-financed and executed by local community
groups.
* Project Management, which consists of a framework to devolve
responsibility for direct project management to aimag (provincial) level
while retaining overall responsibility for co-ordination, monitoring and
evaluation, and fiduciary oversight at central level.
The target population is stated in the PCD as "poor and vulnerable
individuals, households and communities in rural areas and smaller urban
settlements". It is intended that benefits should accrue not only to poor
herding households but to those in aimag and sum centers (in particular
through the LIF and micro-finance components). The LIF and micro-finance
components (but not PRM) will also be piloted in one duureg of Ulaan Baatar.
It is stated explicitly in project preparation documents that some of the
poorest and most vulnerable people will continue to rely on social safety nets
and are not directly targeted by all project activities.
1.2          ROLE OF THE SOCIAL ASSESSMENT IN PROJECT DESIGN
1.2.1        Overall purpose and scope
The overall question the social assessment sought to answer was how the
proposed project activities will affect the intended beneficiaries and other key
stakeholders. Several topics were pursued to that end: (i) the compatibility of
the project design with the livelihood strategies of the socio-economic groups
targeted; (ii) differences in livelihood strategies of richer and poorer
households within the project area and the risk of inequalities being worsened
(3) Referred to in previous project documents as the 'Community Investment Fund'.

by the project or benefits being captured disproportionately by elites; (iii)
potentials for the proposed project to foster the participation of the poorer and
more vulnerable members of society; (iv) the potential role of local institutions
in the same process; and (v) the possible impact of the project on ethnic
minority groups within the project area.
The assessment focused on the core aimags where the project is to be
implemented in its first phase. Based on this analysis, recommendations are
made for ensuring:
* that the project is designed to avoid adverse impacts and minimize social

• that poorer and more vulnerable members of society actually benefit from
activities directed towards them, that they are supportive of the final
project design, and actively involved in its implementation.
This report is addressed to staff involved in SLP preparation within the
Government of Mongolia, as well as project consultants and concerned parties
within the World Bank. The report and recommendations are intended to be
shared and discussed between these parties and used as an input into the final
design of the project.
The Social Assessment has been conducted in keeping with World Bank
recommendations for Social Assessment as described in GP10.05.
1.2.2       Methodology
The following methods were used to gather information for the social
assessment:
* A review of literature and socio-economic studies of the project population
residing within or near the proposed project area. Sources consulted are
listed in the bibliography at the end of the report;
* A review of government statistics;
* In-depth interviews with government representatives, NGOs and
representatives of research institutions;
* In-depth household interviews and group discussions. A total of 38
household interviews were conducted.
Short field visits were made to five of the eight pilot aimags. Two sums in Tov
were visited in short day trips from the capital, and a two week field trip was
conducted to Uvs, Bayan Olgii, Bayankhongor and Ovorkhangai aimags.
Interviews were conducted in a total of 14 bags in 9 sums. The sums visited are
listed below.

As may be appreciated, the TOR for the social assessment required an
extensive range of topics to be studied in a short period of time, while
budgetary, time and travel constraints prevented extended field visits from
being conducted. A decision was made to prioritize potentially vulnerable
ethnic minority groups in the selection of aimags to be visited. This resulted in
Uvs and Bayan Olgii being selected as the main field sites. While these are
both appropriate sites for studying ethnic diversity, they are two of the most
remote of the core aimag and thus do not present some of the problems typical
of the more central aimags (high concentrations of people and livestock, high
levels of conflict over pasture use).
Because of these constraints, the social assessment aims to provide an
overview of the main social issues to be addressed in the design and
implementation of the SLP. Areas which warrant more in-depth research as
part of the on-going process of social assessment are also identified in the
recommendations at the end of the report.
Early drafts of the main conclusions and recommendations were discussed in
detail with the social assessment team (CSD staff) and LSPO officers prior to
the consultant's departure from Mongolia.
Annex I contains a summary of data required from each of the administrative
levels, and guidelines for topics to be covered in the interviews.
Annex II provides an account of activities undertaken and persons
interviewed during the consultancy.
The Terms of Reference for the social assessment is found in Annex III.

2           THE SOCIAL ASSESSMENTANALYSIS
2.1         DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILE OF PROJECT AFECTED
POPULATIONS
2.1.1       Overview of the core aimags
Bayan Olgii aimag is situated in the extreme west of the country. It shares
international borders with the People's Republic of China and the Russian
Republic. To the northeast it borders Uvs aimag; Khovd aimag lies to the
northeast. It is located in the highest part of the Mongolian Altai range.
Livestock is the main economic activity in the aimag, and some fodder and
grain is grown in river valleys. The majority of inhabitants in the province are
Kazakhs. The other main ethnic groups in the province are Uriankhai, Tuva,
Dorvod and Khalkh. A major social issue of concern for the province is the
poor living conditions of Kazakhs who immigrated to the newly independent
state of Kazakhstan in the early 1990s. Many subsequently returned to Bayan
Olgii because of a lack of opportunity in Kazakhstan; they now make up a
disproportionate number of the poor within the aimag.
Bayankhongor aimag is situated in the central region of Mongolia, stretching
eastward from Gobi Altai aimag and bordering the People's Republic of China
in the south. The Khangai Nuruu mountain range dominates the northern part
of the aimag. The tail end of the Gobi Altai range reaches into the center of the
aimag and includes some of the most elevated parts of that range. However,
terrain in the Gobi Altai range is dry and barren, in comparison with relatively
high levels of precipitation and richer vegetation in the Khangai Nuruu. The
'leg' of the province jutting out to the south extends into the dry hillocks and
desert of the Gobi. The population is principally Khalkh.
Dornod Aimag, the easternmost province in the country, borders Russia to the
north and China to the south. Proximity to both of these neighbors presents
trade advantages to the aimag. Steppe stretches for almost 300 km in the far
east of the province; and the depression of Hoh Nuur Lake is found to the
north. Steppe and arid steppe prevail in the aimag, while the three rivers
basins (Onon, Olz, Herlen and Halhlyn Gol) experience relatively higher
levels of precipitation. The river basins of Onon, Halhlyn Gol and Herlen are
important farming regions of the country. Khalkh are the overall majority in
the province, but Buriad form the majority in the north of the aimag, and the
Barga minority inhabits the east. The population of the aimag is more
urbanized in comparison to other provinces of the country. The Buriad are
known for the continuance of their traditional skills as artisans, blacksmiths
and hunters.
Dundgobi (Central Gobi) aimag is situated east of Ovorkhangai and south of
Tov within the boundaries of the Middle Khalkha hilly plain. The landscape is

dominated by steppes, rich in grasslands in the northern part of the province,
and more arid to the south and east. These are broken up by low hills and
small mountain ridges covered by more dense vegetation, and sometimes
poplar and willow groves. The best known of these, the Delerkhangai ridge,
rises to an elevation of nearly 2000m in the south west of the aimag. The
southern and eastern parts of the aimag are quite arid. Camel breeding plays a
prominent role in livestock breeding, alongside sheep breeding. The main
ethnic group is Khalkh.
Omnogobi (South Gobi) aimag is situated in the extreme south of the
country. It borders on Ovorkhangai and Dundgobi to the north west and on
the People's Republic of China to the south. It is the largest aimag in the
country, (covering an area of 165 OOOkm2), while the population is very sparse.
The great mountain massifs of the eastern section of the Gobi Altai and the
Gobi Tian Shan ranges rise within the aimag, arid desert ranges dissected by
deep grottoes and gorges. Other important features of the landscape are the
vast depressions covered with salt pans and sands, where outstanding
prehistoric remains were first discovered in the early 1920s. The aimag owns
the largest camel herds in the country.
Ovorkhangai aimag is situated in the central region of Mongolia, east of
Bayankhongor. Although its land area is relatively small (62, 900km2)
compared to other aimags, it displays nearly the complete set of ecological
zones of Mongolia, from forest steppe to semi desert. Wooded mountains of
the eastern end of the Khangai Nuruu range extend into the north west of
Ovorkhangai aimag. The southern half of the aimag is desert steppe,
interrupted by the arid ranges of the Baga Bogd and Arts Bogd, extensions of
the Gobi Altai system. The population consists almost entirely of Khalkh
Mongols. Animal husbandry has in the past been mainly sheep and horse
breeding, though increases in the export price for cashmere have seen a rise in
the number of goats in the province.
Tov (Central) aimag surrounds the capital Ulaan Baatar and is the most
centrally situated province in the country4. The Tuul river bisects the province
from east to west. The Khentii mountain range occupies the northern section,
its spurs covered by pine, deciduous forests and alpine tundra above the tree-
line. The southern part is rolling steppe with low mountains and hills rising at
the Bogd Uul mountain range, which forms the southern border of Ulaan
Baatar. Agriculture is practiced in the northern part of the province while
livestock breeding is the main activity of rural households in other parts of the
province. The aimag has a key role to play in servicing both the capital and the
Trans-Mongolian railway. Proximity to Ulaan Baatar means many migrants
from remote aimags have been drawn here in the last few years. As a
consequence, conflict over grazing land and concern about the carrying
capacity of pasture are prominent issues in the province.
(4) The meaning of 'Tov' is 'central'.

Uvs aimag is located in the north east corner of the country, bordering Tuva in
the Russian republic in the north, Khovd aimag to the south, Bayan Olgii aimag
to the west and Zavkhan to the south east. The province encompasses the
Kharkhiraa, Turgen and Khan Khokhii mountain ranges and the northern part
of the Great Lakes Depression. The climate is extreme, with temperatures
ranging from highs of 40 degrees Celsius to recorded lows of minus 50 and
below in the depression where Uvs Nuur is situated. Winters are dry and
summer rainfall is low. The main activity in rural areas is herding with some
river valleys favorable to farming (along the banks of the Baruun Turuun river
in Tarialan sum, where the Khoton ethnic group have traditionally farmed
millet wheat and fodder crops). The population is ethnically diverse, a
mixture of groups mainly of Turkic origin: Dorvod make up over half the
population, the other main ethnic groups being Khalkh, Bayan and Khoton. A
matter of serious concern within the province is the situation of lawless along
the northern border, caused by gangs conducting raids across from the
Russian side of the border to steal livestock5.
2.1.2            Population
The core aimags vary greatly in size and population, from  Bayan Olgii, which
covers the smallest area of the core aimags (45 700 km2) but has the highest
population density (2.07 persons/ km2), to Omnogobi whose desert expanses
encompass the largest area of any of the core aimags (165 400 km2) yet contain
the lowest population density (0.28 persons/km2). Of the core aimags, Dornod
has the largest percentage of its population residing at the aimag center, with
the 'urban' population making up 55% of the aimag population6. Ovorkhangai
and Tov aimags both have very small percentages of their populations living at
the aimag center, well below national averages. In the latter case this may be
explained by the proximity of Ulaan Baatar. Average household size is lowest
in Ornnogobi at 3.9 persons/hh, while Bayankhongor is slightly above with
households averaging 4.7 persons.

2.1.3       Demographic trends
The transition from a centrally planned economy to a 'free market' system has
driven quite dramatic changes in population distribution. One important
feature of the privatization of the 1990s was the cutting of state employees
from the public payroll. This prompted many of the newly unemployed to
move from urban areas and take up herding in the countryside. The number
of herding households more than doubled as a consequence, a pattern which
can be seen in all the core aimags.

From the mid 1990s the flow of migrants from urban to rural areas has slowed,
to be overtaken by movements of people from smaller to larger settled areas
(i.e. from sum centres to aimag centres, and from aimag centres to the capital)
and of pastoral herders from more remote areas of the country to the central
aimags in order to benefit from better terms of trade, and higher quality social
services. The pull of the capital has been the strongest: it has received a net
inflow of migrants in the last five years, while all the regions have had a net
outflow of migrants over the same period. Despite significant movements of
people from more remote regions to the central region, the center still
experienced a net loss of migrants, but this may be explained by movements
from the central regions to the capital.

In addition to these overall patterns of migration, more localized trends have
been experienced in some core aimags. In Uvs aimag a situation of lawlessness
has developed since the mid 1990s in sums sharing a border with Tuva in the
Russian Republic. Armed gangs have been crossing the border from Tuva to
steal livestock on the Mongolian side. This has resulted in movements of
herders from the border areas to Ulaangom and to rural bags further south.
Among the ethnic Kazakh population, the flow of migrants from Mongolia to
the newly independent state of Kazakhstan has been stronger than flows of
migration from the remote to the central regions of Mongolia. Of a total of
58887 people who left Mongolia for Kazakhstan, 44951 have been from Bayan
Olgii aimag.

The most recent events to have an impact on population movements have
been the dzud weather conditions experienced in 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, in
which drought conditions were followed by harsh winters. Many herders who
had lost their entire herds or signLificant numbers of livestock moved to settled
areas in sum or aimag centres to seek out other ways to make a living. Urban-
to-rural migrants who were relatively inexperienced as herders and not
equipped to cope made up a disproportionate number of those who suffered
severe losses.
2.1.4         Poverty
The last decade has seen an increase in poverty. Just over one half of urban
people are poor or very poor and just under one half of rural people live
below the poverty line7. The most recent data available (for 1998) shows that
the incidence of poverty is higher in the core aimags more remote from the
center (Dornod, Uvs, Bayan Olgii and Bayankhongor), underlining the greater
econom-ic opportunities available in the central region of the country. The
possible connection between ethnicity and relatively high rates of poverty in
Dornod, Uvs and Bayan Olgii is discussed in the section on ethnicity. The
percentage of households below the poverty line in Tov, Omnogobi and
Dundgobi aimags is below the national average.

Within the core aimags the poorest people tend to be found primarily in sum
and aimag centres in the more remote provinces. They cannot afford to move
to more central urban centres where opportunities are greater, and have
limited support networks and few income earning opportunities.
2.1.5        Social indicators
Health indicators for the core aimags are consistent with national trends which
depict a steady decline in infant mortality rates over the last decade, but a
concurrent increase in maternal mortality. Bayan Olgii has a particularly high
maternal mortality rate.

2.2          ETHNIcT
There are over 30 ethnic groups in Mongolia. All groups are either the
descendants of Mongolian nomadic tribes, or are groups of Turkic origin who
have become Mongolised over time. The Khalkh make up the majority and
comprise over 90% of the population. Barring the Kazakh, all of these groups
speak Mongolian dialects which are comprehensible to speakers of Khalkh
and to each other. The largest group of Turkic origin in the country, the
Kazakh, are the only ethnic group to speak a distinct language8. Unlike the
other groups who have beliefs based on Buddhist and shamanist practices, the
Kazakh are Islamic. The Khalkh Mongolians and the Buriad are the most
urbanized of the ethnic groups.

2.2.1          Ethnic populations within the core aimags
Khalkh Mongols comprise the ethnic majority in six of the eight core aimags.
Other ethnic groups make up a significant share of some regional populations,
notably in two of the pilot aimags. Kazakh form the majority in Bayan Olgii
aimag, and smaller numbers of Kazakh are to be found elsewhere in the
country, mainly in the capital and the industrial centres. Although Khalkh
Mongols are the largest ethnic group in Dornod aimag in the far east of the
country, Buriad are in the majority in five sums within the aimag. Uvs is the
most ethnically diverse of the pilot aimags: the main ethnic groups are Dorvod
and Bayad, and smaller groups form the majority in a few sums (e.g. Khoton in
Tarialan sum).

Annex III also provides a breakdown of populations by ethnicity for other
aimags in the country. It should be noted from this data that as the project
expands beyond Phase One, it will come to include other aimags that are
ethnically diverse, or in which ethnic minority groups make up a large
proportion of the population. Among them are Selenge, Khentii, Sukhbaatar,
Khovd, and Khuvsguul.
Other aimags are largely ethnically homogeneous.
2.2.2          Cultural distinctions and similarities
Mobile pastoralism has traditionally been practiced within Mongolia, and
indeed across the inner Asian region (extending into Tuva, Buryatia and South
Chita in the Russian Republic, and Inner Mongolia and some parts of Xinjiang
in China). This common nomadic way of life has fostered a relatively uniform
Mongol culture over extensive areas, with large groups of people sharing
similar livelihoods, having frequent contacts with speakers of other dialects,
and developing related social and cultural practices over the centuries.
Ethnic distinctions
Text Box 1: Kazakh Identity                       among the Mongol
subgroups are

Kazakhstan since 1991, of which 44, 951 were from Bayan Olgii.
Recent years have seen a shift; since 1995 over 5000 Kazakh  pastoral techniques
have returned from Kazakhstan.                            may be adaptations to
different environments
as much as they are markers of ethnicitylO. While language differences and
their Islamic beliefs may make ethnic distinctions appear to be more marked
between the Kazakh and the Mongol subgroups, Kazakh livelihoods are not
significantly different from those of the Mongol subgroups. One of the rural
sums visited in Uvs province was a majority Khalkh sum and local government
officials there made a point of saying that the Khalkh comprise a minority in
Uvs province, implying that tribal identification continues to play some role,
albeit minor, in provincial politics. OveralL however, language or tribal
differences have not become significant political or social issues in Mongolia.
(9) Though all ethnic groups are reliant on a diet based heavily on dairy and meat products, there are ways in which dairy
is processed and meat is prepared which are recognised to be distinct to some ethnic groups. An example of this is the
Kazakh staple of dried horsemeat or 'khaz'; horse is not generally eaten by any other ethnic group in the country.
(10) For example, different patterns of herd separation and exchange among the Khalkh, Dorvod and Zakhchin groups, as
observed by Shombodon in Humphrey and Sneath, 1996.

Text Box 2: Historical roots of ethnic groupings
Most ethnic groups in Mongolia are descended from Mongolian speaking nomadic tribes initially
consolidated around the Khalkha Mongols and merged into a united Mongolian state under
Chinggis Khan in the 12th -13th centuries. Western groups (including the Dorvod, Bayad,
Zakhchin, Oold, Khoton and Khoshuud) formed in the past part of the Oirad Union and
traditionally lived on both sides of the Altai mountains, The Oold were once one of the largest of
the Oirad groups but their numbers were drastically reduced through conflicts in the past with
Manchu -Chinese. Oirad are ethnically related to the Kalmyks, people of western Mongolian
origin who migrated to Russia from 1600 onwards to settle on the east banks of the Volga. The
Torguud, who live mainly in the southern part of Khovd province, but are also found in
significant numbers in Selenge and Sukhbaatar - are also of Kalmyk origin, descendants of those
who returned from the Volga in the late 18th century.
Some groups are considered to be southern Mongols, including the Kharchins, Tsakhar, and
Uzemchin. Although now settled in Dornod aimag, these groups are said to have originated in
neighbouring Inner Mongolia in China, and continue to speak southern dialects of Mongolian.
Dialects spoken by Barga and Khamnigan groups in Domod aimag relates them to the Buriad. The
Buriad are one of the larger ethnic groups in the region, and are found not only in eastern
Mongolia but across the borders in both China and the Russian Republic.
The Uriankhai are of Turkic origin and live mainly in the western aimags of Khovd and Bayan-
Olgii. They are ethnically close to Tuvans but their language is Mongolian. The Tsaatan reindeer
herders in Khuvsgul province are also considered to be of Uriankhai stock, but live in relative
isolation and lead a unique way of life based on reindeer herding; attempts in the 1980s to bring
them down from the remote areas they traditionally inhabit and assimilate them into mainstream
society are now recognized to have been unsuccessful and unwise. The Darkhad of Khovsgol are
also an Uriankhai group, said to have become recognised as a distinct ethnic group when they
were called upon to guard the banners of Chinggis Khan.
Several ethnic groups are of Turkic origin but have been Mongolised over the last centuries. The
Sartuul of Zavkhan and Khotgoids of Khuvsgul are Mongolised Turks, as are the Khoton, who it
is claimed were Uighurs brought in the 18th century from eastern Turkestan to cultivate land to
supply the Manchu army. To this day, the Khoton continue to farm millet, wheat and fodder
crops along the banks of the Baruun Turuun river in Tarialan sum in Uvs province. Officials in
that province observed that the combination of agriculture and herding gives the group
somewhat better living standards than others in the aimag.
Information compiledfrom Berger and Bartholemnew, 1996; Humphrey, 1994; Dashtseren, 1997; Federal
Research Division, 1989; Becker, 1992.
The presence of the Kazakh in Mongolia is relatively recent. It dates from the early 19th century
when they brought their herds from Kazakhstan and Xinjiang to summer in pastures in what is
now Bayan Olgii aimag. Borders could be freely crossed up until the 1930s. The Buriad population
increased in the early 20th century when many Buriad came across the border following the
Russian Revolution. Here too, cross border movements were not restricted until the 1930s and to
this day the Buriad spoken in Dornod includes many Russian words.
In aimags that are ethnically homogeneous, the Khalkh make up the majority
and a small number of people of other ethnic groups are either intermarried or
otherwise socially and economically assimilated to the majority. The recent
influx of migrants into the central aimags has resulted in a greater ethnic mix
in these provinces than was the case several years ago. A local government
official in Tov commented that people tend to disperse in the province when
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                                     WORLD BANK
2525



they arrive from more remote provinces, and do not noticeably congregate
along ethnic lines. Common economic goals override ethnic distinctions and
the influx of immigrants has not resulted in such distinctions becoming more
acute, he claimed.
2.2.3           Language and Education
Khalkha Mongolian dominates among
the Mongolian dialects and forms the             Text Box 3: Kazakh education

language. Mongolian is a member of             Kazakh is the main language of instruction in 35 of

2.2.4           Ethnicity and social indicators
The National Statistical Office does not currently disaggregate social
indicators by ethnicity13. Thus while claims were made in field interviews
about the social organization and socio-economic position of some of the main
ethnic groups, these cannot be substantiated with census data, except to
(11) The language of the Tsaatan reindeer herders is a classified as a Manchu-Tungusic language; it is not clear the extent

contacted for the social assessment in October 2001, information linking ethnicity to social indicators was unavailable.

extrapolate from the aimag level data in Bayan Olgii, the only core aimag with a
large majority of a single ethnic population.
Data shows the population of Bayan Olgii has a higher birth-rate than the
national average and a higher incidence of maternal mortality. Aimag officials
claimed that the practice of Islam among the majority of the population results
in lower divorce rates and fewer children born to unmarried women. Data on
women headed households (see table below) in Bayan Olgii provides support
for this claim. Most women-headed households in the province are headed by
widows, with fewer such households formed as a result of divorce or children
born out of wedlock. Religious practice may also explain why Kazakh women
do not readily marry with non Kazakh men, though Kazakh men intermarry
with other ethnic groups more easily. Social organization is quite different
from other ethnic groups, with higher numbers of extended families living
together. It is not clear whether the higher incidence of maternal mortality is
caused by birth practices distinct to the Kazakh. Bayan Olgii has one of the
lower infant mortality rates, suggesting the situation may be more complex.
However this is an issue that should be explored if LIF funding is to go
towards health projects in that aimag.

2.2.5       Gender and Ethnicity
The question has been raised in project preparation documents of whether
Islamic beliefs among the Kazakh may prevent Kazakh women from
participating in the project as fully as women of other ethnicities. This is a
complex issue, but as a starting point, assumptions should not be made about
Islamic practices based on the practice of Islam in other countries.
Maternity rates higher in Bayan Olgii than the national average might suggest
Kazakh women are more hesitant than other women to visit medical facilities,
(although this would need to be substantiated through more in depth
research) and claims of lower divorce rates and low levels of intermarriage

might also imply that the Kazakh community, more than other ethnic
communities, exerts more control over women to stay within traditional social
structures, and within their own communities. That said, in our interactions
with Kazakh women in Bayan Olgii, there were many indications that Islam is
interpreted quite moderately among Kazakh in the aimag. Roles and behaviors
acceptable for women appear to be much less the subject of debate than they
are in some other Islamic countries. Older and middle aged women often
appear in public wearing headscarves, but younger women generally do not.
Nor do women appear to be overly restricted in their interactions with male
strangers, (as is sometimes the case in other Islamic cultures); for example,
invited to eat lunch with a sum governor at his house, we were joined by his
wife who sat to eat with us and actively joined in the discussion.
2.3          STAKEHOLDER GROUPS
"Stakeholders" are defined here as either direct beneficiaries of the project, or
those who hold a stake in the project because their livelihoods are in some
way connected to those of the targeted beneficiaries. While institutional
players can also be considered to be stakeholders in the project, their roles,
responsibilities and relationships vis-A-vis the beneficiaries are explored in a
later section (Section II H. 'Capacity of Local Institutions'). Stakeholders can be
grouped together in a number of different ways. Socio- economic, or well-
being categories, provide useful tools for analysis in ensuring the project
addresses the needs of more disadvantaged households. However people are
more likely to organize their daily lives on the basis of family and friendship
ties, which may cross-cut socio-economic differences.
Socio-economic categories are the most relevant categories, for a project that
seeks to monitor poverty reduction, within which to group stakeholders in the
project area. The Participatory Living Standards Assessment (PLSA) - which
developed well-being categories through wealth ranking with local people in
a number of different sites in Mongolia - describes four main socioeconomic
categories and shows that the characteristics of each of these types of
households vary by well-being but also according to location. Thus better-off
herding households will have quite different characteristics both from better-
off households in settled areas, and from herding households at the bottom
end of the well-being ladder. The last three categories - middle vulnerable,
poor and very poor - are the well-being categories targeted by the SLP.
The social assessment team relied on a fast and easy method to determine the
well-being status of the households interviewed. Quite simply, we asked local
officials and local people how they viewed the status of the households visited
for the field interviews, aiming to gather a number of different opinions for
each household interviewed. In each of the field sites visited the same four
loose categories were used to classify households: "better-off", "middle
income" (but clearly vulnerable in many cases to sudden downturns in their
fortunes), "poor" and "very poor". The characteristics of households for
whom data was collected for the social assessment fit quite closely to the
ENVIRONMENTAL REsoURCES MANAGEMENT                            WORLD BANK
2828



characteristics of each well-being category as described in the PLSA.14 Two
exceptions were the average numbers of livestock owned by households in
each well-being category: the PLSA figures are much higher. This may be
because the number of interviews conducted for the SA is too small to gain an
accurate picture; it may also be because PLSA data was conducted prior to the
most recent dzud. In addition, our informants only considered herding
households to be "very poor" if they had no livestock and no other viable
means of subsistence: the PLSA ranks households with very few livestock
among the "very poor".
Section II E 1. ('Livelihoods of the different stakeholder groups') describes
typical characteristics of households in the different well-being categories.
It is important to note that grouping the stakeholders by their well-being is a
useful tool for analysis, but does not provide clear-cut definitions of who is
rich and who is poor. Rather, well-being categories describe characteristics
that tend to be found in better-off or poorer households. The situation of each
individual household is usually more complex.
Although local people can readily place other households on a socio-economic
ladder, family and friendship ties are probably more important means
through which they identify with others and organize their daily lives. These
networks may cross cut-socio economic distinctions as, for example, a poorer
person might seek the help of a wealthier person who is distantly related. It is
these types of groups that most closely resemble the 'community groups' that
are frequently mentioned in project documents.
Social organization and kinship relations are described in more detail in
Section II G. ('Social and Kinship Organization of Communities').
While gender and ethnicity are further means through which people identify
themselves in the project area, we found no evidence in the field sites visited
of local 'community groups' organized along these lines. The gendered
division of labor within herding communities results in groups of men and
groups of women working closely together, but these are very informal
groups and are at some distance from the more formal workings of
organizations (such as the Women's Federation), who work to represent the
interests of a specific group. Similarly, ethnic differences do not seem to result
in people organizing themselves into distinct community groups along ethnic
lines.

2.4          LOCAL LAND TENURE AND RESOURCE USE SYSTEMS
2.4.1        Changes in patterns of resource use
For herders across the country the changes of the past decade have resulted in
new patterns of pastoral land and resource use. In-depth studies site four
main characteristics of change:
* concentration of livestock near towns and roads;
* high rates of out-of-season and year-round grazing of key resources
previously used in only one or two seasons;
trespassing on customary winter and spring pasture reserves; and
* declines in the distance and frequency of seasonal nomadic moves. 15
Changing land use patterns have resulted in increased conflicts over pasture,
most notably in aimags in the central part of the country. Among the core
aimags these would include Tov and parts of Ovorkhangai. It should be noted,
however, that livestock numbers in each of the core aimags have not increased
as dramatically as the number of herding households in the last decade. This
suggests that conflicts over land use are generated not by an absolute lack of
appropriate pasture land, but by an unbalanced distribution of livestock and
herders across the landscape.

A table in Annex IV breaks this data down by species. For some species of
livestock, numbers by aimag have decreased since 1990. Goats are the only
species whose numbers have increased in all the core aimags in the last ten
(15) Femandez-Gimenez, 1997, and Humphrey and Sneath 1999 both provide in depth analyses of these changes.

years. Goat numbers have more than doubled in four core aimags within the
time period (Bayankhongor, Ovorkhangai, Omnogobi and Tov). This is a sign
of greater commercialization of herding among some herders, in response to
high prices obtained for cashmere.
2.4.2           Grassland tenure arrangements
The social assessment, according to the terms of reference, should seek to
obtain information about whether grasslands are "privately contracted or
used as a group'16. 'Privately contracted' is taken here to mean pasture for
which herders have formal long-term possession contracts (the only legal
category under which herders could hold tenure for pasture); 'used as a
group' is understood to refer to the existence of pastures whose use is shared
between herders. In addition this section will assess the relative security of
tenure of poorer households over shelters and pasture use, as compared to
that of better-off households.
Formal long term grassland tenure arrangements are controversial. There is a
lack of clarity in the Land Law as it applies to 'possession contracts' over
grazing land17. There are risks that more secure individual rights over grazing
land could result in escalated rather than decreased conflict over land use and
would reduce herders' options for responding to bad weather. In addition
attempts to create more formal pasture use rights raise sensitive and emotive
questions about the legitimacy of customary land use claims18. Because of
these sensitivities, representatives of both LSPO and MoFA stated in
interviews with the social assessment team that they did not wish to include
the issuance of possession certificates as an activity within the SLP19.
The most recent Land Law (1998) does not permit private ownership over
pasture land, but 'possession rights' may be granted to herders. Land remains
the property of the state but herders - in groups or as individuals - may be
granted long term exclusive use rights over grazing land for a period of up to
60 years20. Most aimags shy away from this interpretation of the Land Law,
preferring instead to understand the law to mean herders are entitled to
possession rights over their winter shelters or winter camps, but maintaining
that the surrounding pasture cannot be assigned to the exclusive use of one
individual or group.
(16) SA TOR 7
(17) The Land Law could be interpreted either as (i) allowing possession contracts for winter camps only, or (ii) allowing
possession contracts for winter camps and winter pastures. Meanwhile, the privatisation of pasture land is prohibited
under the Constitution. See Duncan and Hanstad, 1999
(18) Defining criteria for determining the area to be contracted is problematic: contracting pasture based on current
livestock numbers may limit the opportunities of herders who currently have few livestock. Other criteria make the debate
even more difficult and complex: Duncan and Hanstad cite the case of a sum govemor arguing the legitimacy of claims
based on pasture use in pre-revolutionary times against claims based on pasture use in the collective period.

However, there is one province among the core aimag which has begun to
issue possession certificates for winter pasture. The governor of Tov aimag
informed us that the province is now in the process of issuing possession
certificates to herders for winter/spring pastures.21 He explained that
increased numbers of herders and livestock, increased conflicts and
overgrazing in the province had necessitated the contracting of pasture land.
Some households in Tov have already received possession contracts, while
others have not. We met with members of a herders' association22 in Erdene
sum who have already received a possession contract. A group of 15 herding
households had secured a possession contract for 25 years on their shared
winter spring pasture, and a contract of 60 years on a more distant haymaking
area. Other households consulted in the SA fieldwork in Tov were in a peri-
urban bag of Zuunmod town. The two individuals interviewed who owned
livestock said they did not have contracts for pasture, but both claimed this
was not a concern as they had very few animals and were not relying solely
on livestock raising, having opportunities in the town for employment23.
We came across examples of the more 'conservative' interpretations of the
Land Law in sums visited in the far western core aimags (in Uvs and Bayan
Olgii). In rural sums in these provinces, winter shelters were private property
but the land on which they stood was leased by the state. Herders did not
have formal leases over the surrounding pasture24. Similarly, 'formal tenure'
of herders in Nariin Teel sum, Ovorkhangai, consisted of contracts on winter
camps only, and authorities in Bayankhongor said no contracts had been
allocated in that province over pasture land.
Yearly pasture use agreements are another element of local authorities'
strategies to allocate and control the use of grazing resources. Local officials in
the far western aimags (Uvs, Bayan Olgii) described apparently well-organized
systems of planning and negotiation over pasture use. In Omnogobi sum, Uvs
province, we were told sum officials map the land area, identifying which
pastures are expected to be appropriate in a given season. Using these maps,
agreements for pasture use are drawn up each year between herders at bag
level meetings. The maps and agreements vary from year to year depending
upon the quality and quantity of pasture in a given year. Negotiations are
(21) The area allocated is to be calculated on the basis of the number of sheep units in the herd times the amount of pasture
required by each animal for a period of seven months 1.4 ha is used as the amount of pasture required per month per sheep
unit. Herders have exclusive pasturing rights from September to May over the areas they have been allocated. He claims
the areas allocated adhere to the existing winter /spring camps of herding households within the province. This winter, a
small charge is to be introduced for herders on their tenured land, to be based upon the quality and size of pasture
allocated. Interview with Mr. Mondoony Mendibileg, Tov Aimag govemor, 3/10/01. Note also that at the time Duncan and
Handstad conducted their interviews in 1999 they found rights to winter camps had been allocated in Tov aimag but no
steps had been made at that time to grant possession rights for winter pastures. 1-7.

then made between the sums and aimags to create provisions for herders to
cross sum and aimag boundaries in the case of bad winter weather25.
Customary agreements between herders for the use of camps and pasture are
based upon shared expectations built up over time by herders with
longstanding relationships with one another. While there is an obligation to
respect the territory others have marked out for their camps and, in particular
their winter pastures, there is also an obligation to come to the assistance of
other herders in bad weather: customary use rights are to be respected, but the
risks of bad weather must be shared. As one herder explained, land use is
traditionally regulated through the principle that: "Everyone has a winter and
a summer camp. We all know where these camps are and that we are not to
use the surrounding pastures."26 Although a herder may be unhappy at
having his customarily pasture infringed upon by others during dzud, he
reacts with compassion as he expects that others will share their pastures with
him when he finds himself in the same circumstances.
Customary pasture agreements sometimes accord, and sometimes conflict
with pasture use agreements made with local authorities. Out of season
grazing goes against customary codes of conduct and herders may appeal to
local authorities against infractions. But dzud related trespasses, while
undesirable, are more tolerated. An aimag official in Bayankhongor bemoaned
the fact that, although the authorities establish regulations for pasture use,
they are not always followed because local people cannot say 'no' to each
other: the sums can negotiate over land use but when it comes down to an
emergency herders cannot turn each other away, especially if they themselves
received help in previous dzud years.
In our field interviews we heard some complaints of out of season grazing on
winter pastures, and listened to several herders acknowledge openly that they
did not necessarily follow official directives during the most recent dzuds but
took their herds to anywhere where they could find available pasture. A
herder in Songino district of Zavkhan, whom we spoke to while en route to
field sites in Uvs aimag, said he took his animals to otor during the last two
dzud winters to any place where he could find pasture. Last year he went to
another bag within this sum; the year prior to that he traveled with his herds
200km away to Khovsgol Nuur. In both these cases he was infringing on the
winter pasture customarily used by other households. He admits that those
whose land he infringed upon were not happy about this, but in his words,
"what could I do?" He was charged a penalty of 50 000 MNT for infringement
by the relevant sums27
(25) Such a meeting had just taken place in Omnogobi sum, Uvs aimag prior to the field visit. It brought together sum
governors from the westemn region, including sums in Bayan Olgii, Khovd and Uvs aimags. All sums in the region are very
short on pasture for the comning winter and it was agreed that some 30 000 herders from surrounding sums will be entitled
to use winter pasture in Omnogobi sum. In addition, 15 herders from Omnogobi sum will move in winter south to Khovd
aimag. SA interview with sum officials, Omnogobi sum, Uvs aimag 13/10/01.

One key argument against the issuance of possession contracts for pasture
land is that it risks breaking down the customary social contract, reducing
herders' options for responding to dzud by giving title holders a legal claim to
drive others off their pasture. It is not clear whether contracts issued to groups
of herders (as opposed to individual herders) would alleviate this problem, as
herder groups could just as easily drive others away in case of dzud.
This type of customary use system appeared to continue to function
reasonably well in the more remote sums visited in Uvs aimag (Zuunkhangai,
Omnogobi) and in Bayan Olgii. Although there were some conflicts over land
the main concern when the SA field interviews were conducted was the risk of
insufficient pasture this coming winter, and how to react to this possibility.
Officials and local people interviewed in Bayankhongor and Ovorkhangai
indicated that three long years of drought have put pressures on customary
use systems in these aimags as grazing is poor virtually everywhere this year.
Clearly though, customary agreements over land use have broken down to a
much greater extent in areas which have experienced a high influx of
migrants, as longstanding relationships and shared expectations built up over
time are the bases upon which these understandings rest.
Establishing this type of collective understating in areas where herders are
new to each other can be expected to involve a long process of negotiation and
re negotiation. No doubt it will depend in part on pressures of herd and
livestock numbers being relieved in areas of highest concentrations. An
example from the herders association visited in Erdene sum, Tov aimag was
interesting in this regard. The group had plans to move their winter camp to a
more distant haymaking area. This area was more remote and much further
from the road but the group felt that now their transportation was better
organized, it was an advantage to move away from the road and more
crowded areas to an area where they could enjoy better pasture28.
Shared use of pasture is not uncommon among herders. Pastures are usually
shared between households with herds large enough to justify separating
herds, and with the appropriate household labor and relationships to enable
them to organize herding in this way. Herding households sharing pasture are
usually family (parents and adult children in separate households) or close
friends. The herders' association in Tov that had been allocated contracts over
shared pasture (mentioned above), was made up of 15 households, 6 of which
were households headed by fathers or their grown sons, and 9 of which
consisted of close friends. There are numerous other examples of households
with customary use rights sharing seasonal pastures: some of these may be
firm arrangements practiced from year to year, and others may be more
temporary and flexible. One older man in Omnogobi sum, in Uvs aimag had
begun to work together more closely since the recent dzud within a group of 9
households (this included households of his grown children and 3 close
friends). They worked jointly to make hay and separate herds for pasturing
(28) SA interview with member of herders' association in Erdene sum, Tov aimag, 4/10/01.

and were sharing their customary pasture to undertake these activities29. A
herder in a rural bag of Zuunkhangai sum, also in Uvs, extended the use of his
winter camp (for which he held a lease) to his brother who had no shelter of
his own and the two brothers shared the same pasture for the winter. They
had invited their brother-in-law, who was living in the sum center for the
summer, to join them to winter on the same pastures. He had yet decided,
they said, whether to do so, suggesting that some arrangements over shared
pasture are very flexible30.
Existing pasture use rights of households with few livestock are less secure
in some cases than the pasture use rights of better-off herders. Some studies
have observed that in areas with higher levels of in-migration, newcomers to
herding claim informal rights through relationships with distant kin or
acquaintances, which tend to be less secure than those of households who
possess their own winter shelters and campsites. The latter tends to strengthen
defacto claims to the surrounding pastures. Furthermore, the newcomers tend
to have greater constraints on mobility that prompt them to trespass more
frequently than better-off households31.
However, studies conducted in two remote sums in Dornod and Uvs
provinces in 1994 came to different conclusions. From these studies it was
observed that the claims of poor households, were no less secure than those of
the better-off. This was because the demands poor households placed on
common resources were so small as to be insignificant, but also because of
longstanding relationships between the parties concerned. Better-off
households were content to have the livestock of poorer household graze out
of season on pasture that the better-off would use only in selected seasons32.
One household interviewed for the social assessment in Nariin Teel sum of
Bayankhongor aimag described a similar relationship between the better-off
and the poor; he was camped near to the sum center and owned livestock that
number less than ten, having lost most of his herd in the dzuds. He said he no
longer bothered to move away from the winter camp near the sum center,
where we interviewed him, as he had too few livestock to make the move
feasible. This did not pose problems for other herders who used the area for
winter pasture, he claimed, as the impact of his few animals on the pasture out
of season was insignificant. Likewise he said he did not attend bag meetings
relating to pasture use as he said did not have enough livestock to necessitate
becoming involved in negotiations about pasture use33.

In more remote and less populated aimag it is clear that levels of security over
tenure are higher. The willingness of herders in Bayan Olgiii to build solid
brick and plaster dwellings at each of their seasonal camps (with sometimes,
but not always, a ger present) indicated a relatively high level of confidence
among these herders about their claims on the surrounding pasture. An
elderly head of household interviewed in his camp just outside of Ulaankhuvs
sum center would not count among the very wealthiest herders interviewed
during the social assessment, but said he had four brick houses, one in each of
his camps, and he had been using these same camps and houses from between
13 to 20 years34.
2.4.3        Seasonal patterns of grassland use and livestock movement patterns
Seasonal patterns of grassland use vary according to the ecological features
within the region, and the relative mobility of individual herders.
The basic strategy is for herders to make use of natural water sources in the
summer months, and to move in winter to sites that are otherwise unusable
because of a shortage of water, and/or which provide some form of natural
protection from the cold and wind. In winter, snow is melted or ice hauled in
to supply water for the camp. Thus herders can be found near rivers in broad
valleys and at lower elevations during the summer months, and in winter in
places with better protection, often in mountains or foothills, in sheltered
valleys or on the leeward side of outcrops. Conversely herders may move
down to drier Gobi areas in the winter months.
It has been said that there is traditionally a two-season herding pattern (camps
established in winter and summer) in the eastern parts of the country, with
fewer moves over shorter distances, and a four-season pattern in the far
west35. This four season patterned corresponded to seasonal patterns of
grassland use described by herders in Uvs and Bayan Olgii, where middle-
income and better-off herders had established summer and winter camps with
intermediate stops in between where they would set up camp in autumn or
spring. In Tov and Ovorkhangai, herders who were continuing to make
nomadic moves spoke of maintaining only two seasonal camps, for
winter/spring and summer/autumn.
The better-off tend to migrate longer distances and make more rational use of
the ecological zones available to them. They are usually able to do this because
they have the means to use mechanized transport to move their gers, but the
size of their herds also means they need to do this to obtain sufficient pasture.
Poorer households practice seasonal movements within a smaller radius (if
they move at all) as they lack access to transportation.

Livestock movement patterns of the better-off are also quite different than
those of herders further down the socio-economic ladder.
Certain kinds of 'maximizing behavior' can be seen to be practiced by better-
off herders. These herders will aim either with their existing labor resources or
through hired or pooled labor to take their herds to graze in areas most
appropriate to them in a given season. The most skilled herders base their
livestock moves on extensive experience and knowledge of pasture and of
each animal species. Using this knowledge they may conduct otor movements,
when one party takes herds away from the seasonal camp for an extended
period. This may also include summer/autumn moves to salt pans, again by a
satellite group separating from the main camp to move to another location for
periods up to two months. Another strategy used by better-off, skilled herders
is to separate herds by species between households, with each household
taking a different species to graze in a different area.
These moves are based on a detailed knowledge of the needs of each species,
the available resources and the fine balance of weather conditions necessary
for ample accessible pasture from one season to the next. As it was explained
on a winter slope in Bayangol bag of Omnogobi sum, a few inches of snow on
the slope is vital for keeping the dry grass standing; no snow and high winds
will flatten and trample it making it inaccessible to animals in early spring; too
much snow however, will make the pasture inaccessible to animals in the
winter.36
Some better-off herders interviewed claimed that poorer households were not
making the most of the available resources, both because they did not make
the effort to undertake long moves and because their knowledge of their
animals and the ecology was poor.
It is likely that households with little available labor and few livestock find it
difficult to orchestrate such complex movements and, in their circumstances,
might not think it worthwhile. Poorer households may compromise by
grazing a small herd of mixed species in a site suited to the species that makes
up the majority of their herds.
A comparison of the two different types of strategies is offered in an example
from Zuunkhangai sum in Uvs aimag in the box below.

Text Box 4: The preferences of yaks and other influences on livestock movements
in Zuunkhangai sun, Uvs aimag
Yaks make up a significant proportion of herds in this mountain steppe area and their preference
for the cool weather found in higher reaches in sumuner mean that summer camps tend to be
situated at higher elevations. However, better-off households locate their summer camps in the
higher reaches and keep their yaks there, but move smaller animals down to better water sources
and richer summer pasture at lower elevations. This is performed either as a satellite movement
(otor) from the higher suimmer camp, or by dividing bod and bog between two or more households,
with one household camping for the summer with the small animals at a lower elevation and
another group remaining with the yaks and larger livestock at higher elevations. Households with
more limited resources may choose to remain at a lower elevation if their herds are composed
mainly of small animals; they may camp at the higher elevation if their yaks are of the greatest
importance to them. Likewise some households were found to take their own and relatives' larger
livestock to the warmer winter camp, and send their smaller livestock to higher pastures nearer to
sum centre.
SA interviews with herders and local officials, 10 and 11/10/01
While poorer households are generally restricted in their mobility, there are
also more localized and specific causes of reduced mobility, and overgrazing.
In Uvs province, herders have responded to the raids carried out by livestock
rustlers across from Tuva in the Russian Republic by camping in larger than
usual ail groups, and herding together in larger groups in areas close to their
camps. While other good pasture exists in other parts of these districts, there is
too high a risk involved in trying to make use of it. An aimag official
interviewed in Ulaangom said that relatively high livestock losses as a result
of dzud in these border districts can also be attributed to herders' reluctance to
undertake otor for fear of making their herds more vulnerable to theft37.
2.5            LIVELIHOOD STRATEGIES AND PRODUCTION SYSTEMS
2.5.1          Livelihoods of the different stakeholdergroups
The livelihood strategies of settled populations are quite different from those
of people herding livestock in rural areas. Within each of these areas,
significant differences also exist between the livelihood strategies of the better-
off and of those further down the socio-economic ladder.
Better-off herders in settled areas often have at least one member of the
family holding down a secure job, usually in the state sector. Several of the
wealthier households interviewed for the SA in the western aimags were
involved in trade, and were taking full advantage of the considerable price
differences between remote and central areas for certain types of goods. They
may have their own transport or access to transport, which they can use to
travel to the capital or border areas to buy goods which can then be resold at
high prices in their home areas. Often they are also involved in buying

livestock products from herders. Frequently, long term credit is extended for
consumer goods and basic essentials (flour, tea) on the condition that these
credits are repaid in livestock products once they come into season. One
official in a more remote sum complained that just about everyone in the sum
was in debt to local traders38. Often these households will have 'placed'
livestock with relatives in rural bags. Better-off herders in our interviews
spoke of owning herds of up to 100 head of animals which are tended in this
way.
These households are typically made up of married couples with older
children or young skilled couples whose parents are financially secure
themselves.
Many traders were happy to continue this activity while others recognized
that the 'windfall' profits they were currently making could not last long as
others took up trading and the competition increased. Some spoke of wishing
to invest in potentially more stable, productive activities (processing of
livestock products was one example) which would create employment for
others, but said that it was very difficult to obtain credit to make such
investments39.
Households in the 'middle vulnerable' category in settled areas are typically
involved in a number of different income generating activities. There is likely
to be at least one household member with a full-time salaried position, and
/or someone involved in artisanal activities (such as carpentry, construction,
boot making, etc.). These relatively reliable income generating activities will
often be supplemented by activities to provide for household consumption -
small vegetable plots and one or two dairy cows kept within the compound to
supply the house with milk. Households involved in small-scale production
activities are economically vulnerable for two reasons. Firstly, their markets
are very limited, although those nearer to larger urban center are better
placed. Secondly, a significant proportion of their clientele are herders in rural
areas; when herders experience hardship due to dzud, this is passed on to
these small-scale businesspeople, in the form of reduced sales. Much of their
business is done by barter, particularly in rural areas, with artisans acquiring
livestock and livestock products which they then resell. Artisans interviewed
for the social assessment spoke of wanting to expand their businesses, or
wanting external support for strengthening marketing networks. Poor
availability of credit was mentioned as an obstacle in expanding businesses.
Peri-urban households in the middle vulnerable category often seek to find a
balance between the advantages of settled areas, and those of the countryside.
They typically have one salaried job in the family, but also keep livestock.
However, they will limit the number of livestock they keep, so as to enable
them to have adequate pasture without undertaking lengthy migrations and

having to be away from the sum center for long periods. One woman said she
wanted to maintain this balance between salaried work and herding as it was
well suited to the needs of household members: it allowed her two young girls
to go to school nearby, permitted the family to get fairly good prices for the
livestock products they sold and purchase goods relatively cheaply, and
allowed them to remain close to her parents-in-law who were retired and
living in the sum center.40
Households interviewed in settled areas who fall in to this category were all
married couples with children who were either grown up and moved away
from home, or older and able to help with the family business and/or other
work within the household.
Poor households in settled areas are either unemployed or if they have work
it is unstable and low paying. Usually adults in these households have some
kind of skill which they are not managing to make good use of. For some, they
had secure jobs in the past which they have lost, with a subsequent drop in
their standards of living. This was true, for example, of returnees from
Kazakhstan in settled areas of Bayan Olgii. Livelihoods of poor households
are based upon any type of work they can find in return for cash, from the
resale of goods, to temporary work in construction, or for small businesses.
Some may be involved in some type of artisanal activity but do not have
sufficient marketing skills or connections to make a good living, or do not
have adequate financing to buy raw materials and create regular work for
themselves. One strategy is to find an activity that involves a minimum of
investment; for example one couple who had returned from Kazakhstan with
no assets was making bricks. This required no cash investment on their part as
the bricks are entirely made by hand of local materials4l. Older children may
be sent to live/work with relatives whose living situation is better, for
example, to rural relatives to help them with herding. Often the household
relies heavily on the pension of one older family member.
Single parent households are often found in this category, as are households
with adults laid off during the transition period. While people feel they could
improve their situation if they had some money to invest to strengthen the
activities they are presently undertaking, others feel it is necessary for more
jobs to be created to improve the lives of people in their situation. For Kazakh
returnees, housing is also a priority.
Households described as very poor in settled areas are characterized by
physical or mental disability in one or more of the household members,
and/or social problems such as alcoholism. Such problems afflict adult family
members who would otherwise be the key income earners within the
household. Accordingly, household livelihood strategies are very limited. If
there is a pension or allowance received by a family member, this will often

serve as the mainstay of the whole household, and be used to obtain basic
essentials from traders. Often these households have considerable debts to
traders and pension cards in some places are used as a type of credit
guarantee. Other forms of support are charity from neighbors, who may not
be much better-off themselves, and occasional government assistance
(handouts of rice, flour, etc.). Poor households may be involved in very low
paying activities such as collecting dung, selling wood or broom-making.
Some sum officials had encouraged certain households to take up these
activities in order to guarantee them some kind of income no matter how
low42. Poor people in aimag centres also spoke of garbage collecting and
recycling of cans and bottles. One woman admitted her daughters resorted to
begging43. It is likely that more can be made of waste collection in the larger
aimag centres; the relative anonymity afforded by the aimag center as opposed
to a sum settlement may mean the poor are more prepared to beg in aimag
centres.
Households in this category are overwhelmingly single parent households.
Often, the poorest households are headed by single mothers or women raising
children on their own because they have been divorced or widowed.
Household heads may also be widowed men with young children, though
their numbers are fewer as they are more likely to remarry. Elderly people,
either living alone or who are too old to work themselves but are taking care
of children who are in some way disabled, are also represented
disproportionately among very poor households.
During the social assessment, a very small number of household considered to
be "very poor" were interviewed (six such households were interviewed,
including both rural and urban households, of which 5 were urban or peri-
urban). However, of those six households, four had family members who
could described as mentally ill or mentally disturbed. One household
included a family member (the household head) who was physically disabled.
In two cases, the family well-being was affected by an ongoing illness in the
family; in one household the grandfather had been ill for many years, and in
the other a young mother who had been ill for five years had died and left her
husband with three young children to raise44.
A number of individuals interviewed in this category were very forthright in
stating that they wanted more assistance from the authorities (support from or
a permanent place in the aimag social care center, handouts of food and
money).
Better-off households in rural areas are characterized by strong family ties,
plentiful labor, good knowledge of local conditions, access to transport and

the group organization needed to make moves appropriate and advantageous
to each of the species of livestock herded. As stated in the previous chapter,
livelihood strategies of the better-off feature more frequent nomadic moves
over longer distances than poor households. Better-off herders are also more
likely to be able to reach markets where they can sell livestock products and
buy basic necessities at better prices. Among the better-off are also herders
who have focused on goat raising to take advantage of the high export prices
for cashmere. We interviewed several herders in Nariin Teel sum,
Ovorkhangai, who did not have particularly strong labor units or family ties
but nonetheless were doing well because of a decision made several years ago
to prioritize goat raising. They are now doing well because of the high price
they are able to obtain for the cashmere they produce.45. The better-off families
among the households we interviewed had from 300-400 head of livestock46.
Better-off herding households were typically older couples with some grown
children still at home and other children married and living in their own gers
but continuing to work together with their parents as an extended unit. There
may also be ties with relatives in settled areas.
No households we interviewed in this category spoke of wanting to increase
their herds. Rather, they were aiming to improve the quality of herds, and
thus the quality of livestock products, and/or to focus on species with high
commercial value.
Middle vulnerable herding households herd smaller numbers of their own
livestock (our interviews show herds of from 32-200) but may also herd
livestock for other people. Some of these households are now beginning to
organize themselves to work together in larger groups, especially following
the dzuds of the past two winters. Many households in this category also have
one or one or two household members receiving regular pensions or
allowances. This provides an important source of cash for purchasing basic
necessities. They may have their own transport, and some may hire transport
for nomadic moves or to enable them to take livestock products to more
central markets.
These households tend to be made up of married couples with children, some
of whom are old enough to begin helping with household and herding tasks.
They may also be older couples living with a son and his family.
Several households in this category had lost large animals in the dzud and this
was having adverse effects on household well-being (see section below)47. In
the near term they wished to raise more productive, larger animals to increase
products for household consumption (milk, cheeses) and supplies of cow

dung for fuel. This category of household also tends to have a keen interest in
working in larger associations in order to make better use of the available
pasture and build more advantageous trade networks.
Poor herding households do not generally have the means (labor, transport)
to graze their herds over long distances. Nor do they have herds, though, of a
size that would justify doing so. Instead they move within smaller areas,
keeping in close to settled areas. Those who have livestock are trading
livestock products directly for basic essentials with traders in nearby
settlements. Some poor herders we interviewed no longer had any livestock
and had begun staying in the same camp in all seasons; they were trying to
make a living though providing services to other herders or people in the sum
center (one was collecting and selling dung to households in the sum center;
another was occasionally herding for others and making bridles for sale)48.
Often households in this category have been hard hit by the dzud of the past
two years. Many said their main need at the moment is for assistance in
restocking, emphasizing that they did not want to have to stop herding as
they did not know how to do anything else. Also mentioned was support for
small-scale artisanal activities (for example del and boot making).
Among households in this category are young couples who have just
separated from their parents and are beginning to establish their own
households. Some single parent households can be counted in this category,
but not as many as one would expect to find in settled areas.
In our interviews we met only one woman who locals placed in the category
of a very poor rural household. She was an elderly woman living with her
adult daughter and granddaughter some 30km from Zuunkhangai sum center.
Her daughter was mentally ill, but was able to help the neighbors (mainly
spinning wool) who formed the same ail with her year -round. It appeared
that the 'work' given to the daughter was insignificant in itself but was a
tactful way for the neighbors to give food to the elderly woman's family
without it appearing to be entirely in the form of charity49. The family had had
several cows but they had been lost in the dzud last winter. Another daughter
in the sum center was receiving the old woman's pension for her and using it
to buy basic goods to bring up to the rural ger.50 Such households are more
likely to be found in settled or peri-urban areas.
Several households who had lost all livestock but were still living in rural
areas are categorized in the section above as "poor". It should be noted that
within the categories defined in the PLSA they would count as "very poor".
Our informants considered them to be "poor" because, although they had lost

all their livestock, they were still finding ways of making a living (and wanted
to restock) and were not living entirely off of charity and/or state support.
The social assessment did not have the opportunity to look into the livelihood
strategies of farming households. There are at least ten sum in the northern
part of Tov aimag, where people either have land or are employed by others,
and other places in the core aimags where agriculture, as opposed to herding,
is known to be the mainstay of rural livelihoods. These included the more
fertile valleys in Dornod aimag and Tarialan sum in Uvs aimag. In the areas
visited for the social assessment agriculture was only a supplementary part of
people's livelihoods. Small plots were being cultivating by people in settled
areas inside their khashaa compounds. Vegetables were grown to supplement
the family diet and were not for sale. There was a considerable amount of
interest shown both by local people and local officials to develop these small
plots.
2.5.2        Division of labor
The division of labor within herding households is divided along gender lines,
with men customarily undertaking livestock movements, haymaking,
shearing and other heavy manual work or activities done at a distance from
the camp such as trading livestock products. Domestic tasks, including
milking animals, cleaning and washing, caring for children, preparing food,
and processing milk and meat products, are customarily done by women.
However, a pragmatic approach is taken to these tasks: when the need arises,
both men and women will to take up tasks customarily carried out by the
opposite sex.
In settled areas small-scale family run businesses usually involve all members
of the family. Those who have salaried jobs are considered to be lucky to have
them, and it appears to be considered just as acceptable for a woman to hold
down a job outside of the home as a man. However, domestic work remains a
larger female domain, meaning that women may have a heavier workload as
they are expected to undertake domestic tasks on top of any other income
earning activities.
2.5.3        Availability of labor
For herders, the ideal is to have enough boys or men to herd animals in a way
that takes best advantage of the available pasture. Herders with insufficient
labor within their own ger may organize to work together with several other
ger to share labor. They may also seek assistance in herding from poorer
relatives or they may hire labor.
One way of freeing up labor for other activities is to herd in shifts. Several
herders pool their flocks and each herder is assigned a day to take them to
pasture; their labor is then freed up on their 'days off' for other tasks.

Many household demands for labor are seasonal and bottlenecks can be
created both in herding and domestic labor. One herder gave an example of
the types of situation that can place constraints on labor availability within the
household: Journeying to salt pans and milking mares both take place in the
summer months. The first requires the
labor of (usually) a young man, while      Box 5: Areas of herder collaboration in

camp while the others do otor.             Source: Centrefor Policy Research, 2001
Activities customarily carried out jointly by two or more households include
assistance with moving camp, making hay, shearing, and taking livestock to
salt pans. Members of newly formed herders' associations are beginning to
work more closely together on activities that were customarily shared in the
past, but also to overcome the weaknesses of individual households by
sharing a wider range of tasks (see box above).
In settled areas, problems of labor availability are the reverse of those
experienced in the countryside. While better-off herders strategize, and poorer
herders struggle to organize enough labor for herding, poor households in
settled areas suffer from a lack of employment or under employment - too
many people and not enough work. One strategy is to send older children
(usually boys) to help rural relatives with herding.
2.5.4         Incomes and productivity
There is a considerable difference between the incomes of households at the
top end of the socio-economic ladder and those at the bottom. Constructing a
comprehensive picture of household incomes is made difficult by the extent to
which households are involved in barter exchanges. However it is possible to
gain some idea of differences in household income by looking at the earnings
brought in by the main income generating activities of some households. In
the interviews conducted for the social assessment, they varied from six to
nine million MNT per year for trading activities52 down to 70 000 MNT per

another buying trip when stocks ran out. Actual income may be higher,

Earnings and expenses also vary significantly between households in the more
remote areas and those in the central provinces. This is due to price
differentials between the more remote and central areas, created by the high
costs of transport. For example, NSO data shows the cost of petroleum in
Bayan Olgii at 406 MNT per liter in 2000; in the same year in Tov aimag it was
360 per liter. Costs of electricity are from ten to eighteen MNT more in some
core aimags than they are in Ulaan Baatar. Prices of other goods are more
varied. This may have to do with differences in access to border markets.
Flour is relatively cheap in Uvs, for example, because of access to the Russian
market.
Prices herders are able to obtain for livestock products are much higher in the
central region. For example the price quoted for wool in Ovorkhangai were
100 MNT for 150 kg; in Tov the price was 200 MNT per kilo. Even price
differentials between Tov and the capital are quite high; skins sold in Ulaan

Baatar can earn 500 - 1000 MNT more per skin than if they are sold in Tov,
and wool is 20- 30 MNT higher than in Tov.

Processing also makes a difference to prices obtained for livestock products.
Wool in Tov sells for 200 MNT per kg but a pair of boots, which uses six kg of
wool, can sell for 6000 MNT in Ulaan Baatar. A trader selling raw skins in
Olgii capital claimed he could add 2-3000 MNT more to each skin he sells if he
could tan them and sell them on the Chinese market53.
Another feature of the economy in the core aimags is the extent to which
people rely on barter. Livestock products are often traded directly for basic
necessities. Pensions for many herding households are the only source of cash
income and for some, even this cash does not pass through their hands. In
Nariin Teel sum, Ovorkhangai aimag, it was found that herders had given their
pension or allowance cards to traders as a sort of credit guarantee. The trader
would hold the card as a way of ensuring that the full sum each month went
towards paying off the standing debt. Credit extended to herders from
traders who also deal in livestock products also amounts to an informal
contract for the purchase of goods - on the traders' terms. Indeed one herder
interviewed said he had an informal contract with one trader to buy his
cashmere in May when the cashmere is sheared. Upon further questioning it
became apparent that this trader had been supplying him with goods
(extending credit) throughout the year and he is obliged to take his cashmere
to this trade (and not another trader or a more central market where he might
obtain a better price) because he has a debt to repay54.

2.6          RESOURCE CONSUMPTION PA7rERNS
2.6.1        Spatial Nature of Resource Consumption Patterns
The social assessment was unable to obtain detailed information about the
livelihoods of farm households and therefore a comparison of differences
among nomads and farm households in managing livestock and grassland
ecosystems is not possible. However, herders' reports of problems they have
faced following the dzud give an indication of how they aim to achieve an
ecological balance between the grasslands, livestock and household needs.
Concern was expressed in several household where interviews were
conducted that, having lost many or all their cows during the dzud, they were
very short of dung and were having to look for other sources of fuel55.
2.6.2        Attitudes Towards Wildlife and Biodiversity Protection
Beliefs that man is a part of or subjected to nature are shared by Mongolians
and Kazakhs. A study of attitudes towards the environment conducted in the
early 1990s in twelve field sites across Inner Asia speaks of such attitudes
being based upon some key concepts: "Humanity is thought to depend on
external nature in a religious sense but also to be justified in acting within
nature to maintain its own ways of life." This results in sensitivities about how
to treat nature in some circumstances, and other circumstances in which it is
acceptable for man to intervene in nature56.
The time frame of the social assessment did not permit a fully fledged study of
these issues. However, it was clear that interdictions to the over-exploitation
of wildlife persist, and at times these are justified for reasons that could be
called 'religious'. A herder interviewed in Ovorkhangai said he had stopped
hunting (he used to hunt for marmots) because one of his parents had died;
one is not allowed to hunt for several years afterwards, he said, as a mark of
respect57. An older man in Uvs aimag gave a very practical example of how
cues taken from wildlife and the natural surroundings continue to be
important for herders' livelihoods. He spoke of how a harsh winter was
expected this year, because rodents had begun to store food much earlier that
usual (starting from June rather than August). He also implied that younger
generations are paying less attention and losing the ability to read these types
of clues from the environment58.
The social assessment team did not visit areas, however, where people spoke
of rodents as destructive to pasture and a nuisance to herders. In the district
visited in Ovorkhangai (which was in a Khangai area at the edge of the

steppe) it was said, however, that they pose a real threat in steppe areas
further south, which provides ideal conditions for burrowing59.
And while the idea that nature should not be exploited except when it is
needed for specific purposes also applied to hunting, the reality is somewhat
different. Fox hunting for sport remains a popular pastime among the Kazakh
in Bayan Olgii. Several herders in Mongol areas mentioned that they
undertook marmot hunting, which appeared to be as much for sport as for the
income gained from selling the skins. Wolf hunting, though, appears to be
only carried out for the purpose of protecting herds. In Nariin Teel sum a
reward was offered: each household within the bag gave one sheep to anyone
who shot a wolf. The hunter would first have to certify his kill with the local
authorities60.
The social assessment was unable to obtain adequate information to comment
meaningfully about attitudes towards biodiversity protection. It was
mentioned by a local government official in Ovorkhangai however that the
increase in rodents is due to a decrease in their natural predators from
hunting6l.
2.7           SOCIAL AND KINSHIP ORGANIZATION OF COMMUNITIES
2.7.1         Social organization
In rural areas, the ail is the basic unit of social organization. The ail is a
grouping of 2-5 ger who camp together and may, to different degrees, share
between them the tasks related to livestock raising. Blood ties often connect
the residents of one ger to other ger within the ail. Frequently an ail will consist
of the ger of older parents and those of several married children. Households
within an ail may camp together throughout the year, moving together from
season to season. Or, they may separate, forming different ail in different
seasons of the year. Ail in the gobi tend to be smaller than other places in the
country and often consist of a single household.
The equivalent of the ail in urban areas is the khashaa which refers to the
wooden fence erected around one or several gers or houses. Khashaa too are
often composed of households of blood relatives.
It was observed, however, that there is a tendency among very poor
households to stick together. Relations in particular between very poor
households in a single khashaa may be determined more by their common
plight than by any family ties.

2.7.2        Kinship
Patrilineal social organization is shared by the ethnic groups in the country.
Traditionally, this means that a son would stay near to his parents when he
married, and his bride would move away from her family to come and join
him. This is still frequently the case among herding families: other ail
members are usually the husband's family rather than the wife's. The eldest
son traditionally remains living with his parents after marriage and has the
responsibility of caring for them in old age. Again, this pattern continues to be
followed in the rural areas.
In settled areas, and particularly in aimag capitals, many people have moved
in the past for reasons of employment and residence patterns based on
patrilineal ties are much less readily adhered to.
Family connections have become increasingly important in the new economy
as one of the main networks of support. Because of the increased importance
of seeking opportunities through one's family, maternal family ties have also
gained in importance.
2.7.3        Urban-rural links
The main way people use their family connections is to link the urban
livelihood of one relative with the rural livelihood of another. This is usually
in the form of rural households herding animals for the urban household. It is
a largely successful strategy which allows people to compensate for the
weaknesses of both settled and rural livelihoods. Rural households are given
better access to the benefits of the settled area. Often, for example, children in
the rural household will live with the settled relatives while attending school.
The settled households will in turn benefit from a supply of meat and milk.
A couple interviewed in Zundelger bag, (Zuunmod sum, Tov aimag) were
herding a small number of their own livestock, as well as livestock belonging
to the husband's elderly parents living close by in the aimag center. The
herding households were sharing produce and profits from the combined
herd with their urban parents, but this was arranged on a very informal basis
- in effect the incomes of the two households had been merged62.
2.7.4        Newforms of collaboration - herders' associations
The social assessment team found that the development of 'herders'
associations' (or herders' NGOs, or collectives) were an active topic of
discussion among herding households and local authorities. Since the dzud,
many households have recognized the benefits of 'pooling their strengths'.
These ideas are modeled on traditional types of shared labor but also on the
joint activities undertaken in the collectives prior to the transition.. .without
the collective assets. Officials in Tov aimag said they were currently
encouraging herding households to come together in informal associations -

groups of from 15 to 20 households - to make better use of their combined
labor and skills for collective activities. In other aimags the same ideas were
being actively and enthusiastically discussed.
The social assessment team had the opportunity to meet with several groups
of herders who have begun to informally associate. One herders' NGO
assisted by the Center for Policy Research was visited in Erdene sum, Tov
aimag, and we also met with two other groups of herders who were beginning
to organize their work in larger groups63. The individuals who had initiated
these new forms of organization and are the informal leaders of these groups
tend to be experienced herders but are also forward thinking, entrepreneurial
individuals. They are particularly interested in improving their terms of trade
for livestock products. The informal leaders of ail groups tend to be senior
men, usually respected for their greater experience and knowledge of
livestock raising.
In the box below is a case study of one of the 'spontaneous' associations
encountered in the field research.
Text Box 6: A burgeoning herders' association in Omnogobi sum, Uvs aimag
Mr. Z. made a decision following the dzud last year to encourage his family and close friends to more
actively work together. A total of nine households, including those of his married children and three
close friends, have begun to organise a network for buying and selling goods. When anyone plans to
travel to the sum centre, he or she will now make the rounds of the other households to collect any
animal products for sale and take orders for supplies. The group also jointly makes hay, an activity
undertaken by the young men in the family while the older men tend the herds. The group does not
have its own transport but has collectively hired transport to take large loads to market and to collect
hay. Mr. Z. says that several informal groups like this have formed (or have begun to talk about
forming) in his bag since the dzud. He spoke of further plans to repair one disused well within the area
and to grow vegetables nearby. He felt all households in the group would benefit if the group
expanded to include more members. This, he anticipated, would create a stronger labour force, and
allow the group to separate herds by species for greater productivity. He was optimistic that herders
with fewer livestock could participate in these groups, as they have skills to offer besides herding.
Better-off herders are sometimes overstocked, he said, and can benefit from the help of others with
fewer assets for assistance with herding. He felt these groups could be supported by connecting with
agents in sum and aimag level, to have access to equipment information (weather forecasts, prices of
consumer goods and animal products), to buy necessary equipment and to have links with small
business enterprises to sell animal products. Sum authorities were very supportive of this and other
burgeoning groups and felt the groups had an important role to play in the economic development of
the area. The sum authorities felt these groups could be strengthened one step further by having their
own transport and taking goods to the aimag centre rather than selling in the sum.

While herders involved in newly formed herders' associations claimed poorer
herders could find a ready place in these associations, examples from herders
NGOs developed with support of the Center for Policy Research show that
there may be limitations in practice. Poorer households are more easily
accepted within these associations if they have skills that may be used or are
willing to learn new skills (for example, of the poorest members of CPR-
supported herders' NGOs, one has been re- trained as a carpenter, and
another was given training in boot making). 64
2.8          CAPACITY OF LOCAL INSTITrrTIONS
2.8.1        Formal and informal institutions
Several institutions can be expected to have important roles to play in the SLP.
The roles and responsibilities of these institutions, and their existing
relationships with local people will be significant in determining the extent to
which local beneficiaries are included in decision-making processes.
Governments at aimag, sum and bag levels are in charge of implementing
government programs. At aimag level this body consists of about 3040 staff.
Situated in the aimag capital, there is a natural tendency for the aimag
government to have greater contact with the government of the sum at aimag
center (whose offices are often situated nearby) than with more remote sums.
As a consequence, many sums at aimag centres are entrusted by the aimag
government with greater levels of responsibility than rural sums. Local
officials in Zuunmod sum (situated in Zuunmod town, the capital of Tov) told
us they are regularly charged with procurement of construction works and
payment of contractors. In rural sums these responsibilities tend to be carried
out by the aimags on behalf of their rural sums.
Discussions with sum leaders and other representatives of sum governments
indicated that their respective aimags make many of the key decisions on
investments in public infrastructure and services. Interestingly many sum
governors claimed this situation existed not so much because authority was
placed at the level above them but because there was simply not enough
financing coming down from aimag level (and little if any being raised locally)
to allow sum governments to execute the projects that they felt were urgent at
their own levels (see box below).

Text Box 7: Public Buildings in Zuunkhangai sum, Uvs aimag
The social assessment team were taken on a visit of public buildings in the sum centre. Several
buildings have been declared unsafe so that the local government, hospital and the 100 pupils who
board in the sum centre are all housed in wings of a building erected for use as a dornitory with a
capacity of 75 students. The hospital moved from another building into the dormitory when the
hospital building was condemned four years ago. The sum had two school buildings in service five
years ago, but one has since been condemned. The existing building is a two storey brick structure
erected in the mid 1980s. Built to hold 320 pupils, the school now services 600 pupils in two shifts.
The school building is seriously degraded with brick crumbling on two walls, and a concrete roof
that is mildewed and rotten and leaks continuously throughout the winter. Electric wiring runs
through the roof and walls and it has become too dangerous to use the lights in more than 3 rooms
of the building. Last year the sum received 5 million tugriks from the state budget for maintenance
of the building, but local officials claim that a major overhaul, which they budget at 40 million
tugriks, is needed to restore the building to a state in which it is safe for use. The school building
has been condemned by the inspection department but sum authorities say in the absence of any
alternative they must continue to use this building.
SA interviews 14/10/01
Sum governments are physically situated in the settlements found at sum
centres. Sums in the core aimags have jurisdiction over an average of five bags
or about 1000 households. The approaches of these leaders vis-a-vis the local
population varies. At the times during which the social assessment team was
accompanied by sum leaders to interviews, some showed themselves to be
talkers, frequently interrupting to speak on behalf of the person or persons
ostensibly being interviewed. Other, however, were good listeners, allowing
local people to explain in their own words their situation and keenly listening
themselves to what was being said.
On the whole, and despite their different approaches, sum leaders were very
concerned about the situation of poverty within their sums. Interestingly,
many perceived their own role, in light of the hardships of the last few years,
as one of protecting the populations within their sums from the excesses of the
free market; thus while they were strongly in support of establishing
marketing networks, better stocked local kiosks with more reasonable prices,
small-scale enterprises and banking systems, they often felt control of these
activities was better placed in the hands of local state authorities, who they felt
would be more inclined than private entrepreneurs to act in the interests of
the poor.
Bag level governors are key players connecting local people in rural bags to
sum level authorities. They have regular contact with the sum authorities and
visit the sum center frequently. In the core aimags a bag leader represents on
average just over 200 households and will know everyone within the bag by
name. Due to the scattered distribution of households within a given bag,
however, contact between bag leaders and those people who herd in more
remote areas may be infrequent. In the sums visited, bag leaders tended to be
younger than sum leaders.

Khurals are elected councils of citizens' representatives, present at national,
aimag, sum and bag levels. These councils have a long history, having existed
prior to the democratic reforms of 1990. Khurals nominate the governor at their
respective administrative levels (who is then appointed by the Prime
Minister), approve local budgets and are decision-makers on socio-economic
issues within their areas. Khural leaders met with in the field visits made clear
that they do not have a direct influence on the implementation of programs,
but have a role to play in monitoring and oversight of projects. In principle,
the khural should have more power than the government, but in practice the
government tends to hold more sway, not least because it is the body handling
public finance. The sum khural, which is the level likely to have the most
involvement in the project, is made up of a Presidium of 25 people elected by
the local community, which is divided into smaller working groups.
On the effectiveness of khurals, opinions appear to be divided. Some parties
claim that they do not hold much power but that the principle they represent
is important, with some suggestion that their powers should be gradually
increased. Others maintain the opposite, that khurals prevent local
governments from getting work done effectively by throwing obstacles in the
way of basic public works and program that should be uncontroversial. Both
views are probably true to some extent; it is to be expected that the
relationship of each khural to its respective government office is not going to
be the same everywhere. Indeed the relationships of the sum khural leaders
encountered during the field visits were by no means uniform vis-a-vis their
respective sum governments. In some cases khural leaders appeared to
function at a remove from local government (separate offices, separate
interviews with the social assessment team) and demonstrated a certain
amount of mistrust for local government. Other khural leaders appeared to
consider themselves very much a part of the sum government, and more
closely tied not just to the oversight of plans within the khural but to the
details of their execution. In this latter type of khural the khural leader is often
an older man acting as an elderly advisor.
Poverty Alleviation Council Secretaries are present at national aimag and sum
levels and have been responsible for the implementation of the National
Poverty Alleviation Program (NPAP). The PAC Secretary at aimag level is a
full-time position while sum PAC secretaries work part-time. Aimag and sum
governors chair the Poverty Alleviation Councils at their respective levels.
PAC secretaries, especially at aimag level, have heavy workloads. Even though
some aimag PAC secretaries have received jeeps to assist in their work under
the restocking projects, many claimed to have severely limited budgets for
operational costs and had found it difficult to carry out their responsibilities
effectively. Sum PAC secretaries have worked on a part-time basis for NPAP
but this work coupled with other part-time responsibilities (other obligations
usually include work on social welfare, social assistance or women's/youth
issues) has amounted to heavy workloads.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                            WORLD BANK

Several PAC secretaries both at aimag and sum levels claimed to receive
regular visits from members of the public, coming to seek assistance from the
poverty alleviation programs they had heard about. Frequently, they
complain about not having received any assistance. One aimag secretary was
clearly very upset about the amount of pressure these encounters place upon
him. He emphasized that many people within his aimag are in very poor and
desperate situations. He has frequently found himself in a situation where he
does not have a direct and immediate solution to the problems of individuals
who seek his help, but he has on occasion been accused of receiving money for
poverty alleviation but not using it on the poor, and is made to feel personally
responsible for the problems faced by these households.
A high turnover of staff within government bodies following elections has
been one feature of the change to a multi-party political system. This is true of
local governments, khurals, and Poverty Alleviation Councils. There were few
government officials interviewed during the field visits whose term in office
extended beyond the previous election. Consequently, while they had an
understanding of previous programs such as NPAP, they had little first hand
experience of incorporating the 'lessons learned ' from these programs. In
addition some said they felt the performance-based nature of NPAP had
penalized them. In some sums it was maintained that funding was being
directed away from the sum because of the poor performance of NPAP loans
in the sum and sum officials felt that they were (unfairly) having to bear the
consequences of the poor results achieved by the previous administration.
Women's and Youth Federations are represented in every aimag center with
branches at sum level. Some representatives exist at bag level, though their role
is not institutionalized and coverage at bag level is not comprehensive. The
federations existed prior to the reform period but have adopted a more
independent role in the last decade. Members work voluntarily, with funds
coming into the federations on a project-by-project basis. The main aims of the
Women's Federation are to promote women's skills development, to
disseminate information vital to women's interests and well-being, and to
promote woman's participation in the decision-making process. The Youth
Federation aims in similar ways to support the interests of young people.
The Women's Federation appeared to be quite active in the core aimags visited,
both with current programs and plans for the future. In Uvs aimag they
manage a range of activities, from work within NPAP on skills training for
women and administration of the women's development fund, to involvement
in encouraging the promotion of women to public and professional offices at
sum level, and in a campaign during the last election to encourage the
candidacies of women running for aimag and national level offices. They have
also instigated a program of reproductive health information to sum and bag
level. Most of these activities appear to be co-ordinated from aimag or national
level.

2.9          PROJECT RELEVANT CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS ELEMENTS
2.9.1        Ethnicity
Points directly relevant to the project are summarized here from the longer
analysis in the preceding section II B.
Differences in livelihoods between the ethnic groups in the core aimags are
too minor to warrant distinct approaches in the project design for different
ethnic groups; the design of the project, which allows for much of the final
decision-making on component details to be made at more local levels, should
allow for the preferences of ethnic groups to be met. Among the Kazakh a
number of such preferences were mentioned including efforts to address the
living conditions of very poor households returned from Kazakhstan; and
support for cultural centres and libraries. It would be possible for Kazakh
groups to choose to address these issues using funding from LIF.
In the core aimags, all ethnic groups speak mutually comprehensible dialects,
barring the Kazakh. While local authorities speak and work in Mongolian,
many local people do not speak or read Mongolian. Their access to project
information would be restricted were it only distributed in Mongolian.
Social indicators do not currently provide enough information about ethnic
groups to give us a full picture of areas in health or education that might be
relevant to a specific ethnic group. However aimag level data showing high
maternal mortality in Bayan Olgii, warrants further studies into the reasons
for this as an input into any health related activities in that province under the
SLP.
While the points 1-3 above outline areas where the project design can be
adjusted to better meet the needs of ethnic groups in the core aimags, no ethnic
beliefs or customs were identified that might actually conflict with or be
adversely affected by the project activities.
2.9.2        Religion
Religious beliefs and practices are relevant to the project primarily in that
some knowledge of them adds to a general understanding of the project
context. It is not anticipated that the project, as currently designed, would
disrupt or conflict with these beliefs and practices.
Populations within the core aimags mainly practice a mixture of Buddhist and
shamanist beliefs. The Kazakh are Islamic.
Buddhist beliefs tend to be stronger in central parts of the country (though
they have also been influenced by the shamanistic practices that preceded
them historically) whereas shamanistic practice tends to predominate over
Buddhist practices in the peripheral areas of the country65. Buddhism, which
(65) see Humphrey and Sneath, 1999,30.

was severely repressed during the communist years, has experienced a revival
since 1990. Shamanistic beliefs are traditionally based on ideas of spirits of
place or ancestors believed to be present in a certain location or natural
feature. Thus there is an important connection between shamanistic beliefs
and attitudes towards nature.
As compared to countries where definitions of 'proper' Islam have been
pushed to the forefront of political debate, the Kazakh tend to practice a very
moderate form of Islam. As observed in the section IIB, Islam as practiced by
the Kazakh does not place severe restrictions on women in their daily life,
although there may be a tendency for women, more than men, to be
encouraged to identify with, and remain within, the Kazakh community.
Several generations of Mongolians have now undergone an atheist education
(from the 1920s through to the 1980s) and urban Mongols in particular do not
necessarily attach religious significance to many practices that were once
religious in significance. Practices such as leaving a stone at an ovoo (the large
stone piles which one encounters frequently on the Mongolian landscape) as
one passes are practiced by many people nowadays out of force of habit,
rather than for spiritual reasons.
Traditionally, many shamanistic beliefs are centered around the ovoo, but this
is now syncretised in many areas with Buddhist beliefs so that these are sites
of both Buddhist and shamanistic practices. Ovoos were notably absent from
Kazakh areas of Bayan Olgii.
Ovoos are the main sacred sites that may be relevant to the SLP. Others are
Turkic stones (some in the shape of human figures; others stelae covered with
writing or primitive drawings) dotted around the landscape; several remain in
Uvs and Bayan Olgii but they may also be found in other aimags, particularly
in the western part of the country. Many of these were destroyed during the
revolutionary period 66 but those that remain, although their original
significance is blurred in history, remain important markers on the landscape.
Activities currently planned under the SLP do not pose a threat to such sites.
With a revival of traditional beliefs and the importance to local people of such
sites in the 1990s, local people are unlikely to decide to willingly plan projects
(for e.g. under LIF) that would threaten such sites. If pasture use did not
remain common it might restrict access to such sites, but this is unlikely as
herders were be more concerned with controlling access to grazing resources
than access to other features on the landscape.
Other sacred sites in the project areas are Buddhist temples and stupas (bogd)
and Islamic mosques. Mosques tend to be situated in or near to settled areas
in Bayan Olgii. Buddhist sites may be found both in settled and rural areas.
Again, for projects planned at local levels there is little risk to these sites from
the SLP. Conversely restrictions on using LIF money for religious purposes

already answers to the concern that project money might be used to build
such sites.
2.10         STAKEHOLDERS PERCEPTIONS OF THE PROJECT AS TENTATIVELY PLANNED
This section gathers together views expressed by local government officials
and beneficiaries during discussions with the social assessment team about
the planned Sustainable Livelihoods Project. Critical areas where views
mentioned were not in line with planned SLP project designs are highlighted:
2.10.1       Pastoral Risk Management
Land possession certificates: Discussions with PAPO and MoFA
representatives indicated that they do not wish to see the issuance of
possession certificates for pasture land included in the SLP (see section II DI).
Herders' associations: Keen interest was expressed both by herders and local
governments for providing support for herders' associations. Local authorities
stated though that the actual formation of the groups was an area in which
they did not see a role for itself. Rather, they felt they should play and an
institutional support for groups that had formed on their own initiative.
Varying levels of support for restocking activities: There was widespread
support among herders who had lost many livestock in the previous two
years of dzud, for further support for restocking. Many had not been part of
the previous restocking projects but felt that this support was critical as
herding was the only way they knew how to make a living. To date,
restocking activities have not reached all herders who lost livestock in the last
dzud but do not wish to move out of herding and would like to be included in
the restocking program (see Section II E 1). Government is not so supportive
of the activity: a representative of MoFA informed us that the ministry would
like restocking to be kept to a minimum under the SLP as it is a loan-based
activity and therefore risky67.
Local participation in restocking projects: One sum government official felt
the selection process for restocking had not worked well in the past in his sum.
He claimed some of those households whose names were put forward by the
sum to benefit from restocking were not selected in bag level meetings - these
were some of the poorer households and the sum governor put this down to
the fact that people tended to support their relatives in the vote, thus it was
those people who had strong kin networks who tended to receive the benefits.
He felt this could be corrected in the new project by continuing to conduct a
bag level meeting, but placing the final decision about restocking beneficiaries
with sum authorities68.

2.10.2       Local Initiative Fund
LIF and existing government development plans: Government officials at
every level were concerned that activities implemented under the Local
Initiative Fund should be in line with existing government development
plans. The extent to which these plans might conflict with or be allowed to
overturn local preferences remains unclear. It also begs the questions of
whether the final decisions for certain types of activities under LIF (social
services) can realistically be placed at local levels.
Local Infrastructure and decentralization: While most sum leaders felt that
more control of decision-making at local levels would be an advantage, it was
pointed out that obstacles in improving local infrastructure are not only a lack
of decision-making power at local levels, but also a lack of sufficient financing
to properly address basic problems within the sums (Section II H 1).
Existing Local Initiatives: The social assessment team were introduced to a
number of small-scale initiatives developed in sums by local governments and
local people to try to take advantage of local resources and find solutions to
immediate local problems. Sum officials were keen to secure further funding
for these initiatives. Activities were very basic, they made a great difference to
many people in the community. Some examples include: helping a widower
with three young children to get transport to pastures where he could pick
grasses to make brooms; encouraging women headed households who had
lost their livestock to collect dung, and buying it to fuel local government
buildings; organizing poor households in the sum settlement to divide old co-
operative fields into individual plots of land and bring them back under
cultivation to grow vegetables to supplement their diet; and finding
accommodation for unemployed families. Similar initiatives being planned or
discussed included construction or rehabilitation of housing for the poor (this
was mentioned in Bayan Olgii as a pressing need for returnees from
Kazakhstan), and the construction of local cultural centres and libraries. Sum
and bag leaders are often the motivating forces behind such activities, in
seeking out and providing small-scale opportunities and encouragement to
poorer households. Currently there is either no funding or small amounts of
money from the sum budget to support these types of initiatives; with support
from LIF these could become viable local projects that make a big difference to
poor households in the community.
Adequate budgets: Sum leaders pointed out that some of the infrastructure in
their sums is so degraded that major reconstruction is needed; currently
amounts they received from their aimag are enough to cover only basic
maintenance and they hope that funds available under SLP may be able to
cover some of these more major works (Section II H 1).

64



2.10.3       Micro-credit
Loans, jobs and the very poor: There is widespread recognition that loans
extended to very poor households under the NPAP project were not a success
either for the borrowers (who circumstances obliged them to spend loans on
consumption rather than investments), nor the lender (local authorities have
had great difficulties ensuring repayment). There was general agreement in all
areas where social assessment interviews were conducted, that target groups
for loans should be the able-bodied or productive poor, and middle-income
families, and that loan sizes need to be big enough to allow investors to create
businesses which could offer jobs to the unemployed in settled areas (section
II E 1).
2.10.4       Project Management
State vs. private sector: Some sum and aimag leaders favored continued state
control and management over many project initiatives (examples included
micro-credit, haymaking, establishment of marketing networks), claiming that
the state had a responsibility to protect local people from unscrupulous
private entrepreneurs. This attitude was most prevalent in areas remote from
the central region, where private traders have a strong hold on the local
economy (see II E 1).
Delegation of responsibilities: Government officials at aimag and sum levels
expressed concern that responsibilities cannot be easily transferred from one
institutional actor to another - or one administrative level to another - unless
the newly responsible party is also given responsibility for the outcome of the
activity. This issue arose both in discussing the possibilities of giving the
khurals a more prominent role in the project, and turning microfinance
operations over to a microfinance institution. PAC secretaries were
particularly concerned that responsibilities are clearly assigned.
Workloads of PAC secretaries: Several PAC secretaries remarked on their
heavy workloads under NPAP and so were pleased to have agricultural
departments more directly involved in implementation of project components
under SLP.
2.11         STAKEHOLDERS' SUCCESS INDICATORS
Stakeholders definitions of 'success' are broad ranging and sometimes extend
beyond the bounds of the project. However this reflects the numerous possible
activities that might be taken up under all three components. Key indicators
beneficiaries would use to judge the success of the SLP include:
* Reduced losses during dzud, especially among poorer households;
* More rational distribution of livestock on the landscape in central regions,
reducing conflict;
* Better preparation in case of dzud;

* For some poor herders, option available to continue herding through
restocking support;
* Changes in herder behavior, with herders benefiting from working
together on some activities in larger units; government incentives to
support this changed behavior;
* Reduction in the costs of basic necessities in remote regions
* More reasonable prices obtained for livestock products, especially in
remote regions;
* Herders and local people able to process and enjoy value added from
livestock products;
* Jobs created in settled areas;
* Housing made available to poor in settled areas69;
* Good quality infrastructure constructed that will require only basic
maintenance in coming years.

3            CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Overall, social impacts are expected to be positive, with no severe adverse
social costs anticipated.
3.1          TARGETING
3.1.1        Social Impacts and Project Risks
Some of the very poorest households (those with adults too old to work, or
mentally or physically unable to do so) are not expected to benefit from
certain SLP activities. This is openly acknowledged in project documents.
GoM intention is to maintain and develop the system of social welfare, outside
of the SLP, to provide appropriate and much-needed assistance to this group
of households.
The social assessment has found that many of the very poorest households
continue to have welfarist expectations of government. Previous projects have
very publicly targeted 'poor households', but have not provided handouts,
and in so doing have put undue pressure on PAPO officers. It will be
important to continue to maintain, in information transmitted to the public in
relation to the Sustainable Livelihoods Project, that the project is intended to
address sustainable livelihoods, and not the alleviation of poverty through
direct assistance to the very poorest households. This should help to ensure
that expectations match what the SLP is able, and intended, to deliver.
Nonetheless, a broader range of people can be expected to benefit from some
project activities than those groups explicitly targeted by the project. For some
activities, this includes the very poorest households.

Although the interests of the better-off sometimes run in opposition to the
interests of the poor, the livelihood strategies of better-off households should
be supported within the project where these are of benefit to poorer
households. In settled areas in remote sum and aimag centres, many better-off
households rely for their livelihoods on profits made on the considerable price
differentials between the margins and the center. They do not currently have
the means to finance the types of productive activities that might generate
employment for those lower down the socio-economic ladder. Likewise, some
livelihood strategies of better-off herders, for example in seeking additional

labor for herding or milking, may also provide support to poorer herding
households.
As long as special measures are taken to facilitate access of households
defined as "able bodied" to some types of project activities (recommendations
are made later in this chapter) the broader spread of benefits as depicted in
Table 9 should be viewed positively, underlining as it does the fact that the
more secure and better-off households have a role to play in building
sustainable livelihoods.
3.1.2        Recommendations
As regards poverty targeting the following recommendations are made:
* Broaden the stated target groups for SLP so they include all groups implicitly
included in project documents. Target groups would therefore include herding and
settled corn7nunities in rural anid peni-urban areas, with a focus onf the able bodied
poor and low-income households vulnerable to impoverishment and economic
shock.
* Ensure that public information campaigns transmit clearly, throughout the life of
the project, the message that the SLP is intended to improve the livelihoods of
poorer households, but is not a program of government handouts.
3.2           COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION
3.2.1         Social Impacts and Project Risks
Procedures that are kept as straightforward and clear as possible are most
likely to ensure the informed participation of beneficiaries.,
Implementation steps for decision-making are currently very detailed
(especially in LIF) but there is a risk that the demands of herders' lives might
make it difficult for them to be able or willing to participate in a heavy
schedule of meetings related to project activities. Moreover, people proved to
be very open in expressing their views and opinions during interviews for the
social assessment and it may not be necessary to closely define how the
meetings are going to take place.
Other arrangements that are equally important to ensuring local involvement
in project activities include levels of local contribution required from
beneficiaries, and their obligations regarding maintenance of works built
under the project. Basic guidelines and procedures for these aspects need to be
more firmly defined to ensure beneficiaries are aware of their rights and
obligations.
Of particular concern are discrepancies between LIF and PRM in the local
contributions they require. Local communities are called upon to contribute
10% of total project investment under the LIF, but 20% under PRM. In
addition, contributions under LIF are unclear. Whereas in some passages of
PIP it is stated that local contributions to LIF consist of 5% local government
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                                 WORLD BANK
69



and 5% people's labor or in-kind contribution, other passages in the same
document suggest that the 10% consists entirely of local people's
contributions. These levels of contribution are likely to be too high for poorer
households, particularly if they are expected to contribute in cash, taken the
degree to which barter is relied upon in rural economies. But in addition,
expressing local contributions in percentage terms obscures the point of
requesting local contributions in the first place: if local contribution are
intended to demonstrate local communities' commitment to a project, then
contributions should be negotiated not as a percentage of investment, but on a
case by case basis as an agreement between beneficiaries and local authorities
about what they are able and willing to contribute. Percentages of total
investment are awkward to calculate at grassroots level, and local people are
more likely to agree upon what types of labor and what types and quantities
of materials they are able to contribute rather than to sit down and calculate
whether this meets 10% of total investment. Requiring these contributions to
be translated into percentages also creates an extra burden for administrators
in reporting project progress.
Maintenance is another area in which local people require clear information
about their responsibilities. PIP already adequately describes which parties
will be responsible for maintenance of different project activities, but more
work could be done to clarify and standardize maintenance agreements for
use between local authorities and local people. A triangular arrangement,
where a contract is signed between local government, users of the
infrastructure, and one local person charged with day-to-day maintenance,
was an arrangement that proved to be popular with many people - both
authorities and local people - interviewed for the social assessment.
Public information dissemination is already budgeted for. This can be
expected to play a key role in ensuring the informed participation of the
project beneficiaries, in informing them through radio broadcasts of their
rights and obligations regarding decision-making, contributions and
maintenance agreements, and also in providing them with information on
individual project activities through public postings.
3.2.2         Recommendations
Recommendations for strengthening community participation in project
activities are as follows:
Simplify the steps for implementing project activities at local levels (especially as
regards the LIF - see recommendations below): ensure, on the one hand, that
elements essential to local people's informed participation are clearly defined and
not subject to misinterpretation, but on the other hand, that steps in PIP related to
participation are not over-designed.
* Include steps in PIP for public meetings to take place, but leave it up to local people
in each situation to determine how many meetings are necessary and practicable,
and how these publicforums are to take place.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                                 WORLD BANK
70



* Clarify and simplify procedures for beneficiary contributions: do away with the
system of determining local contributions as a percentage of total investment and
replace it with agreements, negotiated locally between benefiting parties and the
local authorities, about the types of labor and locally available materials
beneficiaries are able to contribute.
* Establish uniform proceduresfor maintenance agreements between beneficiaries
and local authorities. These could consist of three-way contracts between local
government, groups using thefacilities (in some situations these may be herders'
associations) and one individual holding primary responsibilityfor maintenance.
* Ensure information is posted publicly (at sum government offices) informing
people of project informationfor all project activities (not just LIF), but keep these
simple and low cost (a sign informing the public of the implementation of the
activity under SLP, including a breakdown of monies availablefor and spent on
each activity, completion dates, and responsible parties). In Kazakh speaking sums
these posters should be posted in Kazakh language.
* Include the arrangements recommended above as basic content of the radio
information campaign.
3.3           PASTORAL RISK MANAGEMENT
3.3.1         Social Impacts and Project Risks
The set of grazing management activities aimed at improved grazing
discipline and practice, including surveys of existing land use, mapping of
pasture types, strengthening of joint local govemment and community efforts
to regulate and negotiate land use during drought and dzud, and the
community-based establishment of inter-sum otor reserves should have
positive effects on existing strategies. Currently, land use negotiations as they
pertain to preparations for drought and dzud are of greater interest to
households with larger numbers of livestock, higher demands for pasture, and
the means to seek out the more distant, better quality pastures. The strategies
available to poorer households (restricting livestock movements within closely
prescribed areas, camping close to settlements) mean that they are not
generally in competition with the better-off households for the more remote
pastures. However, better control of out-of-season grazing on less remote
pastures will be of more general benefit. Those herders whose livestock
movement patterns are more restricted will benefit more fully from grazing
management activities when other circumstances (the growth of their herds
and/or their labor force, better access to transport, etc.) enables them to carry
out more distant livestock movements.
Herders who are currently involved in the more traditional labor sharing
activities (such as herding in shifts, jointly organizing otor and haymaking) are
most likely to be at the forefront of forming herders' associations. It can be
expected that better-off herders will be the first to benefit from these activities,
but also that they will play important roles as leaders and initiating forces in
herders' associations.
ENvIRONMENTAL RESoURcES MANAGEMENT                                  WORLD BANK
71



There are already burgeoning herding groups in several provinces, and local
governments, NGOs and research and aid projects assisting and encouraging
the formation of this type of association. These are all of help as models for the
project. Nevertheless there is a risk that 'herders' associations' could, within
the project context, become groups created solely as channels for receiving
SLP funding; a few group leaders will reap the benefits before project funding
is finished and the group dissolves. In this regard, lessons must be
incorporated from the 'Vulnerable Groups Organizations' (VGOs) formed
under NPAP. The development of herders' associations must be encouraged
in keeping with the principle that organizational forms developed through the
initiative of the members themselves and with their own shared purpose are
the strongest and most enduring.
Although it is possible for herders with no livestock or little herding (male)
labor to find a place in such organizations, it will be more difficult for poorer
households who are perceived as being unmotivated or poorly skilled to join.
Special measures will be required to find a place for them in such associations.
For poorer herders with some skills, this may consist of a simple introduction
and encouragement; for poor herder households with more deep-rooted
reasons for their poverty, relationships will be more difficult to establish and
may require the assistance of a mediator with skills in social work.
PRM activities need to remain accessible both to herders' groups and
individual herders in order to ensure that project benefits are not unevenly
distributed in favor of the better-off in the early stages of the project and that
misplaced incentives are not created to form herders groups simply for the
purpose of receiving project benefits.
It is not clear the allocation of "land possession certificates" or long term use
rights for pasture would be in the collective interest of herders, particularly
poorer herders. Both LSPO and MoFA , in discussions with the social
assessment team, stated that they are moving very slowly on this sensitive
issue and did not wish to see it included in the PRM activities for SLP.
The impact of pest control activities and control of wolf populations are more
environmental than social in their impact and have already been described in
the Environmental Assessment.
Measures proposed under the PRM component to provide greater security
against animal theft are vital in particular to herders in the sums of Uvs aimag
bordering the Russian republic. Herders in these areas are among the poorest
herders in that province, as those who remain are without the means to move
elsewhere. Better security is a prerequisite for being able to take advantage of
other activities under the Pastoral Risk Management component.
Winter preparation activities including (re)-construction of animal shelters,
and improved supplies of hay and fodder to protect against dzud should be of
general benefit to herding households. For poorer herders in particular,
strategies allowing them to produce as much of their own hay as possible,
ENVIRONMENTAL REsouRCEs MANAGEMENT                              WORLD BANK
72



and/or to purchase hay produced locally at more affordable prices, is of
added benefit.
The rehabilitation of wells and water sources will be more beneficial initially
to herders with the ability to carry out otor over longer distances, as the wells
in question tend to be in more remote pastures. Poorer households are often
poor for the very reason that they do not have the means to reach such
pastures.
Restocking programs are directly beneficial to poor households in helping
them to re-build their livelihoods following harsh winters. It was repeatedly
mentioned by herders who had suffered severe livestock losses during the
dzud that herding was the only way they knew how to make a living, and
restocking was therefore the most direct answer to their current problems.
Although attention is needed to ensure benefiting households receive healthy
and good quality stock, the risk of this activity being misdirected to middle-
income and better-off households is minimal; with livestock purchased locally
from better-off herders to supply the program, the benefits are mutual. In
addition, the redistribution of livestock locally prevents further grazing
pressure on pastures, and receiving households are acquiring breeds adapted
to local conditions. However, while poor herders view the programs as largely
beneficial, MoFA expressed reservations in discussion with the social
assessment team and expressed a wish to restrict the amount of SLP funding
available to restocking activities, preferring instead to focus on other PRM
activities. MoFA holds that, as the restocking programs are essentially a loan,
this places MoFA at risk if subsequent dzud are experienced, animals are lost
and the loans extended cannot be repaid.
Finally, PRM activities can also be expected to impact households living in
settled areas who own livestock. Households who 'place' livestock with rural
friends or relatives will indirectly benefit from the PRM activities in areas
where their livestock are placed. As very poor households in settled areas are
less likely to own livestock, this has a greater effect on the middle-income and
better-off households. However, settled households who keep their livestock
in or near the sum center have very restricted pasture areas available for their
use, and have not reportedly been beneficiaries to date of any restocking
projects, even though many of these households may have moved to the sum
centres because they lost all animals in the dzud of the last two winters.
Households in settled areas who own livestock also have needs for support in
pastoral management and these needs will not be met if PRM activities are
implemented only in rural bags.
3.3.2        Recommendations
The analysis of the social impacts of the Pastoral Risk Management
component suggests that the more secure and better-off herders will be the
first to benefit from many of the activities. It should not be understood though
that they are an 'elite' who threaten to 'capture' the benefits for themselves or
that the activities are therefore inappropriate for poorer households. Rather it
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                                WORLD BANK
73



is an indication that the more secure households are already at the forefront of
strategies to improve their livelihoods that are similar to those proposed.
In order to ensure the inclusion of poorer herding households in pasture risk
management activities; it is recommended to:
* Seekfinancefor social work training to enable a member of sum local government
(most likely in the social welfare and service center) to act as a community social
worker to assist the poor in gaining access to herders' associations, as well as
ensuring they benefitfrom other PRM activities.
Grant funding could be sought for this training. Responsibilities of the
community social worker within PRM would include: i) acting as an agent to
ensure poor herders inclusion at bag meetings on land use planning (some
exclude themselves from these meetings because they consider their use of
pasture is insignificant) and ii) assisting poor herders to gain access to herders'
associations on a case-by-case basis, based on an extensive work with poor
households and a full understanding of their circumstances. Community
social worker's proposed responsibilities under other components are
mentioned further down.
To ensure the formation of herders' associations that are enduring and
meaningful organizations it is recommended to:
a Develop a program of incentives to encourage herders to work together in larger
units.
Incentives might include reductions on winter leasing fees for households
who agree to share haymaking areas or who divide herds for grazing, tax
breaks on vehicles with joint ownership, etc.. The finer details of group
composition, such as group size, should not be defined in the project
implementation manual, but determined by herders themselves. Needs will
vary and every association/NGO/co-operative should not be expected to be
identical.
Publicity about herders' associations - the advantages of association, and the
experiences of successfully operating associations aimed at spreading interest - should
be one of the main topics covered in public radio broadcasts.
Information broadcasts should be developed together with other
organizations working to encourage the development of herders' associations
(Center for Policy Research, GTZ).
In addition it is recommended to:
* Fully tap the potentialfor improving pasture management though strengthening
systems of negotiation between local authorities and local people.

* Avoid becoming involved in the issuance of possession certificates for pasture to
either individuals or groups.
* Seek supportfrom securityforces to resolve the security problems in areas along
the northern border, and to defend the livelihoods of herders in these areas not only
in times of dzud, but throughout the year.
* Include households in sum centres in restocking activities in special cases. Those
herders who have moved to sum centres but wish to return to herding should be
eligible for restocking.
3.4           LOCAL INITIATIVE FUNDS
3.4.1         Social Impacts and Project Risks
The LIF as proposed is a fund which would allow for "demand-driven social
investments" to be financed with an 'open' menu of activities. It is necessary to
speculate on how the finances might be spent in order to comment on how the
LIF might benefit the project population. There seem to be three broad
categories of possible investment.
The first possible area of investment is in basic social services (including
education and health infrastructure and services). Despite some recent
improvements, sums visited in the SA were clearly working with insufficient
funds to keep basic social services running properly. There is a widespread
need for further financing for basic public infrastructure, both for minor
repairs and major rehabilitation/reconstruction. Improvements in health and
education services could bring benefits to the beneficiary population in
general, and, if these include strengthening of targeted services, to groups
with specific needs (health outreach to more remote rural bags, strengthened
women's reproductive health services, outreach to herding boys to enroll them
and keep them in school, etc.).
However, sum government officials view decentralization of responsibility for
social services and infrastructure to their level (and more local levels) as only
one of a number of pressing priorities, including sufficient funding to rebuild
structures in serious states of disrepair (rather than only having budgets for
maintenance). Currently the only sum governments involved in contracting
and procurement are those located in aimag centres, due to the difficulty for
rural sums of coordinating this over long distances. Moreover, no directives
have been put in place by GoM to date to decentralize powers to more local
levels, meaning there is little for the project to begin building on in this area.
Overall, the LIF appears to be a very complex and ambitious component,
taken both the very basic public infrastructure needs in the country, and the
current very preliminary discussions about decentralization in Mongolia.
Public works would be a second potential area for investment. This includes
maintenance of feeder roads and repair of bridges, improvement of water
supply systems, rubbish collection, and sanitation services. In one sum visited
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                                  WORLD BANK
75



it was understood that finance for these works should come from the sum
budget but the sum does not receive adequate financing to cover these
activities .., so they simply do not happen. Again these are basic services which
would have widespread benefits for the communities.
To this second category could also be added a number of 'environmental
projects', mentioned in the Environmental Assessment. These include solid
waste management, tree planting, promotion of renewable energy sources
(solar panels and wind electricity generators for herders), sewage treatment
facilities, community environmental education and training, and income
generation from the production and sale of herbs and preparations for
traditional human and livestock medicine
The third area for possible LIF investment is harder to describe as it
encompasses a number of very small-scale activities, but fits well the
description of "local initiatives". It includes a number of activities (or small
projects) witnessed during the field visits that sum and bag officials were
undertaking in conjunction with local people, to try to take advantage of local
resources and find solutions to immediate local problems. Although very
basic, they made a great difference to many people in the community.
Activities included helping a widower with three young children to get
transport to pastures where he could pick grasses to make brooms;
encouraging women headed households who had lost their livestock to collect
dung, and buying it to fuel local government buildings; and organizing poor
households in the sum settlement to divide old co-operative fields into
individual plots of land and bring them back under cultivation to grow
vegetables to supplement their diet. It could also include the construction or
rehabilitation of housing for the poor (this was mentioned in Bayan Olgii as a
pressing need for returnees from Kazakhstan), and the construction of local
cultural centres and libraries. Sum and bag leaders are often the motivating
forces behind such activities, in seeking out and providing small-scale
opportunities and encouragement to poorer households. Currently there is
either no funding or small amounts of money from the sum budget to support
these types of initiatives; with support from LIF these could become viable
local projects that make a big difference to poor households in the community.
There is a risk that this type of local initiative, though of great help to poorer
households, would not be eligible for LIF funding as it might be interpreted as
falling in the category of 'income generating projects for private households'.
The PIP suggests that bags will elect several committees responsible to
prioritize, plan, implement, manage and maintain project activities. On the
implementation level, local people are more likely to benefit if steps and
organizational structures are simplified in order to make their rights and
obligations crystal clear, and to reduce any unnecessary burden on the already
heavy workloads of local people. Public meetings already take place at bag
level; they bring together household heads to discuss and agree on a number
of different issues. It appears that people are comfortable to speak freely and
express their opinions at these meetings, although very poor households often
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                            WORLD BANK
76



experience social problems and it may be very difficult for them to express
their views at public meetings. Rather than replace this with new
organizational structures, it may be best to retain the current system, with
some provisions added to improve the extent to which women's voices and
the voices of the poor and other special interest groups are included in project
proposals. A network of women's and youth federations is already in place
and could play a key role in ensuring local views are incorporated into plans
for public spending both at higher levels and at local levels.
There is a further risk that decision-making for the LIF will not work in
practice the way it is described in the PIP, and this may lead to difficulties
during project implementation. There is a lack of clarity as to how local
people's choices would be 'harmonized' with local development plans if
higher level authorities do not have the right to refuse local level proposals.
3.4.2        Recommendations
Decisions need to be made about what types of activities are acceptable under
the community investment fund, while keeping these fund untied'. The
means by which local people participate in the project cycle also need to be
concretely defined.
A less ambitious design for the component than that proposed in PIP is likely
to achieve greater success. Decentralization should not be promoted simply
for its own sake: there is a need to distinguish between activities for which it is
appropriate and necessary for local people, and bag and sum administrators to
take responsibility, and those activities for which responsibility is best placed
with the aimag level.
Recommendations regarding the piloting of the LIF and the continuing LDF
are as follows:
l Retain the LDF tofinance public infrastructure and social services, managedfrom
aimag level, and sum level where it is practical to have the sum involved in
contracting and procurement, while emphasizing the increased involvement of
local people in decision-making processes.
* Sums in or near to aimag centres may be in a position to organize
procurement and contracting, but in more remote sums it is more
appropriate for these to be handled at aimag level.
• Use the LIF to institute local initiatives (i.e. those not connected with the work of
line ministries) managed by sum level.
An appropriate menu of activities would include public works, environmental
projects and the type of local initiatives mentioned in the previous section.
None of these activities currently receives funding from the center. In this
way, the LIF functions as a top-up fund for sums unable to raise enough local
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                                WORLD BAIK
77



finance to see local initiatives realized, with the eventual aim of sums being
able to finance these initiatives with locally raised funds.
At least for the first phase of SLP it is recommended to:
* Hold offon bag managed projects, which are too ambitious at this stage but may
becomefeasible later on; allow these activities to be managed by the sum andfocus
at bag level on strengthening systems of public information dissemination and
publicforums and meetings to include people in the decision-making process.
In addition:
* Realistically, sum PACs (or aimagfor some LDF projects) will have to make the
final decisions on project selection, and this should be acknowledged openly; there
is a risk otherwise of creating tensions and stand-offs if local proposals cannot be
refused but conflict with existing development plans.
The following recommendations are made for simplifying implementation at
local level while continuing to ensure the project fosters local participation:
* Reduce the number of meetings required by local people to implement LIF: allow
each bag to decide how many meetings it needs to hold to get the work done.
* Simplify the organizational structure of LIF at local level - it is adequate to ensure
that the bag population attends public meetings related to LIF and LDF at which
they can volunteer their involvement in the planned project; there is no need to
establish a complex series of new project-related "community groups" at local level.
Especially in rural bags, the beneficiaries should not be overburdened by
administrative responsibilities; these should be carried out by administrators,
Beneficiaries' role in LIF and LDF is to identify proposed projects at public bag
meetings; their bag leaders then draw up proposals which they submit to the sum
PAC. Once the selected projects are agreed on, a public meeting is held in the bag
again to work out local involvement in the project.
To ensure that the views of women and other interest groups or particularly
vulnerable groups are incorporated into project proposals, it is recommended
to:
* Entitle women's, youth or other interest groups (located at sum level) to submit
proposals for project financing to the sum PAC (this is in addition to proposals
coming from bag level meetings for LDF and LIF).
* Assign the community social worker responsibilityfor outreach to poor households
to assist in ensuring their views are represented at LIF bag meetings.
* Strengthen the ability of local non-government organizations present at aimag
level to lobbyfor the interests of the groups they represent (i.e. to lobby higher
levels of government with their suggestionsfor improving the overall structure of
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                                   WORLD BANK
78



social services to meet local needs), thus promoting broader public participation in
patterns of public spending for social services.
There is a good opportunity to promote, for example, women's participation
in decision-making about public spending and social sector priorities through
the work of the women's federations, who already conduct health information
campaigns which take them to rural bags and engage them in meetings and
discussion with local women. The SLP could financially support these health
information campaigns and encourage the inclusion of discussions of current
social service provision, and assistance in helping local women to formulate
proposals for improvements to such services. This would strengthen the
ability of the women's federation to act as a lobbying body for women's
interests. Similar support could be extended to youth federations and other
interest groups.
It is recommended that grant funding be sought for this last activity, as it
allows the federations to be independent of local government and in a better
position to lobby on behalf of the groups they are intended to represent.
3.5          RURAL MICROFINANCE
3.5.1        Social Impacts and Project Risks
The attitudes of local government towards micro-finance (that micro-finance
equals credit, and that credit must be kept away from the very poor, who
cannot afford to repay, the better-off, who will be taking money from the poor,
and commercial banks, who will not act in the interests of the poor ) constitute
a limited view of what micro-finance services can achieve. Unfortunately they
are a reflection of the absence of technical support for micro-finance under
NPAP.
Proposals to expand the range of micro-finance products under the SLP are
appropriate. Although PAC secretaries are right in observing that loan taking
is inappropriate, if not harmful, to the very poorest households, there are
undoubtedly poorer households who could make effective use of savings and
other micro-finance products even if they do not currently feel financially
secure enough to take a loan.
Although our study of credit availability was not extensive, interviews with
households suggest not only that there is little micro-finance to serve the poor,
but that credit for the better-off households is also severely lacking. Several
households in settled areas expressed a desired to establish small enterprises -
that could create much needed employment - but claimed it is difficult for
them to obtain loans through the banking sector. Several of them were traders,
who currently keep funds flowing by borrowing and lending between friends
and relatives also involved in petty trade. These individuals said they had no
interest in loans from NPAP or the revolving loan funds, as loan sizes were
too small for their purposes. Better financial services overall in rural areas, and
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                                WORLD BANK
79



not just those targeted directly at the poor, could have broad benefits and
would have an impact on improving the livelihoods of the poor.
3.5.2        Recommendations
Confirm on the advice of microfinance professionals whether it is possible to develop a
microfinance system which i) will lend small amounts to the poor at reasonable rates
of interest; while ii) making available more flexible loan sizes that will allow better-off
households to use the services.
LSPO would like to see that loans to better-off households would be extended
on the condition that they create employment for a poorer member of the
community. It is also felt within LSPO that the micro-finance component
needs to be managed by professional micro-finance organizations, with PACs
acting in the role of monitors, to ensure poorer households are being
effectively reached by banking services. This decision is sound, even though it
may be slow to develop and will require some changes in the attitude and
approach of local PAC staff.
3.6          PROJECTMANAGEMENT
3.6.1        Findings
PAC secretaries at aimag level expressed concerns that their workloads for the
NPAP project had been very heavy, that budgets for their operational costs
were not sufficient to allow them to carry out their work properly and
responsibilities were not clear cut for some activities.
Plans to include MoFA in implementation of PRM component are welcomed
by PAC secretaries and they anticipate this will ease their workloads and
bring in the needed professional expertise for this component.
In addition, a high turnover of staff within government bodies following
elections affects the staff of local governments, khurals, and Poverty
Alleviation Councils and means that these representatives have had little first
hand experience of incorporating the 'lessons learned ' from the previous
NPAP project into the SLP.
3.6.2        Recommendations
Concerns stated above appear to be addressed in the PIP, but taken the
importance of these issues to staff that play key roles in the success of the
project it is recommended to:
* Monitor management issues during project implementation for early identification
of any problems arising related to division of project responsibilities, operational
budgets or workloads of key project staff.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                                 WORLD BANK
80



* Create project procedures that are straightfonvard and closely in line with existing
procedures in Mongolia, to ensure administrative procedures are quickly absorbed
by staff taking up new posts.
3.7          INFORMATION AND TRAINING NEEDS OF LOCAL COMMUNirY GROUPS
Recommendations here are restricted to those information and training needs
judged necessary to promote strong community groups and community
participation. Training required for selected stakeholders includes:
Herders' associations
* seminars providing information on the relative advantages of working in
association, being formally registered, as either co-operatives or NGOs.
* training/ seminars in business and financial management and seminars in
marketing that would directly link them to market information and sources
of supply/ buyers of livestock products.
Such training might work best if it was extended both to the general public as
well as those herders already grouped in 'association'. It could form part of a
public relations exercise within the public radio broadcasts.
Community Social worker! Community Mobiliser training
* Professional social work training, with attention to gender issues and
outreach to poor households.
* The Department of Social Work, State Pedagogical University, is well
placed to develop a curriculum and conduct the training.
Bag leaders
* Training in group meeting and leadership skills, group organization,
proposal formation and writing, community participation, including
gender issues and outreach to poor households.
3.8           ETHNIC MINORrITES
3.8.1         Summary of Findings on ethnicity in the project area
The World Bank Operative Directive to safeguard the interests of 'indigenous
peoples'72 (OD 4.20) is intended to protect groups whose "social and economic
status restricts their capacity to assert their interests and rights in land and
other productive resources". It concerns groups with a social and cultural
identity distinct from the dominant society "that makes them vulnerable to
being disadvantaged in the development process."
(72) This term is understood to include distinct tribes or ethnic minorities within the project area.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                                  WORLD BANK
81



While ethnic groups within the pilot aimags have cultural identities distinct
from the Khalkh majority, as demonstrated in the analysis in the main report,
it cannot be argued that this creates conditions in which they are
disadvantaged in the development process. Nor do they meet other criteria
that would trigger the need for an Indigenous People's Development Plan for
the SLP. While the extent and severity of poverty is of great concern across the
country, there is no suggestion it is driven by ethnic differences. Ethnic
minorities as social groups are not found to engage in economic activities that
are less lucrative that those of the ethnic majority. In law, there are no
differences in the entitlement of the different ethnic groups to natural
resources, and there do not appear to be any differences in practice in access to
natural resources.
Ethnic minorities in Mongolian do not speak languages that are different from
the national language barring differences in dialect. The Kazakh are the sole
exception and while the national language is used within government offices
in Bayan Olgii as it is elsewhere, Kazakh is the medium of instruction up to
secondary level in most schools in the aimag. Without strong Mongolian
language skills, it is difficult for Kazakh students to enter, or excel, in higher
education. However, this problem is recognized by GoM and efforts are being
made within the education system to address it. Recommendations have
already been made in this chapter for ensuring access of Kazakh beneficiaries
who do not speak Mongolian to project information.
For the reasons stated above it can be said that ethnic minorities in the pilot
aimags do not meet the description of vulnerable ethnic groups as laid out in
OD 4.20. The Bank's concerns within OD 4.20 are already addressed within
the project design, with the exception of questions raised about the position of
the Kazakh with reference to the use of their native language. However, the
issue is broadly recognized by government, and has been practically
addressed within the main recommendations of the social assessment. Should
LSPO wish to address the language barriers that Kazakh face in a broader
context, it is suggested that funding be sought for a small project adjacent to
the SLP which provides support for the development of Kazakh textbooks and
the establishment of local printing presses (rather than presses located in
Ulaan Baatar as is currently the case) to reduce the costs of Kazakh texts.
However, as the project expands beyond phase one, issues of ethnicity should
be assessed again. In particular, if Khuvsguul province is included in
subsequent phases of the project, some ethnic groups in that province (Tsaatan
reindeer herders) are likely to fall under the description of vulnerable ethnic
groups are defined by OD 4.20. In addition, the NSO is scheduled to publish a
monograph on census results concerning ethnicity in July 2002 and this should
be reviewed in preparation for SLP Phase II.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                            WORLD BANK
82



3.8.2         Recommendations
The preparation of a separate Indigenous People's Development Plan is unwarranted
for Phase One of the SLP.
Another assessment should be made of ethnic groups in the area of project expansion
in the period leading up to Phase Two of the SLP.
3.9          INVOLUNTARY RESETLEMENT
3.9.1         Findings
There are two areas in which the World Bank Operational Policy 4.12 on
Involuntary Resettlement is potentially applicable to the Mongolia Sustainable
Livelihoods project.
Construction of small-scale infrastructure under the LIF and PRM
components. Activities under the Local Initiative Fund will be selected and
implemented with the direct involvement of local communities. This minimizes the
extent to which projects involving resettlement or acquisition of assets that adversely
affects these same local communities are going to be undertaken - they are screened by
these groups themselves. The only pastoral risk management activities that involve the
acquisition of land are the construction of wells and shelters. Existing wells to be
rehabilitated under PRM are on common use pasture; new wells on land over which a
single individual has possession or use rights would be ineligibleforfunding as this
would be viewed as an individual good, wells built by herders' associations or other
groups with financingfrom PRM would be initiated by these groups themselves and
built on land over which they have use rights. Thus in none of these cases does there
appear to be a threat of anyone in the project area losing personal productive assets as
a result of project activities. Any loss of common assets (such as common grazing
land) is expected to be very minor, and would consist of activities planned and selected
by the people affected.
It should be noted that OP 4.12 itself states that this policy, "does not apply to
restrictions of access to natural resources under community based project
provided that an assessment satisfactory to the Bank established that the
communitv decision-making process is adequate, and includes measures to
mitigate impacts on the vulnerable members of the community". This may be
interpreted as meaning that the operational policy would not apply for the LIF
component if local level decision-making processes are indeed adequate.
Establishment of new inter aimag reserves. FAO preparation consultants have
analyzed the possibility that the establishment of new reserves would result in people
using that land being pushed out. Inquiriesfor the social assessmentfound that the
key reserve in question, shared between Gobi Altai and Bayankhongor, has been
disused as a reserve for many years, and people have now begun to use it as grazing
land. The MoFA representative interviewed informed us that those who already have
shelters in the area are veryfew and will be allowed to continue to use the landfor
regular grazing but that others will not be admitted unless there is an emergency. As
long as there remains sufficient pasture to allow the area tofunction as an emergency
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                                  WORLD BANK
83



reserve this seems a perfectly sensible solution which safeguards the rights of those
who already have shelters inside the reserve.
3.9.2         Recommendations
In the opinion of the social assessment consultant:
World Bank Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) is not
invoked in the case of the Mongolia Sustainable Livelihoods Project.
If the acquisition of productive assets remains a concernfor the Bank it is
suggested that a proviso be added to both the PRM and LIF components: that no
project which involves the acquisition of personal assets should be carried out
under the two components.
3.10          MONITORING AND EVALUATION
A system of monitoring and evaluation is to be developed at the beginning of
the project with the assistance of monitoring and evaluation expert(s)73.
Recommendations for ensuring an effective participatory monitoring and
evaluation system are as follows:
* Distinguish between what higher administrative levels need to monitor and what
local people need/want to monitor about project activities.
i Establish aframeworkfor local level monitoring systems that is meaningful to local
people. This may mean allowing each bag to determine indicators to be used locally.
Some bags may choose to monitor a whole series of indicators of community
development; others may only wish to know how the money was spent.
*  Create a monitoringframeworkfor higher administrative levels that is manageable.
Higher levels need to measure the extent to which local people participated in
project activities and their views of project outcomes. However, this does not need
to be gathered in every bag in the core aimags. Many projects that attempt this end
up overloaded with information that is never used. Rather, data may be gathered
from a representative sample of core aimags. This makes for a more in depth
evaluation which can include qualitative questions as part of the evaluation and
allows the views of poorer households to be more meaningfully included.
Suggested indicators for measuring social impacts and local participation in
the project are as follows. These are refined from the stakeholder indicators
mentioned in Chapter II, Section K.

3.11           FURTHER STEPS IN SOCIAL ASSESSMENT
This social assessment consists primarily of a screening exercise which
attempts broad coverage of a wide range of topics. As the project proceeds
into implementation it is recommended to make social assessments more
directly relevant to project implementation in the following ways:
* Integratefurther assessment exercises into the system of monitoring and
evaluation; and;
* Designfocused topical studies to answer questions of immediate relevance to the
project as they arise.
The social assessment was unable to cover some issues in great depth, and if
these continue to be of importance they could be taken up as short studies mid
way through the implementation of phase one. They include:
* A study of livelihoods of farming households;
* in depth assessments of formal and informal credit use and barter among
households in the core aimags;
* A focused study of progress in controlling wolf and rodent populations,
including attitudes towards biodiversity protection and sustainable
resources use.
Two issues merit study towards the end of the first phase of the project. These
are:
* Further assessment of ethnic issues (especially in Khovsgol aimag) once the
project expands to phase II.

Annex III:
Social Assessment Terms of Reference
Terms of Reference
MONGOLIA: SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS PROJECT
Social Assessment
Background
Since July 2000, the Government of Mongolia (GoM) has made poverty
reduction the centerpiece of its Action Program. Building on the significant
achievements and lessons learned during the implementation of the National Poverty
Alleviation Program (NPAP) over 1994-2000, GoM is in the process of formulating a
second-phase national program to help bring about a sustained reduction in the
incidence of poverty in Mongolia, within the overall framework of its draft Interim
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. At the same time, important lessons have also
been learned from the successive dzud1 of 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 that have
significant implications for policy and operational approaches aimed at reducing
poverty and vulnerability in Mongolia. With this in mind, GoM recently approved a
National Program to Establish a System for the Protection of Livestock from Drought
and Dzud2.
GoM has requested support from the World Bank for aspects of this second-
phase program, and accordingly has begun to prepare the proposed Sustainable
Livelihoods Project (SLP) for financing by IDA with possible grant contributions from
UN agencies and/or bilateral partners. The proposed project aims to support a shift in
emphasis under the national anti-poverty strategy towards operational approaches
that promote secure and sustainable rural livelihoods, and includes four components:
a) Pastoral Risk Management: an integrated strategy developed and
adopted for managing covariant risk in pastoral livestock production (including dzud,
drought, disease, and price-related risks). The strategy would need to take into
account required actions at all stages of a risk 'cycle' from risk avoidance and
reduction, through risk response, to recovery from risk; and would need to
differentiate between those risk episodes that can be predicted to some extent
(drought, certain diseases or price risks) and those that usually cannot owing to their
sudden onset (dzud). In combination with other project components, this component
would aim to assist in addressing the underlying causes of rising vulnerability to
drought and dzud;
1 Dzud is the generic Mongolian term for a range of late autumn, winter, and early spring
weather conditions that prevent livestock from obtaining sufficient feed from open grazing.
They include deep snow (tsagaan dzud) or ice (tumur dzud) covering pastures, but also the
absence of snow (khar dzud) where this would normally be the primary source of water for
animals on otherwise unusable winter pastures. Dzud conditions tend to be exacerbated by
drought during the preceding summer which reduces the amount of green forage in summer
and standing litter available for grazing during winter/spring.
2 Approved under Government Resolution No.47, March 13, 2001.



b) Rural Micro-Finance Services: the outreach of financially and
institutionally sustainable micro-finance services (savings and credit) to poor and
vulnerable households and individuals in rural areas improved, with the possible
inclusion of micro-insurance instruments to help manage idiosyncratic risks and as a
form of guarantee for credit;
c) Community Investment Funds: efficient, socially inclusive, and
transparent community-driven mechanisms identified and established to facilitate
community prioritization, selection, co-financing, and execution of investments in
basic infrastructure and social services provision, combining local resource
mobilization with matching government grants; and
d) Project Management: a decentralized project management framework
realized through the progressive devolution of project management responsibilities to
aimag (provincial) and sum (district) levels within local governments, while retaining
overall coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and fiduciary oversight at central
(national) level.
Overall Environmental and Social Assessment Process
Environmental Assessment (EA) and Social Assessment (SA) for the proposed
Sustainable Livelihoods Project - consistent with good practice in World Bank-
financed projects more generally - is understood not as a one-off 'input' but as a
process that forms an integral part of project identification and preparation and
eventual implementation. Several important steps in this EAISA process have
already been completed, including:
A national-level, public consultation meeting in December 1999, conducted
as part of project identification, in which key stakeholder groups (elected
citizens' representatives/ parliamentarians; representatives of NGOs and
other civil society organizations, such as research institutes; private sector
representatives; and senior officials of the relevant line ministries) were asked
to construct 'problem trees' and 'objective trees' to facilitate discussion of
lessons learned from experience under NPAP and priorities that might be
addressed under the second-phase national anti-poverty program;
*  An analysis of land policy and land tenure arrangements in Mongolia,
conducted as part of ongoing policy dialogue with Government of Mongolia on
the theme of land reform. Particular attention was paid during this exercise to
pasture land tenure arrangements in policy and in practice, with a view to
informing the design of the pastoral risk management component of the
proposed Project. Additional work has been carried out on pasture conflict or
dispute resolution by members of the local advisory group for this project
component, with the support of the Asia Foundation.
*  The Participatory Living Standards Assessment (PLSA), conducted by
National Statistical Office of Mongolia with World Bank support between
March and September 2000, which aimed systematically to elicit the
perceptions and analyses of over 2,000 community members throughout
Mongolia on changing living standards in the 1990s, with a view to informing
future public policy and operational programs design to reduce poverty in
Mongolia (e.g. the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), and the design
of the second-phase anti-poverty program to follow NPAP); and
*  An 'Intensive-Learning' Implementation Completion Report (ILI),
documenting lessons learned under the World Bank-supported Poverty
Alleviation for Vulnerable Groups Project (PAVGP), which formed the major



source of financing for NPAP. This ILI was structured around a series of
stakeholder workshops at different levels, carried out in 17 provinces
(aimags), 9 urban districts (duuregs), 51 rural districts (sums), and 20 urban
sub-districts (khoroos), with a total of 2,340 participants; with two national-
level synthesis workshops. The ILI was designed to generate lessons learned
that would feed directly into the preparation of the proposed Sustainable
Livelihoods Project. It was conducted jointly by a 'core learning team',
involving staff of the relevant implementing agencies, local governments,
representatives of the Borrower (Ministry of Finance and Economy), and
World Bank mission members, to ensure maximum ownership of the findings
and recommendations.
Following these activities (beginning in June 2001), consultant inputs have
been mobilized to assist Government of Mongolia to prepare feasibility studies for the
principal project components (pastoral risk management (PRM), community
investment funds (CIF), and rural micro-finance services (RMF)). These preparatory
studies are guided by the advisory group - a team of local specialists drawn from
civil society (including NGOs and research institutes), private sector, and government
agencies - that serves as a group of local peer reviewers for at least the duration of
project preparation. These specialists are an integral part of the overall preparation
team and EA/SA process, and bring local technical knowledge and particular
experience to bear on project design.
In the light of the preparation studies that has been initiated, a dedicated EA
and SA of the specific activities proposed for financing under the SLP may now be
carried out. These TORs concern the dedicated SA, which should be seen in the
context of the overall EA/SA process that began with the activities described above.
The dedicated EA is dealt with under separate TORs.
Objectives
The overall purpose of the Social Assessment (SA) is to assist the Borrower
in designing and implementing the proposed Project with the support and active
involvement of individuals and groups that will potentially be the most directly
affected by project activities. The SA process should help properly select Project
areas and to appropriately identify the Project primary beneficiaries and their needs.
The SA is also necessary in order to ensure that the Project is designed to avoid or
minimize any adverse impacts and social costs the Project could cause to local
society. The SA should provide guidance during project preparation to re-design
project activities or propose mitigation measures to lessen any adverse impacts and
social costs the Project may have.
The SA should be viewed as an iterative process of consultation to take place
throughout the Project's life cycle, not just as a report to prepare for project
implementation. Ongoing social investigation and analysis need to be continuously
and systematically carried out along with Project implementation. As such, the
performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation that will be established as a
result of the SA may require further refinement in later stages of the Project.
The SA should be conducted in order to make contributions to the Project
design in the following aspects: (a) investigating local socio-economic situations so
as to ensure that the proposed Project interventions are suitable for local
development; (b) learning herders' and other primary beneficiaries' expectations and
attitudes so as to ensure that the Project incentives for change (e.g. expressed in
different animal husbandry and grassland management skills and practices) are



acceptable and welcome to the target population; (c) adopting a participatory
approach to Project management in order to encourage herder and other primary
beneficiaries' involvement and assure them of equal access to Project activities
irrespective of differences in wealth or well-being; gender; or ethnic, religious, or
other aspects of cultural identity; (d) diagnosing any anticipated social costs of the
Project to mitigate negative impacts wherever they might appear; and (e) establishing
baseline socio-economic indicators for project monitoring and evaluation.
The aims of the SA are:
* To ensure that the project benefits poor and vulnerable households in the project
area, including ethnic minorities, women and children (NB. gender analysis in
Mongolia often needs to take account of the specific ways men as well as women
may be disadvantaged in the development process)
* To strengthen the participation of beneficiaries, including the poorest, women and
ethnic minorities and other vulnerable groups, in all stages of the project cycle.
The Social Assessment (SA) of the SLP, as outlined in these Terms of Reference
(TORs), would be prepared to meet the requirements of both the World Bank's
project appraisal process and the Government of Mongolia's social assessment
process. The information obtained from the SA will be shared and discussed with the
rest of the preparation team and used as input into the final design of the project.
In order to ensure best practices are employed and a high quality output is
achieved, this Social Assessment will be carried out within the World Bank
recommendations for Social Assessments as described in the document GP 10.05
(Social Analysis through Social Assessment). GP 10.05 describes the "four pillars" of
Social Assessment:
1.    Identification of key social development and participation issues;
2.    Evaluation of institutional and social organizational issues;
3.    Definition of the participation framework;
4.    Establishment of mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation.
All four pillars should be covered in this SA, making reference to those
aspects of the SA process that have already been initiated or completed at the time
of this consultant input.
Issues
The SA should focus on issues that directly and indirectly impact the key
stakeholders in the Project. The overall question guiding the SA is, "How will the
proposed Project Activity affect the key or primary stakeholders?". For example, will
it require them to move, or to find new or additional employment? Will they suffer
any fall in his standard of living? Any and all potentially adverse impacts resulting
from the Project need to be investigated and mitigated where necessary with
appropriate compensation mechanisms if required by the Bank's Safeguard Policies.
The intended social development outcomes of the proposed SLP are expected to
be positive, and include:
* Poor but otherwise viable herding households continue to be able to
pursue livestock-based livelihoods in a sustainable manner



* 'off-herd' or non-livestock-related livelihood diversification in rural areas or
in smaller urban settlements (sum (district) or aimag (provincial) centers)
made possible for other households
both of these categories of household able to cope with and respond to a
wide range of idiosyncratic and covariant risks without having to dispose
of assets at low prices, borrow at high rates of interest, or withdraw
children from school (i.e. vulnerability reduced, or livelihood security
enhanced)
inclusive and accountable mechanisms established through which
communities play a key role in prioritizing, selecting, co-financing, and
executing investments in small-scale infrastructure
community members' own assessments of the quantity and quality of
local infrastructure improved as measured using community 'scorecards'
(arising from participatory M&E)
The range of issues that should be addressed by the SA include, but are not
limited to:
1. What are the livelihood systems and aspirations of middle-vulnerable, poor and
very poor herder and non-herder households (prepare illustrative pie charts)?
2. To what extent does each of the project components support the livelihood
strategies of each category of household?
3. Are assumptions about people's likely reaction to the project consistent with what
is known about target groups (in the right column of the project design summary/
logical framework) correct?
4. How extensive is the risk of elite capture of the benefits of the three project
components?
5. What actions are proposed to mitigate that risk? Are these measures adequate?
If not, outline an action plan to mitigate the risk of elite capture.
6. How can the project empower poor households and women to influence the
choice of community investment fund (CIF) schemes or to protect the pasture use
rights of households with few livestock?
7. What needs to be monitored and by whom to ensure that benefits go to the
intended target groups and that a disproportionate share of benefits is not
captured by people who are not vulnerable? Propose concrete but simple and
easily measured indicators.
8. Assess whether or not there is risk that inequality between (as well as within)
communities will be worsened as a result of project activities, and if so, propose
mitigating measures to minimize that risk. For example, will less remote or
already better-off communities, or those with stronger potential for local resource
mobilization, be likely to capture a disproportionate share of benefits under the
CIF? Formulae for cost-sharing will need to be developed that take account of
geographical isolation and potential for local resource mobilization.
9. Do any of the Bank's social safeguard policies apply - particularly those relating
to indigenous peoples (OD 4.20)? Why or why not? If they apply, prepare an
action plan to safeguard the livelihoods of indigenous peoples.
10. Describe and assess the role of NGOs (refer to the Bank's GP14.70), the private
sector, and other civil society organizations at various stages in the project cycle,
including: their role in project identification (through consultation and
collaboration); and possible forms of collaboration where appropriate during
implementation (e.g. livestock breeders' associations in pastoral risk
management, potential TA providers under rural micro-finance services
component, or potential contractors under the CIF component).



Scope of Work
As part of this dedicated Social Assessment, a number of activities need to be
conducted during Project Preparation, which is the focus of this scope of work.
1 .    Broadly, the SA should collect sufficient information on beneficiaries/ primary
stakeholders in the proposed project areas to assess:
* The situation of and capacity for participation of beneficiaries in all stages of
the project cycle; and
* The possibilities for and obstacles to project benefits going to poor and
vulnerable households.
The SA should pay particular attention to assessing:
• Institutional capacity: Study local formal and informal institutions and formal
and informal leaders, with specific attention paid to organizational structures
for group-based management of rangelands and livestock, marketing of
livestock and livestock products, and management of wells and water
sources. The SA should analyze the roles, rights and responsibilities of
formal and informal institutions in relation to local people, and their influence
on local people. The SA should also assess the capacity of formal and
informal leaders to lead participatory work and to ensure that project benefits
reach the most vulnerable.
* Ethnic minorities: Assess the traditions, institutions, social customs,
production customs, intra-household relationships, gender roles, and
practices of the different minority groups as these relate to the project (such
as, pastoral livestock production and management, communal cooperation
and management of self initiated development activities, management and
use of credit, and other aspects relevant to the project), and assess relations
between different minority groups, and between minority groups and Khalkh
Mongols.
' Project benefits: Assess the differing needs of different groups (different
minorities, different wealth class of herders, men, women, children, herding
households without livestock due to losses from dzud, non-herding
households) for different types of project activities, and the potential benefits
of the different groups from project works. Determine who will benefit most
and least from the different types of project activities, and assess the possible
conflicts that may arise between different groups (poor and wealthy herders,
for example).
* Government policy: Assess the relevant government programs, policies and
laws, in order to determine how these programs, policies and laws will
support or hinder the goals of the SA (participation of beneficiaries in the
project cycle, and ensuring that project benefits reach all, including the most
vulnerable). If deemed necessary and relevant to the project, make
recommendations for amendments to relevant laws, policies and programs.
2.    Establish indicators, produce a baseline for each indicator, and develop a
monitoring and evaluation mechanism, building on existing arrangements for
participatory and conventional M&E to assess:
* How equitable project processes and benefits are in terms of the poor and
vulnerable; and
* The degree of participation of beneficiaries in all stages of the project cycle.
Note that a community 'scorecard' approach is proposed for the CIF component. The
SA should contribute to its elaboration. Consistent with other approaches to



participatory M&E/ social auditing, performance indicators will need to be developed
at least in part with the involvement of key/ primary stakeholders.
3.    Make concrete recommendations to strengthen project design to ensure:
*  That the project benefits the poor and vulnerable;
*  The participation of beneficiaries in all stages of the project cycle; and
*  The benefits are sustainable.
4.    Identify any possible negative impacts of the project on different groups of the
poor and most vulnerable households (including different minority groups), and
propose mitigation measures to protect the most vulnerable as needed.
5.    Determine if a Indigenous People's Development Plan is required, and, if so,
develop TORs to prepare such a plan. (This issue depends chiefly on which aimags
are selected for pilot activities to be financed under each of the components. For
example, if Bayan-Olgii were selected, the presence in that aimag of a significant
Kazakh population would most likely trigger the Bank's Operational Directive OD 4.20
on Indigenous Peoples, and an IPDP may be required. Other aimags that may trigger
OD 4.20 include: Khovd (Kazakh minority in some sums, also minority Mongol
groups such as Torgut); Khovsgol (Tsaatan reindeer herders); and perhaps Dornod
(if Buryat Mongols were deemed to be disadvantaged in the development process).
This list is offered for indicative purposes only, and is not suggested to be
comprehensive).
6. Determine if Beneficiary Participation Plan is required for the Project, and, if so,
develop TORs to prepare such a plan.
Detailed Activities to be undertaken under the SA
1. Assemble a demographic and socio-economic profile of the main population
groups living in the project area. The location of each main population group
(including all minority groups) should be referenced on a map. The profile should
contain the following information for each main population group: their ethnic
composition, language(s) spoken, religious affiliations, and total population. The
profile should be done on an aimag-level basis.
2. Field visits are to be made to around three of the eight or so proposed project
aimags. Within each project aimag, social assessments should be conducted at the
sum and bag level to develop a better understanding of the social and economic
situation of the intended project beneficiaries. A number of representative bags
should be assessed in each aimag. The number of bags would depend on the
ecological and socio-economic characteristics of each aimag (i.e., those aimags with
more variability in terms of vegetation types, livestock production/farming systems
and social strata would have to have more bag level assessments conducted), but at
a minimum there should be detailed information gathered for 2-3 bags within each
aimag.
Information needs to be obtained on grassland tenure arrangements (i.e., privately
contracted or used as group) seasonal pattern of grassland use and livestock
movement patterns. There should also be a description of each herding groups
relationship vis-a-vis other groups (e.g., do they share grassland resources).



In addition, it is important to emphasize that data needs to be collected on livestock
production and the main livestock products and the value of these products to give a
measure of income.
3. Identify the key stakeholder groups represented among the herding populations.
Determine which other key stakeholder groups exist and should be consulted during
the SA process. Discuss and report on the following issues as they pertain to each
stakeholder group:
* Local land tenure and resource use and other mechanisms of resource allocation
and control; inheritance patterns; local political and administrative controls over
resources; formal and non-formal land rights and pasture use rights
* Economic livelihood and production systems; division and availability of labor,
productivity, incomes (including the involvement of women in livelihood activities
as well as a gender analysis of labor in production activities);
* Resource consumption patterns; the spatial nature of resource use patterns, with
particular attention to differences among nomads and farm households in
managing livestock and grasslands ecosystems; and attitudes towards wildlife,
especially rodents (includes mice, marmots, voles, pikas, etc.) in the grasslands,
biodiversity protection and sustainable natural resource use;
i Social and kinship organization of communities within the project area;
organization of the local government, traditional groupings of the population,
(social stratification and differentiation), decision-making and consultation
systems; and conflict resolution mechanisms, viewed in the context of livelihood
sources and strategies and risk management;
* Capacity of local institutions within the project area (including community groups
and representative organizations used by the different nationalities) to participate
in decision-making, implementation, and operations and evaluation in the project
context;
* Religious beliefs, practices, and sacred sites as they relate to livestock
production and grazing management and this project;
* Stakeholders' perceptions of the project as tentatively planned; and
* Stakeholders' own perceptions of how to judge if the project is successful.
4. Using the information ascertained above:
* Assess potential benefits for the stakeholder groups resulting from the proposed
project;
* Assess potential adverse impacts on the stakeholder groups resulting from the
proposed project;
* Recommend mitigation measures that would allay any and all adverse impacts,
incorporating participatory mechanisms and extensive use of indigenous
knowledge systems;
* Provide specific recommendations to improve project design;
* Assess the training needs of local community groups, summarizing the skills and
tools they will need to fully participate in the project;
* Propose monitorable indicators and M&E mechanisms to ensure equitable
distribution of project benefits and sustainability;
* Draft the SA report, including suggestions for any necessary changes to the
Project design and/or implementation arrangements. Bring these changes to the
attention of the World Bank and record them in the Project documentation, e.g.
PIP.



Methodology
The following methods should be employed to ascertain the information for the
SA report:
*  Review of literature and socio-economic studies of the local populations
residing within and near the proposed project area (advisory group to advise
on sources), including studies conducted in association with proposed SLP
(e.g. studies of pasture land tenure arrangements and conflict management
mechanisms, Participatory Living Standards Assessment 2000, etc)
*  Review of government statistics and other data pertaining to resource use
and livelihood to be supplemented by data collected by a household
questionnaire;
*  Face-to-face in-depth interviews (case studies) with individual members or
households of each stakeholder group, including representatives from
government, local community groups, NGOs, academic and research
institutes;
*  PRA or other participatory learning and action (PLA) methods. Focus groups
using a variety of data-gathering techniques (preference rankings, mapping
exercises, etc.).
Outputs
The results of the social assessments for each community within the project
area should be articulated in a final report (with map of project sites included).
Statistical information from the baseline survey should be analyzed and reported in
the text body. In addition, to the final report, prepare a matrix (table) with a minimum
of four columns which addresses: Specific Issues; Specific Recommendations;
Responsible Group, and Remarks. This matrix will be a useful reference for
consultations with stakeholders and for discussions related to improving project
design. Any changes to the project design and/or implementation arrangement
should be reflected in the PIP.
Expertise Required
An international consultant with an advanced degree in an appropriate social
science discipline (e.g. social anthropology, sociology, human geography, political
science, etc), with significant experience conducting Social Assessments in
connection with Bank-financed projects (or those financed by other development
banks, such as ADB, with similar social safeguards policies). Prior experience in
Mongolia is strongly preferred.
The international consultant will work in a team with one or more local
consultants with appropriate disciplinary backgrounds (e.g. human geography, social
anthropology, land use planning, development management, specialists in the
application of participatory learning and action methods, etc).
Timing and Deliverables
The consultant team shall begin work on or around July 29, 2001, for a
minimum period of 3 weeks. The assignment will begin with participation in a project
design/ logframe workshop (July 30-August 2) to learn the details of the proposed
project design from the broader project preparation team, including consultants,
counterparts, and local specialists as members of the advisory group.

Annex VI: World Bank Operational Directive 4.20: Indigenous Peoples
Operational Directive
OD 4.20 September 1991
This directive was prepared for the guidance of staff of the World Bank and is not
necessarily a complete treatment of the subjects covered.
Indigenous Peoples
Introduction
1. This directive describes Bank (note 1) policies and processing procedures for
projects that affect indigenous peoples. It sets out basic definitions, policy objectives,
guidelines for the design and implementation of project provisions or components for
indigenous peoples, and processing and documentation requirements.
2. The directive provides policy guidance to (a) ensure that indigenous people benefit
from development projects, and (b) avoid or mitigate potentially adverse effects on
indigenous people caused by Bank-assisted activities. Special action is required where
Bank investments affect indigenous peoples, tribes, ethnic minorities, or other groups
whose social and economic status restricts their capacity to assert their interests and
rights in land and other productive resources.
Definitions
3. The terms "indigenous peoples," "indigenous ethnic minorities," "tribal groups,"
and "scheduled tribes" describe social groups with a social and cultural identity
distinct from the dominant society that makes them vulnerable to being disadvantaged
in the development process. For the purposes of this directive, "indigenous peoples" is
the term that will be used to refer to these groups.
4. Within their national constitutions, statutes, and relevant legislation, many of the
Bank's borrower countries include specific definitional clauses and legal frameworks
that provide a preliminary basis for identifying indigenous peoples.
5. Because of the varied and changing contexts in which indigenous peoples are
found, no single definition can capture their diversity. Indigenous people are
commonly among the poorest segments of a population. They engage in economic
activities that range from shifting agriculture in or near forests to wage labor or even
small-scale market-oriented activities. Indigenous peoples can be identified in
particular geographical areas by the presence in varying degrees of the following
characteristics:
(a) a close attachment to ancestral territories and to the natural resources in
these areas;
(b) self-identification and identification by others as members of a distinct



cultural group;
(c) an indigenous language, often different from the national language;
(d) presence of customary social and political institutions; and
(e) primarily subsistence-oriented production.
Task managers (TMs) must exercise judgment in determining the populations to
which this directive applies and should make use of specialized anthropological and
sociological experts throughout the project cycle.
Objective and Policy
6. The Bank's broad objective towards indigenous people, as for all the people in its
member countries, is to ensure that the development process fosters full respect for
their dignity, human rights, and cultural uniqueness. More specifically, the objective
at the center of this directive is to ensure that indigenous peoples do not suffer adverse
effects during the development process, particularly from Bank-financed projects, and
that they receive culturally compatible social and economic benefits.
7. How to approach indigenous peoples affected by development projects is a
controversial issue. Debate is often phrased as a choice between two opposed
positions. One pole is to insulate indigenous populations whose cultural and economic
practices make it difficult for them to deal with powerful outside groups. The
advantages of this approach are the special protections that are provided and the
preservation of cultural distinctiveness; the costs are the benefits foregone from
development programs. The other pole argues that indigenous people must be
acculturated to dominant society values and economic activities so that they can
participate in national development. Here the benefits can include improved social
and economic opportunities, but the cost is often the gradual loss of cultural
differences.
8. The Bank's policy is that the strategy for addressing the issues pertaining to
indigenous peoples must be based on the informed participation of the indigenous
people themselves. Thus, identifying local preferences through direct consultation,
incorporation of indigenous knowledge into project approaches, and appropriate early
use of experienced specialists are core activities for any project that affects indigenous
peoples and their rights to natural and economicresources.
9. Cases will occur, especially when dealing with the most isolated groups, where
adverse impacts are unavoidable and adequate mitigation plans have not been
developed. In such situations, the Bank will not appraise projects until suitable plans
are developed by the borrower and reviewed by the Bank. In other cases, indigenous
people may wish to be and can be incorporated into the development process. In sum,
a full range of positive actions by the borrower must ensure that indigenous people
benefit from development investments.
Bank Role



10. The Bank addresses issues on indigenous peoples through (a) country economic
and sector work, (b) technical assistance, and (c) investment project components or
provisions. Issues concerning indigenous peoples can arise in a variety of sectors that
concern the Bank; those involving, for example, agriculture, road construction,
forestry, hydropower, mining, tourism, education, and the environment should be
carefully screened (2). Issues related to indigenous peoples are commonly identified
through the environmental assessment or social impact assessment processes, and
appropriate measures should be taken under environmental mitigation actions (see OD
4.01, Environmental Assessment).
11. Country Economic and Sector Work. Country departments should maintain
information on trends in government policies and institutions that deal with
indigenous peoples. Issues concerning indigenous peoples should be addressed
explicitly in sector and subsector work and brought into the Bank-country dialogue.
National development policy frameworks and institutions for indigenous peoples
often need to be strengthened in order to create a stronger basis for designing and
processing projects with components dealing with indigenous peoples.
12. Technical Assistance. Technical assistance to develop the borrower's abilities to
address issues on indigenous peoples can be provided by the Bank. Technical
assistance is normally given within the context of project preparation, but technical
assistance may also be needed to strengthen the relevant government institutions or to
support development initiatives taken by indigenous people themselves.
13. Investment Projects. For an investment project that affects indigenous peoples, the
borrower should prepare an indigenous peoples development plan that is consistent
with the Bank's policy. Any project that affects indigenous peoples is expected to
include components or provisions that incorporate such a plan. When the bulk of the
direct project beneficiaries are indigenous people, the Bank's concerns would be
addressed by the project itself and the provisions of this OD would thus apply to the
project in its entirety.
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (3)
Prerequisites
14. Prerequisites of a successful development plan for indigenous peoples are as
follows:
(a) The key step in project design is the preparation of a culturally appropriate
development plan based on full consideration of the options preferred by the
indigenous people affected by the project.
(b) Studies should make all efforts to anticipate adverse trends likely to be induced by
the project and develop the means to avoid or mitigate harm (4).
(c) The institutions responsible for government interaction with indigenous peoples
should possess the social, technical, and legal skills needed for carrying out the
proposed development activities. Implementation arrangements should be kept
simple. They should normally involve appropriate existing institutions, local



organizations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) with expertise in matters
relating to indigenous peoples.
(d) Local patterns of social organization, religious beliefs, and resource use should be
taken into account in the plan's design.
(e) Development activities should support production systems that are well adapted to
the needs and environment of indigenous peoples, and should help production systems
under stress to attain sustainable levels.
(f) The plan should avoid creating or aggravating the dependency of indigenous
people on project entities. Planning should encourage early handover of project
management to local people. As needed, the plan should include general education
and training in management skills for indigenous people from the onset of the project.
(g) Successful planning for indigenous peoples frequently requires long lead times, as
well as arrangements for extended follow-up. Remote or neglected areas where little
previous experience is available often require additional research and pilot programs
to fine-tune development proposals.
(h) Where effective programs are already functioning, Bank support can take the formn
of incremental funding to strengthen them rather than the development of entirely new
programs.
Contents
15. The development plan should be prepared in tandem with the preparation of the
main investment. In many cases, proper protection of the rights of indigenous people
will require the implementation of special project components that may lie outside the
primary project's objectives. These components can include activities related to health
and nutrition, productive infrastructure, linguistic and cultural preservation,
entitlement to natural resources, and education. The project component for indigenous
peoples development should include the following elements, as needed:
(a) Legal Framework. The plan should contain an assessment of (i) the legal status of
the groups covered by this OD, as reflected in the country's constitution, legislation,
and subsidiary legislation (regulations, administrative orders, etc.); and (ii) the ability
of such groups to obtain access to and effectively use the legal system to defend their
rights. Particular attention should be given to the rights of indigenous peoples to use
and develop the lands that they occupy, to beprotected against illegal intruders, and to
have access to natural resources (such as forests, wildlife, and water) vital to their
subsistence and reproduction.
(b) Baseline Data. Baseline data should include (i) accurate, up-to-date maps and
aerial photographs of the area of project influence and the areas inhabited by
indigenous peoples; (ii) analysis of the social structure and income sources of the
population; (iii) inventories of the resources that indigenous people use and technical
data on their production systems; and (iv) the relationship of indigenous peoples to
other local and national groups. It is particularly important that baseline studies
capture the full range of production and marketing activities in which indigenous



people are engaged. Site visits by qualified social and technical experts should verify
and update secondary sources.
(c) Land Tenure. When local legislation needs strengthening, the Bank should offer
to advise and assist the borrower in establishing legal recognition of the customary or
traditional land tenure systems of indigenous peoples. Where the traditional lands of
indigenous peoples have been brought by law into the domain of the state and where
it is inappropriate to convert traditional rights into those of legal ownership,
alternative arrangements should be implemented to grant long-term, renewable rights
of custodianship and use to indigenous peoples. These steps should be taken before
the initiation of other planning steps that may be contingent on recognized land titles.
(d) Strategy for Local Participation. Mechanisms should be devised and maintained
for participation by indigenous people in decision making throughout project
planning, implementation, and evaluation. Many of the larger groups of indigenous
people have their own representative organizations that provide effective channels for
communicating local preferences. Traditional leaders occupy pivotal positions for
mobilizing people and should be brought into the planning process, with due concern
for ensuring genuine representation of the indigenous population (5). No foolproof
methods exist, however, to guarantee full local-level participation. Sociological and
technical advice provided through the Regional environment divisions (REDs) is
often needed to develop mechanisms appropriate for the project area.
(e) Technical Identification ofDevelopment or Mitigation Activities. Technical
proposals should proceed from on-site research by qualified professionals acceptable
to the Bank. Detailed descriptions should be prepared and appraised for such
proposed services as education, training, health, credit, and legal assistance. Technical
descriptions should be included for the planned investments in productive
infrastructure. Plans that draw upon indigenous knowledge are often more successful
than those introducing entirely new principles and institutions. For example, the
potential contribution of traditional health providers should be considered in planning
delivery systems for health care.
(f) Institutional Capacity. The government institutions assigned responsibility for
indigenous peoples are often weak. Assessing the track record, capabilities, and needs
of those institutions is a fundamental requirement. Organizational issues that need to
be addressed through Bank assistance are the (i) availability of funds for investments
and field operations; (ii) adequacy of experienced professional staff; (iii) ability of
indigenous peoples' own organizations, local administration authorities, and local
NGOs to interact with specialized government institutions; (iv) ability of the
executing agency to mobilize other agencies involved in the plan's implementation;
and (v) adequacy of field presence.
(g) Implementation Schedule. Components should include an implementation
schedule with benchmarks by which progress can be measured at appropriate
intervals. Pilot programs are often needed to provide planning information for phasing
the project component for indigenous peoples with the main investment. The plan
should pursue the long-term sustainability of project activities subsequent to
completion of disbursement.



(h) Monitoring and Evaluation. (6) Independent monitoring capacities are usually
needed when the institutions responsible for indigenous populations have weak
management histories. Monitoring by representatives of indigenous peoples' own
organizations can be an efficient way for the project management to absorb the
perspectives of indigenous beneficiaries and is encouraged by the Bank. Monitoring
units should be staffed by experienced social science professionals, and reporting
formats and schedules appropriate to the project's needs should be established.
Monitoring and evaluation reports should be reviewed jointly by the senior
management of the implementing agency and by the Bank.
The evaluation reports should be made available to the public.
(i) Cost Estimates and Financing Plan. The plan should include detailed cost estimates
for planned activities and investments. The estimates should be broken down into unit
costs by project year and linked to a financing plan. Such programs as revolving
credit funds that provide indigenous people with investment pools should indicate
their accounting procedures and mechanisms for financial transfer and replenishment.
It is usually helpful to have as high a share as possible of direct financial participation
by the Bank in project components dealing with indigenous peoples.
Project Processing and Documentation
Identification
16. During project identification, the borrower should be informed of the Bank's
policy for indigenous peoples. The approximate number of potentially affected people
and their location should be determined and shown on maps of the project area. The
legal status of any affected groups should also be discussed. TMs should ascertain the
relevant government agencies, and their policies, procedures, programs, and plans for
indigenous peoples affected by the proposed project (see paras. 11 and 15(a)). TMs
should also initiate anthropological studies necessary to identify local needs and
preferences (see para. 15(b)). TMs, in consultation with the REDs, should signal
indigenous peoples issues and the overall project strategy in the Initial Executive
Project Summary (IEPS).
Preparation
17. If it is agreed in the IEPS meeting that special action is needed, the indigenous
peoples development plan or project component should be developed during project
preparation. As necessary, the Bank should assist the borrower in preparing termns of
reference and should provide specialized technical assistance (see para. 12). Early
involvement of anthropologists and local NGOs with expertise in matters related to
indigenous peoples is a useful way to identify mechanisms for effective participation
and local development opportunities. In a project that involves the land rights of
indigenous peoples, the Bank should work with the borrower to clarify the steps
needed for putting land tenure on a regular footing as early as possible, since land
disputes frequently lead to delays in executing measures that are contingent on proper
land titles (see para. 15(c)).
Appraisal



18. The plan for the development component for indigenous peoples should be
submitted to the Bank along with the project's overall feasibility report, prior to
project appraisal. Appraisal should assess the adequacy of the plan, the suitability of
policies and legal frameworks, the capabilities of the agencies charged with
implementing the plan, and the adequacy of the allocated technical, financial, and
social resources. Appraisal teams should be satisfied that indigenous people have
participated meaningfully in the development of the plan as described in para. 14(a)
(also see para. 15(d). It is particularly important to appraise proposals for regularizing
land access and use.
Implementation and Supervision
19. Supervision planning should make provisions for including the appropriate
anthropological, legal, and technical skills in Bank supervision missions during
project implementation (see paras. 15(g) and (h), and OD 13.05, Project Supervision).
Site visits by TMs and specialists are essential. Midterm and final evaluations should
assess progress and recommend corrective actions when necessary.
Documentation
20. The borrower's commitments for implementing the indigenous peoples
development plan should be reflected in the loan documents; legal provisions should
provide Bank staff with clear benchmarks that can be monitored during supervision.
The Staff Appraisal Report and the Memorandum and Recommendation of the
President should summarize the plan or project provisions.
1. "Bank" includes IDA, and "loans" include credits.
2. Displacement of indigenous people can be particularly damaging, and special
efforts should be made to avoid it. See OD 4.30, Involuntary Resettlement, for
additional policy guidance on resettlement issues involving indigenous people.
3. Regionally specific technical guidelines for preparing indigenous peoples
components, and case studies of best practices, are available from the Regional
environrment divisions (REDs).
4. For guidance on indigenous peoples and environmental assessment procedures, see
OD 4.01, Environmental Assessment, and Chapter 7 of World Bank, Environmental
Assessment Sourcebook, Technical Paper No. 139 (Washington, D.C., 1991).
5. See also "Community Involvement and the Role of Nongovernmental
Organizations in Environmental Assessment" in World Bank, Environmental
Sourcebook, Technical Paper No. 139 (Washington, D.C., 1991).

Annex VII: World Bank Operational Policy 4.12: Involuntary Resettlement
InvoluntarY Resettlement
OP 4.12
December 2001
Note: OP and BP 4.12 together replace OD 4.30, Involuntary Resettlement. This OP and BP apply
to all projects for which a Project Concept Review takes place on or after January 1, 2002.
Questions may be addressed to the Director, Social Development Department (SDV).
1. Bankl. experience indicates that involuntary resettlement under development
projects, if unrmitigated, often gives rise to severe economic, social, and
environmental risks: production systems are dismantled; people face impoverishment
when their productive assets or income sources are lost; people are relocated to
environments where their productive skills may be less applicable and the competition
for resources greater; community institutions and social networks are weakened; kin
groups are dispersed; and cultural identity, traditional authority, and the potential for
mutual help are diminished or lost. This policy includes safeguards to address and
mitigate these impoverishment risks.
Policy Objectives
2. Involuntary resettlement may cause severe long-term hardship, impoverishment,
and environmental damage unless appropriate measures are carefully planned and
carried out. For these reasons, the overall objectives of the Bank's policy on
involuntary resettlement are the following:
(a) Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimized,
exploring all viable altemative project designs.2
(b) Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be
conceived and executed as sustainable development programs, providing sufficient
investment resources to enable the persons displaced by the project to share in project
benefits. Displaced persons3 should be meaningfully consulted and should have
opportunities to participate in planning and implementing resettlement programs.
(c) Displaced persons should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods
and standards of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement
levels or to levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation,
whichever is higher.4
Impacts Covered
3. This policy covers direct economic and social impacts5 that both result from Bank-
assisted investment projects6 , and are caused by



(a) the involuntary7 taking of land8 resulting in
(i) relocation or loss of shelter;
(ii) lost of assets or access to assets; or
(iii) loss of income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not the
affected persons must move to another location; or
(b) the involuntary restriction of access9 to legally designated parks and protected
areas resulting in adverse impacts on the livelihoods of the displaced persons.
4. This policy applies to all components of the project that result in involuntary
resettlement, regardless of the source of financing. It also applies to other activities
resulting in involuntary resettlement, that in the judgment of the Bank, are (a) directly
and significantly related to the Bank-assisted project, (b) necessary to achieve its
objectives as set forth in the project documents; and (c) carried out, or planned to be
carried out, contemporaneously with the project.
5. Requests for guidance on the application and scope of this policy should be
addressed to the Resettlement Committee (see BP 4.12, para. 7). 10
Required Measures
6. To address the impacts covered under para. 3 (a) of this policy, the borrower
prepares a resettlement plan or a resettlement policy framework (see paras. 25-30)
that covers the following:
(a) The resettlement plan or resettlement policy framework includes measures to
ensure that the displaced persons are
(i) informed about their options and rights pertaining to
resettlement;
(ii) consulted on, offered choices among, and provided with
technically and economically feasible resettlement alternatives;
and
(iii) provided prompt and effective compensation at full
replacement costl 1 for losses of assetsl2 attributable directly to
the project.
(b) If the impacts include physical relocation, the resettlement plan or resettlement
policy framework includes measures to ensure that the displaced persons are
(i) provided assistance (such as moving allowances) during
relocation; and
(ii) provided with residential housing, or housing sites, or, as
required, agricultural sites for which a combination of
productive potential, locational advantages, and other factors is
at least equivalent to the advantages of the old site. 13



(c) Where necessary to achieve the objectives of the policy, the resettlement plan or
resettlement policy framework also include measures to ensure that displaced persons
are
(i) offered support after displacement, for a transition period,
based on a reasonable estimate of the time likely to be needed
to restore their livelihood and standards of living; 14 and
(ii) provided with development assistance in addition to
compensation measures described in paragraph 6(a) (iii), such
as land preparation, credit facilities, training, or job
opportunities.
7. In projects involving involuntary restriction of access to legally designated parks
and protected areas (see para. 3(b)), the nature of restrictions, as well as the type of
measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts, is determined with the participation
of the displaced persons during the design and implementation of the project. In such
cases, the borrower prepares a process framework acceptable to the Bank, describing
the participatory process by which
(a) specific components of the project will be prepared and implemented;
(b) the criteria for eligibility of displaced persons will be determined;
(c) measures to assist the displaced persons in their efforts to improve their
livelihoods, or at least to restore them, in real terms, while maintaining the
sustainability of the park or protected area, will be identified; and
(d) potential conflicts involving displaced persons will be resolved.
The process framework also includes a description of the arrangements for
implementing and monitoring the process.
8. To achieve the objectives of this policy, particular attention is paid to the needs of
vulnerable groups among those displaced, especially those below the poverty line, the
landless, the elderly, women and children, indigenous peoples, 15 ethnic minorities, or
other displaced persons who may not be protected through national land
compensation legislation.
9. Bank experience has shown that resettlement of indigenous peoples with traditional
land-based modes of production is particularly complex and may have significant
adverse impacts on their identity and cultural survival. For this reason, the Bank
satisfies itself that the borrower has explored all viable alternative project designs to
avoid physical displacement of these groups. When it is not feasible to avoid such
displacement, preference is given to land-based resettlement strategies for these
groups (see para. 11) that are compatible with their cultural preferences and are
prepared in consultation with them (see Annex A, para. 11).
10. The implementation of resettlement activities is linked to the implementation of
the investment component of the project to ensure that displacement or restriction of



access does not occur before necessary measures for resettlement are in place. For
impacts covered in para. 3(a) of this policy, these measures include provision of
compensation and of other assistance required for relocation, prior to displacement,
and preparation and provision of resettlement sites with adequate facilities, where
required. In particular, taking of land and related assets may take place only after
compensation has been paid and, where applicable, resettlement sites and moving
allowances have been provided to the displaced persons. For impacts covered in para.
3(b) of this policy, the measures to assist the displaced persons are implemented in
accordance with the plan of action as part of the project (see para. 30).
11. Preference should be given to land-based resettlement strategies for displaced
persons whose livelihoods are land-based. These strategies may include resettlement
on public land (see footnote I above), or on private land acquired or purchased for
resettlement. Whenever replacement land is offered, resettlers are provided with land
for which a combination of productive potential, locational advantages, and other
factors is at least equivalent to the advantages of the land taken. If land is not the
preferred option of the displaced persons, the provision of land would adversely affect
the sustainability of a park or protected area, 16 or sufficient land is not available at a
reasonable price, non-land-based options built around opportunities for employment
or self-employment should be provided in addition to cash compensation for land and
other assets lost. The lack of adequate land must be demonstrated and documented to
the satisfaction of the Bank.
12. Payment of cash compensation for lost assets may be appropriate where (a)
livelihoods are land-based but the land taken for the project is a small fraction 17 of
the affected asset and the residual is economically viable; (b) active markets for land,
housing, and labour exist, displaced persons use such markets, and there is sufficient
supply of land and housing; or (c) livelihoods are not land-based. Cash compensation
levels should be sufficient to replace the lost land and other assets at full replacement
cost in local markets.
13. For impacts covered under para. 3(a) of this policy, the Bank also requires the
following:
(a) Displaced persons and their communities, and any host communities receiving
them, are provided timely and relevant information, consulted on resettlement
options, and offered opportunities to participate in planning, implementing, and
monitoring resettlement. Appropriate and accessible grievance mechanisms are
established for these groups.
(b) In new resettlement sites or host communities, infrastructure and public services
are provided as necessary to improve, restore, or maintain accessibility and levels of
service for the displaced persons and host communities. Alternative or similar
resources are provided to compensate for the loss of access to community resources
(such as fishing areas, grazing areas, fuel, or fodder).
(c) Patterns of community organization appropriate to the new circumstances are
based on choices made by the displaced persons. To the extent possible, the existing
social and cultural institutions of resettlers and any host communities are preserved



and resettlers' preferences with respect to relocating in preexisting communities and
groups are honored.
Eligibility for Benefitsl8
14. Upon identification of the need for involuntary resettlement in a project, the
borrower carries out a census to identify the persons who will be affected by the
project (see the Annex A, para. 6(a)), to determine who will be eligible for assistance,
and to discourage inflow of people ineligible for assistance. The borrower also
develops a procedure, satisfactory to the Bank, for establishing the criteria by which
displaced persons will be deemed eligible for compensation and other resettlement
assistance. The procedure includes provisions for meaningful consultations with
affected persons and communities, local authorities, and, as appropriate,
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and it specifies grievance mechanisms.
15. Criteria for Eligibility. Displaced persons may be classified in one of the
following three groups:
(a) those who have formal legal rights to land (including customary and traditional
rights recognized under the laws of the country);
(b) those who do not have formal legal rights to land at the time the census begins but
have a claim to such land or assets-provided that such claims are recognized under
the laws of the country or become recognized through a process identified in the
resettlement plan (see Annex A, para. 7(f)); andl9
(c) those who have no recognizable legal right or claim to the land they are
occupying.
16. Persons covered under para. 15(a) and (b) are provided compensation for the land
they lose, and other assistance in accordance with para. 6. Persons covered under
para. 15(c) are provided resettlement assistanc2O in lieu of compensation for the land
they occupy, and other assistance, as necessary, to achieve the objectives set out in
this policy, if they occupy the project area prior to a cut-off date established by the
borrower and acceptable to the Bank.2 1 Persons who encroach on the area after the
cut-off date are not entitled to compensation or any other form of resettlement
assistance. All persons included in para. 15(a), (b), or (c) are provided compensation
for loss of assets other than land.
Resettlement Planning, Implementation, and Monitoring
17. To achieve the objectives of this policy, different planning instruments are used,
depending on the type of project:
(a) a resettlement plan or abbreviated resettlement plan is required for all operations
that entail involuntary resettlement unless otherwise specified (see para. 25 and
Annex A);



(b) a resettlement policy framework is required for operations referred to in paras. 26-
30 that may entail involuntary resettlement, unless otherwise specified (see Annex A);
and
(c) a process framework is prepared for projects involving restriction of access in
accordance with para. 3(b) (see para. 31).
18. The borrower is responsible for preparing, implementing, and monitoring a
resettlement plan, a resettlement policy framework, or a process framework (the
"resettlement instruments"), as appropriate, that conform to this policy. The
resettlement instrument presents a strategy for achieving the objectives of the policy
and covers all aspects of the proposed resettlement. Borrower commitment to, and
capacity for, undertaking successful resettlement is a key determinant of Bank
involvement in a project.
19. Resettlement planning includes early screening, scoping of key issues, the choice
of resettlement instrument, and the information required to prepare the resettlement
component or subcomponent. The scope and level of detail of the resettlement
instruments vary with the magnitude and complexity of resettlement. In preparing the
resettlement component, the borrower draws on appropriate social, technical, and
legal expertise and on relevant community-based organizations and NGOs.22 The
borrower informs potentially displaced persons at an early stage about the
resettlement aspects of the project and takes their views into account in project design.
20. The full costs of resettlement activities necessary to achieve the objectives of the
project are included in the total costs of the project. The costs of resettlement, like the
costs of other project activities, are treated as a charge against the economic benefits
of the project; and any net benefits to resettlers (as compared to the "without-project"
circumstances) are added to the benefits stream of the project. Resettlement
components or free-standing resettlement projects need not be economically viable on
their own, but they should be cost-effective.
21. The borrower ensures that the Project Implementation Plan is fully consistent with
the resettlement instrument.
22. As a condition of appraisal of projects involving resettlement, the borrower
provides the Bank with the relevant draft resettlement instrument which conforms to
this policy, and makes it available at a place accessible to displaced persons and local
NGOs, in a form, manner, and language that are understandable to them. Once the
Bank accepts this instrument as providing an adequate basis for project appraisal, the
Bank makes it available to the public through its InfoShop. After the Bank has
approved the final resettlement instrument, the Bank and the borrower disclose it
again in the same manner.23
23. The borrower's obligations to carry out the resettlement instrument and to keep the
Bank informed of implementation progress are provided for in the legal agreements
for the project.
24. The borrower is responsible for adequate monitoring and evaluation of the
activities set forth in the resettlement instrument. The Bank regularly supervises



resettlement implementation to determine compliance with the resettlement
instrument. Upon completion of the project, the borrower undertakes an assessment to
determine whether the objectives of the resettlement instrument have been achieved.
The assessment takes into account the baseline conditions and the results of
resettlement monitoring. If the assessment reveals that these objectives may not be
realized, the borrower should propose follow-up measures that may serve as the basis
for continued Bank supervision, as the Bank deems appropriate (see also BP 4.12,
para. 16).
Resettlement Instruments
Resettlement Plan
25. A draft resettlement plan that conforms to this policy is a condition of appraisal
(see Annex A, paras. 2-2 1) for projects referred to in para. 17(a) above.24 However,
where impacts on the entire displaced population are minor,25 or fewer than 200
people are displaced, an abbreviated resettlement plan may be agreed with the
borrower (see Annex A, para. 22). The information disclosure procedures set forth in
para. 22 apply.
Resettlement Policy Framework
26. For sector investment operations that may involve involuntary resettlement, the
Bank requires that the project implementing agency screen subprojects to be financed
by the Bank to ensure their consistency with this OP. For these operations, the
borrower submits, prior to appraisal, a resettlement policy framework that conforms
to this policy (see Annex A, paras. 23-25). The framework also estimates, to the
extent feasible, the total population to be displaced and the overall resettlement costs.
27. For financial internediary operations that may involve involuntary resettlement,
the Bank requires that the financial intermediary (FI) screen subprojects to be
financed by the Bank to ensure their consistency with this OP. For these operations,
the Bank requires that before appraisal the borrower or the Fl submit to the Bank a
resettlement policy framework conforming to this policy (see Annex A, paras. 23-25).
In addition, the framework includes an assessment of the institutional capacity and
procedures of each of the FIs that will be responsible for subproject financing. When,
in the assessment of the Bank, no resettlement is envisaged in the subprojects to be
financed by the Fl, a resettlement policy framework is not required. Instead, the legal
agreements specify the obligation of the FIs to obtain from the potential subborrowers
a resettlement plan consistent with this policy if a subproject gives rise to
resettlement. For all subprojects involving resettlement, the resettlement plan is
provided to the Bank for approval before the subproject is accepted for Bank
financing.
28. For other Bank-assisted project with multiple subprojects26 that may involve
involuntary resettlement, the Bank requires that a draft resettlement plan conforming
to this policy be submitted to the Bank before appraisal of the project unless, because
of the nature and design of the project or of a specific subproject or subprojects (a) the



zone of impact of subprojects cannot be determined, or (b) the zone of impact is
known but precise sitting aligmnents cannot be determined. In such cases, the
borrower submits a resettlement policy framework consistent with this policy prior to
appraisal (see Annex A, paras. 23-25). For other subprojects that do not fall within the
above criteria, a resettlement plan conforming to this policy is required prior to
appraisal.
29. For each subproject included in a project described in para. 26, 27, or 28 that may
involve resettlement, the Bank requires that a satisfactory resettlement plan or an
abbreviated resettlement plan that is consistent with the provisions of the policy
framework be submitted to the Bank for approval before the subproject is accepted for
Bank financing.
30. For projects described in paras. 26-28 above, the Bank may agree, in writing, that
subproject resettlement plans may be approved by the project implementing agency or
a responsible government agency or financial intermediary without prior Bank
review, if that agency has demonstrated adequate institutional capacity to review
resettlement plans and ensure their consistency with this policy. Any such delegation,
and appropriate remedies for the entity's approval of resettlement plans found not to
be in compliance with Bank policy, are provided for in the legal agreements for the
project. In all such cases, implementation of the resettlement plans is subject to ex
post review by the Bank.
Process Framework
31. For projects involving restriction of access in accordance with para. 3(b) above,
the borrower provides the Bank with a draft process framework that conforms to the
relevant provisions of this policy as a condition of appraisal. In addition, during
project implementation and before to enforcing of the restriction, the borrower
prepares a plan of action, acceptable to the Bank, describing the specific measures to
be undertaken to assist the displaced persons and the arrangements for their
implementation. The plan of action could take the form of a natural resources
management plan prepared for the project.
Assistance to the Borrower
32. In furtherance of the objectives of this policy, the Bank may at a borrower's
request support the borrower and other concemed entities by providing
(a) assistance to assess and strengthen resettlement policies, strategies, legal
frameworks, and specific plans at a country, regional, or sectoral level;
(b) financing of technical assistance to strengthen the capacities of agencies
responsible for resettlement, or of affected people to participate more effectively in
resettlement operations;
(c) financing of technical assistance for developing resettlement policies, strategies,
and specific plans, and for implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of resettlement
activities; and



(d) financing of the investment costs of resettlement.
33. The Bank may finance either a component of the main investment causing
displacement and requiring resettlement, or a free-standing resettlement project with
appropriate cross-conditionalities, processed and implemented in parallel with the
investment that causes the displacement. The Bank may finance resettlement even
though it is not financing the main investment that makes resettlement necessary.
34. The Bank does not disburse against cash compensation and other resettlement
assistance paid in cash, or against the cost of land (including compensation for land
acquisition). However, it may finance the cost of land improvement associated with
resettlement activities.
1. "Bank" includes IDA; "loans" includes credits, guarantees, Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
advances and grants; and "projects" includes projects under (a) adaptable program lending; (b) learning
and innovation loans; (c) PPFs and Institutional Development Funds (IDFs), if they include investment
activities; (d) grants under the Global Environment Facility and Montreal Protocol, for which the Bank
is the implementing/executing agency; and (e) grants or loans provided by other donors that are
administered by the Bank. The term "project" does not include programs under adjustment operations.
"Borrower" also includes, wherever the context requires, the guarantor or the project implementing
agency.
2. In devising approaches to resettlement in Bank-assisted projects, other Bank policies should be taken
into account, as relevant. These policies include OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment, OP
4.04 Natural Habitats, OP 4.11 Safeguarding Cultural Property in Bank-Assisted Projects,
and OD 4.20 Indigenous Peoples.
3. The term "displaced persons" refers to persons who are affected in any of the ways described in
para. 3 of this OP.
4. Displaced persons under para. 3(b) should be assisted in their efforts to improve or restore their
livelihoods in a manner that maintains the sustainability of the parks and protected areas.
S. Where there are adverse indirect social or economic impacts, it is good practice for the borrower to
undertake a social assessment and implement measures to minimize and mitigate adverse economic and
social impacts, particularly upon poor and vulnerable groups. Other environmental, social, and
economic impacts that do not result from land taking may be ident-ified and addressed through
environmental assessments and other project reports and instruments.
6. This policy does not apply to restrictions of access to natural resources under community-based
projects, i.e. where the community using the resources decides to restrict access to these resources,
provided that an assessment satisfactory to the Bank establishes that the community decision-making
process is adequate, and that it provides for identification of appropriate measures to mitigate adverse
impacts, if any, on the vulnerable members of the community. This policy also does not cover refugees
from natural disasters, war, or civil strife (see OP/BP 8.50, Emergency Recovery Assistance).
7. For purposes of this policy, "involuntary" means actions that may be taken without the displaced
person's informed consent or power of choice.
8. "Land" includes anything growing on or permanently affixed to land, such as buildings and crops.
This policy does not apply to regulations of natural resources on a national or regional level to promote
their sustainability, such as watershed management, groundwater management, fisheries management,
etc. The policy also does not apply to disputes between private parties in land titling projects, although
it is good practice for the borrower to undertake a social assessment and implement measures to
minimize and mitigate adverse social impacts, especially those affecting poor and vulnerable groups.
9. For the purposes of this policy, involuntary restriction of access covers restrictions on the use of
resources imposed on people living outside the park or protected area, or on those who continue living
inside the park or protected area during and after project implementation. In cases where new parks and
protected areas are created as part of the project, persons who lose shelter, land, or other assets are



covered under para. 3(a). Persons who lose shelter in existing parks and protected areas are also
coveredunderpara. 3(a).
10. The Resettlement Sourcebook (forthcoming) provides good practice guidance to staff on the policy.
11. "Replacement cost" is the method of valuation of assets that helps determine the amount sufficient
to replace lost assets and cover transaction costs. In applying this method of valuation, depreciation of
structures and assets should not be taken into account (for a detailed definition of replacement
cost, see Annex A, footnote 1). For losses that cannot easily be valued or compensated for in
monetary terms (e.g., access to public services, customers, and suppliers; or to fishing, grazing, or
forest areas), attempts are made to establish access to equivalent and culturally acceptable resources
and earning opportunities. Where domestic law does not meet the standard of compensation at full
replacement cost, compensation under domestic law is supplemented by additional measures necessary
to meet the replacement cost standard. Such additional assistance is distinct from resettlement
assistance to be provided under other clauses of para. 6.
12. If the residual of the asset being taken is not economically viable, compensation and other
resettlement assistance are provided as if the entire asset had been taken.
13. The alternative assets are provided with adequate tenure arrangements. The cost of alternative
residential housing, housing sites, business premises, and agricultural sites to be provided can be set off
against all or part of the compensation payable for the corresponding asset lost.
14. Such support could take the form of short-term jobs, subsistence support, salary maintenance or
similar arrangements
15. See OD 4.20, Indigenous Peoples.
16. See OP 4.04, Natural Habitats.
17. As a general principle, this applies if the land taken constitutes less than 20% of the total
productive area.
18. Paras. 13-15 do not apply to impacts covered under para. 3(b) of this policy. The eligibility criteria
for displaced persons under 3 (b) are covered under the process framework (see paras. 7 and 30).
19. Such claims could be derived from adverse possession, from continued possession of public lands
without government action for eviction (that is, with the implicit leave of the government), or from
customary and traditional law and usage, and so on.
20. Resettlement assistance may consist of land, other assets, cash, employment, and so on, as
appropriate.
21. Normally, this cut-off date is the date the census begins. The cut-off date could also be the date the
project area was delineated, prior to the census, provided that there has been an effective public
dissemination of information on the area delineated, and systematic and continuous dissemination
subsequent to the delineation to prevent further population influx.
22. For projects that are highly risky or contentious, or that involve significant and complex
resettlement activities, the borrower should normally engage an advisory panel of independent,
internationally recognized resettlement specialists to advise on all aspects of the project relevant to the
resettlement activities. The size, role, and frequency of meeting depend on the complexity of the
resettlement. If independent technical advisory panels are established under OP 4.01,
Environmental Assessment, the resettlement panel may form part of the environmental panel of
experts.
See BP 17.50, Disclosure of Operational Information (forthcoming) for detailed disclosure
procedures.
24. An exception to this requirement may be made in highly unusual circumstances (such as emergency
recovery operations) with the approval of Bank Management (see BP 4.12, para. 8). In such cases, the
Management's approval stipulates a timetable and budget for developing the resettlement plan.
25. Impacts are considered "minor" if the affected people are not physically displaced and less than
10% of their productive assets are lost.
26. For purpose of this paragraph, the term "subprojects" includes components and
subcomponents.
