YUGOSLAVIA
IMT TRACTOR FACTORY EXPANSION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the expansion of Industrija Masina i Traktora's
(IMT) plant in New Belgrade. IMT is the largest producer of wheeled tractors,
tractor accessories and farm implements in Yugoslavia, and operates a tractor
factory in New Belgrade, a motorcultivator plant in Knjazevac and a service
and repair center in Dobanovci. This expansion is designed to increase the
production capacity of IMT's New Belgrade plant from about 15,000 to 35,000
tractors per annum by 1976, including two new tractor types (20-25 hp and
over 100 hp units), and almost triple the output of tractor accessories and
agricultural implements to about 67,000 units per year. In the first stage
of the project, to which the Bank loan would apply, the necessary production
facilities will be installed, whereas the second stage, tentatively scheduled
for 1978-79, comprises the further expansion of administrative and storage
buildings. Civil and structural work was started in August 1973 and the
scheduled completion date for the project (Stage I) is the second half of
1975.
ii.       Total financing required for the project is estimated at US$87.6
million equivalent, comprising US$55.1 million for fixed assets, US$24.6
million for working capital and US$7.9 million for interest during construc-
tion. The foreign exchange component would be equivalent to US$24.6 million.
iii.      The proposed Bank loan of US$18.5 million would finance the full
cost of approximately 75% of the equipment and would cover the cif cost of
imported items and the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment and
spares. The loan would be for 14 years, including 3 years of grace. The
effective interest rate to IMT would be 9% per annum, including a guarantee
fee of 1-3/4% to the Republic of Serbia where the project is located.  The
remainder of the financing required for the project will be covered by loans
from the Belgrade Bank (US$46.1 million), local suppliers' credits (US$1.1
million), bilateral credits from clearing countries (US$1.0 million) and
internal cash generation (US$20.9 million).
iv.       Equipment and spare parts to be financed by the proposed loan
would be divided into 76 packages and would be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. For the purpose of
bid comparison, Yugoslav bids would be given the standard preference of 15
percent or actual customs duty whichever is less.
V.        The project has high priority for the Yugoslav Government, since
the Agreement for the Development of Agriculture ("Green Plan") envisages
a 3%-5% per annum productivity increase in agriculture during the seventies
and this target requires rapid growth of farm mechanization in the social
and private sectors. To meet the growing domestic demand for agricultural
machinery, the Yugoslav Government encourages the expansion of competitive
domestic industries such as IMT. Although exports are not expected to account
for more than 9% of IMT's total revenue and average US$9 million a year over
the 1973-1983 period, average net foreign exchange savings to the economy



- ii -
resulting from the project are expected to be US$22 million per year, offset-
t:ing in about one year the entire foreign exchange cost of the project. Faced
with mounting debt service obligations on short and medium term suppliers'
credits, and an increasing gap in the balance of trade, Yugoslavia needs to
save foreign exchange through the expansion of competitive industries.
vi.       TMT has achieved a dominant market position among Yugoslav tractor
manufacturers because of its comprehensive product range and widespread
dealer organization. IMT's selling prices are on average about 20-30% below
the border prices of comparable imported tractors from convertible currency
countries. The standard tractor types are well designed, reliable and tech-
nically competitive on the world market. The Company's nationwide sales and
services network is well established and assures the supply of spare parts
and matching farm implements.  The project is designed to expand IMT's capa-
city in line with domestic demand thus enabling the Company to maintain its
market share. In view of the good quality of the IMT tractors, the Company's
general services and the federal price control of tractors in Yugoslavia,
IMT's expansion of domestic capacity can be considered an acceptable means
of meeting Yugoslav tractor demand at the least cost to the Yugoslav economy.
vii.      The project is primarily oriented towards meeting domestic demand
for tractors in agriculture, about 34,000 units per year during the coming
decade. Exports and domestic tractor sales for nonagricultural use will
respectively account for 4,000 and 3,500 units per year. The market pro-
jections assume that the Yugoslav economy will aim at a level of farm
mechanization of 1 hp/ha by 1980 in order to reach the agricultural growth
target established by the Green Plan. Although financing of tractor sales
is not a problem at present, the availability of credit for the projected
level of sales, primarily for private farmers, will be crucial for maintain-
ing growth in farm mechanization and assuring IMT's domestic market.
viii.     IMT's management is young and dynamic and has implemented three
major expansions of its factories since 1966. The Company is headed by an
experienced General Manager who was elected for a 4-year term in 1971 and
who is supported by capable team of executives. In practice, the management
takes all major decisions and has the full support of the Workers' Council.
ix.       The Company's projected long-term financial position is strong,
and could allow the financing of the Stage II expansion (US$12.9 million)
in 1978/79 by internal cash generation. Of total debt and equity employed,
debt reaches a peak of 56% in 1975 but decreases to 30% by 1979, while debt
service coverage remains adequate throughout the forecast period.
x.        The project has high financial and economic rates of return of
21% and 16% respectively.  These rates are very sensitive to changes in
operating costs and revenues; however, under foreseeable adverse conditions,
the economic rate of return is unlikely to drop below 8%, or the financial
rate of return belowT 10%. The project is expected to provide additional
permanent employment for about 1,440 people and have a major employment
generating effect on the supplier industries, since IMT predominantly
machines and assembles local components and parts and the direct import
content of IMT's products will be less than 10%.



- iii -
xi.       Appraisal of the project was completed before the onset of the
energy crisis. The likely impact on the project was reviewed with IMT manage-
ment in early January, 1974 and is thought 'to be slight. The capital cost of
the project is not expected to increase by so much as would necessitate a
change in the provision for price escalation and, in any event, any additional
need for funds, whether caused by an increase in project cost and/or shortfall
in internally generated funds during project implementation, would be covered
by the Belgrade Bank.  Furthermore, energy represents only 3% of I'T's direct
operating costs and it can be assumed that any fuel-related increase in the
Company's manufacturing costs, whether resulting from higher component prices
or higher direct costs, could be passed on in the form of higher selling prices.
Finally, since Yugoslavia enjoys a favorable position in respect of energy
supply vis-a-vis other industrialized countries in Europe, it is unlikely that
the manufacturing costs of those foreign tractors against which IMT's products
would compete will be affected to a lesser extent than INT's own costs.
xii.      Based on agreements reached during negotiations on necessary
assurances, as summarized at the end of this report, the project is suitable
for a Bank loan equivalent to US$18.5 million.






I. INTRODUCTION
A.   General
1.01      This report appraises the proposed expansion project of Industrija
Masina i Traktora (IMT), the largest. producer of wheeled tractors, tractor
accessories and agricultural implements 1/ in Yugoslavia. This expansion is
designed to increase the production capacity of IMT's New Belgrade plant from
about 15,000 to 35,000 tractors per annum by 1976, including two new tractor
types (20-25 hp and over 100 hp units), and almost to triple the output of
tractor accessories and agricultural implements to about 67,000 units per
year. Total financing required for the project, including interest during
construction and incremental working capital, is Din 1,356.9 million (US$87.6
million equivalent) of which Din 381.2 million (USq24.6 million) would be in
foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan of US$18.5 million would cover 75%
of the foreign exchange cost.
1.02      Following an industrial identification mission to Yugoslavia in
1971, eight industrial projects were submitted in May 1971 to the Bank for
financing. IMT was one of the five projects selected. The project has high
priority for Yugoslavia, especially in the context of the Government's "Green
Plan", which emphasizes farm mechanization and productivity increases in
agriculture. In addition, the IMT expansion will stimulate the country's
engineering industry through purchases of engines, castings, forgings, tires
and electrical equipment. Some of the enterprises in these sub-sectors have
already started their expansions in anticipation of IMT's increased demand
for raw materials and component parts. One notable example is the expansion
3rogram of Fabrika Odlivaka Beograd (FOB), located adjacent to IMT, which
will increase its annual foundry capacity from 33,000 to 90,000 tons per year.
1.03      This loan to IMT would be the third direct loan to industry in
Yugoslavia. The first loan to the iron foundry Livnica Zelleza i Tempera-
Kikinda (Report No. 218a-YU, dated October 19, 1973) was approved by the
Bank's Executive Directors on November 20, 1973. The second loan concerning
the FOB iron foundry (Report No. 256a-YTJ, dated January 28, 1974) will be
presented together with this IMT proposal.
1.04      The appraisal of the IMT project included a market mission in June/
July, 1973 consisting of Messrs. Glenday and Wilcox (consultant) followed by
the main appraisal mission which visited Yugoslavia in August 1973, and which
consisted of Mr. Jaffe (Chief) and Miss Haug of the Industrial Projects De-
partment and Mr. Swamy Rao (consultant - UNIDO/IBRD Cooperative Program).  A
description of technical terms is given in Annex 1.

B.   The Role of the Bank
1.05      The Bank's involvement in industry in Yugoslavia has been described
in the Kikinda Iron Foundry and FOB Iron Foundry Appraisal Reports.
II. THE COMPANY
A.   Background
2.01      IMT, the 50th largest enterprise in Yugoslavia, operates three
separate plants - a factory in New Belgrade consisting of tractor and imple-
ments assembly facilities and a machine shop, a motor cultivator factory (FMK)
in Knjazevac which was acquired in 1970 and a service and repair center in
Dobanovci which merged with IMT in 1956 (Map IBRD 10716). 1/ The Company's
existing facilities are described in Annex 2-1. IMT Belgrade which will be
expanded under the project was founded in 1947, to produce pipes, tubes and
bolts. In 1955, the Company started to manufacture tractors after acquiring
a Massey-Ferguson (UK) license. Since then, IMT has undertaken a number of
expansion programs increasing its annual tractor production to 4,000 units
in 1961, 12,000 units in 1968 and 15,000 units in 1972. As the Company's
engineering and design capability increased, the manufacture of 35 hp
tractors under Massey-Ferguson license was discontinued, and IMT introduced
in 1968 its own tractor line (35, 55, 72 and 80 hp units) with corresponding
tractor attachments and agricultural implements.
2.02      The Company had operated since 1953 a foundry and pattern shop
located adlacent to IMT's production facilities in Belgrade. In 1971, this
foundry and pattern shop were established as a separate company (FOB), but
the close technical and supply relationships between IMT and FOB have been
maintained. Both companies are members of Udruzena Metalska IndustriJa (UMI),
an association of seven metal working companies in the Belgrade area. UMI
was founded in 1969 and is the 15th largest industrial group in Yugoslavia.
B.   Relationship with UMI
2.03      Details on the composition and organization of UMI are given in the
FOB Iron Foundry Appraisal Report.
2.04      Although UMI enterprises have a common development and marketing
strategy which sets out broad objectives, each member company is a separate
legal entity and is autonomous in the implementation of its production
program and the marketing of its goods. All members have to contribute
1/   FMK Knjazevac and the Service and Repair Center Dobanovci accounted
for 5.1% and 3.6% respectively of IMT's sales volume in 1972.



annually a percentage 1/ of their net income to a Joint Reserve Fund and a
Joint Development Fund established by UMI. The former is available for
interest-free loans to cover possible losses of member companies, whereas
the Joint Development F ind finances research and development programs
benefiting the entire group, and advances interest-free loans for invest-
ments by member enterprises. Moreover, UMI's approval is necessary for
annual investments exceeding Din I million by any member company (Annex 2-2).
During negotiations confirmation was obtained that UMI has approved the IMT
project and will, until the completion of the project, limit its requests
for contr:Lbutions from IMT.
C.   Organization and Management
2.05      IMT consists of four subsidiary entities, i.e. IMT Belgrade, FMK-
Knjazevac, the Service and Repair Center Dobanovci and the Workers Restaurant,
Belgrade. 2/ Each entity has a manager and labor unit council which manage
independently within the framework of the production program and policy guide-
lines laid down by the General Manager and the Workers' Council. After proj-
ect completion, a new and fifth entity will be created by dividing IMT Belgrade
into two entities - IMT Tractor Production and INT Implements Production.
2.06      IMT - as is normal in Yugoslavia - is managed by its workers.  The
self-management system is explained in Annex 2-2. Annex 2-3 gives an organi-
zation chart. The supreme managing body of the Company is the Workers'
Council consisting of 45 members elected by the workers for a period of two
years. This body formulates the enterprise's general policy, and approves
major investment plans, annual budgets and distribution of income as well as
production programs within the overall plans developed by UMI for the group
as a whole. It also elects the General Manaver and his deputy.
2.07      IMT's General Manager, Mr. Radovic, who is simultaneously plant
manager of IMT Belgrade, has had 22 years experience with the Company in
various managerial and technical positions including manager of tractors and
implements production. Mr. Radovic was elected as General Manager in June
1971 for a 4-year term and can be re-elected for another term. As General
Manager he is in charge of day-to-day operations of the enterprise and is
responsible only to the Workers' Council. In practice, the management makes
all major decisions and has the full cooperation of the Workers' Council.
The General Manager is assisted by a collegium of the Company's top executives,
by two advisers and an ad-hoc expert council which is formed from time to
time if major policy issues arise.
1/   This percentage is determined by UMI's Workers' Council.  It has been
varying between 1.0% and 1.5% p.a. during the past years.
2/   The cafeteria of the IMT factory in Belgrade has been set up as a
separate legal entity to facilitate day-to-day operations of this unit.



-4-
2.08      Most of the sales and export-import responsibilities have been
delegated to the Deputy Manager, Mr. Anastasijevic, while the General
Manager concentrates on the operations and future development of the Company.
IMT has a young, well trained and dynamic management team which is supported
by an adequate number of qualified staff.
D.   Plant Facilities at New Belgrade
2.09      The existing facilities of IMT Belgrade consist of a complex for
the production of tractor components, tractor assembly lines, an implements
assembly bay, a scaffolding shop and miscellaneous facilities for storage,
maintenance and supporting services. They are described in detail in
Annex 2-1. The plant is presently used at capacity. The major problems
facing the New Belgrade factory are lack of space for storage, inadequate
materials flow and internal transport, some obsolete machinery and poor
working conditions. The latter concern the antiquated heating, lighting
and ventilation systems, insufficient social facilities (restrooms, cafeteria),
and conditions in the paint shop which do not meet minimum health standards.
The proposed expansion project is designed to overcome these bottlenecks
and shortcomings.
2.10      Due to the overcrowded working conditions, proper safety measures
have not been observed and thus the incidence of work-related accidents has
been high. As greater attention needs to be paid in this area, the Bank
obtained assurances from the Company during negotiations that it will institute
and maintain appropriate industrial safety practices.
E.   Past Growth and Financial Results
2.11      Details of tMT's past production and product lines by plant are
given in Annex 2-4 and historical income statements for the past five years
(1968-1972) in Annex 2-5. The following table shows the trend of sales and
net income of tNT since 1969:

2.12      The Company's sales history is characterized by a steady increase
of sales of all IMT tractor models (35, 55, 72 and 80 hp) and the introduction
of new implements (plows, seed drills, cultivators and disc harrows) in 1971/72.
This is the result of substantial investments in 1967/68 and 1971/72. The 35
hp tractor is IMT's most important product, accounting for about 51% of the
Company's net sales revenues in 1972. Over 90% of IMT's sales originates
from its Belgrade plant.
2.13      IMT's net income more than doubled in 1971 reaching Din 57.8 million,
following a 50% increase in revenues. Yet, while sales in 1972 increased by
another 40%, net income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 7.1% from
7.7% in 1971. This is. due to the high cost of operating on three shifts and
the charging of start-up expenses and interest during construction of the
1971/1972 expansion (Annex 2-4) to the income statement.
2.14      IMT's exports over the past five years have been constant in absolute
terms, but declining in relative terms and amounted to Din 53.8 million or
5.2% of net sales in 1972. This trend, however, does not reflect IMT's
competitiveness; on the contrary, its tractors are highly competitive both
technically and cost-wise as will be discussed in more detail in Chapter VI
and Annex 3. However, because of the continuing shortage of tractors and
agricultural implements in Yugoslavia, the Company has chosen to export only
such quantities as were required to earn its needed foreign exchange through
the retention quota system. 1/ Although IMT plans to step up its exports
(Annex 6-1), export strategy will be largely determined by the future
1/   Yugoslav enterprises can use 20% of the foreign exchange from their
annual export earnings, i.e., their retention quota, without restriction.

domestic demand for the Company's products. The record of production, sales
and earnings indicates that IMT is a technically competent and profitable
company.

/1   "Equity" includes Business Funds, Collective Consumption Funds, Reserve
Funds and compulsory loans; these terms are explained in Annex 2-7.
Nearly 30. of the equity increases in 1971 and 1972 are due to re-
valuations of fixed assets which seem justified in view of the 20-25%
p.a. inflation rates Yugoslavia experienced during the late sixties.
For projection purposes it has been assumed that measures now being
taken to curb inflation will be successful and that no revaluation
of fixed assets will become necessary in the foreseeable future.
2.16      The Company has a sound financial structure.  The debt/equity ratio
of 16:84 at the end of 1972 is satisfactory.  The current ratio has since
1971 been at a satisfactory level, because the Company has been taking
conscious steps to reduce its receivables and accounts payables while main-
taining a minimum level of cash.

III.   THE MARKET
3.01      A detailed analysis of the market for tractors and farm implements
is attached as Annex 3.
A.   Supply and Demand for Tractors
1.   Recent Trends
3.02      The Yugoslav tractor fleet has increased three-fold from 42,730
units in 1962 to about 120,500 units in 1972, thereby reaching a level of
farm mechanization of 0.45 hp/ha of arable land. However, farm mechanization
varies greatly between regions and types of farms: (i) in Croatia and Slo-
venia a level of farm mechanization of more than 0.6 hp/ha has been reached
compared with less than 0.2 hp/ha in Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia,
and (ii) social sector farms average 0.86 hp/ha with tractors in the 50 hp
range, whereas private farms have reached 0.36 hp/ha with an average 32 hp
tractor.
3.03      As shown in the following table, during the 1968-72 period domestic
sales increased by 53% and domestic production by 41%. Imports are determined
annually by the Yugoslav trade commission in the light of the domestic supply
and demand gap.

excludes CKD/PKD tractor sets and components.
2.   IMT's Competitive Position
3.04      IMT is the largest Yugoslav manufacturer of tractors accounting for
85% of the domestic capacity. The Company produces tractors of its own de-
sign which was developed on the basis of a Massey-Ferguson license.



-8-
It relies on Yugoslav suppliers for more than 90% of its raw materials and
components. In contrast, the five other tractor producers 1/ merely assemble
imported components. In view of the existing supply and demand gap and the
growing trend towards farm mechanization in Yugoslavia, several companies
besides DIT plan to expand their manufacturing plants, thereby increasing
domestic tractor production capacity more than two and a half times to about
47,500 units by 1977.
3.05      IMT's dominant market position is the result of a competitive
product line:
(i) IMT tractors are well designed, reliable and easy to maintain.
The Company has updated its product line progressively, so that
the standard 30-65 hp models are technically competitive on the
world market. In regard to the IMT 75 and 85 hp tractors, com-
parable European models have superior convenience features and
a better hydraulic system. IMT plans to improve the charac-
teristics of its large hp models, in order to present in this
range as well an internationally competitive product.
(ii) Matching implements are readily available for IMT tractors, in
contrast to imported models, where lack of spare parts and
implements has led to diseconomies and underutilization.
(iii) The nationwide sales and services network is well estab-
lished and has been strengthened concurrently with IMT's
production expansion. The Company's reliable maintenance
and repair facilities constitute a definite competitive
advantage over its competitors.

3.06      A price comparison of IMT tractors with imported units is detailed
in Annex 3, para 22 and summarized below:
Tractor Price Comparison - August 1973

Steyr (52 hp), Austria   80,556         Deutz (85 hp), Germany       129,300
John Deere (52 hp), U.S. 80,230
/1   Ex duties and taxes:  cif border prices for imported tractors and IMT
ex-factory price.
The above table shows that IMT's ex-factory selling prices are still 20-30%
below the border prices of comparable imported tractors from convertible
currency countries; 1/ i.e., the Company does not need the protection of the
present 29% tariff on imported tractors.
3.07      Clearly, IMT  has achieved a dominant position in the Yugoslav mar-
ket, by offering good, reliable and price competitive tractors and implements.
The project is designed to expand ITIT's capacity in line with domestic demand,
thus maintaining its domestic market share. In view of the fact that (i)
tractor prices in Yugoslavia are determined annually by a Federal Commission,
i.e., IMT will not be able to exploit its market position by increasing prices
arbitrarily; (ii) the quality of the IMT tractors is good; and (iii) the
Company's service and repair network is reliable, it is unlikely that the
Yugoslav economy would benefit from increased competition and thus further
proliferation among domestic and foreign tractor manufacturers at this time.
3.   Market Forecast
3.08      The "Green Plan" projects an annual growth of aggregate agricul-
tural production of 3.2% until 1975 and 5% in the 1976-1983 period. To reach
this target Yugoslavia will have to increase significantly the level of farm
mechanization of private and social farms. How farm mechanization in Yugo-
slavia compares with that in other countries is shown below:
1/   Border prices of Eastern European tractors have been 5-20% below IMT's
selling prices; however, they have been arrived at in barter agreements.

Source:   FAO, 1972
The above table indicates that developed countries with large farms and esten-
sive farming have reached a mechanization level of at least 1.0 hp/ha, and
the mechanization levels of countries with more intensive farming such as France,
Italy and the UK range between 1.6 - 3.2 hp/ha. Therefore, in the market
projections it has been assumed that Yugoslavia will have achieved full mecha-
nization in agriculture at a level of about 1.0 hp/ha on the large farms in
the social sector and approximately 2 hp/ha on the small private farms
(Annex 3, para 27).
3.09      In addition to the level of farm mechanization outlined above, the
projections for the Yugoslav tractor demand in agriculture assume that:
(i)  following a worldwide trend average hp size of tractors
will increase from 51 hp to 60 hp on social farms and 32 hp
to 38 hp on private farms by 1983;
(ii)  the replacement market will be 8% of the tractor fleet
(12.5 years) until 1980 and 6% (16 years) thereafter, since
with improved mechanical skills and repair services in
Yugoslavia the useful life of tractors will be expanded
and the large number of imported tractors will be phased
out (Annex 3, para 30); and
(iii)  about 10% of the power requirements of private farms and
the mechanization of vineyards and orchards will be met by
motorcultivators (5-12 hp).



- 1 1 -
On the basis of these assumptions the projected tractor parc and replacement
needs for the private and social sectors are presented in Annex 3, Table 5.
The forecast indicates a domestic market for tractors in agriculture of 34,000
units per year over the next 10 years of which about 2,000 units would be in
the social sector.
3.10      A domestic demand of 3,500 tractors per year for non-agricultural
use has been projected. This level is in line with experience in Western
European countries and takes into account the widespread use of tractors for
haulage, construction and forestry work in Yugoslavia.
3.11      The following table summarizes the projected supply and demand
situation in Yugoslavia in a typical year between 1977 and 1983:

/1   For capacity expansions see Annex 3, page 6.
/2   Not including 7,500 units of riding motorcultivators which also
compete with the 18-30 hp tractors.
3.12      The export figure of 4,000 units/year is a realistic target and
reflects the minimum number of tractors the Yugoslav manufacturers will have
to export to earn their retention quota. IMT can be expected to account for
most of these exports without having to resort to marginal pricing since
(i) DIT products are not only competitive technically and price wise on the
world market, but (ii) the Company has experience in exporting assembled
tractors or tractor sets to developing countries, and (iii) the association
with Mlassey-Ferguson facilitates the supply of spare parts and components to
that firm. Sufficient export credits on suitable terms are available and
are therefore not considered a constraint on exports. In the Yugoslav context



- 12 -
of import regulation, imports of tractors are meant to supplement domestic
supply. It can be expected that Yugoslavia will continue importing at least
2,000 tractors per year in order to satisfy barter arrangements and needs for
special tractors which are not produced locally.
3.13      The above supply/demand comparison indicates possible oversupply
for two market segments:
(i)  in the 18-30 hp category, total tractor demand of 4,100 units
per year compares with an annual domestic capacity of 4,600
small tractors of 20-25 hp and 7,500 units of the Pasquali
riding motorcultivators (18.5 hp). While part of the supply
can be expected to be absorbed by the specific market for
motorcultivators, the new IMT tractor will face considerable
competition in this product category.
(ii)  in the above 60 hp category, there is likely to be an over-
supoly, if IMT produces 3,700 units per year and Torpedo 150
tractors per year. Only in the short term may the social farms
absorb the excess supply when switching to higher horsepower
units.
3.14      LMT is aware of domestic competition, particularly for the small
tractor market, and possible market constraints in the above 60 hp categories.
As explained in para 4.06, IMT's production facilities will allow flexibility
to shift emphasis among different models and spare parts production. There-
fore, the Company will monitor closely the production cost and market success
of its various products in order to adjust the production volume and model
choice accordingly.
4.   Availability of Credit
3.15      Availabilitv of credit has not been a constraint to tractor
sales in the past, since social farms have had ready access to credit
institutions and the private farmers who purchased tractors disposed of
sufficient income from workers remittances, sales of work animals, and on
and off farm work to pay cash. However, to reach the projected level of
farm mechanization, credit will have to be channeled to private farmers, who
may require up to Din 400 million per year in credit (Annex 3, paras 33-35)
after 1976. To this end IMT plans to make available about Din 75 million
per year for the 1976-78 period from its annual cash surplus and intends to
channel to its dealers an additional Din 100-120 million per year through
on-lending of credits from the Belgrade Bank. As to Government funds, the
"Green Plan" as known to date indicates that, while some funds will be
made available in the form of agricultural credit for farm mechanization,
no specific amount is earmarked for private farmers.
3.16      Since private farmers account for nearly 80% of the projected
tractor demand and the farm income of the average private holding may not
allow cash purchases of tractors, the domestic demand for tractors can be
expected to become very sensitive to the availability of credit to private



- 13 -
farmers, as soon as the present excess demand is satisfied. Therefore, during
negotiations, it was agreed that DCN would submit to the Bank by mid-1975 a
5-year program for financing sales of IMT tractors and agricultural implements,
which would support IMT's production program in the long-run, and provide
information on ways and means of channeling the required funds to private
farmers as well as the social sector. The Government also stated during
negotiations that adequate credit to private farmers would be available as
part of the objectives of the Green Plan.
B.   Supply and Demand for Agricultural Implements
3.17      An acceptable level of tractor utilization can only be reached if
implements are available in numbers, types and sizes required to match the
sale of tractors. Contrary to tractor production and the manufacture of
rather sophisticated implements such as disc harrows and seed drills which
require design expertise and high toolage costs, manufacture of standard
implements (trailers, plows) can easily be taken up. As a result, there are
besides the tractor companies about 20 small producers of farm implements in
Yugoslavia.
3.18      IMT's implement line is of good design and quality (Annex 2-4) and
offers a wide range of product types according to tractor size and fa-rm imple-
ments. The Company has subcontracted the manufacture of the majority of
tillers, mowers and plows and is steadily expanding its implements line.
However, agricultural implements for imported large tractors have been in
short supply resulting in an under-utilization of tractors on social farms.
3.19      The market projection for major farm implements are summarized
below:

Until the early eighties the demand for the 3 major implement types (trailers,
plows and disc harrows) will amount to 50-75% of the number of tractors sold
to new customers, whereas more specialized equipment such as planters, seed
drills and cultivators will account for not more than 20%. In contrast to
tractors, implements have a useI'ul life of about 15 years and obsolescence
is of lesser importance. The above projections take into account that, based
on a percentage of tractor sales, the market for implements relative to tractors
will be higher in the social sector than in the private sector, since the
social sector will switch to larger tractors (60 hp and above) which require
new large size semi-mounted or pull type implements.
3.20      IMT's proposed production program and subcontracting arrangements
for implements are adequate and should maintain the utilization of IMT trac-
tors at an appropriate level.
C.   IMT's Marketing Organization
3.21      IMT's marketing operations are directed by the Sales and Service
Department in Belgrade, which has established a nation-wide sales and services
network in Yugoslavia (Map IBRD 10716) and a training center in Belgrade.
The present sales organization consists of 26 dealers and 100 sub-agents,
which are not yet exclusive distributors of IMT tractors, implements and parts.
Export sales are handled by the export division in Belgrade which uses estab-
lished dealer networks of other manufacturers for the distribution and servi-
cing of IMT tractors in foreign countries. The maintenance and repair service
relies primarily on 146 existing service workshops, which have direct contracts
with rIT. The Service and Repair Center in Dobanovci specializes in tractor
overhaul, while serving also as maintenance and repair workshop in its dis-
trict.
3.22      Due to the past and present demand-supply gap for tractors in
Yugoslavia, IMT's dealer network undertakes promotional functions only to
a minor extent. The Company is aware of the need for more intensive market-
ing activities after project completion. To this end, IMT plans to (i) ini-
tiate a training and information program for dealers and customers, and
(ii) establish exclusive dealerships. In parallel, the maintenance and
repair system will be strengthened by (i) establishing regional training
centers for servicing personnel, and (ii) subcontracting new workshops.
3.23      The continued strengthening of the sales and service organization
is essential in order to maintain IMT's dominant market position and good
quality repair service. Accordingly, during negotiations, the Company agreed
to submit to the Bank by mid-1975 a 5-year program for the expansion of
its local and export marketing and servicing organization.

IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Technical Description
4.01      A detailed technical description of IMT's expansion program is
given in Annex 4-1. Preparation of the project and detailed engineering was
undertaken by the Company with the assistance of experienced local engineering
firms. 1/ The proposed project relates only to the Belgrade plant, and is
designed to increase the Company's annual production capacity to 35,000
tractors, 27,000 units of agricultural implements, and a proportionate number
of accessories and spare parts. 2/ The new production program will include
the design and manufacture of two new tractor models - one of 20-25 hp and
one above 100 hp.
4.02      The expansion will be carried out in two phases.  Phase I, or "the
project," includes all production facilities necessary to reach the proposed
output target by 1976/77. Phase II will provide a tools and maintenance shop,
additional storage, offices and general service buildings. The Company plans
to implement the second phase (estimated cost Din 200 million or US$12.9 mill-
ion equivalent), no earlier than 1978-1979, i.e. about two years after comple-
tion of the project when internal cash generation and foreign exchange
surpluses are expected to allow such an investment.
4.03      More specifically, the project (Phase I) of the expansion program
consists of the construction of (i) a new tractor parts machine plant; (ii)
a new tractor assembly plant; (iii) rehabilitation and reorganization of the
existing plant in order to improve work conditions and health standards and
to accommodate the implement assembly lines and the maintenance and tool shop,
including the dismantling of the present implements production bay; (iv) con-
struction of an office building with space for the Production Department, a
cafeteria, locker-rooms, etc.; and (v) construction of storage facilities for
raw materials, parts and supplies. The plant layouts (Annex 4-2) illustrate
the physical facilities to be constructed under the project. The plant
design, materials flow and the equipment selected for the project are
considered satisfactory.
4.04      A maJor objective of the project will be to improve the materials
flow by creating sufficient storage areas and rationalizing the internal
transport systems. To this end, the Company intends primarily to use conve-
yors and forklift trucks.

2/   Assuming one shift working in the assemily plants and two shifts in
the tractor parts production shop.



- 16 -
4.05      The Company intends to produce about 400 tractors above 90 hp by
1976 and 3,000 tractors of 20-25 hp by 1977. The new 100 hp models will
include a maximum number of components and design characteristics of the exis-
ting models, but for economical reasons incorporate imported gearlinks (Annex
2-4, para. 11). Prototype production was scheduled to start in January 1974,
by which time IMT also intended taking a final decision on the type, possible
licensing arrangements and development strategy for its new 20-25 hp tractor.
The Company's Research and Development Department is well equipped and has
sufficient and experienced staff to justify the projected time schedule for
bringing the new models into production. During negotiations, an assurance
was obtained that the Company will keep the Bank informed of the status of
product development for its new tractors.
4.06      Because of the interchangeability of parts, the production of
tractors inherently has a high degree of flexibility in respect of product
mix. For example, by appropriate production scheduling the Company can
adjust the output of different tractor types or components. As regards
volume, IMT could, by working three shifts, increase its tractor output to
an annual rate of approximately 50,000 units per year. In contrast, by
changing the product mix, and manufacturing more implements, accessories
and spare parts than presently planned, the Company could economically
reduce tractor production to 25-30,000 units per year.
4.07      Satisfactory plans for infrastructure - power, gas, roads, compressed
air, water and heating - have been developed in cooperation with FOB. A
major investment is required for a new transformer station and transmission
lines, since IMT's electricity consumption will nearly triple after project
completion. During negotiations, the Company provided documentary evidence
that it has obtained commitments from the respective authorities for the
timely development of infrastructure facilities.
B.   tanpower and Training
4.08      In April 1973, IMT employed 3,524 people, 2,905 of whom worked at
the Belgrade factory. Additional employees needed after the expansion are
estimated at 1,445 including 532 in the services departments. Details are
given in Annex 4-3. As mentioned earlier, IMT is today operating on a three
shift basis. After expansion, i.e. in 1976, the tractor assembly plant is
expected to operate one shift, the implement assembly and tractor parts ma-
chine shop two shifts and heat treatment facilities three shifts. Plant lay-
out and equipment selection indicate that the project relies primarily on
semi-automatic and standard machines rather than on fully-automatic transfer
lines and assembly operations. This labor-intensive approach results in
considerable direct employment generation and is economically justified
(Annex 6-3) in view of Yugoslavia's relatively low wage rates.
4.09      The Company has elaborated a program of manpower needs and a re-
cruitment schedule (Annex 4-3) which foresees direct recruitment of workers
and staff as well as training of the present labor force in IMT's school, at
Belgrade University or in Yugoslav technical institutions. IMT does not
anticipate any difficulties in recruiting the necessary personnel for various



- 17 -
skill levels. The Company is well known in Yugoslavia for its technical
excellence and employee benefits and has always been able to attract good
applicants.
C. Ecology
4.10      A new Federal law for environmental and pollution control stipu-
lates that all enterprises must conform to certain minimum pollution stand-
ards by the end of 1973 and meet all set standards by 1977. In general,
IMT's production is a clean operation with no adverse effects on the environ-
ment, and thus special measures to achieve compliance with Yugoslav laws or
other reasonable pollution standards are not required. One exception is the
effluent water from the surface protection, paint and hardening facilities.
To overcome potential problems, the Company neutralizes all water used on the
plant site before discharging it into the treatment facilities of the Belgrade
Water Supply Company.
D. Pro_ject Execution
4.11      IMT will have the major responsibility for project execution.
During the past five years, the Company has implemented three sizeable ex-
pansion projects (Annex 2-4) and is well experienced to carry out the project.
The main burden will rest with IMT's Expansion Department, a unit which was
created in April 1973 to assure adequate preparation and supervision of the
project. Mr. Predragovic, 63, an experienced engineer, is in charge of the
Expansion Department and is assisted by a qualified staff of about 25, in-
cluding engineers familiar with network analysis and other planning tools
and economists experienced in cost control.
4.12      Since the Company has no previous experience of international
competitive bidding procedures, especially in the preparation of bid documents
in English, IMT has contracted a local firm "RAPID" which has dealt with
procurement of foreign equipment to assist it in this task. Documents
submitted to the Bank to date indicate that this arrangement is satisfactory
and one that will permit orderly and timely preparation of equipment specifi-
cations and bid evaluations.
4.13      The civil construction contract was awarded to the Yugoslav con-
tractor RATKO MITROVIC in March 1973 after competitive bidding limited to
local construction companies. Construction work started in August 1973 and
is proceeding on schedule. Local and foreign equipment suppliers will provide
assistance in erection and start-up and the usual performance guarantees. The
Company's own Construction and Technical Departments will be responsible for
the relocation of existing machinery. Similar arrangements have proven
satisfactory in the Company's past expansions. The project can be implemented
without interfering with existing production until final equipment erection
and relocation of existing machinery. The financial projections assume a
minimal production loss of one month in 1975.

E.   Project Timing
4.14      Project completion is planned for the last quarter of 1975 in accor-
dance with the implementation schedule shown in Annex 4-4. This schedu'Le is
considered realistic. Construction of the new production bays has already
begun and is expected to be completed by October 1974. Design and engineering
of the equipment for the project is well advanced. Orders for equipment with
delivery times of more than 18 months are already being placed and will be
financed by the Company. Procurement action for foreign equipment to be
financed by the Bank has been initiated. It is expected that the first firm
orders for Bank financed equipment will be placed in April 1974.
V.  CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A.   Project Cost
5.01      The capital cost of the project is detailed in Annex 5-1 and summarized
below:

- 19 -
5.02      Civil construction costs are based on the contract signed in May
1973 with RATKO MITROVIC (para 4.13). Equipment cost estimates are derived
from actual prices prevailing in 1973 and from quotations received in the
last quarter of 1972 or first half of 1973 from potential European and US
suppliers. The prevailing import duties and taxes on the cif value (Yugoslav
border) of imported equipment have been added. The estimates for engineering,
pre-operating and start-up expenses reflect IMT's recent experience.
5.03      The cost estimates include physical contingencies equivalent to
10% for civil construction and equipment to be purchased from hard currency
countries, 2% for equipment from clearing countries and 3% for locally
procured equipment based on the assumptions detailed in Annex 5-1. These
provisions are considered adequate in view of the advanced stage of project
preparation and ITT's familiarity with the equipment to be procured. In
addition, price contingencies equivalent to an escalation rate of 6% per
annum have been applied to the cost of foreign equipment includJnzg import
duties and taxes. As for local equipment, construction and erection costs,
escalation rates have been forecast declining from 10% to 6% per year during
the construction period. These rates are based on the assumption that the
measures now  __   taken in Yugoslavia to curb inflation will succeed.  Assumed
physical and price contingencies, therefore, amount to 17.8% of total fixed
assets, a proportion not unlike those used for the Kikinda and FOB foundry
projects. The capital cost escimates are considered satisfactory.
B.   Working Capital
5.04      The Company's present working capital is satisfactory.  Incremental
working capital required due to the project for the 1973-76 period is estimated
at Din 380.7 million (US$24.6 million) and will be covered by a Din 30 million
--sum-term loan and a Din 300 million long-term loan from Belgrade Bank.
Details of IMT's working capital needs are given in Annex 5-2. Should actual
working capital requirements be higher than anticipated, the Company is
expected to finance them with short-term credits.
C.   Financing Plan
5.05      An estimated Din 1,356.9 million (US$87.6 million) will be required
to cover the project cost, including Din 123.0 million (US$7.9 million) for
interest during construction. Internal cash generation will provide Din 323.5
million (24% of the total), credits from the Belgrade Bank Din 714.3 million
(53%), credits from local suppliers Din 17.2 million and credits from clear-
ing countries Din 15.2 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$18.5 million
would cover the remaining 21% of the financing requirements, equivalent to
about 75% of the equipment cost. A summary of sources and applications
of funds (Annex 7-2) follows:

5.06      The Bank loan would be for 14 years, including a grace period of
3 years, at an assumed interest rate of 7-1/4% plus a guarantee fee of 1-3/4%,
payable to the Republic of Serbia 1/, thus bringing the effective Bank lend-
ing rate to IMT to 9%. The loan agreement, already signed, between IMT and
the Belgrade Bank stipulates 11% interest per annum for a period of 14 years
including 3 years of grace; it also provides a guarantee for the IBRD loan.
5.07      Agreements on the local suppliers' and bilateral credits from clear-
ing countries are currently being completed. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that the Company will receive guarantees from the Belgrade Bank
for these loans on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.

overrun or a shortfall in cash generation, would be provided by the Belgrade
Bank on terms acceptable to the Bank. The Company provided documentary
evidence of this completion and overrun guarantee during negotiations.
5.09      The proposed Bank loan of US$18.5 million equivalent would cover
the cost of approxinately 75% of the equipment and spare parts. It would
finance the cif cost of imported goods and the ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured equipment and spares. A detailed list of the items to be procured
under the Bank loan is shown in Annex 5-3. These items will be divided into
76 packages, all of which will be submitted to international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. For the
purpose of bid comparison, bids containing at least 20% domestic value added
will be given the standard preference of 15% or actual customs duty whichever
is less.
5.10      For most of the domestic equipment (estimated at Din 111.5 nillion
to be financed by the Comnany, suppliers' credits or loans from the Belgrade
Bankc), quotations have already been received from various suppliers and
orders are now being placed. This equipment will be of the requisite quality,
competitively rriced and supplied in accordance with the requirements of
the project i-'-ementation schedule. As to equipment imported from clearing
countries (estimated at Din 22.0 million), the Company intends partly to
invite bids from selected Eastern European suppliers and partly to rely on
sole source procurement.
5.11      Tne escimated disbursement schedule for the Bank loan is showr in
Annex 5-4. It is based on detailed estimates of order placements, pavment
schedules and expected delivery times for equipment in line with the construc-
tion schedule kAnnex 4-4).
VT. REVENUF, SU?PLIES AND OPERATING COST
A    Escalation ir, the Financial Projections
6.01      To provide a reasonably accurate picture of IMT's liquidity position
during the forecast period, the Bank's financial projections have been
expressed in current terms. Expected rates of cost increases were discussed
with the Comoany and Yugoslav authorities and assume that the measures now
being taken in Yugoslavia to curb inflation will succeed. The financial pro-
jections assume (i) a 12.3% per annum increase of wage rates until 1978 and
8% per annum thereafter (Annex 6-3, page 2), (ii) escalation of material costs
by 6% per year, and (iii) price increases as set out in Annex 6-1, page 2.
Depreciation and financial charges are not escalated, since they relate to
capital costs that remain on the books at historical values. The assumed
price increases of 8% in 1974 and 6% in 1975 are realistic, but subsequent
price assumptions for the 1976-1983 period are conservative in relation to
operating cost increases and intended to demonstrate that IMT can remain
financially viable even if its prices rise at a slower rate than the average
rate of the Company's operating costs.

B.   Sales Revenues
6.02      The implementation schedule foresees the start-up of (i) the tractor
assembly plant in August 1975, (ii) the implement assembly shop in November
1975, and (iii) full production of the tractor parts machine plant by the
end of 1975. The projected sales prices and revenue build-up are shown in
Annex 2-3, para 8 and Annex 6-1, and are summarized below:

/1   Construction period.
6.03      Sales revenues have been calculated in current terms acording to
the escalation rates detailed in Annex 6-1, page 2. As sales incentive, the
Company intends to sell its 1976 production at 1975 prices and increase the
dealer discount from 3.25% to 3.8%. Due to the expansion project net sales
will increase by 57% in 1975 (over 1974) and another 66% in 1976 reaching
Din 3,045 million.
6.04      Presently, exports to convertible and clearing areas account for
about Din 53.8 million or 5% of total sales. The share of exports is expected
to rise to 8.9% in 1977, of which Din 132.7 million (3.9%) would be to
convertible currency countries and Din 174.3 million (5%) to the clearing
area. Export projections have been based on the expected domestic market
for IMT's products which receives priority and the export revenues required
to earn a certain retention quota (Annex 2-7, para 17). In view of the
Company's competitiveness on the world market (Annex 3), the export projec-
tions understate the actual export potential.

6.05      Timely economical supply of raw material (steel), parts (engines,
forgings, castings, tires, bearings, etc) and supplies are crucial for IMT's
production which is primarily a machining and assembly operation. The Company
is taking adequate measures, detailed in Annex 6-2, to minimize bottlenecks
during and after expansion. Major items such as engines, castings, pressings
and wheels are supplied by other 13141 member companies which have coordinated
their respective production programs. Imports of materials amount at present
to no more than 7-10% of total material costs and are projected to decrease to
around 5-8% by 1976. 1/ No problems are foreseen in regard to the Yugoslav
import regime and the availability of foreign exchange for imports of raw
materials and components. As detailed in Annex 7-4 and Annex 8-2, I141 is
expected to have adequate foreign exchange to meet possible shortfalls in
domestic raw materials and parts supply through imports.
D.   0p erating Costs
6.06      Operating cost projections are detailed in Annex 6-3 and summarized
below. IMT's internationally competitive cost structure is in large part
the result of prevailing low wage rates in Yugoslavia; i.e., in 1972 MTT's
labor cost amounted to 14.5% of total operating cost compared to 25-30% in
Western European companies with a similar product mix.

1/   At present imported components for the standard 533-558 models amount
to about 4% of material cost compared to 45% for the 575/585 models
(Annex 6-7).



- 24 -
6.07      TNT's supnlv and operating cost situation is not expected to be
substantially affected by the current energy shortage. Yugoslavia's power
stations rely primarily on domestic natural gas and lignite and hydropower.
In addition Yugoslavia imports 3.0 million tons per year of oil (approximately
25% ,f total consumption) from the USSR. As to potential direct and indirect
cost increases, the Company should be in a good position to absorb such
increases, since (i) energy costs amount to only 3% of IMT's operating costs,
and (ii) nearly 90% of LMT's raw materials and finished products are obtained
from and sold .o local suppliers and customers.
6.08      Because the project would expand in-house machining and implements
production capacity the Company's value added is expected to increase from
22% in 1972 to 27% in 1977. Unit costs for the standard tractor models (TMT
533/558) are estimated to go up by 28% during 1972-77, which is equivalent
to a 3% cost decrease in constant prices. Economies of scale in the manu-
facture of tractors accrue mainly in the production of components. Therefore,
by expanding its tractor production capacity from 15,000 units to 35,000 units
per year, IMT is unlikely to reduce its operating cost in real terms by more
than 3-5% during the first 5 years after project completion, because (i) InT
will continue primarily to machine and assemble components produced by
suppliers that account for nearly 90% of material cost; (ii) administration
and selling expenses per unit will remain at the present level, since IMT
has to strengthen its marketing, development and production scheduling
activities; and (iii) the profit margin for the new 20-25 hp and over 100 hp
models will be in the 2-5% range as compared to approximately 10% for the
standard models (Annex 6-3). The Company realizes that the profit margins
for the newly introduced models will be less than for the standard type. The
reason for IMT's producing both 20-25 hp tractors and above 100 hp units is
prompted by the Company's goal to establish itself in all segments of the
tractor market so as to be in a position to react rapidly to changed in demand
by the farmers.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Future Profitability
7.01      Detailed income and cash flow forecasts through 1983 are shown in
Annexes 7-1 and 7-2, and selected items are summarized below:

- 25 -
7.02      IMT's net income which was Din 73.3 million in 1972 was expeeted
to rise to Din 78.6 million in 1973; the increase of depreciation charges
due to the completion of the interim expansion (12,000 tractors to about
15,000 tractors/ year) was offset by additional sales proceeds.  As a
result of the project, net income is projected to go up to Din 129.3
million in 1976 and reach Din 231.3 million in 1977. The fact that net
income increases less rapidly than sales after the start-up of the project
in late 1975 and even declines after 1977 in absolute terms is due to (i)
the higher escalation rates assumed for production cost inputs as compared
to selling prices, and (ii) the 10% increase of depreciation charges in
1980 after the completion of the Phase II expansion (para 4.02), which would
not result in notable capacity increases or cost reduction. Since a major
portion of net income after taxes will be needed to help finance the proj-
ect, agreement was reached during negotiations that the Company will -
until the project is completed - distribute income to its workers only
to the extent that annual depreciation plus allocations to the Business
Fund during that period would cover the requirements of the project.
B.   Financial Position
7.03      Balance sheet projections for 1973-1983 are contained in Annex 7-3
and significant indicators given below. For comparison purposes, IMT's
income statements and balance sheet projections without the proposed expansion
are given in ALnexes 7-1 and 7-3 respectively.

Debt/Equity Ratio       16:84  25:75  56:44  53:47  44:56  30:70  20:80
7.04      The Company's long-term debt/equity ratio, which was satisfactory
in 1972, is expected to rise during project implementation to a maximum of
56:44 in 1975. Thereafter, as full production is reached following completion
of the expansion, repayment of loans causes steady improvements in the
debt/equity ratio and, by 1981, IMT will have only 20% in debt. This proj-
ected ratio is based on the assumption that the Company by 1978/79 will have
proceeded with implementation of Phase II and that there will be no income
distribution to the workers in excess of the 12.3% annual increase in
earnings per emnloyee until 1978 and 8% thereafter.



- 26 -
7.05      The Company's liquidity position remains satisfactory throughout
the life of the project. As is the normal practice in Yugoslavia, net profits
in excess of the funds required for the project or for operations would be
distributed to the workers. In order to maintain the Company's sound
financial position, agreement was reached during negotiations that IMT will
not, without the prior consent of the Bank, (i) distribute and/or make cash
outlays other than for normal operations if the current ratio were to fall
below 1.3:1 in any year after such income distribution and/or cash outlay;
(ii) undertake, until the completion of Phase II, additional capital invest-
ments in excess of Din 50 million equivalent in any one year other than for
the project and `'hase II; and (iii) incur, until the completion of Phase II,
any indebtedness'in excess of Din 50 million equivalent in any one year other
than for the project. In addition, it was agreed, that, after the completion
of Phase II, IMT will not undertake any investment or assume any indebtedness
in amounts exceeding in any one calendar year Din 120 million equivalent
without prior consultation with the Bank.
C.   Financial Rate of Return and Major Risks
7.06      The project provides an incremental financial rate of return of
21.0% at real prices. Detailed assumptions for the calculation and the
incremental cost/benefit streams are given in Annex 7-4.
7.07      An analysis has been carried out to determine the sensitivity of
the projected rate of return to various changes in basic assumptions. The
results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Annex 7-4 and summarized
below:
Sensitivity Test on Financial Rate of Return
Case                           Description                     Rate of Return (M)
1       Base Case                                                  21.0
2       Six Months Delay in Project Completion                      17.3
3       Capital Cost Increase 10%                                   18.3
4       Operating Cost Increase 10%                                  3.1
5       Sales Revenue Decrease 10%                                 -1.6
7.08      The sentivity tests indicate the type of financial risk associated
with investments in assembly operations such as IMT: (i) the project is not
capital intensive, so that a capital cost increase of 10% results only in a
drop of the rate of return to 18.3%, (ii) the return, on the other hand, is
extremely sensitive to changes in operating costs and sales revenues. If
operating costs were to increase by 10%, which could mean either a 12.5%
increase of material cost or a 50% increase of labor cost, the rate of return
would drop to 3.1%. However, the probability of a significant cost increase
for materials and parts without at least partially offsetting price increases
of IMT products is low.



- 27 -
7.09      If revenues drop by 10%, ceteris paribus, the return would become
negative. Such a case is also very unlikely to happen since, as mentioned
above, there is a direct correlation between tractor and component prices.
A revenue drop of 10% would be likely only if accompanied by a drop in
materials and parts prices, which would go a long way towards restoring the
financial rate of return to at least 10-12%. If, however, the drop in sales
revenue was caused by a slackening of demand and a consequent reduction in
sales volume, the Company would cut back its production of tractors and imple-
ments. Since variable costs account for over 70% of total operating costs, a
reduction in outpuit to 90% of rated capacity would not decrease the financial
rate of return below 10%. Clearly, the financial risk of the project depends
to a high degree on IMT's management, esDecially its ability to control
operating costs, react to shifts of demand and maintain the leverage to pass
on cost increases to consumers under competitive conditions. The financial
risk of the project is acceptable in view of the Company's satisfactory
management (Annex 2-1) and favorable cost structure comPared to international
standards (para 6.08 and Annex 6-2).
D.   Debt Service Coverage
7.10      The 1-'ng-term debt service coverage based on the above financial
projections and the proposed financing plan is adequiate. It falls to a low
of 1.9 times covered in 1979, because of the high repayment obligation for
medium and long-term loans during those years. The subsequent rise of the
debt-service coverage is offset by decreasing net income.
Debt-Service Coverage Projections

/1   First year Qif repayment of Bank loan.
7.11      In addition to traditional debt-service coverage, IMT is required,
according to Yugoslav regulations, to generate sufficient foreign exchange
in convertible currencies to service its convertible currency debt. Funds
available to the Company up to 1983 and IMT's convertible currency requirements
for interest and amortization are shown in Annex 7-5. Analysis indicates that
there would be sufficient accumulated funds to meet projected needs, but hard
currency funds generated by the Company in 1975 and 1978 barely match those
years' requirements. The Belgrade Bank agreed during negotiations that it
will make foreign exchange funds available to the Company to the extent that
the convertible currency generated by INT through retention and depreciation
quotas is insufficient to meet the Company's convertible currency debt
service obligations.
E.   Break-even Points
7.12      In 1978, the first full year of repaymeit of the Bank loan,
the profit break-even point would be about 80% of the Company's production



- 28 -
program, which is equivalent to 28,175 tractors and a proportionate mix of
accessories, implements and parts.  The cash break-even point in 1978 will
be slightly lower than the profit break-even point in that year, since annual
depreciation is higher than debt repayment. Further details on break-even
are given in Annex 7-6.
F.   Auditing Requirements
7.13      The Company's accounting system follows Yugoslav regulations and
procedures for accounting and economic/financial indicators. The accounts
of Yugoslav enterprises are reviewed annually by the Social Accounting Service
(SAS). The review primarily ensures that the enterprises' financial tran-
sactions comply with Yugoslav law, but does not represent an audit in the
normal sense nor does SAS provide a report on the accounts. SAS has initiated
a training program under which its staff will be trained by Coopers & Lybrand
of the U.K. in auditing methods consistent with Bank requirements. During
negotiations it was agreed that the Company will invite SAS to undertake an
annual audit of its 1974 and 1975 accounts as part of SAS's on-the-job training
program in collaboration with Coopers & Lybrand. In the event that SAS is not,
thereafter, able to achieve a consistent and satisfactory standard of auditing,
IMT would retain, if the Bank so requested, an experienced independent
auditing firm.
VIII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A.   Economic Rate of Return
8.01      Economic projections have been made in real value terms and are
given in Annex 8-1. Costs have been based on the financial estimates with
adjustments for taxes and duties. In view of the present and projected
economic situation in Yugoslavia, no shadow pricing of labor and foreign
exchange rates has been emnloyed. The calculation of sales revenues takes
into account import prices (excluding taxes and duties) of comparable tractors
and agricultural implements. The incremental economic rate of return for
the project is about 16% in real terms. Economic sensitivity tests are
illustrated in Annex 8-1. Because of the lower level of economic operating
cost and benefits the economic rate of return is slightly less sensitive to
operating and sales revenue changes than the financial rate of return. A
10% increase in capital cost lowers the economic return to 12.2%; a com-
bination of 10% higher capital costs and 10% higher operating costs would
reduce the return to 0.8% and a 10% loss in sales revenues would result in
a negative economic rate of return. Nevertheless, the probability of
operating cost changes without counteracting revenue changes is low, so
that under foreseeable circumstances the economic rate of return is likely
to be in the 8-15% range.
B.   Farm Mechanization and Agricultural Development
8.02      During the past decade agricultural development in Yugoslavia
was disappointing (Annex 3): (i) total crop production fluctuated without
regaining the high 1961 level: and (ii) the agricultural trade surplus dropped



- 29 -
continually during the sixties when Yugoslavia had to import large quantities
of food grain and feed for livestock. Furthermore, the Yugoslav agricultural
situation was aggravated by the loss of farm labor, since an estimated
500,000 peonle from rural areas migrated to Western Europe.
8.03      To reduce the need for imports and increase agricultural output and
productivity, the Republics and Autonomous Provinces have recently concluded
an Agreement for the Development of Agriculture, "Green Plan". The Plan
stresses farm mechanization and modern agricultural methods as a means to
achieving greater productivity both in the social and private sectors.
8.04      The IMT expansion project is important for the smooth implementa-
tion of the "G7reen Plan".  It will permit an increase in import substitution
for tractors and agricultural implements, which minimizes the cost to the
farmer and the economy as a whole. In addition, the Company has an established
sales and services network (Map IBRD 10716), which can facilitate the channel-
ing of credit. If the demand for new tractors were met entirely from imports,
this would not only result in a substantial drain of foreign exchange to the
economv, but would also continue the proliferation of types and makes of
imported tractors and agricultural implements. This, in turn, would make
the provision of adequate service facilities more difficult.
C.   Employment Effects
8.05      As detailed in Annex 4-3, the project creates directly 1,440 Jobs
at an investment cost of US$36,000 per employee which compares favorably with
about US$60,000 per employee in similar factories in the IJ.S. and Western
Eturope. The Company selected relatively labor-intensive production methods
for the project, since Yugoslav enterprises have a substantial comparative
labor cost advantage. For example, at present the average wage rate per
man-hour in IMT is US$0.70 as compared with US$3.50 in the Federal Republic
of Germany.
8.06      In addition to the direct creation of new employment, the project
has backward and forward linkages which contribute significantly to Yugoslav
employment. As for forward linkages, rapid farm mechanization can maintain
sustained agricultural growth in the face of the diminishing agricultural
labor force, and will cause tractor dealers and service stations to recruit
additional personnel. In regard to existing backward linkages expansion of
an assembly-type operation such as IT4T is characterized by growth and employ-
ment stimulating effects on suppliers and sub-suppliers. Furthermore, the
Company intends to procure locally nearly 95% of its requirement of raw
material, Darts and supnlies after project completion thtus concentrating
indirect emplovment creation almost exclusively in Yugoslavia.
D.   Foreign Exchange Effect
8.07      Faced with the mounting debt service obligations on short and
medium-term suppliers' credits, and an increasing gap in the balance of
trade, Yugoslavia has a critical need to raise its foreign exchange earnings
from exports. The direct net foreign exchange earnings of the project are
given in Annex 8-2. They are estimated to amount to Din 1,728 million



- 30 -
(lJS$111 million) over the 1973-1983 period or an average of US$10 million a
year. The annual figure implies that the foreign exchange component of
capital investment in the project, US$24.6 million, will be covered in about
2-1/2 years of operation. Furthermore, the Yugoslav economy realizes consider-
able foreign exchange savings. If IMT were not to expand, the incremental
domestic demand for tractors would have to be met from imports. Foreign
exchange savings for 1977 have been estimated at Din 340 million (US$22 million),
so that the total net foreign exchange effect in that year would amount to
Din 505 million (US32.6 million).
IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
9.01      During negotiations the following assurances and agreements were
reached with the Yugoslav Government, the Belgrade Bank and the Company.
A.   The Belgrade Bank will, on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank:
(1)  provide a project completion and overrun guarantee
(para 5.08);
(2) make foreign exchange funds available to the Company
in the event the latter's foreign exchange funds are
not sufficient to cover its obligations (para 7.11);
(3) guarantee local suppliers' and bilateral credits on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para
5.07).
B.   IMT will:
(1) introduce and maintain appropriate industrial safety
practices (para 2.10);
(2) submit to the Bank by mid-1975 a 5-year program for
financing sales of IMT tractors and agricultural
implements, which would support IMT's production
program in the long-run, and provide information on
ways and means of channeling the required funds to
private farmers as well as the social sector (para
3.16);
(3) submit to the Bank by mid-1975 a 5-year program for
the expansion of its local and export marketing and
servicing organization (para 3.23);



- 31 -
(4) provide information on a regular basis on the status of
product developmnent of the 20-25 hp tractor and the
above 100 hp tractor (para 4.05);
(5) allocate adequate internally generated funds for the
project (para 7.02);
(6)  observe certain financial covenants to maintain a
sound financial position (para 7.05);
(7) arrange for an external audit (as specified in para
7.13).
9.02      Based on the foregoing commitments and agreements, the project
provides a sound basis for a loan to IMT of US$18.5 million equivalent for
14 years, including a 3-year grace period.

YUGOSLAVIA - TIT TRACTOR EXPANSION PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING FACILITIES
1.        IIT's existing facilities are:
a)   the main production unit "IMT Tractor and Agricultural
Machinery Factory"; located in the new industrial
area of Belgrade (population 1.2 million) about 12 km from
the city center. The total labor force of 2,900 pro-
duces tractors, tractor implements, accessories and
spare parts (for detailed production program see Annex
2-3).
b)   "PfK-M1otorcultivator and Agricultural Machinery Factory,
Knjazevac"; located on the outskirts of Knjazevac,
Serbia, about 280 km southeast of Belgrade and 40 km
from Zajecar near the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border (see
Section B below and Map IBRD 10716);
c)   the PIT Service Center--Dobanovci; located in Dobanovci
about 15 km northwest of Belgrade and conveniently linked
to its service area by highway and rail (See Section C
below and Map IBRD 10716.
A.   ItT Factory Belgrade
2.        According to new zoning regulatious dated January 1, 1973,
DIT's total property in Belgrade (168,500 m ) has been earmarked as an in-
dustrial area.  About 190 families have been living in small houses on the
plant site. They will be relocated and the houses dismantled as soon as
feasible.
3.        TMT's production processes focus on machining operations, heat
treatvient, nainting and assembly. Castings, forgings, stampings, electri-
c;il e(oquiptmient, hvdraulic .accessories, tires, hardware and other components
are suDolieed by local and foreign sub-contractors.  Consequently, the plant
consists of three main production units--the tractor parts machine shop, the
tractor assembly shop and the implements production shop--which are located
in separate buildings, as shown in the plant layout (Annex 4-2). The exist-
ing principal facilities of the INT Belgrade factory include:
a)   the main building (18,000 m 2; constructed in 3954 and
housing the tractor parts machine 2hop (9,800m'),
the tractor assembly shop (5,665 m ), storage areas,
the cafeteria and offices for the sales and services,
production planning & inventory control departments.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
b)   the implements production shop (7,480 m ); located on
FOB's property and which has to be dismantled by 1975
to make room for FOB's expansion.
c)   several small single storey; ho2ses built during 1940-
1948 and covering about 8,130 m , with offices for the
industrial engineering, finance, personnel and develop-
ment departments.
2
.l)   8 separated sheds (7,879 m ); without heating and tech-
nical equipment, for the storage of raw material and
components, and an open storage area for finished goods.
2
e)   the annex building( 8,641 m ); housing the maintenance shop,
laboratory, social services and instruction room and
garage.
To achieve the current production target of 15,850 tractors/year,
the heat treatment installation is operated on a 3-shift basis, whereas all
other production facilities operate on 2 - 2-1/2 shifts per day.
Tractor Parts r4achine Shop
4.        The machine silop is divided into heavy and light machine sections,
the tool room, the heat treatment installation and surface protection facil-
ities. Machining of hydraulic pump components is handled in an attached
annex building. I'eat treatment and surface protection facilities are used
for tractor parts as well as implement parts.
5.        'achining is carried out by 333 machine tools of which 65 are
high-productivity machines and 68 are obsolete. Because of lack of space
and machine tools the operations are arranged in 21 lines. This leads to
machining of technically dissimilar parts on the same line and so results
in increased mnachining and set-up time. During the 1972 production capac-
ity expansion from 12,000 to 15,000 tractors/year, new machine tools (worth
Din 43 million) were installed. However, the floor area was increased by
only 720 m , aggravating the already overcrowded conditions in the machine
shop.
6.        Trumpet Potusing Machining.  After loading and transporting of the
components on roller conveyors from the transit store to the machine shop,
the operation consists of (a) rough machining of flanges and bores, i.e.,
the final machining of bores, and (b) drilling of flange holes on two way
multi-spindle radial drills. This system requires 10 machines, 7 workers
and 8 minutes machine time/trumpet housing, which is inefficient. A transfer
line for trumpet housing machining can decrease the required machining time
to 5.2 minutes/trumpet housing, including inspection, and will be installed in
the project.

7.        Hleat treatment of tractor and implement parts requires carburation,
nitridina, induction hardening, straight hardening and washing. In 1972, a
new Degussa carburation furnace and ignition hardening equipment were in-
stalled, resulting in the following capacities for the existing heat treatment
facilities:
tons/year
Gas Carburation
--Degussa                                   600
-- Chambered furnaces                     1,000
Ignition Hardening                             300
Nitriding                                       80
Direct quenching                            1,500
Rotating furnaces and
quenching presses                         1,100
Iiiu, Ltion Hlardening                        500
Sand blasting                               2,800
Annealing                                   2,500
Salt Baths                                    600
This capacity will be insufficient for IMT's production volume
after implementation of the proposed project. The facilities will then
remain at the present site and be used for treatment of implement parts only.
8.        Observations.  The production bay has been repaired many times,
the roof leaks, heating and electrical lighting are tnsufficienit and
inadequate ventilation in the heat treatment area creates unhealthy condi-
tions. Besides bad working conditions the major production bottlenecks are
(a) lack of space for storing parts before and during machining and (b) over-
crowded arrangements of the machine lines. Machined parts pile up in the
working and transport areas and impede the production flow.
Equallv, for lack of space, a number of heavy machines have had to
be installed in the light machine area, resulting in increased machine and
comnponents movement. In addition, the nickel and chrome plating sections
are overloaded for the present production capacity.
The facilities of the tractor parts machine shop, including floor
space, machine tools, inside and outside storage, are presently being used
to the maximum extent and do not allow any further increase of production
without expansion.
Tractor Assembly Shop
9.        Ti-e tractor assembly shop located in the main production bay
consists of two paint and drying shops, the main assembly line and six sub-
assemblv lines. The flow chart in this Annex shows the present assembly
system [or an annual production of 15,000 tractors. The assembly line pro-
duces one IYT-533 tractor every seven minutes.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 6
10.       Observations.  Although the assembly procedure is acceptable for
a 15,000 units/year tractor production, the present facilities have been
stretched to a riaxirnum and it will not be possible to achieve any signifi-
cant ir,crease in the present production volume. The major bottleneck is
inadequate internal transport of tractor parts and the lack of a proper con-
veyor system between the auxiliary and main lines also: (a) Storage space
for production components is lacking, as sheet metal components are trans-
ferred by overhead conveyor lines; (b) There is insufficient space for sub-
assembly lines, inefficient placing of tools and no systematic feeding of
sub-assemblies through conveyors to the main line. Conditons particularly
in the paint shop, do not meet minimum health standards:  (a) the  paint
booths have no fluid curtain (water fall) system for absorption of spray and
possible recycling of paint and (b) there is no airconditioned, dust-proofed
cabin for the hydraulic pump and system.
Tractor Attachment and Implement Production Shop
11.       Tractor impleients and accessories are produced in the temporary
production bay (7,480 m ) on FOB's property. For heat treatment, surface
protection and painting the facilities in the main production building are
used. The implement shop is crowded and lack of space impedes a more pro-
ductive work organization and higher productivity. To achieve an increased
production volume a reorganization of the material flow and assembly lines
of all implement types as well as additional floor space and equipment are
mandatory.
Quality Control
12.       The present quality control systems consist of (a) inspection of
purchased raw materials and supplies by sampling, (b) control of 5 products
from 20 work places per hour and (c) final inspection. The material flow
of the existing assembly shops does not allow adequate quality control and
will be improved under the project. IMT owns machanical, physical, metallo-
graphic testing equipment which is located in FOB's laboratory.  The project
includes additional quality control and testing equipment which will be
needed for the increased production volume.
Scaffolding Production
13.       The Scaffolding is produced partly in the implement production
s1.-lp and partly in a separate building adjacent to the storage sheds. After
project implementation the implement production shop will be dismantled,
restricting scaffolding production to one building. Since no increase of
scaffolding output is planned for 1976 the project does not envisage any ex-
tension of the production facilities.

Storage and Other Facilities
14.       The existing storage facilities for raw materials and parts are
scattered over the property, consisting of an old building adjacent to the
tractor production shop and several small wooden sheds. For lack of space,
deliveries of raw material ana warts are dumped on internal roads, are piled up
in front of entrances to and between various buildings restricting the trans-
port on the factory site and requiring extensive cleaning before machining
and assembling.
15.       The existing general service facilities (locker-rooms, toilets,
cafeteria, meeting rooms, parking, etc.) and offices were planned and built
for a total labor force of 2,000. With regard to the present IMT labor force
of 2,900 men, these facilities are grossly inadequate and contribute to sub-
standard working conditions in the plant and office areas.
Utilities
16.       For details of existing and planned facilities, see Annex 4-1,
para. 22-27.
B.   FMK - Knjazevac
16.      FP1K - Motorcultivator and Agricultural Machinery Factory in
Knjazevac employs about 450 people and produces motorcultivators in the 5-
9 hp range, a 2-axle (18.5 hp) tractor and a variety of implements under
license from the West German Company "AGRIA WERKE" (for detailed production
program see Annex 2-3, para. 4).
17.       In 1971 DIT began an expansion of the existing facilities of
FMK investing Din 41.2 million in fixed assets.  Building construction and
erection of new machines are scheduled to be completed by December 1973 and
will increase FMK's capacity of motor cultivators, small tractors and the
required number of implements.
18.       The factory located on a 13,000 m  site consists of a 6,400 m
production shop, an open storage area for raw materials and parts, adequate
restaurant, office and services areas, a garage and ambulance annex, covered
finished goods store (1,000 m2), boiler and transformer station and special
storage facilities for storage of inflammable liquids.  After completion of
the project facilities at FYK will be adequate and are not expected to require
any additional investment during the eighties.
C.   PIT Service Center-Dobanovci
19.       The service center in Dobanovci was founded in 1954 and merged
with IMT in 1956. The service and repair facilities were expanded during
the 1966-1968 period and presently employ about 170 people. The produc-
tion program includes:

YUGOSLAVIA - IMT TRACTOR EXPANSION PROJECT
ORGANIZATIONAL AND MANAGERIAL STRUCTURE
A.  IMT - UMI Relations.ip
1.        Industrija Masina I Traktora (IMT) is approximately the fiftieth
largest industrial company is Yugoslavia. In 1970 IMT, together with six
other metal manufacturing and processing enterprises located near Belgrade,
formed the Associated Metal Industry (Udrverna Metalska Industrija-UMI), which
is: now the 15th largest industrial group in Yugoslavia.
The following companies are members of the UMI group: (a) Iron
Foundry "FOB", Belgrade; (b) Diesel Engine Factory "IMR", Rakovica;
(c) Vehicle and Vehicle Parts Factory, "Ikarus", Zemun; (d) Agricultural
Machinery Industry, "Zmaj", Zemun; (e) Automobile Engine Factory "DMB",
Rakovica; (f) Manufacturer of Precision Instruments "IPM", Belgrade; and
(g) "IMT".
2.        UMI's main management body is the Workers' Council which includes
representatives of the seven member enterprises. The Workers' Council
guides and coordinates the activities of the member companies, while a Gen-
eral Manager is in charge of day-to-day operations.
A special committee formed by UMI's Workers' Council selects the
General Manager from candidates proposed by the Workers' Councils of the
member enterprises. An Executive Board assists the General Manager in draft-
ing the development and work programs of UMI and determining the use of UMI
funds. At present, the administrative staff consists additionally of a
secretariat, a planning division, a development division and a division for
financial analysis which prepare long-term, medium-term and yearly plans for
UMI member companies.
3.        UMI's operations are financed, inter alia, by Joint Reserve Funds
and Joint Development Funds created by contributions of member companies.
In 1970 each firm contributed a certain percentage of its net income to the
Joint Reserve Fund and 0.3% of the 1969 Business Fund to the Joint Development
Fund. However, subsequent annual payments have varied according to the rates
specified in UMI's annual economic plan. The Joint Reserve Fund provides
interest-free loans in order to help cover losses incurred by member companies.
The main objectives of the Joint Development Fund, on the other hand, are to
organize cooperative programs of research and development, conduct market
studies, and set up joint sales offices for the UKI group. This Fund could
also be used to provide interest-free loans to member firms for expansion
and development.



ANNEX 2-2
Page 2
4.        Currently, all annual investments by member companies of more than
one million Dinars require prior approval from UMI. Future developments will
show if this provision hinders the progress of orderly expansion or whether,
in contrast, it coordinates and facilitates common as well as individual ex-
pansion plans.
B.   IMT - Self-Management Organization
5.        The IMT enterprise consists of four entities which joined together
under a self-management agreement in March 1973. These are:
(i) the Tractor and Agricultural Implements Factory, New-Belgrade;
(ii) the Workers' Restaurant, New-Belgrade;
(iii) the Motorcultivator and Agricultural Implements Factory,
Knjazevac;
(iv) Service and Repair Center, Dobanovci.
The General Services Departments of the Tractor and Agricultural Implements
Factory, i.e., the Financial, Sales and Services, Development and Personnel
Departments, are in charge of the relevant activities in all four entities.
After completion of IMT's expansion project, it is planned to separate the
Tractor and Agricultural Implements Factory and establish two separate bodies
for Tractor Production and for Implements Production.
6.        As is common in Yugoslavia, IMT is managed internally by its workers.
Through this system workers participate both directly and indirectly in
decision making. The major organizational units for direct participation
are the Labor Units and the Workers' Assembly, whereas indirect participation
is guaranteed by the Workers' Councils and by the General Manager.
7.   Labor Units and Labor Units Council
Labor Units are departmental and functional units within the
enterprise. They have the right to determine the distribution of personal
income within the unit and sanction the unit's production targets. The
chief of every Labor Unit, as well as other directly elected members, form
the Labor Units Council which pays particular attention to work incentives,
productivity improvement and social standards. The Labor Units Council
is led by a President and Vice-President elected by its members.  In case
of dispute among the Labor Units, an arbitration commission is appointed
whose decision is final.
8.   Workers' Assembly
The Labor Units Council is responsible to the Workers' Assembly
of the relevant IDT entity, in which the employees participate directly in



ANNEX 2-2
Page 3
making decisions on key issues. This Assembly can be convened any time on
the initiative of at least one tenth of all workers.
9.   Workers'  Council
In the organizational framework of the Yugoslav self-management
system, the Workers' Council is the most important management body. The
Workers' Council of IMT has 45 members, elected proportionately from ITT's
four eatities. Each year, half the Council members are replaced by newly-
elected members who serve a two-year term. Nobody can be elected to the
Council for two consecutive termns. The Council determines the Company's
policy by approving major investments, the annual investment plan and the
appropriation of net income. In addition, its responsibilities include:
(a) coordination of IMT's development plans with those of the UMI group,
(b) decisions on business loans to UMI members, (c) organization of referenda
to decide key issues such as mergers, integration and technical cooperation
with other enterprises, change of location, and change of name, and (d)
election and dismissal of members of executive bodies, commissions to deal
with specific issues. The Workers' Council of IMT also forms special
committees such as the Immunity Commission, the Committees for Production
Problems, for Commercial-Economic Problems, and for Organizational-Judicial
Problems.
10. General Manager
The General Manager, as well as his deputy, are elected by the
Workers' Council on the basis of a publicly-announced open competition.
Election is for a four-year term with the possibility of re-election. The
Council sets up a committee to consider all applications and make recommen-
dations. Based on these recommendations, the Council elects the candidates
who are considered to be the best qualified. Minimum requirements for the
position of IMT's General Manager are (a) a university degree and six years
management experience, (b) a high school education combined with 12 years of
experience in management.
11.       The General Manager is independent in his day-to-day operations
and is responsible only to the Workers' Council. However, he can overrule
the decision of the Workers' Council only if its decision conflicts with
Yugoslav law. Any elected company official, and in particular the GCnera!
Manager and his deputy, can be relieved of their duties before the expira-
tion of their term if they have lost the confidence of the Workers' Coun-
cil.
12.       IMT's General Manager is assisted in his function by his deputy,
two Advisors, and the Collegium. The General Manager may also appoint an
Expert Council consisting of Company or outside experts if special problems
arise on which he seeks advice. The Collegium consists of IMT's General
Manager, his deputy, the Plant Managers of the four IMT entities and the
Directors of all departments of the Tractor and Agricultural Implements
Factory, New-Belgrade. They meet regularly once a week to discuss opera-
tional problems.

C.  Management
13.       The present General Manager of IMT is Radosilav Radovic, 42, a
mech-lnical engineering graduate of the University of Belgrade. He joined
IMT in 1950 and, prior to his selection as General Manager in June 1971,
has worked in various positions, including plant engineer, assembly line
manager, chief of production preparation and Director of tractor produc-
tion.
14.       The Deputy General Manager, Mr. R. Anastasijevic, 39, joined IMT
in 1953. He is an economist and was in charge of Spare Parts Service and
later the Export Division. After his election as Deputy General Manager in
March 1972 he has mainly been responsible for export-import arrangements,
foreign currency and commrcial-financial questions.
15.       The Directors of IMT's various departments were elected in June
1971 or March 1972 for a 4-year term. They report to the General Manager
and are responsible through him to the Workers' Council. The mission has
the impression that IMT can count on a competent and experienced management
team; specifically, the Financial Director, Mr. P. Dubajic, 40, the Director
for Production Planning and Control, Mr. D. Begus, 40, and the Director in
charge of the Expansion Project, Mr. M. Predragovic, 63.

YUGOSLAVIA - IMT TRACTOR EXPANSION PROJECT
ITT PRODUCTION AND PRODUCT LINE
Production History
1.        Iidu trija Masina i Traktora (IMT), of Belgrade, was founded in 1947,
but started manufacturing agricultural machinery only in .955 after acquiring
a iassey-Ferguson tractor license.  Until 1956, INT assembled TE 20 (20 hp)
tractors, but in 1957 changed over to MF-135 (35 hp) tractors. The initial
program of assembling imported tractor parts was gradually replaced by PKD-
CKD 1/ tractor production.
2.        The Company's engineers were trained in foreign Massey-Ferguson
plants and developed IMT's tractors on the basis of the licensing agreement.
However, the present IMT product line, although similar to the Massey-
Ferguson family, does not depend on licenses. The dependency on Massey-
Ferguson had decreased continuously when switching from PKD/CKD to act or
assembly to the purchase of specific components, and IMT's in-depend introduc-
tion of a 35-85 hp tractor line in 1969.  Thereidoes norw exist any manufactur-
ing relationship between IMT and Massey-Ferguson, in contrast IMT acts as
MF's sales and servicing agent in Yugoslavia. IMT's growth has been char-
acterized by the following product range developments and capacity expansions:
(a) First Expansion: In 1961, the IMT-533 tractor (35 hp)
was introduced and manufacturing facilities were expanded
to permit a production of 4,000 units/year, together with
spare parts and machine tools. During 1963-1964, IMT de-
veloped and began manufacture of a 50 hp tractor (IMT-555).
(b)  Second Expansion:  During 1966-68, MT's production capac-
ities were increased to 12,000 tractors/year, together with
implements and accessories. The product line included an
improved IMT-533 model, but the IMT-555 was discontinued
and replaced by a 55 hp model (IMT-558). In 1966, IMT de-
veloped its first series of agricultural machinery independ-
ently of the Massey-Ferguson licenses. The new product line
included 4 types of tractors IMT-533 (35 hp), IMT-555 (55 np),
IMT-575 (72 hp) and IMT-585 (80 hp), as well as a wide range
of tractor implements and accessories (see para 4). In ad-
dition, IMT assembled 100 hp Massey-Ferguson Tractors.
(c) Third Expansion (1971-1972) consisted of an increase of IMT's
production capacity from 12,000 tractors/year to 15,850 units/
year (see Annex 2-4), and additions to IMT's implements
product line.
3.        IMT's Belgrade plant maintained the following production schedule
during the 1968-73 period:-
1/   PDK - partly knocked down; CKD - completely knocked down.

During 1970-1972, FMK Knjazevac initiated an expansion program designed to
triple the company's capacity by 1975 (for details, see Annex 2-4, para 16-
18). From a manufacturing point of view, the IMT tractor models produced
in Belgrade incorporate a desirable degree of standardization and component
integration.



ANNEX 2-4
Page 4
7.        A detailed review of tractor design specifications does not suggest
specific improvements which need be incorporated at the present time. However,
changes may be needed on a continuing basis according to market demand and
farmers' preferences. IMT is aware of the need for on-going model improvement.
The Development Department is currently testing improved tractor features
(air brakes, safety cords) and has started the development of a road transport
gear box and a higher capacity hydraulic pump and system. The program of the
Development Department and the existing optional tractor specifications
indicate that IMT should be equipped to meet changing market requirements
by regularly introducing a number of design innovations.
Future Tractor Product Line
8.        The project proposes an increase of total tractor production in
Belgrade to 35,000 units per annum, as well as changes in product range and
product design improvements:

The product line changes and design innovations which have been tested and
will be introduced before project completion are:
(a) Partial replacement of the IMT-533 (35 hp) tractor by
the IMT-540 (42 hp) model and the IMT-558 (55 hp) by
the IMT-560 (60 hp). These additions involve minor
technical changes; e.g. Diesel engines with higher
rpm; newly styled head and rear lamps and sheel metal
parts (fenders, hoods, radiator cover, grill); the
introduction of higher hp models is a worldwide trend
in tractor marketing;
(b) improvement of models IMT-575 and IMT-585 by adding newly
styled sheet metal parts. Both models will continue to
have the same A-4.248 Perkins 4 cylinder 4 stroke Diesel
engine (72 hp at 2,000 rpm and 80 hp at 2,250 rpm);
1/ Completion of the assembly facilities in September, 1975.



ANNEX 2-4
Page 5
In addition, the project foresees the development and marketing of a new
20-25 hp tractor and of a tractor in the above 100 hp range.
9.        20 - 25 hp Tractor:  IMT intends to produce about 3,000 tractors
in the 20 - 25 hp range by 1976. IMT has, with the AGRIA 18.5 hp tractor
and the IMT-533, tractors up to 18.5 hp and of 35 hp but no unit in the
20 - 30 hp range. As indicated in the market analysis (Annex 3), an
important part of tractor demand by private farmers will be in this range.
IMT therefore intends to enter this market as soon as possible, in order to
build up its competitive position vis-a-vis the Pasquali tractor which "Ruen",
Macedonia, plans to assemble in Yugoslavia. From a marketing point of view,
the 20-25 hp tractor is an important addition to IMT's product line.
10.       As for the type of 25 hp tractor, IMT is considering to introduce
a) a special type of four-wheel tractor for vineyards and hop culture, and/or
b) a classic small tractor to be used in hill areas. The Company is still
discussing if the latter tractor should be a smaller version of its IMT-533
(35 hp) model or the Massey Ferguson 25 hp tractor which had been assembled
by IMT in the past. License negotiations with Massey Ferguson are currently
underway. A definite decision and development plan is expected by December
1973. In view of the work still required the production build-up and finan-
cial projections assume production of 1,500 tractors in the 25 hp range in
1976 and 3,000 units in 1977.
11.       Over-100 hp Tractors.  Since 1969, IMT has assembled a limited
number of Massey Ferguson 100 hp tractors. However, in 1976, ItT anticipates
the production of its own above-100 hp tractors. Prototype production for
the over 100 hp tractor is scheduled to begin in January 1974. The design
of the new tractor relies on maximum inter-changeability of parts with IMT's
85 hp tractor and includes the newly developed transmission case, pumping
and hydraulic system. The tractor will have a Perkins P6/354 engine which
is already in serial production in Yugoslavia (IMR, ZMAJ, 14 October). For
the proposed annual production of 400 over 100 hp tractors it is not econom-
ical to develop the required heavier gearlinks; therefore, IMT has initiated
negotiations to import this item from Danfors. Currently, domestic demand
for tractors in this horsepower range is entirely supplied by imports. IMT's
planned production volume of 400 tractors over 100 hp could fill about 70%
of domestic demand after 1976.
Tractor Implements and Accessories Production
12.       Implements:  IMT's implement production in 1973 consists of 3 - 5
ton trailers (6,000 units), rotavators (450 units), plows (1,500 units),
disc harrows and a small number of seed drills and cultivators. All imple-
ments that are being manufactured were developed by tMT, and their design



ANNEX 2-4
Page 6
and performance characteristics are good. Owing to lack of production capac-
ity, TNT manufactures only a limited number of implements needed for its
tractors. To assure an adequate level of implement availability for its
customers, IMT has established subcontracts and trade agreements with other
producers. In 1973, INT expects to realize Din 78.3 million through sales
of its own implements and about Din 120 million through sales of units
supplied by cooperating implement manufacturers.
13.       The 1976 manufacturing program proposes production of 16 types of
implements, totaling 27,700 units of various models, i.e., seed drill/
fertilizer planters (3 maize and 3 beet models), seed drill, trailer (2
models), mold board plow (11 models including 3 reversible types), disc plow
(3 models), disc harrow heavy duty (4 models), one gang disc harrow, offset
disc harrow, heavy duty mounted disc harrow (5 models), rotavator (3 models),
tillers (8 models). Owing to the high degree of integration of components,
the proposed production of such a variety of models should not pose any
problems. Although implement production will be tripled by the project, the
total volume detailed below will remain modest (about 1 implement per tractor):

14        In addition to the proposed implement line, IMT is considering to
developing and manufacturing such items as post hole diggers, cranes, jig
cranes, loaders, manure spreaders and grind mixers which could be powered by
LIT tractors.   To facilitate maximum utilization of Iff tractors, IMT is dis-
cussing the possibility of long-term agreements with other Yugoslav farm
implement manufacturers for development and supply of mowers, sprayers,
threshers and harvesters.
15.       Accessories:  The production of tractor accessories (pulleys,
draw backs, cabins, stabilizers, weights, seats) has increased fivefold
since 1968, but accounts for only 4.5% of ITT's 1973 projected sales.  The



ANNEX 2-4
Page 7
accessories are well designed and by 1976 IMT will supplement its prodlLct
line by a high speed road transport gear box and higher capacity hydraulic
and pump systems which are currently being developed. The proposed 1976
production program reflects IMT's tractor production increase and the
associated increase in demand for accessories:

Scaffolding
16.       IMT has traditionally been a producer of scaffolding.  Although
it does not directly fit into the Company's product line, IMT intends to
maintain the present production level in the future.
Spare Parts Production
17.       Spare parts amounting to an estimated Din 48.0 million or 4% of
total sales in 1973 have been a minor part of IMT's production program. Under
the project the company's spare parts production will increase according to
the requirements of the growing size of the IMT tractor fleet.  In addition,
the company believes there is significant export potential, particularly in
components for Massey-Ferguson tractors.

YUGOSLAVIA - IMT EXPANSION PROJECT
DEFINITION OF TERMS USED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A.   INCOME STATEMENT
1.        Depreciation of fixed assets has been calculated at the legal min-
imum rate of 7% until 1971. In view of the exceptional use of the facilities
by increasing tractor output from 12,000 to 15,000, IMT has adopted the fol-
lowing depreciation rates for the 1971-75 period:
(a)  Land                 0%
(b)  Buildings          3.5%
(c) Machine tools
and equipment    20.7%
(d) Transport
equipment         11.0%
(e)  Others            19.6%
However, after the completion of the expansion project new and existing fixed
assets will be depreciated at:
(a)  Land                 0%
(b)  Buildings          1.9%
(c) Machine tools
and equipment    14.0%
-d) Transport
equipment         10.0%
(e)  Others             6.4%
2.        Taxes and Contributions include (a) contributions to personal in-
come as decided annually by the Workers' Council, (b) transportation, rent
and vacation subsidies for employees, (c) a contribution for the Development
of Disaster-hit areas, amounting to 0.75% of the gross personal income and,
until December 1971, (d) a tax in form of a 3.5% interest payment on the
Business Fund.
B.   BALANCE SHEET
3.        Cash includes cash in hand, bank deposits and special funds for
small investment (e.g., for repairs and maintenance, etc.). The account in-
cludes funds which can only be used for current assets or for fixed assets
or can be exchanged into convertible currency.
4.        Receivables include receivables from domestic customers, advance
payment for imports not covered by commercial bank credits, and prepayments
for maintenance, worker's travel, etc.



ANNEX 2-7
Page 2
5.        Inventory includes raw materials and parts, semi-finished products,
fini-led products and stores. On December 31, 1971, inventories were re-
valuei as part of the general revaluation of assets.
6.        Gross Fixed Assets include land, buildings, machinery and equip-
ment, fixed assets under construction, license fees, etc. Under the
Yugoslav accounting system, interest during construction and pre-operating
and start-up expenses incurred by the Company are not capitalized; they are
shown as cost items and deducted from sales revenue in the income statement.
On December 31, 1971, there was a complete revaluation of fixed assets (ex-
cluding land).
7.        Depreciation:  The legal minimum depreciation rate on machinery
in Yugoslavia continues to be 7%. But since 1969 companies have been allow-
ed to use higher depreciation rates. IMT's past and future rates are given
in para. 15. The accumulated depreciation was also revalued on December 31,
1971.
8.        "Other Assets" include collective consumption assets (e.g., cash
from rent, credit to workers for housing, current value of assets such as
canteen, business office, etc.) and reserve fund assets.
9.        Financial Assets include investments in other enterprises, banks
and chambers of commerce as well as time deposits for more than 12 months,
such as (a) compulsory loans (see para. 13), and (b) the electric power
deposit, i.e., a long-term loan to the power authorities amounting to 20%
of any investment which is repaid after three years in 10 yearly installments.
10.       Accounts Payables to suppliers, and short-term credit from other
enterprises. Credits from commercial banks to cover receivables from
foreign buyers as well as to make advance payments on raw materials imports
for export production are excluded. (These items are netted out from both
sides of the balance sheet).
11.       Current Portion of Long-Term Debt includes repayment of principal
due within the next 12 months to creditors - both domestic and foreign.
12.       Long-Term Debt includes all outstanding debt (domestic and foreign)
excluding current maturities.
13.       Reserve Fund can be used to cover losses, to pay wages and salaries
to employees in case of liquidity problems and to comply with court decisions
to pay overdue debts. Annually, 2% of "Dahodak" (i.e., net sales minus cost
of materials, supplies, and utilities as well as depreciation is allocated to
the Reserve Fund from the net income ("Dobit").



ANNEX 2-7
Page 3
14.       Collective Consumption Fund receives minimum annual allocations
from net income of 4% of gross personal income. Higher allocations can be
decided upon by the Workers' Council. In case the net income does not cover
the legally required appropriations to the Collective Consumption and Reserve
Funds, the allocation to the Collective Consumption Fund has priority. In
case of losses, no appropriations are obligatory.
The Collective Consumption Fund is mainly used to build houses
and recreational facilities for workers, to meet travelling expenses during
vacations, to defray hospitalization charges and to pay scholarships. How-
ever, the Company can borrow without interest from this Fund up to one year
for the following purposes: (a) to pay wages and salaries in times of liquidity
problems; (b) to comply with court decisions to pay off overdue debts; and
(c) to finance inventories and short-term credit sales in case of working
capital shortage. In such cases of borrowing from the Pund, the Company has
to contribute 2% of the amount to the Fund for the Development of Under-
developed Regions.
15.       Compulsory Loans include since 1971 (a) a loan to the Yugoslav
State for the Development of Underdeveloped Regions. It amounts to 1.95% of
the Business Fund, and is to be repaid after 3 years in 8 equal installments
and at 4% p.a. interest, (b) a loan to the SFYR of 1.5% of the Business Fund,
and (c) until 1975, a loan to the Mutual Reserve Fund of 3.5% of the "DAHODAK."
These contributions to the Mutual Reserve Fund are at the disposal of th.e Local
and Provincial Government for industrial development. However, when a Com-
pany faces a severe working capital shortage and/or when it cannot get ade-
quate external resources for expansion, it can approach both the Local Commune
and the Provincial Government for loans. Credit to cover losses is not avail-
able from the Mutual Reserve Fund.
16.       Business Fund is comprised of net income, after appropriations to
the Reserve Fund, Collective Consumption Fund and Compulsory Loans. Con-
sequently, the Business Fund constitutes the main part of equity of an
operating company. At the end of 1971, the Business Fund was revalued along
with fixed assets. Business Fund appropriations are again earmarked for
current assets and fixed assets. From January 1, 1973 on, Yugoslav legislation
requires enterprises to finance at least 80% of their inventory by 1975 and
100% from 1976 through accumulated current asset appropriations to the Business
Fund, or through bank loans with at least five years maturity.
C.   SOURCES AND USES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE
17.       Retention Quota:  Yugoslav enterprises can use 20% of their annual
export earnings without restrictions.
18.       Depreciation Quota:  Companies can change 10% of their total annual
depreciation value into foreign exchange at the National Bank to repay and
service foreign credits and/or to import equipment and spare parts.

YUGOSLAVIA - IMT TRACTOR EXPANSION PROJECT
MARKET ANALYSIS
A. AGRICULTIURAL SETTING
1.        The Yugoslav agricultural sector contributed about 20% to GNP in
1972. Crop production 1/ has been declining during the sixties, but reached
the 1961 level of 57 million tons again in 1972. Yugoslavia is a traditional
exporter of agricultural Droducts. However, despite a steady increase of
farm prices, the value of agricultural exports fluctuated marginally around
Din 4 million during the 1965-1972 period. Beginning 1970 the agricultural
trade surplus decreased by more than 60% because of required import of feed
for livestock.
Regional Characteristics and Development
2.        Yugoslavia is predominantly a mountainous country.  Of the total
territory of 25.6 million hectares, 14.6 million hectares are recorded as
agriculturally productive, while the rest is taken up by forest, rivers and
lakes. The fertile plain of Vojvodina, Croatia and Slovenia in the north-east
represent only one-sixth of the country's total area, but contain nearly a
third of arable land and produce more than half of the country's output of
wheat and maize and over three-quarters of its sugarbeet. The hills (land up
to 500 meters in altitude) covering much of Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia are
important for livestock raising and fruit production.  The mountain region
covering 44 percent of the country is generally unfavorable for crop produc-
tion, but extensive un-land pastures make possible livestock raising. There
are considerable regional differences in yields, which may vary up to 100
percent for cereals between the less favored areas of Kosovo and Montenegro
and the most favored areas of Vojvodina, Slovenia and Croatia. The differences
are less pronounced for fodder crops and potatoes. In the breeding sector,
there are also wide disparities: in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Montenegro the
average weight of slaughtered cattle is only about half the national average.
Farm Population Trends
3.        Farm population has undergone a marked shift both in numbers and
structure. Following a worldwide trend, the Yugoslav agricultural labor
force is decreasing in absolute and relative terms because of migration to
urban areas and Western European countries.

Migration resulted in an increasing age of farm labor; for example, in 1971:
(i) 39% of the active males were over 50 years of age; and (ii) over 50%
of the fa;rms were without youths. In addition, the 1970 agricultural survey
showed that about 44% of the labor force living on farms had either permanent
or part-time employment off the farm. This indicates the difficulty of gene-
rating sufficient income to support a family on a holding.
The Social and Private Sector in Agriculture
4.        One of the important characteristics of Yugoslav agriculture is
the separate existence of two sectors viz, social and private with different
farm structures. The social sector has its origin in the postwar collectivi-
zation policy, and received further impetus by the Agrarian Reform of 1953,
which limited the size of private, individual holdings to 10 hectares of
cultivable land and 25 hectares of forest land, and brought 276,000 hectares
of additional land under the social sector. Since then, the land resources
of the social sector, consisting of: (i) agro-industrial "kombinats", (ii)
agricultural estates, and (iii) general agricultural organizations have almost
doubled due to reclamation, purchase and lease from private holders. The
social sector in 1972 held about 14.5 percent of the total arable land,
employed 4 percent of total agricultural manpower, produced 29 percent of the
agricultural product and 44 percent of the marketed production. The major
problems of social agricultural units at present are: (i) relatively high
monetary obligations, (ii) unsatisfactory equipment, and (iii) shortage of
skilled personnel.
5.        On the other hand, the private sector covers about 86 percent of
the cultivable land, and has 2.6 million individual holdings with an average
of 3.9 hectares per holding. It employs about 96 percent of the farm popu-
lation and accounts for 71 percent of the share of the agricultural product.
Due to inheritance customs, fragmentation has led to a decrease in average
farm size. However, only about 60 percent of the total land ir. the private
sector is in holdings of 5 - 10 hectares. At the same time about 50 percent
of the private holdings are in the mountainous regions where the conditions
are less favorable for agriculture. The main constraints of further develop-
ment of agriculture in the private sector are: (i) lack of capital, (ii)



ANNEX 3
Page 3
lack of credit facilities, for the purchase of better quality seeds, fertili-
zers and tractors, (iii) poor mechanization, and (iv) lack of extension
services.
6.        The relative importance of the social and private farms are illus-
trated by the following investment and production data.

7.        Cooperation between the private and social sector is viewed in
Yugoslavia as a means of improving productivity in both sectors. It takes
the form of provision of services by the social sector, such as supply of
fertilizers, harvesting, cultivation, marketing and credit and the contrac-
ting of joint production. Although the number of cooperative arrangements



ANNEX 3
Page 4
declined froim 1.3 million in 1964 to 0.9 million in 1970, farmers cooperating
with social farms showed consistently higher average yields than independent
private farmers during the same period. 1/
Agricultural Prospects and the "Green Plan"
8.        The social development plan for 1971-75 projects an annual growth
of aggregate agricultural production of 3.2 percent per year, with the social
sector growing at 5 percent and the private sector at 2.8 percent per year.
This target assumes a significant acceleration of growth in the private
sector. To this end the Yugoslav Government has recently enacted a "Green
Plan" to be carried out during 1973-85. The Plan stresses farm mechanization
and modern agricultural methods to improve output and productivity and allo-
cates for 1974 and 1975 annually Din 750 million (US$50 million) in financial
assistance to the private and social sector. Although the legislation passed
as to date states that the development target set by the "Green Plan" requires

B. THE MARKET FOR TRACTORS
Structure of the Industry
9.        Yugoslav tractor production increased steadily over the past
decade. However, the domestic production of tractors cannot accurately be
determined since the available statistical material does not distinguish
between tractors, motorcultivators and other agricultural machinery such as
mowers, crawler tractors, etc.
1/   Partly because small farmers in the underdeveloped mountainous regions
have no access to social sector agricultural organizations.

It has been estimated that the production of motorcultivators and miscella-
neous agricultural machinery increased from about 850 units in 1965 to 3,500
units in 1972.
10.       At present, IMT is the largest Yugoslav manufacturer of motor-
cultivators and tractors accounting for 85% of the domestic production capa-
city of tractors and for 55% of the domestic motorcultivator capacity. 1/
The company manufactures units of its own design relying to more than 95X
on Yugoslav-sources for raw materials and components supplies; the five other
producers are essentially assemblers of imported components. In view of the
growing trend for farm mechanization in Yugoslavia, several companies are
planning to expand their capacities or to enter the tractor assembly business.
A number of these investment plans are still under discussions, so thrt the
projected capacities presented below can give only a tentative idea of the
future structure of the industry.
1/   IYT added motorcultivators to its product line in 1970 by acquiring the
Motorcultivator and Agricultural Implements Factory, FMK Knjazevac.

74   Not yet finalized; the expansion of IMT Knjazevac has been completed,
IMT Belgrade and Ruen Kocani are under construction, whereas the ex-
pansions of the other companies are still in the planning phase.
From a capacity point of view INT can be expected to remain the dominant
producer of motorcultivators and tractors in the above 30 hp range. However,
four manufacturers of 18-25 hp tractors are planning to expand their total
production capacity to about 12,000 units/year which may result in consider-
able competition in this product range.



ANNEX 3
Page 7
11.       The above table distinguishes between motorcultivators, 18-25 hp
tractors and above 30 hp tractors; they constitute in the Yugoslav context
separate market and production categories. On the one hand, motorcultivators
(5-12 hp) serve a special market segment, because they are the only feasible
and economical 1/ means of mechanization for orchards, vineyards and small
holdings, but they require physical labor to operate. On the other hand,
the present and projected production of 18-25 hp units in Yugoslavia include
tractor as well as motorcultivator types: the Pasquali tractor (18.5 hp) can
be described as riding motorcultivator, whereas the Steyr and planned IMT 25
hp tractors are small, less costly and maneuverable versions of a standard
tractor.
Users of Tractors
12.       Tractors are primarily used for farming.  However, equipped with
special implements they have been employed for transport, construction and
semi-industrial work as well as in the forestry field. Light industrial
units - front end shovel loaders, rear mounted back hoes, etc. - are used
primarily in the construction industry. These units are developed from
standard agricultural tractors, the main changes usually being a heavier front
axle, heavier tires, a high capacity hydraulic pump mounted at the front of
the engine crankshaft, the agricultural 3 point hitch and hydraulic system
deleted and often a shuttle reverse added between the standard clutch and
transmission. No information on total usage of tractors for non-agricultural
purposes in Yugoslavia is available, but IMT sold during the 1969-1972 period
annually about 120 tractors for forest mechanization, 100 tractors to con-
struction companies and about 300 units for general transport and haulage
work.
Supply and Demand Pattern
Farm Mechanization in Yugoslavia
13.       The Yugoslav tractor fleet has increased three-fold from 42,730
1/   The 1972 average price of a 7 hp motorcultivator in Yugoslavia was Din
13,000 compared to Din 28,000 for a 18.5 hp tractor and Din 38,000 for
a 35 hp model.

Thereby, Yugoslavia reached a level of farm mechanization of 0.45 hp/ha which
compares with the level of mechanization of Romania and the USSR (Table 1,
page 9). In contrast, western European countries such as Italy and France
have reached 1.6 hp/ha and 3.2 hp/ha, respectively.
14.       The trend towards a higher level of farm mechanization in Yugoslavia
shows five distinct characteristics:
(i) the absolute and relative size of the tractor fleet varies
considerably among regions. As shown in Table 1, Croatia
and Slovenia have reached about 0.65 hp/ha whereas Montenegro
is at a low of 0.05 hp/ha;
(ii) mechanization in the social sector is far more advanced than
in private farming (0.86 hp/ha compared with 0.36 hp/ha);
(iii) the average size of a tractor used in Yugoslavia at present
is about 38 hp. However, the average size of tractors on
social farms in 1972 was 51 hp compared to 32 hp on private
holdings (Table 2, page 27);
(iv) the number of tractors on social farms decreased continuously
starting 1967, due to a switch to higher horsepower tractors;
and
(v) the notable increase of the Yugoslav tractor fleet since
1969 is due to accelerated mechanization of private holdings;
i.e., the number of tractors in the private sector increased
by about 30% annually. The main factors strengthening
private demand were the elimination of excise taxes on
tractors and fuel in 1970, the availability of cash through
workers' remittances and the considerable increase of farm
prices after 1969.

15.       Sales of tractors and other agricultural machinery between 1969
and 1972 have more than doubled. However, domestic production accounted for
a declining share of domestic sales (57% in 1972 as compared to 63% in 1967).
This indicates that the demand for tractors in Yugoslav, stimulated by the
drive towards farm mechanization, increased at a faster rate than the Yugoslav
tractor industry was able to expand its production capacity.

Imports
16.       To meet excess demand, Yugoslavia has increased its import of tract-
ors from about 5,460 units in 1970 to 12,76t) units in 1972. Import quotas
are determined annually by a specialized Government agency to balance domestic
demand and production. Nearly 65% of tractor imports during the past five
years came from clearing countries, mainly because of bilateral trade agree-
ments and the price competitiveness of East European tractors (para. 20).
However, the proliferation of imports to meet Yugoslavia's growing tractor
demand has created serious problems and diseconomies: Yugoslavia imported
between 1965 and 1972 41,000 tractors or 304 different models from 21 coun-
tries and 53 manufacturers. Even though a supply of spare parts and imple-
ments comes with the tractor, it is unlikely to meet the need during the
entire life of the tractor. In addition, the variety of types requires a
high level of maintenance and repair skills. Consequently, utilization and
useful life of imported tractors has been lower than of domestic units.
17.       In the Yugoslav context of trade regulations, tractor imports are
meant to supplement domestic production. After the planned local production
increase, imports can be expected to drop sharply, but may remain at a
minimum level to account for (i) arrangements with clearing countries, (ii)
direct import by workers returning to Yugoslavia and (iii) special models
which are not produced locally.
Exports
18.       Yugoslav enterprises have to export a minimum amount to earn the
foreign exchange necessary for their operations through the retention quota
system (Annex 2-7, para. 17). However, IMT accounts for nearly 98% of
Yugoslavia's past export of agricultural machinery. The other producers
export components or assembled parts under their license agreements.
19.       Table 4 illustrates  fiT's total tractor export by country.  The
heavy concentration of sales to India resulted from an agreement with TAFFE,
the Massey-Ferguson license holder in that country. Sales began as whole
tractors then gradually shifted to a partly knocked-down (PKD) and later to
a completely knocked-down (CKD) basis as TAFFE increased its production of
components. Sales to other countries represent complete tractors. IMT has
made new commitments for 500 tractors each to India and Uganda in 1973 and
won an IDA tender in Pakistan for 2,000 units. Due to the priority of
domestic needs, the Company has been unable to merchandize exports aggres-
sively.
Suppy-Demand Gap
20.       Despite the growing volume of imports in the face of increased
domestic production, there is still a considerable supply-demand gap for
tractors that has been estimated as high as 5,000 units annually. Indica-
tions for an existing excess demand are

(iii) the purchase of IMT bonds for DM 20 million repayable
in Dinars to secure preferential delivery of tractors.
Prices, Tariffs and Competition
21.       IMT's dominant position in the tractor market in Yugoslavia rela-
tive to other domestic and foreign producers underlines the competitiveness
of its product line.  This is mainly due to:
(i)  a good design and a product line well prove from the
standpoint of performance and reliability;
(ii)  a long history of successful and continually expanding
production;
(iii)  ready availability of spare parts and matching imple-
ments;
(iv)  a record of progressive product updatihg and improve-
ment and additions to the product lines so that the
current IMT line compares favorably in range of models
and design with most major manufacturers worldwide
(Annex 2-3);
(v)  Efficient production leading to low production costs with
resulting very competitive retail prices (Annex 6-2,
and para. 20);
(vi)  a nationwide sales and service network which has been
expanded and strengthened concurrently with expansion
of production (para. 51) of this Annex).
22.       The domestic prices for tractors are initially determined by the
manufacturing firm, but annual price increases have to be approved by the
Federal Council for Prices. Export prices can be set freely by the enter-
prises. Imports of tractors are controlled and the official customs duty
of 18% plus 9% import duty and 1% custom evidence give an additional price
protection of 29%. Prices of locally sold tractors compare as follows:

23.       IMT selling prices are about 6-15% below those for comparable
tractors from Eastern European countries and about 35-100% below prices
for Western European tractors. A notable exception are the Russian MTZ
tractors in the 70-80 hp range which are sold 10-15% cheaper than the
equivalent IMT tractor. 1/ However, Eastern European price quotations
1/   In the past, this has not impaired IMT's competitiveness since farmers
prefer locally produced tractors for ease of supply of spare parts and
repair facilities.

relate partly to barter agreements. Taking into account the 29% tariff
protection the Company still maintains its considerable domestic price
competitiveness vis-a-vis Western European countries. As to export prices
IMT has maintained its domestic selling price in foreign markets. In order
to allow for transport charges, the Yugoslav Government supports exports by
paying a transport subsidy of 21% to developing countries and Japan, 15% to
the USA and 7% to Western European countries.
24.       As to qualitative difference between IMT tractors and foreign units,
the IMT 30-60 hp models are (i) fully competitive with Western European and
US models from a design and performance point of view and (ii) have a clear
advantage in regard to the supply of matching implements and spare parts.
For tractors in the 70-90 hp range, the IMT models meet the quality standards
of Eastern European tractors, whereas Western European and US models offer
more convenience features and advanced design. IMT's present development
program is designed to overcome this shortcoming by introducing the newly
developed transmission case, pumping and hydraulic system before 1975, and
offering a wider choice of tractor accessories after project completion in
1976.
C.   PROJECTED TRACTOR DEMAND
Domestic Market for Tractors Used in Agriculture
25.       In developing a market forecast for tractors and farm machinery in
a country, the following factors must be considered: h(i) hp/hectare required
to provide an acceptable level of mechanization; (ii) size range (hp) of
tractors required to permit effective and economic tractor utilization accord-
ing to the size of farms and types of crops produced and degree of coopera-
tion, (iii) replacement (useful life) period: (iv) obsolescence factor: (v)
cash generating capacity of farms and/or availability of credits; (vi) alter-
native means of farm mechanization (motorcultivator); and (vii) historical
pattern of domestic sales and existing fleet.
26.       The last point has been described above; the other considerations
and assumptions for the market forecast are discussed in the following para-
graphs as they apply to Yugoslavia.
27.       Projected Level of Farm Mechanization.  The hp required to achieve
full mechanization in agriculture varies according to the predominant type
of farming - intensive or extensive - the main crops grown and the size of
farm operating units. In countries which might be considered at a medium
stage in agricultural development tractor power is on the average in the
order of 0.5 hp per hectare of cultivable land. Where agriculture is virtually
completely mechanized hp per ha. ranges from 1.0 in countries with large
farms up to 3 hp per ha. in countries where farms are mainly small but where
agricultural production is on a very intensive basis (Table 1). In line with
the above in Yugoslavia full agricultural mechanization would be achieved at
a level of approximately 1.0 hp per ha. on the large farms in the social
sector and approximately 2.0 hp per ha. on the small farms in the private
sector.



ANNEX 3
Page 14
28.       Size Range (hp).  In 1972 the average hp of tractors in the social
sector was 51.3 compared with 32.5 hp in the private sector (Table 2). In
the social sector there is a definite trend to tractors with considerably
higher hp since on the large farms and big fields in this sector tractors of
80-100 hp can be used very effectively, particularly for heavy tillage work.
There will always be a considerable requirement, however, for tractors in the
40-60 hp class for general haulage, seeding and planting and general chores
work. The projections assume an increase of tractor sizes on social farms
to an average of 60 hp. In the private sector, it has been assumed that the
average tractor size will reach 38 hp by 1980, and average 40 hp per ha there-
after. The main reasons for this are (i) a worldwide trend to higher hp units
in agriculture, (ii) the use and an increasing availability of second-hand
tractors for small holdings which otherwise would use motorcultivators or
18-25 hp tractors, and (iii) the possible spread of cooperative ownership
or custom line work by private farmers with standard 40-50 hp tractors. 1/
29.       Replacement of tractors or their useful life varies with the in-
tensity of agriculture and the available maintenance and repair services.
In countries whose agriculture is considered to be completely mechanized
the total tractor market is equivalent to the replacement market as shown
below:

1/   A tractor is generally considered an economically sound investment, if
employed in productive work for a minimum of 1,000 hours per year, which
is about equivalent to the work of a 40 hp tractor on 40 ha. land.  In
Yugoslavia a private farmer and owner of a 40 hp tractor with only 10
ha. of land would need to work that tractor on neighboring farms either
on a hire or cooperative basis for 75% of the hours of use each year.
At present, cooperative machine work on approximately 12% of the cul-
tivated area in the private sector. The trend in most countries is for
a decrease in cooperative use of machinery, but to a significant in-
crease in custom hire use; however, Yugoslavia levies excise taxes on
tractors and fuel when used for custom hire work on farms making the
latter a less economical proposition.



ANNEX 3
Page 15
30.       In countries where agriculture is on an extensive basis, as in the
US and Canada, the replacement market is low in relation to the existing
tractor parc whereas in Europe, where farming is much more intensive, replace-
ment is higher. In all areas the rate of replacement is dropping, because of
the better quality and thus longer life expectancy of tractors produced in
recent years, and also because of the increasingly better maintenance and
repair services. Taking into account the level of mechanical skill in
Yugoslavia, the useful life of a tractor can be expected to vary between
10 years and 18 years. For the market projections it has been assumed that
replacement amounts to 8% of tractor sales (12.5 years) until 1980 and 6%
(16.6 years thereafter.
31.       Obsolescence rather than wear-out is a major factor in tractor
demand. Obsolescence also becomes of increasing importance as the level of
mechanization in the market area increases. Most tractors are traded in
not because they are worn out but because new models with improved perform-
ance, durability and particularly convenience features have come on the
market.  The average farmer also invariably trades for a slightly higher hp
unit. This is an important consideration for a manufacturer even if he does
not have any significant competition. Unless tractors are continually and
progressively updated the market will never reach the volume that it other-
wise would.
Motorcultivators
32.       To mechanize the private sector (8.6 million ha. cultivable land)
to a level of 2.0 hp/ha., about 17.3 million hp are required. It has been
assumed that about 10% of the power requirements 1/ of private farms will be
in the form of motorcultivators (5-12 hp), because of the large number of
holdings below 3 ha (1.9 million ha), vineyards and orchards (about 464,000
ha) in Yugoslavia. In view of the capacity expansions of motor cultivators
(para. 10) Yugoslavia can be expected to have a motorcultivator parc of
200,000 units averaging 9 hp by 1993 which is equivalent to a farm mechaniza-
tion level of 2 hp/ha for this market segment.
Availability of Cash and Credit
33.       In the social as well as private sector the availability of cash
or credit does not restrict total tractor demand in Yugoslavia at the present.
Social farms receive tractor loans for 3 year, at 12% interest p.a. and with
a 50% downpavment through the Agricultural Development Bank (Poliobanka) and
regional credit institutions. However, the majority of private farmers have
been making cash purchases. The private farmers, are able to do this, be-
cause they supplement their farm income shown below, by off farm labor, sales
1/   At present, about 15% of hp units in the private sector are motorcultiva-
tors. This percentage is expected to decrease with the overall trend to
hp tractors and the introduction of small, maneuverable tractors compet-
ing with motorcultivators.

34.       To continue the rapid growth of farm mechanization, the less
affluent farmers will have to be reached, which will in the future require
credit facilities. From 1976 onward, almost 100% of tractor sales to social
farms and 50% to private farmers may require financing of at least
50% of the sales price. This would result in annual credit requirements ot
Din 400 million for the private sector and Din 65 million for the social
sector. 2/ IMT as well as the Yugoslav Government are aware of the need for
agricultural credit in the near future. To this end, (i) IMT will make avail-
able from its projected cash supplies Din 75 million p.a. in credit for the
1976-78 period and Din 150 million thereafter, (ii) IMT intends to borrow
from the Belgrade Bank up to Din 80-100 million for onlending to its
dealers and customers, if the market situation so requires, and (iii) the
"Green Plan" (para. 8) with its emphasis on farm mechanization will
provide for such additional funds as may be required. However, the likely
bottleneck will be the total amount of credit available, as well as the
adequate channeling of credits to private farmers. Whereas the credit
system for social farms is well established, private farmers, have in
the past, 3/ received loans only indirectly through cooperation with social
1/   In 1969 there was a total of 2.5 million work animals on farms in the
private sector (Table 3). In the last four years approximately 200,000
have been replaced by tractor power, leaving about one animal for each
3.75 ha of cultivable land. The proceeds from the sale of an animal has
been sufficient to make the down payment on a tractor. It must be noted
that the produce from approximately 25% of the land that an animal works
is required to feed throughout the year. The replacement of work ani-
mals by tractor power thus significantly increases the marketable produc-
tion of the farm.
2/   Assuming an average tractor price of Din 50,000 and annual sales of 32,000
units in the private'sector, and Din 65,000 and 2,000 units in the social
sector.

sector organizations. Special attention should be given in setting up a
nation-wide administrative system which would make available on a continuous
basis loans for purchases of agricultural machinery.
Demand Projections
35.       The projected tractor parc and replacement needs for the private
and social sector are presented in Table 5. They indicate a total domestic
market for tractors in agriculture of 34,000 units per year during the next
20 years. In particular:
(a) for the private sector, assuming (i) a 12.5 year replacement cycle
until 1981 and 16 years thereafter, (ii) an increase of average
hp per tractor from 32.5 hp to 38 hp until 1983 and 40 hp there-
after, and (ii) a farm mechanization level of 1 hp/ha by 1980
and 2.0 hp/ha in 1993, about 32,000 tractors will be needed
annually during the concerned period.
(b) for the social sector, assuming (i) a 12.5 year replacement cycle
until 1981 and 16 years thereafter, (ii) an increase of average
hp per tractor from 51.8 hp to 60 hp, and (iii) 1 hp/ha by 1980
to meet the planned production increases, annual tractor sales of
2,000 units will be needed until 1981; thereafter, the replacement
market requires an addition of 1,500 units per year.
The annual demand by size category can be forecast as follows:

Export Market Projections
36.       IMT apnears to be the only tractor manufacturer which currently
or in the foreseeable future is capable of exporting agricultural machinery
to a notable extent (para. 10). The export market includes exports of (i)
tractors, (ii) CKD or PKD tractor sets, and (iii) components and spares.
Past exports (Table 4 and para. 17) give limited indication for the future,
since IMT restricted exports to meet local demand. Regarding the export of
assembled tractors, IMT is in a competitive position price- and product-wise
(para. 19-21) on markets in Western Eurone and the developing countries.
Sufficient credits will be made available by Yugoslav banks to facilitate
export sales. However, to maintain a sizeable market share in any foreign
country IMT is aware that it would have to establish permanent sales and
services organizations or cooperative agreements with other manufacturers and
dealers.
37.       The major and continually increasing export market to developing
countries is for caD and PKD tractor sets, rather than completely assembled
tractors. Usually the developing country grants a manufacturing license to
a limited number of foreign manufacturers on the basis that the manufacturers
will progressively increase the percentage of locally produced parts so that
within a 10 year period the tractor will have at least 50% local content.
In turn the developing country by imposing high import duties on imported
tractors gives their local licensees a virtual monopoly on the market. IMT's
successful long-run exports to TAFFE, India, was such an arrangement and the
Company has shown increasing expertise in providing a training program as part
of exports to developing countries. The level of exports of tractor sets
which IMT can expect depends on how thoroughly it develons such manufacturing
agreements during the coming 2-5 years.
38.       Regarding the export of components, IMT has a good potential in
supplying parts and components to Massey Ferguson for use in its assembly
plants worldwide, if design and quality control can be maintained to
Massey Ferguson standards.
39.       IMT's product line has considerable market potential.  The future
export market can be expected to range between 3,000 and 8,000 units annually
depending on IMT's marketing strategy and effort for the different export
market segments. This study assumes IMT's export market at 4,000 tractors
or tractor equivalents per year, since during the coming 3-5 years the
Company's staff will concentrate primarily on domestic expansion instead of
initiating a massive export promotion program.
Demand Projections for Non-agricultural Uses
40.       Tn Western Europe and North America the market for light industrial
units is approximately 10% of the agricultural tractor market. A 10% market
share can be considered conservative in the Yugoslav context: Tractors are
widely used for haulage and transportation of material, since the available



ANNEX 3
Page 19
quantities of specialized equipment is not sufficient to allow to substitute
tractors with specialized equipment to the same degree as in the developing
countries. In addition, IMT has developed close cooperation with the Federal
Center for Forest Mechanization in Yugoslavia and forecasts an annual tractor
demand of 150 units in this field. In view of these market segments in
Yugoslavia, an annual demand of at least 3,500 tractors for non-agriculturalf
uses has been projected.
Total Tractor Market and INT Prospects
41.       The following table summarizes the total projected tractor market
per year and TIT's production program after expansion.

Tractors in the 31-50 hp range are forecast to continue to be the dominant
sector of the market (67%') and of IMT's production program (71%). After
1983 it is likely that a considerable part of sales in this hp range will
shift to units in the 51-60 hp category at the expense of tractors in the
31-40 hp range.
42.       The above market fore-ast results in the following supply/demand
comparison:

72   Not including 7,500 units of riding cultivators which do also complete
with the 18-30 hp. tractors.
It has been assumed that import will continue to supplement domestic produc-
tion to meet local demand and about 150 tractors in the above 65 hp range,
will be imported to account for special equipment which are not locally
produced.
43.       To sell its projected tractor production IMT would have to esta-
blish an overall market share of 84% which is in line with the Company's
present market position among domestic producers. However, a comparison
of the market forecasts with the projected capacity expansion of all
Yugoslav tractor manufacturers indicates two possible problem areas:
(i) In the 18-30 hp category, total tractor forecast of 4,150
units per year compares with a likely domestic capacity of
about 12,000 units. Although this figure includes the
Pasquali riding motorcultivator (para. 11), which may
supply also to a certain extent the motorcultivator
market, there will be considerable competition in this
product category for the new IMT tractor.
(ii)  In the above 70 hp category, projected tractor demand of 2,550
units compares with IMT's production program of 3,600 units.
This discrepancy results from the underlying assumption that
the social sector will reach full farm mechanization at 1 hp/ha
and average 60 hp per tractors. The actual demand could be higher,
if the social sector requires a higher hp/ha level for adequate
mechanization and/or the trend to even higher average hp units



ANNEX 3
Page -21
accelerates. IMT can expect minimal domestic competition in
this product category, but some import competition from Eastern
European countries. The Company should monitor closely this
market segment in order to adjust the production program to the
actual demand.
44.       IMT is aware of the increasing domestic competition and possible
market constraints in the 18-30 hp and above 70 hp categories. Although the
projected profit margin for these tractor types are below those of the
standard models (Annex 6-2), the Company plans to enter the 18-25 hp and
above 100 hp market in order to strengthen its market position by offering
the full range of tractor products. It will be important for the Company to
follow up closely on production cost and market success of the new models in
order to incorporate changes or delete these product types if they prove
uneconomical.
D.   TIIE MARKET FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS
45.       An acceptable level of tractor utilization can be achieved only if
4mplements are available in the numbers, types and sizes required to match
sales of tractors in the various hp categories and for the different types
of soil, climate and cropping conditions prevailing in the country. It is
important therefore that any expansion in tractor production be accompanied
by a similar level of expansion in implement production. This is of parti-
cular importance in an expanding market, where tractors are replacing work
animals since animal-drawn implements cannot be adapted for use with tractors.
When the tractor market reaches a static level and is basically a replacement
market, however, the market for implements usually decreases significantly
since (i) their useful life is longer than that of tractors, and (ii) the
obsolescence factor is not as important.
Structure of the Industry
46.       From the standpoint of engineering development and production
implement manufacturing presents an entirely different situation than the
tractor business. A tractor is a sophisticated machine with a very high ratio
of cost-to-weight, and where all design specifications and production tole-
rances are measured in thousandths of an inch or the metric equivalent. Imple-
ments on the other hand have a low cost-to-weight ratio and design specifi-
cations and production tolerances are measured only in fractions of an inch.
Tractor production consists mainly of precision machinery, while implement
manufacturing is welding and the assembly of welded sections to rough castings
and/or forgings. A good tractor engineer is therefore usually not successful
in designing low cost, functional implements. Also in production, there is
only a limited opportunity for the transfer of labor between, or the utili-
zation of, the same facilities for tractor and implement production. Compared
to tractor production, implement manufacture is characterized by higher need
for diversity, greater ease of innovations and greater ease of entry into
production. The latter is illustrated by the fact that there are about 20



ANNEX 3
Page 22
manufacturers of agricultural implements in Yugoslavia, but only 3-4 producers
of tractors.  However, the possibility of entering the implements market
varies according to the type of implement.  The production of the rather
sophisticated implements - plows, disc harrows, seed drills and crop plan-
ters requires expertise in design and relatively high toolage costs which
cannot normally be provided by small manufacturers.
Demand and Supply Pattern
47.       Agricultural implements have been in short supply in Yugoslavia,
particularly for the imported tractors. According to the present relatively
low level of mechanization and use of modern farming techniques in Yugoslavia,
demand and supply in the private sector has been concentrated on basic imple-
ments such as trailers and plows. However, social farms require a broad range
of implements and types which match the larger hp units.
48.       There are no continuous statistics on implements production and
sales in Yugoslavia. 1/ The following table sdmmarizes the available infor-
mation:

According to Yugoslav experts the supply of implements for IMT tractors has
been adequate because of cooperative agreements with other implement manufac-
turers, and IMT's recent expansion of its implements line. (Annex 2-3, Para.
12).
1/  According to the Statistical Buletin, implements production in Yugoslavia
increased from 15,100 tons to 22,302 tons, but such information provides
limited insight since weight and sales mix of farm implements vary widely.

Market Projections
49.       Future demand for implements must be analyzed on a sectorial basis.
In the social sector the average of tractors is moving from approximately 50
hp to 60 hp. However, tractors of more than 60 hp cannot effectively utilize
the small 3-point hitch mounted implements used on smaller tractors which
they replaced. Tractors in the over 60 HP class require large size semi-
mounted or pull type implements of proportionately greater weight and strength
per hp of power requirement. In the private sector where tractors in the
under 50 hp range will continue to predominate, tractor 3-point hitch mounted
implements will be the type required; and this market segment can be expected
to absorb used implements from the social farms. Stated on the basis of a
percentage of tractor sales, therefore, the market for implements relative
to tractors should not be as great in the private as in the social sector.
50.       The table below indicates the average annual sales of implements
which can be anticipated in the period 1976-1983. This is based on average
annual sales of tractors in that period of approximately 32,000 to the pri-
vate sector and 2,000 to the social sector. Sales can be expected to peak and
maintain high voiumes in the period 1978-1983 but fall off by 20-50% after
1983 when the implements market becomes basically one of replacement.

51.       IMT expects to sell about 60% of the projected implement require-
ment, of which 70% would be produced by IMT, Belgrade, after project complet-
ion, and the balance subcontracted to its affiliated producers.

IMT's production projections can be considered realistic in view of the
structure of the implements industry.  An adequate supply of IMT tractors
with implements can be assumed if IMT assures the supply of 50% of required
trailers or cultivators and 75% of the more sophisticated implements as disc
harrows, plow and seed drills. Since the above production volume will be
assembled in two shifts after completion of Phase I, and in one shift after
the Phase II expansion, IMT could increase its own implements production if
the market so requires. The Company intends to monitor the development of
the implements market closely in order to adjust the product volume and
design if necessary.
E.   IMT's MARKETING AND SERVICE ORGANIZATION
52.       IMT's marketing operations are directed by the Sales and Services
Department which includes separate divisions for export, domestic sales,
inventory and distribution, and service and spare parts. The department is
assisted by the marketing research and advertising group of the UMI staff.
Sales Organization
53.       Over the past 15 years IMT has established a wide ranging dealer
network in Yugoslavia for the distribution of tractors, agricultural imple-
ments and spare parts. This consists of (i) 26 dealers (Map: IBRD 1050 3R)
relating directly to IMT, and (ii) 100 sub-agents who work with IMT only
through its respective dealer. The number of sub-agents per dealer varies
from 2 to 12 depending on the size and agricultural importance of the
area. IMT does not own any sales facilities in Yugoslavia or abroad.
54.       The sales organizations are not exclusive dealers for IMT products,
but distribute about 90% of agricultural machinery available for the
Yugoslav market, i.e., about 30,000 tractors in 1972 and a proportional
number of implements and spare parts. Accordingly, the dealer network has
been handling nearly twice IMT's sales volume and can be expected to channel
without notable adjustment problems 35,000-45,000 tractors per year after
the completion of the IMT expansion.



ANNEX 3
Page 25
55.       The present dealer network fulfills only distribution functions
instead of sales and promotion tasks due to the demand-supply gap for tractors
during the past year. The Company is aware of this situation and realizes
the need for more intensive marketing activities by its agents after the
expansion. To this end IMT will:
(i) make available to its dealers and customers medium-term credits
in the range of Din 75-150 million per year;
(ii) initiate a training program for dealers and customers. The
training program foresees 2-4 week courses for about 100 dealers
per year and the IMT sales personnel at the IMT service school
in Belgrade. In addition, informatory courses and instruction
for potential customers and technical personnel will be organized
by IMT and its dealers at regular intervals; and
(iii)  establish exclusive dealerships during the 1978-1980 period.
It can be expected that the Yugoslav market for agricultural
machinery will become a buyers' market in the 1980s, so that IMT
intends to have selected and trained, by that time, exclusive
dealers who can adequately promote IMT's products.
Services and Repair Organization
56.       IMT-Belgrade directs the activities of the Yugoslav service and
repair facilities and acts as servicing agents for Massey-Ferguson tractors
in Yugoslavia. The service and repair organization consists of:
(a) the Repair Center in Dobanovci, which is part of IMT (Annex 2-4,
para. 19). It provides at present industrial overhaul of about
1,500 tractors per year. With increasing supply of new tractors
the overhaul function is expected to decrease and Dobanovei will
be equipped to handle the increasing service requirements and
sales of spare parts for the IMT tractor fleet in its area;
(b) 146 service workshops which are classified according to equipment
and work program in 45 Type I workshops, 64 Type II workshops,
and 37 Type III workshops. All workshops are independent
entities which have signed service contracts with one of IMT's
26 dealers. The distribution, size and number of workshops have
been continuously increased according to the increase of IMT's
tractor fleet.
57.       The dealer allocates the service and repair of IMT products to
the workshops in his district, supplies spare parts, and settles warranting
claims and on-the-spot emergency repairs; whereby, Type I workshops also
perform general overhaul functions and render services to Type El and Type
III workshops - if more sophisticated personnel and equipment is required.



ANNEX 3
Page 26
58.       The repairs and servicing system has worked satisfactorily in the
past. To prepare for the increasing servicing requirements after project
completion IMT intends (i) to strengthen the-existing workshops through
training of its maintenance personnel, and (ii) encourage its dealers to
sub-contract new workshops if needed. The traiaing program is expected to
start in 1975 and will involve (i) 2-6 week courses for about 100 instructors
of regional training centers, and for about 100 agricultural engineers of
socially owned farms, at the EMT se-rvice school in Belgrade; and (ii) 1-4
week couirses for about 3,000 repair and maintenance people per year in 50
regional training centers.

Y'JGOSLAVIA - IMT TRACTOR EXPANSION PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
1.        The project is to increase the capacity of IMT's Belgrade factory
to an annual production volume by 1976 of 35,000 tractors, 27,000 implements
and a proportionate number of accessories and spare parts. The new facilities
will allow, in addition to the present IMT product range, the manufacture of
about 3,000 20-25 hp tractors/year and 400 above-100 hp tractors/ year.
A.   IMT Expansion Program
2.        IMT's overall progran for the Belgrade factory foresees an expansion
in two stages. It will increase the plant facilities as follows:

Expansion Phase I ("The Project")
3.        The first expansion phase (or the project) is designed to enable the
Company to meet the production targets stated in para. 1. The main factors
characterizing the IMT project are the following:
(a)  Construction of a new tractor parts machine shop (21,600 m2)
with additional 5,400 m2 of auxiliary floor area. Heat
treatment and surface protection facilities will be installed,
as well as 690 machine tools (265 existing and 425 new) which
will be arranged in 50 production lines. The existing 265
machines including the tools store will be shifted to the new
building. However, some tractor parts, particularly welded
components, will be produced in the implements shop.
(b)  Construction of a tractor assembly plant (16,200 mi2) with
additional 4,050 22 auxiliary floor area. The existing
usable machines will be shifted to the new building and
supplemented by new transfer lines, conveyors and paint
shops.
(c)  Construction of a front and side annex (5,145 m2), with connection to
the existing production bay, which will include offices for
the Production Planning and Quality Control Departments,
a cafeteria, locker-rooms, etc.
(d) Reorganization and rehabilitation of the existing tractor
production and assembly plant into a main implement production
and assembly area. The existing heat treatment facilities
will remain and be used exclusively for implements. The
existing maintenance and tools shop will also remain and more
machine tools will be added. The new layout will improve work
conditions and health standards to the acceptable level. The
present implements shed, which had been built on the property
of FOB, will be dismantled.
(e)  Construction of three Dutch barns (3,800 m2), an
oxygen bottle shed (40 m2), underground fuel and lubrica-
tion store (500 m2) and raw material stores (7,695 m2) with
appropriate storage equipment facilities.
(f) Building of access roads within the factory area.
(g) Installation of electronic data processing equipment
for production planning, inventory control and
accounting.
(h) Installation of additional laboratory equipment (test
rig equipment, microfilm equipment, vibration exciter, etc.).



ANNEX 4-1

(i) Compressor station (350 im2) and annex to the old
production hall (2,000 m2).
4.        The plant layout (Annex 4-2, page 1) illustrates the proposed
expansion. Production on a one-shift basis in the tractor assembly plant
and two shifts in all other production facilities will permit the manufac-
ture of 35,000 tractors, 27,000 implements, various attachments and spare
parts.
The proposed project includes a high degree of flexibility in
product range. By producing in 3 shifts IMT could increase its tractor output
to 50,000-70,000 units/year. On the other hand, by changing the product
mix and manufacturing more implements, accessories and spare parts than
presently proposed, the Company could economically decrease the tractor
production to 20-25,000 units.
Expansion Phase II
5.        Preliminary planning for Phase II has been completed in the framework
of the overall expansion program. Phase II will primarily consist of the
construction of new buildings to improve the working conditions of the
administrative and service departments:
Expansion of Facilities (Phase II)
in2
1.   Tools & maintenance shop                        6,500
2.   Development Department                          3,800
3.   Spare Parts Department                          3,600
4.   Expansion of the Scaffolding Production Shop  4,175
5.   Stores for paint equipment, fire resistant
material, fuel, salts, chemicals, scrap       4,000
6.   Garage & fire station                           2,000
7.   Sales pavillion                                 3,000
8.   Head office                                     5,000
9.   Kindergarten & medical center                   2,700
10.   Central kitchen                                 1,000
Since these facilities are not mandatory for reaching the planned
capacity, IMT has not finally decided on the exact period of Phase II project
execution. The implementation schedule will primarily depend on the avail-
ability of funds.  Phase II expansion is estimated to cost about Din 200
million, of which about 10% would be in foreign exchange. IMT's projected
financial situation (Annex 7-2) should allow the Company to undertake
Phase II in 1978-79. For the purpose of this report the project refers solely
to the Phase I expansion. The proposed Bank loan will be used for Phase I,
whereas IMT's cash generation after full expansion to 35,000 tractor/year
in 1976 should be sufficient to finance the Phase II expansion.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 4
B.   Tractor Parts Machine Plant
6.        The layout of the new tractor parts machine plant is given in
Annex 4-2, page 1. The bay includes the machine shop with 40 lines, repair,
heat treatment and surface protection facilities. Certain tractor parts
(hydraulic pump and front axles, welded, pressed and rough machined parts)
will not be manufactured in the new plant, but in the implement shop and
its Annex. The improved features of the proposed tractor parts machine
plant are a) its short production cycle, b) its completion of each part on
one machine line only, c) good production process planning and rational
grouping of machines. The plant will work on a two-shift basis, although
its capacity could be expanded by going over to three shift operation.
7.        The machine shop manufactures gears, differentials, gear assemblies
and miscellaneous tractor parts on 40 machine lines. The five major machine
groupings are castings, steel parts, gears, high volume small parts, and
grinding. Internally, medium weight parts are transported by roller conveyor,
whereas light parts rely on overhead monorails. Heavy parts which do not
require heat treatment are conveyed directly to the assembly shop. To
facilitate the production flow, parts requiring heat treatment are produced
near the heat treatment shop, and conveyed directly to the heat treatment,
plating or grinding operations.
8.        MIachine Tool Requirements.  DIT estimates that out of 333 existing
machine tools, 265 could be effectively used in the expansion program. The
present manufacture of 12,000 tractors is effected on 333 machine tools of
which 65 are of high productivity (18.3%). After expansion (35,000 tractors/
year), a total of 690 machine tools will be used out of which 245 will be
highly productive (34.0%). The project includes 275 standard machine tools
and the following additions of high productivity machine tools: 4 multi
spindle bar automatics, 25 automatic and semi-automatic machine tools, 42
front operated lathes, 10 drilling machines with rotary tables, 23 multi spindle
drilling machines, 3 deep hole drilling and boring machines, 3 automatic grind-
ing machines with charger, 5 profile grinding machines, 2 heavy duty surface
grinding machines, 2 centerless profile grinding machines, 1 external broach-
ing machine, 24 single spindle bar-automnatices, 2 internal gear hobbing ma-
chines.
9.        Machine Tool Utilization.  From the production point of view, this
selection of machine tools will facilitate a significant reduction of machine
time. Tne machine time on an IMT 533 tractor with differential lock and cab
will be reduced from 121.0 hours to 85.5 hours, thus saving 35.5 hours (29%).
However, a transfer machine 1/ is used only for rear axle trumpet housing.
No other components are mw. .ilned on transfers.  The trumpet housing transfer
1/ A transfer machine is a complex, automated machine capable of doing
different operations including setting up of the machine and inspection.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 5
machine reduces the present 10 machines, 7 workers and 8 minutes stroke and
52 minutes full cycle time to one transfer machine with two workers/shift
and 2.6 minutes stroke and 5.2 minutes full cycle time.
10.       The machine tool utilization for both shifts is satisfactory (92%).
In order to prevent transfer of a component from one line to another, a num-
ber of auxiliary and cheap machines are installed in the line, although the
percentage utilization of such a machine may be low. Similarly, on lines re-
quiring close tolerance gear cutting, the grinding machines are added on the
same line. For spiral gears requiring high tolerance which cannot be obtained
by copy lathe, an additional grinding machine is added on the line.
11.       Heat Treatment in the tractor parts machine plant a second heat
treatment unit will be installed. A transfer of the existing facilities
would be too costly and, moreover, they can be used economically in the old
building for implement parts treatment. The operation involves, consecutively,
gas carburation, hardening heating, quenching in pools with water, oil thermal
solutions, and under pressure machines, inductive hardening, ignition harden-
ing, soft nitriding, annealing, normalizing, degreasing, washing and sand
blasting. The proposed production program requires the following capacities:
tons/year
Gas carburation                         4,100
quenching                                7,150
soft initriding                           150
ignition and inductive hardening        1,850
pressure hardening machines             1,250
sand blasting                           5,730
The installation of the new equipment will fundamentally change the
technological level of IMT's heat treatment operation: a) the heating of the
gas carburation furnace will be by propane-butane gas which results in higher
productivity; b) hardening by ignition or intermediate frequency currents
achieves a higher productivity than classical heating; and c) the installa-
tions can be arranged near the machine line, thus improving material flow and
production time.
12.       Surface Protection of tractor parts and implements will be carried
out partly in the existing bay and partly in the new tractor parts machine
plant. The process consists of four basic operations (galvanizing, plating-
copper, nickel or chrome, phosphate treatment and burnishing), and the corres-
ponding final operations (degreasing, pickling, rinsing, drying, oil coating,
anodizing, mounting, demounting, partial isolation of surfaces, copper de-
plating, and uncoating of foiled galvanic films).



ANNEX 4-1
Page 6
The Droject requires an annual capacity for surface protection of:
galvanizing               6,813,000 pcs        or         2,900 dm2
copperplating                  5,700 pcs        or       12,740 dm2
decorative chromeplating   304,000 pcs          or      129,000 di
phosphate treatment       3,806,000 pcs        or         3,646 kg
Tne surface protection equipment in the new plant will include gal-
vanizing and phosphate treatment facilities only. The galvanizing process is
similar to the existing one. Automatic equipment has not been selected since
the size of the treated parts varies widely which would impede continuous
operation.
A special disposal installation will neutralize the waste liquid
resulting from the surface protection and hardening operations.
C.   Tractor Assembly Plant
13.       The layout of the tractor assembly plant is given in Annex 4-2,
page 2. The new 16200 m2 bay will provide areas for the main assembly and
sub-assembly lines, two paint and drying shops, tractor accessories assembly,
final tractor inspection and adjustment, engine storage, transit storage and
storage of parts from outside suppliers. The layout of the assembly shop is
spacious with 2 horizontal and 3 longitudinal passages each of which is 5
meters wide, and a number of service passages along the work area. The
layout of the plant is sound. It provides good working conditions and suf-
ficient floor space for Later modification.
14.       The new assembly shop consists of eight major assembly group lines
(center housin-, gear box assembly, engine preparation, front axle prepara-
tion, main assembly, parts painting, sheet metal painting, final assembly)
and a number of sub-assembly work areas.  The assembly operations are designed
to be carried out as selected group activities, i.e., based on time and
motion study, norms for each operation in assembly have been established,
and the work so designed that each worker is engaged equally with no idle
manpower capaciry. Required hardware is stored in boxes or special carriages
on wheels along the assembly line which increases the productivity of the
assembly operation considerably. Internal transportation is by conveyors,
synchronized through a central control system.
15.       The improved material flow and machine grouping of the new tractor
assembly shop will permit assembly of the model IMT 533/540 at 2.6 min/stroke 1/
and the model IMT 558/560 at 3.7 min/stroke as compared to 7.0 min/stroke
and 8.9 min/stroke for the present operation.
1/   Output frequency, i.e., 2.6 min/stroke means that every 2.6 minutes a
tractor rolls out of the assembly shop.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 7
Quality Control
16.       The proposed project will overcome the deficiencies of the present
quality control system. The improved material flow and machine organization
of assembly and sub-assembly lines will allow for the introduction of a line
inspection system on all assembly operations,
17.       Painting Shops the tractor assembly plant includes two painting and
drvino qhrnc for sheet metal and parts. The new paintshops will be heated
by oil instead of the electric powered infra-red rays of the present facilities.
This technologically more advanced solution is cheaper, safer and results in
a higher drying productivity. About 82 items will be processed through the
sheet metal paintshop, where the following operations are carried out: (a)
washing, (b) painting, (c) vaporizing, (d) drying and cooling. The parts are
painted red, grey and blue-green.
D.   Implements Production Shop.
18.       The project envisages the transfer of the existing implements pro-
duction shop to the existing main production bay. The implements heat treat-
ments and assembly operation will occupy about 1/3 of the building which will
also accommodate offices, the repair shop, the tool room, and the raw material
and parts storage.
19.       The implement production shop producing about 27,000 units/year in
two shifts, will require 127 new machines and reorganization of the four major
assembly lines in a) a trailer line with a floor conveyor, mechanized painting
booth and oven (80°C); b) a plow line with an overhead conveyor, painting
booth and oven (140-180°C); c) a cultivator line with a floor conveyor, paint-
ing booth and oven (140-180'C); and d) a common line for small machines.
In addition, a fifth ground painting booth will be installed.
E.   Storage and Material Handling Facilities
20.       Internal Transport has been primarily by forklifts.  The expansion
project aims to reorganize the production flow and will introduce conveyors
as far as possible. In particular, conveyors will be used for transport of
a) sheet metal through the paint shop and assembly line, b) parts within the
machine shop, c) prepared engines to the assembly line.  Transport of heavy
parts will be carried out in pallets by forklifts. However, the Company has
not yet determined the internal transport system in sufficient detail. Assu"-
once should be sought during negotiation that adequate steps have been taken.
21.       Storage.  The proposed covered and open store areas are adequate
and take into account the supply of raw material and parts from outside sour-
ces, IMT's production of semi-finished and finished components as well as the



ANNEX 4-1
Page 8
internal and external material movement2system. The project includes the
following storage facilities a) 7,695 m raw material storage and preparation
bay, b) a storage area in the existing production hall primarily for forgings,
castings and components, c) an engine and finished components store, in the
tractor assembly bay, d) 3 sheltered stores of 3,800 m2 each for tires and
engines, e) an underground flame-proofed fuel and lubricants store, f) an
open storage area for tractors and implements, and g) an oxygen bottle shed.
F. Utilities
22.       Electricity.  The existing transformer sub-station (35/10 KV), which
is also used by FOB, will not have sufficient capacity to meet both companies
increased needs after project completion. Therefore, an agreement was reached
with BEOGRADSKE ELEKTRANE, the local power company, for the supply of addi-
tional electricity as well as installation of a main transformer station along
with transmission lines. A new 110/10 KV transformer to be built in the IMT
complex will be connected through a 3 km double circuit 110 KV overhead trans-
mission lines will be shared by IMT and FOB according to their projected
power needs; 50%, of the transformer investment cost will be provided by
BEOGRADSKA ELEKTRANE and 25% each by IfT and FOB.
Total annual consumption of electric energy is expected to increase
from 12 MW to 31.5 MW after project completion.  On a per unit basis, this
implies an average electricity consumption increase per tractor from 600 kwh
to 700 kwh due to improved ventilation, heating and lighting in the plants,
a higher degree of mechanization of machining and internal transport as well
as additional in-house tractor parts production.
23.       Water.  IMT is connected with3the Belgrade water supply system and
uses at present an average of 550,000 m water/year. The existing wells on
the property have not been exploited during the past ten years.  The project
envisages the construction of a) a water recirculation system, primarily for
cooling water used in the compressor station and the hardening process, and
b) extension of the existing water neutralizing facilities. The recircula-
tion of water is expected to result in a decrease of annual water consumption
to about 390,000 m3. Water supply does not pose any problem.
24.       Compressed air is supplied by FOB which3has sufficient capacity to
supply IT7 s present 3average consumption of 6.2 m /minute.  After expansion
a capacity of 49.8 m /min. will be necessary. As part of the project flT
plans to install its own compressor station (capacity: 3,000 m ) in one of
the existing buildings.
25.       Cas.  Th1e heat treatment ovens as well as the paint booth in the
existing production hall use liquid propane gas, whereas the drying process
after painting relies on electric power. The installation of additional sur-
face protection, heat treatment facilities and paint shops will more than



ANNEX 4-1
Page 9
triple IMT's annual gas consumption. After expansion, IMT intends to pXrchase
natural gas for heating of the automatic heat treatment ovens (142.5 Nm /h)
and the drying installations (199.5 Nm3/h). NAFTAGAS has been informed of
the Company's natural gas requirements of 351 Nm3/h.
26.       Heating.  The existing production facilities on IMT's property are
heated partly by FOB's steam boiler and partly by 130C water from the Central
Heating Station in Belgrade. The covered area of 30,670 m2 with a capacity
of 152,520 m3 requires about 5,000 x 16 KCal heating energy per year.
The Central Heating Station Belgrade agreed to supply DMT's total
projected heating requirements of about 25.106 KCal/h. after21975.  This hot
water supply will be sufficient for heating of the 123,205 m covered area
(823,040 m3) and servicing of the ventilation system io Lhe tractor parts
machine plant and tractor assembly plant.
27.       Transportation.  The IMT Belgrade factory is located in an indus-
trial area with direct access to the main highway and the urban road system.
The Company has no direct rail-link. The project envisages an annual trans-
port requirement of 130,000 tons for raw materials, parts and supplies:
(a) fuels, greases and liquified gas will be delivered by NAFTAGAS using
special vehicles, (b) IMT will transport engines from IMR (13,420 tons),
castings from FOB (24,000 tons), tires from REKORD (4,000 tons), paints and
lacquers (300 tons) with its own trucks and forklifts. Transport of the re-
maining quantities will be arranged through rail and outside transport enter-
prises.

Out of 3,443 workers, 2,151 will be associated with tractor production and
584 with implements manufacturing.
3.        About 523 new staff will be needed for the General and Services
Departments, according to the following projections:-

Total                    1,304                  1,836
Despite this considerable increase of services and auxiliary staff, the im-
portant contribution of the expansion project is the employment generation
for skilled and unskilled workers. IMT projects that by 1976 57% of the person-
nel in the tractor and implements production will be direct labor as compared
to 47% in 1973.



ANNEX 4-3
Page 3
4.        A comparison between IMT's projected total labor force and the per-
centage of indirect labor indicates that the number of workers required is
about 10-15% above US standards for plants of similar size. However, the
INT labor force projections are acceptable in view of the selection of machine
tools, the lack of emphasis on fully automated transfer lines and economic con-
siderations. DMT's plant layout is relatively labor-intensive and therefore
has a positive effect on the Yugoslav employment problem.
Training and Recruitment
5.        DIT does not anticipate any difficulties in recruiting the addi-
tional number of workers and employees required for each skill level. The
Company is well known in Yugoslavia for its technical excellence as well as
social and economic benefits, and has continuously attracted applicants.
6.        The manpower program for the expansion project foresees direct re-
cruitment of workers and staff as well as training of the present labor force.
The project includes Din 7.0 million for training purposes. IMT plans to
hire 324 of the required 646 highly skilled (KV) workers according to the
following skill types and time plan:
1973     1974      1975     Total
Grinding machine operators             -         2         12        14
IIilling machine operators             6        11         15        32
Automechanics                         10        25         25        60
Auto-tinsmiths                         4         2          4        10
Auto-locksmiths                        -         1          2         3
Tool makers                            6        20         20        46
Metal abraders                        14        20         30        64
Machine locksmiths                    12        38         30        80
Temperers                              -         3         12        15
52      122        150       324
In addition, 70 - 90 semi-skilled (PK) workers presently employed by IMT,
will annually complete the prescribed course at the Workers University in
Belgrade and receive the KV qualification. For the training of unskilled
workers (NK) for skilled (PK) qualifications, IMT uses its own school and
on the job training.
8.        To attract professional staff IMT has been giving scholarships to
students who join the Company upon completion of their studies. The projected
need for VSS level staff in 1976 will be covered by this type of recruitment.

1.        Total cost of building and civil construction amounts to Din 173.0
million.  IMT signed the construction contract in May 1973 with Gredjevinsko
Preduzece "RATKO MITROVIC," a well-known contractor in Belgrade. "RATKO MITROVIC"
was selected from five Yugoslav construction companies which had submitted
their bids following local competitive bidding procedures. Specifications,
and terms and conditions of the contract have been reviewed and are satisfac-
tory. The contractor "RATKO MITROVIC" is responsible for all major buildinig and
civil construction related to IMT's expansion program, including a) ground
levelling and final engineering, erection or installation of b) main buildings
and annexes, c) water, electric and heating systems, d) power, gas and com-
pressor stations, e) open and covered storage spaces and f) roads and land-
scaping. 1/
B.   Equipment Cost (Item 2)
2.        Equipment cost estimates are based on a) actual prices prevailing
in 1973 or b) on late 1972 or 1973 quotations from potential suppliers in the
USA, and Western and Eastern European countries. IMT has divided all equip-
ment items according to the financing and procurement sources: a) Din 111.5
million or about 25% of total estimated equipment cost will be procured from
Yugoslav manufacturers, b) some standard machine tools, heat treatment and
inventory equipment totalling Din 22.0 million are earmarked for purchases in
clearing countries, c) an estimated Din 47.6 million of equipment will be
imported from IMT sources of convertible currency. These items originally ear-
marked for Bank financing are now being directly procured and paid for by DMT,
in order to meet the project schedule. Bids for the paint shops and the equip-
ment for internal sheet metal transDort have already been received and are
presently being evaluated. d) Bank-financed equipment is estimated at approxi-
mately 60% of total equipment cost. It is expected that most of this equipment
will be imported, since items for which competitive Yugoslav suppliers exist
have generally been included in the exclusively locally procured category.
3.        Detailed cost estimates for foreign and local equipment are given
below. It includes a provision for spare parts for equipment from convertible
mirrency countries only. IMT maintains that the remaining equipment consists
of' .s:-!ard machines and that the ordering and supply of spare parts from
"'astern European and Yugoslav equipment manufacturers is adequate so that an
increase of spare parts inventory for these equipment items will not be neces-
sary.

terrain, was underway.

cludes no foreign exchange component. The estimate of Din 27.6 million based
on recently quoted railway, handling and insurance charges.



ANNEX 5-1

D.   Duty and Taxes (Item 4)
5.        Duty and taxes, totalling Din 103.8 million, are calculated accord-
ing to the Drevailing tariff rates for machine tools and equipment which came
into effect on February 26, 1973. The present customs duty for machine tools
and special equipment varies from 19-21% of the cif value (Yugoslav border).
For the capital cost estimate 21% duty has been uniformly assumed. In addi-
tion to the customs duty, taxes of 9% on the cif value (Yugoslav border) - 3%
import tax and 6% special tax - have to be paid for all imported items.
E.   Erection anid Installation Cost (Item 5)
6.        In line with IMT's past experience erection and installation cost
have been estimated as 4.5% of foreign and local equipment cost value.
F.   Contingency (Item 6)
7.        To the total cost estimates, based on a detailed breakdown into
buildings, civil works, equipment as well as financing and procurement sources,
the following contingencies have been added to account for minor changes and
omissions: a) 10% for buildings and civil works as well as equipment from
convertible currency countries; b) 2% for equipment from clearing countries
and c) 3% for locally procured equipment. The lower contingencies for
Yugoslav and Eastern European equipment seems justified, since these items
are predominantly standard machine tools whose design changes infrequently
and with which IMT is familiar. Considering the advanced stage of project
preparation, the contingency provision should be adequate.
G.   Price Escalation (Item 7)
8.        Civil construction and local as well as Western European equipment
cost have been increasing at the rate of 6-10% p.a. during the past two years.
In order to account for future price and construction cost increases, price
escalations have been included in the investment costs. In view of the steps
being taken by the Federal Government of Yugoslavia, the domestic inflation
rate is expected to drop, so that the following escalation rates have been
assumed for civil works, domestic equipment, erection, transport and insurance
costs: 1974-8% and 1975-6%. With regard to foreign equipment, a 6% inflation
rti  Per year has been adopted uniformly for clearing and convertible currency
countries. Based on these assumptions, total price escalation is estimated
at Din 90.0 million (49.8 on domestic cost and 40.2 on foreign exchange costs),
i.e., about 11% of total fixed assets.
H.   Engineering, Pre-operating and Start-up Expenses (Item 8)
9.     1 According to Yugoslav law, these expenses are allowed to be capital-
ized only if they are costs incurred outside the company, i.e., consulting
services, fees, outside training. However, all costs related to on-the-job



ANNEX 5-1
Page 5
training and project services performed by IMT staff are charged directly to
the income statement. IMT envisages special training costs of about Din 2
million and consulting fees of about Din 4.7 million.
I.   Incremental Working Capital
10.       Details of calculations and underlying assumptions are given in
Annex 5-2.
J.   Interest During Construction
11.       Interest during construction is calculated on the basis of expected
disbursements for local and foreign loans. All foreign interest charges re-
late to the Bank loan, since interest on bilateral credits from clearing
countries is payable in Dinar. According to Yugoslav regulations interest
during construction may not be capitalized. However, the enterprises have
the right a) to borrow from their house bank an amount up to the interest
during construction, to be paid back in several installments after construction
completion and b) to charge the total interest during construction to the
income statement during this later period. For the current projections,
interest during construction is charged to the income statements for the
period 1976 to 1980.

ANNEX 6-2
Fake I-'  -
YUGOSLAVIA - DMT TRACTOR EXPANSION PROJECT
Raw Materials, Parts & Supplies
A.   Suppliers' Classification and Problems
1.        Timely and economical supply of raw material, parts and supplies is
crucial for IMT's production, which is primarily an assembly type operation.
The project more than doubles DMT's demand for raw material and parts thus
requiring careful inventory planning and control. The Company is aware of
the importance of adequate supply arrangements for successful project implemen-
tation. The measures to be taken are described below and should minimize
bottlenecks after expansion.
2.        Purchasing and inventory control of raw material, parts and sup-
plies are handled directly by the Production Planning and Control Department.
After project completion this function will be computerized. To establish a
reliable supply system, domestic and local suppliers are classified in four
groups A, B, C and D according to the:
a)   range of the suppliers' production program and com-
patibility with IMT's needs;
b)   extent of similar business interests between IMT and
the supplier;
c)   extent of suppliers' specialization;
d)   membership in the UMI group;
e)   capability to expand supply according to IMT's expan-
sion program; and
f)   distance between the suppliers' plant and Belgrade,
and transport facilities.
Category A suppliers are those who fulfill or score high on all the
above criteria. Suppliers classified in Category B presently do not meet all
criteria, but have been reliable suppliers in the past or are currently under-
taking currently expansion programs in line with IfT's development and pro-
duction program. Category C and D suppliers do not meet more than two of
the above criteria.
3.        Long-term contracts have been established or are presently negotia-
ted with Category A and B suppliers. IMT expects to eliminate all regular
purchases from C & D suppliers for major items until project completion by
seeking out and engaging additional companie:; which qualify for the B cate-
gory. The present distribution of suppliers by category is as follows:

B                      4
C&D                     5
4.        Total requirements for raw materials and parts during any period
are supplied by at least two different companies to avoid total dependence
on one supplier. The majority of domestic supply arrangements are one-year
contracts:  a) fLT informs its suppliers by June 15 of the projected yearly
demand; b) contracts for the following year are signed by the end of October;'
and c) definite orders for the first quarter are given in October and, for
the remainder of the year, in January. Despite the relatively long lead tiAi
given, prompt delivery is not guaranteed. Therefore, all components necessaky
for tractor or implements assembly are classified according to importance a i
availability in four groups: Group I parts -- delivery 10 days before asseu -
ling; Group II parts - 3 months prior to assembling; Group III parts 6 mont i
prior to assembling; Group IV parts -- annual production requirements. Abou
90% of LMT's annual requirements of parts have been Group I and II supplies.
5.        Although the supply situation regarding the main raw materials and
parts for the production of tractors, implements and machine tools is not
expected to be a major bottleneck for IMT's expansion, the Company's depen-
dence on timely delivery of components and parts is relatively high. Supply
problems will warrant the management's continuous attention.
B.   IMT Requirements and Suppliers
h.        The proposed expansion project will increase DIT's requirements for
raw materials, components and supplies up to the following quantities:

126,000
7.        Steel Products.  IMT requires various steel products including
steel bars, steel wires, flat and rolled steel and steel pipes primarily for
the machine tool production. At the present, there are eight steel plants
in Yugoslavia with a total capacity of about 2.,6 million tons per year of
crude steel equivalent. Their capacity is expected to increase to about 5
million tons by 1975, and 7 million tons by 1980. IMT will continue to cover
its demand for steel products from local suppliers, i.e., ZELJEZARA NIKSIC,
RAVNE, STORE, SKOPJE, SISAK, JESENICE, ZENICA, SMEDEREVO and K.O.M. PROKUPLJE.
Domestic steel works do not produce certain steel products, such as bar and
flat carbon steel or the special steel tubes required by IMT. The projected
annual requirement of about 2,000 tons of such products, after expansion,
will be covered by imports.
8.        Castings.  There are some 250 foundries in Yugoslavia producing
nearly 400,000 tons of steel iron and non-ferrous castings. DMT purchases
its total requirements for gray castings (e.g., flywheels or engine blocks)
and nodular castings (e.g., axle housing or transmission blocks) from FOB.
FOB and LMT had been one enterprise until 1971 and occupy production facili-
ties adjacent to each other.
9.        In October 1972, IMT signed a long-term (8 years) contract with
FOB. To meet IMT's demand for steel castings after project completion, IMT is
supporting FOB's expansion program with a Din 30 million loan at concessionary
terms. However, even after expansion FOB will not be able to supply a suf-
ficient number of castings for engine blocks and heads. The foundries ATMOS -
Maribor and PETAR DRAPSIN - Mladenovac have agreed to supply the necessary
quantities on a year-by-year negotiable basis. In addition, ATMOS - Maribor
will continue to meet IMT's silium casting requirements.



ANNEX 6-2
Page 4
10.       Forgings.  IMT's main suppliers of forgings CRVENA ZASTAVA, KOVACKA
INDUSTRIJA, aMAJ, MASINSKA INDUSTRIJA AND TOVARNA VERIG will continue to
cover IMT's total requirements for expansion. At present, the Company imports
rear axle forgings, but a local firm BRATSTVO - Novi Travnik is negotiating
a long-term contract with DMT.
11.       Pressings.  The main supplier of pressings is IKARUS, another UMI
member. The expansion plans of both companies have been coordinated.
12.       Rubber and Plastics.  IMT will be able to meet the requirements of
plastic products from three domestic suppliers; i.e., JOZE KERENCIC, GIP and
DES. Rubber goods will continue to be supplied by REKORD, MILOJE, ZAKIV,
VITOJEVAC, and GIP. 15 X 30 tires are currently imported from England, but
Rekord is testing local prototypes and should be able to supply IMT's need
by 1976.
13.       Engines.  IMT purclhases engines primarily from TMR, a UMI member.
The 3-year contract between the two companies stipulates the supply of a) TŽR
manufactured diesel engines of type S-4 and b) DIR-assembled Perkins engines.
rIT makes availaiYle the necessary foreign exchange to purchase the foreign
engine components.  The present capacity of DIMR is 17,000 engines per year.
The company is expanding to produce 40,000 engines annually, which would be
sufficient to meet IMT's requirements from a quantative point of view. IMT
has asked DPR to broaden its product range and produce 3-5 types of engines.
Such a change in DIR's production program would require an investment of Din
40 million. INT proposed to make available the amount required.
14.       Brakes.   The local suppliers RUEN, KOCANI and FAK, will continue
to meet TNT's demand after expansion.
15.       Clutches are supplied by FRAD, New Belgrade and RUEN, Kocani.  FRAD
is a member of the UMI group; the Company will expand its capacity in accord-
ance with IMT's increased production.
16.       Steering Wheel and Steering Assmbly.  The available capacities of
IMT's local suppliers, JOZE KERENCIC, Ormoz and SOKO, Master, will be suffi-
cient to meet IMT's future requirement.
17.       Batteries and Electrical Equipment.  All batteries are supplied by
TELSA, Brcka on the basis of a 4-year contract. The Company SATURNUS,
Ljubljana has agreed to provide head lamps and direction lights according to
a 3-year contract between the two companies. In exchange IMT has agreed to
meet Saturnus' foreign exchange obligations for imports of raw materials and
components. The main suppliers of other electrical equipment (battery cables,
cable terminates, etc.) are 26 SEPTEMBAR, Krupanj, STANDARD, Bosanska Gradiska,
AGROVOJVODINA, Novi Sad and AGROPREMA, Belgrade. These companies will con-
tinue to meet DIT's requirements after project completion.



ANNEX 6-2
Page 5
18.       Wheels.  The major Yugoslav producer of wheels is LUBRAVA, Sremska
Mitrovica. This company is presently completing an expansion program which
would result in production capacity sufficient to supply IMT's increased
demand. DMT is negotiating with ZMAJ, Zemum as back-up supplier.
19.       Tools.  IMT will require the following quantities of machine tools
after project completion:
Fastening tools                 3,200 positions
Lamps                           1,500 positions
Other fastening tools           19700 positions
Cutting tools                   5,900 positions
Measuring tools                 4,950 positions
Forgings & pressing tools       1,090 positions
Accessories                     5,700 positions
Total                    24,040 positions
Approximately 88% of the required quantities will be manufactured
by IMT, but tv1 company expects to purchase in the future more machine tools
from domestic or foreign specialized suppliers. In particular, INT will im-
port Harbetok knives for conic straight toothing, Klingelnberg knives for
toothing, Oerlikon knives for toothing plate holders from hard metals, plates
from hard metals and micro drillers.
20.       Other Parts and Supplies.  IMT has discussed with the present: sup-
pliers of other parts and supplies its requirements after project completion.
The capacities of these companies should be sufficient and no bottlenecks are
expected. The potential and present main suppliers are: a) for fuel and oil -
JUGOPETROL, Belgrade; b) for paints and lacquers - KOLOR, Medvode; c) for
instruments and flexible shafts - TELEOPTIK, Zemun and RUDI CAJAVEC, Banja
Luka; d) for springs - SLAVKO RODIC, Bugojna and FENOR, Nova Raca; e) for
screw parts - TVIK, Krin, VIS, Svilajinac, ELIND, Valjevo, IGMAN, Konjic;
and f) 10 small companies for the supply of seals, washers, tubings, pins
and chains.
C.   Imports
20.       Imports of raw materials and parts are allowed under three main
systems: (a) the GDK system; (b) the RK system; and (c) the LB system. Un-
der the GDK system, companies which export are allowed to import about 25%
of their raw material requirements for export production. Under the RK sys-
tem, imports of specific items are determined as commodity contingents by
the concerned Yugoslav industrial associations. Under the LB system, no
limits are imposed on the import of specific items. In addition, companies
can use their retention quota (20% of exports) after foreign debt service
payments to import raw material and parts without restriction.

21.       The following table shows the custom duties on the import of IMT
main supply items and the import system under which they fall:
Taxes &
Custom Duties           Import
_                System
Electrical Equipment           19%                    GDK
Steel products                 22%                    GDK
Forgings                       28%                      RK
Castings                       28%                     RK
Engines                        28%                    GDK
Tires                          26%                    GDK
Bearings                       26%                     RK
Machine Tools                  19%                      RK
22.       Neither the present Yugoslav import system nor the availability of
foreign exchange for raw material and supplies is expected to pose any problems
for IMT's expanded production program. Imports of materials amount at pre-
sent to 7-10% of total material costs and are projected to decrease to 5-8%
by 1976. Selected components, tools and special steels will be imported from
the following countries: (a) England--bearings, liners, pumps, valves, small
tractor parts, steel; (b) FRG--needle bearings, cutting tools, micro drills,
extruders, steel: (c) Italy--semi-shafts, front axle, steel: (d) Austria--bear-
ings, compressors; (e) Belgium--diamond tools; (f) Switzerland--knives and
steel; (g) Sweden--tools; (h) Spain--tires.
23.       At present, the import content of the standard tractors IMT 533/558
is 3-5% compared to 45% for the 575/585 models. IMT plans to decrease imported
components for the 575 and 585 models to 8-10% until 1975 by procuring the
engines locally (IMR - Perkins). The new ones 100 hp model will rely on
imported gearlinks. Since the envisaged production volume for this product
size does not allow economical in-house development and production.
24.       Many of IMT's suppliers do not dispose of adequate import contin-
gents and foreign exchange rights to guarantee supply of import-dependent
parts and components. In these cases IMT will continue to finance directly
the import content of its supplies by making available to the suppliers its
own accumulated surplus foreign exchange rights.

2.        IMT depends on outside suppliers for all major components.  After
project completion there will be no essential change from the assembly type
operation.  IMT will expand the machining operation for tractor parts dispro-
portionately, thereby increasing the Company's value added to material cost
from about 5% in 1972 to not more than 8% after expansion.

Due to the assembly type operation, and the relatively low lev7el of
wages in Yugoslavia, IMT's cost structure is dominated by costs for raw
materials, parts and components. Total direct and indirect material cost
decreases from 81.5% of operating cost in 1972 to 78.4X in 1977, since the
expansion of IMT's production facilities allows an increase of machining of
tractor parts and components.
5.        Although tractor unit costs are expected to increase because of the
inflationary cost increases during project implementation, the project should
realize some economies of scale and cost decreases in constant prices as
illustrated by the following table:

ANNEX 6-3
Page 4
Unit cost for the standard IMT 533/558 models are estimated to decrease by
1-3% only, since they have already been produced on a large scale in 1972.
In addition, the project is not expected to decrease unit costs of maintenance,
administration and selling expenses for at least 3-5 years after project
completion, since the Company has to strengthen its marketing activities,
and past maintenance and repair cost had been particularly low in anticipa-
tion of the expansion and the related new investment. In the case of the
IMT-575 and IMT-585 models, the Company should realize economies of scale of
20-25% per unit by (i) increasing the present pilot production to economical
production lots of about 1,500 tractors/year, and (ii) decreasing the import
content of these models from a present 45% to an average of 8-10% by 1975
(Annex 6-2, para. 23).
6.        IMT has not yet prepared unit cost calculations for the new 20-25 hp
tractor and the above 100 hp model which IMT intends to introduce after
project completion. The Company expects to realize for these tractors profit
margins which are substantially lover than those for its standard models
(2-5% as compared with 10%). As for the 100 hp tractor, the projected annual
production of 400 units does neither allow economies of scale nor does it
justify special development effort on the part of IMT's research and develop-
ment department. Consequently, to break-even, the tractor model will rely
to a large extent on parts used for the IMT-575/585 models and imported com-
ponent. As to the small 20-25 hp tractors the model choice and production
strategy (licensing vs. own development) has not been finalized. However,
in view of the considerable competition in this products range and IMT's
initial cost of tooling up, the Company does not expect to realize notable
profits for the 20-25 hp tractor during the first few years of produc_.ion.
Nevertheless, IMr desires to enter the market segments for the 20-25 hp
tractors and above 100 hp units in order to (i) offer the full range of
tractor types on the domestic market and (ii) thereby strengthen its market
position vis-a-vis present and potential competitors.

YUGOSLAVIA - IMT TRACTOR EXPANSION PROJECT
I. FINANCIAL PROFITABILITY
Input for the Financial Rate of Return Calculations
1.        The financial rate of return calculations are based on financial
cost and benefit streams expressed in real value terms i.e. The financial
projections in case of expansion and without expansion (Annex 7-1) as well as
the project cost have been adjusted to reflect real prices. A comparison
of IMT's financial cost and benefit streams with and without expansion results
in the following incremental position:

IMT's expansion project will be completed by late 1975 and is
expected to produce at full capacity 35,000 tractors per year in 1976. 1/
The year 1978 was chosen as the basis for the break-even-point analysis
since it is the first full year of IBRD loan repayment.

YUGOSLAVIA - IMT TRACTOR EXPANSION PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
I.   Assumptions for the Economic Rate of Return Calculations
1.        The economic cost/benefit stream has been derived from the financial
projections (Annex 7-1) and the financial cost/benefit streams (Annex 7-5).
The latter have been modified (a) to replace the commercial benefit stream
with one based on the opportunity costs of tractor and agricultural Implements
import to Yugoslavia, and (b) to eliminate taxes and duties from the cost
streams. In view of the present and projected economic situation in Yugoslavia,
no shadow pricing of labor of foreign exchange rate has been employed.
2.        Revenues.  The revenue stream in the economic cost/benefit projec-
tions comprises the expenditures Yugoslavia would have to incur to import
comparable tractors and agricultural implements, if IMT would not choose to
produce this agricultural machinery domestically. Accordingly, the economic
benefit stream has been based on the lowest international prices (cif
Yugoslav border) of comparable products expressed in real value terms. The
price comparison (Annex 3, paras. 21-24) indicates that Yugoslavia could
import tractors ex duties and taxes from clearing countries about 15% below
the domestic price level.
3.        Project Cost.  The unescalated financial project cost has been
reduced by duties and taxes totalling Din 103.8 million (Annex 5-1).
4.        Personnel Cost:  No shadow pricing of labor has been employed.  How-
ever, total labor cost as well as the labor cost of maintenance and repair,
and administration and selling expenses have been adjusted by excluding 9%
taxes and contributions to the Government.
5.        Raw Materials and Components Prices.  Material inputs for the eco-
nomic operating cost stream have been valued at comparable international
prices (cif Yugoslav border and excluding Yugoslav duties and taxes) as
detailed below:
