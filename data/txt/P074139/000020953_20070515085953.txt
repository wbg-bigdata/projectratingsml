I. STRATEGICCONTEXTANDRATIONALE
A.        Countryandsector issues

1.        The Republic of Moldova is a small, landlocked country situated between the western border of
Ukraine and the eastern border of Romania. The population of 4.3 million is predominantly rural with
60% of the population living in towns and villages of fewer than 10,000 people and approximately 20%
living in the capital Chisinau. Moldova became independent in 1991 as part of the break-up of the
Former Soviet Union (FSU) and its per capita GNP of US$ 720 makes it the poorest country in Europe.
Independence was accompanied by the disruption of trade and budget subsidies, price shocks from
liberalization of the economy, conflict with Transnistria in 1992 and a series of natural disasters. Since
2000, the economy has improved, fueled by remittances from those worlung abroad and the poverty rate
has been halved from 70% to 35%.         However, for those remaining in Moldovajob opportunities are still
limited.

2.        The NistruRiver (also known as the Dniester River), a transboundary river with a length of 1352
km, starts inthe UkrainianCarpathians, flows through Moldova andreaches Ukraine again near the Black
Sea. More than 5 million people populate its basin. In the FSU, the water basin was managed as one
system, but since 1991Moldova and Ukraine have separately managed their respective parts. The Nistru
River is the main source of drinking water for Moldova and for a significant part of Ukraine, including
the City of Odessa. The Nistru i s under environmental pressure from municipal and industrial point
sources and from agricultural non-point sources. Nistru's pollution has an international dimension that
affects Moldoba, Ukraine and the Black Sea.

3.        The wastes borne by the Nistru River ultimately discharge into the Black Sea and adversely
impact its ecology. Moldova i s one of 17 countries inthe Black Sea basin, which covers about one third
of continental Europe and houses 162 million people. Once a rich fishing ground and vacation site for
millions of people, the Black Sea ecosystem has been overwhelmed by excess levels of nutrients from
agricultural runoff and industrial and municipal wastewater discharges. Areas of the Black Sea have
become eutrophied due to the nutrient loads and the loss of wetlands that once servedas a filter.

4.        The Government of Moldova strongly supports the GEF Environmental Infrastructure Project to
fulfill its obligations under several international agreements to protect transboundary water courses from
pollution. First, an agreement signed with Ukraine in 1995, calls on the signatories to cooperate injoint
use and protection of transboundary water courses and transnational lakes. This agreement followed the
spirit and intent of the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and
InternationalLakes adopted in Helsinh in March 1992 and made effective in October 1996. Second, the
Government of Moldova signed a Joint Memorandum of Understanding, dated April 1997, on
cooperation with Ukraine for development of a transnational water quality management plan for the
Nistru River Basin. Third, Moldova i s a member of the Danube River Commission, an unofficial member
of the Black Sea Commission and a party to many Black SedDanube cooperation agreements. Moldova
and Ukraine have been worhng on a cooperative project under the auspices of the Organization for
Cooperation and Security inEurope (OSCE) and the UNEconomic Commission for Europe (UNECE).

5.        The quality and reliability of Moldova's water supply and wastewater services are generally
deficient. The existing wastewater facilities have insufficient capacity and have deteriorated after decades
of little maintenance. It i s estimated that only four out of the 100 existing wastewater treatment plants are
meeting effluent standards. The quality of drinking water delivered to consumers is generally poor and
service is intennittent. Approximately 80% o f urban residents are connected to centralized water supply
networks and 63% to sewerage. The coverage insmall and medium-sized towns for water supply i s about
60% and for sewerage about 35%.



                                                       7

6.       The central authority responsible for the development and promotion o f state policy for water
supply utilities is the Agency for Construction and Territorial Development (ACTD). The Ministry of
Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR) is responsible for environment and natural resources. The
Ministry of Healthmonitors water quality through its Public HealthBureaus. The Ministry of Agriculture
deals with agricultural non-point source pollution and with the design of rural water schemes that are
locally operated. In small and medium sized cities, water and wastewater systems are operated by the
semi-autonomous Apa Canals, which are responsible to their respective local governments and are
representedat the national level by the Moldova Apa Canal Association (MAC). Other stakeholders are
represented through the more than 100 national environmental NGOs that are officially registered in
Moldova. ACTD was designated as the agency responsible for setting and implementing policy for water
and sanitation services for both urban and rural areas under Decree No. 1406 dated December 30, 2005,
which constitutes the Plan for Water Supply and Sewerage in Localities of the Republic of Moldova up to
2015.

7.       In 1997, the European Bank of Reconstruction Development (EBRD) approved a loan of USD
22.75 million to replace sections of the Chisinau water network, and later the Danish Cooperation for
Environment in Eastern Europe (DANCEE) approved a loan to finance water supply systems in three
rural villages. In 2003, the World Bank approved a US$ 12 million IDA Credit for the Pilot Water
Supply and Sanitation Project targeting the cities of Balti, Cahul, Orhei, Soroca, and Stefan Voda. With
the exception of these three projects, Moldova has not received any significant investment financing and
now runs the risk of not meeting its targets under the Millennium Development Goals. Wastewater
investments are lagging even brther behind because the emphasis has been to first rehabilitate existing
water supply systems to make production and consumption more efficient.

8.       The key sector issues include weak Apa Canals that cannot collect sufficient revenue to pay for
adequate operations and maintenance let alone for investment; excessively politicized tariff setting; and a
lack of proper regulation. The Government is cognizant of the sector flaws. In order to update its sector
development strategy, the Government organized a strategy workshop on October 26, 2006 that gathered
all national stakeholders and many international agencies. The Workshop adopted a resolution that,
among other matters, appealed to all external financial agencies to assign high priority to the water and
wastewater sector given the fact that so little was invested over the last decade.

9.       The Trans-boundary Diagnostic Analysis, carried out on the basis of a pollution source inventory
for the Black Sea Environmental Program, reveals that Moldova accounts for about 2% of the total
nutrient load into the Black Sea. Agriculture accounts for the bulk of Moldova's emissions of nitrogen
and phosphorus, and municipal wastes are second in importance. The EU Nitrate Directive notes that
investments dedicated to urban wastewater treatment will have a limited impact on reducing nutrients if
agricultural nutrient loads are not reduced. The reduction of agricultural-source nutrients i s the global
environmental objective of the ongoing GEF-funded Moldova Agricultural Pollution Control Project
(US$4.95 million, 2004). Now, Moldova wishes to complement those efforts by focusing on reducing
nutrient loads from urban areas. The proposed projectwould pioneer the effort to reduce municipal Nand
P emissions. The project's impact i s expected to be multipliedthrough the replication of its appropriate,
low-cost wastewater treatment technology.

B.       Rationale for Bank involvement

10.      The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) has identified poverty reduction, economic
growth and public sector reform as Moldova's key challenges. The CAS assigns priority to the protection
of the country's ecology and rich biodiversity from mismanagement of land resources, land-based
pollution and impacts of the tourism industry. The proposedproject would target pollution from the town


                                                      8

of Soroca that contributes to the environmental degradation of a stretch of the Nistru River running550
km downstream of Soroca before entering the Black Sea. The project is consistent with the CAS for
Moldova and the country's National Water Action Plan. The project also complements the Bank's GEF
project for Agricultural Pollution Control (US$4.95 million, 2004), the objective of which is to reduce
agricultural discharges of nutrients into local water bodies and ultimately into the Black Sea.

11.      The Bank's support through sector work and the Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation Project
(PWSSP) is assisting the improvement and reform of Moldova's water and sanitation sector. The Bank's
active involvement aims at reversing water quality deterioration, and the threat to public health and
environmental quality. The proposed GEF project would leverage the Bank's ongoing initiatives by (i)
expanding and strengthening the physical and sector objectives of the PWSSP; (ii)improving the
probability of obtaining donor commitments; and (iii)      assisting Moldova in addressing transboundary
environmental problems with Ukraine and the regionalpollution of the Black Sea.

C.       Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

12.      The higher level objectives of the project are to (i) the nutrient load of the NistruRiver by
                                                             reduce
reducingorganic pollution from the Soroca municipal sewer system, and (ii)     improve the water quality o f
the Black Sea.

13.      The project objectives comply with GEF eligibility criteria and its Operational Strategy for
International Waters, as well as for the Water body Based Operational Programme-8 (OP-8) through (i)
the focus on addressing specific impairments of the water body, such as reducing eutroplvcation or toxic
substances on inland waters; and (ii)  support for the learning process for countries to work cooperatively
and collectively inaddressingimminent threats to their transboundary water resources.

14.      GEF support is justified by the expected reduction of nutrients discharged to a tributary to the
Black Sea; by the demonstration and replication effect of the proposed interventions; and by the training
and awareness-raising impacts of the project. The proposed project will help prioritize environmental
concerns as identifiedin the Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis, the Black Sea Strategic Action Plan and
a definitive study that was conducted under the GEF project.

15.     Moldova, as one of the 17 signatories of the GEF Strategic Partnership, would contribute to
meeting the objectives through the Soroca wastewater treatment project in a number of ways.
Specifically, the project would directly support the objectives of the Black SeaDanube Strategic
Partnership-Nutrient Reduction Investment Fund through: (a) its reduction of nutrient loads on the
transboundary Nistru River and on the Black Sea; and (b) its potential for replication of its nutrient
reduction that would benefit Moldova, the neighboring Ukraine, and other countries within the Strategic
Partnership. The potential replication could be substantial given that Moldova alone has 100 existing
wastewater treatment works of which only four meet their effluent standards. The demonstration effect
from a successful Sorocaproject with its appropriate technology would offer a low cost alternative to the
rehabilitationof many of the existingplants that are basedon high-cost and energy intensive technologies.
Inparticular, the towns of Criuleni, Otaci, Rezina, and Soldanesti on the Nistru River lack wastewater
treatment as do the towns of Calarasi and Ungheni. These six are potential candidates for the technology
usedfor the Sorocaproject.

16.     The dissemination and replication of the Soroca project's experience will be facilitated by
Moldova's membership in the Istanbul Commission to which the outcome of the project will be reported.
Through this mechanism, the Soroca technology could catalyze investment projects in other member
states whose effluents and nutrient loads reach the Black Sea. Soroca is a good example of one of the



                                                      9

three types of project that can be financed by the Investment Fund: that of wastewater treatment in
communities and industries, for reduction of nutrientdischarges. The Soroca project also complies with
the Investment Fund emphasis on monitoring and evaluation of nutrient reductions from individual
projects.

17.     The project will also link to the GEF Black Sea Regional project, Danube Convention-supported
dissemination activities and the GEF-funded I W Learn initiative. In this regard, the project will include:
settingup a Project website consistent with the GEF IW: LEARNguidance, participation of project staff
in IW: LEARN activities, participation in GEF International Waters portfolio conferences, and
participation in Black Sea coordination meetings.

C.      Project development and globalenvironmentalobjectives and key indicators

19.     The overall project development and global environmental objectives of the proposed project are
to: (i)improve the quality of sanitation services in Soroca; (ii)reduce the discharge of pollutants,
including nutrients, from Soroca municipal sources that flow into the Nistru River and, subsequently, into
the Black Sea; and (iii)demonstrate and disseminate through feasibility studies and workshops, cost-
effective and affordable technologies for municipal wastewater treatment for the potential benefit of
similar projects for Moldova's existing wastewater treatment plants, for those towns inMoldova that have
no wastewater treatment, and for the countries that drain into the Black Sea.

20.     The key indicators are:


    0   The reduction of biological and nutrientwastes discharged from Soroca; and
    0   The number of events for dissemination and replicationof CW technology pioneered in Soroca.

21.     Monitoring and performance indicators will include:


    0   the volume of wastewater effectively treatedbefore and after the project completion(&/year);

    0   the reduction of pollutants (including suspended solids, BOD and P and N nutrients), calculated
        as the difference between the pollutants discharged before and after the project (tondyear); and

    0   the number of proposed replications of the low-cost wastewater treatment technology in
        feasibility studies planned for Moldova and its neighboringcountries.

D.       Project components

22.      The Soroca municipality was selectedbecause: (i) Government has assignedhighpriority to
                                                            the
treating Soroca's waste water that is presently discharged untreated into the Nistru river that separates
much of Moldova and Ukraine, and the Government wishes to honor its international commitment with
Ukraine; and (ii)Soroca has improved its water supply system under the PWSSP under which
participatingApa Canals are committed to collect tariffs to cover its operations and maintenance costs.

The project consists of the following components:

Component 1-A: Wastewater managementin Soroca(US$7.89 million).

23.      This component would finance: (i)  the rehabilitation of wastewater collection system, necessary
sewerage pressure pipelines and the construction of wastewater treatment facility using constructed
wetlands technology for the municipality of Soroca; and (ii) six months' operations of the facility inorder
to train the Apa Canal staff inthe proper operations and maintenance of the facility.

Component 1-B: Engineering Consultant and TA (US$1.48 million).

24.      This component would support: (i)Engineering services for WWTP and sewer network design,
procurement, supervision support, and a six months' operational assistance for WWTP; and
(ii)Feasibility studies for 10 towns and pre-feasibility studies for an additional 5 towns, including
replicationof constructedwetland system inthe studies.

Component 2: Dissemination and Replication Component related to Constructed Wetlands (USSO. 10
million).

25.      This component targets the dissemination of experience and knowledge obtained from operation
of the new Soroca WWTP. This is considered of particular importance due to the pioneeringcharacter of
this GEF project, which could prove exemplary to many other WWTPs inMoldova and in Ukraine. To
this end, the new operation building at the WWTP will include facilities suited for seminars and
workshops. The annual water monitoring workshops would expand in scope and participation with the
growing data base and with the progress of treatment of the Soroca wastewater. The first annual
workshop in year 3 would likely mainly have Moldovan participation; the second annual workshop in
year 4 might have Moldovan and Ukrainian participation, and possibly wider internationalparticipation in
coordination with the Istanbul Commission.

Component 3: Institutional Strengthening Component (USSO. 15 million).

26.      This component would finance: (i)the development of a communication strategy and capacity
building for media campaign and community and civil- society outreach to prepare for the necessary
increase of a sewage treatment surcharge; and (ii)   Apa Canal staff training for operational efficiency
improvements.

Component 4: Project Management (US$0.28 million)

27.     This component would support management and implementation of the project, including
auditing services, by PIU inthe ACTD.

E.      Lessonslearnedand reflectedin the projectdesign

28.     The lessons learned from similar projects that have been incorporated in the project design
include:

        0 Creating client ownership at all levels of Government by preparing the project in close
          collaboration and implementation with the local stakeholders.         Total commitment by the
          Ministry,Apa Canals and Municipal Governments is necessaryto ensure that preparation and
          implementation proceed smoothly;

        0 Setting realistic and prudent efficiency improvement targets, including a basis for sound
          financial projections. Under the PWSSP, a Financial Action Plan was agreed upon, with a
          specific collection increaseprogram that will be updated and monitoredbi-annually. This will
          be extendedto the GEF project;

        0 Selecting a treatment technology that will be appropriate for the staff competence of the
          Soroca Apa Canal and that will keep the necessary sewage treatment surcharge within the
          limits of affordability and willingness-to-pay of the Soroca population who needs to pay for
          the costs of operations and maintenanceto ensure sustainability;

        0 Establishing a sound institutional framework to ensure that the project is sustainable. A clear
          definition of project responsibilities and processes was established under the Pilot Project and
          will also be followed under the GEF project; and

          Implementing effective monitoringand evaluation mechanisms to measureproject impacts and
          disseminate and scale up the lessons learnt into subsequentprojects.

F.      Alternatives consideredand reasonsfor rejection

    e  Project Implementing Unit. Generally, there is a preference to avoid establishing a separate
       project implementation unit, because it may affect permanent capacity buildinginline ministries
        and Apa Canals. However, a well-functioning PIUnow exists for the ongoing Pilot Water
        Supply and Sanitation Project, and the intent is to buildon that proven capacity and have that PIU
        implementthe GEF project. The PIU is well integrated within the ACTD and i s staffedby
       Moldovannationals who are likely to stay within the sector and work on similar future activities.

B.       Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

29.      InstitutionalArrangements. The PIU, fimded under the Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation Project
(PWSSP), would implement the GEF project under the overall responsibility of ACTD. This seamless
transition will help in accelerating the implementation of the GEF project. The PIU is legally registered
and reports to the Agency. The PIU consists of a Project Director, Procurement Officer, a Sanitary
Engineer, Civil Engineer, a Water Quality Specialist (part-time), Financial Specialist, and Accountant
Cashier (part-time). Inaddition, a Steering Committeebasedwithin ACTD would assist to provide policy
guidance regarding project implementation. The PIU, in coordination with the Apa Canal, would be
responsible for all aspects of project financial managementand disbursement.

30.      Procurvment Arrangements. The Procurement Officer hiredand trained under the PWSSP would
be assigned to the GEF project. This would ensure that procurement is timely and efficient inaccordance
with the Bank's guidelines. The PIU would have overall responsibility for project implementation,
includingprocurement actions, incoordinationwith the Soroca Apa Canal.

3 1.     Disbtmements.      Disbursements from the Grant will be made based on transaction based
disbursement methods (i.e.,      from the Designated Account with reimbursements made based on
Statements o f Expenditures (SOEs) and full documentation, and direct payments from the Grant
Account). The Government will establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable
to the Bank a separate Designated Account denominated ina freely convertible and stable currency. The
Bank and the client, usingthe Bank's criteria for Designated Account (DA) banks, will evaluate the extent
to which local commercial banks meet the requirements and the client will select a bank, subject to the
Bank's approval. The PIU will use a local project account for the counterpart contributions to the Project.

32.     Flow ofFunds. Project funds will flow from: (i) Bank, either via a single Designated Account
                                                         the
which will be replenished based on SOEs and full documentation as appropriate; (ii)Direct Payment
method as well as Special Commitments may be used; and (iii)     the Government, via the Treasury at the
Ministry of Finance (MOF), on the basis of payment requestsprepared by the PIU. The Government will
authorize the State Agency, through the PIU, to use the grant proceeds. There will be one single
Designated Account for the whole project implementation. An Implementation Agreement will be signed
between ACTD and the Soroca Apa Canal, which shall state that the Soroca Apa Canal is responsible for
the implementation and management of Component 1, for which the PIU will execute the payments as
well as for Components 2, 3, and4.

33.     The IDA contribution of US$3.21 million refers to the contribution to the GEF project from the
PWSSP that is expected to be completed by December 31, 2007. The expenditure corresponds to
investments for urgent rehabilitation of the Soroca water supply system and sewer network and pumping
stations, feasibility study and PIU incremental operation cost. Completion of all components under the
GEF project is expected by December 15, 2011.            The government contribution is committed in
association with Decree # 947. The government will allocate a total amount of US$ 1.30 million during
FY2008 to FY2011, in accordance with the disbursement projection for each year.                The Soroca
Municipality will provide the land for the WWTP free of charge ($0.77 million value equivalent).

C.       Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

34.     The monitoring and evaluation of outcomes and results during implementation would follow
standard Bank practice and be carried out in conjunction with the PWSSP that has a proven capacity for
producingpertinent and timely monitoring data. The project outcome indicators are listed inAnnex 3 and
comprise the levels of BOD, Suspended Solids and nutrient concentrations of the incoming and outgoing
wastewater flows. The Project ImplementationUnitwould collect and present data and reports for review
by Bank supervision missions. Discussions during supervision related to institutional capacity building,
financial viability, technical reviews and site visits would provide an effective means of monitoring
progress.

D.       Sustainability and Replicability

35.     The sustainability of the GEF project i s closely linked to the operational effectiveness of the
PWSSP, which has among its objectives: (i)   targeting fundingto least-cost investments that reduce energy
and other operating costs; (ii) promoting financial viability of the Apa Canals by improving efficiency
and increasing revenues to cover operating and maintenance costs; (iii) training operational staff; and (iv)
informing consumerson the importance of paying for services.

36.     The GEF project will train the staff from Soroca Apa Canal to reduce operating costs and
undertake preventive maintenance of the planned WWTP. The Soroca WWTP will be the first municipal
WWTP with nutrient removal capacity in the Moldova Nistru River Basin. The Soroca municipality and
the Apa Canal planto organize a conference on wastewater managementfor regional informationtransfer
at the Soroca WWTP site. With these activities, the project will support the establishment of partnerships
between cities and towns of the region and will also provide a model to enable implementation of
successfulprocesses.

37.     The financial contribution and effort from the Moldovan side is considerable against the
background of the country's 2004 per capita GNP of USD 720, malung it the poorest country in Europe.
The central Government has agreed to budget USD 1.30 million for the project, apart from the IDA
contribution of USD 3.21 million that is repayable. At the local level, the Soroca municipal authorities
and the Apa Canal have agreed to charge a surcharge to pay for the incremental costs of operating the
wastewater treatment plant. This surcharge is estimated at USD 0.10 per cubic meter of wastewater and
will be collected by the SorocaApa Canal.

IV.     APPRAISAL SUMMARY
A.      Economic and financial analyses

Economic

38.     Economic cost/benefit analysis is difficult to apply to environmental projects such as the
proposed GEF project because there i s no market for the output of the project and, as a consequence,
benefits cannot be valued reliably. Water quality protectionwill benefit not only the population of Soroca
but also those who live downstream from the primary sources of pollution that the project will mitigate.
The downstream communities comprise Rezina, Ribnitsa, Dubasari, Criuleni, Grigoriopol, Tighina,
Vadul-lui-Voda, Tiraspol, Slobozia, Dnestrovsk, Olonesti, and Odessa with a combined population of 1.4
million. The length of the NistruRiver downstream of Soroca is 550 kmwith high and low flow rates at
Soroca of respectively 334 and 145 m 3 /second. Many of the benefits, such as better quality of life,
lowered risk of disease, and improved public health, are such that monetary valuation is tenuous. They
are therefore classified as intangible (although important) benefits.

39.     Given the impracticality of assigning a monetary value to the benefits, the economic analysis has
been limited to ensuring that the expected benefits are produced at the least cost to the economy. This
analysis comprises a number of steps:

        The demand for basic water supply services are projected based upon present demand. These
        evaluations are then used for projecting the volume of expected wastewater. It is positive that
        water consumption and production have become more efficient under the PWSSP since this will
        enable a more accurate projection of future demand, and since the wastewater treatment can be


                                                       16

        more economically designed.        The method of mahng projections helps to ensure that the
        expected water consumption patterns are reasonably efficient. In an on-site survey conducted in
        Soroca, a substantial share of the respondents stressed that they wish more resources could be
        invested inwastewater treatment, confirming the value that the population assigns to the proposed
        project;

        Different technical alternatives were then analyzed to find the lowest cost option of collecting,
        treating and safely disposing of the wastewater from the project.           In particular, the project
        attempts to minimize the costs of collecting and treating wastewater by analyzing alternatives for
        phasing of collection and treatment capacity, rehabilitating and upgrading existing facilities and
        introducing low cost treatment. Such calculations exclude non-economic costs such as taxes,
        subsidies and other transfer payments. The cost comparison was done in constant prices that
        exclude the effect of general price inflation;


    0   The annual costs in economic terms of each alternative were then made comparable by
        discounting them by the opportunity cost of capital, producing a present-value sum of the
        economic costs;


    0   The alternative with the lowest present value sum was then selected. In the particular case, the
        least-cost alternative is immediately apparent since the selected technology of "Constructed
        Wetlands" has both the lowest investment and the lowest operations and maintenance costs of the
        next best alternative.

40.     Additionally, an environmental cost effectiveness analysis is possible on the basis of the
monitoring indicators such as the annual reduction of nutrient discharges of nitrogen and phosphorus, the
average operating cost of the process to reduce nutrients, the annual reduction of BOD discharges, and the
average operating cost of the BOD reduction.            The exploration of low cost treatment options is
particularly relevant becauseof the potential for lowering operating costs, and inparticular energy costs.

Financial

41.     The Soroca Apa Canal has been the beneficiary of a USAID Grant (under the auspices o f the
Pilot Project) which funded an analysis by the Urban Institute and proposed measures for strengthening
the Apa Canal's financial performance. The analysis covers the 2001-2003 period and projected the
financial situation of the Soroca Apa Canal for the 2005-2008 period. The analysis concluded that the
Apa Canal had incurred negative operating results due to delayed tariff increases and important water
losses that exceeded 60% of production. However, cash shortfalls have been met from the budget of the
Soroca. The PWSSP-financed rehabilitation and meter installation is now expected to improve the
financial situation of the Apa Canal.         Furthermore, Section 4.03 under the Development Credit
Agreement for the PWSSP (Credit number 3763 MD) specifies that "the Borrower shall take all measures
necessary to ensue that each Participating Apa Canal (includingthe Soroca Apa Canal) shall maintain in
the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2006, a ratio of total operating expenses to total operating
revenues not higher than  loo%,   decreasing to 90% by the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2007, and,
thereafter, maintain said ratio for each of its fiscal years." The latest available situation indicates that the
SorocaApa Canal has a working ratio of about 1.12, i.e. is not instrict compliance with this covenant. As
part of negotiations for the GEF grant agreement, this financial covenant will be extended but allow for
contributions from the Soroca municipal budget to be accounted as revenue in accordance with the World
Bank Water Sector Board of financial sustainability. With this modified financial covenant, the Soroca
Apa Canal could comply with a working ratio of 1.OO which would ensure that sufficient revenue will be
made available for operating and maintaining the wastewater treatment works that the GEF grant will
finance.

 B.       Technical

 42.      This project would address an issue of importance to Moldova: improving wastewater
 management and treatment, inter alia to address transboundary river pollution. This would complement
 the ongoing activities of the Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation Project and would reduce Black Sea
 nutrientloads.

 43.      At the present time, most wastewater is discharged into rivers with little or no treatment. Out of
 the one hundred existing treatment plants, only four are functioning satisfactorily and as a consequence
 most effluents do not comply with discharge standards. None of the existing plants are designed to
 reduce nutrient loads. This fact indicates the scope for replicating the technology of the proposed Soroca
 low-cost wastewater treatment technology. The cost of improving the situation nation-wide i s high and
 given the tight budget situation, amelioration progress i s slow. As the supply of potable water improves,
 awareness for the need to protect the environment i s rising.

 44.      The Soroca Municipality is located on the west bank of the Nistru River facing Ukraine on the
 east bank of the river. When there was a common government on both sides of the river, Soroca's
 wastewater was sent to a treatment plant located on the river's east bank, which is now part of Ukraine.
 From 1980 until pipe failure in 1991, Soroca's wastewater was being pumped to the WWTP on the
 Ukrainian side through a steel pipe of 400 mm diameter and 6.3 km length. Construction began in 1996
 on a new pipeline crossing the Nistru River but construction was never completed because of its cost,
 substantial risks inherent in under river crossing pipeline and due to political uncertainties. Thus, the
 sewage treatment works on the Ukrainian side are no longer operable and Soroca's wastes are discharged,
 untreated, into the river. Instead the project would provide wastewater treatment and nutrient removal by
 constructing wetlands 4.5 hlometers outside Soroca. It would also rehabilitate the water supply network,
 sewers and sewage pumpingstations within the municipality and provide monitoring equipment.

45.       Based on the economic least-cost analysis the Soroca Apa Canal and ACTD have chosen
 Constructed Wetlands (CW) system' for wastewater treatment technology. This low-cost technology was
 developed duringthe past two decades and has provedparticularly favorable for small cities/communities,
where sufficient landis available. Additionally, a CW is within the capacity of Apa Canal staff to operate
after adequate training. Not least, it reduces overall operation cost compared to conventional activated
 sludge systems to about 10-20% while providing satisfactory nutrient removal.                     Since the cost of
operating an activated sludge system would have increased the present domestic water tariff by about
 170%, this was considered unacceptable, and thus CW offers a highly favorable alternative. The 10
hectares of land available for the new WWTP are more than sufficient to accommodate the new works
there. In sum, the proposed treatment system with CW i s well adapted to the conditions in Soroca, and
could develop to an exemplary model for future wastewater treatment in many other small cities
throughout Moldova.




1  CW is a system. where wastewater - after priormechanical treatment - filters through about 0.5    -1.O mo f
planted, constructedsoil layer. While passingthis layer it is cleanedby a wide range ofmicroorganismsthat
developandmultiplyunder these conditions. The treated wastewater is collected underneath, and then discharged
into the recipient liver. The proposedCW would be two-stage system, which is superior than one stage system in
terms ofnitrogen removal and the landrequirement.The proposedarearequirementis about 5.5 haincluding 25%
of additional area for mechanicalpre-treatment,access road, operationalbuilding, etc. CWs are littlemechanized,
needvery little electric energy, and they are robust, yet still highly effective with regardto removalo forganicsand
nutrients. Public acceptanceis generallyhigh, since seen from outside CWs give a rather "green" impression,which
i s inno way reminiscentof any possibly badreputationthat wastewater treatmentmight be associatedwith.



                                                           18

46.       The sewer systemin Soroca is about 40 years old and received little or no maintenance for many
years. Wastewater concentrations are found to be low. Consequently, there i s substantial groundwater
infiltration into the sewers at present, which renders any pumpingand treatment unnecessarily expensive.
Several sections of the sewer system are near collapse. About 40% of Soroca's population is still not
sewered and require investment into new sewer lines. To address these pressing issues, a two-stage
approach i s agreed:

      Urgent rehabilitationmeasures, as suggestedby the SorocaApa Canal. These measures improvejust
      some of the most apparently damaged elements of the present sewerage. Much of the damage i s
      apparent to the public, notjust to Apa Canal staff. Hence, these measures are not only beneficial as
      such, but also help foster the public awareness of the ongoing activities.
0     Rehabilitation of sewer network. Under this item, a more systematic approach would be adopted: (i)
      development of a sewer database and hydraulic sewer model; (ii)priority ranlung of
      rehabilitatiordextension measures; and (iii)implementation according to assigned priorities. These
      activities thus show the way forward, and start off with some of the most urgent ones.

C.        Fiduciary

Procurement:

47.       The grant will be implemented by the PIU under the overall responsibility of ACTD. The PIU
would be responsible for carrying out all procurement activities in a manner consistent with WB
procurement guidelines.

48.      The nature of the grant i s such that it requires close coordination among PIU, ACTD and Soroca
Apa Canal.       The PIU procurement specialist has good experience in carrying out Bank-financed
procurement. However, as a result of the findings and recommendations of the Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR), dated June 2003, the PIU is operating in a highrisk country in respect of its
public procurement system. In light of these shortcomings, the procurement risk for these implementing
agencies i s considered "medium".       This medium risk will be mitigated through: (i)Prior Review -
intensive and close supervision and major works contracts will be prior reviewed; (ii) Review - one
                                                                                         Post
in six contracts will be post reviewed; (iii)    Complaints - all complaints by bidders will be diligently
addressedand monitored inconsultation with Regional Procurement Manager's office; (iv) Publication of
Advertisement and Contracts - all publications of advertisement and contracts, including results of awards,
will be monitoredas per the Bank's Procurement Guidelines; (v) Training project launch workshop and
                                                                              -
intensive procurement training for PIU and ACTD staff will be conducted periodically; (vi) Procurement
Plan and Thresholds - the procurement plan will determine the prior and post review thresholds including
packaging of contracts based on construction capacity in Moldova; (vii) Fiduciary Staff - if required,
additional staff (Procurement Specialist) will be hiredto assist the PIUto implement the project; and (viii)
Contractors, Suppliers and Consultants Payment - payment to contractors, suppliers and consultants will
be monitoredto ensure timely payment.

Financial Management

49.      The financial managementfunctions of the Project will be handled by the PIU, and the PIU will
be responsible for the flow of funds, accounting, reportingand auditing of the Project.

50.      The financial management arrangements of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) have been
reviewed periodically as part of previous project supervisions for PWSSP and have been found between
marginally satisfactory to satisfactory. An assessment of the financial management arrangements for the
Environmental Infrastructure Project was undertaken in January 2007.            The financial management



                                                       19

arrangementsof the Project are acceptableto the Bank, as they meet the minimumfiduciary requirements.
The overall FM riskfor the project is moderate.

51.      The 2003 Country Financial Management Accountability Assessment (CFAA) in Moldova
concludes that the financial accountability framework in Moldova is weak and requires substantial
strengthening. The key weaknesses identified include: (a) budget framework process is fragmented, (b)
inefficient cash management, (c) weak internal control and internal audit, and (d) inadequate external
audits.

52.      Specific procedures are developed by the project to secure proper financial accountability of this
project and to minimize project financial management risks; these procedures are detailed in Annex 7.
Additional financial management arrangements in the project will include the audit of project financial
statements by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank.

53.      The banking sector in Moldova is relatively weak. However, the PIU will open the project's
Designated Account in a commercial bank, acceptable to the Bank, whose financial status and statements
are reviewed on an ongoingbasis by the Bank.

D.       Social

54.      The project would build upon previous municipal experience with community involvement in
sector improvements and involve mechanisms established under the linked PWSSP, which included the
strengthening of the Customer Service Office (CSO) of the Apa Canal. Consultation with community
groups by the CSO has already been used to (i)    represent user perspectives, and (ii)identify investment
priorities. The CSO in collaboration with community groups would play a role in public education
campaigns, usinga variety of media and such other means as schools, healthclinics and newspapers.

55.      There are no land acquisition or resettlement issues but there is a land transfer. The former
pressure sewer pipeline that runs from the pumping station to the treatment site will be replaced. The
pipe runs under an existing access road, and the right of way is secured by the municipality. The route
runs through an open area, and no structures or trees are located near the alignment. The now-abandoned
sewerage pond system was located on 10 hectares of land. This is sufficient space for the proposed
receiving station and the constructed wetlands. The land is to be transferred from Egoreni Commune to
Soroca Municipality based on a Local Council Decision issued by the Egoreni Commune on March 30,
2007. This area is owned by Egoreni Commune and it is open landwith no squatters and no informal use.

56.      Social development outcomes would be monitored through the continuous use of the instruments
used during identification and appraisal. The results of the initial assessments would be reviewed during
supervision missions to determine key elements to be tracked duringthe course of project implementation
to indicate outcomes and user satisfaction. Focus groups would be the primary survey instrument. The
monitoring process would take place annually and if budget permits, then biannually. Sustainability o f
the processwould bepromotedthrough the continuation of the processby the CSO.

57.      The social assessment conducted under the PWSSP has also helped to confirm the key
stakeholders whose participation in the proposed project is essential. The Agency for Construction and
Territorial Development, the Ministry of Environmentand Natural Resources, the Ministry of Health, and
the Ministry of Agriculture are the four major Government stakeholders.              The local municipal
administration, the Apa Canal, and the NGOs serving as surrogate water user associations constitute the
primary local stakeholders.




                                                   20

58.      Extensive public consultation, including public polls and hearings in conjunction with the
preparation of the Environmental Assessment for the proposed project, has provided additional validation
of the results initiated under the PWSSP and confirmed continuing community and stakeholder values
and concerns.       The target groups included the local administration in Soroca, public health and
environmental inspectors, water consumers living in different parts of the municipality, representativesof
ethnic communities including Roma communities, NGO, and representatives of local business operators.
The findings indicated that most people had heard about the proposed project, felt it would significantly
benefit water quality in the Nistru, and would have a positive effect on the economic development of the
region as well as their personal well-being.

E.       Environment

Environmental Category: B

59.       The wastewater from Soroca Sewage was once treated at upriver ponds before being discharged
into the Nistru River. Some time ago, this approach was discontinued and sewage was piped across the
river for treatment down river in Ukraine. This second approach has also been discontinued, and the raw,
untreated sewage is currently directly discharged into the river.

60.       The project would rehabilitate the existing pumps and sewage lines and install constructed
wetlands to treat the wastewater through a low-cost, robust technology. No negative impact is foreseen
that cannot be addressed by the mitigation plans beingprepared under the EA and its associated EMP.
Except for minor disruption, which would be mitigated according to the EMP, during the rehabilitation
and construction at the former pond sites, the impact on natural habitats would be positive. It is not
expected that the natural habitats along the river banks will be disturbed. Recreational areas downstream
would benefit from the project as well.

61.      The long-term impacts of the project are clearly positive both in terms of local and global
benefits. Although the project would have no significant negative environmental effects, an EA with
EMP has been prepared by the government in collaboration with local consultants. All work would be
executed either within existing facilities or on the publicly held land formerly used for the treatment
ponds. Bidding documents would specify requirements for keeping work sites pollution-free, returning
sites to their original conditions and minimizing dust, noise and relatedwork nuisance.

62.       Since the city of Soroca i s of some historic note, the EA includes a provision for chance
archaeological finds for pipe rehabilitation.    The site for the receiving station and the constructed
wetlands is 4.5 kilometers from the city. The project would not affect indigenous people. No dams are in
the project scope.

EA and EMP

64.      The proposed project i s classified as environmental assessment category B in accordance with the
Bank's Operational Policies. The environmental impact of the project is mostly expected during the
construction stage of the proposed investments including rehabilitation of sewerage network and
constructed wetland facility. The EIA, includingan EMP, for the project has been carried out. The EIA
public consultation meeting held in the premises of the Mayor's Office in Soroca on June 6, 2006
discussed the overall project goal and the four possible treatment options applicable to Soroca WWTP.
About 25 people attended the meeting representing NGOs, local environmental agencies, academia and
local authorities but no major concerns were raised. Participants expressedtheir support for the proposed
project investments and assured of their constant participation during the project implementation. The
revised EIA report, including the final treatment option, has been publicly disclosed (in Romanian) at the
PIU office in Chisinau, and announced locally in the "Monitorul Oficial a1 Republicii Moldova'' on
February 23, 2007. Furthermore, a brief public information session was held in Soroca on March 14,
2007 to inform citizens and NGOs about the selectedconstructed wetland solution. The revised EIA has
been disclosed in Washington, DC on March 15, 2007. The final EMP will be revised once the detailed
design for the proposed constructed wetland facility is available.

International Waterways ExemDtion to OP/BP 7.50

65.      It has been assessed that the project falls within the exceptions to the notification requirement
under paragraph 7 (a) of the Policy. According to paragraph 7 of OP 7.50, there are exceptions to the
Bank's requirement that the other riparian states be notified of the project. According to paragraph 7(a) of
OP 7.50, the exception applies: "For any ongoing schemes, projects involving additions or alterations
that require rehabilitation, construction, or other changes that in the judgment of the Bank (i)                    would not
adversely change the quality or quantity of water flows to the other riparians; and (ii)would not be
adversely affected by other riparians' possible water use. This exception applies only to minor additions
or alterations to the ongoing scheme; it does not cover works and activities that would exceedthe original
scheme, change its nature, or so alter or expand its scope and extent as to make it appear a new or
different scheme.

66.      Incase of doubt regarding the extent to which a project meets the criteria of this exception, the
executive directors representing the riparians concerned are informed and given at least two months to
reply. Even if projects meet the criteria of this exception, the Bank tries to secure compliance with the
requirements o f any agreement or arrangement between the riparians."

67.      The project team has assessed the project components inthe context of and inrelation to OP 7.50.
The OP 7.50 applies to the project as the city of Soroca and is located on the Nistru River, which is an
international waterway as defined by paragraph l(a) of OP 7.50 and the project related to water and
sewerage. Since the project will have a significant positive impact on reducing sewage discharges, the
team requested an exemption and it was granted by the Bank's management on March 2, 2007. In

addition, because the preparation of the proposed GEF project has been done in close coordination with
the Ukraine authorities, there should be full acceptance of the project from the two riparian states. It
should be noted that all the signatories of the Black Sea Commission will be routinely informed of the
project since hiIoldova is a signatory of the Black Sea Commission.

G.      Policy Exception and Readiness

68.     The project does not require any exceptions other than the one highlightedunder paragraphs 65-
67 above from Bank policies and it meets criteria of readinessfor implementation.

COUNTRY AND SECTOR BACKGROUND

In2004, Moldova had a population of about 4.2 million people of whom some 0.6 million reside inthe
Transnistria part, on the East Bank of the river Nistru. The Cisnistria part, on the West Bank of the river
Nistru, has a GNP of US$ 2.5 billion and a per capita income of about US$ 720, mahng it the poorest
country inEurope. The country's population decreased slightly between 1990 and 2004 and a substantial
share of the economically active age groups are working abroad. Worker remittances explain strong
sustainedGDP growth since 2000, and the fact that the national poverty rate has been halved from around
70 percent in 2000 to about 35 percent in 2005. However, poverty remains high in rural areas where 54
percent of the populationlives.

The two main Moldovan Rivers, the Nistruin the east and the Prut, are both tributaries to the Black Sea.
In 1998, 56% of the raw water used for treatment and distribution came from the Nistrukver, 16% from
the Prut River. 8% from smaller rivers and the balance of 20% from wells.            Surface water quality
distinguishes between four classes: class I(good quality), class I1 (moderately polluted), class I11
(polluted), and class JY (very polluted). The water quality of the Nistru and Prut rivers is generally
classified as "moderately polluted" whereas it ranges from "polluted" to "very polluted" insmaller rivers.
The main quality problem of surface water i s the prevalence of nitrates and ammonium. The levels of
Biological Oxygen Demand(BOD) are also highand exceedEUguidelines.

STATUSOF THE SECTOR

WaterSuppltt:

There are 541 water supply systems in operation in Moldova. Out of these only 46% meet hygienic
requirements, and a mere 36% have the necessary authorizations to operate. The average Moldovan
water consumption norms are about 163 liters/cap/day (lcd) but the actual consumption is much lower due
to supply restrictions and low consumer income that also restrict consumption. In many rural areas,
particularly in the south of Moldova, this figure does not exceed 20 lcd. In the project town of Soroca,
the population consumes at rates below 40 lcd, proof of the poor water supply and the low household
incomes. The traditional source for drinking water supplied to homes in Moldova is groundwater.
According to data from the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, 70% of the overall population i s
supplied from groundwater sources and 30% is suppliedfrom surface water sources. Most drinhngwater
treatments have over-capacity nowadays resulting in inefficient operation and high levels of electric
power consumption per cubic meter supplied.

Water sources inmost cases are of unsatisfactory quality due to highconcentrations of nitrates, sulphates,
chlorine, fluorides, iron, minerals, color and hardness. In recent years the concentration o f nitrates has
risen.

Untreated water usually does not comply with GOST 2874-82 "Drinking water" requirements and WHO
requirements with regard to safe drinhng water quality. Hydraulic groundwater recharge is generally
considered sufficient. Interms of pollution level, the NistruRiver is a class 2 river - moderate pollution,
the Prut River upstream from Ungheniis a class 2, anddownstream- a class 3 river. The quality of water
extracted from the NistruRiver is changing, dependent on seasonal factors: rainwater is predominant in




                                                    24

summer and autumn, snow melting predominates inspring, and groundwater influence is predominant in
winter.

The main causes of surface water pollution are: (i)the absence, in many communities, of wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs), (ii)        the poor functioning of existing WWTPs, (iii)direct discharges o f
untreated domestic and industrial wastewater into recipient waters, (iv) accidental leaks from industries,
(v) agricultural runoff pollutedwith fertilizers, pesticides and other compounds, (vi) seepage from landfill
sites, and (vii) ploughing of land in water protection zones down to the water table. Researchcarried out
by the National Scientific and Practical Centre for Preventive Medicine shows a correlation between
specific human diseases and water quality, particularly in areas laclungcentralized water supply.

Water supply networks are mostly made of steel, cast iron or asbestos cement. These systems have often
been in operation for 35-40 years and need urgent rehabilitation. Water losses around 50% are common.
This is not only uneconomic, since unnecessary large amounts of water have to be treated / supplied, but
it also leads to infiltration of pollutedwater into the water supply system. Neither production, nor supply,
nor consumption of water is satisfactorily metered.

Seweruge and wustewutertreatmentplants fwWTPs):

Communal centralized sewerage systems exist in 74 urban areas and 126 rural communities.               The
installed capacity of WWTP systems equals 767,000 d / d . Total lengths of sewer lines equal 2,070 km.
The current real capacity of all wastewater treatment stations is 727,000 d / d , but the volume of
wastewater collected isjust 200,000 &/day.

Wastewater from individual households without sewage systems is mostly being discharged into septic
tanks. Subsequently some pollutants infiltrate into the soil, polluting groundwater. Emptying of septic
tanks is erratic, and sludge disposal / treatment usually does not meet sanitary standards.

Sewerage systems lag behind water supply systems in terms of their development.            100 wastewater
pumping stations are currently in operation, out of which at least three are damaged (in the towns of
Hincesti, Ungheniand Basarabeasca).

Many of the under-lying assumptions for design in the Former Soviet Union (FSU) have since changed
such as per capita consumption levels and energy prices. Hence, many sewer systems and WWTPs need
to be updated such as connected population numbers, wastewater production rates per capita, size and
location of economic zones, industries, and land development plans.

The existingWWTPs comprise two groups:

     0   Group 1-mechanical and biological treatment (43% of WWTPs); and

     0   Group 2   -  mechanical and biological treatment. Biological treatment of wastewater is usually by
         means of Trickling Filters (in 12% of all WWTPs) or Activated Sludge (in 88% of all WWTPs).

Following treatment, runoffi s sometimes chlorinated, contrary to environmentally best practice.

Even in those towns, where there are WWTPs, the treatment i s not up to discharge requirements. Only
four existing WWTPs operate satisfactorily, viz. in Balti, Glodeni, Drochia and Floresti. The general
requirement for all these works is only for carbon removal. Consequently, process schemes need to be
modernized and additional WWTPs to be constructed. But also existing inefficient installations such as
pumps, air blowers for aeration tanks, etc. require urgent replacement to reduce power consumption cost.
At presentelectricity accounts for an average34% of total expenditures.


                                                      25

The chemical composition of wastewater has changed, too, in the last decade, with 75% now being
domestic wastewater. In FSU industrial wastewaters dominated. The operation & maintenance (O&M)
of communal systems leaves much to be desired due to a low level of qualification of employees, lack of
financial resources and a lack of adequate control means. Many WWTPs suffer from frequent power
blackouts.

At present, operating revenue for water supply and sewage services does not cover cash O&M
expenditure leaving no funding for utilities to perform the necessary repair and maintenance work. As a
result, infrastructure is deteriorating rapidly.

In view of the unsatisfactory situation, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moldova,
requested, inthe letter dated October 9, 2006, the Bank's assistanceinhelping the Government update its
sector stratea.     Subsequently, the Agency for Construction and Territorial Development (ACTD)
organized a workshop on October 26, 2006 to allow a wide range of national stakeholders and
representatives from external assistance agencies to discuss the sector development strategy. The Bank
provided its comments on the government sector strategy inJanuary 2007 on which basis, the dialogue on
sector policy continues. One conclusion is that wastewater treatment is contingent on securing grant
financing of the rehabilitation or new construction. To date, no WWTP in Moldova is designed for
enhanced nutrient removal.        The proposed Soroca low-cost wastewater treatment pioneers nutrient
removal and could potentially prove significant in guiding the rehabilitation or replacement of existing
treatment plants.

The only active project inthe water supply and sanitation sector is the Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation
Project (PWSSP) that was approved in2003 and i s expected to be completed by December 3 1,2007. The
PWSSP finances physical rehabilitation of water supply systems in the five cities and towns of Balti,
Cahul, Orhei, Soroca, and Stefan Voda. The proposed Soroca GEF project will benefit from the PWSSP
inseveralmays:


    0   Effective implementation arrangements have been created and tested which will help speed up
        project implementation of the GEF project;
    0   The Borrower, the Soroca apa-canal, will already have experienced all challengesassociatedwith
        monitoring and evaluation, reporting requirements, and the Bank`s safeguardpolicies;
     0  The Soroca apa-canalwill have gained infinancial sustainability under the PWSSP;
     0  The standards for operations and maintenance have improved as a result of the PWSSP which
        will directly benefit the efficacy, efficiency and sustainability of the GEF-financed facilities; and
     0  The rehabilitation of a portion of the existing water supply and wastewater system, includingthe
        expansion of metering and the replacement of obsolete electro-mechanical equipment, has made
        both production and consumption more efficient which implies that the GEF-financed wastewater
        treatment can treat less water and therefore reduce capital investments.

The Development Objectives (DO) and Implementation Progress (IP) are both rated as "satisfactory" in
the latest Project Status Reports.

SOROCA WWTP

Soroca, on the border with Ukraine, is located on the banks of the Nistru River in North Moldova. The
municipally-owned Soroca Apa Canal, established in 2000, is responsible for water supply and
wastewater services. At present, it has a total of 113 staff, who operate 61 km water lines and 53 km
sewer lines. The operating surplus is nil and cannot support any major investment. Water is supplied to
98% of the population through 4,800 connections, whereas 63% of the population with water supply
connections has 3,000 sewerage connections. The 4,800 water connections correspond to about 9,000
individual service accounts, since a share of the population reside in multi-story buildings with multiple
apartments. Generally, the physical state of all installations i s dire, suffering from age, poor quality and
lack of re-investment.

At present, there is no wastewater treatment whatsoever and the raw sewage is discharged into the Nistru
River inthe front of the town's main tourist attraction, a medieval fortress built between the 14thand 16th
century. The former Soroca WWTP, built in Soviet times in 1980, is located on the Ukrainian side of the
Nistru River. From 1980 until the pipeline broke down in 1991, the Soroca wastewater was being
pumpedto the WWTP through a steel pipe of 400 mmdiameter and 6.3 kmlength. In 1996, construction
began on a new river crossing pipeline but it was never completed because of its cost, substantial risks
inherent in under river crossing pipeline and due to political uncertainties. Thus, the sewage treatment
works on the Ukrainian side are no longer operable and Soroca's wastewater is discharged, untreated, into
the river. Hence, a new site has been proposed to the North of Soroca, where a new WWTP should be
constructed. There are no suitable nearby sites downstream of Soroca on the Moldovan side because the
river banks are steep on the Moldovan side (incontrast to the flat Ukrainian side).

The ACTD carried out a feasibility study of three alternatives: Activated Sludge (AS), Extended Aeration
(EA) and Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR). Out of the three options, SBR is too sophisticated and
involves too many risks for failure under the specific environment in Soroca. The other two options
studied, AS or EA, are feasible but will pose operational challenges for the Apa Canal staff whose slull
level i s limited. More serious, the level of operations and maintenance costs of either treatment method i s
about US$ 300,000 annually which would require a sewage treatment surcharge of MDL 11 per cubic
meter of wastewater, or about US$ 0.85 per m3. This surcharge would be around 125% of the average
water tariff at present and about 170% of the domestic water tariff. The surcharge i s so high that it i s
unlikely that the population would be willing to pay it, which in turn would make the financial and
operational sustainability moot.

Under the circumstances, the Apa Canal and the ACTD have opted for low cost appropriate technologies
to reduce BOD, SS and nutrient loads. The most suitable alternative was found to be "constructed
wetlands" that are non-mechanized, robust and within the capacity of the Apa Canal staff to operate,
conditional on additional training being provided. The site has an area of 10 hectares which is ample for
the area necessary for effective treatment through wetlands. It is estimated that the presently sewered
population of 17,000 would require 5.5 hectares of constructed wetlands and the remaining area of 4.5
hectares provide additional space to accommodate the mechanized pre-treatment, access roads, and the
industrial and future domestic wastewater. Industrial wastewater amounts to about 30% of the domestic
wastewater andhas mainly organic loads since the main industry is a fruit canning plant.

SewerageSystem

The sewerage system in Soroca is about 40 years old and received little or no maintenance for many
years. Wastewater concentrations are found to be low. Consequently, there is substantial groundwater
infiltration into the sewers at present, which renders any pumpingand treatment unnecessarily expensive.
Several sections of the sewer system are near collapse. About 40% of Soroca population is still not
sewered and require investment into new sewer lines.

Urgent rehubilitation measures

Given these dire conditions, APA-Canal has produced a priority list for "urgent rehabilitation" of the
sewer system. It lists about 2 km of sewer lines and an additional number of about 40 manholes where
rehabilitation would be provided immediately. This component will be financed under the Pilot Water
Supply and Sanitation Project and will be completed by the end of 2007.

Rehabilitation of sewer network

With the above urgent rehabilitation, the sewer system as a whole will be by no means in a substantially
improved condition. To tackle this complicated and very comprehensive issue, the first thing to develop
is a sewer database. Sucha database should contain:


0     basic information for each individual sewer section (pipe material, diameter, age, etc.)
0     informationon the physical state of selectedsewer sections; and
0     surveying data (level of manhole bottoms, street level, exact position)

Once this information is known, a hydraulic model can be developed and reliable decisions be taken on
the priority of subsequentmeasures.

Engineering Consultant and TA

This component would support: (i)Engineering services for WWTP and sewer network design,
procurement, supervision support; and a six months' operational assistance for WWTP; and (ii)
Feasibility studies for 10 towns and pre-feasibility studies for an additional 5 towns, including replication
of constructed wetland system inthe studies.

Disseminatiopi undReulication ComDonent

This component targets the dissemination of experience and knowledge obtained from operation of the
new Soroca WWTP to be constructed. This is considered of particular importance due to the pioneering
character of this GEF project, which could prove exemplary to many other WWTPs inMoldova. Hence,
to this purpose, the new operation building at the WWTP will include facilities suited for seminars and
workshops. The annual water monitoring workshops would expand in scope and participation with the
growing database and with the progress of treatment of the Soroca wastewater. The first workshop in
year 3 would likely mainly have Moldovan participation and would target participants from all those
communities in Moldova that have or are contemplating wastewater treatment plants.              The second
workshop in year 4 is planned for Moldovan and Ukrainian participation and possibly wider international
participationiiicoordination with the Istanbul commission of the GEF Black Sea Convention.

Soroca Apa Canal:

The Soroca Apa Canal was established in 2000. It is a registered, legal entity, and owned to 100%by the
Soroca Municipality. It is in charge of water supply and wastewater collection and treatment in the
Municipality of Soroca. The Apa Canal has a total of 113 staff as shown in the below table. The PIU
will coordinate with the Director and the chief engineer duringthe project implementation. The operation
and maintenance of the constructed wetlands will be minor and the present Apa Canal staffwill be able to
operate it as part of their other duties, subject to receiving initial training and supervision by the
contractor andby the engineering consultant.

The monitoring and evaluation of outcomes an, results during implementation woul follow stanurd
Bank practice and be carried out in conjunction with the Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation Project. The
Project Implementation Unit would collect and present data and reports for yearly review by Bank
supervision missions. Discussions during supervision related to institutional capacity building, financial
viability, technical reviews and site visits would provide an effective means of monitoringprogress

1.      Country Issues.

The 2003 Country Financial Management Accountability Assessment (CFAA) in Moldova concludes that
the financial accountability framework in Moldova i s weak and requires substantial strengthening. The
key weaknesses identified include: (a) budget framework process is fragmented, (b) inefficient cash
management, (c) weak internal control and internal audit, and (d) inadequate external audits. It would be
inappropriate for the Bank to place a blanket reliance on that framework for the purposes o f satisfying the
Bank's fiduciary financial management requirements. Reliance on any particular aspect o f the country's
financial management framework would need to be established on a case-by-case basis with reference to
the specific financial management arrangements o f the institutions involved.

The overall conclusion o f the country Fiduciary Risk Assessment was that Moldova rated a high risk.
Although the position may have improved considerably, but any change in the risk assessment i s
conditional on the process reforms that are being introduced and are continued to be implemented
effectively and efficiently, and that the improved signs in tackling corruption are supported by hard
evidence.

2.      Summary of FMassessment.

The financial management assessment o f the project was performed based on agreement that financial
management functions, including accounting, reporting, auditing, internal controls will be performed by
the PIU, subordinated to the Agency for Construction and Territory Development (ACTD), which i s
currently implementingthe WSSP.

The FM arrangements for the project meet the Bank's minimum requirements. The overall financial
management riskfor the Project i s moderate.

Risk of Misuse of Funds andMitigation Measures

The following measures are incorporated inthe project design to minimize the riskof misuse of funds:
    .
        Financ?al Management Manual. The Project will closely follow the procedures and controls
        prescribedin the Financial Management Manual. The Manual shall not be amended or waived
    .   without prior approval of the Bank.

    .   Inter7zid Controls. The internal controls procedures are detailed in the section Internal Controls
        and Internal Audit below.

    .   Prior Review ofProcurement. A low threshold will initially be set for the Bank's prior review of
        procurement decisions by the Borrower.
                                      The financial audit will cover annual project accounts and entity
    .   Annrrd Financial Audit.
        financial statements

    .   Regulur reporting, The project will prepare and submit to the Bank quarterly financial reports -
        IFRs.
        Intensirle Supervision by the World Bank. Overall supervision, including financial management
        supervision, will be undertaken by Bank staff on a regular basis.

Anti-CorruptionMeasures

Ingeneral, corruptionis acknowledged as an issue inthe public sector inMoldova. Therefore, increased
spending in utilities sector potentially opens up opportunities, and this risk must be countered by specific
anticorruption measures to be implemented under the project. The risk mitigation measures would
includethe measures outlined inthis section and section on Internal Controls and Internal Audit below.

4.      Strengths and weaknesses

The significant strengths that provide a basis of reliance on the project financial management system
include: (i)the experience of PIU in implementing Bank-financed projects and satisfying Bank financial
management requirements; and (ii)     centralized financial management arrangements and simplified cash
flow.

5.      Sorocu Apa-Canal

The municipally owned Soroca Apa Canal, established in 2000, is responsible for water supply and
wastewater services. At present it has a total of 113 staff, who operate 61 km water lines and 53 km
sewer lines. Water is supplied to 98% of the population through 4,800 connections, whereas 63% of the
population nith water supply connections are sewered through 3,000 sewerage connections. The 4,800
water connections correspond to about 9,000 individual service accounts, since a share of the population
reside inmulti-story buildingswith multiple apartments.

The operating surplus is nil and cannot support any major investment.

There are the following sources of revenues of Soroca Apa Canal: revenues from water supply (for
services provided to entities and individuals) and revenues from sewerage services (to entities and
individuals). In 2005 Revenues were MDL 4.2 million (US$ 0.33 million at the average exchange rate)
and Cost of sales MDL 3.7 million (US$ 0.29 mln.) and gross profit of MDL 0.52 mln. (US$ 0.04 million
at the average exchange rate). In 2004 sales did not cover cost of sales resulting to a gross loss of MDL
1.06 million (US$0.09 million at the average exchange rate). Revenues from water supply represented
35%, and from sewerage services 65%. The largest part of revenues is generated from sewerage services



                                                     39

provided to individuals - 49%. The largest part of cost of sales is fuel and energy (42% in2005 and 34%
in2004).

The net profit figure in 2005 was MDL 1.05 million (US$ 0.08 million at the average exchange rate),
while in 2004 there was a net loss of MDL 2.3 million (US$ 0.19 million at the average exchange rate).
The major costs element which caused shift from gross loss in2004 to gross profit in2005 was personnel
costs was reducedby 40% in 2005 comparing to 2004. Another factor that contributed to the shift was
      -
reversal of previously recorded payable of MDL 1.7 million (US$ 0.14 million at the average exchange
rate) as a result of court's decision.

6.       Implementing entity

The PIU was established in 2003 as implementing unit, created specifically to implement the PWSSP.
The PIU is subordinated to the Agency for Construction and Territory Development (ACTD). The PIU is
responsible for implementationand is capable to handle all fiduciary aspects of the project.

The risk associated with implementing entity is moderate, due to the sufficient experience in
implementation of the Bank-financed projects.

7.       Staffing

The PIU is headed by the PIU Director, and financial staff includes a Financial Specialist and an
accountantcashier (part-time). Although the Financial Specialist and the accountant cashier are relatively
new, the PIU Director i s able to ensure continuity in accounting and financial management of the project,
due to her past extensive experience infinancial managementof Bank-financed projects.

Implementation of additional project, Environmental Infrastructure Project, will not substantially increase
the work load of the existing staff, as the major activities for this Project will commence after completion
of major activities for PWSSP.

The riskassociatedwith staffing is assessedas moderate.

8.       Budgetingand Planning

The PIU will prepare annual budgets for the Project based on procurement plan and disbursement profile
(approved by the Bank staff). The budget will be prepared by PIU, approved by head of PIU, then
submitted for review to the General Director of the ACTD and then for approval to the Ministry of
Finance. The budgetwill be annually revised according to the project implementationprocess and incase
of any major changes inthe procurement plan.

These budgets form the basis for allocating funds to project activities. The approved annual budget will
be entered into the accounting system and used for periodic comparison with actual results as part of the
interim reporting.

The riskassociatedwith planningand budgetingis assessedas moderate.

9.      Information Systems

The PIU has recently purchased and installed licensed 1-C accounting system, and has made necessary
modifications to the system to suit the needs of the BankProjects. It is envisaged that the Environmental
Infrastructure Project will use the new automated 1-C accounting and reporting system.

The riskassociatedwith planning and budgetingi s assessed as moderate.

10.     Accounting Policiesand Procedures.

The accounting books and records will maintained on a cash basis and project financial statements are
presented in United States dollars. PIU has instituted a set of appropriate accounting procedures and
internal controls includingauthorization and segregation of duties. Accounting policies and procedures of
the project are reflected inthe project Financial Manual, which will be used by PIU in implementation of
the Environmental Infrastructure Project.

Additional accounting policies that to be applied on the project (besides standardaccounting policies used
for Budget agencies) will includethe following major procedures:

  -   cash accounting as the basis for recordingtransactions;
  -   reporting should be done inUS dollars (reporting currency);
  -   consolidated IFRs should be prepared for the Project.

The risk associatedwith accounting policies and procedures is considered as moderate.

11.     Internal Controlsand ZnternalAudit.

PIU has documented inits Financial Management Manual the internal control mechanisms to be followed
in the application and use of funds and the implementation of the project. The Financial Management
Manual deals with financial management and administrative procedures. The Financial Management
Manual also deals with accounting and record-keeping, flow of funds, and reportingprocedures.

The Financial Management Manual reflects the structure of the agency, administrative arrangements, and
internal controlprocedures.

The internal control proceduresinclude the following:

    -   proper authorization of expenditures, including authorization of SOEs and withdrawal
        applications;
    -   control over transfer and acceptance of goods by authorization by technical specialist of
        compliance of received goods to the agreed specifications;
    -   maintenanceof automatedrecords and regular backup of the accounting records;
    -   safeguardof assets through maintenanceof register of equipment and annual stock takes;
    -   segregationof duties to avoid conflict of interest,
    -   regular reconciliation of bank account statements to project records, including through access to
        client-bank systemfor remote access to the bank;
    -   regular reconciliationof project records through on-line access to Client-connection;



                                                    41

    -   bank signing mandate(to include at least two signatories);
    -   regular reportingto ensureclose monitoring of project activities,

The PIU has no internal audit function, and none is considered necessary given the size of the
organization.

The riskassociatedwith internal controls and internal audit i s considered as moderate.

12.     Reporting and Monitoring.

The PIU will prepare the quarterly Interim Un-audited Financial Reports (IFRs), previously knows as
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) and submit them to the Bank within forty-five days following end
of each quarter. The IFRswill be prepared automatically from 1-C accounting and reporting system. PIU
has demonstrated inits previous project that it is able to report on project expenditures, however, the PIU
has once duringyear 2006 delayed submission of the FMRs.

The indicative forms of IFRs havebeenincluded inthe Financial Management Manual usedby PIU.

The riskassociatedwith reporting and monitoring is assessedas moderate.

13.     Externul Audit.

No significant issues have arisen in the audits of previous Bank-financed project implemented by PIU.
PIU's previous Project auditing arrangements and findings are satisfactory to the Bank and it has thus
been agreed that similar audit arrangements will be adopted for the Environmental Infrastructure Project,
where Project financial statements will include Project sources and uses of funds, SOEs and Designated
Account.

In addition, audit of financial statements of Soroca Apa Canal entity will be carried out on an annual
basis. The financial statement of Soroca Apa Canal has been audited by independent auditors during
implementation of PWSSP. Certain weaknesses have been identified in accounting and internal controls
of the entity. The PIU shall continue monitoringprogress of Soroca Apa Canal towards strengtheningthe
accounting and reporting framework of the entity.

The audit of the project and entity financial statements will be conducted by independent private auditors
acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and the Bank
guidelines on auditing and financial reporting, on terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. The annual
audited project and entity financial statements will be provided to the Bank within six months of the end
of each fiscal year and also at the closing of the project.

The contract for the audit awarded duringthe first year of project implementation and thereafter extended
from year-to-year with the same auditor, subject to satisfactory performance. The cost of the audit will be
financed from the proceeds of the grant.

The following chart identifies the audit reports that will be required to be submitted by the project
implementation agency together with the due dates for submission.

14.      Funds Flow and DisbursementArrangements

The MOF, as recipient, will control all fund flows. The PIU will open and manage a Designated Account
(DA) specifically for this project in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. Project funds will flow
from the Bank, either via a single Designated Account, which will be replenished monthly on the basis o f
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) and or full documentation. Bank`s traditional procedures including
reimbursement, direct payment and Special Commitment methods would be used.                      Supporting
documentation for SOEs, including completion reports and certificates, will be retained by the Borrower
and made available to the Bank during project supervision. All disbursements would be made on the
basis o f full documentation for (a) contracts for goods costing more than the equivalent o f US$ 100,000
each; (b) contracts for works costing more than the equivalent o f US$ 100,000 each; and (c) services
under contracts o f more than the equivalent o f US$ 100,000 for each consulting firm and more than the
equivalent o f US$50,000 each for individual consultants. Disbursements below these thresholds and for
expenditures against incremental operating costs would be made according to certified Statement o f
Expenditure (SOEs).

This documentation would be retained by the MOF through the PIU for at least one year after receipt by
the IDA o f the audit report for the year inwhich the last disbursement was made.

The risk associated with funds flow and disbursement i s considered as moderate.

15.     SupelvisionPlan.

As part of its project supervision missions, IDA will conduct risk-based financial management
supervisions, at appropriate intervals.    During project implementation, the Bank will supervise the
project's financial management arrangements in the following ways: (a) review the project's quarterly
FMRs as well as the project's annual audited financial statements and auditor's management letter and
remedial actions recommended in the auditor's Management Letters; and (b) during the Bank's on-site
supervision missions, review the following key areas (i)project accounting and internal control systems;
(ii)budgeting arrangements; (iii) disbursement management and financial flows; and (iv) any incidences
of corrupt practices involving project resources. As required, a Bank-accredited Financial Management
Specialist will assist inthe supervision process.

                               Annex 8: ProcurementArrangements
              MOLDOVA: ENVIRONMENTALINFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT

A. General

Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 and revised in October
2006, and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and revised in October 2006 and the provisions stipulated inthe Legal Agreement.

The various items under different expenditure categories are described in general below. For each
contract to be financed by the Grant, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods,
the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed
between the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at
least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and the improvements in
institutional capacity.

A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published in March 2007 in the United Nations
Development Business (UNDB) and dgMarket. The GPN will give a description of the works and
consulting services contracts to be procuredunder the project and will invite all potential contractors and
consultants to express interest and request additional information from the implementing agency.
Specific Procurement Notices (SPNs) for International Competitive Bidding(ICB) procurement packages
and Expression of Interest (EOI) for consultingassignmentsestimated to cost US$200,000 equivalent per
contract will be published in UNDB (on-line), dgMarket and a nationalnewspaper of broad circulation as
the corresponding bid documents become available. In addition, the Procurement Plan (including all
formal updates), SPNs and EOIs for all contracts as well as results of contract awards will be published
on the external website of UNDB online and indgMarket.

The PIU will follow the Bank's anti-corruption measures and will not engage services of firms and
individuals debarred by the Bank.        The listing of debarred firms and individuals is located at:
http://w    .worldbank.org/html/opr/procure/debarr.html.

Procurement of Works: Works procured under this project would consist of rehabilitation of waste
water system and the construction of waste water treatment facility of the municipalities of Soroca. This
will include the rehabilitation of pumping sets and sewer networks and laying of pressure pipelines.
Small size contract will be procured through Minor Works (shopping), by obtaining a minimumof three
quotations and National Competitive Biddingby using sample bidding documents or invitation to quote.
Suitable consulting firm will be selected for design and supervise the rehabilitation works. Procurement
of a large contract for the rehabilitation of sewer network will follow the World Bank's International
Competitive Bidding(ICB) procedures. Biddingdocumentation will be based upon the Bank's Standard
BiddingDocuments (SBD) for Works (May 2005 edition). The Domestic Preference clause will not be
applied inthe evaluation of bids. Contracts for civil works will be subject to screening for environmental
impact by the responsible entity. All biddingdocuments and contracts will include measures to minimize
or mitigate environmental damage.

Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under the grant would include monitoring and office
equipment, and office furniturethrough shopping. Shopping of goods under the specific threshold will be
carried out by comparing price quotation obtained from at least three suppliers.




                                                     45

Selection of consultants: Consultant services required under this project would include: (i)   engineering
consultant for WWTP feasibility /pre-feasibility studies and design procurement documents and
supervision and monitoring rehabilitation works; (ii)developing communication strategy; and (iii)
associated training etc.    Consultant's services to be financed from the grant would be selected in
accordance with the Bank Guidelines issued in May 2004 and revised in October 2006, and for this
project, would include Quality and Cost Based Selections (QCBS), Selection based on Consultants
Qualifications (CQ) and Individual Consultants (IC). QCBS and CQ selection over US$lOO,OOO would
be advertised in Development Business (online version) and Gateway, and in local media (one newspaper
of national circulation or the official gazette, and an electronic portal of free access (Moldova SPA
website) for expressions of interest, from which a short-list of six firms would be drawn. Individual
Consultants would be selected inaccordance with Part V of the Consultants Guidelines.

B. Assessment ofthe Agency's Capacity to ImplementProcurement

The project will be implementedby an establishedProject Implementation Unith d e dunderthe Pilot Water
Supply and Sanitation Project (PWSSP), under the overall responsibility of ACTD. The PIU consists of a
Project Director, Procurement Officer, WSS Engineer, Civil Engineer, an EnvironmentalSpecialist (part-
time), Financial Specialist, and Accountant Cashier (part-time). Inaddition a Steering Committee based
withinACTD would assist to provide policy guidance regarding project implementation.

An assessment of the capacity of the Implementing Agency to implement procurement actions for the
project has been carried out by Gurcharan Singh (Senior Procurement Specialist) in February 2007. The
assessment reviewed options for the organizational structure for implementing the project and the
interaction between the project's staff responsible for procurement and management. It was revealed that
the PIU staff does have enough capacity to add procurement under the proposed project to their existing
workload; they have good experience inconducting international procurement as they are dealing in other
Bank-fundedcredits. As a result of the findings and recommendations of the CPAR datedJune 2003 and
this assessment, the overall risk for procurement under the project i s determined to be "medium risk". At
the completioii of one year of implementation, the team will review the procurement capacity of the PIU
as well as the functioning of procurement with a view to making adjustments ifnecessary.

The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation of the project have been identified.
The project may face the following potential risks duringimplementation:

         (i) The public officials, who will be involved in project procurement through tender
                committees, and the public officials o f other related agencies at different levels of
                government, who will be involved in procurement, are not familiar with international
                procurement procedures, and may obstruct the procurement process; and

         (ii)   The bureaucratic system creates opportunities for informal interference in procurement
                process by senior officials. Furthermore, the past and the current experiences show that
                the formal involvement of PIU in the procurement process has resulted, and may result in
                moderate delays inprocurement and project implementation.

Based on the analysis made, the following actions are recommended to mitigate the above-mentioned
risks:

        The Bank will review and comment on the qualifications and experiences of tender committee
        members selectedby ACTD to ensure that only persons with appropriate qualifications and with
        no conilict of interest are selected. The PIU procurement staff and all potential members of




                                                     46

        tender committees will attend a one-day project procurement launch workshop that will be
        organized by the Bank staff immediately after the Grant Agreement is signed.


    0   A simple but detailed Revised Operational Manual will be prepared by the PIU prior to loan
        effectiveness. The manual will include procurement methods to be used inthe project along with
        their step by step explanation as well as the standard and sample documents to be used for each
        methodpertainingto this project;


    0   The PIU procurement specialists will work closely with the technical staff to foresee and reduce
        any potential delays inthe procurement process;


    0   The PIU team will establish and maintain a database of suppliers of the required goods, and
        consultants (firms and individuals, as well as an inventory of the available goods in the country).
        They will also prepare a database of historical prices so as to be able to prepare more precise and
        up-to-date contract estimates to be used meaninghlly as reference prices; and


    0   The Bank staff will review the efficiency of procurement under the project and the improvement
        in the procurement capacity of the PIU team after one year of the Grant effectiveness, and will
        make recommendations for further improvements, ifnecessary.

Training: Procurement training for PIUand ACTD staff and consultants will be conducted inaccordance
with a training program that will be submittedto the Bank for its agreementbefore implementation.

Operating Costs: The grant will finance the incremental operating costs of the team of experts to oversee
and manage the project. Operating costs will be incurred according to an annual budget satisfactory to the
Bank usingthe procedures to be described inthe Project Operational Manual.

Anti-Corruption Action Plan. The Bank intends to maintain customary oversight and will carry out
prior review of all major contracts according to the thresholds that will be regularly reviewed and adjusted
as neededin Procurement Plan. Initial set up thresholds are provided below inthis Annex. The following
measures will be carried out to mitigate corruption r i s k

        Training of Borrower's fiduciary staff starting from the project launch and periodically thereafter
        customized to procedure and methods that would be required in the next 12 month period.
        Following the project launch will include on-the-job training during supervision missions and
        regional training provided by the Regional Procurement Manager's office for the countries inthe
        region;

        Prior review: intensive and close supervision by Bank procurement accredited staff. In addition,
        all contract amendments will be subject to prior approval by the Bank;

        Publication of Advertisements and Contracts: all publications of advertisements and contract
        awards, including the results of the awards will be done in accordance with the Guidelines'
        requirements and published on external websites of free access of the UNDBand dgMarket;

        Debarred Firms: appropriate attention will be given to the need to ensure that debarred firms or
        individuals are not given opportunities to compete for Bank-financed contracts;

        Complaints: all complaints by bidders will be diligently addressed and monitored in consultation
        with the Bank;



                                                     47

         Evaluation Committee: the Bank will review and comment on qualifications and experience of
         proposed members of the Evaluationcommittee(s) with a view to avoid that unqualified or biased
         candidates are nominated. All members will be required to sign a disclosure form (sample will be
         includedinOperational Manual);

         Civil Works supervision: contractors carrying out rehabilitation works will be supervised by the
         civil engineer of the PIU;

         Monitoring of contract awards: all contracts are required to be signed within the validity of the
         bids/proposals and, in case of prior review contracts, promptly after the no-objection is issued.
         Procurement Plan format shall include information on actual dates (of no objections and award)
         and will be monitored for cases of delay which will be looked at on a case-by-case basis to
         identify the reasons;

         Monitoring Payments: all contracts shall include bank account information. The bank account
         shall be in the name of the same contractor/supplier/consultant that submitted the bid and
         awarded the contract. Payments to local contractors - suppliers -consultants shall be made in
         local currency only and paid to the accounts ofbanks located within the country;

         Monitoring of Payment vs. Physical progress: the IFRs will be customized to include a form to
         monitor physical progress compared to payment installments to avoid upfront loaded payments;
         and

         Timeliness of Payments: Payment to contractors, suppliers and consultants will be monitored
         through semi-annual interim un-audited financial reports (IFRs) to ensure timely payments.

C. Procurement Plan

The Borrower, with support from the Bank, has developed an initial procurement plan for project
implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods and timing. This plan has been
agreedbetween the Borrower and the Project Team on February 1, 2007. The Procurement Plan will be
updated inagreement with the Project Team, at least annually or more frequently as requiredto reflect the
actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.

D. Frequency ofProcurement Supervision

Inadditionto the prior review supervision to becarried out from Bank offices, the capacity assessment of
the ImplementingAgency has recommended that procurement supervision will be carried out every six
months.

                                Annex 9: EconomicandFinancialAnalysis
              MOLDOVA: ENVIRONMENTALINFRASTRUCTUREPROJECT


The economic analysis of the Soroca Environmental Infrastructure Project will be restricted to cost-
effectiveness and least cost analysis because the project benefits are such that they constitute
environmental improvements for which there is no market to value the net benefits.                      Under the
circumstances, the economic analysis has been limitedto: (a) least cost analysis, i.e. selecting the option
among several mutually exclusive alternatives that has the lowest economic costs; and (b) calculate on a
continuous basis the cost effectiveness as measured by the cost to remove each kg of BOD and nutrients
from the Nistru River.

The least cost analysis has been carried out and favors constructed wetlands the investment cost of which
i s US$ 3.0 million and the annual operational costs of which would be US$ 30,000.                  The next best
treatment method would be extended aeration where the investment and annual operating costs, would be
US$4.27 million and US$ 300,000, respectively.

The table below shows the investment costs for the four options studied and indicates that constructed
wetlands constitute the least-cost solution (costs inUS$ thousands of the year 2006):

Technology Option                 Investment       Annuitized             Annual          Total Cost

Extended aeration                4,270             560                    300             860

The constructed wetlands is assumed to have a technical life of 25 years whereas the other technologies are assumed
to have a useful life of 15 years. The discount rate used is 10%in constant prices.

No economic analysis has been carried out to justify the rehabilitationof the seweragenetwork. The need
for rehabilitation is obvious as illustratedby the fact that the blockage and breakage rates are many times
the levels prevailing in well maintained utilities. No precise data are available on breakage rates in the
Soroca sewerage system. However, as a comparison it could be mentioned that the breakage rate in the
water supply system is 7.2 pipe ruptures per km and year, equivalent to more than 30 times the level in
Western utilities.

Economic cost#'benefitanalysis of the proposed GEF project should also consider intangible benefits since
the absence of a market for the output of the project means that benefits cannot be valued reliably. Water
quality protectionwill primarily benefit those who live downstream from the primary sources of pollution
that the project will mitigate.        The downstream communities comprise Rezina, Ribnitsa, Dubasari,
Criuleni, Grigoriopol, Tighina, Vadul-lui-Voda, Tiraspol, Slobozia, Dnestrovsk, Olonesti, and Odessa
with a combined population of 1.4 million. The length of the NistruRiver downstream of Soroca is 550
km with high and low flow rates at Soroca of respectively 334 and 145 m 3 /second. Many of the
benefits, such as better quality of life, lowered risk of disease, and improved public health, are such that
monetary valuation is tenuous. They are therefore classified as intangible (although important) benefits.

                                          EnvironmentalIssues

Environmental Assessment:

An EnvironmentalAssessment (EA) has been completed for the rehabilitation and construction included
inthe project. The EA includes an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) covering the details of the
specific mitigation and monitoring measures for the works under the project. Mitigation would include
any minor social impact as well as physical impacts on the environment. Work under the project is
expectedto have a significant impact on nutrient reduction and have positive impact on water quality.

Monitoring the compliance of the implementation of the EMP is the responsibility of the Soroca
municipality and ACTD in coordination with the local environmental authorities (Regional inspectorate,
local environmental protection agency). Monitoring will focus on measuring compliance with pollution
standards and requirement of related permits (wastewater discharges, air quality, construction permit,
water permit, etc.) while mitigation measures will include actions to prevent environmental hazards such
as health and safety for the construction workers and the public; noise disturbance; restrictions to access;
dust - leading to adverse air quality; soil andor water pollution from fuel and oil, excavation of materials
and disposal of surplus soil/earth and other materials, degradation of historical and cultural sites, etc.

The EA has been locally consulted and disclosed and deposited in the World Bank InfoShop (March 15,
2007).

Natural Habitats:

No impact is expectedon natural habits along the river bankby the site, and the impact on naturalhabitats
downstream, is expectedto be positive once rehabilitationand construction is completed.

Pest Management: Not Applicable.

Involuntary Resettlement: There are no land acquisition or resettlement issues but there i s a land
transfer. The former pressure sewer pipeline that runs from the pumping station to the treatment site will
be replaced. The pipe runs under an existing access road, and the right of way is secured by the
municipality. The route runs through an open area, and no structures or trees are located near the
alignment. The now-abandoned sewerage pond system was located on 10 hectares of land. This is
sufficient space for the proposed receiving station and the constructed wetlands. The land is to be
transferred from Egoreni Commune to Soroca Municipality based on a Local Council Decision issued by
the Egoreni Commune on March 30, 2007. This area i s ownedby Egoreni Commune and it i s open land
with no squatters and no informal use.

Indigenous Peode: Not Applicable.

Forests: Not Applicable.

Safetv of Dams: Not Applicable.




                                                     51

Cultural Proeertv:

The site for the receiving station and the constructed wetlands i s four and a half kilometers from the
historic center of the city, and i s not believed to have ever been inhabited. Provision for chance finds,
however, has been included inthe EA and arrangementshave been discussedwith the Ministry of Culture
for handling any chancefinds.

Proiects in Diseuted Areas: Not Applicable.

Proiects on International Waterwavs:

OP 7.50 applies to any water project that involves "the use or potential pollution of international
waterways. It specifically exempts from the notification requirement "minor additions or alterations" to
existing schemes that "will not adversely change the quality or quantity of water flows to the other
riparians." Since by design the project seeks to improve the water quality of rivers in the region, it meets
this definition.  Reduced downstream flow of pollutants into the Black Sea would have positive
regionaUgloba1 implications.     On this basis, an exemption to the notification of riparians has been
requestedand approved by the office of the ECA RegionalVice President on March 2,2007.

                    Public Consultation, Social Survey, and Information Disclosure

Obiectives and Method:

The objectives of public consultation were to: i)provide information to water consumers and other key
stakeholders about the proposed improvement to the waste water treatment system, discuss the risks
associatedwith the alternative of continued discharge of polluted waters into the natural water bodies, and
provide an overview of the costs of the improvement; and ii)to involve the public into the
implementation of project. The consultation process included a public social survey and several focus
groups including local residentsand NGOs.

The main concerns indicated by stakeholders include: (i)environmentally friendly project management
and monitoring; (ii) strengthened inter-agency coordination; (iii) training needs; (iv) public information
and awareness requirements; and (v) high-quality construction.

Results of Social Survev:

Duringthe months of May and June 2006, almost 400 people participated in a social survey, representing
proportionally the town's population with regard to gender, regions, age and education. Generally, most
respondents had heard about the project (61%) before the survey and most (83%) indicated a positive
attitude toward the project. Expected positive benefits included the economic development of the region
(65%); the development of tourism in the region (81%); and positive impact on the conservation of
natural ecosystems (79%). Most felt the implementation of the works under the project would have little
or no impact on their everyday life (68%) and most (74%) were willing to accept any minor temporary
inconveniences.

Results of Public Consultation:

Public consultation was organized by advanced announcement of open meetings using the local T V
service. The meetings took place in the premises of Mayor's Office. These meetings paralleled the

conduct of the social survey. The expectations expressed by the participants included the following (in
order of priority, from the highest to the lowest):

        improvedhealth and life expectancy of the population;
        improvement of the river environment for both flora and fauna, including an increase in fish
        reserves inthe Nistru River;
        promotionof industrial development and the reduction of unemployment;
        improved agricultural conditions and irrigation;
        strengthening of the Government's ability to respect its obligations concerning the maintenance
        of trans-boundary river water quality;
        improvedconditions for tourism and recreation;
        improvedconditions for river eco-system for future generations (ethno-cultural aspect); and
        minimization of the inconveniences for population duringthe construction.

Disclosure:

The draft EA, preparedby ECO-TIRAS for the ACTD, was reviewed and was submittedto the Infoshop
on February 16, 2007 and made available to the public in Moldova in the local language. Another public
information session that announced the selected technical option (constructed wetland) proposed under
the project took place in Soroca on March 14, 2007. A revised final draft EIA has been made available in
local language at the PIU office inChisinau and disclosed at the Bank's Infoshopon March 15, 2007.

            MOLDOVA: ENVIRONMENTALINFRASTRUCTUREPROJECT


SECTOR DEVELOPMENTGOALSAND THE BASELINE

Sector Development Goals:

Under the "Program for the Development of Water Supply and Wastewater Services", which was
approved on 30 December 2005, the main sector development goals, which the GoM intends to achieve
by 2015, are: i)ensuring access for the population to good quality drinkingwater in quantities necessary
for water supply and other purposes, rational use of water; ii)environmental protection, protectionagainst
pollution and depletion of surface and ground water sources, appropriate management of investments,
improvement of services rendered to consumers, enhancing the economic efficiency of enterprises in the
water supply and sewage sector.

Moldova signed with Ukraine in 1995, calls on the signatories to cooperate injoint use and protection of
transboundary water courses and transnational lakes. This agreement followed the spirit and intent of the
Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercoursesand InternationalLakes adopted at
Helsinki in March 1992 and entered into force in October 1996. The second agreement signed by the
Government of Moldova was a Joint Memorandum of Understanding, dated April 1997, on cooperation
with Ukraine for development of a transnational water quality management plan for the Nistru River
Basin. In addition, Moldova is a member of the Danube River Commission, an unofficial member of the
Black Sea Commission and a party to many Black SealDanube cooperation agreements.

TheBaseline:

In the above sector context, the government approved the Water Supply and Wastewater Program
(Government Decree 1406 dated 30.12.2005) and committed to provide adequate financial resources to
meet the MDGtarget up to the year 2015.

The Baseline therefore takes reference to the GoM's Water Supply and Wastewater Program. It is
stressed that while environmental issues of local as well as trans-boundary relevance are high on the
GoM's agenda, the reality of its financial constraints forces the GoM to give priority to those measures
which exert the strongest and fastest positive impact on local population. The scope of other investments
and the speed, with which they can be addressed, will depend upon the amount of external financing that
the GoM i s able to obtain.

The GoM's plans and thus the Baseline for the present Incremental Cost Analysis - had foreseen a total
                  -
investment in Sorocafor modernization and development of water supply and sewerage systems of 33000
thousand MDL (=US$2500 thousand). Thereof a total = 28000 thousandMDL(= 2121 thousand US$)i s
supposedto be invested between 2006 and 2009, and another 5000 thousand MDL (= 379 thousand US$)
between 2010 and 2015. Out of the total investment 10000 thousand MDL (= 758 thousand US$)are
foreseen to be financed by state and local budgets. The latter figure is thus considered the baseline.

GEFENVIRONMENTALOBJECTIVESAND GEFALTERNATIVES
The overall project objective i s to reduce organic and nutrientemissions @hosphorus and nitrogen) from
municipal wastewater sources and to reduce the pollution in the Nistru River and subsequently in the
Black Sea.




                                                    59

Generally, such an approach makes perfect sense. On one hand increasing concentrations of organic
pollution and nutrients in surface and ground waters pose an increasing challenge to water treatment. The
whole Nistru catchment area, in one or another, i s dependent on these resources for water supply.
Increasingorganic and nutrientconcentrations thus cause:

    0    Additional cost for water treatment;

    0    Risks to public health;

    0    Eutrophication threats to surface water ecosystems, particularly in quiescent and stagnant water
         sections;

On the other hand nutrient emissions to the Black Sea are a main factor in the eutrophication of the
continental shelves at the north-western and western fringe of the Black Sea. The abundant introduction
of nutrients into the Black Sea began about inthe 1970s, and caused:

    0    Algal blooms;

    0    Oxygen depletion inthe Black Sea, particularly inbottom layers;

    0    Destruction of wetlands of global importance;

    0    Threats to marine habitats and ecosystems;

    0    Threats to seashore ecosystems;

    0    Negative effects on biodiversity;

    0    Dying-offof large fishpopulations with dire impacts on fish industry;


SDecific Obiective of the GEF NutrientRemovalProject in Moldova:

The specific objective i s a reduction of organic pollution and nutrient emissions from point sources in
Soroca. This requires the new construction of a WWTP designed for the removal of organics and
nutrients.

At present point sources constitute about slightly less than half of total P and N emissions in Moldova.
These figures were developed for the Danube catchment area, but given that the Danube catchment area
covers about 36% of Moldova's total area, the numbers can be considered applicable to Moldova as a
whole. The other half of Moldova's nutrientemissions has its origin inagricultural sources. Other nutrient
emissions than those from municipalpoint sources and agriculture do not play any major role inMoldova.

By tackling point sources of water pollution in Moldova, this does not only have national impacts, but
international benefits, too. Particular benefits are caused for the Ukraine, which i s using Nistru River
surface water for drinlungwater purposes as well. Needless to say, all states bordering the Black Sea can
only improve the Black Sea water quality by a mutual effort.


Impacts

The impacts of this project will be twofold:

    0   Improved water quality in the Nistru catchment area from which both Moldovan and Ukrainian
        cities andtowns draw water;

    0   Improved water quality in the Black Sea. Lower nutrient loads will reduce eutrophication in the
        delta and maritime zones. This again will have positive impacts on ecosystems, biodiversity and



                                                    60

          wetlands. All this i s not meant to be an end in itself, but it will eventually deliver positive
          economic impacts as well, e.g. if fish populations become more abundant again, and tourism i s
          revived.

Note: TN and TP removal observed in large scale CWs i s fluctuating considerably in the range o f 50 to
80%. Table 15.1 has selected the most conservative reduction. The figures applied for this table are
conservative and should be safely feasible with a proper design, according to recent literature3. Note
further that the average expected flow includes the relatively high levels o f intrusion o f groundwater and
surface water into the aging sewerage system.

Additionalih:: The measures suggested for the GEF project are additional to the Baseline. These
additional measures will complement planned activities. With the comparatively small funds available
for the Baseline, in the best o f cases some sewer rehabilitation and possibly low cost mechanical
treatment of the sewage would be possible to implement. Yet the Baseline is by no means sufficient
either for complete carbon removal or for nutrient removal.




* Given the assessment of currently known influent data, (i)an estimate is made for average influent BODSload =
1.OOO kg/d. All other influent load data is calculatedthereofby using typical ratios o fBOD5/ SS / TN / TP = 1/ 1,2
/ 0,2 / 0,05; (ii)Influent concentrationsare all calculated fiom average influent loads and flow; and (iii)Average
removal efficiencies are assumed according to experience for similar plants with regard to BODS and SS. TN
removal = 7046 is a design requirement according to EU standards. TP removal is estimated on the basis of bio-P
only, that is, without any use o f chemicals. If chemicals are used, P concentrations could easily be brought down to
the EUeffluent standardo f2,O mg/l,but such an operation cost is not consideredeconomicallyviable at present.

Positive econoritic impacts on fish industiv and tourism:

Avoidance of eutrophication and consequent increase in fish population can have a positive impact on the
economy. Presentfish populations are still down due to the negative impact of the past decades with bad
water quality. Likewise, tourism associated with a sound environment can generate a significant source
of income.

Overall financing and cost components:

The availability of significant allocations from GEF could well attract funding from other donors, which
could help finance similar projects. The GEF initiative and the grant provided by GEF are welcome and
provide the impulse, which will amplify the process of attracting investment, both foreign and local.

The total investment under the project is estimated at US$ 9.900 million. Thereof US$ 4.562 millionwill
be the GEF's contribution and US$5.338 million shall be financed by the GoM and IDA.

Scientific and technical soundness

The scientific and technical basis of the project is sound. It addresses the urgent and critical issue of
reducing sewage and wastewater pollution of the Nistru River. The project complements the current GEF
agricultural pollution control project to deliver reduction of nutrient pollution of the river which flows
into the Black Sea. The design of this project and builds on and reflects lessons and experience in many
similar projects ineffective low cost/low technology urban wastewater treatment.

The technologies for constructed wetlands are established and effective and appropriate to the staff
competence and current economic operational context of the Soroca Apa canal.

Given the estimate that less than 5% of wastewater treatment plants in Moldova are meeting effluent
standards, a demonstration plant and staff capacity buildingfor low cost water treatment are important in
the national context. The linkage to a government project to repair seriously degraded sewerage and
pumping infrastructure suggests that the project should achieve readily demonstrable outcomes that are
replicable in Moldova and insimilar situations elsewhere.

Global environment benefits and costs

The project will improve downstream water quality in the Nistrucatchment area. The NistruRiver flows
into the Black Sea. The project has good prospects of achieving its objectives and leading to further
national scaling-up delivering clear global benefits by addressinga component of nutrientpollution of the
Black Sea. The design of the project is thus linked to the GEF supported Strategic Action Plan for the
Protection and Rehabilitation of the Black Sea" (BSSAP).

The context o f GEF goals and guidelines

The project clearly addresses the objectives of the integrated land and water multiple focal area.     The
measures to reduce pollution to the Black Sea and Nistru Rver relate to Operational Program 8, the
Waterbody-based Operational Program. It addresses the objectives of providing a basis for achieving
sustainability, improving human and environmental health and economic outcomes and it applies the
guidelines with respectto incremental costs and the log-frame.

Regional Context

The project has highpriority in the context of human and environmental health of Moldova and Ukraine
because the Nistru catchment water body that i s heavily used in both countries for drinkmg water
production. The project is consistent with a Joint Memorandum of Understanding between Moldova and



                                                     66

Ukraine on transnational water quality management and with Moldova's role in several cooperative
agreementsrelating to the Black Sea and the Danube River.

Replicability

The project i s based on established methods and it as it achieves success and develops operational
capacities of apa canal staff it is likely to be replicated with a degree of urgency in order to enable
Moldova to meet its targets under the MilleniumDevelopment Goals.

Sustainability

This proposal addresses an urgent priority of restoration and technological catch-up in water treatment
after decades o f deterioration. The Government of Moldova is committed through national policy and
regional and international agreementsto sustain and extend water treatment capacity and performance.

Contribution to future strategies and policies

As discussedabove this project addresses core elements of national and regional policies and agreements.
The constructed wetland to treat the waste of the current sewered population of 22,000 will occupy just
over one third of the area o f the site for the treatment plant. There i s thus substantial capacity for
expansion and for establishment of further and more advanced treatment facilities as needs and capacities
develop.

Involvement of stakeholders

The project proposal reflects community support built through information, education and demonstration
of the needs for and benefits of water treatment. Apparent current willingness to pay to support water
quality benefits that accrue to downstream communities i s an important and attractive feature of the
proposal which also makes reasonable provision for further information dissemination, replication and
communication. This augurs well for sustainability and extension.

Riskassessments

Iamnotfamiliarwiththefieldoperatingsituationbuttheassessmentofmodestriskappearsreasonable
and perhaps cautious in the light of the reported government and community support for addressing the
issue of water treatment and water quality. Inote that the GEF Agricultural Pollution Control Project is
reported to be operating successfully. On this basis the risks seem to be reasonably discussed and I
concur with the assessments

Costs

Subject to the qualification above, the amounts and relativities of funding proposed for the various
components appear reasonable..

Conclusion

This is a soundly designed and important pilot project usingtried and appropriate technologies to address
an urgent public and environmental health issue in one of the poorest countries in Europe. It has
government and community support and presents acceptable levels of risk. Irecommend that it should
proceed.

The Bank team thanks Mr.Kenchington for his positive review of the project scope and design and agrees
with the reviewer especially on the importance of the project replicationpotentialgiven the large number
of non-functioningwastewater treatment plants, and the project innovationaspect since while the
technology is proven, it i s the first project of its kindinMoldova. Successful implementationof this
project would appeal donor community to increaseits assistance inthe water and wastewater sector in
near future.
