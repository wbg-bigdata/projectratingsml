1. THE ECONOMY
1.1   Jamaica, a small island economy in the Caribbean, has a total area of 11,000 km 2
and a population estimated at 2.5 million (1994 GNP per capita is US$1,420). About
45% of the land is used for agriculture. About 55% of the population, which increased by
0.9 percent in 1993, lives in urban areas. The country is well endowed with natural
resources, has a relatively well educated and skilled labor force, enjoys proximity to North
American markets, and has a developed financial system. It is wholly reliant on imported
oil for commercial energy consumption.
1.2   The economy is vulnerable to external factors such as foreign demand for
bauxite/alumina and tourism, its key exports, and the price of oil. The 1994 Country
Economic Memorandum' (CEM) presents a vision of how the economy can make the
transition from stabilization to growth and reduce poverty through economic
development. The following sections summarize the CEM findings.
A. Recent Economic Developments
1.3    After rapid development in the 60s, with growth rates on the order of 5%, fueled
by foreign investment in mining and tourism, as well as favorable terms of trade, the
economy declined and stagnated in the 70s and 80s. Many of the problems associated
with this situation can be traced to external shocks, excessive government intervention,
import-substitution policies and pervasive administrative controls. Expansion of the public
sector crowded out the private sector and increased the external debt which doubled
between 1980 and 1985, reaching US$4 billion.
1.4   In the second half of the 80s, economic policies were revised, the public sector
deficit was reduced, the import tariff system was restructured, many subsidies were
eliminated and some trade restrictions were lifted. From 1987 to 1993 GDP grew at an
average rate of 3%; however, growth has been below 2% in 1993 and 1994.
1.5   At present, Jamaica has a long-awaited breathing space in which to sustain and
complete the structural reforms necessary to restore growth. For the first time in almost a
decade, the country does not face a major financial crisis, macroeconomic imbalance, or
negative external shock.
B. CEM Policy Recommendations
1.6   The CEM emphasizes the following elements for achieving accelerated and
sustainable growth:
'Jamaica- A strategy for growth and poverty reduction. Country Economic Memorandum. Report No. 1 2702-JM,
April 12, 1994.



*  Government should focus its efforts on tasks that the private sector cannot
perform adequately and should withdraw from those which can better be
managed by private enterprise;
*  Overall economic policy should seek to assure macroeconomic stability in
order to attract investors;
*  Public expenditures should be targeted towards infrastructure, environmental
protection and human resource development;
*  Efforts to reduce crime and protect property should be increased in order for
market forces, and policies that work through them, to have their desired
effects; and
*  Economic goals should be achieved through the regulatory and incentive
structures rather than through budget and spending processes.
C. Government Economic Policy
1.7   Since 1989, the Government has embarked on an accelerated program of
economic reform involving liberalization, deregulation and privatization. These are aimed
at enhancing economic performance and improving social welfare over the medium term.
As articulated in its current Medium Term Reform Program (1992/93-1995/96) these
reforms continued to focus on reducing the role of the public sector in commercially-
oriented and industrial activities while creating a competitive and facilitative environment
to stimulate private investment and export. Under this program, real GDP growth is
targeted to improve to 3.5 percent by the mid-1990s.
1.8   Government policy has been largely successful in applying these policies:
*  On the macroeconomic front, the public sector continues to generate surpluses
in recent years;
*  Average inflation was reduced from 77.3 per cent in 1992 to about 25% in
1993-94;
*  The currency has traded freely in the parallel market and foreign exchange
deposits have grown from zero to over $500 million,
*  Financial sector policy has improved greatly in the past five years by opening
more to international markets, evening out the regulatory framework for
different categories of financial institutions, and lessening the requirement to
finance public debt;



- 3 -
*  The Jamaican Stock Exchange, although very small, grew rapidly in the early
1990s (it was the fastest growing market in the world in 1992); and
*  Privatization has proceeded successfully, with Bank support through the
Private Sector Development Adjustment Loan; over 50 entities have been
divested and at least an equal number are slated for privatization.
1.9   GOJ's economic objectives consist of supporting the stabilization program and
seeking sustained improvements in the public finances. GOJ is committed to continue
reducing the size and scope of the public sector and to stimulate efficient investment and
growth in the private sector. The GOJ has circulated for comment an Industrial Strategy
which outlines the tactics for growth. A number of externally-assisted reforms are also
taking place, such as the Bank-supported Tax Administration Reform Project (loan
amount US$13.2 million) which addresses the need to broaden the tax base, improve tax
collection and eliminate distortions. These efforts will serve to enhance recently
implemented tariff and customs reforms.
D. Bank Lending Strategy
1.10  The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), attached to the Reform of
Secondary Education Project (March 1993), updates the development agenda of GOJ.
The Bank Group's current assistance strategy includes the Private Sector Development
Adjustment Loan approved on June 15, 1993, designed to support trade reforms, the
privatization program, and other measures to increase the incentives for private
investment. A loan for the reform of secondary education in Jamaica was approved on
March 25, 1993, and a loan for Private Investment and Export Development was
approved on March 24, 1994. Future Bank lending would consist largely of investment
loan financing, tax administration reform, public sector modernization, transport, and
other infrastructure development, social investments, and private sector development.

2. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Background
2.1   Jamaica's sources of indigenous energy are limited, comprised of a relatively small
hydropower potential, bagasse and peat. The country therefore relies on imports, mainly
oil, to meet its energy needs. Hydropower potential in the country amounts to about 114
MW, of which 24 MW have been developed to date (about 4% of total installed
generation capacity). At present there are eight hydroelectric power plants which range in
capacity from 0.2 MW to 6 MW. Hydropower potential which may be economically
developed during the next 15-20 years is estimated at about 90 MW. Peat is the only
indigenous fuel available in Jamaica in relatively significant quantities; however, the
economic viability of peat development has not been proven and its adverse environmental
implications have deterred its use. Additional energy resources (other than fuelwood
which is used to produce charcoal) include substantial amounts of bagasse which is used
by the sugar industry as fuel for industrial steam and electricity generation. GOJ has tried
unsuccessfully to broaden and develop the country's indigenous sources of energy through
on-shore and off-shore drilling. Solar energy promises some economic potential in the
form of domestic water heating and crop drying. Barring significant discoveries of oil and
gas, or unforeseen technological breakthroughs, the country will continue to rely on
imported oil to meet most of its energy requirements.
B. Institutions and Sector Organization
2.2   The Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport (MPUT) is responsible for
overseeing the energy sector and coordinating policies with the Planning Institute of
Jamaica (PIOJ). In order to bring together various entities and agencies involved, to
implement energy sector policy with private sector participation, a Minister's Steering
Committee on Energy Sector Privatization (MSC) was established in 1990 under the
chairmanship of the Minister of Energy. This Committee is composed largely of policy makers
from a wide range of institutions; its role has been to oversee and review the implementation of
energy sector projects. The Committee has been strengthened with the creation of an Energy
Sector Policy Implementation Unit (ESPTU) in MPUT to ensure timely implementation of
GOJ's policy and energy sector projects. A Project Manager, with private sector experience,
presently heads the unit.
2.3   The operative institutions in the sector are the Jamaica Public Service Co. (JPS)
and the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ). PCJ is a wholly owned state corporation
established under the Petroleum Act of 1979, and is a holding company for several subsidiaries.
The activities of PCJ and its subsidiaries include importing crude oil and petroleum products,
refining crude oil, exporting some products, distributing petroleum products and the
exploration, development and management of petroleum resources. It's most important
subsidiary is Petrojam, which owns and operates the country's only refinery. Under an agreed



-5 -
program with the World Bank, Petrojam is now being privatized. PCJ's other significant
subsidiaries are the Petroleum Company of Jamaica (PETCOM), a petroleum marketing
subsidiary established in 1985, and Petronol, established in 1986, which produces ethanol. PCJ
is in the process of divesting most of these subsidiaries. At the same time, it has reduced the
size of its headquarters staff. The overall structure of petroleum product marketing and
distribution is dominated by three local affiliates of international companies (ESSO, Shell and
Texaco).
2.4   JPS, the only power utility in Jamaica, has had the sole responsibility for the
generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power for public consumption. The
GOJ has 99% ownership of the company which reports to MPUT. In addition to JPS,
there are a number of private independent generators of electricity who produce power for
their own consumption, i.e., the bauxite companies, the Caribbean Cement Company,
sugar estates and hotels. Of these, only the bauxite companies are connected to the grid
and provide it with a limited amount of electricity. Recently, JPS has entered into a
number of arrangements with Independent Power Producers to purchase power.
C. Government's Energy Sector Policy
2.5   The Government has a well-defined energy policy. The objectives of the energy
policy are to: (a) ensure stable and adequate energy supplies at the least economic cost
through a combination of public and private sector participation in a deregulated and
liberalized environment; (b) diversify the energy base, encourage the development of
indigenous energy resources where economically viable and technically feasible, and
ensure the security of energy supplies; (c) encourage efficiency in energy production,
conversion and use with the overall objectives of reducing the energy intensity of the
economy; (d) complement the country's industrial policy by recognizing the importance of
energy as a critical input to industrial growth and stability; (e) minimize the adverse
environmental effects and pollution caused by the production, storage, transport and use
of energy; and (f) establish an appropriate regulatory framework to protect consumers.
investors, the environment and sector entities.
2.6   The government expects to achieve these policy objectives by creating an enabling
environment to: (a) encourage private sector participation and investments through a
policy of divestment and appropriate regulatory framework; (b) promote the development
of indigenous energy sources where appropriate, technically and economically feasible; (c)
encourage energy conservation/efficiency on the supply side as well as demand side
management; (d) fully protect the environment while ensuring that adequate energy
supplies are available to the country and to sustain the desired rate of economic growth;
(e) maintain appropriate institutional arrangements to ensure that the stated objectives are
achieved; and stimulate industrial development by encouraging synergies from co-
generation. The protection of the environment remains a primary objective of the energy
policy and as such the environmental guidelines of the National Resource Conservation
Authority (NRCA) relating to the energy sector will be enforced.

2.7    At present Jamaica imports petroleum and petroleum products on favorable terms
from Venezuela and Mexico under the San Jose Accord. As long as these contractual
arrangements remain favorable from national interest point of view, they will be continued.
When the refinery is privatized, it is envisaged that the country will continue to enjoy the
benefits of crude oil supplies under the existing contractual arrangements. Given the
complete deregulation of the petroleum sector all individuals/entities are now free to
import crude and petroleum products. As the government believes that the processing of
crude is the desirable option and as such, will encourage refinery operation in the country
by way of a tariff differential.
2.8   In this context, the energy policy will: (a) provide competitive advantage for the
refining of petroleum through the granting of an appropriate differential between tariffs on
refinery feedstock and the importation of fully refined petroleum products; (b) seek to
enter into joint venture partnerships with the private sector with regards to the refinery
and other government owned energy entities; (c) review and optimize specifications for all
petroleum products to meet modern economic and environmental requirements; (d) ensure
that importers and marketers of petroleum will be required to supply the appropriate
ministry with timely and relevant information regarding imports, sales etc. The provision
of this information will be necessary for proper energy planning; (e) seek to ensure access
to common terminalling facilities on a transparent basis for all eligible marketers and
customers; (f) review and establish the policy for the pricing of petroleum products in
order to achieve the objective of withdrawing subsidies and promoting the policy of
energy conservation; (g) ensure that petroleum refinery/marketing companies will be
required to maintain a predetermined level of inventory. This level of inventory will
guarantee that the nation's petroleum supplies are maintained at the required level; and (h)
seek to maintain the protection of the environment and the preservation/encouragement of
natural and cultivated forests. Although, for example, government will cause overall
removal of subsidy on domestic kerosene to be gradually phased out, it will remain
committed to some direct subsidy to assist those poor households that can be identified as
totally dependent on that petroleum product for cooking and lighting.
2.9   GOJ has already carried out a series of actions to put in place its new sector
policy. Under support from Energy Sector Deregulation and Privatization Project (Ln
3502), establishment of ESPIU is assisting MPUT and MSC in the implementation of
energy related projects financed by multilateral agencies and the implementation of
privatization programs. Implementation of the energy policy entails that: (a) an
appropriate ministry will continue to have overall responsibility for the implementation of
the policy; (b) the ministry will create a central energy conservation and renewable unit
which will act as a facilitator for all new and renewable energy projects. This unit will
provide a central point for inputs from the public and the scientific community with regard
to technological developments etc. Ongoing information to the public will also be
provided by this unit; and (c) the Office of Utility Regulation (OUR), which will cover all
utility services, will be established in accordance with the Office of Utilities Regulation



-7 -
Act, 1995. This office will protect the interests of both consumers and the investor in the
provision and utilization of public utility services. The OUR will have oversight
responsibility for the regulatory framework for the energy sector.
D. Energy Consumption and Supply
2.10  In comparison with countries at a similar stage of development, the level of energy
consumption in Jamaica is fairly high. This is primarily due to the needs of the bauxite and
alumina industry which is highly energy intensive. In 1993, Jamaica's gross per capita
energy requirement was estimated at about 8.7 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) or 1,309 kg
of oil equivalent (kgoe) which compares with the average per capita consumption of 650
kgoe for economies at a similar level of per capita income. When corrected for
consumption in the bauxite/alumina industry, which accounts for around 50% of total
demand, per capita requirements fall to 650kgoe.
2.11   Commercial energy accounts for 91% oftotal gross energy requirements. On an
end use basis, 91 % of commercial energy is used in the form of petroleum, 7% in the form
of electricity and about 2% in the form of coal by the cement industry. The bauxite
industry accounts for 50% of total energy use, the transport sector for about 17%, the
sugar industry for about 5%, and the household sector for about 10%.
2.12  Jamaica's petroleum demand is mainly met through local refining and direct import
of refined petroleum products. In 1993, Jamaica imported about 18.3 million barrels
(MMB) of petroleum and petroleum products. About 6.6 MMB of refined products were
imported directly by the bauxite/alumina industry. With a nominal capacity of 35.5
thousand barrels per day (MBPD)2, the refinery imported 5.4 MMB (17 MBPD) of
feedstock and 6.2 MMB (18.6 MBPD) of refined products. Of the total feed stock, crude
oil from Mexico and Venezuela accounted for 79.7% and spikes (refined products as part
of refinery feedstock) accounted for 20.3%.
2.13   During the past 23 years, gross energy supplies and requirements in Jamaica have
increased at 1.8% p. a. Non-bauxite demand has increased at a rate of 1.6% since 1989.
Bauxite industry demand is more erratic (it jumped from 3.2 million boe in 1988 to 4.9
million boe in 1989) and was 8 million boe in 1993. Historic income elasticity of demand
for non-bauxite energy is estimated at 1.6. It is assumed that in the long run GDP, in real
terms, would grow at an average rate of 3% in 1994-95 and at 3.5% thereafter. In the
bauxite and alumina sector, demand for energy is projected to increase in line with the rise
in alumina production; for every ton of alumina produced, around 2.48 boe of energy are
required. Alumina production is projected to increase from 2.9 million tons in 1992 to 3.5
million tons by 1996; 3.75 million tons by 2000; and 4.25 million tons by 2005. Assuming
that the energy requirements of the non-bauxite sector increase at 4% p.a., total energy
2Bottlenecks in the refuning process currently reduce the effective throughput capacity to 26.4 MBPD.



-8 -
demand in Jamaica up to 2005 is projected to grow at 3.4% p.a. The energy demand in
2000 is projected at about 25.8 million boe and in 2005 at 30.6 million boe.
E. Energy Pricing: Petroleum Products
2.14   Refinery-gate petroleum prices were decontrolled, in an initial phase, in September
1990. Every week the refinery publishes ex-refinery billing prices which are based on:
reference postings in the US Gulf, freight; ocean losses and insurance costs; imputed
terminal and financing costs to supply products ex-terminal; and a tax element which is
fixed by the Government. The oil companies add to this price their own operating margins
and transport costs, and establish wholesale prices to the retailers. The retail traders add
their operational costs and margins and post ex-outlet prices.
2.15   Prices from outlet to outlet and company to company vary, and reflect some
element of competition in the market. While the program of decontrolling petroleum
prices had proceeded smoothly, it could not achieve the objective of realistic competition
until the market was fully decontrolled through the introduction of Caricom Common
External Tariffs (CET) on April 1, 1993. CET allows the import of refinery feed stock at
a 5% tariff and import of refined products at 15% tariff.
2.16   As of November 1994, retail prices for gasoline were on the order of US$1.14-
1.29/US gallon (USG); diesel fuel retailed at US$1.05-1.15/USG. These prices compare
to FOB US Gulf prices of US$0.70/USG for gasoline and US$0.59/USG for diesel oil.
The markup is accounted for by duties (US$0.20/USG for gasoline and US$0.1 5/USG for
diesel), freight, insurance, handling costs and marketing margins.
2.17   As household kerosene is used for cooking by about 25% of the low income
population, it continues to be subsidized. To ensure that the intended consumers benefit
from this subsidy, it is sold to the urban and rural households through kerosene peddlers
and local shops in tins or bottles. GOJ is considering to decontrol the price of kerosene
and introduce kerosene stamps to provide direct subsidy to poor population. GOJ intends
to review taxes on two-burner kerosene and gas stoves to determine how to discourage
the use of charcoal. The price of kerosene as of October, 1994 was US$0.70/USG.
F. Lessons learned from previous Bank operations
2.18   The Bank has made five loans totaling US$150.5 million for power sector
development.3 These lending operations have involved financing construction of
generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, and providing technical assistance for
3These loans include: (i) Power I (No. 454-JM) for US$22 million, approved in 1966 and completed in 1972; (ii)
Power II (No. 1516-3M) for US$20 million, approved in 1978 and completed in 1984; (iii) Power HI (No. 2188-
3M) for USS30.5 million, approved in 1982 and completed in 1987; (iv) Power IV (No. 2869-JM) for US$18
million, approved in 1987 and completed in 1995; and (v) Energy Sector Deregulation and Privatization Project
(Ln. 3502-JM) for US$60 million, approved in 1992 to finance JPS (US$20 million) and to support a power plant
in the private sector (US$40 million).



-9 -
improving operations and maintenance practices and overall efficiency of the JPS'
operations. The latter was particularly important during the implementation period of the
second loan (1516-JM of US$20.0 million, 1978) when adverse macroeconomic
conditions took their toll on the company. In addition, institution-building and training
and strengthening of sector human resources have all been a prominent focus of all Bank
lending operations in the Jamaican power sector.
2.19 The Third Power Project (Loan. 2188-JM, US$30.5 million) and Fourth Power
Project (Loan. 2869-JM, US$18 million), in addition to financing construction and
providing technical assistance and training, focused on rehabilitating plants and the
upgrading of the power system. The lessons learned from the Third Power Project have
been outlined and discussed in the Project Completion Report (Report No. 10252)
completed recently. The ongoing Fourth Power Project, approved in 1987, aimed at
improving operating efficiency within the JPS system by: (i) expanding and upgrading
transmission lines, substations and the distribution network; (ii) establishing a permanent
training center and training program; and (iii) providing engineering/consultant services for
JPS. The project was designed to help JPS meet its power needs through 1992. After
initial delays, the project is being implemented satisfactorily. The delays were primarily
due to: (a) the disruption and destruction to the system wrought by Hurricane Gilbert
which struck Jamaica in 1988; and (b) JPS' intemal procurement processes. The latter
constraint has been addressed by strengthening the Project Execution Unit (PEI) by
assigning a full time Project Director, and increasing the number of staff assigned to the
Unit. The training and studies components of the Project have been successfully
implemented. JPS also had difficulty in meeting the rate of return covenant of the loan,
except in 1992/93 when the RoR targets were exceeded. It is in compliance with all other
covenants. JPS' past financial performance and proposed measures to improve the
company's financial health are presented in part VI of this report.
2.20  In the petroleum subsector, the Bank has made one loan, the Petroleum
Exploration (Loan 2017-JM of 1981 for US$7.5 million), which was aimed at promoting
the exploration for and development of Jamaica's hydrocarbon potential. Although no
commercial discovery was reported, the project partially achieved its objectives by
increasing knowledge of the prospects of offshore and onshore areas. The negative results
of the exploration activities, and the lack of sound alternative uses led in January 1986 to
closure of the loan and cancellation of about 50% of the approved funds.



- 10-
3. THE POWER SUB-SECTOR
A. Background
3.1   The basic legislation goveming the power sub-sector consists of the Electric
Lighting Act of 1890 and the Electricity Development Act of 1974. The Electricity
Development Act established the Electricity Authority as the Agency responsible for
power sub-sector development. In addition, the Electricity Authority is empowered to
regulate the license-holding utilities. Under the electricity legislation, GOJ granted to JPS,
in 1978, a 39-year "All Island Electric License", which gives JPS the monopoly to supply
electricity to all parts of the island, as the sole supplier of electricity for public
consumption.
3.2    Although the Electricity Authority exists as a legal entity, in practice the functions
of this agency are carried out by MPUT. JPS provides monthly financial reports to
MPUT. MPUT is closely involved in JPS' investment plans and operating budgets. Rate
adjustment requests are filed to MPUT. After review and analysis, MPUT submits its
recommendations on rate adjustments to the Cabinet for final approval.
B. Government's Power Sector Policy
3.3    GOJ has taken the decision to deregulate and liberalized the electricity sector,
thereby allowing Independent Power Producers (IPP) to be the main players within the
sector, with the government becoming a minority partner. In this regard, all new
generating capacity is to be provided by private developers. GOJ has also announced its
intention to privatize JPS and invited applications from intemational companies for
prequalification to bid. These are major policy initiatives which are aimed at moving the
entire system of generation, transmission and distribution into private sector ownership
and management. Major policy initiatives, therefore, in the power sector are to ensure
that an appropriate regulatory framework is put in place to: (a) facilitate the timely
provision of new power generating capacity and the associated transmission works; (b)
establish an environment capable of attracting private investments in the power sector and
capable of supporting long term financing for the private sector; and (c) generally support
Jamaica's power sector privatization program.
3.4   The policy is intended to ensure that: (a) all new generation projects are
undertaken by the private sector; (b) the potential of co-generation to meet some portion
of electricity supply will be pursued and principles under which the electricity company
purchases electricity from co-generators, are clearly set out; (c) the company responsible
for generation capacity planning prepares a periodic least cost expansion plan for review
and approval of the competent authority; (d) the widespread publication of the indicative
least cost plan provides guidance to potential private sector investors in the development
of proposals for new plants; (e) appropriate regulatory oversight is put in place; (f)



- 11 -
electricity rate setting mechanism reflects the cost of power from private suppliers; and (g)
the Rural Electrification Programme (REP) is continued in order to maintain the extension
of electricity to rural areas with a view to fostering economic development and improving
the quality of life in rural communities.
3.5   Rate setting principles being followed by the power sector are: (a) rates should
reflect full costs including duties and taxes; (b) overall revenue requirements to be
established on the basis of existing loan agreements with international agencies and GOJ to
meet rate of return and/or self-financing tests; (c) indexing of foreign exchange and fuel
rate adjustment; and (d) tariffs to be structured according to long run marginal cost
principles reflecting peak and off-peak costs, voltage levels, capacity and energy costs.
The cost of long term power purchase agreements would also be reflected in the tariffs. It
was agreed that JPS will commission a comprehensive long run marginal cost study which
will be used as a basis for restructuring the tariffs.
C. Electricity Demand and Supply
3.6   In FY93/94, JPS's system generated a total of 2,266 GWh and the gross system
peak was 382 MW. Sales of electricity amounted to 1,838 GWh, delivered to some
352,700 customers across the island. In the last three years net generation and total kWh
sales have been stable, showing a relatively low growth (roughly 4.6% per annum) if
compared with previous years.
3.7   Market share is accounted for as follows: large commercial and industrial
customers account for 18.4% of kWh sales, the medium and small commercial and
industrial user's share is 46.8%, and the residential sector accounts for about 32%. The
number of customers increased by 9% in the last two years (by comparison, the increase
during FY90/91-91/92 was only 2.5%). Residential consumers make up 89.3% of the
total number of clients. Almost 10.3% of the customers belong to the small commercial
and industrial sector and the remaining 0.1 % are a few large industrial (75) and street
lighting (306) customers.
3.8   About 63% of the total population lives in dwellings which have access to
electricity, compared to 50% in 1985. Electricity consumption is concentrated in the
metropolitan areas of Kingston and Montego Bay which account for about 65% and 10%
of the country's total electric energy consumption, respectively. Average electricity
consumption per capita in 1993 was about 850 kWh/year, based on net generation. 1993
census data indicates that about 45% of the population lives in rural areas and from this
total about 40% are connected to the grid.
3.9   In order to accelerate the integration of the rural areas to the electrical grid, GOJ
created the REP in 1975, an independent entity, separate from JPS, to administer the rural
electrification program. The program consists of extensions from existing JPS lines, and
the provision of loans to assist homeowners in carrying out house installations. REP



- 12 -
receives soft financing from the Government (through loans from international agencies).
GOJ will continue to support the rural electrification program to extend electricity service
to foster economic development and improve the quality of life in rural communities.
3.10  Demand for electricity is expected to grow at about 5.6% annually in the next 10
years. The base demand forecast reflects GOJ's assumption on GDP and other economic
indicators (population growth, per capita electricity consumption, etc.). Annex 3.1 shows
historical demand and forecasts for the 1995-2013 period. The base demand forecast can
be summarized as follows:
Table 1. Electricity Demand Projections
l  Net Peak   |   Net Energy
Year      L                            GWh

2005                678         1      4,337
3.11  Electricity is generated in four thermal and eight small hydroelectric plants. The
distribution of generation between plants and type of units during FY 1993/94 was as
follows:
Table 2: Distribution Of Generation

3.12  Two types of fuel are used in the thermal plants; Bunker C Fuel Oil (FO) in the
steam and diesel units, and Diesel Oil (DO) in the gas turbines. Total fuel consumed in
FY93/94 was 3.75 million barrels of FO and 0.77 million barrels of DO. The most
efficient units are the diesel sets at Rockfort with an average heat rate of 9,170 BTU/kWh,
followed by the steam units at Old Harbour with 12,070 BTU/kWh. The gas turbines at
Bogue have an average heat rate of 16,438 BTU/kWh. The system average thermal plant
efficiency was around 13,000 Btu/kWh; the target estabiished in the previous Bank loan
was 12,550 BTU/kWh.
3.13  At the end of May 1994, JPS's total installed capacity was 621.7 MW, with an
available maximum continuous rating (MCR) of 568 MW. From this, about 23.6 MW
(3.7%) correspond to the eight small hydroelectric plants. The thermal generation is
composed of steam, gas turbines and diesel units, located at four different plant sites. The
largest plant is Old Harbour (OH) with four oil-fired steam units and a total of 230 MW
installed capacity. Nominal capacity of each of the two units 3 and 4 at OH are 55 MW
and 68.5 MW respectively (the largest unit in the system). At Hunt's Bay (HB) there are
four oil-fired steam units (unit number 2 is considered, for all practical purposes, already
retired) and five gas turbines, with 116 and 111.3 MW, respectively. At Bogue, in
Montego Bay, there were five gas turbines with a total installed capacity of 100.8 MW.
At Rockfort a barge with two identical diesel units of 20 MW each, provides 40MW of
capacity.
3.14  On June 3, 1994, an explosion occurred at OH unit number 4 boiler. The
explosion and subsequent fire, caused almost the complete destruction of the boiler, its
auxiliary, electrical and control systems, the main stores building and the chemical and
water treatment laboratory. Parts of the crane, the stack and the turbine-generator set of
unit number 4 were also damaged. In addition, the boiler of unit number 3 and auxiliaries
suffered damage. In total 137 MW (about 123 MW available MCR) were lost, equivalent
to more than 20% of the total available capacity. Subsequently JPS signed a private
power deal for 42 MW new peaking capacity at Bogue. The proposed project would
address the restoration of Old Harbour plant and other related power generation reliability
concerns.
3.15  The main transmission voltages in the JPS system are 138 and 69 kV. There is a
total of approximately 270 km of single-circuit 138 kV and 720 km of 69 kV transmission
lines which interconnect the generating plant with the main load centers. The 69 kV
system includes a ring and provides the primary supply to most of the main distribution
substations. The lines and associated substations, of this trunk transmission system are
relatively new and in good condition.
3.16  The incident at OH and changes required to accommodate the emergency
generation recovery plan will create some short term transmission constraints in the
system. Modifications to the transmission system included in the proposed project will
address transmission constraint.

D. System Losses
3.17  In the last five years average system losses have been in the order of 20%, despite
major investments in the distribution system and the activities and measures carried out by
JPS's Power Loss Reduction Unit during the last three years. Total electrical system
energy losses in FY 93/94 amounted to 19.4%, a reduction of 1.6% from the 21% figure
for FY 92/93. A breakdown of total losses yields losses of 2.5% in the transmission
system which are reasonable, but distribution losses on the order of 16.9% (8.5% technical
and 8.4% non-technical) which are well above the standards for the industry. Non-
technical losses amount to about 43.5% of total losses. Renewed and more aggressive
actions are required from JPS on this front. A specific action program to reduce energy
losses, particularly non-technical losses, is a part of the Corporate Action Plan. The
progress of this Plan will be monitored during project implementation.
E. Electricity Tariffs
3.18   The existing tariff schedule is based on a straightforward structure: (i) a
Residential Service (Rate 10) with two energy blocks and a customer fixed charge; (ii) a
General Service (Rate 20) with a flat energy charge and a fixed customer charge; (iii) a
Power Service (Rate 40) with demand and energy charges, a fixed customer charge, a
time-of-day option and transformer discount; (iv) a Large Power Service (Rate 50),
similar to rate 40 except time of day discount applicable to primary service; and (v) a
Street Lighting Service (Rate 60) with a flat rate per type of lamp. All rates incorporate a
fuel adjustment clause which provides for six monthly (albeit lagged) adjustments
according to fuel cost variations, and a foreign exchange adjustment clause which allows
JPS to recover tariff loss due to exchange rate changes, linked to its foreign currency
expenses (estimated to be on average 75% of its total costs).
3.19  Average revenues for JPS are currently on the order of US Cents 12.5/kWh. They
have decreased from a level of 13.5 to 14.0 US Cents per kWh in October 1992 (date of
the latest adjustment), despite the automatic adjustment clauses. One reason for this
decline lies in the absence of an automatic adjustment to track the relatively high local
inflation. JPS in the recent past has been unable to meet covenanted 8% rate of return on its
fixed assets. GOJ has taken measures to deal with both this issues. Having announced its
intention to privatize JPS, GOJ is in the process of revaluing JPS' assets based on their realistic
market value. Based on a 13.4% requested increase in tariffs at the beginning of the fiscal year,
JPS has projected that it will yield a 6% return on current valuation of assets. If, as is most
likely, this increase is delayed until October 1995, the projected return will drop to 4.2%. As a
consequence of the explosion and streamlining of its organizational structure prior to
privatization, JPS is expected to incur one time additional expenses of about J$832 million in
FY95/96. If these expenses were excluded, and the requested tariff increase is only effective in
October 1995, the rate of return would be about 8.8%. During the mid-term review of the
ESDPP, JPS' financial performnance will be critically reviewed.

3.20 Concerning tariff levels, C&L performed a preliminary evaluation of long-run
marginal costs as part of the restructuring study in 1992. The study showed that at that
time tariffs exceeded the long run marginal costs by about 15%. Additionally, the study
showed that significant differences existed between tariffs and marginal cost for individual
customer categories, ranging from +35% for residential customers to -3% for power
service. C&L forewarned that due to the limited information available on customer load
characteristics, results for individual customer categories should be used cautiously. As
part of the Power IV Project (Loan 2869-JM) a load research program is at present in
place to determine reliable load composition parameters which should be used for the
assessment and allocation of costs for tariff setting purposes.

4. THE PROJECT
A. Background
4.1   Following the explosion and consequent fire at OH unit number 4 on June 3, 1994,
JPS suffered a major reduction in its power generating capacity. In addition to the
destruction of the unit number 4 boiler and its auxiliaries, the explosion also caused severe
damage to the unit number 3 boiler. The damage from the incident also included the
destruction of the control building, control equipment, unit electrical auxiliary equipment,
damage to the turbine-generator bearings and the destruction of the chemical laboratory
building and of the stores building. Investigations indicate two possible causes which may
have led to the incident: (a) fuel explosion in the furnace of the boiler of Unit No. 4; or (b)
over pressure in the boiler of Unit No. 4, possibly due to generating tube failure. Forensic
Technology International, an international firm of consultants, has concluded that JPS
"had adopted reasonable approach to maintaining safe operational conditions."
4.2   The incident resulted in a reduction of 123 MW capacity thus reducing the
available baseload capacity by 33%. As a result, the system's installed margin was
severely reduced from 49% to 17%. The units lost in the incident were two of the large
base load units in the system. Units 3 and 4 are similar oil-fired steam plants with MCR
ratings of 55MW and 68.5MW, respectively (Foster Wheeler boilers and General Electric
turbines). They were installed in 1972/73.
4.3   The loss of these units has led to much higher load factors on older generating
capacity normally used for peaking and standby service, with consequent reduction of
system reliability. This was manifested after the incident by rotating blackouts. The loss of
two of the lowest operating cost units also resulted in an increased operating cost in
excess of US$50,000 per day. The costs imposed on JPS as a result of the incident also
affected other developments planned by JPS. These projects included the restoration and
upgrade of three gas turbines, telecommunication and energy management system
improvements.
B. Emergency Generation Recovery Program
4.4   Immediately after the explosion, JPS developed and implemented an Emergency
Generation Recovery Program to:
 Identify the extent of the damage, scope of work, lead time and cost to restore OH
units number 3 and number 4 to service.
 Implement practical emergency measures to alleviate the situation,



- 17 -
Review and revise JPS's generation strategy to restore the system to normal in the
shortest possible time and to adjust the long term plans.
4.5   This plan determined the best effort lead times to restore Old Harbour units
number 3 and number 4, as follows:
Lead Time          In-Service Date
Old Harbour unit number 3      6 months           December 1994
Old Harbour unit number 4     13 months           July 1995
4.6   Due to the extent of the loss, JPS has implemented the following steps:
* An aggressive demand management program and planned load shedding schedule
* Major adjustments to the planned maintenance schedule
* The procurement of emergency capacity
* An aggressive implementation schedule to rehabilitate the damaged units.
4.7   Emergency capacity has been obtained by negotiating a three-year supply contract
with Kenetech who will provide 40MW from gas turbine sets at Bogue (peaking units).
4.8   The decision to repair Old Harbour unit 3 was straightforward: the unit was not
irreparably damaged and the materials were on-site for the planned overhaul of unit
number 4; these factors plus an established lead time of 6 months to repair unit number 3
led to a quick decision to proceed immediately to restore the unit. The decision to replace
or rebuild unit number 4 required investigation of the lead time to replace the boiler and
other damaged components as well as the economics of procuring a different plant
configuration.
4.9   The replacement options considered were:
* replace the damaged components by sole source negotiated contract
*  intemational competitive tender for a new boiler and replacement components
* discontinue use of unit number 4 turbine and replace the unit with new generating
equipment
4.10  To investigate the shortest lead time to repair unit number 4, JPS requested
proposals from the original boiler supplier, Foster-Wheeler, and from a reputable



- 18 -
competitor, Babcock-Wilcox. The original supplier submitted a proposal with a 7 month
schedule from order to first steam; the alternate proposal was based on a schedule of 13.5
months. An additional two months were considered necessary to complete all the repairs.
Through this process, JPS concluded a contract with Foster-Wheeler to replace the boiler
and auxiliaries and rebuild the balance of damaged plant.
4.11  In addition to the repair and rebuild of the two Old Harbour units, JPS identified
the feasibility of implementing the life extension and upgrading work on three GE Frame 5
gas turbine generating sets which have been used by JPS for peaking and standby
purposes. One of them is located at the Bogue power station and the other two are
located at Hunts Bay power station.
C. Project Objectives and Description
4.12  Objectives. The proposed project has the following objectives:
*  To restore electricity service to normal conditions as early as possible, thus
eliminating costly power cuts;
*  To reduce generation costs through lower running cost plants, save on capital costs
by upgrading existing facilities and safeguard the system against the breakdown of
existing units due to extended use;
* To improve generation security, enhance system reliability and control systems to
reduce the likelihood of future recurrence of generating plant incidents by
improving the telecommunications and energy control systems and by reinforcing
the transmission network;
*  To improve resource allocation through the reform of electricity tariffs and ensure
that loss of base load generation capacity does not adversely affect the environment
for increasing private sector participation in the power sector; and
*  To reduce and control the environmental impact associated with power system
facilities.
4.13   Project Components. To achieve its objectives, the overall project will consist of
the following elements:
* Restoration of Old Harbour Unit 3;
* Restoration of Old Harbour Unit 4 boiler;
* Life extension of Old Harbour Unit 4 generation turbine;



- 19 -
* Gas turbine Units 3, 4 and 5 upgrade;
* Transmission system reinforcements; and
* Upgrading of the energy control center and associated telecommunications
facilities;
4.14  Additionally, consulting services will be required for:
* technical supervision and project management for the generating system
components of the project;
*  engineering and project management for the environmental mitigation component
of the project.
-  cost of service and tariff reform studies;
A detailed description of the components of the project is presented in Annex 4. 1.
4.15   Restoration of Old Harbour Unit 3. This component of the project comprises
repairs to the boiler and rehabilitation to both boiler and turbine. JPS has used the
opportunity to rehabilitate the unit by redirecting a contract which was in place for a major
overhaul of unit number 4 in order to minimize the lead time required for essential repairs.
Originally JPS had established the return to service of unit number 3 as of February 1995;
but, the progress on this portion of the work was ahead of schedule and the unit returned
to service in December 1994. Financing for this component was provided by IDB.
4.16   Restoration of Old Harbour Unit 4 Boiler. The work contemplated for this
component of the project consists of rebuilding the boiler to improved specifications and
associated fuel handling, fuel burning, steam and feedwater piping, fan and stack which
were destroyed or damaged. In addition, this component includes rebuilding of the
control facilities, the chemical laboratory and stores building and their equipment.
4.17  The costs of repair or replacement plant and structures is covered by an all riskC
insurance policy. The insurers' liability is limited to replacement or repair of the plant,
equipment and buildings at the lowest cost and in the most expeditious manner in order to
limit the consequential losses incurred by higher operating costs. Based oni the
negotiations and investigations carried out by JPS, it has been determined that:
* the drums from the damaged boiler on unit numrber 4 can be repaired and reused;
and



- 20 -
* the lead time required to return the steamn generating facilities to service could be
reduced to 7 months from date of order by direct negotiation of a design, supply
and install contract with the original supplier, Foster-Wheeler.
4.18   The total estimate for repair, replacement and life extension of unit number 4 is
about US$31 million. JPS's main problem has been to secure financing for rebuilding the
plant. JPS is unable to fund the rebuild by itself In their investigation of the lowest cost
to achieve a return to service, JPS identified alternate financing methods. The sources
considered were insurance advances, IBRD financing, and supplier credit:
* The insurers have made advances of about US$2.2 million against the Loss
Adjuster's recommendation for an advance of US$ 10.0 million. JPS has been
advised that there is disagreement among the group of insurers about the extent of
4
liability between each insurer.
*  In order to utilize IBRD financing, JPS would be required to seek international
competitive bids for the repair and replacement. The mission established a best
effort schedule for this exercise of 18 months based on a lead time required to
prepare tender documents, bid period, bid evaluation and award of 4 months plus
12 months from order to first steam and 2 months for final completion.
*  The main component which defines the 12 month period is the supply of new boiler
drums. In ongoing negotiations, JPS has received an offer from Foster-Wheeler
for supplier's credit together with a technical proposal to re-utilize the drums from
the original boiler and to meet a schedule of 7 months from order to first steam.
4.19   Accordingly, the only and least cost approach for JPS for the repair and
replacement of Old Harbour Unit number 4 steam generating facilities and associated
equipment and buildings was to proceed with finalizing the negotiations with Foster-
Wheeler, the original manufacturers of the boiler.
4.20 Life Extension of Old Harbour Unit 4 Generation Turbine. Prior to the
explosion, JPS had in place a contract to carry out rehabilitation work on Unit 4 in August
1994; the necessary materials were on order and most of them had been delivered. After
the incident, JPS established that the shortest time frame required to return Unit 3 to
service was 6 months; this was based on using the materials and contract already in place
for the planned work on Unit 4.
4.21   Having adopted this strategy, JPS developed a new approach to the rehabilitation
of Unit 4. Considering the replacement of the Unit 4 boiler and auxiliaries with new
components, an opportunity arose to carry out a comprehensive life extension program on
the Unit 4 turbine-generating facility to enable JPS to defer the unit's retirement from
As of the time of negotiation JPS had received US$25 million against the approved US$35 million.



- 21 -
2002 to around 2017. The investigation by JPS led to a plan to incorporate detailed
design modifications to the turbine-generator set as well as some of the turbine auxiliary
systems. JPS received a detailed proposal from the original manufacturer (GE) and is
negotiating a contract for implementation in parallel with the boiler replacement
component. The project preparation mission recommended additional work on turbine
auxiliaries to improve efficiency and reliability over the extended life of the unit.
4.22 The only way to ensure that the life extension can be completed in parallel with the
boiler replacement, is that this component be dealt with by direct negotiation with the
original manufacturer, GE. This is also shown to be the most cost effective alternative.
The proposed Bank project will finance this component.
4.23   Gas Turbines Units 3, 4 and 5 Upgrade. This project component comprises
restoration and life extension of three Frame 5 General Electric gas turbines. The gas
turbines were installed in 1973 and 1974 and were scheduled to be decommissioned 1997
and 1998. The units have been operated as peak load capacity with a total operating
hours ranging from 26,000 to 45,000 hours. As a result of the loss of generating capacity
at Old Harbour, these units are now operating at higher load factors.
4.24  The proposed project component consists of replacing parts of the gas turbines
with new and modem equipment in order to improve unit efficiency, to increase their
reliability and to extend the technical life by about 10 years. The anticipated performance
improvements include an increased output of about 5% and reductions in heat rates
ranging from 2.3% to 10.5%. The duration of the required work is estimated at two
months for each unit.
4.25  Upgrade and life extension programs on existing plant are an increasingly common
practice in the utility industry due to the capital cost of new plants and the problems
associated with siting of new facilities. Upgrading of existing plant also permits utilities to
incorporate the benefits of ongoing research and development work undertaken by the
equipment manufacturers. In order to ensure the success of such programs, it is common
practice in the industry to negotiate a contract with the original designer/manufacturer of
the plant because of the risk of failure to meet expectations involved with trying to
incorporate components from other suppliers.
4.26  JPS has negotiated the life extension contract for GTs with GE. Work on GT Unit
3 started in February 1995 on an urgent basis as this Unit was no longer operable. The
target date for GT Units 4 and 5, is March 1995. JPS will finance this project component.
4.27 Telecommunication and Energy Management Systems (EMS). The existing
EMS, has become obsolete: the system has been abandoned by Harris Computer, the
initial contractor and training is no longer offered for the present facilities. The same
considerations apply to the existing telecommunications system; at present, the network
includes analog microwave radio which spans five major repeater stations; the system has



- 22 -
various problems such as high fault rates, unreliable Power Line Carrier equipment,
insufficient standby radio links, an insecure network arrangement, a lack of a
Communication Control facility, low channel capacity, no expansion capability, and
dependence on the Public Telecommunications Company.
4.28   The project will supply a new EMS based on a distributed system architecture and
will support Automatic Generation Control to reduce system operating costs and
supervisory control for all Remote Terminal Units in order to improve system reliability.
The new system will be able to manage incoming alarms in a clear, concise and timely
manner and will manage load shedding functions under emergency situations. The project
will supply a digital microwave network consisting of a 2 GHz backbone radio, UHF
digital radios and the necessary multiplex and auxiliary equipment.
4.29  Transmission and Substation Reinforcements. To accommodate the scheduled
addition of 72MW of new generating capacity at Old Harbour (Wartsila/Iamaica Energy
Partners barge), it is necessary to provide reinforcements to the transmission system to
assure the interconnection of this new facility and the reliable transmissi n of power from
Old Harbour. The proposed reinforcements consist of:
* Construction of 32km of 138kV lines between Parnassus and Spur Tree with
attendant substation facilities for interconnection;
X Construction of 16km of 138kV lines between Spur Tree and Kendal with
attendant substation facilities; and
* Substation expansion to accommodate the Wartsila/JEP 72MW barge
The total estimated cost for these transmission and substation modifications is approximately
US$ 12 million which is being financed by IDB.
4.30  Environmental Mitigation Measures. This component of the project comprises
the development and implementation of measures recommended in the EA report for the
Old Harbour Plant. These measures include:
* Implementing sulfur dioxide mitigatory measures;
* Provision of a waste-water treatment plant;
* Oil spill prevention, containment and counter measures;
* Environmental training of JPS personnel,
* Laboratory upgrading; and



- 23 -
Asbestos and PCB surveys and preparation of management plans.
4.31   Other measures recommended in this and previous environmental reports (such as
improved boiler controls, stack emissions monitoring and on-line condenser tube cleaning)
are included in this project component for Old Harbour plant site. A detailed discussion of
the environmental issues and mitigation plan is presented in Annex 4.3.
D. Rationale for Bank Involvement
4.32   The Bank has a long term involvement in the energy sector and so far has financed
five power and one petroleum sector projects. With the deregulation and privatization of
public sector entities, the character of the public sector investments is changing with
increased opportunities for the private sector and IFC investments.
4.33   The GOJ is clearly committed to sector reform involving regulation and private
sector participation through its energy sector and power sector policy initiatives. As a
consequence, JPS is implementing a major restructuring of its corporate organization in
order to incorporate efficiency incentives through market measures. However, during the
period JPS is being prepared for privatization, it is essential that its generation facilities be
maintained. Similarly, a regulated enterprise, should be able to manage its transmission
system with a high degree of reliability and to dispatch all generation facilities.
4.34   Bank support for the proposed project will ensure that the system can return to
normal generating conditions, thereby allowing the power sector reorganization plan to
proceed smoothly. Given the Bank's recent experience in structuring private sector
projects and its in-depth knowledge of the country, the project will be implemented on a
fast track basis. By allowing expanded energy supplies, the project also conforms to the
Bank's initiative for supporting infrastructure developments which are necessary to
enhance growth and reduce poverty, as noted in the 1994 CEM.
E. Status of Project Preparation
4.35   Project preparation is well advanced for most components. The status of each of
the components, at the time of negotiations is as follows:
*  The repair and rehabilitation of Old Harbour Unit 3 is complete;
* A contract for Unit 4 boiler and auxiliaries replacement and repair of other plant
components is in its final stages through direct negotiation with Foster Wheeler, the
selected supplier;
* The contract rehabilitation and life extension for Unit 4 turbine-generator set is
now being finalized with GE;



- 24 -
* The life extension and upgrade of three gas turbines is now being implemented;
* The telecommunication technical specifications have been completed; basic design
and feasibility for the expansion of the Energy Management System has been
completed; and
*  The environrnental assessment of the project is at final stages and the
recommended mitigation measures will form part of the proposed project.
4.36  JPS has a project organization and structure in place for the generation-related
components. The environmental mitigation component will be addressed by engaging a
consulting firm to prepare specifications for tendering for the design, supply and
installation of the required facilities; the consulting firm will also provide contract
performance assistance to the JPS' Project Executing Unit (PEU). The project also
includes the provision of consulting services to the JPS project group for the generation
components. JPS will retain ECC, Inc. in order to prepare functional designs,
specifications and tender documents for the EMS component.
F. Project Cost Estimate
4.37  Project costs at December 1994 price levels are estimated to amount to the
equivalent of US$ 72.2 million, of which US$ 62.7 million (87%) correspond to foreign
costs. The estimated costs include physical and price contingencies and exclude taxes and
duties. Interest during construction (IDC) is estimated to amount to US$ 4.3 million.
Total financing requirements amount to US$ 76.5 million. Annex 4.4 provides a detailed
cost estimate. A summary of the estimated project costs is shown in the following table.

4.38  Due to the scope of the proposed project, the individual components are of
different nature; consequently different approaches have been used to establish the project
cost estimates. Approximately 70 % of the base cost estimates are determined from offers
received from potential contractors and suppliers. This is the case for important project
components such as the restoration and rehabilitation works at the Old Harbour Power
Station (OH) units, and the gas turbine upgrade. The estimated cost of environmental
mitigation measures is to be considered as preliminary; it was based on site inspections at
the OH Station and cost estimates included in an environmental assessment report
prepared by a German consulting company. Other project component costs have been
determined based upon known unit prices and engineering judgment.
4.39  The cost estimates for the consulting services and project management support
have been estimated by using different approaches. For the environmental mitigation
measures the costs are estimated to amount to around 10 % of the base cost estimate for
that project component, which is in line with common practice for such projects. The cost
estimates for the remaining parts of the consulting services and project management
support is based on estimated man-month requirements and needs for technical support.



- 26 -
4.40 For the foreign costs, which mainly include materials, equipment and technical
support of specialists, a physical contingency of 5% has been added to the base price
estimates. Physical contingencies for the local currency component, which comprises
labor costs and some civil works, were estimated at approximately 10 % of the local
costs. Interest during construction (based on 7.5% p.a.) for a project component is
calculated as the full interest on the estimated component cost during a period equal to
half of the estimated implementation time.
G. Project Financing Plan
4.41  The project financing plan is shown in the table below. In the proposed project the
Bank would finance foreign currency project components equivalent to US$ 21 million.

4.42 Implementation of non-Bank financed components will take place in parallel with
the IBRD financed project. Financing of US$26-27 million by JPS is expected to originate
mainly from the insurance settlement. Therefore, the net funding required from JPS from
its internal cash generation would amount to around US$ 5 million.

H. Project Implementation Plan
4.43  The emergency recovery plan has required an early start regarding recovery works
at Old Harbour and the preparation and implementation of some proposed project compo-
nents has already commenced. In particular, this is the case for project components
directly related to damages caused by the explosion and foreseen to be covered totally
and/or partly by the Insurer.
4.44  For project components related to the generation improvement program, the
procurement activities started in early 1995 and all project components are expected to be
completed by the end of 1997. The table below shows the implementation schedule for the
different project components. A Time Schedule for the proposed project is found in Annex
4.6. The project will be implemented by JPS and the proceeds of the Loan will be onlent
to JPS by the Borrower at the same terms and conditions of the Loan. For this purpose,
the Borrower will sign a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with JPS. The signing of this
Agreement will be a condition for effectiveness.

which has gained experience from other Bank-financed projects, such as the Fourth Power
Project and from the on-going restoration works at the OH Power Station. The PEU will
be in charge of the proposed project and will appoint a qualified Project Manager. The

Project Manager will coordinate the activities with other areas of JPS, such as the
production and financial sectors of the generation Division. Further, the Project Manager
will liaise with the environmental department under the Corporate Service Sector of JPS.
Project management, preparation of engineering and procurement documents, evaluation
of bids, implementation of physical project components and environmental mitigation
measures would be performed by the PEU with the assistance of an international
consulting firm. Within JPS, the present PEU is an integral part of the Transmission
Engineering Section, which in turn reports to the Senior Director of the division for
transmission, Transdiv. The overall organization chart of JPS is shown in Annex 6.1; the
organization of the PEU is shown in Annex 4.2. PEU will submit monthly progress
reports to ESPIU, which will ensure that project implementation programs run smoothly.
ESPIU will submit to the Bank quarterly reports.
4.46  Project Monitoring. Performance targets have been established to: (i) measure
the timely and efficient execution of the project; and (ii) improve the overall performance
of JPS. The execution of the project will be monitored against target dates shown in the
implementation schedule shown in Annex 4.6. The implementation of the environmental
mitigation measures would be monitored against the plan to be agreed with JPS before the
loan becomes effective.
I. Procurement Procedures
4.47  JPS has established its own procurement procedure for project components not
financed by the Bank. For those project components which will be financed by the Bank
the applicable Bank procurement procedures will be applied (para. 4.48). JPS is familiar
with these procedures; the procurement of Bank financed project components will be
carried out with the assistance of an experienced procurement consultant, to be financed
under the project.
4.48  The following table summarizes the procurement procedure to be applied for the
different project components:

4.49   The life extension program of the Old Harbour Unit 4 will require deliveries of
specially manufactured parts designed for the installed turbine. Due to the special require-



- 30 -
ments mentioned in paras. 4.22 and 4.25, this project component is proposed to be carried
out by the original Unit 4 turbine manufacturer under a direct negotiated contract
estimated to cost US$9 million. The Bank would finance part of this contract
retroactively (about US$6.3 million or 30% of the loan amount). International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be used for the procurement of goods and works for the
Telecommunication and Energy Management System and the Environmental Mitigation
measures. Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures will be used for works contracts
estimated to cost less than US$150,000, up to an aggregate of US$1.0 million and
shopping for US$0.1 million. Contracts for small quantities of training material and other
related equipment, in packages valued at less than US$25,000 each, will be procured using
local and international shopping procedures. The aggregate amount of such procurement
will not exceed US$100,000.
4.50  Consulting services will be contracted following the Bank's guidelines for such
services. Individual consultants for technical assistance and training of personnel for the
use and operation of new equipment, will also be hired following the Bank's guidelines.
4.51   The Bank's prior review of proposed invitations, award recommendations and final
contracts will be required for: (i) all contracts for works and goods procured under ICB,
and procured from single source suppliers; (ii) all contracts for consulting services with
individuals, except those with an estimated cost below US$ 25,000; and (iii) all
consultancy services contracts with firms. For all consulting services, prior review of the
terms of reference will be required. Post review by the Bank, for all contracts not subject
to prior review, will cover the relevant supporting documentation on a selective basis
during the supervision of the project. As a result of these procedures, the Bank's prior
review will cover more than 95% of the Bank's financing. For contracts to be procured
under ICB, the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the Bank will be used.
Similarly for consulting contracts with consulting firms, the Bank standard form of
contract will be used.
J. Disbursements
4.52  The proceeds of the Bank loan are expected to be disbursed over a three-year
period. The disbursement schedule was derived from the implementation plan. Proceeds of
the proposed Bank loan would be used to finance:
*  100% of foreign expenditures for purchase of equipment, materials and works
for the Life Extension of Old Harbour unit number 4;
*  100% of total foreign and local (ex-factory) expenditures and 80% of others
being procured locally for purchase of equipment, materials and works for the
telecommunications and EMS component;



- 31 -
*  100% of foreign and local (ex-factory) expenditures and 80% of other items
procured locally for purchase of equipment, materials and works for
Environmental Mitigation Measures at the Old Harbour Power Station, which
include: (a) ambient sulfur dioxide monitoring; (b) wastewater treatment
plant; (c) oil spillage containment; and (d) laboratory upgrading.
* 100% of total expenditures for consulting services, technical assistance and
studies.
4.53  The Bank has agreed to retroactive financing, up to US$6.3 million, for
expenditures incurred after January 1, 1995, to cover expenses incurred for the Life
Extension of Unit 4. The Bank has granted a PPA in the amount of US$480,000 to assist
in the recruitment of consultants to help to prepare the restoration program.
4.54  A special account will be established in Bank of Jamaica with an authorized
amount of US$500,000 and an initial deposit limited to US$250,000, until disbursements
reach US$10 million.
4.55  Audits: All records relating to project expenditures will be kept by the PEU with
JPS. The audit report for the project expenditures and the special account will be
prepared, in accordance with appropriate accounting principles, by JPS external auditors.
The audit will be submitted no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year.
4.56  JPS will submit by August 1 of each year an updated and approved five year action
plan and its revenues and expenditures. In addition the PEU and consultants supervising
the program implementation will produce quarterly reports on the progress of each
component. JPS will regularly submit these progress reports to the Bank.
4.57  Disbursement requests would be fully documented except for payments against
contracts whose value does not exceed US$ 25,000. Claims for lesser amounts would be
subject to presentation of a statement of expenditures for which the supporting
documentation would be kept by the borrower for Bank review, on a selective basis,
during supervision. The borrower would be required to have annual audits for project
accounts. The closing date of the loan would be June 30, 1998.
K. Environmental Considerations
4.58  In March 1994, prior to the loss of Units 3 and 4, JPS contracted Fichtner (a
German consultant ) to conduct an EA for the Old Harbour Power Plant. The
recommendations of that EA included: installation of a wastewater treatment plant; oil
spillage containment; remediation of contaminated soils; installation of an on-line
condenser cleaning system; and laboratory upgrading.



- 32 -
4.59  The restoration of Unit 4 will occur just before a new 72MW medium speed diesel
barge facility is to be installed at the Old Harbour Plant site. The barge facility is being
developed by Jamaica Energy Partners who have an agreement to provide power to JPS
for 20 years commencing September 1995. It will be independent of the existing plant but
will discharge cooling water into the existing cooling water canal. The EA prepared by
Fichtner did not consider the proposed barge facility. A separate EA is being prepared by
Dynalytics Corporation (a US consultant) for the developer of the barge facility.
4.60 A new EA of the Old Harbour Plant is being prepared by HTB-AGRA, an
environmental consultant. This EA will comply with the Bank's OD4.01: Environmental
Assessment. It considers the impacts from the operating Units I and 2; the Unit 3 which
has just been restored (through IDB financing); the Unit 4 which will be restored under
the proposed Bank loan; and the barge unit which will be financed by a private developer.
This EA would consider the Jamaican as well as the Bank's environmental requirements.
The Jamaican requirements include the interim environmental standards. The Bank's
environmental requirements include the 1988 Environmental Guidelines.
4.61  Based on the results of the air dispersion model used in the EA, it appears that the
ambient sulfur dioxide levels proposed by NRCA and recommended by the World Bank
may not be met without mitigatory measures. It was agreed that JPS shall prepare and
furnish to the Bank, and thereafter carry out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, an
action plan, satisfactory to the Bank and NRCA to implement environmental mitigation
measures including, inter alia, the measures for reducing emission levels of sulfur dioxide
(SO2) at the Old Harbour Power Plant in order to comply: (i) by December 31, 1999, with
the Bank's standards set forth in the "World Bank Environmental Guidelines", published
by the Bank in September 1988; and (ii) by December 31, 2000, with NRCA's standards
as of the date of the Loan Agreement. Bank would receive the findings and
recommendations of this study, carried out under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank,
prior to effectiveness of the Loan.
4.62  Wastewater discharges from the steam plant exceeds the Bank guidelines due to
the lack of a treatment plant to handle the air preheated and boiler waste water. These
contain high levels of heavy metals which are currently discharged untreated to the cooling
water effluent. A treatment plant to handle wastewater from all units will be constructed
as part of this project. The terms of reference for a treatment plant design are provided in
Annex 4.8.
4.63  Prior activities have contaminated the site with fuel oil, in the tank farm and along
the oil transfer piping route. To prevent future contamination the tank farm will be
contained in an impermeable dike and base and the piping installed in an impermeable
trench. Remediation of contaminated areas, construction of improved secondary
containment and a chemical storage area will be undertaken as part of this project. The
terms of reference are provided in Annex 4.8.



- 33 -
4.64 JPS has commenced a program of environmental stewardship through the
mitigation program underway at Hunts Bay and Rockfort Power plants. This involved
strengthening through the establishment of an organizational structure for monitoring
environmental performance. This structure will be further strengthened through training in
such areas as environmental monitoring and spill prevention, control and countermeasures.
4.65   An asbestos survey is required, followed by a management plan prior to the start
of construction activities. This will be done by JPS staff who have had asbestos training.
A PCB survey and management plan also will be undertaken by JPS staff
4.66  The laboratory of the Old Harbour Plant was destroyed during the June 1994
explosion. The laboratory will be reconstructed under this project and used for
environmental monitoring.
4.67 Considering the environmental improvements that will be achieved with this
emergency project, the proposed project has been assigned a "B" environmental rating.
L. Project Risks
4.68   The identified risks to the project include: continued government commitment to
privatization of the energy sector; JPS ability to bring down system losses and relapse in NWC
receivables; and failure to collect on the insurance payments. Under the Private Sector
Development Adjustment Loan and ESDPP projects, GOJ is proceeding with the agreed
privatization program. Progress on this program will be confirmed during the mid-term review
of ESDPP. Concerning the level of system losses, JPS has established an acceptable action
plan which will be reviewed and updated during the supervision of the proposed project. The
risk of relapse in the NWC receivables is low because it has now been financially restructured
and will be able to meet its commitments. Concerning the failure to collect on insurance
claims, JPS has retained the legal and technical services to assist in the resolution of this matter.
4.69  Three additional risks to the project may be: cost, technology, organization and
management. A large portion of the project cost estimates (about 70%) have been
established in the course of detailed negotiations with suppliers and contractors. This
reduces the risk of cost overruns to a low risk. The level of risk is reflected in the
contingency used. There is a significant risk associated with the recovery of losses from
the insurers. JPS has retained specialist advice which has assessed a 50% probability of a
long delay in recovery of funds. JPS therefore faces a potential problem with financing the
restoration of Old Harbour Unit 4 boiler. In addition to this risk, JPS also faces a risk of
cost increases as a result of planned metallurgical examinations of the turbine during the
life extension work. JPS is addressing this risk by arranging short term commercial
financing through government guarantees.
4.70   The technologies proposed for the various components are adequately tested and
the most current in use. In the case of the steam generating facilities, the technologies are



- 34 -
considered proven by the manufacturers and, therefore, the risk of failure to achieve
expected performance improvements is considered low. It was suggested that JPS
negotiate suitable performance guarantees from the selected suppliers to support the
improvements offered. The gas turbine upgrades consist of technological advances made
since the original design of the machines. In order to protect JIPS's interests, the
performance predictions proposed should be supported by performance guarantees. The
environmental measures proposed are all addressable using established technology. In the
case of the telecommunication and energy management system improvements, this
component is subject to rapid technological advances and can be rapidly outdated.
However, such systems are frequently used in utility systems based on a life span which
reflects the advances of technology.
4.71  The preferred approach to dealing with Old Harbour Unit 4 is based on the
technical and schedule advantages which are part of dealing with the original supplier. The
original supplier can re-utilize the existing boiler drums which yields a schedule advantage
of about 6 months over selecting a new supplier; adding this to the estimated minimum
time of 4 months to tender and award an international competitive bid, shows a significant
advantage in favor of the negotiated contract approach. However, to complement this
schedule, it is necessary to complete the turbine-generator works in the same time frame.
There is some risk that this may not be readily achievable. The other components are
considered to have a low risk due to the flexibility of the implementation timing.
4.72  The organization and management risks to the project components are considered
to be low due to the proposed project implementation groups' experience and the use of
internationally experienced consultants and advisors.

5. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. General
5.1   The economic analysis encompasses the following project components: the
Restoration and Life Extension of Old Harbour Unit 4 and the improvement to
telecommunications and EMS.
5.2   Two modes of economic analysis were used for economic evaluation:
* A least cost analysis which indicates that the project is the most economical
alternative for providing service; and
* A justification of the project per se, whereby the benefits are quantified by
contrasting the scenario with the project and the scenario without the project; the
difference in costs between the two scenarios provides the benefits of the project
and allows the evaluation of its internal rate of return.
5.3   The least cost analysis was performed in two stages:
* in a first-cut approximation, a static screening analysis shows the desirability of the
rehabilitation of Old Harbour Unit 4; and
*  a second stage consists of verifying that the project component is part of the
system's least cost generation expansion plan.
B. Screening Analysis
5.4   Restoration and Life Extension of Old Harbour Unit 4. The estimated total
project cost, for a July 1995 commissioning date, amounts to US$31 million. The
remaining useful life of the unit after life extension work is completed is expected to be
fifteen years. Fuel costs, in a first approximation, are expected to be on the order of
$15/bbl and the unit's heat rate is assumed to be 12,50OBtuIkWh, which corresponds to
the unit's efficiency before the explosion; the installation of a new boiler and life
extension work are expected to improve it.
5.5   In a first approximation, the cost involved in rehabilitating Unit No. 4 is compared
to the costs of Medium Speed Diesel (MSD) units, Slow Speed Diesel (SSD) units, new
Oil/Steam (OS) and Combined Cycle (CC) plants. The comparative characteristics of
these plants are summarized in the following table:

5.6     A screening analysis shows that the rehabilitation of Old Harbour unit 4 enjoys a
large advantage in investment costs. The lowest capital cost competitor in terms of $/kW,
the combined cycle units, have the disadvantage of high fuel costs due to their use of
diesel fuel. In order to compare the various types and sizes of units on a comparable
basis, the unit generating cost for each is calculated. Table 8 gives a summary of the data,
assumptions and results of the calculations. It is evident that the rehabilitation of Old
Harbour unit 4 is the preferred alternative.

5.7     The costs and operating parameters from Table 7 are applied to an assumed base
load operation for each type of unit, recognizing that base load operation would be at a
85% net capacity factor, after deducting allowances for planned and forced outages. The
next best alternative under this analysis is the new oil-fired steam unit which requires more
than double the initial capital investment. The capital cost of Old Harbour unit 4 would
have to be approximately 100% higher (i.e. over $60 million) for a new steam unit to be
more attractive.
C. Least Cost Generation Expansion Plan
5.8     The second approach verifies that the projects are included in JPS' Least Cost
Generation Expansion Program (LCGEP) . The LCGEP optimization is carried out using
the WASP III model to simulate annual investment and operating costs over the
generation planning period. The net present value of these annual expenditures is



- 37 -
compared for a complete range of candidate generating plant options and expansion
sequences. The expansion sequence with the lowest net present value is chosen as the
LCGEP.
5.9   During appraisal JPS was asked to run additional generation simulations, utilizing
the latest information available on project costs, timing and fuel price forecasts. The costs
for committed and proposed privately owned power generation projects and their latest
on-line schedules were also applied to the runs.
5.10  The prices for Bunker C and diesel fuel used in the least cost analysis are based on
current world market prices of crude oil, the Bank's latest (June 1994) projections of
energy price changes and JPS' recent experience with the differentials between Bunker C
and diesel fuel delivered prices. These prices are adjusted to remove all duties, subsidies
and taxes which may be included in the actual cost of fuel. Coal prices are also based on
world market prices with an allowance for delivery to plant site and escalation according
to the Bank's projections.
5.11  Alternatives considered in the LCGEP included low and medium speed diesel
units, combined cycle units, simple cycle gas turbines as well as coal and oil fired steam
plants. A 10 MW wind farm is included in the plan on a test program basis.
5.12  The simulation runs were made for a study period of 1995 through 2013 and the
results confirm that the rehabilitation of Old Harbour Unit 4 and the repowering of the
three Gas Turbines are part of the least cost expansion sequence. This result is not
changed in the case of high or low demand forecasts or variation of the assumed discount
rate.
5.13  Since both projects involve short lead times, there are relatively few alternatives
that can be put in place within the same time frame; consequently the delay in getting low
cost base load and peaking plants commissioned has a significant impact on annual fuel
costs. This effect is in addition to the fact that both projects involve extending the
operating lives of generation resources for less than one half the cost of equivalent new
capacity (as confirmed by the screening analysis).
5.14  The least cost expansion sequence is as follows:
1994  Rehabilitation of OH Unit 3 (55MW MCR); and
60 MW Emergency Capacity (20MW Steam and 40MW GT units power
purchase agreements for 3 years)
1995  Rehabilitation and Life Extension of OH Unit 4 (68.5MW)
Repowering of GT Nos. 3, 4 & 5 (63MW)
72 MW Medium Speed Diesel Private Barge



- 38 -
1996 60 MW Low Speed Diesel - Private Project
1997  10 MW Test Wind Farm
1998  60 MW Base Load
Renew 40MW Emergency Capacity contract (GT plant)
2000  60 MW Base Load
2002  3 x 80 MW Coal-Fired Station
5.15  The estimated cost of the LCGEP is US$2,082 million at 1995 price levels. The
least cost plan aims for an addition of a total net capacity of 428MW between 1994 and
2001 (excluding the coal plant) to the existing 444MW MCR after the explosion; load
growth during this period is expected to amount to around 180MW. However, during the
same period, 155MW are scheduled for retirement, including steam and gas turbine units.
Therefore the expansion program reflects the fact that many of JPS' units are close to, or
have exceeded, their economic life; given the current performance of these units there is
no avoiding the immediacy of the massive replacement requirement that now confronts the
company. Under these circumstances, the proposed expansion program reasonably
addresses the need for new capacity requirements.
5.16  As a check on the desirability of rehabilitating Old Harbour Unit 4, an alternative
was run in which Old Harbour Unit 4 is not considered as an option within the plan. The
alternative plan produced by WASP in effect replaces Old Harbour Unit 4 by a new steam
unit in 1999. The corresponding net present value cost amounts to US$2,091 million.
The rehabilitation of Old Harbour Unit 4 therefore provides a cost reduction on the order
of US$9 million against the next best plan.
D. Economic Analysis
5.17  The final mode of analysis involves a determination of the net benefits of each
identified project component and calculation of the benefit-cost ratio. The benefits
accruing to the project are considered to be represented by the additional costs incurred
over the planning period for the case in which the project is omitted from the expansion
sequence. The sum of the present values of the annual benefits is then divided by the
present value of the project investment costs to determine the benefit-cost ratio for the
project. In addition the Economic Internal Rate of Return is calculated as the discount
rate which equates the present value of the costs to the present value of the benefits for
the project.
5.18  Old Harbour Unit 4. The economic analysis of the restoration and life extension
of unit number 4 at Old Harbour Power Station assumes a total project cost, for a July



- 39 -
1995 commissioning date, of $31 million and a remaining useful service life of fifteen
years. This cost excludes price contingency and financing (IDC) costs.
5.19  For the operation of the system without OH Unit 4 the projections assume that the
capacity and energy contributed by this unit will be made up from other existing units and,
when these are not sufficient, through a decrease in reliability on the system (increase in
unserved energy). Moreover, if the unit is not rehabilitated, the insurance payment is
expected to amount to no more than the book value of the damaged components,
estimated at US$5 million, against an expected recovery on the order of US$22.5 million
if the unit is rehabilitated. The results yield a benefit-cost ratio of 1.92 for a discount rate
of 10% and a corresponding EIRR of 30.8%.
5.20  Sensitivity Results. The sensitivity of the results of the analysis to changes in
key variables was tested. The variables selected included the economic value of unserved
energy, the discount rate, the capital cost and the fuel costs. In the case of fuel costs, the
impact of adjusting the price differential between Bunker C (3% sulfur) and Diesel to
reflect the historical world market relationship is also presented. An additional sensitivity
case assumes that if Old Harbour unit number 4 is not repaired, the insurance settlement
will only amount to book value of the boiler and other damaged equipment. For purposes
of this analysis, the book value figure is taken to be US$ 5 million. The results are shown
below:

5.21  Telecommunication and Energy Management System. The EMS project
component capital cost is estimated to be $8.1 million, with implementation proposed for
October, 1997. The benefits of the project include an assumed reduction in fuel costs of
2% per year due to more efficient and effective dispatch of units as well as a reduction of
10% in unserved energy. The period of analysis is taken as fifteen years, although a
shorter period is considered in the sensitivity testing. The economic analysis compares the



- 40 -
initial cost of the system with the sum of the annual benefits identified above. The results
show an EIRR of 20.4% and a Benefit/ Cost ratio of 1.82. The chosen sensitivity
parameters and their impact on project economics are shown below:

6. JPS ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCES
A. Organization and Management5
6.1    Organization. Annex 6.1 shows JPS's current organizational structure. At
present the generation division (Gendiv) appears within JPS, albeit with its own financial
controller, financial administration and purchasing functions. However, this is a temporary
step towards implementing JPS' reorganization in preparation for privatization.
6.2    The background studies for the reorganization have been conducted as part of the
Operations Audit Study (Peat Marwick, 1991) and the sector restructuring studies
(Coopers & Lybrand, 1992/93). The latter were conducted within the Energy Sector
Deregulation and Privatization Project (Loan 3502-JM). The restructuring of JPS is
supported by rDB. Although Coopers & Lybrand's studies recommended JPS
unbundling into two companies, in charge of generation and transmission and distribution,
the Government is analyzing other alternatives.
6.3    The Office of Utility Regulation Act 1995 has been passed by the Parliament.
Consultant to assist the government to establish the Office of Utility Regulator has been
appointed. The establishment of the OUR is supported by IDB's Multi-lateral Investment
Fund (MIF) grant facility. Government has already announced its intention to privatize
JPS and invited international companies to submit applications for prequalification.
6.4   JPS has recently established an efficiency review task force to improve JPS
management and operations. Areas for improvement are: (a) organizational structure and
consolidation; (b) customer services and quality of service; (c) metering billing and
collections; d) re-engineering key processors. Recommendations from the Taskforce will
be incorporated in the corporate action plan, to be reviewed by the Bank. As a result of
recommendations of this task force, JPS has eliminated 371 positions. As a first step to
improve metering, a pilot computerized meter reading program would be implemented
before the final corporate information system is put in place (Cooper & Lybrand, January
1995 study financed under Power IV Project).
6.5    Staffing. In FY94/95, JPS had a staff of 2,375 contract and permanent
employees (there are also about 525 temporaries6). Based on 370,577 customers reported
for the July/September 1994 quarter, this yields an index of 158 customers/employee (6.3
employees per 1000 accounts). This index is below the international standards which are
in excess of 160 customers/employee in reasonably managed enterprises.
Since the completion of appraisal in December 1994, JPS has undertaken a major restructuring to implement the
recommendations of the Efficiency Task Force. This restructuring will be reflected in the updated Corporate Action
Plan.
6 The term "employees" refers only to the contracted and permanent staff.



- 42 -
6.6   JPS staffing has been increasing in the past three years: In 1992/93 there were
2,022 employees and around 237,300 customers, yielding an index of 167 customers per
employee. According to current plans, the staffing level is expected to decline to 1,993 by
FY1999/2000. With an expected number of customers by the end of the decade of around
424,400, the ratio of customers/employee would increase to 213, a good index (Annex
6.11).
6.7   Accounting, Financial Reporting and Auditing. JPS is in compliance with
requirements concerning audited financial statements. According to external auditors,
proper accounting records have been maintained, and financial statements comply with the
provisions of the Companies Act and give a true and fair view of the state of the
company's affairs.
6.8   The project entity will continue to maintain its accounting system in accordance
with sound and internationally recognized accounting principles and practices acceptable
to the Bank to provide interim financial reports and annual financial statements that reflect
the financial performance and position of the project and the project entity, from the
commencement of project execution. An auditor's opinion and reports satisfactory to the
Bank on such statements will be provided within six months of the close of the fiscal year.
The auditor's report will include a statement on the adequacy or otherwise of the
accounting system and internal controls, the reliability of statements of expenditures as a
basis for loan disbursements, and compliance with financial covenants. The foregoing
project accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements should provide
adequate and timely information to the Bank for supervision of the project.
B. Financial Analysis
6.9   Introduction. JPS' financial affairs are governed by the Electricity Development
Act which allows the company to charge a rate that would cover operating costs,
including depreciation and debt service, and to set aside funds for expansions, extensions
and others alike. Under the Fourth Power Project, the World Bank financed a study to
review the tariff structure. Following this study, in December 1991, the GOJ approved a
mechanism to allow JPS to introduce an automatic adjustments clause to recover changes
in exchange rates and foreign costs (amounting to 75% of total JPS revenue
requirements). Rate calculations provide for fuel cost adjustments every six months.
These adjustments have to be approved by the MPUT. Fourth Power Project had
covenanted that JPS commission a long run marginal cost (LRMC) study to be used as a
basis for restructuring tariffs.
6.10 Following a policy decision by GOJ that Jamaica would acquire all new power
generation capacity through the private sector (BOO schemes), in 1992 the World Bank
approved the ESDPP loan. A load research program was carried out on a limited sample
and based on these results the Jamaica Power Sector Regulatory Framework and



- 43 -
Privatization Study (January 1993), undertaken by Coopers & Lybrand, prepared a
prelimninary LRMC. The consultants concluded that JPS' tariffs, on average, were about
15% higher than the long run marginal cost. However, it recognized that the sample base
was limited and required a further detailed and wider sample. The study recommended
that once the extensive load research program is completed, a detailed LRMC should be
commissioned and used as basis for establishing new tariff structure. The load research
program is currently underway and is expected to be completed by July, 1995. Following
the completion of this program, a detailed LRMC will be commissioned under the
proposed project (paras 3.20 and 7.1 a) and completed by March 31, 1996.
6.11  Past Financial Performance. The appraisal mission reviewed the financial
covenants agreed under the Bank's Power Four and ESDPP projects and found JPS to be
in general compliance except that JPS' receivables from the NWC and other public sector
entities are still more than 60 days billing; and JPS' RoR is below covenanted 8%. The
appraisal mission also reviewed the five year Corporate Action Plan (CAP) which was last
updated in March 1994. A negotiations JPS presented its updated preliminary Action Plan
showing the steps which are being taken to improve RoR to 8% by FY96/97 and bring
receivables from NWC and other public sector entities to below 60 days. The Ministry of
Finance and Planning (MOFP) has assumed the NWC's debt, while NWC remains current
on regular billings. MOFP has also undertaken to issue warrants to other public sector
entities and ministries which will enable them to remain current. The government has
implemented measures which have brought down the overall public sector overdue payments
from 151 days in June, 1995, to 31 days in July, 1995; comprising one day for NWC and 61
days for the rest of the government. Although, following the explosion in June 1994, JPS
had to make adjustments in the targets established in the CAP, it was able to achieve a
number of original targets. Table 11 shows a comparison of CAP's original targets and
JPS' performance during past 11 months.

6.12  Major constraints on the company's performance during FY94/95 and FY95/96
are: (a) June 1994 explosion, causing island wide power outages and as a result reducing



- 44 -
sales; (b) increased fuel costs due to higher use of gas turbines, while a decision was taken
that increased fuel cost will not be passed on to the consumers and would await the
settlement of insurance claim for consequential losses; (c) delays in settlement of insurance
claims; (d) increase in 0 & M expenses to restore the reliability of generation system; and
(e) initial recommendations of an independent Tariff Review Committee that JPS should
review and reduce its operating costs and improve the financial performance rather than
receive an outright increase in its base tariffs.
6.13  Following a review of its financial and operating position, JPS had set up an
Efficiency Review Taskforce (ERT) to examine cost containment measures, organizational
structure, number of employees and other opportunities to improve efficiency. The
Taskforce completed its work in April 1995. Following this, JPS is implementing its
recommendations and will update the CAP accordingly. In the meanwhile, JPS has
prepared a monitorable summary CAP for the period 1995-2000. The key objectives of
this plan are: (a) restore the lost generation capacity to normal conditions by August
1995; (b) improve system reliability by improving the energy control system and
reinforcing the transmission network to reduce the likelihood of future recurrence of
generating plant incidents; (c) continue with the restructuring of the company for
privatization; (d) maintain tariffs levels to obtain a 8% RoR on average revalued fixed
assets; (e) complete the long run marginal cost study based on the results of the load
research program and develop special tariff for select groups such as National Water
Commission; (f) review corporate organization and staffing aimed at cost containment
and management efficiency and establish targets to be achieved under the updated CAP to
be completed by August 30, 1995; (g) conduct a pilot computerized meter reading
program; (h) develop and implement the financial medium and long range planning
component in the Integrated Resource Planning Model; (i) conduct benchmark Customer
Satisfaction Survey once every two years; () initiate environmental mitigation plans and
develop relevant targets to be incorporated in the CAP; (k) implement the demand side
management programs; and (1) continue to reap the benefits of the fuel procurement
strategies which have recently been implemented
6.14  Income statements showing JPS' financial results for the period FY91 through
FY94 and estimated results for FY95 (based on 11 months actuals) are presented in Annex

6.19   Overall JPS' financial position has been heavily influenced by the effects of
exchange rate movements of the Jamaican dollar and also the impact of local and foreign
inflation. Local inflation moved from 105% in 1991/92 to an estimated out turn of some
24.9% in 1994/95. The Jamaican dollar moved from J$ 7.9 per US$ in FY91 to J$ 33.3
per US$ in FY95, thereby resulting in a sharp increase in the net fixed asset base.
Working capital representing the excess of current assets over current liabilities also grew
during this period with current ratio fluctuating between 1 .1 and 1.9. During this period
JPS was able to fund its operations substantially from internal sources thereby limiting its
need to resort to long-term borrowings. With expected stabilization in the J$,
improvements in the operational efficiency and the implementation of its Corporate Action
Plan 1995/2000, JPS is expected to improve its financial position in line with projections
presented in Annex 6.2 to 6.4.
6.20   Capital Expenditure. JPS' capital expenditure program for FY95 - FY99
assumes: (a) all future generation investments, except hydroelectric power plants, would
be undertaken by the private sector; and (b) the expansion and improvement of the
transmission and distribution systems as well as rehabilitation of existing plants and
implementation of ongoing projects will be carried out by JPS. The program which is
based on projected exchange rates (Annex 6.2) is within the overall public sector
investment program (PSIP) which has been submitted to MPUT and the Ministry of
Finance, and forms the part of PSIP to be agreed between GOJ and IMF for FY96. The
investment program for the five years is estimated at J$ 13.8 billion or US$ 392 million in
constant terms and J$ 14.6 billion (US$ 416 million) in nominal terms. Of this, foreign
component is about 68%. The investment program is detailed in Annex 6.10 and
summarized in Table 15 below.

6.26  The above financial projections are based on the set of assumptions contained in
Annex 6.13 and 6.14. The overriding aspect of these projections is the contribution of
purchased power which increases from 5% in FY95 to 16% in FY96 and 66% in FY2000.
An application has been made to the government to have all purchased power cost
included in the fuel charge which would now be described as fuel and purchased power
cost and would be directly passed on to the consumer. The average price of the fuel is
based on the weighted mix of fuels, adjusted in line with projected increase in international
price of fuels during the period. For FY95/96 an increase of 13.4% in base tariffs is
assumed to be effective from the beginning of the year. However, it is likely that the tariff
increase will only be effective from the middle of the fiscal year. If this should occur, the
operating revenues for FY95/96 would fall by about 3% and the rate of return would be
about 4.2% instead of 6% shown above.7 Total operating revenues also include J$323
milion excess funds recovered from consumers in previous years as a result of the
application of the fuel adjustment clause. This is expected to partially compensate for the
delay in tariff adjustment.
6.27  Funding. Table 19 sets out the projected funding plan for JPS' investment
program over the period FY95-FY2000.
7As a consequence of a delay in effecting an 8.8% tariff increase for FY95/96, the operating margin
would also drop to 7.8% from 10.9%; and return on equity will be about 2% instead of 2.8%, as shown in
Annex 6-12.

6.28  The above financing plan shows the high level of capital expenditure to be
undertaken by JPS over the next five years will be funded increasingly from internal
resources after meeting debt service obligations and working capital requirements. New
borrowings are linked directly with foreign exchange requirements and the level of capital
expenditures funded internally ranges between 45% in FY97 to 86% in FY98.
6.29  Financial Position. Detailed projected balance sheets, for the years FY96-
FY2000, are presented in Annex 6.3 and summarized in Table 20 below.

6.30  The most significant features of the projected balance sheets are the reduction in
debt/equity ratios from 0.4 in FY96 to 0.3 in FY2000 and growth in liquidity over the
projection period. The reduction is driven by both enhanced profitability and additions to
capital reserve arising from fixed assets revaluation. The above projections assume that
GOJ would continue to allow JPS to automatically adjust its tariffs to pass all fuel and
purchased power cost to the consumer, thus maintaining the level of unit base tariffs at
present level in US dollar terms. A full set of key financial indicators is shown in Annex
6.11 and 6.12.

JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE
Generation Recovery And Improvement Project Description
Background
On June 3rd, 1994 the Jamaica Public Service Company Ltd. (JPS) suffered a significant
reduction to its power generating capacity due to an explosion and fire at the Old Harbour Power
Station. The explosion resulted in a complete loss of the unit number 4 boiler and associated
auxiliaries and substantial damage to the boiler of unit number 3. Further, a substantial part of the
unit number 4 electrical equipment and cabling were burned and neighbouring buildings were
destroyed or severely damaged. The incident has resulted in a total reduction of 124 MW from
the total available capacity of 569 MW prior to the incident.
As a result of the above JPS reserve margin has dropped from 49% down to 17% causing
severe system unreliability. JPS is presently taking steps to restore its generating capacity back to
an acceptable level. Among several steps to be taken is the repair and rehabilitation of the Unit
number 3 boiler and the procurement and installation of a replacement boiler to be used with the
existing 68 MW turbine set at the Old Harbour Power Station Unit Number 4. In addition, this
project will include the replacement of all electric equipment, cabling, instrumentation and switch
gear, control building, chemical laboratory and stores buildings which were damaged during the
explosion. JPS will also be pursuing a life extension programme for the Unit number 4 turbine
generator set and associated auxiliary systems to enable the unit to be operable for a further 20 to
30 years. Unit number 3 at the Old Harbour Power Station is scheduled to be back in operation
by February 1995 and the restoration programme is expected to be completed in the third quarter
of 1995.
In addition to the recovery and life extension programs on the Old Harbour Power Station
following the incident, a generation improvement programme will be carried out to improve the
efficiency and availability of the power production capacity operated by JPS. The generation
improvements programme is expected to be completed by end of 1996.
The Project Components
The proposed Project consists of eight major components as follows:
*  Restoration of Old Harbour Unit Number 3;
*  Restoration of Old Harbour Unit Number 4;
*  Life Extension of Old Harbour Unit Number 4;
*  Gas Turbines 3, 4 and 5 Upgrade;
*  Telecommunication and Energy Management Systems Improvement;
*  Transmission and Substations Reinforcements
*  Environmental Mitigation Measures at the Old Harbour Power Station and
Other Sites;



- 65 -
Consultancy Services; and Technical Assistance.
Restoration of Old Harbour Unit number 3
This project component comprises repair of the damage to OH unit number 3 boiler
caused by the incident. In addition, this component includes rehabilitation work on unit number 3
boiler and turbine. The materials being used for the rehabilitation of unit number 3 were originally
provided as part of a contract which JPS had in-place for a planned rehabilitation of unit number 4
but the June explosion of Unit number 4 and its subsequent replacement enabled JPS to utilise the
materials to expedite the repair of unit number 3. In addition, materials on-site and planned for
rehabilitation work on unit number 4, enabled JPS to redirect the rehabilitation work to unit
number 3.
Restoration of Old Harbour Unit Number 4
This project component will include works and equipment deliveries to be provided for a
full restoration of the Unit number 4 steam generating facilities including the control building,
chemical laboratory and stores destroyed by the explosion on June 3, 1994.
The restoration of Unit number 4 steam generating facilities will include the following
scope of supply:
*  Site clearance;
*  Delivery and installation of a complete new boiler incl. fans, air pre-heaters and
flue gas ducts;
* Delivery and installation of fuel handling and burning systems;
e  Replacement of the main steam, boiler feedwater and auxiliary piping systems;
Delivery and installation of new instrumentation and control systems to the
latest standards;
*  Delivery and installation of complete new electrical equipment and cabling
systems as required for the restoration of the unit;
*  Repair of the stack;
*  Replacement of auxiliary systems as required following the explosion and fire;
Reconstruction of the plant stores building and services;
* Reconstruction of the plant chemical laboratory and resupply of laboratory
equipment;
*  Replacement of turbine hall crane rail beam; and
* Miscellaneous other systems and services replacement.
An examination of the existing drums has been conducted by the original boiler supplier;
the report covering the extent of this work and the methodology used was not available for review
by the mission. Visual examination of the drums showed some tube plate erosion assumed to be a
result of tube leaks and some surface damage assumed to be a result of the incident; the areas seen
are considered repairable. The original boiler supplier has proposed to restore the drums to a state
of full compliance with the ASME Boiler Code for re-use in the replacement boiler. This approach



- 66 -
avoids the delays associated with delivery of new drums which would be necessary if another
boiler supplier were to be involved.
Life Extension of OH Unit Number 4
This project component includes works and deliverables to be provided for the restoration
and life extension program for the unit number 4 turbine-generating facilities. Such proposed
works and deliverables are mainly related to equipment and systems not renewed and/or replaced
as a consequence of the explosion.
In addition to the proposed rebuild of unit number 4, a life extension program of the unit
number 4 steam turbine generating facilities is proposed. The program comprises the following
items:
* Life extension of the turbine and generator set. A proposal for this work was submit-
ted on September 30th, 1994 by the turbine manufacturer GE Intemational Power
Systems. This proposal includes the items considered necessary by GE, the original
supplier, for the life extension;
* Overhaul and upgrade of turbine auxiliary systems;
* Repair of steam air ejectors;
* Modifications to the cooling water piping and valve installations;
* Replacement of the condenser water boxes;
* Installation of duplex filters and a ball tube cleaning system in the cooling water
system; and
* Installation of a cathodic protection system for the condenser and CW cooling water
screen systems.
Gas Turbines 3, 4 and 5 Upgrade
This project component comprises restoration and life extension of the three Frame 5
General Electric gas turbines, identified as Hunts Bay Units 4, 5 and Bogue Unit 3, each of which
has a name plate output of 22.8 MW and a continuous maximum output of 20 MW. These gas
turbines are configured as simple cycle units with a heat rates as shown below. The units were
installed 1973 and 1974 and were scheduled to be decommissioned in 1997 and 1998.
The units have been operated as peak load capacity with a total operating hours of
approx. 36000 to 40000 for the Hunts Bay units and 45000 hours for the unit at Bogue. As a
result of the loss of generating capacity at Old Harbour, the units have been operated at higher
load factors.
The objective of the proposed project component is to replace existing parts of the gas
turbines with new and modem equipment in order to improve the unit efficiency, to increase the
reliability and extend the technical life time at least 10 years. Upgrade and life extension programs
on existing plant are increasingly a common practice in the utility industry due to the capital cost
of new plant and the problems associated with siting of new facilities. Upgrading of existing plant



- 67 -
also permits utilities to incorporate the benefits of the ongoing research and development work
undertaken by the equipment manufacturer.
In order to ensure the success of such programs, it is common practice in the industry to
negotiate a contract with the original designer/manufacturer of the plant because of the risk of
failure to meet expectations involved with trying to incorporate components from other suppliers.
The replacement program for existing parts with advanced technology components will include
items such as:
* The supply and installation of a Hot Gas Path Advanced Technology package as
developed by the original plant designer/manufacturer; and
* The provision of a modernisation package to include:
- new control system using microprocessor based technology,
- new compressor blades, vanes and bleed valves,
- new fuel system,
- modified bearing design,
- extended exhaust thermocouple.
The anticipated performance improvements are as follows:
Heat Rate (BTU/kWh)         Output (kW)
Power Plant          Before         After        Before   After
Bogue Unit 3          16,400         15,621      20,000   21,064
Hunts' Bay Unit 4     17,460         15,621      20,000   21,064
Hunts' Bay Unit 5     15,994         15,621      20,000   21,064
Transmission and Substations Reinforcements
To accommodate the scheduled addition of 72MW of new generating capacity at Old Harbour
(WartsilalJamaica Energy Partners barge), against the background of the restoration of units 3 and 4, it
is necessaiy to provide reinforcements to the transmission system to assure the interconnection of this
new facility and the reliable transmission of power from Old Harbour. The proposed reinforcements
consist of:
* Construction of 32km of 138kV lines between Pamassus and Spur Tree with attendant
substation facilities for interconnection;
* Construction of 16km of 138kV lines between Spur Tree and Kendal with attendant
substation facilities; and
* Substation expansion to accommodate the Wartsila/JEP 72MW barge

Telecommunication and Energy Management System Improvement
Existing Energy Management System (EMS). The existing EMS was supplied by Harris
Corporation in 1985 using early 1980's technology. The System is old and nearing the end of its useful
life. It can not meet JPS current and near future needs and operational requirements. The System has
several deficiencies some of which include: outdated computer equipment (thus, lack of vendor
support), essential application software not operational, inconsistent and inaccurate alarms, outdated
user interface, no capability to interface with other departments, and cumbersome maintenance support
tools. In addition, due to turnover in staff, the new programming staff have received little formal
training on the computer system - some training is no longer offered by the supplier. The manuals are
ineffective and very cumbersome to use. These deficiencies cannot be overcome cost effectively.
Existing Telecommunication System (TCS). The transmission network is comprised of
analogue microwave radio which spans five major repeater stations originating and terminating at
Catherine's Peak repeater station. Spur and radial links in conjunction with power line carrier
equipment complete the connections to the substations and administrative offices. The frequency
bands used are 960 Mhz and 1.5 GHz, with a maximum equipped capacity of 72 channels. The
equipment is over 10 years old.
The existing system has various problems, among them we can mention the following:
* High Fault Rates
*  Obsolete Equipment
* Unreliable/Inadequate PLC Equipment
*  Insecure Network Arrangement
*  Insufficient Standby Radio Links
*  Low Channel Capacity
*  No Expansion Capability
*  Lack of Communication Control Facility
*  Dependence on Public Telecommunications Company
Proposed Expansion of the EM System. The acquisition of a modern Energy Management
System base on an open system architecture is recommended. The functions envisioned for the JPS
Energy Management System include: SCADA, Generation Control, Power System Network
Security Analysis, Historical Information System, Energy Accounting, Generation Scheduling, Load
Shedding, Operator Training Simulator, Full Graphics User Interface, and the necessary support
functions. Each function above consists of several application programs.
The procurement of this system can help JPS achieve higher operational efficiency and realize
improved system reliability and substantial fuel savings immediately. In addition, in light of potential
reform and restructuring of the Power Industry within Jamaica, the new EMS as envisioned above, will
place JPS Systems Control in an excellent position to serve the needs of the reformed industry.



- 69 -
Proposed New TC System. It is proposed to implement, on a supply and supervision of
installation basis, a digital network consisting of a microwave backbone radio, fractional rate UHF
digital radios and the necessary multiplex and auxiliary equipment.
This new telecommunication system has as the primary objective, the provision of
* High quality transmission channels
* High bandwidth capacity
* High service reliability
* New diversified network
*  A management control center
Environmental Mitigation Measures
This component of the project comprises the implementation of measures recommended in this
and previous reports. These measures include:
* provision of a waste water treatment plant at Old Harbour Power Station
i oil spillage containment measures
remediation of contaminated soils
- redirection of regeneration effluent from the water treatment plant
3 laboratory upgrading
Other measures recommended in this and previous environmental reports (such as improved
boiler controls and stack emissions monitoring and on-line condenser tube cleaning) are included in the
project component for Old Harbour unit number 4. A detailed discussion of the environmental issues is
presented in Annex 4.3.

GENERATION RECOVERY AND IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Environmental Issues and Mitigation Action Plan
Legal, Institutional, and Policy Framework
In June of 1991, following the passage of enabling legislation, the GOJ established the
National Resource Conservation Authority (NRCA) as the principle agency responsible for the
effective management of the environment. Its functions cover management and policy aspects
relating to wildlife, watersheds, coastal zone protection, national parks, including survey and
investigative work. Of particular relevance to the energy sector, NRCA has the responsibility to:
-  require EIA's;
-  order the cessation of pollution;
-  require develop, implement, and monitor environmental protection programs;
*  formulate standards and codes of practice including those relating to emissions and
effluents;
*  investigate the effect on the environment of polluting activities and take appropriate
action;
*  commission studies and promote relevant research;
*  introduce training programs;
*  do anything which in the opinion of NRCA is necessary to perform its functions; and
* industries to monitor and report pollutant discharges; and restore polluted areas to
there original condition.
The NRCA will be developing these activities in conjunction with the various sector
agencies; and an energy / environmental steering committee has been formed to look at the broad
range of environmental issues facing the energy sector. The energy sector plans are to include:
*  a mandatory EIA for new energy projects;
*  cleaning up existing pollution sources, priorities being JPS and the Petrojam refinery;
*  pollution abatement by energy conservation and efficiency improvement;
*  strengthening NRCA to fulfill its mandate;
*  establishing baseline data for air quality and forestry resources;
*  identifying standards for zones such as Kingston, tourist areas etc.
NGO's have been formed and are active in environmental issues. The University of West
Indies are doing environmental research and the Ministry of Health has been doing air quality
monitoring studies.



- 72 -
Environmental Issues
During the preparation of the Energy Sector Deregulation and Privatization (ESDP,
Loan 3502-JM) environmental impact assessments (EIA)'s were completed for new generation
capacity being added at Hunt's Bay and Rockfort. Based on the recommendations of these
studies, JPS established a mitigation action plan for Hunt's Bay. The action plan included
measures to control and monitor: SO2 emissions; chemical waste and hazardous waste
management; site remediation and liquid effluent monitoring; and an air monitoring program. JPS
have been assisted in the implementation by Geomatrix Inc. (US consultant ) and; by Conrad
Douglas & Associates (Jamaican) and Kolbusch and Partners Ltd. (Jamaican). The mitigation
requirements of that program are expected to be complete by mid 1995.
Recently JPS contracted with Fichtner (a German consultant ) to complete an EIA for the
Old Harbour power plant and this was completed in March 1994, prior to the loss of Unit 4. The
recommendations of that report included: a waste water treatment plant; oil spillage containment;
remediation of contaminated soils; on-line condenser cleaning; improved boiler instrumentation
and controls; use of the existing neutralization plant for regeneration wastes from the
demineralization plant; and laboratory upgrading.
The restoration of OH Unit 4 will occur at the same time that a new 72MW medium speed
diesel barge facility is to be installed at the Old Harbour Plant. The barge facility is being
developed by Jamaica Energy Partners who have an agreement to provide power to JPS for 20
years commencing September 1995. It will be independent of the existing plant but will discharge
cooling water into the existing cooling water canal. The EIA of the existing steam plant,
previously completed for JPS by Fichtner did not consider the barge facility. A separate EIA is
being prepared by Dynalytics Corporation (a US consultant) for the developer of the barge
facility but this also does not consider the combined impacts of the existing plant. The NRCA
agrees with WB that the EIA for the barge should include impacts from the existing power plant.
The barge facility will discharge cooling water to the existing condenser cooling canal.
The impacts of the combined thermal plume will be modeled as part of the EIA for the barge.
The barge will require dredging of an estimated 200,000 cubic meters of material to provide a
basin of sufficient depth adjacent to the plant. The dredged materials will be transported to a
designated dump site at sea. No dredging will be done in the area of the coral reefs. Fuel will be
delivered via an undersea pipeline from an offshore tanker mooring; to prevent impacts from spills
a contingency plan will be required.
The existing steam plant at Old Harbour exceeds the WB and NRCA guidelines for
ambient levels of sulphur dioxide due to the low stack heights and the fuel being used. The
addition of control measures, such as increased stack height, to the new unit 4 boiler will not
bring the plant into compliance. With unit 4 shut down, and the other three units operating, the
maximum SO2 levels are approximately 500% and 180% of the WB and NRCA ambient (24 hour)
guidelines respectively. The point of maximum impact is approximately 500m west of the station,
an area of low habitation. The incremental increase in sulphur dioxide from the barge facility is



- 73 -
marginal. The retirement of Units 1 and 2 in 1998/9 will greatly improve conditions, but the
guidelines will still be exceeded on occasion, Preliminary information provided on the barge
shows that it will increase NO, levels above WB guidelines. The combined emissions from the
barge and existing plant meet ambient levels for particulate matter. JPS has agreed to develop an
acceptable Mitigation plan by October 31, 1995, to comply with the World Bank standards by
1999 and NRCA standards by 2000.
Waste water discharges from the steam plant also exceed WB guidelines due to the lack
of a treatment plant to handle the air preheater and boiler wash waters. These contain high levels
of heavy metals which are currently discharged untreated to the Caribbean Sea via the cooling
water effluent .
Prior activities at Old Harbour have contaminated the site with fuel oil, in the tank farm
and along the piping route. The oil piping is not contained in trenching along its full route. To
prevent future contamination the tank farm should be contained in an impermeable dyke and the
oil transfer piping installed in an impermeable trench. Contarninated soils at Hunts Bay were
removed and burned in a cement kiln. A secure storage area is required for chemicals and
hazardous wastes. This should include a curbed concrete pad, a rain canopy and fencing.
JPS has commenced a program of environmental stewardship through the mitigation
program underway at Hunts Bay and Rockfort. This requires strengthening through the
establishment of an organizational structure for monitoring environmental performance. This can
be achieved using existing staff resources who have been trained in environmental controls.
An asbestos survey is urgently required, followed by a management plan prior to the start
of construction activities on Unit 4. JPS staff can complete this, as approximately 30 of them
have had asbestos training. A PCB survey and management plan is also required; JPS are
consolidating waste PCB's and negotiating shipment to a destruction facility in France.
Environmental Action Plans
Air emissions: The restoration of Unit 4 will not increase air emissions above those
which existed prior to the loss of the boiler. Improvements in modem controls will have a
positive effect on the emissions from Unit 4. The proposed condenser cleaning system will reduce
fuel consumption thereby reducing overall emissions. The high ambient S02 levels will be
reduced with the planned retirement of unit 1 in 1998 and Unit 2 in 1999. The barge developer is
researching the ratio of NO2 to NO, in the exhaust gas.
Barge facility: As part of the EIA requirement for the barge, the developer will prepare

JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE
GENERATION RECOVERY AND IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Consultancy Services for Environmental Mitigation
Terms of Reference
Introduction
On June 3, 1994 an explosion occurred at the Old Harbour power plant in Jamaica which
destroyed the unit 4 boiler and damaged unit 3. As part of a program to restore the power station
capacity at the Old Harbour power plant, the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) requires the
services of a qualified environmental consulting firm to assist in projects involving the upgrading
of environmental controls. The projects will include studies to identify the extent of the problems,
the design of control measures and assistance with the implementation.
This Terms of Reference gives the background, scope of services, and description of
deliverables required from this project:
Task 1:  Waste water pollution control.
Task 2:  Investigation and design of a site remediation program.
Task 3:  Investigation and design of spill containment measures.
TASK 1: Waste Water Pollution Control
Background. The power station requires a waste water treatment plant to handle the air
preheater wash water which is acidic in nature and contains high levels of dissolved metals and
ash deposits. The treatment plant must also be capable of handling boiler wash water. The treated
effluent must meet World Bank guidelines for thermal power plants and the Jamaican guidelines
for waste water discharges as administered by the National Resource Conservation Authority
(NRCA). Included in the scope of work is the design of a collection system to direct the wastes
from each of the four boilers to the proposed central treatment facility and a treated effluent
sewer.
Scope of work. The consultant will conduct a thorough survey of the power plant to
determine the flows and characteristics of each of the waste water sources to be treated. This
should include the collection of samples over the course of at least one air preheater wash cycle.
Samples should be analyzed and bench tests done to determine the appropriate treatment method.
A survey should also be conducted to provide the basis of design for a collection system
for the wastes from each boiler to the treatment plant and a discharge sewer to the cooling water
canal. As part of this field survey the consultant should liaise with JPS for agreement on the
location of the treatment plant. At least two alternative methods of treatment should be



- 83 -
considered for conceptual design. These will include methods of sludge handling and disposal
options. The consultant will provide JPS with a report describing the treatment alternatives and
recommend the preferred system. The estimated capital and operating cost of each alternative, the
process flow diagrams and equipment lists will be included in the report. The consultant will be
required to make a presentation of the report to JPS.
Following a review of the report and agreement by JPS on the preferred alternative the
consultant will complete the technical specifications for the supply and construction of the
treatment plant. The consultant will provide support to JPS such as design review during the
implementation phase.
TASK 2: Investigation and design of a site remediation program
The power station site has been contaminated by petroleum products. These areas can be
observed within the tank farm and along the oil pipeline corridor. This contamination requires
remediation prior to installing an impermeable spill containment system.
Scope of work. The consultant will conduct a field investigation to determine the extent
of contamination and prepare remedial plans for the decontamination of soil at the plant. If
groundwater impacts are found the remedial plan will assess the need for treatment.
The consultant will first prepare a work plan describing the conditions, a statement of
objectives and plans for the field investigations. The work plan will include a list of analyses to be
performed, a description of the sampling, sample preservation, and analytical methods required.
The work plan will include a health and safety protocol to be followed by the field team.
The consultant will obtain representative samples of soil water and sediments for physical
examination and chemical analyses necessary to fully characterize the extent of contamination.
Sampling and analyses will be performed using methods outlined in the work plan by trained
personnel.
The consultant, in cooperation with JPS will develop the clean up criteria, compatible with
international standards for the contaminated areas of the site. The consultant will then identify
and screen remedial technologies based on the following criteria:
*  Effectiveness: How effective is the selected technology in reducing the pollutant
concentrations to the target levels? Has the technology been commercially proven at
other similar sites? Are there any adverse environmental impacts associated with the
technology?
*  Implementation: Is the remedial technology easily implementable in Jamaica?
*  Costs: Is the technology relatively inexpensive?
For the contaminated areas the consultant will prepare a remedial plan. The plan will
include remedial objectives, identification and screening of remedial technologies and details of
the selected mode of clean up. It will include the description, designs environmental impacts,



- 84 -
monitoring requirements, implementation and disposal. Supporting information such as bases for
cost estimates, preliminary equipment lists and technical information will be appended as
appropriate. Previously petroleum contaminated soil has been excavated and incinerated in a local
cement kiln.
The consultant will provide technical specifications for the remediation to JPS for review
and comment. these will be finalized after receipt of comments.
The consultant will provide technical support to JPS during the implementation phase.
TASK 3: Investigation and design of spill containment measures
Background. A survey of the plant revealed a need to provide or upgrade existing spill
containment facilities. The areas of greatest significance are: the bulk fuel tank storage area
which requires impermeable containment; the oil pipeline corridor which has only partial
containment; and the need for a secure chemical drum storage area.
Scope of work. The consultant will conduct a thorough survey of the site to evaluate the
operating practices which may contribute to spills and the adequacy of the existing spill
containment structures. Some of the current structures are earthen dykes which have been
contaminated by petroleum spills. The extent of the survey will not be limited to those areas
indicated above, but will be more comprehensive. Based on the survey, the consultant will
identify specific areas where spills occur and prescribe measures for preventing and controlling the
discharges. These measures may include improvements of existing designs (e.g. paving of earthen
area with concrete), new designs (e.g. dykes) or changes in operating procedures (e.g. improved
drum and chemical handling methods). The consultant will provide an estimate of cost with each
recommended control measure.
For new or improved containment the consultant will provide designs and specifications
for construction which are compatible with international standards.
The consultant will provide a report of findings with recommendations describing spill
prevention and containment. The report will be presented to JPS.
The consultant will provide JPS with support during the implementation phase.
Deliverables
The consultant will prepare and submit the following deliverable to JPS to cover all three
tasks as described above. Each deliverable will be finalized by the consultant after review and
comment by JPS. The consultant will prepare:
A detailed work plan for the site remediation;
A report for all three tasks including: (i) the waste water treatment plant alternatives
and recommended treatment option; (ii) the remedial action plan for cleaning up the



- 85 -
petroleum contaminated soil, including alternative technologies considered, all
analytical results, borehole and test pit logs, drawings and the work plan; and (iii) the
findings and recommendations of the investigation and design of spill containment
measures;
*  Technical specifications for the supply and construction of the treatment plant;
*  Technical specifications for remediating the site; and
*  Technical specifications for the construction of spill containment.
Scbedule
The schedule for Tasks 1 to 3 will be as follows:
Submission of the remediation work plant:       0.5 months after project start.
Review and comment by JPS:                       1.0 months after project start.

Annex 4-9
JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE
GENERATION RECOVERY AND IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Consultant Services for Cost of Service and Tariff Study
Terms of Reference
Background
The existing tariff schedule is based on a straightforward structure: (i) a Residential
Service (Rate 10) with two energy blocks and a customer fixed charge; (ii) a General Service
(Rate 20) with a flat energy charge and a fixed customer charge; (iii) a Power Service (Rate 40)
with demand and energy charges, a fixed customer charge and a time-of-day option; (iv) a Large
Power Service (Rate 50), applicable to primary service loads and a structure similar to Rate 40;
and (v) a Street Lighting Service (Rate 60) with a flat rate per type of lamp. Credits are provided
for transformer ownership and primary metering. All rates incorporate a fuel adjustment clause
which provides for an automatic (albeit lagged) adjustment according to fuel cost variations, and a
foreign exchange adjustment clause which allows Jamaica Public Service Company Ltd. (JPS) to
recover tariff loss due to exchange rate changes, linked to its foreign currency expenses
(estimated to be on average 75% of its total costs).
Concerning tariff levels, although JPS average tariff level compares favorably with other
countries in the region, Coopers & Lybrand (C&L) performed a preliminary evaluation of long-
run marginal costs as part of the restructuring study. It found that existing average tariffs
exceeded average marginal costs by about 15%. Additionally, the study showed that significant
differences existed between tariffs and marginal cost for individual customer categories, ranging
from +35% for residential customers to -3% for power service. C&L warned that due to the
limited information available on customer load characteristics, results for individual customer
categories should be used cautiously. As part of the Power IV Project (Loan 2869-JM) a load
research program is being carried out in order to determine reliable load composition parameters
which can be used for the assessment and allocation of costs for tariff setting purposes.
In view of the planned changes in the regulatory framework for electricity supply and JPS
privatization process the current electricity pricing system and tariff structure may require
modifications. Especially the following issues need to be addressed: (1) the tariff does not follow
the structure of the costs of future supply; (2) the tariff does not provide customers with adequate
signals for efficient use of electricity in particular since rates do not reflect peak and off peak
supply costs; (3) generation costs are expected to change when JPS is privatized and purchases
from independent power producers increases.



- 87 -
Study Objective
The objective of the tariff study is to provide the Government and JPS with an efficient
pricing system and rate structure for all categories of customers. The rate structure should reflect
the costs of an efficient supply and provide incentives for the efficient use of electricity within the
financial and operating constraints of the JPS and any other electricity supplier.
Additionally, in carrying out the study, the consultant will give the Office of Utility
Regulation (OUR) and JPS staff the opportunity to learn utility ratemaking in practice through
their participation in the tariff study.
Scope of Work
The consultant shall carry out the following:
A.    Analysis of current and future electricity demand
(1)   Analysis of current demand of existing customers including:
- number of customers per block of consumption
- sales per block of consumption
- customer load shapes, seasonality of demand and peak demand
- power factors
- billing frequency analysis

GENERATION RECOVERY AND IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Economic Analysis Methodology
The economic analysis of the two proposed generation projects is carried out in two stages.
The first involves the development of the least cost generation expansion plan over the period covered
by the projects. This is followed by specific analyses of the project costs and benefits to determine
Benefit to Cost Ratios and Economic Internal Rates of Return (EIRR).
The least cost generation expansion plan (LCEP) is developed through use of the WASP IH
simulation program which minimizes annual system operating costs under the expansion parameters,
candidate generating plants and economic assumptions for the system.
JPS has recently carried out economic evaluations for the two projects and presented the
results in a report titled "Economic Justification for the Rehabilitation of Old Harbour Unit No. 4 and
the High Tech Upgrade of Gas Turbines No. 3,4 & 5" dated October 1994. This report is used a
starting point for the economic analysis for the Bank review.
The load forecast used for the evaluation is dated October 1993 and it projects average annual
rates of growth in net generation and peak demand of 5.3% and 5.2% respectively over the period
1993 to 2013. A summary of the forecast is given in Table 1. Other economic assumptions and
candidate plant costs and operating characteristics are listed in Table 2.
In the determination of the LCEP the candidate plants included oil-fired steam, coal/oil- fired
stean, medium speed diesel (MSD), low speed diesel (LSD), simple cycle gas turbine and combined
cycle gas turbine. In addition, a 10 MW test wind farm project was included in the plan. The possible
utilization of the turbo-generator of OH Unit 4 in a combined cycle operation with two gas
turbine/generators was also investigated.
The resulting least cost plan is outlined below along with the scheduled retirements.
1994         60 MW Emergency Capacity for three years
1995         72 MW MSD Barge (comnitted)
Restoration of Old Harbour Unit 3
1996         Rehabilitation of Old Harbour Unit 4
60 MW JPPC LSD (commnitted)
Repowering of Gas Turbines Units 3, 4 & 5
Retire Hunts Bay Units 1, 3, &5
Retire GT Units I & 2
1997         10 MW Test Wind Farm
1998         60 MW MSD
Retain 40 MW Emergency Capacity

2000         60 MW MSD
2002         240 MW Coal-Fired Steam
Retire Old Harbour Units 1, 2, & 3
2005         Retire Hunts Bay Unit 6
In addition to the system optimization runs, JPS was asked to run several sensitivity cases in
order to give an indication of the relative merits of substituting other candidate plants for the Old
Harbour Unit 4 and Gas Turbine Units 3, 4, &5 projects. The results are compared below in terms of
net present value of system annual operating costs, including capital investment in new generating
plants.
NPV 1995$
Least Cost Plan                              2,082 million
Retire OH Unit 4, no replacement             2,087
Retire GT Units 3,4,5 in 1998, no replacement  2,086
Retire OH Unit 4, Add 63 MW Oil/steam in 1999    2,091
Retire OH Unit 4, Add 60 MW MSD in 1998      2,097
Retire OH Unit 4, Add 60 MW LSD in 1998      2,101
As a further demonstration of the justification of the least cost plan, a system expansion
optimization was run for the case in which OH Unit 4 is not rehabilitated and the WASP program is
allowed to chose the most economic expansion sequence. The unit retirement schedule was not
otherwise changed for this run. The resulting schedule of additions is identical to the base case above,
with a new 63MW oil-fired steam unit in 1999 to replace Old Harbour number 4. given below. The net
present value for this case is $2,091 million.
Several other qualitative considerations for the two projects have been advanced by JPS.
These include the short lead time involved in returning base load generating capacity to the system and
the relatively low cost of extending the life of this capacity for at least another fifteen years as well as
the postponement of the need for developing a new plant site. There is also the consideration that
according to JPS the insurance claim and subsequent recovery of funds could be restricted to the book
value of the OH Unit 4 boiler if the unit is not replaced with equipment of a similar size and design.
Based on this least cost analysis it is concluded that the two generation projects should be
included in the short term expansion sequence of JPS.
BEN1EFIT COST ANALYSIS
As mentioned above, each project was also analysed for economic feasibility on an individual
basis by examining the differences in costs and benefits to JPS between the least cost plan with the
project included and the same plan without the project included. The investment, O&M, fuel and
unserved energy costs were determined in each case and the annual net benefits calculated to arrive at
benefit/cost ratios and economic intemal rates of return.



- 93 -
The annual operating, investment and unserved energy costs were determined from successive
runs of the generation simulation model with the project in question included and without the project.
In the without case there were no changes made to the expansion plan, thus the project energy and
capacity removed from the plan is made up from other units and an increase in unserved energy.
The "costs" of the project are the related direct investment costs of the generation and other
facilities included in the project cost estimate, excluding all price contingencies and interest during
construction. The "benefits" include the differences in other investment costs, O&M, fuel and unserved
energy costs. For each project a base case is developed based on the economic assumptions in Table 2.
Additional cases are run in order to examine the sensitivity of the results to changes in key
assumptions and variables. The sensivity parameters chosen include: capital cost, 0 & M costs,
discount rate, unit cost of unserved energy and fuel costs. For the OH Unit 4 analysis a case was also
run in which it is assumed that the insurance payout is only at book value for the boiler and other
damaged equipment. The effect is to penalize the 'without' case by the difference in the estimated cost
of the unit repairs ($21 million) and JPS's book value of the damaged assets (approximately $5 million).
The results of the base case runs and sensitivity analyses are summarized below. The details of
the base case analysis for each of the generation projects are given in Tables 3 and 4.
ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The proposed investment in an updated EMS was also analysed in terms of the benefits
expected to be provided through increased efficiency in daily load dispatch (which translate into fuel
savings) and improvements in system reliability (reductions in unserved energy). Recent estimates of
these savings suggest a 2% reduction in the utilitys annual costs bill and a 100/o improvement in
unserved energy costs.
Table 5 illustrates the annual flows of costs and benefits for this project. The resulting
benefit/cost ratio of 1.88 and an EIRR of 20.4% indicate economic feasibility for the proposed
investment.

JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY
NOTES ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Regulation:
The company operates under an exclusive thirty-nine year All-island Electric License granted on
August 31, 1978. Under the provisions of the License the operations of the company are subject
to regulation by the Minister of Public Utilities with power and authority to require observance
and performance by the company of its obligations under the License, and to regulate the rates
charged by the company.
Ownership:
The govemment is the owner of approximately 99% of the issued ordinary share capital of the
company, through the Electricity Authority and the Accountant General.
Summary of Accounting Policies:
The records of the company are maintained in accordance with the regulations prescribed for
Public Utilities by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of the United States, in so far as
these regulations allow compliance with the Companies Act, the License and directives from the
Minister.
(a)   Utility plant and depreciation: In accordance with the License, utility plant and
replacement of retirement units of property are capitalized and include direct labor,
materials, indirect charges for administration, transportation and similar items,
reduced by non-refundable contributions in-aid of construction. The company
capitalizes an allowance for funds used during construction based on its average
cost of funds. Replacement of minor items of property are included in
maintenance expenses. The replacement cost of depreciable units of plant retired
is eliminated from utility plant accounts and such value plus removal expenses, less
salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation.
In accordance with the License, depreciation of utility plant is computed using a straight
line basis on the replacement cost of such asset in service at the beginning of each month. The
rates used are in accordance with the License, the composite rate being approximately 4% per
annum.
(b)   Materials and supplies: These include construction materials and fuel stocks and
stated at average cost.



- 112-
Annex 6-14
Page 2 of 2
(c)   Revenue Accounts receivable and unbilled revenue: Revenue consists of cycle
billings rendered to customers monthly or bi-monthly with an accrual for revenue
earned but billed subsequent to the end of the period. Accounts receivable
represent the amount due from customers for billed services less a provision for
doubtful accounts. Unbilled revenue represents the accrual for electricity supplied
prior to the year end which is billed subsequently.
(d)   Deferred expenditures: (i) Debt discount and expenses include issue expenses,
commitment fees and similar items which are being amortized over the lives of the
loans to which they relate; and (ii) Other consist of costs which are expected to
benefit future periods; these are deferred and are either amortized over their
expected periods of benefit, transferred to plant and equipment or charged against
income as appropriate.
(e)   Foreign exchange translation: Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet
date. Any losses or gains not forming part of the revaluation are reflected in
income.
(f)    Taxation: Taxation is only recorded if taxable income results from computations
made in accordance with Taxation note (a) below. No charges or credits for
deferred taxation are recorded.
(g)   Pension costs: Pension costs are charged to expense to the extent of actual
company contributions payable based on percentage of employee pensionable
earnings.
Taxation:
(a)   The principal differences in computing the profit for accounting purposes and the
taxable profit are: (i) investment allowances equivalent to 20% of the cost of the
additions to plant are granted for tax purposes; (ii) tax depreciation is significantly
less than depreciation charged against profit; (iii) the allowance for funds used
during construction is not included in the profit for tax purposes nor is the
allowance included in the written down value of fixed assets for tax purposes; (iv)
preference dividends are deductible for tax purposes; and (v) interest is claimable
for tax purposes when paid instead of when charged.
(b)   Taxation is based on the profit for the year adjusted for taxation purposes.
(c)   During FY93, an appraisal of the company's plant in service was conducted by
Stone and Webster Management Consultants Incorporated and local independent
valuators. Land and buildings were restated to current market value and
depreciated current replacement cost is used.

Attention: Mr. Zia Mian
Indebtedness of Govt. Agencies to J.P.S.Co.
Dear Sir,
This is to confirm that in accordance with Cabinet
Decision No. 20/95 and consistent with the restructuring of the
National Water Commission (N.W.C.), the Ministry of Finance and
Planning has assumed the responsibility for the current
liabilities of the N.W.C. including the outstanding loans to
the J.P.S.Co. to the tune of approximately six hundred and
eighty eight million Jamaican dollars. In addition, the N.W.C.
is presently paying daily amounts of J$ 2 million and will
continue to keep their bills paid up-to-date.
With respect to the other Government Departments and
Ministries, the Ministry of Finance and Planning ensures that
from now on sufficient funds will be made available in their
monthly warrants to defray their indebtedness to J.P.S.Co.
