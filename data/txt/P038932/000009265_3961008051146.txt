MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SINGLE CURRENCY LOAN TO JAMAICA
FOR A GENERATION RECOVERY AND IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Jamaica for the amount of US$ 21 million. The loan would be a fixed rate US dollar single
currency for up to 15 years. Each semester's aggregate (Disbursed Amount) will have a grace period
of 3 years and a final maturity of 12 years; both beginning from the rate fixing date for such
Disbursed Amount. The Government of Jamaica is eligible for single currency loan terms, since it has
authorized conversion of all VLR82 loans. Including the proposed loan, single currency loans to
Jamnaica would amount to US$21 million under the expanded single currency loan program, or 28% of
the Bank's planned FY96 lending to Jamaica of US$ 75 million equivalent. The proceeds of the loan
would be on lent to Janaica Public Service Company (JPS) under termns and conditions which shall
have been approved by the Bank, including, inter alia, the following: overall repayment term of up to
15 years (final maturity of 12 years, including a grace period of 3 years, for each semester's disbursed
amount); the same interest rate applicable to the Loan; and same commitment charges applicable to the
Loan. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and JPS are financing other components of the
project in an amount of US$ 55.5 million equivalent.
Background
2.    Jamaica, one of the largest islands in the Caribbean, has a total area of 11,000 km2 and a
population estimated at 2.5 million. About 45% of the land is used for agriculture; 55% of the
population lives in urban areas. Per capita income in 1994 was estimated at US$ 1,420. The country is
well endowed with natural resources, has a relatively well educated and skilled labor force, enjoys
proximity to North American markets, and has a developed financial system. The economy, however,
is vulnerable to external factors such as foreign demand for bauxite/alumina and tourism, its key
exports, and the price of oil.
3.    The World Bank, IMF and IDB are supporting the country in implementing a macroeconomic
reform program which is based on liberalizing the economy and increasing the role of the private
sector. Since 1989, Government has pursued a bold program of reforms, including privatization, tax
reform, liberalization of trade and exchange rate regimes and elimination of the fiscal deficit. Jamaica
has the potential for extending recovery and sustaining economic growth in the 1990s. A recently-
completed Country Economic Memorandum' (CEM) endorses the Government's Medium Term
Reform Program whereby economic reforms will continue to focus on reducing the role of the public
sector in commercially-oriented and industrial activities while creating a competitive environment to
stimulate private investment and export.
4.    Government has been largely successful in applying these policies, as evidenced by: (a) overall
budget surpluses in recent years; (b) a reduction of inflation from 77 percent in 1992 to about 25% in
1Jamaica- A strategy for growth and poverty reduction. Country Economic Memorandum. Report No. 12702-JM,
April 12, 1994.



- 2 -
1993-94; (c) free trading of the currency and an increase in foreign exchange deposits from zero to
over US$ 500 million; (d) a rapid growth of the Jamaican Stock Exchange; and (e) the successful
privatization of over 50 entities with Bank support through the Private Sector Development
Adjustment Loan (PSDAL).
5.    The Energy Sector. Jamaica's sources of indigenous energy are limited, comprised of a small
hydropower potential, bagasse and peat. The country relies on imports, mostly oil, to meet most of its
energy needs. which renders the economy vulnerable to intemational oil price increases or disruptions
in supply. The Jamaican economy is highly energy intensive due to the bauxite/alumina industry, and
hence Jamaica's level of energy consumption per capita is high in comparison with countries at a similar
income level.
6.    The Government has a well-defined energy policy. The objectives of the energy policy are
to: (a) ensure stable and adequate energy supplies at the least economic cost through a
combination of public and private sector participation in a deregulated and liberalized
environment; (b) diversify the energy base, encourage the development of indigenous energy
resources where economically viable and technically feasible, and ensure the security of energy
supplies; (c) encourage efficiency in energy production, conversion and use with the overall
objectives of reducing the energy intensity of the economy; (d) complement the country's
industrial policy by recognizing the importance of energy as a critical input to industrial growth
and stability; (e) minimize the adverse environmental effects and pollution caused by the
production, storage, transport and use of energy; and (f) establish an appropriate regulatory
framework to protect consumers, investors, the environment and sector entities.
7.    The Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport (MPUT) is responsible for overseeing the
energy sector and coordinating policies with the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ). GOJ has
already carried out a series of actions to put in place its new sector policy. An Energy Sector
Deregulation and Privatization Steering Committee (PSC) was formed in November 1990 to
coordinate the activities and provide policy guidance required for private sector participation in
energy development. The Bank has supported through the Energy Sector Deregulation and
Privatization Project (ESDPP) the establishment of an Energy Sector Policy Implementation Unit
to assist MPUT in the implementation of energy related projects financed by multilateral agencies
and the implementation of current privatization programs. Following the findings and
recommendations proposed in completed reports by consultants, the Office of Utility Regulation
Act, 1995 (OUR) has been approved by the parliament. The OUR will protect the interest of both
the consumer and the investor in the provision and utilization of public utility services, as
determined by GOJ policy guidelines.
8.    The operative institutions in the sector are the JPS and the Petroleum Corporation of
Jamaica (PCJ). PCJ is a wholly owned state corporation with a number of subsidiaries whose
activities include importing crude oil and petroleum products, refining, exporting some products,
distributing petroleum products and the exploration, development and management of petroleum
resources. Petroleum subsector policy consists of (a) liberalizing the industry with limited protection of
the refinery; (b) divestment of the refinery; (c) establishing mechanisms to monitor prices and protect
consumers; (d) divestment of PCJ subsidiaries which are financially viable; and (e) restructuring of PCJ.

9.    The Power Sector. JPS, the only power utility in Jamaica, has had the sole responsibility for
the generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power for public consumption. The GOJ has
99% ownership of the company which reports to MPUT. In addition to JPS, there are a number of
private independent generators of electricity who produce power for their own consumption, such as
the bauxite companies. JPS has recently entered into a number of arrangements with independent
power producers to purchase electricity. It has installed power generation capacity of 568 MW, of
which 323 MW comes from oil-fired steam units, 36 MW from diesel units, 186 MW from gas turbines
(GTs) and 23 MW from hydropower. Of this only 359 MW is base load capacity and the rest
represent peaking capacity. On the operational side, JPS' system losses are high. A specific action
program to reduce these losses, particularly non-technical losses, is a part of the Corporate Action
Plan.
10.   GOJ has taken the decision to deregulate and liberalized the electricity sector, thereby
allowing Independent Power Producers (IPP) to be the main players within the sector, with the
government becoming a minority partner. In this regard, all new generating capacity is to be
provided by private developers. GOJ has also announced its intention to privatize JPS and invited
applications from international companies for prequalification to bid. These are major policy
initiatives which are aimed at moving the entire system of generation, transmission and
distribution into private sector ownership and management. Major policy initiatives, therefore, in
the power sector are to ensure that an appropriate regulatory framework is put in place to: (a)
facilitate the timely provision of new power generating capacity and the associated transmission
works; (b) establish an environment capable of attracting private investments in the power sector
and capable of supporting long term financing for the private sector; and (c) generally support
Jamaica's power sector privatization program.
11.   The main power sector entity, JPS in the recent past has been unable to meet two key financial
covenants under the existing Bank loan: namely, an acceptable level of receivables from the public
sector entities and an 8% rate of return on its fixed assets. GOJ has taken measures to deal with both
these issues. Concerning the receivables from the public sector, the government has implemented
measures which have brought down the overall public sector overdue payments from 151 days in June,
1995, to 31 days in July, 1995; comprising one day for National Water Commission (NWC) and 61
days for the rest of the government. With regard to the 8% rate of return covenant, having announced
its intention to privatize JPS, GOJ is in the process of revaluing JPS' assets based on their realistic
market value. Based on a 13.4% requested increase in tariffs at the beginning of the fiscal year, JPS
has projected that for the JPS fiscal year 1995/96 it will obtain a 6% return on current valuation of
assets. If, as is most likely, this increase is only made effective in October 1995 (i.e. middle of the fiscal
year), the projected return will drop to 4.2%. As a consequence of the explosion and streamlining of
its organizational structure prior to privatization, JPS is expected to incur one time additional expenses
of about J$832 million in FY95/96. If these expenses were excluded and the requested tariff increase
is only effective in October 1995, the rate of return would be about 8.8%. During the mid-term review
of the ESDPP, JPS' financial performance will be critically reviewed.
12.   Recent Disruptions. On June 3, 1994, an explosion at Old Harbour Power Station (OHIPS)
wiped out 123 MW of JPS' base load capacity (22% of installed capacity or 34% of base load
capacity), thus reducing its reserve margin which is critical for the reliable operation of the system. All
remaining plants, specifically the peaking units, are being operated for extended periods of time,



- 4 -
increasing the forced outages. Consequently, JPS has been scheduling island-wide power cuts. These
power cuts are adversely affecting the economic recovery effort of the country. The success of the
Government's overall economic development strategy depends on having an adequate, reliable,
and clean power supply as a requisite for growth of modern enterprises, particularly of export
services. If the current economic trends are to be sustained the restoration of the lost generation
capacity at Old Harbour, on an urgent basis, is considered critical. Provision of reliable power
will not only improve the investment climate but will also reduce the need for individual
enterprises to have back-up generators and increase opportunity of small and micro enterprises to
grow with modern technology. To deal with the emergency situation, JPS obtained a three year
supply contract with a company who is providing 40MW from gas turbine peaking units. The GOJ
has requested the Bank to provide financing to restore the lost capacity and to improve the generation
reliability, monitoring and control systems.
Project Objectives
13.   The objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) restore normal electricity service by replacing
lost generating capacity; (b) reduce generation costs by upgrading existing facilities; (c) enhance system
reliability by improving the energy control system and by reinforcing the transmission network to
reduce the likelihood of future recurrence of generating plant incidents; (d) improve resource allocation
through electricity tariff reforms (through completion of LRMC to support GOJ and OUR to structure
long-term basis for tariffs); and (e) reduce and control environmental damage in power system
facilities.
Project Description
14.   To achieve its objectives, the project will consist of the following components (Schedule A):
(a) Repair and rehabilitation of the 55MW Old Harbour Unit 3 which was partially damaged in the
explosion (US$ 10 million); (b) Restoration of the 68.5MW Old Harbour Unit No. 4 boiler which
suffered major destruction (US$ 21 million); (c) Life extension of Old Harbour Unit No. 4 generation
turbine in order for the non-damaged sections to match the replaced equipment (US$ 8.6 million); (d)
Upgrade of three gas turbines in order to extend their lifetime for ten years (US$ 6.7 million); (e)
Upgrade of the telecommunications and control system (US$ 8.5 million); (f) Construction of new
transmission lines and associated substation equipment (US$ 12.4 million); (g) Environmental
mitigation measures (US$ 2.0 million); and (h) Consulting services (US$ 1.5 million).
15.   Total project costs amount to US$ 69.5 million; physical and price contingencies amount to
US$ 2.7 million and Interest During Construction (IDC) amounts to US$ 4.3 million for a total cost of
US$ 76.5 million. The project will be financed by the Bank (US$ 21 million), by IDB (US$ 23.3
rnillion) and by JPS (US$ 32.2 million - Schedule B).
16.   JPS has presented an insurance claim of US$ 40 million for property and consequential
damages. The insurers have so far agreed to pay US$ 35 million but have not yet agreed on the limits
of their future liability for damages. Because of the multitude of insurers involved as well as differences
regarding the causes of the explosion, the final settlement of claims (including consequential damages)
is expected to be delayed (in the interim emergency expenses are being financed by JPS). As it is an
all-risk policy, insurers will pay for the reinstatement of facilities destroyed or damaged in the incident,



- 5 -
but not for their betterment. If JPS abstains from restoring Old Harbour Unit 4, the insurers are only
expected to pay for the book value of the asset, estimated at US$ 5 million, whereas they would pay
US$ 22.3 million if the unit is restored. Regarding responsibility for the accident, an independent firm
(Forensic Technology International) determnined that JPS had adopted a reasonable approach to
maintaining safe operational conditions. The Bank has retained a consultant to examine the insurance
issue who concluded that JPS should proceed with the reinstatement of equipment immediately and
GOJ is following his advice. The Bank will finance those components which are not covered by the
insurance policy (life extension, upgrading of generation facilities, project implementation and the
implementation of environmental mitigation measures).
Project Implementation
17.   The project will be implemented by JPS under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the
Borrower. The project is expected to be implemented in a relatively short time. To ensure that the
implementation of the recovery works proceeds on schedule, JPS has appointed Project Management
Consultants to assist in steering the implementation of the various project components. JPS will
monitor overall project implementation through a special Project Executing Unit (PEU). Considering
the urgency of the reinstatement and life extension on Unit 4 turbine, procurement of parts and
services will be from the original manufacturer on a direct construction contract. Procurement and
installation costs will be financed by the proposed loan retroactively up to US$ 6.3 million or 30%
of the loan amount. Goods and services for other Bank financed components will be procured
using Bank guidelines through ICB, national competitive bidding, (for contracts of up to
US$500,000) and local/foreign shopping for small items (up to US$100,000). Bank will disburse
100% of the costs of project components relating to: life extension of Old Harbour unit No. 4;
Telecommunications and Energy Management System; implementation of environmental
mitigation measures; and consulting services. All records relative to project expenditures will be
kept by the PEU within JPS and audited by JPS' external auditors.
Project Sustainability
18.   Project costs would be recovered through electricity sales. Government policy regarding
electricity prices consists of the following rate-setting principles: (a) rates should reflect frll costs
including duties and taxes; (b) overall revenue requirements to be established on the basis of
existing loan agreements with international agencies and GOJ to meet rate of return and/or self-
financing tests with adjustments for inflation based on a retail price index minus an incentive
factor for productivity improvement; (c) automatic pass through of foreign exchange and fuel cost
fluctuations; (d) tariffs to be structured according to long run marginal cost principles reflecting
peak and off-peak costs, voltage levels, capacity and energy costs; and (e) pass through of
purchased power charges and adjustments, subject to regulatory approval. The cost of long term
power purchase agreements would also be reflected in the tariffs. A preliminary marginal cost
LRMC tariff study in 1992 showed that at that time tariffs exceeded the long run marginal costs by
about 15%. Tariffs have since fallen from US Cent 13.5 to US Cent 12.5 per kWh due in part to a lack
of adjustment for local inflationr As a part of the proposed project JPS will commission a
comprehensive LRMC which will be used as a basis for restructuring the tariffs.

Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement
19.   The Bank has made five loans totaling US$150.5 million for power sector development to
Jamaica.2 These lending operations have involved financing construction of generation,
transmission, and distribution facilities, and providing technical assistance for improving
operations and maintenance practices and overall efficiency of the JPS's operations. The PCR for
the Third Power Project summarized the major lessons learned from that project as: (a) financial
viability can be maintained if early action is taken to increase tariffs to compensate for increasing
costs caused by currency depreciation; (b) loss of qualified staff, through inadequate
compensation can dilute the effectiveness of training programs; and (c) where there are
insufficient local staff to carry out timely procurement and construction steps, consultants should
be engaged to avoid delayed project benefits. Most of the lessons have already been addressed
through the Fourth Power Project and ESDPP. JPS tariffs now include an automaticity to adjust
for fluctuations in the price of fuel and depreciation of local currency. Under the Fourth Power
Project the establishment and subsequent strengthening of the Project Execution Unit has improved
JPS's capacity for project implementation. This was demonstrated during the implementation of
ESDPP, under which JPS was able to complete the construction and civil works ahead of schedule. In
regard to the delays in procurement and other construction-related activities, provision is being made
under the proposed Project for the use of consultants to prepare feasibility studies, bidding documents
and assist in procurement to avoid delays in project implementation..
Rationale for Bank Involvement
20.   JPS is involved in a major restructuring of its corporate organization in order to incorporate
efficiency incentives through market measures. One of the ultimate goals in the reorganization process
is the privatization of JPS. While the privatization program and regulatory framework is under
implementation, it is essential that JPS' generation transmission and distribution facilities are
maintained: to ensure reliable and adequate power supply to the country. Given the Bank's recent
experience in structuring private sector projects and its indepth knowledge of the country, the Bank's
support for the proposed project will ensure that the system can return to normal service conditions,
thereby allowing the power sector reorganization and privatization to proceed smoothly.
21.    Although not specifically identified at that time, the proposed project is fully consistent with the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board in March 1993. Future Bank
lending would consist largely of investment loan financing, tax administration reform, public sector
modernization, transport, and other infrastructure development, social investments and private sector
development.
2 These loans include: (i) Power I (No. 454-JM) for US$22 million, approved in 1966 and completed in 1972;
(ii) Power Il (No. 1516-JM) for US$20 million, approved in 1978 and completed in 1984; (iii) Power III (No.
2188-JM) for US$30.5 million, approved in 1982 and completed in 1987; (iv) Power IV (No. 2869-JM) for
US$18 million, approved in 1987 and completed in June 1995; and (v) Energy Sector Deregulation and
Privatization Project (Ln. 3502-JM) for US$60 million, approved in 1992 to finance JPS (US$20 million) and
to support a power plant in the private sector (US$40 million).

Agreed Actions
22.   Agreements have been reached with the Borrower that: (a) JPS will commission a
comprehensive Long Run Marginal Cost Study which will be used as a basis for restructuring the
tariffs; (b) JPS will implement mitigatory measures to bring the ambient SO2 environmental
emission levels in compliance with the current World Bank standards by 1999 and the NRCA's
interim standards by 2000. JPS will submit a study and an acceptable mitigation plan to the Bank,
duly endorsed by NRCA, before effectiveness; and (c) the Borrower will enter into a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement with JPS before the Loan becomes effective. Adequate steps have been taken
by the Ministry of Finance and Planning to reduce the accounts receivable of JPS from NWC,
government ministries and departments. Agreements have also been reached on a Corporate
Action Plan to restore a rate of return on JPS' average net revalued fixed assets of at least 8%.
Environmental Aspects
23.   A recent Environmental Assessment (EA) of the Old Harbour Power Station recommended the
implementation of: sulfur dioxide mitigating measures; a wastewater treatment plant, oil spillage
containment, remediation of contaminated soils, on-line condenser cooling and laboratory upgrading.
JPS will prepare a study before loan effectiveness and develop an acceptable mitigation plan, to deal
with the ambient sulfur dioxide levels. The environmental component of the project will finance the
required investments. An environmental rating of"B" has been assigned, considering the
environmental improvements that will be achieved with this project.
Program Objective Categories
24.   The project is expected to support the country's private sector development strategy by
supporting infrastructure investments that will allow the govemment to ultimately privatize the existing
power sector and encourage the participation of private sector in future expansion.
Project Benefits
25.   Expected project benefits consist of: (a) a reduction in fuel costs; and (b) a reduction in power
cuts and unserved energy due to increased reliability. The restoration of Old Harbour unit number 4
has an intemal rate of return of 30%, and the Energy Management System has an expected IRR of
20%.
Project Risks
26.   The identified risks to the project include: continued government commitment to privatization
of the energy sector; JPS ability to bring down system losses and relapse in NWC receivables; and
failure to collect on the insurance payments. Under the Private Sector Development Adjustment Loan
and ESDPP projects, GOJ is proceeding with the agreed privatization program. Progress on this
program will be confirmed during the mid-term review of ESDPP. With respect to the level of system
losses, JPS has established an acceptable action plan which will be reviewed and updated during the
supervision of the proposed project. The risk of relapse in the NWC receivables is low because it has
now been financially restructured and will be able to meet its commitments. Concerning the failure to



- 8 -
collect on insurance claims, JPS has retained the legal and technical services to assist in the resolution
of this matter.
27.   Three additional risks could be: cost, technology, organization and management. Over 70
percent of the project cost estimates have been established in the course of negotiations with suppliers
and contractors and, therefore, the risk of cost overruns is low. The technologies proposed are
generally the most current technologies in use for generation and communication equipment. The
environmental measures proposed are all addressable using established technology. Timing the life
extension work on the Old Harbour No. 4 turbine with the restoration of the destroyed facilities will
require close management supervision and tracking. The organization and management risks to the
project components are considered to be low due to JPS' experience with project implementation and
the use of experienced consultants and advisors. The risk of delays due to governmental bureaucratic
procedures will be addressed through the involvement of the Energy Sector Policy Implementation
Unit to assist in clearing government red tape.
Financial Benefits and Risks
28.   The Borrower has reviewed Bank's alternative loan terms--Currency Pool Loan, LEBOR -
Based single Currency Loan and Fixed Rate Single Currency Loan terms -- and has selected a fixed
rate single currency loan in U.S. dollar in order to improve the overall liability management and
reduce currency risk. In order to be able to provide long-term stability in the level of electric
tariffs, the Borrower has opted for the fixed interest rate.
Recommendation
