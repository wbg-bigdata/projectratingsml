                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower to reduce poverty and to support mechanisms for the promotion of a peaceful and safe environment in the conflict-
                         affected areas in the ARMM Region and in particular to: (a) improve access to social and economic infrastructure and livelihood opportunities; (b) strengthen social
                         cohesion and partnerships between and within targeted communities; and (c) improve local governance and institutional capacities for implementation in the ARMM
                         Region, with a focus on improved participation, transparency and accountability in the allocation and management of public resources by the participating communities,
                         local government units and ARMM RG.
