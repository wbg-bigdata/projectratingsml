                         Government Units and social preparation has begun in 102 villages out of the target of 597. The quality of social preparation was found to be generally in order by a November 2011
                         assessment. Despite intensive efforts, however, the project is around three months behind schedule due to a series of factors including: slow finalization of the conditions for loan
                         effectiveness; delayed implementation in Maguindanao province due to the requirement in the Loan Agreement to assess the governance and peace and order situation before
                         commencing activities; security concerns in Basilan province; and more stringent requirements for registration of People's Organizations. A catch-up plan is being prepared, but an

                         extension could be necessary. On the final element of the Project Development Objective - improve local governance and institutional capacities for implementation - the program is
                         providing a strong demonstration effect on how to transparently manage development resources, but spillover effects remain limited at this stage. A performance-based Municipal
                         Block Grant sub-component that is intended to provide an incentive for better local governance in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao was launched in December 2011.
                         Incentive effects on the macro-governance environment will be monitored as this new sub-component is rolled out.
