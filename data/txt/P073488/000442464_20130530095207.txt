The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower to reduce poverty and to support mechanisms for the
promotion of a peaceful and safe environment in the conflict-affected areas in the ARMM Region and in
particular to: (a) improve access to social and economic infrastructure and livelihood opportunities; (b)
strengthen social cohesion and partnerships between and within targeted communities; and (c) improve
local governance and institutional capacities for implementation in the ARMM Region, with a focus on
improved participation, transparency and accountability in the allocation and management of public
resources by the participating communities, local government units and ARMM Regional Government.

      Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Social Fund Project (P073488)

                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Social Fund Project (also known as the
ARMM Social Fund) will be restructured as follows: (i) changes in selected indicators in
the Results Framework to accommodate core sector indicators, more closely link the
Results Framework to the Project Development Objective (PDO) and to drop indicators
for which there is no available credible data. In addition, the Annex to Schedule 2 of the
Loan Agreement (7912-PH), which contains “Monitorable Indicators?, will be deleted.
The project indicators are already included as an Annex to the Operations Manual, so
deleting them from the Loan Agreement will facilitate greater flexibility for the Borrower
and the Bank to update the indicators as necessary; and (ii) extend the closing date by
twelve months from May 31, 2013 to May 31, 2014.

The extension of closing date is due to security challenges in what is a highly conflict-
affected area, as well as delays due to late effectiveness that were beyond the control of
the implementing agency.

B. PROJECT STATUS

The ARMM Social Fund Project is a community-driven development project operating in
the conflict-affected Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in the southern
Philippines. The Original Loan for $33.6 million (7153-PH) was approved on December
5, 2002 and the Loan Agreement signed on January 20, 2003. It was due to close on May
31, 2008, but was later extended to May 2010 and again until its closing date of August
31, 2010. At closure the loan amount was fully disbursed. The Loan Agreement for $30
million in Additional Financing (Loan 7912-PH) was signed on August 31, 2010 and
became effective on November 5, 2010.

Project implementation progress under the Additional Financing (AF) has been sound in
a challenging context, with the reasons for the proposed extension mostly beyond the
control of the Project Management Office. As of May 14, 2013, total disbursements for
the AF loan amounted to US$22.78 million or 72 per cent of the total Additional
Financing loan amount of US$30 million. The Loan continues to achieve its intended
purpose and the overall PDO remains achievable. Progress towards achievement of the
PDO and Overall Implementation Progress have both been rated Moderately Satisfactory
in the last two Implementation Status and Results Reports (dating back to July 2012).
Overall Safeguards Compliance has also been rated as Moderately Satisfactory over the
same period. The project Overall Risk Rating is Substantial.

      D.       JUSTIFICATIONS

      1.     The overall thrust of the revisions is to: (i) accommodate relevant Core Sector
      Indicators; (ii) add an indicator on increased consumption to strengthen the link to the
      PDO objective of reducing poverty; (iii) simplify the Results Framework by eliminating
      duplication and reducing the number of indicators for which no credible data is available

                                                       8
or which are not completely relevant to the PDO or an Intermediate Outcome; and (iv)
update targets for the final year of the project in light of the proposed one-year extension
of the closing date.

2.      To facilitate more flexibility in revising indicators as necessary, it is also
proposed to delete the indicators from the Loan Agreement, retaining them as an Annex
to the Operations Manual. This was discussed and agreed by the Bank and the Borrower
during the April 2013 Implementation Support Mission and is captured accordingly in the
mission Aide Memoire.

3.      The proposed extension, on the other hand, is necessary to complete the agreed
targets for the AF phase and is justified on the following grounds:

             The AF work plan was drafted with a three-year time frame in mind.
       However, the AF did not become effective until November 2010, leaving just
       over two and a half years for a three-year program.

             A legal covenant for the AF required the Borrower to complete an
       assessment of governance and security in Maguindanao province following the
       massacre of 57 people there in November 2009, allegedly at the hands of
       members of the Ampatuan family, who at the time held the positions of ARMM
       Regional Governor and Maguindanao Governor, among others. While the
       assessment was ongoing, activities were suspended in Maguindanao for six
       months, delaying progress in the largest of the five provinces in ARMM.

              Lengthy political transition - elections were due in ARMM in August
       2011. Due to concerns over weak governance, the National Government sought
       to suspend the elections and appoint a new Regional Governor and Regional
       Legislative Assembly through Republic Act 10153. While passed by Congress,
       execution of the law was stalled due to a Supreme Court injunction. Following
       extensive delays, the injunction was lifted and the ARMM Interim Government
       installed in December 2011. This period saw a vacuum in leadership and
       ultimately, handover to a new Project Manager for the ARMM Social Fund.

              Peace and security issues have affected implementation, including a major
       outbreak of violence in Basilan province in October 2011 when 19 soldiers were
       killed in fierce ground and aerial battles between the Armed Forces of the
       Philippines and armed groups. This caused the suspension of project activities in
       the area for more than a month. Regular clan fighting, particularly in Lanao del
       Sur, has caused delays in implementation in different program villages.

              In 2009, the Commission on Audit required peoples’ organizations
       established under the project at the village level to register with either the
       Cooperatives Development Authority or the Securities and Exchange Commission
       to receive project funds. This process is more arduous than the previous
       requirement to register with the ARMM Department of Social Welfare and
       Development. It caused significant delays.

4.      The Borrower has prepared a work and financial plan for the proposed extension
period. The plan has been reviewed and is endorsed by the Bank. It anticipates nearly all
implementation in the field will be completed by the end of 2013, leaving the January-
May 2014 period to focus on completion activities and wrap up.

5.      The Recipient has no outstanding audit reports and Interim Financial Reports to
date as per Bank’s records.

6.     This will be the first extension of the project during the AF phase. The project
was extended twice under the Original Loan.

Project Development Objective (PDO): The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower to reduce poverty and to support mechanisms for the promotion of a peaceful and safe environment in the
conflict-affected areas in the ARMM Region and in particular to: (a) improve access to social and economic infrastructure and livelihood opportunities; (b) strengthen social cohesion and partnerships
between and within targeted communities; and (c) improve local governance and institutional capacities for implementation in the ARMM Region, with a focus on improved participation, transparency
and accountability in the allocation and management of public resources by the participating communities, local government units and ARMM Regional Government.
