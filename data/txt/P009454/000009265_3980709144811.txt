IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
PRIVATE SECTOR INDUSTRIAL CREDIT
(Credit 2340-BD)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Private Sector Industrial
Credit (PSIC) to Bangladesh ( Credit 2340-BD) in the amount of SDRI 8.3 million (US$25.5
million) equivalent, which was approved by the IDA Board on February 27, 1992 and made
effective on March 22, 1993.
The PSIC was closed on September 30, 1997, which was the original Closing Date.
Disbursements were low during the initial years of the project, reaching only 33 percent of
the appraisal estimates by FY96. However, these increased substantially after the credit was
amended to incorporate leasing companies, resulting in over 95 percent of credit utilization
by January 31, 1998, which was the final date for disbursements under the PSIC.
This ICR was prepared by Mr. Alfredo Dammert, Finance and Private Sector
Development Unit, South Asia Region, and reviewed by Mr. Joseph Pernia, Acting Sector
Manager.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during an IDA mission that took place in
November 1997. Also, it is based on materials in the project files and information provided
by the Borrower and the financial intermediaries that benefited under the PSIC line of credit.
The Borrower contributed to the preparation of this ICR by providing its own evaluation of
the Project, which has been reproduced (unedited) in the Appendix.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
PRIVATE SECTOR INDUSTRIAL CREDIT (PSIC)
(IDA Credit 2340-BD)
Evaluation Summary'
1.    From the early 1970s to the mid-1980s, IDA approved five financial intermediation
(FI) operations aimed at financing small, medium and large scale industry (SAR, para. 1.10).
No further financial sector operations were approved until 1990, when the Government
announced a comprehensive reform program for the financial sector. To support such
program, in 1990 IDA approved the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC, Cr. 2152-
BD) for US$175 million, followed in 1992 by the PSIC for US$25.5 million.
2.    Project Objectives - The objective of the Private Sector Industrial Credit (PSIC) was
to support the financial sector reforms initiated by the Government of Bangladesh (GOB),
while promoting private sector development through financing private investments in
productive activities. Specifically, the project aimed at: (a) promoting more rational decision
making by lenders and subborrowers; (b) expanding term lending facilities in Taka and US
dollars by providing a line of credit to eligible financial intermediaries (FIs); (c) supporting
private sector development through subloans for industrial investments under a line of credit;
and (d) developing and applying environmental guidelines and standards for industry (part I,
para. 1).
3.    The project objectives and its design were in line with the GOB's priority reform
programs and the IDA's assistance strategy for Bangladesh. In December 1987, IDA
completed a major sector study, " Bangladesh: A Program for Financial Sector Reform",
which identified substantial weaknesses in the financial system (part I, para. 2), some of
which have been addressed under the FSAC. The GOB and IDA believed that supporting the
development of term lending for industry under the PSIC was important for strengthening the
banking system and promoting industrial sector growth (part I, para. 3).
4.    Implementation Experience and Results of the Project - The project components
included: (a) a US$25 million equivalent line of credit to eligible FIs; and (b) a technical
assistance component for US$0.5 million to the Department of Environment (DOE) for the
development and application of environmental guidelines and standards for industry. In
addition, agreements were reached with the GOB to: (a) widen the domestic currency term
lending rate band for medium and large scale industry; (b) develop a program to expedite
loan recoveries; (c) allow the use of differential rates to different clients and maturities to
reflect relative risk; and (d) decontrol interest rates on foreign exchange loans issued in
Bangladesh (part I, para. 4).

implementation experience.



iv
5.    The project objectives established under the PSIC were substantially achieved
despite major problems at the beginning of the project, which slowed down progress during
the initial stages of implementation. Under the PSIC: (a) the objective of more rational
decision making by lenders and subborrowers was achieved since interest rate controls were
abolished in 1995 and banks were permitted to charge differential rates to clients; (b) the
objectives of expanding term lending facilities in Taka and US dollars and supporting private
sector development by providing subloans were achieved jointly through implementation of
the line of credit component (a total of US$ 23.95 million equivalent was disbursed through
four FIs for the financing of 61 industrial projects); and (c) the objective of developing
environmental standards and guidelines for selected industries was achieved through
implementation of the environment component (part I, para. 5).
6.    Two main problems arose during implementation. In the first year of the project, two
of the four FIs initially identified as potentially eligible to participate in the project did not
meet the eligibility criteria after the partial enforcement by BB of the classification and
provisioning guidelines introduced for the first time under the FSAC. As a result of this
reduced number of eligible FIs, the lower economic and industrial sector growth than
initially envisaged, and the use by Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs) of their excess
liquidity to increase their term lending operations, the utilization of PSIC funds was
substantially below target. This led to the PSIC being declared a problem project in
September 1994. A second problem was the delay in implementing the environment
component because of the long process required to hire consultants. Both problems were
overcome by amending the DCA to: (a) allow leasing companies to participate under the
line of credit; and (b) revising the timetable for implementation of the environment
component (part I, para. 6).
7.    Once the DCA was amended, the project pipeline increased substantially. The line
of credit was fully committed by June 30, 1997, and by January 31, 1998, total
disbursements under it reached US$23.95 million equivalent or 96 percent of the total (see
Annexes I-IV for details on FIs and subloans). The line of credit supported the development
of four FIs, which increased their share in long term lending in the overall financial system
from 12 percent to 20 percent between FY 95-96 and FY 96-97. Although most subloans are
at the initial stage of implementation, the results to date show that these subloans are meeting
the targets established during their appraisal by the PCIs and their collection performance is
high (overdue installments on these subloans represent 1.6 percent of the installments due)
(part I, paras.7-8).
8.    The environment component was also fully implemented according to the revised
timetable. By April 1996 the study had been completed, and by October 1996 the
Department of Environment (DOE) had implemented the procedures for monitoring and
recording emissions in selected industries on a trial basis. Furthermore, the new standards
and guidelines prepared under the PSIC for four industrial subsectors were approved by the
GOB in August 1997 (part I, para. 8).
9.    Project Cost, Financing, and Time Schedule - The project cost was estimated at
US$50.7 million during appraisal and the actual cost was about US$48.3 million (Table 5).



v
The project became effective on March 22, 1993, nine months behind schedule. Despite
delays in project implementation, the project was closed as originally scheduled on
September 30, 1997.
10.   Project Sustainability - The project is considered sustainable, with a moderate long
term impact in increasing term financing. The reasons are as follows: (a) the deregulation of
interest rates has had a beneficial impact in the development of term lending; (b) the
strengthening of eligible FIs contributes to the development of high quality term financing;
and (c) two of the PCIs -- IDLC and ULC -- which accounted for about 38 percent of the
subloans under the line of credit are raising funds from the market through public placement
of shares (i.e. IDLC) and medium and short term loans from local banks. However, the
following constitute major impediments for raising funds by FIs in particular Non-Bank
Financial Institutions (NBFIs): (a) underdevelopment of the bond market; (b) competing
government savings schemes offering non-market terms and conditions; and (c) weak
regulatory framework for term lending activities (part I, para. 12).
Il.   IDA and Borrower Performance - The project cycle from identification to Board
presentation was carried out satisfactorily by IDA. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)
addressed adequately the links between private sector term financing needs, FIs and overall
financial sector reform. One shortcoming of the project was that, during appraisal, four FIs
seemed to meet the eligibility requirements under the line of credit, but only two remained
eligible after reclassifying their portfolios to comply with new prudential norms by BB (para.
13). This shortcoming led to problems in ensuring the required project pipeline during the
first two years of project implementation. Project supervision by IDA is rated highly
satisfactory. As a result of close supervision, IDA was able to take prompt and appropriate
action to ensure successful implementation including: (a) amending the project to
incorporate leasing companies in order to ensure better utilization of the line of credit; and
(b) designing a system of overcommitments within the approved subtotal for each Fl to
reduce undisbursed amounts by the end of the grace period for disbursements (para. 14).
Overall Borrower performance was also satisfactory. The GOB and in particular BB
undertook all the necessary steps and collaborated closely with IDA during project
preparation and implementation. Albeit with some delays, all covenants were complied
with, substantially before completion of the project (para. 15).
12.   Future Operations, Findings, and Lessons Learned - With the growth of NBFIs
during recent years and the initial development of capital markets in Bangladesh, the issue
that has arisen is how to assist the Government in increasing the volume and quality of term
financing through NBFIs, in order to contribute to the speed and efficiency of industrial
growth. To achieve this objective and build on the PSIC achievements, IDA is considering a
follow-up operation to support NBFI development through : (a) strengthening their
regulatory framework; (b) assisting in developing their funding sources; and (c)
strengthening their term lending and fund raising capabilities (part I, para. 17).
13.   The PSIC provided the following key lessons (part 1, para. 18):



vi
a) In the absence of adequate institutional capacity by the implementing agency, IDA should
recognize the need to: (i) allocate greater amount of resources for supervision and
assistance to ensure success in implementation, and (ii) limit the number of objectives to
increase the possibility of success. Part of the success of the PSIC can be attributed to the
application of these principles.
b) Financial statements of financial institutions could be misleading when regulations are
inappropriate and/or lax, and therefore an in-depth analysis may be necessary when
adequate information is crucial for project design. Because this was not considered under
the PSIC, it led to implementation problems when FIs initially considered eligible were
disqualified later after regulations were strengthened.
c) The timetable for implementation of technical assistance components should be realistic,
taking into account the procedures and past experiences of the country. Also, attention
should be given during project design to agreeing on clear output indicators for technical
assistance activities. The experience under the environment component of the project
supports these points.
d) Projects should openly acknowledge those issues that cannot be addressed at that time but
merit attention at a later stage. The PSIC could have pointed out the desirability of
developing commercial paper and bond markets once capital markets developed in order
to increase sources of funding for institutions involved in term lending.

PRIVATE SECTOR INDUSTRIAL CREDIT (PSIC)
(IDA Credit 2340-BD)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.    Project Objectives - The objective of the Private Sector Industrial Credit (PSIC) was
to further financial sector reforms initiated by the Government of Bangladesh (GOB), while
promoting private sector development through financing private investments in productive
activities. Specifically, the project aimed at: (a) promoting more rational decision making
by lenders and subborrowers; (b) expanding term lending facilities in Taka and US dollars by
providing a line of credit to eligible financial intermediaries (FIs); (c) supporting private
sector development through subloans for industrial investments under a line of credit; and (d)
developing and applying environmental guidelines and standards for industry.
2.    Evaluation of Objectives and Background - The project objectives and its design
were in line with the GOB's priority reform programs at that time. In December 1987, IDA
completed a major sector study, "Bangladesh: A Program for Financial Sector Reform",
which identified substantial weaknesses in the financial system (interest rate determination,
financial viability of nationalized commercial banks, banking supervision, financial
disclosure and loss provisioning procedures, and debt recovery measures). The reform
program proposed in that study was supported by all major donor agencies. To support the
GOB's efforts in reviving the financial sector which had fallen into a critical state in the
1980s 1, IDA Board approved the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC; Cr. 2152-BD)
and the PSIC. The FSAC supported a broad reform program by the GOB consisting of
significant improvements in the areas of: (a) interest rate policy; (b) monetary policy; (c)
priority lending; (d) central bank supervision and regulation of banks; (e) strengthened
Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs); (f) improved debt recovery environment; and (g)
the capital market (FSAC MOP, Credit Summary). The GOB's strategy also aimed at: (a)
ensuring international competitiveness and balance of payment stability through flexible
exchange rate management and prudent borrowing; and (b) strengthening the financial
system by rehabilitating the development financial institutions (DFIs).
I From independence and until 1981 both the industrial and financial sectors of the Bangladesh economy
were tightly controlled by the Government and were dominated by public sector operations. In 1981, the
Government of Bangladesh introduced its New Industrial Policy that reversed the commitment to social
ownership and control, and in 1986, GOB's Revised Industrial Policy provided further steps in
deregulating private investment, trade liberalization, public enterprise privatization, and non-traditional
export promotion.



2
3.    The PSIC project was conceived to complement the financial sector policy actions
supported under FSAC, through measures aimed at achieving liberalization of interest rates
and improvements in loan collection procedures, while focusing on promoting and
developing industrial investment. Both the GOB and IDA believed that developing adequate
expertise in term lending was important for developing the banking system and that the
industrial sector remained the largest potential user of term financing as well as a major
source of employment and income generation. Only those financial intermediaries that met
certain eligibility criteria focusing on sound management and efficient lending were eligible
as participating credit institutions (PCIs). This measure was to avoid the poor performance
of past financial intermediation loans during the 1970s that had resulted from the use of DFIs
as financial interrnediaries.
B. Achievement of Objectives
4.    The project components included: (a) a US$25 million equivalent line of credit to FIs
that met eligibility criteria applied to their financial structure and performance; and (b) a
technical assistance component for US$0.5 million to the Department of Environment (DOE)
for the development and application of environmental guidelines and standards for industry.
In order to achieve successful implementation of the project, the following key agreements
were reached with the GOB: (a) to widen the domestic currency term lending rate band for
medium and large scale industry before effectiveness; (b) to study loan recovery procedures
through the legal system followed by recommendations to expedite recoveries and their
implementation; (c) to allow the use of differential rates to different clients and maturities to
reflect relative risk; and (d) to decontrol interest rates on foreign exchange loans issued in
Bangladesh. In addition, as a condition of credit effectiveness, the GOB agreed to execute
Subsidiary Loan Agreements acceptable to IDA with at least two PCIs, which should be in
compliance with BB and the Bank Company Act 1991 requirements on capital adequacy and
provisioning.
5.    The project objectives established under the PSIC were substantially achieved
despite major problems during the first years of implementation. Under the PSIC: (a) the
objective of more rational decision making by lenders and subborrowers was achieved since
the GOB interest rate controls were abolished in 1995 and banks were permitted to charge
differential rates to clients; (b) the objectives of expanding term lending facilities in Taka
and US dollars and supporting private sector development by providing subloans were
achieved jointly through implementation of the line of credit component (a total of US$
23.95 million equivalent was disbursed through four FIs for the financing 62 industrial
projects); and (c) the objective of developing environmental standards and guidelines for
selected industries was achieved through implementation of the environment component
(para. 8). Viewed under the narrow objectives of the project, the achievement of
macropolices - mainly interest rate liberalization - is rated as substantial (Part II, Table I).
6.    Problems related to implementation of both components arose during the first three
years of project implementation, which resulted in the PSIC being declared a problem
project in September 1994. The first problem was the low level of disbursements during the
first two years of the project. A second problem was the delay in implementing the



3
environment component. These problems were overcome by amending the DCA to allow
leasing companies to be eligible as FIs under the line of credit; under the same eligibility
criteria, and by revising the timetable for implementation of the environment component
which was already under implementation (para. 11).
7.    Once the DCA was amended, the project pipeline increased substantially. In order to
further increase disbursement performance under the credit line, each Participating Credit
Institution (PCI) was allowed an overcommitment margin to be used only in case some
subprojects suffered cancellation or were not fully disbursed by June 30, 1997. As a result of
these measures the line of credit was fully committed and by January 31, 1998, total
disbursements under the line of credit reached US$23.95 million equivalent or 96 percent of
the total. The two leasing companies, incorporated under the Project after the DCA
Amendment, accounted for 38 percent of disbursements under the line of credit component.
Annexes I-IV show major information on the PCIs and subloans under the line of credit. The
line of credit supported the development of four FIs, which increased their share in term
lending within the financial sector from 12 percent to 20 percent between FY 95-96 and FY
96-97. It is worth mentioning that the performance of these FIs was significantly higher than
most other financial institutions: as of June 30, 1997 their overdue long term loans
represented 6.5 percent of their portfolio compared to 34 percent for NCBs and 35 percent
for local private banks. Although most subloans are at the initial stage of implementation,
thereby precluding a proper impact assessment, the results to date show that these subloans
are meeting the targets established during their appraisal by the PCIs and their collection
performance is high (overdue installments on these subloans represent 1.6 percent of the
installments due).
8.    The environment component was also fully implemented in accordance with the
revised timetable. By April 1996, a report entitled "Study to Develop and Apply Sector-
Wise Industrial Guidelines and Standards for Environmental Protection and to Monitor
Compliance" had been completed under this component, and by October 1996 the
Department of Environment (DOE) had implemented the procedures for monitoring and
recording emissions in selected industries on a trial basis. Furthermore, the new standards
and guidelines prepared under the PSIC for four industrial subsectors were approved by the
GOB in August 1997.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
9.    Although the project objectives were achieved by the end of the project, this would
not have been possible without an amendment to the DCA to incorporate leasing companies.
The objective of expanding term lending facilities and promote private sector development
through subloans for industrial development was not achievable under the original project
because: (a) two of the four FIs initially identified as potentially eligible for a line of credit
under the project did not meet the eligibility criteria once the new classification and
provisioning guidelines under the FSAC were enforced by BB; (b) economic/industrial
sector growth during 1993-94 was lower than envisaged dampening investment demand; and
(c) Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs) were encouraged by BB to use their temporary



4
excess liquidity to substantially increase their term lending operations thus reducing potential
demand through the private FIs which are normally involved in project financing. These
problems were reflected in difficulties that arose during project implementation.
10.   By November 1995, over more than half the life of the project, only US$3 million
had been disbursed, or 17 percent of the original estimate. Furthermore, one of the two FIs
that initially met the eligibility criteria, no longer qualified. To address this problem, IDA
and the GOB agreed to amend the PSIC in order to include leasing companies, which were
experiencing a dynamic growth in lease financing activities and had expressed interest in
participating under the PSIC line of credit. The Amendment was signed in November 1995,
and the Commitment Date extended from March 31, 1997 to June 30, 1997, without
changing the Closing Date of September 30, 1997.
11.   A second problem that arose during implementation was the delay in hiring the
consultants to implement the environment component, to be initiated six months after
effectiveness (i.e. by September 1993) and finalized eighteen months after effectiveness
(September 1994). The DCA Amendment modified the timetable for this component to
start-up in October 1995 with completion by October 1996. The environment component
was fully implemented in accordance with the revised timetable.
D. Project Sustainability
12.   The project is considered sustainable, with a moderate long term impact in increasing
tern financing. The reasons are as follows: (a) the deregulation of interest rates has had a
beneficial impact in the development of term lending; (b) those FIs that met the eligibility
criteria have been strengthened through PSIC's line of credit ensuring that high quality term
financing will continue to grow in Bangladesh; and (c) two of the PCIs -- IDLC and ULC --
which accounted for about 38 percent of the subloans under the line of credit are raising
funds from the market through the issuing of shares in the Dhaka Stock Exchange (IDLC),
private placement of debentures, and securing medium and short term loans from local
banks. By supporting these PCIs, the Project increased their attractiveness to institutional
investors, and at the same time provided the PCIs with temporary funding to complement
their increasing reliance upon market sources of funds. However, there are still major
impediments to FIs -- in particular NBFIs for raising funds for term financing. These are:
(a) underdevelopment of bond markets; (b) competing government saving schemes offering
non-market oriented terms and conditions; and (c) weak regulatory framework for NBFIs.
These impediments are being addressed under a proposed Non-Bank Financial Institutions
Development Project (para. 17).
E. IDA's Performance
13.   The project cycle from identification to Board presentation was carried out
satisfactorily by IDA. Identification of the project was consistent with the GOB's
development strategy and IDA's strategy for Bangladesh, and specifically for the financial



5
sector. The project as conceived constituted an important complement to support the
policies under the FSAC. Preparation and appraisal were also satisfactory. The Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR) covered adequately those areas of the financial sector related to
private sector investment and its links with overall financial sector reform. The design of the
project was carried out with the required depth for both the line of credit and the
environmental technical assistance components. However, one shortcoming of the project
was that, although during appraisal four FIs seemed to meet the eligibility requirements
under the line of credit, only two qualified once the project was declared effective. The main
reason for this development was that BB's prudential norms issued in November 1989 forced
the banks to reclassify their portfolios. A more in-depth analysis of the financial statements
of the FIs during appraisal could have revealed the weaknesses of the two FIs that did not
qualify, although it should be acknowledged that such analysis was not normal Bank practice
at the appraisal stage. This shortcoming led to problems in ensuring the required project
pipeline during the first two years of project implementation.
14.   Project supervision by IDA is rated highly satisfactory. Throughout the life of the
project, IDA, in particular the Dhaka Office (DO), maintained close coordination with BB
and the FIs, which permitted the quick solution of problems as these arose. This was
especially valuable during the first years of project implementation, when the project was
amended to incorporate leasing companies. The DO ensured that the Amendment was
rapidly processed by the GOB and determined the interest and potential qualifications of the
leasing companies. Once the amendment was signed, IDA in coordination with BB
determined the eligibility of the leasing companies and provided orientation to the latter as to
the requirements for processing subproject requests. Finally, towards the end of the project,
when uncertainties arose as to whether all the approved subprojects could be disbursed
before the end of the grace period for disbursements (January 31, 1998), IDA designed a
system that permitted overcommitments, by which if a subproject under any FI would not be
disbursed, that same Fl could request disbursements against one of its subprojects approved
on a conditional basis. This mechanism allowed maximum disbursements under the PSIC.
IDA staff also maintained close contact with the DOE for implementation of the
environment component which resulted in its satisfactory implementation.
F. Borrower's Performance
15.   Overall Borrower performance was satisfactory. The GOB and in particular BB
undertook all the necessary steps and collaborated closely with IDA during project
preparation and implementation. The Borrower proceeded quickly with the DCA
Amendment that was required to incorporate leasing companies. The BB responded quickly
when IDA noted problems during project implementation. Although compliance with some
covenants took longer than usual, in particular implementation of the environment
component, all covenants were complied with, substantially before completion of the project.
Three noted weaknesses in GOB performance are beyond the scope of the project: (a) BB's
Non Bank Department in charge of implementing the line of credit possessed limited
manpower and therefore had to make substantial efforts with their scarce resources to ensure
success of the project; (b) although as agreed with IDA, the GOB completed the study on



6
improving loan recovery procedures through the legal system, the full implementation of the
recommendations including the appointment of full-time judges for the financial loan courts,
a key action for success, but which was beyond the scope of the project, did not take place
until recently; and (c) the industrial pollution guidelines were valuable as paper regulation,
but have not been broadly implemented even following formal notification to industry in
August 1997.
G. Assessment of Outcome
16.   The outcome of the project is rated satisfactory since the project components were
almost fully implemented (disbursement of the line of credit was 96 percent of the total) and
its development objectives were achieved.
H. Future Operations
17.   The PSIC achieved concrete and substantial results for the development of term
financing in Bangladesh (para. 6). At the time the PSIC was designed it would have been
perhaps premature to address the development of commercial paper and bond markets since
a capital market had not been established. With the growth of NBFIs during recent years and
the initial development of capital markets in Bangladesh, the issue that has arisen now is how
could IDA assist the Government in increasing term financing through NBFIs, in order to
improve the quality of intermediation and contribute to the speed and efficiency of industrial
growth. To achieve these objectives, IDA is considering a follow-up operation that would
include: (a) strengthening the regulatory framework for NBFIs; (b) assisting in the
development of funding sources for NBFIs; and (c) strengthening term lending and fund
raising capabilities of NBFIs.
I. Key Lessons Learned
18.   The PSIC provided the following key lessons:
a) In the case of weak institutional capacity by the implementation agency and the
difficulty to improve such capacity during the time scope of the project, IDA should
recognize the need to: (i) allocate more resources for supervision and assistance to ensure
success of the project, as was done for this project. IDA's close coordination with the
Government and FIs, in particular the assistance provided by the Dhaka Office allowed
the project to be implemented successfully (paras. 14-15), and (ii) limit the project focus
to a reduced number of objectives with few components to increase the chance of
success. This was the case under the PSIC, which permitted close coordination between
IDA, the Government and FIs and the quick removal of impediments to the project
progress (paras. 14-15).
b) In the absence of an adequate regulatory framework for the financial system, the
financial statements for financial institutions could be misleading, and therefore an in-



7
depth analysis of the financial institutions may be necessary when adequate information
is crucial for project design. Because this was not considered under the PSIC it led to
implementation problems when two of the four FIs that appeared to be potentially
eligible under the credit line, showed an unsatisfactory financial performance after BB's
new regulations were enforced (para. 9).
c) The timetable for implementation of technical assistance components should be realistic,
taking into account the procedures and past experience of the country. Because this
factor was not considered for the technical assistance under the environment component
of the project, appointment of the required consultants was delayed way beyond the
initial deadline leading to a substantial revision of the implementation timetable (paras.
6, 8). Also, attention should be given during project design to agreeing on clear output
indicators for technical assistance activities.
d) Projects should openly acknowledge those issues that cannot be addressed under that
operation but need to be covered at a later stage. In that sense, the PSIC could have
pointed out the desirability of developing the market for commercial paper and bonds,
once capital markets developed, in order to increase funding sources for institutions
involved in term lending (para. 17).

AIDE MEMOIRE
PRIVATE SECTOR INrDUSTRIL CREDIT
EVILEMNEN'TATION CO:N?LETION REPORT
Appendix B
1.    An Implemention Completion Report (ICR) mission for the Private Sector
Lndusuial Credit (PSIC), which closed on September 30, 1997, visited Bangladesh frm
November 19 to 26,1997. The mission was composed of Messrs. Alifedo Dammert
(Task Team Leader, SASFP) and Shamsuddin Ahmad (Financial Analyst, DFO). IThe
mission held meetings with the Mviinistry of Finance, Bangladesh Bank (BB), the
Deparment of Environment (DOE), the Economic Relations Deparcent (ERD) and the
financial inmediaries under the cadir (Aaachment I).
nThe PSIC supevision mission of March 1997 met with the Geneal Manager of
thc ndustial CreditDeparetnofBB to dis.uss the st:ps to bctakenforprepnaationof
the ICR. The mission indicated that the ICR w-as to be finalized not lae than six monhs
after the Closing Date as per IDA requirements. It also provided the General vanage of
BB with the guidelines to prepare the Borrower's contibution to the ICR-and requesed
him to send a preiminary draft to IDA, including the operational plan and indicators on
imolenentation performance of the PSIC. In July 1997, the BB provided IDA wiih the
requested ooerarional plan together with a table on the starus of subprojecrs. The ICR
mission fuirther recuested to the General lanazer of BB-rhat the Government's
contrioution to the ICR be presented at it ealicst convemienc:, but not later tha end
Dexumber 1997.
Sraztt of the Project
; .    Projecr Componenis. Tnc two project components of PSIC are: (a) a line of
c.--iz of UISSS5 million ecuivalent to finance industria. invertments through eligible
nar.c.ial intermediaries (FrIs); and (b) a tecnicai assistanct component for USS0.5
miLlior e'uivaienL to devcip c.-nironmcnrtl guidehincz for 'siecrd industrial subsecwors
4 .    Line of Credit Component. As of October31, 1997, the linc of crdit has been
full.v commirted but only USS 16.2 million disbursed. Tne mission recommended to BB to
make all efforts to submitwithdrvwal applications to IDA for all the pcnding eligible
disbixsemrnent recuests presented bv the Fls. Full utilization would support the high
dc-.and for tenr finiancing for wv;ich the GOB has reuested an additional line of credit
from iDA. Tne mission noted tht if all these pending disbursbcnet rcquests were
submitted to IDA before the dedline of January 31, 1 99S, tota disbursement under the
line of credit component would amount to USS-3 milliorL The mission made it clear to
BB that IDA would not be able to disburse any amounts after such dcadline
5 .    Financial rntermediaries and their Subprojects. The various IDA supwervsion
missions have visited most subprojects under PSIC. In general terms it has been
observed that almost all subprojects are beingimplemented on schedule and those alreadY
operating are functioning in linc with the original plans. The inspeotion reports on tes



32
visits are on file at IDA headq1zarters and the DFO. rhe ICR misson met with the lsto
request detailed information concerning the impact of th subprojects ( ac  
The Fls indicated that it is stil too eary to measmre the nill impact of the x*iWjeM
since only a few have been filly implemented for which bull impact dam is now availablkg.
Mlost of the subprojecmts have either bee recently impl==ted or are ctwedy umder
implementation and therefore meaningful datz for these would not be available umil aI
the ICR has been finsalized The mission requested BE to complete as much in-ozmatoa
on the impact of the suborojects from the Fls as is possible i.mder these ciumn
The mission also asked the Fis about any major issues that may have affected project
implementatlon. Their response was that the onlyl maJor issue was the delay at BB in
processing their reimbursement requcsts
6.    Environment Component. Concerning implemen-mtion of the environment
component, this had been fully implemented as of Octber 1. 1996 in accordance witt thc
revised fullillment date under PSIC lesal covenants. The DOE informed the mission th
the draft on standards and guidelines for industial pollution prepared undr the PSIC was
approved by the GOB in A    1997. This is a si ifican: developmen since it will
provide DOE with the appropriate legal framework to e:nrc- such standards. The
mission mquetted the DOE Director that DOE provide its contribution to the ICR on the
implementation of the environment component. -
7.    The mission aegred uith the GOB and the FIs tha: overall the project objectives
had been scesssllsv met. Althouzh the rroject faced a slow start, because all Ehe
commercial bank-s initially considered cligibi failed to conEinue meeting the eligibility
criteria and oniv one FI remained eligible, mleientaion oicked up when the GOB
a-red to tne supervision mission s proposal to include I::sing companies as eliible
under the PSIC. Also, implementation of the environment component, which wvas
delaved due to difficulties in armointinc the consultants. was successfullv implemented
under the revised timenabic acreed between the GOB and IDA.
S.    The mission informed the GOB that IDA would send a draft ICR bv Januazy 31,
1998 for the GOB's cc=ents and tiat the-fnal ICR would be prepared before March
31. 199S. It aiso requested the followinr:
* BB to present its contribution to the [CR not later &t= Decezmberi 31, 1997 (para ).
* BB to expedite the uithdrawal appiications for all pending reimbursemcnt requests by
the FIs (parm. 4).
*  BB to ensur that the FIs comicte the information r::nuired by IDA for preparatio of
the ICR not later than Dec:nber 15, 1997 (pam 5).
*  Tne DOE to provide separately its conuibution to the ICR on the implementation of
the enironment component not later than December 5., 1997 (par. 6).
