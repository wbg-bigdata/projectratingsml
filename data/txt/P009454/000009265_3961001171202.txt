MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A PRIVATE SECTOR INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Bangladesh for SDR 18.3 million (US$25.5 million
equivalent), on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, is submitted for
approval.  The proposed credit would help finance an industrial investment
credit project in which funds would be made available to private industrial
firms by banks with majority private ownership and by an IFC affiliate.
(Banks that do not have majority private ownership could also be considered
for participation when they meet project eligibility requirements). The
Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh (GOB) would relend US$25.0
million equivalent of the proceeds of the credit to participating credit
institutions (PCIs) in US dollars or in Taka, as requested by PCIs to fund
subloans in each currency, respectively. The cost of funds to the PCIs and to
subborrowers would be essentially market-based. US$500,000 equivalent would
finance technical assistance to the Department of Environment (DOE) of the
Ministry of Environment and Forests for the dovelopment and application of
environmental guidelines and standards for manufacturing processes.
2.          Background.  From 1972 until 1981 both the industrial and
financial sectors of the Bangladesh economy were tightly controlled by the
Government and were dominated by public sector operations. However, in 1981,
COB issued its New Industrial Policy which, drawing upon the findings of an
IDA-funded Trade and Industrial Policy reform study, reversed the commitment
to social ownership and control. In 1986, GOB's Revised Industrial Policy
signalled further steps in deregulating private investment, and GOB declared
its aim to continue with trade liberalization, public enterprise privatization
and non-traditional export promotion. A related aim was to ensure
international competitiveness and balance of payments stability through
flexible exchange rate management and prudent borrowing. The strategy also
expressed GOB's intent to strengthen the financial system by rehabilitating
the development finance institutions (DFIs), taking stern action against
defaulters and gradually establishing a more autonomous, efficient banking
system. This policy was fully supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
IDA and other multilateral and bilateral donors. With support from ADB and
IDA under their respective industrial sector operations, GOB has made
considerable efforts to translate policy formulation into concrete reform
measures by liberalizing the tariff structure, removing quantitative
restrictions on imports, adjusting exchange rate policy, providing export
financing and relaxing investment approval requirements. With these measures
and tI'e privatization of a number of state-owned enterprises, GOR'a share of
industrial f;xed assets has been reduced from 90? in 1972 to about 40? by
1990. However, while progress has been continuous, much more needs to be
done, and steps are underway by both ADB and IDA to strengthen the reform
process initiated under earlier sector operations, particularly through
actions focused upon private sector development.
3.          In parallel with the reform of trade and industrial policy, both
ADB and IDA have worked closely with GOB to improve the efficiency of



-2-
industrial financing by promoting credit for small, medium and large scale
enterprises through both the nationalized commercial banks and two state-owned
DFIs. However, these operations relied upon the institutional capacity of the
participating financial institutions and ignored the major constraints to
financial sector efficiency, including directed credit, distorted interest
rate determination, inadequate debt recovery measures, and an undeveloped
capital market. These constraints were exacerbated by political pressure on
credit allocation and additional charges in the approval and collection
process. Notwithstanding the considerable efforts of ADB, IDA, UNDP and other
donors to work with GOB to remove these constraints, little or no progress was
achieved in developing a coherent sectoral development strategy, and since
1980 IDA has not approved any new industrial financing operations. However,
in Decemoer 1987 IDA completed a major sector study, "Bangladesh: A Program
for Financial Sector Reform," which addressed weaknesses in interest rate
determination, financial viability of nationalized commercial banks, banking
supervision, financial disclosure and loss provisioning procedures, and debt
recovery measures. The reform program proposed in that study is supported by
all major donor agencies.
4.          Lessons from Previous IDA Operations.  From the early 1970s to the
mid-1980s IDA approved eight financial intermediation operations aimed at
(a) financing small, medium and large scale industry in both the state and
private sectors; and (b) upgrading the institutional capacity of participating
financial institutions. Three of the operations (Credits 353-BD, 825-BD and
1065-BD) were designed to promote credit to small scale industry through
nationalized commercial banks; two operations (Credits 632-BD and 1117-BD)
were channelled through a public sector DFI, while two other operations
(Credits 1205-BD and 1477-BD) for the restructuring of the textile sector
channelled funds through the country's two state-owned DFIs. Despite
significant effort by IDA (and by other donors, e.g., ADB and KfW on related
projects), project implementation was poor, and there were no sustained
improvements in the operational efficiency of the financial institutions
involved. Against this background, IDA (and other major donors) withdrew from
this area of operation.
5.          Major problems resulted from a complex set of factors.  One was
formula lending, using a 202 equity and 80 debt ratio, and interest rates
that were subsidized. This stimulated opportunistic loan applications because
the 20Z equity, including the value of land already owned, required relatively
little borrower commitment. The lending institutions had difficulty
separating good from bad prospects, and apparently had diminished incentive to
do so because, reportedly, both borrower and lender engaged in rent-seeking
activities. A second factor was a cultural, social and political reluctance
by state-owned lenders to foreclose, complicated by lengthy and costly legal
procedures for the realization of security. Third, lenders were relatively
inexperienced in term lending. Their data base was small and of sometimes
dubious quality because of traditions of nondisclosure by businessmen and the
absence of reliable accounting and auditing information.
6.          These problems are being diminished in -ope with financial sector
reforms under implementation which are rationalizing interest rates and



- 3 -
simplifying legal procedures required for the realization of security.
Conditions attached to and components of the proposed project address both
interest rate and legal issues. The tradition of formula lending remains
strong, but the three private banks participating in the project tend toward
more conservative ratios tempered by cash flow analysis. These lenders have
policies and procedures that permit faster self-correcting measures to be
devised and implemented, and they are more selective of their clients than are
state-owned financial institutions.
7.          The implementation of the trade and industrial policy reform
program under the FY87 Industrial Sector Project (Credit 1816-BD), with its
private sector development focus, created opportunities for industrial
financing. To provide a sound basis for lending, a comprehensive financial
sector reform program (based upon the 19i9 sector study) was initiate4 in 1990
under a Financial Sector Credit--FSC--(Credit 2152-BD) which targeted:
(a) macrofinancial policy reforms of interest rates and interest rate
subsidies, movement toward indirect controls and reimbursement of loans gone
sour made to poorly performing state-owned enterprises; (b) central bank
supervision of the banking system; (c) nationalized commercialized banks,
accounting, management systems, and losses; and (d) other measures dealing
with the legal framework for debt recovery, banking regulations and capital
markets. To date, progress has been satisfactory, albeit somewhat behind
schedule.
8.          Rationale for IDA's Involvement.  As part of its strategy for
supporting GOB's industrial and financial reforms, IDA has been preparing two
operations which will place special emphasis on further trade and industrial
policy liberalization and on financial sector efficiency. A Second Industrial
Sector Adjustment Credit (scheduled to be negotiated later in FY92) will
demonstrate IDA's continued support for GOB's commitment to industrial reform,
while the proposed Private Sector Industrial Credit Project would channel
long-term funds for private industrial development through banks with majority
private ownership and an IFC affiliate.
9.          Lending Focus.  The project provides funds for private industrial
investment, attempting to price these on a market-oriented basis. The primary
rationale for focusing on industrial investment is that expertise in term
lending is important for the development of the banking system and industry
probably constitutes the largest potential user of commercial bank term funds
as well as being a major source of employment and income. A secondary
rationale is that the project requires an organizational focus for managerial
reasons, and industrial lending offers such an orientation.
10.         Project Objectives.  The proposed Project would build on GOB's
policy reforms in industry and in finance, which have improved the lending
environment and reduced risks. In industry, it would promote private sector
development by placing banks not dominated by GOB shareholdings in a better
position to make term loans to private firms. The Project would select as
intermediaries banks that have demonstrated effective performance. Four have
been identified, and more may be selected, whether they are state-owned or
privately owned, if and when they meet eligibility criteria. With respect to



- 4 -
financial policy, the Project supports and hastens reform by including actions
to widen the interest rate band, specified by Bangladesh Bank, within which
term lending rates for medium and large industry can be established by banks,
and by requiring a study of how delays in realization of claims against
defaulters can be diminished.
11.         Proiect Description.  The proposed Project, which would be
inplemented over a five-year period, would further reforms supported bv the
FSC by providing a US$25.0 million line of credit to selected financial
intermediaries for term lending to industrial firms, by conditions attached to
the pricing of these funds for and by intermediaries, by introducing US dollar
subloans for subborrowers who seek such facilities, and by determining the
project's impact on the capital and on the term structure of the loan
portfolios of the PCIs. Project funds would be fully utilized by the sixth
year.  The Project would provide technical assistance for development and
application of environmental guidelines and standards. The Project would have
the following components: (a) a line of credit to eligible PCIs to finance
investments in goods, services and civil works by industrial enterprises in
which private investors have a majority holding; and (b) technical assistance
for DOE to: (i) develop environmental guidelines and standards for industry;
and (ii) carry out environmental screening and impact assessment of industrial
investment projects, inc'uding subprojects under the proposed Project, and to
monitor effluents of three industrial subsectors to be selected by GOB.
12.         Actions Agreed.  The key agreements reached with GOB include:
(a) the widening of the domestic currency term lending rate band for medium
and large scale industry before effectiveness and each year thereafter over a
period of five years, maintaining the relevant shadow market rate as the
midpoint of the band; (b) a study of loan recovery procedures through the
legal system, and recommend and implement changes to expedite recoveries;
(c) the use of differentiated rates to different clients for otherwise similar
transactions and for different subloan maturities to reflect relative risk;
(d) an undertaking from BB to calculate on a semi-annual or more frequent
basis, beginning with the semester closing on June 30, 1991, the weighted
average cost to private banks of fixed deposits having original maturities of
90 days or more; (e) the decontrol of interest rates on foreign exchange loans
issued in Bangladesh; and (f) the establishment of environmental guidelines
and standards for industry, and the mowiitoring of effluents of three
industrial subsectors, to be selected by GOB, against these guidelines and
standards; and performing subproject environmental assessments where these are
required and monitoring subproject compliance with environmental regulations
where these exist. In addition to (a)-(c), as a condition of credit
effectiveness, GOB has agreed to execute Subsidiary Loan agreements acceptable
to IDA with at least two PCIe, which are in compliance with Bangladesh Bank
and Bank Company Act 1991 capital adequacy and provisioning requirements.
13.         Environmental Impact.  The project provides that PCIs would rate
the likely impact of subprojects using the three-category (A through C) IDA
classification and forward this information along with a subproject summary to
the Department of the Environment. DOE may not always have the capacity to
perform a meaningful screening because of gaps In its guidelines and



standards.  To help remedy this situation the project provides technical
assistance funds for consultants to help develop and apply guidelines and
atandards and for equipment used in monitoring and analysis.
14.         Poverty Alleviation and Women in Development.  Although jobs
created through subproject investments will help alleviate poverty and
subloans will ble available to women, these concerns are not otherwise directly
addressed by this project.
15.         Benefits.  The project supports and furthers GOB's efforts to
liberalize the financial system, which should eventually produce great social
and economic benefits. The credit line will deliver benefits through the
financing of private investments. It will lengthen the term structure of the
financial market, promote adjustable rate Taka term lending and introduce US
dollar lending by financial institutions in Bangladesh for domestic
investment, promoting access to term finance by the private sector. The TA
supporting the development and application of envirotmental guidelines and
standards will assist assessment of the risk to the environment from
industrial processes.
16.         Risks.  The major Project risk is that PCIs will lose money on
subloans because of inexperience, an operating environment in which it has
been very difficult to develop banks that are viable by commercial criteria,
competition from nationalized financial institutions, poor client selection
and insider abuse. Attempts to manage these risks are included in this
Project and in continuing affirmation of financial reforms supported by the
FSC. However, term lending in Bangladesh remains risky. Risk to the natural
environment arises from a lack of clear-cut pollution control legislation,
inadequate monitoring and rent-seeking behavior. The Project attempts to
assist a process that will diminish these risks over time.
17.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend its
approval by the Executive Directors.
