MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A SECOND HEALTH AND POPULATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 19.5 million (US$27.0
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit will be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance a second health and
population project. US$0.8 million of the proposed credit will be passed to
the National Catholic Secretariat (NCS) and $0.3 million to other mission
hospitals for hospital equipment and maintenance; and US$2.8 million to the
Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana (PPAGI and $0.1 million to other NGOs
for family planning, all on grant terms.
2.        Background and Strategy.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) is
responsible for the largest part of health and family planning service
delivery in Ghana, but with strong support from NGOs: mission health
facilities (NCS being the largest) and population NGOs (PPAG being the
largest). MOH and most of its services are functioning poorly. While there
has recently been encouraging progress in immunization, and maternal and child
health coverage is fair, there are major problems of health organization and
management, drug supply, limited access in rural areas, finance and manpower;
and contraceptive prevalence has not taken off. MOH's planning and
implementation capacities are very limited at present. Many aid-financed
projects have lagged. High levels of Government have become concerned to
improve matters. A Bank population, health and nutrition sector review
(Report No. 7597-GH dated March 31, 1989) recommended a sector reform program,
covering policy, institutional and program changes, and revitalizing the
family planning effort. The Government has accepted the recommendations of
the sector review.
3.        The ongoing Health and Education Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1653-
GH) was approved in December 1985. Its many components cover a first group of
identified needs, especially: drug supply; rehabilitation of facilities for
delivering primary health care and combating malnutrition; training; and
studies of health policy, finance and manpower. Implementation was very slow
for some time, but has now speeded up somewhat. Most of the US$4 million
remaining balance will be committed in the next few months. The original
closing date will be extended by one year to December 31, 1991 to finalize
disbursements. Project implementation has shown the importance of borrower
commitment, simple design (especially minimizing the number of separate
procurement actions and in particular civil works contracts) and adequate
staffing for project implementation.
4.        Ghana is engaged in a program of structural adjustment.  One element
of this program is an improvement in the allocation and efficiency of use of
public sector resources. In addition, the Government is increasing the
emphasis on social sectors at this stage of the program as one important way
to improve the social indicators as well as the conditions of vulnerable
groups. In the health sector, it has embarked on a reform program aimed at
rapidly improving the quality and coverage of services. This program



- 2 -
emphasizes the key areas of expansion and strengthening of primary health
care; procurement and distribution of supplies; institutional development; and
human resource development. In population, the Government aims to address the
long-run development issues through inter alia an expansion of the family
planning program. IDA is supporting the reform and expansion efforts in both
health and population through comprehensive sector work (completed in 1989);
public expenditure reviews; promotion of a program to advance MOH's sector
priorities; and financing of key inputs under the proposed project.
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project will further the
Government's and IDA's strategy in the sector outlined above. High levels of
the Government and core agencies seek IDA input into reforms and into
advancing the key sector priorities.  IDA through its broad view of the
sector, involvement with the economy-wide reform program including public
expenditure reviews, and ability to finance a wide range of inputs across the
sector (including infrastructure for management) is well placed to help the
Government to see through its program. IDA will continue to cooperate closely
with other donors in these efforts. The project will also help in the
revitalization of Ghana's family planning effort, in concert with other
donors.
6.        Proiect Ob3ectives.  To bring about (i) a progressive improvement in
the quality and coverage of health services, and (ii) an increase in the
availability and accessibility of family planning services. These objectives
will be achieved largely through pursuing several key sector priorities
recently identified by Government: management and institution building;
expansion and strengthening of primary health care (including family
planning); and improvement in the supply system for essential drugs,
contraceptives and other medical supplies; and through the supply and
maintenance of hospital equipment.
7.        Project Description.  The project will support (a) a 1991-93 program
to implement MOH priorities in health and population, and (b) annual agreement
on the public sector expenditure program in health (annual MOH recurrent
budgets and three-year rolling public investment program in health). The
lending instrument is a sector investment credit, with a mid-term review.
Project components will support priority activities in four areas: (a) MOH
institution-building, including the district-level management of primary
health care and a prizes fund to motivate improved performance; (b) family
planning service expansion by MOH, PPAG and other NGOs; (c) drug and vaccine
supply and drug infrastructure rehabilitation; and (d) hospital equipment and
its maintenance for MOH, NCS and other mission hospitals in the three
northernmost regions. The project, to be carried out over five years,
provides funds for civil works; equipment, furniture and vehicles; drugs,
vaccines, contraceptives, supplies and materials; training; technical
assistance; and prizes.
8.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$34.4 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$24.5 million (71%). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule



- 3 -
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Ghana are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9029-GHA dated November 16,
1990, is also attached.
9.        The project has been sized, and its requirements kept simple, to
match implementation capacity. Arrangements were agreed at negotiations for
MOH's project management unit responsible for the project, and for MOH to
share implementation tasks with other beneficiaries and a procurement agency.
10.       Agreed Actions.  The implementation of an agreed program of actions
to further MOH priorities in health and population, and agreement on public
expenditure programs in health, will be the basis for IDA support through this
project. The major proposed conditions of different stages of processing ares
11.       Effectiveness:  (a) Full-time coordinator and full-time procurement
specialist for IDA-financed projects in place; (b) Signature of Government's
project agreements with NCS and PPAG with major provisions agreed with IDA,
including passing US$0.8 million equivalent to NCS and US$2.8 million
equivalent to PPAG out of the IDA credit as grants, and that the NGOs will
follow Bank guidelines in respect of proc-:rement and audit.
12.       Disbursement:  (a) For drug supply: Government competitive bidding
policy for drugs affirmed, advisory MOE tender committee established, and drug
cash and carry system effectively started; (b) For supply of hospital
equipment to MOH: MOH equipment maintenance engineer in place for project
regions; (c) For supply of contraceptives to MOH: national population
commission established.
13.       The main assurances agreed are that the Government will:
(a)  implement MOH priorities in health and population through
monitorable actions and a timetable agreed with IDA, notably:
(i)       PHC expansion program by December 31, 1991;
(ii)      expanded outreach services in all 10 regions by December
31, 1991;
(iii)     appointment of full-time district medical officers of
health to head district health management teams: 10 by
December 31, 1991, another 15 by December 31, 1992 and
another 15 by December 31, 1993;
(iv)      MOH-NGO framework agreement on activities in health and
population by June 30, 1991;
(v)       management information system design by December 31, 1991
and implementation by December 31, 1992; and
(vi)      staffing norms for health facilities by September 30,
1991, manpower master plan by March 31, 1992 and master
training program by June 30, 1992.
(b) agree annually with IDA the MOH recurrent budget and three-year
rolling public investment program in health;



- 4 -
(c) carry out a mid-term review with IDA by December 31, 1992; and
(d) cause NGOs to follow the Bank's guidelines for procurement,
reporting, and audit.
14.       Benefits.  The benefits would be a substantial improvement in health
service quality and coverage, especially for the poorer population; and a more
efficient supply of essential drugs and service provision. The project will
supply about 72 of Ghana's total drug needs in 1991-93, and enough vaccines to
immunize all 700,000 children born annually in 1992-94. The hospital
equipment will benefit 300,000 patients annually and indirectly a total
population of 3 million. The project will provide family planning services to
another 100,000 acceptors (one-third of current users) with multiple
demographic, health and other social and economic benefits.
15.       Risks.  The major risk is of insufficient MOH implementation
capacity, despite the limited project scope and simplified implementation
arrangements. This risk has been addressed through focusing on a manageable
number of sector priorities, the proposed reorganization of MOH headquarters,
through strengthening the MOH project management unit and sharing
implementation with the other beneficiaries and a specialized procurement
agency. A lesser risk is that of insufficient Government commitment to
implement the MOH sector priorities, especially allocating sufficient
resources to PHC and bringing about a major expansion of family planning
ptograms. This risk has been addressed through securing high-level Government
approval of MOH priorities in health and population; requiring agreement with
IDA on the public expenditure program annually; and coordinated donor support
for the Govarnment's population program.
16.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
