POPULATION AND HEAH PROJECT
ST-   APPRAIAL m
Loan and Prolect Summary
Borrowers                The Government of Jamaica
Beneficiaries:           The Ministry of Health, The National Family
Planning Board of Jamaica, and The Plaming
Institute of Jamaica
AMout:                   US$10.0 million equivalent
Tems:                    Payable in 17 years. with 4 years of grace. at the
Jank'a standard variable interest rate
Proje ct
Obiectives:    The principal objectives of the proposed project are to
assist the Government: (i) to achieve the objectives of the
National Population Policy (1983) namely fertility reduction
and the integration of population concern. in the public and
private sector development programs; and (ii) develop a more
cost-effective health services delivery system in line with
its Health Policy (1984).
Project
Description: The project would consist of three parts. Part A would
strengthen population and family plamning p'rogr-s through
technical assistance and program support for: popt-lation
informati-on in the Population Unit of tbe Planning Institute
of Jamaica; family planning service delivery in the Ministry
of Health; and information education and communication (II &
C) and social marketing of contraceptives (CSM) at the
National I3mily Planning Board. Part B would consist of
support for MOE efforts to improve the delivery of an
integrated package of services in outpatient facilities.
strengthen the referral system. and support the adoption of a
health financing scheme. Part C would support innovative
sub-projects designed to improve bealth and family planning
progrsas.
Project Benefits
and Risks:     Project benefits are expected to include an inerease in the
quantity and quality of famLly planning services provided by
MOR, a higher rate of contraceptive prevalence. increased
cost recovery and cost control capabilities in the MOM. and
improved management and referral systme in the MOH. The
main risks of the project are that contraceptive prevalence
may not reach the desirqd level because of the failure of
NMPBI PIOJ. and MOB to stimulate a greater deamad for family



plamning services, that the response of adolescents to the
new progrmsa may be weak, and that the MOH may not develop
the cspacity to respond to an incressed deumad for services.
A fuither rlak is that project implementation may be
constraeined by a further deterioration in the Jamaican
econamy. These risks would be addressed by strangthening
planning and management capabilities in the MOH, training PP
service providers. and upgrading of the service delivery
infrastructure. Government investments in the project have
been kept to a minimum, and some relief for Government
tbrough efficient cost-recovery should contribute to a
reduction in the financial impact of the project.

JAMAICA
POPLATION AND UALTH  PROJCT
STANI APRAISAL UPORT
I.  SOCI3CO-ZMC AND SECTOR BAC(GROUND
A. Socioeconomic Baclground
1.01      GeograpY. Jamaica has an area of about 11,000 kz2 and is the
third largest islsnd in the Caribbea. The island's topography is dominated
by a aountain range which runs from east to west with rivers flowing out of
the moutains to north and oouth. The large lowland area on the south coast
is the most productive agricultural region.
1.02      The People.  The population of Jamaica was estimated at 2.3
million ini dd-1985. Population dencity averages about 200 persons per km.2
although in the urban parish of Kingoton and St. Andrew the density is as
high as 1.630 persons per km2. The people of Jamaica are primarily of
African descent but there are people of Indian, Chinese and European origin
as well. Adult literacy was estimated at 90X (1984), however the school
drop-out rates are high, therefore this figure should be treated
circumspectly.
1.03      The IconX.  The GNP per capita in Jamaica was  istimated at
U..$940 in 1985, down from $1610 in 1984. Rlstorically, the Jamaican
economy was based on agriculture. During the 1960. tourism and bauzite
mining were developed and became major foreign exchange earners. Since
1980. Jamaica's balance of payments problems have been aggravated by sharp
declines in the quantities and price of bauxite exports. Inflation
Increased rapidly until 1984. when the Consumer Price Index rose by 282.
while wage increases averaged only about 152. The unemployment rate was
25.5Z that year atd has remained close to that level; the impact on the poor
of inflation and austerity measures has been severe. A series of
stabilisation plans involving Stand-By arrangements with the INF and
Structural Adjustment Loans from the Bank bave been approved to relieve
Jamaica's fiscal and economic problems. During the years 1985-1990.
economic growth is projected to average 2.32 per year. Nevertheless.
budgetary constraints will continue to limit the availability of funds for
public sector services.  In keeping with the government's austerity
program, the MOR will be required to limit investments and expenditures and
seek ways to increase the efficiency of their operations.
1.04      Environmental Conditions. Potable water is available thro'sghout
the country and a large proportion of the population has access to adequate
means of exereta disposal. This has contributed significantly to the
control of water and fecal-borne diseases. The Bank assisted First Rural
Development Program in Jamaica (1977) sought to address the need for
sanitary means of excreta disposal in rural areas with the construction of



-2-
over 6,500 pit latrines in Cornwall Cuunty. Seven percent of the total
population and 212 of the urban population are served by sewerage systems;
the rest of tue population use septic tanks, absorption pits, pit latrines
or the bush. Although Government recognizes the need for a wider
distribution of sewerage systems and package-sewage planta, construction has
been constrained by the resources available.
B. Population, Health and Nutrition Status
Population
1.05     Size and Projected Growth.  At the time of the 1962 census, the
population of Jamaica was 1.6 million. By 1970. the population had
increased to 1.9 million and by 1983. to 2.2 million. The annual rates of
growth in the intercensal periods 1960-1970 and 1970-1982 were moderate at
1.42 and 1.1% respectively, largely because of emigration. The population
grew at a faster rate (1.72) between 1982 and 1983 because emigration
declined by 562. If replacement level fertility is achieved by the year
2005. the population will grow to 2.8 million by the year 2000 and the labor
force (population age 15-65) will increase from 1.3 million in 1985 to
around 1.9 million In 2000. If there is no reduction in fertility, the
population will reach 3.5 million by the year 2000 and the labor force will
swell to 2 million. Annex I. Table 2.01 shows population projections.
1.06      Vital Rates.  Crude birth and death rates stand at around 28.8 and
7.0 per thousand respectively; the infant mortality rate (IMR) is around 27
per thousand; life expectancy is 70 years. Crude death rates (CDR) have
fallen steadilv in the past 20 years from 9 in 1960 to around 7.0 per
thousand in 1Vi83. In 1960 the crude birth rate (CBR) was very high at 40
per thousand, by 1983 it had declined to around 28.8. Jamaica's vital
indicators ere better than the Latin America - Caribbean (LAC) averages for:
life expectancy (60 years). CDR (10 per 1.000), IMR (76 per 1.000) and
maternal mortality rate (NWR) (100 per 100.000).  Some Jamaican indicators
compare favorably with the averages for industrialized economies, where life
expectancy averages 75 years. and the crude death rate about 9 per 1,000.
Jamaica's infant lund maternal mortality rates are considerably higher than
the rates in the industrialized countries; IMR is 27/1,000 compared to
10/1.000 and maternal mortality is 50 per 100.000, compared to 2/100.000.
(Annex I, Table 2.02.s
1.07     Age Distribution.  The proportion of the population under 15 years
of age increased from around 41% in 1960 to about 462 in 1970, then
decreased to 38% in 1982 due to reduction in fertility. The populati.on 65
years and over increased from around 6% to 82 during the same period, and
the median age of the population is around 20 years. The total number of
women in the reproductive age group (15-49 years of age) has grown from
497,000 in 1980 to 605.000 in 1935. and can be expected to increase to
between 800 and 900 thousand by 2000. The increase in the size of the
population 15-24 years of age will cause an increase in the absolute number
of births in spite of the declining fertility rates as these age cohorts



-3-
progress through the childbearing years. This underlines the need for a
more effective family planning effort and further reductions in the
fertility rate.
1.08      Fertility.  The 1975-76 Jamaica Fertility Survey estimated the
Total Fertility Rate (TFR) at 6.6 children per woman in 1960. Fertility has
declined significantly since 1960. to an estimated 3.5 children per woman in
1983 (urban 3.2 and rural 3.9). Women 15-19 showed the lowest decline in
age-specific fertility rates between 1975 and 1983. According to the
Registrar General. 252 of all women who gave birth to live-born children
between 1977 and 1982 were 19 years of age and under. and the mean age of
first live birth for current union women 15-19 years of age dropped from 19
years in 1977 to 16.4 years in 1983. Teenage pregnancy involves
unacceptable health and social risks for the young mother and her child
which are preventable when effective family planning programs are in place.
1.09      Marital Status.  Although legal marriage is recognized as the most
stable and acceptable form of union, representing 322 of all unions, other
forms of union, such as "visiting" (22X)3 and consensual or common-law union
(292) are important social institutions. The Jamaica Yertility Survey
(1976) found that fertility was highest in the more stable marriage and
common-law unions.  The survey also reveled that the median age at marriage
had declined in Jamaica. These conditions point to the need to encourage
more women in union to limit the size of their families and to delay the
first birth when the age of union is low.
1.10      Teenage Pregnancy Problem.  Teenage fertility is 2 to 13 times
higher in Jamaica than in the U.S. and selected Burcpean countries, and
fertility peaks at age 20-24, compared to 25-29 in industrialized
countries. According to the Contraceptive Prevalence Survey of 1983. 402 of
Jamaican women age 15-19 have one to two children before they reach the age
of twenty. Teenage pregnancy is a social and economic problem with
long-term consequences which often include early termination of formal
education. unemployment, social dislocation, and restrietion of women's
future opportunities and options. Estimates for 1983 showed that teenagers
15-19 accounted for over 282 of births and 442 of abortions. Teenagers have
the highest drop-out rate from family planning clinics. More than 502 of
teenagers cite dangers associated with using contraceptives as their reason
for not contracepting. The teennge pregnancy problem requires the design of
an effective information, education. communication and service delivery
program which will meet the special needs of this group.
1.11       Misration.  Emigration has been significant in checking the rate
of populationg-rowth in Jamaica since the early 1950s. Between 1960 and
1980. net migration varied between 20,000 and 30.000 annually. Emigration
fell sharply to just over 4.000 in 1983 because of the tightening of
immigration laws in the three countries (USA, Canada and United Kingdom)
which are the primary destination of Jamaican emigrants. The dramatic
decline in emigration will contribute to a higher rate of population growth
and increase pressure for additional employment opportunities, for housing.



-4-
educational facilities, and other social services such as health care. The
country, therefore, must intensify its efforts to attain replacement level
fertility to minimise the adverse effects of population growth.
Health
1.12      Status. There are no significant regional or urban/rural
differencea in morbidity and mortality patterns. Infectious and parasitic
diseases are no longer the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in
Jamaica. Chronic and degenerative diseases have become more prevalent. The
increase in resources invested in the health services. strict enforcement of
Public Health Laws, the successful eradication of malaria and yaws, and
social and economic gains have all contributed to significant improvements
in the health status of the population. (Annex I, Table 2.03)
1.13      Infant and Child Mortality. Congenital anomalies and perinatal
conditions are common causes of Infant mortality and reflect the high
fertility rates of older women and the high rate of teenage pregnancy.
Although diarrheal disease and respiratory conditions are not major causes
of death for other age groups, they are the leading causes of death in
children 1 to 5 years of age (whose death rate of 2 per 1.000 is
nevertheless not high). Protein calorie malnutrition continues to be a
health problem for children and may contribute to a greater proportion of
deaths among that group than is indicated by official statistics, because of
missed diagnosis. poor screening and/or underreporting.
1.14     Adu t Mortalit   Jamaica's death rate was estimated at 7.C. per
1,000 populatilon in 9B. Cause-specific mortality rates resemble those of
industrialized countries. where the leading causes of death for all ages are
cerebro-vascular conditions, heart disease and malignant neoplasms. The
most significant increase in mortality in recent years has occurred in the
category of accidents and violence.
Nutrition
1.15      Status. The nutrition status of infants and children in Jamaica
has improved since 1970. A comparison of the 1970 and 1978 national
nutrition surveys indicates that protein-calorie malnutrition is decreasing.
Between 1970 and 1978 the nutrition status of children under five improved
vith about 61.7X normal weight for age in 1978 as compared to 50.22 in 1970;
about 1S of under five children suffered from severe malnutrition in 1978
and 30.5% from mild degrees of malnutrition. Malnutrition was a primary
cause of hospital admission for approximately 52 of children under five
years of age who were admitted to urban hospitals, and in some rural areas
this figure was as high as 222. The cost of hospitalization of malnourished
children is higha in 1976. it was estimated at around $3 million per year.
Among the adult population, 55X of all pregnant and lactating women were
found to be anemic because of iron deficiencies which were attributed to
inadequate intake, low levels of absorption. short birth intervals and bigh
fertility.

C. Population. Health and Nutrition Policies and prorms
Population
1*16     Policies.  Jamaica was among the first countries in the Latin
American and CRibbean regions to become actively concerned with population
policy. In the 1930. family planning services were introduced by voluntary
agencies like the Jamaican lamily Planning Association, and after about 30
years of modest private efforts, a national program was officially
promulgated. In 1963. the Goverament introduced its Five-Year Independence
Plan and announced its intention to address problemo of rapid population
growth by encouraging emigration and introducing family planning services to
reduce fertility and improve health status. A National Family Planning
Board was established by the Government in 1967 to promote family planning
and deliver family planning services.
1.17      Fertility was reduced substantially during the intervening years.
but progress slowed during the 1980.. The Government's groing concern for
the lackluster resulto of recent efforts was reflected in the formulation of
a new Population Policy which the Bank considers to be a positive step in
the right direction. The population policy vas ratified by Parliament in
July 1983 and includes the following goal.s population not to exceed 3
million by year 2000; attainment of a two-chlld family by 1990; access to
high quality family planning services for all men and women of reproductive
age; continued improvement in life expectancy to around 75 years by year
2000; reduction in underemployment and unemployment in response to the
reduction in out-migration. achieving optimal spatial distribution of the
population. and satisfying housing, nutrition. education and environment
needs.
1.18      Programs and Services.  The Government's early population policies
were executed through a single purpose national family planning program
which was the responsibility of the National lamily Planning Board from 1967
to 1974. In 1974, the Government integrated family planning within the
service delivery network of MOH with mied results. The responsibilities of
the MOE and NFPB were not well defined and there was only limited commitment
to the new institutional arrangement by both parties. NFPB was to be
responsible for training, distribution of contraceptive supplies.
information. education and communication (INC) activities, processing of
family planning data end supervision and monitoring of the family planning
services. MOR was to deliver family planning services through its maternal/
child health and nutrition programs, and use other MOB facilities to meet
other family planning needs.
1.19      NEPB never felt comfortable with this alliance because previously
it had administered its own vertical service delivery program with its own
field personnel which were absorbed by the MOB. The NPPB continues to
implement other public and private sector family planning programs which
include 13 projects financed by USAID grant funds. These include programs
in the Ministries of Education, Youth and Community Developments



-6-
Agriculture. and private agencies such as YWCA. Operation Friendship, Family
Planitng Association of Jamaica, HEART (Human mployment and Resource
Training) and various other organizations.
1.20      A wide range of family planning services is provided by the MOH to
about 84.000 acceptor. per year (1982 figure"), an estimated 17X of tha
target population. Services include counseling snd contraceptives - pills.
condoms, IUDs, injectables, male and female sterilisation. The private
sector, including physicians, pharmacists and other retailers serve another
232 of women of reproductive age. The resultant contraceptive prevalence is
a modest 401 of all women of reproductive age and 552 of women in union.
1.21      There are several readily identifiable gaps in the family planning
service delivery strategy of the MOB. Comunity Health Aides who are the
major outreach personnel of the MOH have not been trained to provide VP
counseling or services. Some of the nurses in tba MOB facilities also lack
training in the provision of VP services. Many of the smaller health
centers do not have sufficient space for confidential counseling of family
planning clients or for physical examinations and services such as IUD
insertion. The MOR has given priority to the institutionalization of the
primary health care program. which in turn has affected MOH commitment to
family planning because the competing demauds for other health services have
overshadowed the MOE family planning efforts. The hospitals report a
five-month waiting period for tubal ligation. The procedure is only
performed in hospitalo under general anesthesia by physicians, the most
costly method of providing this service. In contrast. it is frequently
performed in the U.S. and other countries on an outpatient basis using local
anesthesia, a far more economical alternative. The shortage of MOE
physicians who can perform tubal ligations and the lack of adequately
equipped outpatient facilities which could be used are cited by MOH
officials as major reasons for the inadequate response to the demand.
1.22      Recently a Population Unit was established in a new Population,
Health and Manpower Division in the Planning Institute of Jamaica. The unit
has been engaged in developing a population modeling plan for the benefit of
certain key ministries, such as Education. Youth and Community Development.
Agriculture, Social Security; it is also developing a general plan of action
for disseminating population information suitable for all levels of the
community.
Health
1.23      Policies. Jamaica's health policy is to develop a comprehensive
national health service that incorporates both public and private sectors
and provides the means whereby all Jamaicans can have access to the
services. supplies and facilities which will allow them to enjoy good
health. GWJ'e highest priority is to establish an effective primary health
care delivery system throughout the country and to increase the efficiency
of the secondary and tertiary levels of care. Increasing fiscal constraints
during the last ten years have gradually forced GOJ to recognixe the



-7-
importance of cost-effectiveness as a detenminant in health sector
planning. Sector objectives have been modlfied to include the goal of
improving the efficiency of health services in order to maintain universal
coverage of acceptable quality within the limits set by sector budget
allocatieons.
1.24      Services. The two principal providers of health care in Jamaica
are MOHE anithe-private sector. The MOM provides services in 28 hospitals
including one university hospital and 375 health centers (1/6.000
population). There are 6,063 beds, 2.7 beds per 1.000 population, a ratio
which compares well to other middle-income countries in the Western
hemisphere and is sufficient to meet the inpatient needs of the
population. In 1984. MOR facilities provided approximately 3.6 million
consultations, of which 2.3 million were for curative care and 1.3 million
for preventive care. This amounts to about 1.6 bealth contacts per person
per year including sttention by doctors and other bealth care providers.
Primary bealth care services accounted for 2 million contacts, or 55% of
ambulatory visits, while the hospitals treated 45% of outpatients. The MDO
estimates that 902 of the population has access to the ministry's primary
health care program, but only 602 take advantage of the preventive services
offered. In 1982, immunizations were complete for only 502 of children
under one year. Only 202 of pregnant women received prenatal care before
the 16th week of pregnancy, 352 of new motbers received postnatal care. and
402 of all newborns received well baby care.
1.25       The private sector provided 1.8 million ambulatory care visits in
physicians' offices in 1980. Private hospital beds (280) account for 62 of
the beds available excluding the psychiatric hospital. According to surveys
done by the University of West Indies, only 32 to 72 of the population can
afford these services. Although health insurance is available, only an
estimated 252 of private sector services are covered by insurance.
1.26      Human Resources.  The total number of physicians practising in
Jamaica is about 720, of which 462 are employed in the Ministry of Health.
The physician/population ratio is 2.7 per 10,000 which is low compared to
other Caribbean islands with similar health profiles such as Trinidad and
Tobago (5.0 per 10,000) and Barbados (8.5 per 10.000). The low salaries
earned by MOH physicians when compared to their potential private sector
incomes and attractive opportunities overseas have caused a high turnover
rate among physicians employed by the MOR. There are about 1.480 registered
public bealth nurses and nurse practitioners in the country or a ratio of
11.8 per 10.000 population. The professional nurses also have a high
turnover rate and are in short supply in the public sector. The MMO has
vacant positions for pbysicians and nurses throughout the system. Low pay
and poor working conditions as well as a diminishing number of posts in
higher grades account for the high turnover. A large number of nursing
staff either accept overseas positions or enter better paid non-nursing
positions in the private sector. Questions of career development, salary
incentives and their implications in tenms of staff productivity and
attrition of key personnel must be addressed. The Government is developing



-8-
a complete information data base on public sector heblth manpower with
assistance from USAID. This data base will provide informetion for future
planming and management of health manpower development. The Administrative
Reform program which the Bank is assisting (1985 Tecbnical Assistance
Project Ln. 2507-3M) io also expected to contribute to reforms in the MOH
poronnel system.
1.27     Health Manpower Development.  Jamaica bas the institutional
capacity t9 train many types of health personnel with the exception of
dentists. The training of the doctors is undertaken at the University of
West lndies Medical School in Kingston. The number of Jamaican physicians
graduating each year bas remained constant at around 66 doctors per year
over the past five years. The closing of a nursing school in recett years
because of government financial constraints bas led to a reduction in output
of registered nurses from 303 to 131 per year between 1979-82. The output
from the training programs in terms of number and type of personnel is not
coordiasted with the needs of the public or private sector health system.
1.28      Sector Expenditures.  In 1981. public and private recurrent and
capital expenditures for bealth amounted to 7.0X of CDP which is high for
middle-income countries. The MOR accounted for 58.4Z of expenditureos the
university hospital for 9.12. and the private sector for 32.5S. External
loans and grants to the health sector are appromimately 16X of total
expenditure. The proportion of government investment and recurrent
expenditures allocated to the MOH has gradually declined from 82 in 1981 to
8X in 1985 (Annex I. Table 3.01). More than 902 of public sector health
expenditures sre funded from general government revenue. Although there are
no earmarked tazes for health, nor a health trust fund to which employees
and employers could contribute, a small amount of revenue (US$3 - 4 million)
is generated through user fees which comprise 7 - 82 of the MOR budget. MOH
expects to double the revenues generated by user fees by instituting
measures desgined to increase the collection rate and revising t!'e fee
schedule periodically to keep pace with inflation (para. 3.23).
1.29      Current Expenditures. The MOH budget covers expenditures for
hospitals, clinics, primary health care. family planning. and other
preventive care. MOB current expenditures amounted to US$51.7 million.
about $20 per capita in 1985. down from US$ 74.9 million or $35 per capita
in 1981, a decline of almost 452 in only five years. A relatively low share
(552) of the MOM budget is used for staff remuneration and relatively high
sbares for drugs and supplies (172), travel and subsistence, utilities and
mantenance (3X each). The proportion of MH'a recurrent budget allocated
to secondary and tertiary care amounts to about 682 of the budget, with 18%
spent on primary care and 162 on central administration. Only 1.62 was
spent on maintenance in 1983/84, and 1.72 on trainlng. During this period
of declining resources, MOR at first attempted to keep all facilities
operating at tha expense of maintenance of the physical infrastructure.
Lmited attention was given to -improvements in operational efficiency and
the quality of services. The result was a gradual deterioration in the
physical condition of clinics, hospitals, vehicles and equipment and a



-9-
tendency for patients to seek care at the hospitals where the decline in the
condition of facilities and quality of care was less marked. In 1985, MOM
bega  a program of "rationalization" of facilities, converting small
hospitals with low occupancy rates to outpatient facilities. Many positions
throughout the system were declared "redundant" and abolished, which
significantly reduced the oize of the payroll. The sector investment
program has been revised to reflect MOR efforts to improve the overall
efficiency and productivity of existing facilities through renovation and
minor expansion. Administrative and managerial reforms which emphasixe
increasing efficiency in the delivery of services (para. 3.14) and improving
cost recovery (pars. 3.22 - 3.24) have been initiated.
1.30     Sector Investments.  The GOJ made large investments in hospitals
during the 190s and in health centers during the 1960s. The overwhelming
majority of Investments in health infrastructure have involved the public
sector. The budget for capital investments has declined substantially
during the past five years. from US$ 8.9 million in 1981/82 to US$ 2.8
million in 1984/85. MOB sbare of the GWJ capital budget bas declined
slightly, from 71 to 61 (Annex II, 3.01). Since 1975, MOR has reduced the
size of new investments and focused on the priority areas of family planning
(maternity ward extension at Victoria Jubilee Hospital). emergency care
(Kinsston Public Hospital). and primary health care (64 health centers in
Cornwall County). The share of capital expenditures allocated to primary
health care increased from 301 in 1982 to 52X in 1985 (Annex II, Table
3.02).
1.31    The following projects, valued at US$32 million. are equivalent to
more than 901 of the Ministry's proposed investments for the 1985-88 period.
They are coasistent with sector objectives to improve resource utilization
and performance and are modest in size in terms of the overall planned
public sector investment program. (Annex II, Table 3.03)
(i) The proposed IBRD-assisted Population and Health Project, with
UNFPA and other cofinancing, would: (a) renovate clinics to expand
family planning services; (b) support management improvements in the
epidemiology, referral, information, planning and administration
systems; and (c) support ezpanded efforts in population policy
development and commercial retail sales of contraceptives.
(ii) The ongoing USAID-assisted Population Policy Support (US$4
million) and the Health Management Improvement (HMIP) (US$7 million)
projects will increase contraceptive supplies, improve MDH
communications and transportation, child health referral, training.
supplies, maintenance, planning and evaluation mechanisms.
(iii) Supplier credits (US$5 million) would be used for vehicles.
equipment, maintenance and referral services.
(iv)   GOJ funds (US$3 million) would be used for minor hospital
upgrading and rehabilitation.

1.32      Policies.  In 1974. the GOJ recognized the importance of improving
the nutrit1i;_ status of the population and established a Nutrition
Advisory Council which was to develop a national nutrition policy. The
policy developed included the following goals: (i) elimination of serious
protein and calorie malnutrition and anemia among children under five years
of age, and pregnant and lactating women; (ii) promotion of breast-feeding;
and (iii) increase of the local production of food to maintain adequate
nutrition levels for all segments of the population.
1.33       To meet the goals of the nutrition policy, the Government
encouraged: (i) local production and distribution of weaning food for
malnourished infants and supplementary food for pregnant and lactating
mother"; (ii) effective nutrition education and communication programs to
encourage breast-feeding, continued use of supplementary food and better
weaning practices: and (iii) strengthening of the ongoing school lunch
programs.
1.34      Programs. The Government is presently addressing nutritional
needs of the population through a program of nutrition surveillance and
rehabilitation, community surveys of children 0-3 years of age and the
preparation of a manual for nutrition and diabetes surveillance. After
screening and identifying high risk groups, a nutrition education and
rehabilitation program will follow. The nutrition education programs
initiated with the support of the second Bank Population Project are
continuing with the support of the USAID funded HMIP project. Selected
nutrition education messages are directed primarily at women who are
pregnant. anemic or have children under five years of age. The HNIP project
is also supporting the design and evaluation of a revised feeding program
which will increase individual rations and target them to two and three year
old children. USAID is providing the food through the Title II program, and
is developing an experimental reader with nutrition education messages for
4th and 5th graders. The H1IP. through its provision of resources for the
nutrition program has helped to alleviate the difficult economic situation
which had led to delays in the publication of some educational materials,
staff cuts, and generally lower levels of activity than hoped for when the
national nutrition policy waS developed.
D. Key Sector Issues
1.35      Jamaica has made substantial progress in developing its health
care system. in improving health and nutrition status, and in reducing
fertility. However, significant problems remain, the major ones being the
expansion of population protrams to achieve further reductions in fertility.
the future finjane4ng of health services, and increased efficiency in the
delivery of healt Ean  family planning services.
1.36      Expansion of Poiulation Programs.  The Jamaican Government has
formulated an explicit and well-focused population policy which has not been



-11-
fully translated into effective programs. The policy goals which include
population not to exceed 3 million by the year 2000. can only be attained if
the contraceptive prevalence rate increases significantly, from the current
402 to about 702. The ezpansion of family planning services must be
supported by population information and education programs if it is to
succeed, and these are only partially developed. The Govenment spends only
1I of the MWH budget on PP programs despite the high priority the program is
given in policy statements. The widespread awareness of family planning as
a concept must be matched by widespread understanding of human reproduction
and the relative risks and benefits associated with the various
contraceptive methods. Teenagers in particular represent a high risk group
whose needs are not yet being met by either the public or private sector.
1.37      Financing of Health Services.  Issues include the public/private
sector mis of serviceso the use of cost recovery mechanisms to reduce the
government's financial burden for health care. and the development of cost
control measures in the provision of services, particularly at the secondary
and tertiary care levels. The GOJ provides free bealth care for the
majority of the population almost without regard for their ability to pay
for services. The Government cannot afford to continue to offer free health
services to everyone without a serious deterioration in both the quality and
quantity of services provided. In fact. a large amount of primary care is
already being sought and provided in the private sector (para. 1.26). A
nominal charge is made for both outpatient and inpatient care at MOH
hospitals, but fees are not often collected and as a result, the revenues
generated cover only 12 of the MOH budget. The Government's designation of
some preventive services as free services and others including most curative
care as fee-for-service would allow the Government to move toward the
development of a cost recovery system which would contribute to the
maintenance of a reasonably high quality health care system. Government
encouragement of further expansion of prepayment or health insurance
mechanisms to pay for care provided in the private sector would reduce the
burden on the public sector. The Government is reviewing cost recovery
issues and discussing the possibility of a publicly supported health
inourance system, but has not yet defined a benefits package or determined
how care would be provided to the indigent.
1.38      Efficiency in the Delivery of Health and Fasmly Planning
Services. Inefficiencies include the inadequate planning and monitoring of
services, inefficient information and epidemiological surveillance systems,
personnel policies, planning and administration which do not respond to the
needs of the system, and inadequate supervision and coordination of
programs. The Government places high priority on the reduction of
fertility, which is to be accomplished by providing family planning services
to a larger number of men and women of reproductive age. In 1985. targets
were established for the first time, for the 1986 program. The infotmation
system is in the process of institutional strengthening and does not yet
provide timely feedback on health services, therefore it is difficult to
monitor progress or productivity in family plamning or other programs.

II. THE BAN'IS ROLE
A. Previous Bank Involvement
2.01      The proposed project would be the third in the population, health
and nutrition sectors. The first two projects concentrated on the expansion
of the physical infrastructure to support the provision of maternal and
child health, nutrition. and family planning services. In 1970, a loan for
US$2.0 million was approved for the expansion of postpartum family planning
services in support of the Government's single purpose family planning
program. The loan was closed and fully disbursed in 1977. three years later
than expected. In 1976, a second loan for US$6.8 million was approved to
provide integrated family planning, maternal child bealth and nutrition
education services on a pilot basis in Cornwall County. The project
expanded postpartum services to 10 hospitals and financed the construction
of 58 new health centers which were to be used to implemnt the 1974
government strategy to integrate family planning. nutrition. and primary
care services. An important software component of the second project was
the use of Community Health Aides (CHAs) for outreach work which combined
family planning counseling and nutrition education. That loan was closed
two years later than espected in 1983 when US$6.0 million had been
disbursed. Both of these projects were managed by a Project Director in the
Ministry of Health with civil works and other procurement managed by the
National Development Agency. The second project bad both a Project Director
and a Project Coordinator for Cornwall County (the Senior Medical Officer)
because of the intensive involvement of the County in the project.
2.02      The main problems encouniered in these projects included the high
turnover of project management staff becausoe of political changes. a
government-wide hiring freeze and budgetary constraints imposed because of
severe economic problems, and a resultant failure to implement all of the
software elements of the projects in a timely manner. The principal lesono
learned in the first project was that women preferred integrated services
rather than single purpose family planning clinics. This issue was
addressed in the second project but because of the general economic
problem, the Government was unable to employ enough nurse/midwives and CHAU
to meet project targets. An important outcome of the second project was the
successful institution and operation of integrated family planning,
nutrition, and primary health care services in the health centers financed
by the project. Some of the areas which were identified as weak.
e.g. training and supervision of family planning services, vehicle
management and maintenance, program manageamet, collection and analysis of
statistics, would be addressed under the proposed third project.
B. Bank Strategy and Rationale for Future Involvement
2.03      The Bank strategy reflects the policies and goals of the Jamaican
Government as described in paragraphs 1.16-17, 1.23, and 1.32-33. The
strategy incorporates the recommondations of the Bait's 1985 Economic Report
which indicates a need for the government to reduce recurrent expenditures.



-13-
improve public sector investment and decision making, and control the growth
of the civil service through careful planning. The Bank-supported Teobnical
Loan (2507-JI) proposes to assist MDH as part of the Govrnmeat' s broad-
based Administrative Reform Program (para. 1.26).
2.04      Prior to identification of the third project, the Bank's review of
the PHN sector investment program resulted in the following informal
agreements with GOJ which are reflected in the officially approved MOB.
investment program for 1985-88; there would be: (i) no expansion of bospital
capacitys (ii) selective expansion of smbulatory care services linked to the
rehabilitation of some facilities and consolidation of others which are
underutilized in an effort to redirect patients awsy from the more costly
hospital outpatient services; (iii) re-equipping of outpatient.facilities;
and (iv) no increase in operating costs. Bank support for nutrition
activities was not sought by the Government because the ongoing programs are
receiving donor support from PARO and USAID through the Nesith Manement
Improvement Project (HMIP) and the Title II food aid program.
2.05      The proposed project would be the third Bank-sssisted PHN project
in Jamaica. The project would expand and improve family planniag services
and strengthen the institutional capability of the Government to plan.
manage, monitor and evaluate health and population programs. The project
supported activities could make isportant contributions to fertility
reduction and Improve the health status of the population. The increse in
contraceptive prevalence is expected to ensure the achievement of the
Government's demographic goals (see Annex 1. Table 2.04). Banl support for
the expansion of ambulatory care facilities is important becaue it is
expected to lead to an improvement in beelth resources utilisation.
increased efforts at cost recovery and cost control in response to the
Government austerity program, and expansion of family planning services with
minimal impact on recurrent costs. Furthermore, no other external donor
agencies are prepared to assist the Government with a comprehensive project
that would renovate the health infrastructure and contribute to the
Government efforts to improve sector management and increase efficiency of
service delivery.
C. Other Donors
2.06      Several other donors are supporting GOJ efforts to reduce
fertility and improve health status. USAID is funding a US$9 million Rea?.th
Management Improvement Project whiech is scheduled to end in March 30. 1988.
The project has included minor renovations of some clinics. a study of
health care costs and the financing of health services, and a study of
hospital management issues. USAID also supports population planning
research, collection of demographic data. sex education, foamly plannin
comodities, primarily contraceptives. teen and maternal services through
the NEPB. the Jamaica Family Planning Association (JPPA), and the YMCA.
1NIPA supports a family life education progrsm in the schools in
collaboration with USAID. a depo-provera program, fellowships, study tours,
seminars and workshops and is cofinancing the proposed Population and Realth



-14-
project. The JFPA receivea support from The International Planned
Parenthood Federation (IPPF) through NP for youth programs, sterilisation
training and sertvices, and community-based distribution of contraceptives.
The Netberlands has supported the construction of a Type V center in an
expanding community near Kingston. UNDP has provided UN volunteer doctors to
work in rural health centers, and PAHO provides regular support through
technical assistance and fellowships.
III. THR PROJECT
A. Projoct Concept and Objectives
3.01      The principal objectives of the proposed project are to assist the
Government to: (i) achieve the objectives of the National Population Policy
(1983) namely, fertility reduction and the integration of population
concerns in the public and private sector development programs; and (ii)
develop a more cost-effective bealth services delivery system in line with
its Health Policy (1984).
3.02      In order to achieve these objectives, the project would ssaist the
Government to: (i) strengthen the institutional capability of the National
amily Planning Board (NFPB). the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) and
Min.stry of Health (NOR) to plan and implement expanded population/family
planning programs in public and private sectors; and (ii) improve NMO's
capability to plan and operate a more efficient health services delivery
system, and provide specific support for the analysis and adoption of
measures to improve the financing of health care.
B. Project Tar8ets
3.03      The project would support the Government's efforts to meet the
following specific targets: (i) increase from around 35Z to 702 the nuiiber
of primary health care facilities which offer a full range of family
planning services; (ii) increase from 272 to 55X the number of family
planning users who receive services from the MOR; (iii) increase
contraceptive sales through the Contraceptive Social Marketing program by
202 annually; (iv) improve access to family planning services through
evening clinics at 402 of all Type III health centers; and (v) incress.
access to permanent methods of contraception by offering more services on an
outpatient basis.
3.04      The Government has established specific targets to improve
efficiency in health care as outlined in the national health policy.
including targets for the implementation of new mechanisms for the financing
of health care. Targets include: (i) implementation of a data systems
network in 10 regional hospitals to provide financial and performance
indicators to the central MOH and hospital administrators; (ii) doubling
ambulatory care in the comprehensive health center in Montego Bay and
reducing the number of outpatients at the Cornwall County General Hospital
in Nontego Bay by about a third; (iii) standardixing referral procedures in



-15-
all PHC facilitieo and all hoopital facilities; (iv) doubling KOH revenues
from hospital fees within one year of changes in the system; and (v) the
design and implementation of a new health insurance system.
C. Project Beneficiaries
3.05      The total beneficiaries of the project would include about 400.000
women of reproductive age (150.000 women 15 - 19 years of age and 240,000
women 20 - 29 years); and about 760,000 men of all ages. Also, about 53% of
the population in the catcbment area are expected to use the comprehensive
health center in Montego Bay.
D. Summary of Project Composition
3.06      The project would consist of three parts. and would be implemented
over a seven year period between 1987 and 1994. Part A would strengthen
population and family planning programs through technical assistance and
program support for: population information in the Population Unit of the
Planning Institute of Jamaica; family planning service delivery in the
Ministry of Health; and information, education and communication (IEc) and
social marketing of contraceptives (CSM) at the National Family Planning
Board. Part B would consist of support for MOH efforts to improve the
delivery of an integrated package of services in outpatient facilities,
strengthen the referral system, and support the adoption of health financing
reforms. Part C would consist of innovative sub-projects for design and
testing of schemes for effective and easy acceptance of health and family
planning programs.
Part A:  Population and Family Planning Programs
(Base Cost: USS6.3 million)
The project would support the Government's efforts to strengthen the
demand for family planning programs and the delivery of services in public
and private sectors as follows:
I. Strengthening the Demand for Family Planning Services. This would be
effected by:
(a)  Population Information.  Expanding the work of the Population Unit
of the PIOJ to aisseminate information about population policy issues and
goals; educate key ministerial personnel on demography and social and
economic planing; and monitor and evaluate population information. To
achieve this, the project would finance the following:
(i) consultant services for 5 man months for population planning and
social. economic and demographic studies and analyses;

management systems, institute a referral system. improve cost recovery and
health financing and support innovative activities as foUlwcs
(a)  Strengthening Health Nanagement Syst_em. Strengthening the health
management systems through improvements in the planning and evaluation.
ppidemiology. health information and general administration and services
units. This program will be,coordinated with efforts in this area by PAHO,
USAID. and the Bank asoisted Administrative Reform program (pars. 2.02). In
support. the project would finances
(i)  104 man months conseultant services in planning and evaluation,
epidemiology, health information, general administration and
services;

Mi) 12 mon months of consultant services in referral system design;
(1i) training of approzimately 385 staff in management and use of the
new reforral system;



-18-
(iMO) furniture, equipment, and 9 vehicles to support the new referral
.aystem, construction, furniture and equipment for one Type V center and
related training and health services adminstration in Montego Bay; and
(iv) incremental operating costs for equipment maintenance, vehicle
operation and maintenance, local travel, and salaries of 4 staff.
(c)  Lmzrovin  Cost Recove  tad Health Financing Systems.  Improving cost
recovery and health financing systems by identitying and implementing
measures which would improve the quality and quantity of services provided,
establish fees which are commensurate with the actual cost of services and
take into account ability to pay, ensure efficient fee collection and
control costs. The project would finance:
(i) 22 man months of consultant services to undertake policy and
program studies to identify more effective cost recovery and healtb
insurance mechanisms.
Part C: Innovative Sub Projects
(Base Cost:  US$260.5O)        -
I.   Innovative Activities.  Support innovative activities wbich would
provide more in-depth examination of health and family planning programs for
key target groups such as teenagers and males, preventive health services
and health maintenance organizations (HMO). Project support would comprise:
Ci) reserving approximately 2Z of project funds (US$250,000) for
costs associated with the implementation of selected innovative
activities.
3. Detailed Project Description
Part A: Population and Family Planning Programs
(Base Cost: US6.3 million)
3.07      There are four project components; two focus on demand creation
for family planning services by strengthening information, education and
communication programs, and two strengthen the supply of family planning
services by improving delivery in the public and private sectors.
Strengthening the Demand for Family Planning Services
(Base Cost: US$3.3 million)
3.08      Population Information.  This component provides technical
assistance and training for the recently established Population Unit of the
Population, Health and Manpower Division of the Planning Institute of
Jamaica (PIOJ). The unit's work would expand to include: (i) the
dissemination of information about population policy, issues and goals;
(ii) education of high level officials and staff of key ministries on the
role of demography in social and economic planning; and (iii) monitoring and



-19-
evaluation of population information disseminated by various agencies. The
project would support five full-time consultants for a total of 5 man-
months to assist the Population Unit in the development of population
research on subjects such as the socio-economic determinants of fertility.
economic-demographic interactions of population growth and employment.
mating patterns of the adolescent Jamaican male, determinants of infant
mortality, analysis of internal migration trends and assessment of
emigration and loss of skills. The project would also provide for the
training of the Population Unit staff in computer techniques, and 15
manmonths of fellowships for training in demography, population information
and management of computerized library systems. It would also finance
special equipment, one vehicle. materials. consumable supplies. incremental
salaries for four staff, and operating costs for the Population Unit.
3.09      Information, Education and Communications (IEC). The work of the
INC unit would focus on increasing the demand for family planning services
and would include a mass media campaign, the production and dissemination of
educational materials for family planning programs targseted to teenagers and
other high risk groups, and t4e addition to NFPB staff of four regional IZ&C
program coordinator/supervisors. Some 1,300 individuals recruited largely
from youth organisations and industrial concerns with 100 or more employees
will be trained as volunteer family planning sotivators and, where
applicable. as promoters for the contraceptive social masketing program
(CSH - see para. 3.12) in training workshops organized by the NFPB. The
project would support seven full-time consultants for a total of 57
uanmonthe to assist NFPB to strengthening INC capability, finance the
construction and equipping of additional space in the NEPB building for the
extended INC program. five vehicles for field and supervision activities.
production of audio-visual material, consumable supplies, furniture and
equipment. some incremental operating costs, and incremental salaries for
six staff. During negotiations. the Government gave assurances that
training staff would be hired by NFPB by June 30. 1988 (pars. 7.01 (i)); and
that a strategy for IE&C would be prepared by NIPB and submitted to the Bank
for review by June 30, 1988 [para. 7.01 (Wi).
Strengthenlng the Delivery of Family Planning Services
(lase Cost: US$2.9 million)
3.10      Family Planning Service Delivery Program. The project will
support 140H efforts to improve the family plauring service delivery programs
In support of the Government effort to increase contraceptive prevalence
from 40% in 1983 to around 70% by 1991. Each 40 facility should have full
management and operational capability to serve as family planning service
delivery point (SDP) to respond to demand. 'This will involve: (i) the
repair. renovation, and minor expansion of 29 MOH facilities; (ii) the
extension of family planning clinic hours into the evening in urban areas;
(Mil) the development, testing and implementation of a system to identify
and follow up on drop-outs using community health aides (CUs) for home
visits; (iv) an increase in family planning clinic sessions so that services
will be provided daily; (v) training of nursing and medical personnel to



-20-
enable them to offer a full range of family planning methods; (vi) the
establishment and/or renovation of five health facilities which offer tubal
ligations on an out-patient basis; (vii) implementation of a newly developed
supply system and inventory of all contraceptive supplies of the MOB; and
(viii) improvements of existing supervision through a strengthening of the
monitoring and evaluation systems at the parish level, in-service training,
better coordinated transportation schedules and an effective management
information system, to ensure that family planning programs are being
operated according to agreed upon MOH and NFPB norms, that national and
parish level service delivery targets established by parish staff are being
met, and that information on performance is fed back to the parishes on a
timely basis.
3.11      Under the direction of NFPB. the project would provide funds for
25 manmonths of fellowships for the inservice training by MON clinical
trainers of around 500 nurses and physicians in the clinical management of
family planning services. About 50 will be trained in outpatient tubal
ligation and vasectomy techniques. Around 2,000 individuals will receive I
- 2 days of inservice training in education and counseling skills, male
responsibility and male motivation, and family planning motivation for
ancillary staff. Training will be ongoing throughout the project (see
training schedule, Annex VI). The project would also finance 24 manamotha
of consultant services to assist MOH in the development end utilisation of
family planning management information, furniture and equipment for 280
primary health care centers including the 29 scheduled for renovation, and
incremental operating costs for family planning services. During
negotiations, Government gave assurances that the MOE and NFPB would develop
annual training plans which would be submitted to the Bsuk for review by
July 31 of the first year of the project and January 31 of each project year
thereafter [pars. 7.01 (iii)].
3.12      Contraceptive Social Marketing (CSM). This program. administered
by NFPB. makes contraceptive supplies widely available at low prices using a
combination of mass media promotion and widespread distribution through
private sector comercial retail outlets. Support for this activity would
include improvement of the market research capabilities of the NYPB and the
marketing information system, distribution, and promotional activities.
Some of these efforts would accompany the introduction of new contraceptive
products provided by MOE. UNFPA and USAID including a low dose oral
contraceptive which is particularly appropriate for teenagers. The
objective of the NPPB is to increase sales of all contraceptives by 201 per
year during the life of the project. The project would provide funds for 5
manmothes of fellowships. a training progrsm for some 700 wholesalers.
retailers. pharmacists and physicians (para. 3.09); RAP (knowledge.
attitudes and practices) studies and research to be done by CSM staff on the
total audience reached by the various promotional efforts and their impact
on sales and services; materials production, some furniture and equipment.
and incremental salaries for four staff. During negotiations, Government
gave assurances that the NEPB would prepare a marketing strategy and plans
for the development and testing of messages and discuss with the Bank by



-21-
July 31 of the first project year and January 31 for each project year
thereafter [pars. 7.01 (iv)].
Part B: Health Sector Improvement
-   (BsMe Cost VU82.79 milion)
3.13      Jamaica's deteriorating economic situation in recent years has
forced the Government to make every effort to establish firm control of all
public sector expenditures. The increasing fiscal constraints have drawn
attention to the rising costs and managerial weaknesses in the public health
sector. The problems identified include inefficient management systems. an
unstructured referral system, a poorly conceived fee collection system with
an extremely low collection rate, and little or no progress in developing a
more comprehensive health financing scheme which would relieve the
Government of a greater share of the fiscal responsibility for health care.
The National Health Policy (1984) has been reviewed with these problems in
mind and sector objectives have been modified to address these issues.
Strengthening Health Management Systems
3.14      A PAHW management review of selected MOB head office units in
January. 1985 identified four units which needed strengthening: planning and
evaluation; information; epidemiology; and general administration and
services. The NOR endorsed the findings of the PAHO management audit and
incorporated the recommendations for improvement in the project proposal
prepared for Bank.appraisal. The program will be closely coordinated with
ongoing assistance from PAHO, USAID and the Government's Administrative
Reform Program which is also supported by the Bank. The four units would be
provided with a combination of 104 manmonths of consultant assistance, 108
mamionthe of fellowships. 1 vehicle each for Epidemiology and Health
Information Units, and equipment appropriate to the needs of the units.
3.15      In the Planning end Evaluation Unit, the project would provide one
full-tine consultant for 24 manmonths to assist the Ministry Planning Task
Force in the preparation of a five year plan. advise on means to increase
the use of information generated by the health system for lone-range
planning purposes and management of on-going programs, reorient the Unit
work toward investment-oriented planning and identification of projects
suitable for government and external financing, and increase coordination of
the Unit work with PIOJ to ensure consisteny with national goals and
priorities. The project would also provide 36 manmonthe of fellowships.
3.16      The work of the Epidemiology Unit is expected to focus. with the
assistance of a consultant, on improved planning for the tational
immunisation progra; intensified epidemiological surveillance efforts.
particularly with respect to malaria, dengue fever and major causes of
morbidity and mortality such as road accidents. cancer, and beart disease;
improved management of the quarantine services; and upgraded skills for unit
staff through training programs in epidemiological methods. The project



-22-
would support one full-time consultant for 12 manmonths and 40 matmonths of
fellowships, and finance one vehicle and special equipment.
3.17      The Health Information Unit is expected to follow up on work begun
under the AID-supported Health Management Improvement Project (HMIP) which
will terminate early in 1988. It will include short courses for new MOH
staff in computer technology, fellowships in biostatistics. demography and
computer programming, and, if feasible. a reduction in the number of staff
and reorientation of their responsibilities in line with their newly
acquired skills. In addition. the project would support the training of
computer operators in 10 hospitals to improve data systems management and
monitor costs and revenues in order to identify cost savings and other
efficiency measures and to feed into the MOH management information system.
The project would support four full-time consultants for a total of 44
amnatha and 33 manmontha of fellowships.
3.18      The General Administration and Services Unit will be one of the
major beneficiaries of the Government's Administrative Reform Program (ARP).
(para 2.02) which will assist the Ministry with a general restructuring of
its financial and human resources management functions. The Bank Health
Project would include support for a Management Advisor (24 manmonths) who
follow up on work completed under the HMIP project and would assist with the
design and implemetation of the organizational changes recomended by the
hRP. In cooperation with the Health Information Unit, the General
Administration and Services Unit would formulate procedures for a MOH
management information system, carry out budget and program studies to
provide the basis for performance-based budgeting and administrative
restructuring. design and implement property and equipment control systems
(life cycle management). and security systems for hospitals and clinics.
During negotiations, Government gave assurances that the MOB would hire the
health planner. epidemiologist, health information specialist, and
management advisor not later than March 31, 1988, and that selection and
contracting of these consultants would proceed under terms and conditions
stisfactory to the Bank (para. 7.01 (v)].
Restructuring the Referral System
3.19      The MOH refers to "Linkages" as the supporting elements which are
used to unify the various levels of the health and family planning service
delivery system. They include the routine and emergency referral of
patients from one level of service to another; the physical transfer of
patients; the utilization of the comprehensive health center as the point
for referrals up from the primary health care centers to the secondary and
tertiary care levels; and the transfer of information to facilitate follow-
up treatment at outpatient facilities after hospitalization. The project
would build on the efforts to develop the referral system which were
initiated in Cornwall County as an innovative activity during the last year
of the Bank project JPPII. At the completion of that project. the design of
the referral system was prepared only for emergency referrals. This project
would support the design of the system for routine referrals.



-23-
3.20      The project would support one full-time consultant for a total of
12 manmontha to assist in the development of a standardized referral system
for the entire island, finance workshops and training of some 385 staff in
various aspects of the linkages systems. in the use of the radio
communications system to transait routine information for supervision.
supply mnsgement, and patient referral, and to support emergency medical
services when necessary. It would also finance the construction and
equipment of a comprehensive Type V health center (Annex VII) at a site in
Montego Bay which has already been acquired. The Type V will provide the
primary health care services which are offered in a Type III center. and in
addition, will offer specialized outpatient clinics and tubal ligations on
an outpatient basis as well as relieving the Cornwall Regional Hospital of a
significant proportlon of its outpatient load. It will function as a
training center for medical interns from WI. and include space for patient
counseling. other :raining and administration. The comprehensive Type V
health center would replace a Type III (primary care) center which operated
in a rented building in Montego Bay. The staff from the specialized medical
clinics now offered at the Cornwall Regional Hospital and from the Type III
center which closed will work at the Type V center, therefore, incremental
recurrent costs will be minimal. The MOB has submitted to the Bank
contingency plans for delivery of services diverted from the closed Type III
center (to Cornwall Regional Hospital and a Type IT center) pending
construction of the Type V Center. The project would also finance speci
equipment, furniture, materials. 9 vehicles, incremental operating costs,
and four incremental staff. During negotiations. Governmeat Save assurances
that terms of reference for the management consultant would be prepared and
submitted to the Bank for review by January 31, 1988 (para. 7.01 (vi)] and
that the plan for the new referral system would be completed by October 31,
1988 [para. 7.01 (vii)] and the Government will thereafter implement the
plan's actions on wbich it and the Bank agree.
Tmproving Cost Recovery and Health Financinc Systes
3.21      The Jamaican economy has entered an extremely critical stage of
slow growth. high inflation, and high unemployment which has forced
Government to reduce expenditures for bealth and other social services. The
major financial and economic issues in the health sector include the rising
cost of bealth care, the implications for Government of continuing to
finance almost 100Z of the cost of services. and the limited returns in the
form of copayments by users of the public health system. Recognition of
these problems has stimulated an exai4nation of the role of public and
private sectors and the nature and extent of personal contributions for
health services by a committee of government and business leaders appointed
by the Prime Minister (the Ogle Co"umittee). USAID, Project Hope and PARD
have contributed to this effort by supporting a series of studies of the
current situation with regard to the cost and financing of health services.
The project would support further work by the MNO on the identlfication of
alternative cost control and cost recovery measures which would permit
improvements in the quality and quantity of services provided without
placing additional strain on the government budget.



-24-
3.22     Government has been vety receptive to policy discwuoions with the
Bank of refotms in the financing and administration of health services and.
in response to project-related discussions of health sector reform, has
continued its efforts to increase the efficiency of the system beyond the
measures described in para. 1.29. By January 1986. Government had prepared
a plan of action for Improving the collection rate of MOH bospitals with a
goal of doubling the fees coUleted within the first year after the changes
in the system are made. The MOB has been collecting about US$4 million per
year. 7-8X of recurrent costs. The revised fees, instituted in February.
1986, are expected to cover 15 - 16% of recurrent costs. In the medium
term, MOM hopes to collect close to 20% of recurrent costs through direct
user fees. During the period March 1. 1986 through February 28. 1987. MOR
will reduce the number of people ezempted from fees and institute a means
test of eligibility for free oervices based on the food aid program's green
stamp-green card. MOB also intends to charge a per tiem fee in wards and
revise the fee sebodule further by January. 1987, based on "perentage of
full cost" using the results of the cost study to be initiated by December.
1986. Private ward fees will be set to cover the full cost of services when
the coats are determined. Rospital fees will be indexed to keep pace with
inflation. In addition, Government has recently approved an executive order
to allow 50% of fees collected by public hospitals and clinics to remain
with the collecting unit as a further incentive to increase the efficiency
of their collection efforts.
3.23      The project would provide support for full time consultants for a
t'stal of 22 samonthe to undertake policy and program studies for the MOB in
tsae implementation of an effective fee collection system that will include a
valid means test; indexation of the hospital fee schedule to keep pace with
inflation; and the use of per diem rates rather than flat rates for public
wards. In addition, the studies would provide guidance for legislative
action to institute additional reforms which would be sensitive to the
current fiscal problems of the country and to institutional issues. The
specific administrative and financial issues via a vis healtb insurance
which will be examined include its relationship to the existing taz
structure, procedures for providing care for minimum wage earners and
indigents. division of the cost burden between employers and employees.
development of a formula for the division of charges between prepayment and
co-payment fees, and forecast of net revenues compared to projected total
public health expenditures. Institutional iosues which will be addressed
include the comparison of the costs and benefits of establishing a
government bealth insurance corporation versus the use of private insurers;
assessment of the administrative requirements for a basic health care
voucber system and the enhancement of vouchers for use with private
insurers: and definition of the pre-operational tasks essential to the
successful implementation of national health insurance. Another study would
analyze the costs and benefits of the privatization of certain facilities
and/or services. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that
these policy and program studies with tenms of reference satisfactory to the
Bank would be undertaken by consultants whose qualifications and experience
are satisfactory to the lank, will be completed by the Government not later



-25-
than June 30, 1989, that the Goverument will furnish the Bank with the
findings and recomendations of the studies, and that the Goverment will
thereafter implement recomendations of the studies on which it and the Bank
agree Epara. 7.01 (viii)].
3.24      Other activities agreed upon are: (i) internal MOH study of career
development, financial or other incentives to keep doctors and nurses in the
public system; and (ii) a Trelawney parish HM0 type insurance and service
provision pilot program involving a pre-payment risk-sharing scheme with a
public-private sector mix. The Trelawney pilot program, which is now in the
design stage, would be separate from the insurance evaluation study. In
addition.,the Ministry will complete its facility rationalization program
during 1986. This important cost-saving measure involves conversion of
small. low occupancy hospitals to outpatient clinics. Other studies to
determine the exact cost of health services and to summarize the pros and
cons of different options for health insurance (para. 3.22) are to be
initiated in late 1986 and 1987. A schedule with beginning and completion
dates and current status for all studies and actions described in
para. 3.22 - 3.24 was prepared and submitted to the Bank for review.
Part C: Innovative Sub-Prolects
(Base Cost: USS260,500)
3.25       Experience in other countries has demonstrated the desirability
of asking funds available for the support of innovative sub-project
activities. The activities may involve a more in-depth examination of an
appraised project activity or they may develop as a result of experience
gained in project implementation. In Jamaica. the potential for innovative
sub-projects appears to be greatest in the areas of service delivery, and .n
special population/family planning programs for teenagers. working women.
and programs directed to men. In health financing, experimentation with
commity supported health services or a health maintenance organization are
among the possibilities. Other areas of interest to the MOB include
preventive dental health programs and special evaluation efforts for some of
the proposed health financing activities.
3.26      A small portion (around 22) of the total project cost would be
reserved for selected innovative sub-projects whicb would require Bank
approval of the specific objectives of the activity, description of the
activity, personnel, including individual teDms of reference, work plan
including expected completion date, and budget. The following criteria
would be used to evaluate the proposals: (i) relevence to appraiued program
activities; (ii) innovativeness; (iii) appropriateness of the loan as a
source for financing the relevant activity; (iv) feasibility of
administration and evaluation of the activity; and (v) zeplicability.
During negotiations. Government gave assurances that draft proposals for all
innovative activities to be supported by the project would be submitted to
the Bank for review at the end of the calendar year prior to the year in
which the activity is to be initiated (para. 7.01 (iW)].

Basis of Cost Estimates
4.02      The baseline cost estimated at appraisal for goods and services
are adjusted to March 1987 prices. The cost estimates for civil works are
based on current contracts for recent construction of saiilar nature in
Jamaica and on preliminary architectural drawings prepared for the project.
The cost estimates for equipment. furniture and vehicles are based on agreed
lists of items and on the c.i.f. prices of similar items procured in the
country through UNICEF or other sources. The estimated total cost of
overseas training is US$0.5 ailLion and tecbnical assistance is estimated
ground US$1.8 million including contingencies. The cost of local training
is based on recent experiences in Jamaica, . d the cost of overseas training
is based on the cost of fellowshLps awarded recently by multi-bilateral
agencies.



-28-
Contingency Allowances
4.03      The total project cost includes physical contingency allowances of
IO for civil works. architectural services, equipment, furniture. and
vehicles. and 52 for educational materials, supplies and techeical
assistance. Costs have been calculated to the extent possible in US dollars
or converted to US dollars using the exchange rate at the tiue of appraisal
which was US$1 = J$6.0. Price contingencies have been calculated on the
basis of the projected annual price increases shown in Table 4.03.
Aggregate price increases are estimated at 27% of baseline costs. Total
contingencies are estimated to be 322 of the baseline costs.
Table 4.03: Projected Annual Price Escalation

Foreign Exchange Component
4.04      The estimated foreign exchange component of the project in US$7.9
million equivalent or about 642 of total project costs. The breakdown of
the foreign exchange component by category of expenditure is as follows:
civil works, architect's fees and equipment maintenance 60X; furniture 702;
equipment, vehicles, fuel. foreign expert services and overseas training
1OO2; local training. studies, research & evaluation and utilities 30X;
educational materials and supplies 95%2 innovative activities 252. drugs and
contraceptives 902; and office supplies 202. Estimation of the above
foreign exchange component is based on the following assumptions that:
ti) all civil works and architectural services will be carried out by local
firms but the majority of construction material. will be Imported; (ii) all
equipment, vehicles and audio-visual materials are expected to be directly
imported; (iii) some materials used in furniture will be imported but most
of the furniture contracts are expected to be awarded to local suppliers.
B. Project Financing
4.05      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$12.4 million.
The proposed IBRD loan of US$10.0 million equivalent would finance 802 of
total project costs and would cover about 942 of foreign exchange costo and
582 of local costs, The GOJ would finance the equivalent of US$1.8 million
which represents about 152 of total project costs and 292 of local costs.
The UNFPA would cofinance on parallel basis the equivalent of US$0.6 million
which represents about 52 of total project costs. This UNPPA finncing
amount would involve local costs for trainiug activities (about US$500,000),
and 502 of total local costs of renovation of 29 health facilities. A
condition of effectiveness would be that a UPPA agreement on behalf of the



-29-
respective parties tbereto, would be authorized or ratified by 1ll necessary
governmental action [para. 7.03 (iii)]. The proposed project financing plan

C. Project Recurrent Costs
4.06      The incremental recurrent costs generated over the seven years of
project duration are estimated at US$2.0 million equivalent. Incremental
recurrent costs have been held to a minimum because of the current difficult
economic and financial situation in Jamaica. These costs consist of fuel.
vehicle operations and maintenance (15%), staff salaries (302). travel
allowance (152), tubal ligation and family planning night clinic progrsm
support (15%), equipment maintenance (102) and utilities, drugs, office
supplies and contraceptives (15S). Project recurrent costs increase from
US$0.09 million in the first year to US$0.4 million in the sixth year of the
project. At full operation in 1993. the project would add US$0.4 million
equivalent per year to the annual recurrent budget of the MHR. These
increases in the recurrent budget represent 1.02 of the MOH 1985 recurrent
budget and 0.082 of the GOJ 1985 recurrent budget.   The financing reforms



-30-
which have already been instituted (para. 3.22) are expected to generate
additional revenues for the MON amounting to 7 - 8S of recurrent costs.
Which will ore than compensate for the IX increase in recurrent costs
resulting from project related activities. In the future, hospital fees
will be indezed to keep pace with inflation (para. 3.22), which will provide
additional protection for the MOR recurrent budget.  Because of the relative
importance of the project in the total investment program of the MRW. annual
total recurrent and capital budgets will be transmitted to the Bank after
Government presentation and will be discussed on en informal basis with the
Bank as necesaxy and feasible.

4.08      Civil Worzk. The upgrading of facilities and new construction
under the project uwll cost U8$2.7 million equivalent including
contingencies and would be awarded according to local competitive bidding
procedures which are acceptable to the Bank and which would allow foreign
bidders to participate. While foreign firms may participate, it-is
anticipated that because of (i) the competitiveness of the local
construction industry; (ii) the dispersed and remote location of health
centers to be upgraded; (iii) an average renovation cost o only US$40,000;
and (iv) the relatively low cost of the NFPB building in Kingston
(US$350,000), all civil works contracts would most likely be awarded to
local firms.
4.09      Goods. The total cost of equipment, furniture, vehicles and
material and supplies is estimated at US$3.5 million equivalent including
contingencies, of which US$1.2 million equivalent is estimated to be
procured through ICB in accordance with May. 1985 Bank guidelines, US$0.6
million equivalent through LCB and US$1.7 million through UNICEB (at tbe
request of the Government) or by obtaining and comparing at least three
quotations. Equipment, furniture, vehicles and supplies which are not
purchased through UNICEP would be grouped, to the extent possible, in large
packages to permit bulk procurement. Contracts in excess of $50,000 will be
awarded on the basis of ICB. Contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of
$50,000 or less, but more than the equivalent of $20.000, up to an aggregate
mount equivalent to $500,000. may be awarded in accordance with competitive
bidding procedures locally advertised, satisfactory to the Bank. Goods
estimated to cost the equivalent of $20,000 or less, up to an aggregate
amount equivalent to $100,000. may be procured by obtaining and comparing
quotations furnished by at least three suppliers eligible under the Bank's
Guidelines.
4.10      Services.  The selection and appointment of local and foreign
consultant services would be in accordance with the Bank guidelines (May
1981). During negotiations. Government gave assurances that terms of
reference and qualifications of consultants finnsced under the project would
be submitted to the Bank for review [para. 7.01  x)l.
4.11      Preferences.  For the purpose of comparing foreign and local bids
under ICB, qualifying domestic manufacturers would ba allowed a margin of
preference equal to the existing rate of customs duties applicable to
competing imports or 15% of c.i.f price, whichever is lower.
4.12      Bank Review Requirements.  The Bank would review prior to contract
ward: (i) all draft tender documents and contracts for construction in
excess of US$200,000 equivalent (402 of total civil works cost); and
(ii) all draft tender documents and contracts for goods and services in
excess of US$100,000 equivalent (642 of total goods and services costs).
Other contracts would be subject to Bank review after contracts are awarded.

_==_
4.14      The disbursement. (Annez IV) are expected to be completed by June
30. 1994. about seven and half years after loan effectiveness.  The
estimated disbursement profile of seven and half years is based an the
previous two PHN projects in Jamaica and reflects the standard profile for
all projects in Jamaica. The project completion date is December 31. 1994
and the project closing date will be June 30. 1994.
4.15      All disbursements for contracts above US$20,000 equivalent
financed by the loan would be fully documented. Disbursements against
contracts of US$20.000 equivalent and below would be made on the basis of a
statement of expenditure. The documentation for disbursements asainst



-33-
statements of expenditures will be maintained in the project files of the
MOH for audit purposes and also to be reviewed during oupervision missions.
4.16      In order to ensure the timely implementation of the project, the
Government proposes to retroactively finance the following activities: (i)
professional and management fees; (i-) recruitment of population information
specialists; (iii) pilot program in health financing; and (iv) support for
the project management staff; (v) innovative sub-projects. Retroactive
financing up to a limit of US$350,000 for all expenditures eligible for Bank
financing which were incurred on or after October 1, 1985 will be accepted.
F. Special and Project Accounts
4.17      In order to facilitate timely withdrawal of the proceeds of the
loan, the borrower will open and maintain en account with the Central Bank
of Jamaica under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The special
account for Bank contributions would be in US$ and the project account for
Government of Jamaica counterpart funde would be in $ Jamaican. The Bank's
iuitial deposit to the Special Account would be US$500,000, equivalent to an
average of about four months disbursements, and the Jamaican counterpart
deposit in the project account would be about US$140,000 equivalent, based
an anticipated rates of disbursements (see Annex IV). The World Bank will
replenish the Special Accounts from time to time on the basis of standard
documentation for reimbursable expenditures and the Government of Jamaica
will replenish the project account. A condition of effectiveness would be
that Government would open and maintain a project account with the Central
Bank of Jamaica under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank and
deposit the initial deposit in such account [para. 7.02 (i)].
G. Accounts and Audits
4.18      The three implementing agencies in the project (NOR. NFPB, PIOJ)
will keep separate accounts for project expenditures in accordance with
internationally accepted accounting procedures. The Project Manager will
receive and consolidate these accounts. These accounts will be audited
annually by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, and copies of the
audited statemaents would be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of
the fiscal year. The auditor's report would include an opinion and
comments, as necessary on the Special and Project Accounts and on methods
employed in compiling the statements of expenditures, their accuracy. the
relevance of supporting documents, their eligibility for financing in terms
of the project's legal agreement and the standards of record-keeping and
internal controls related to the foregoing. During negotiations, assurances
were given that the Government would follow the Bank's Guidelines for
Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects dated March 1982 [para. 7.01
(xi)].

V. PROJECT J3mL      TION
A. Status of Project Preparation
5.01      The status of project preparation is well-advanced.  The Bank has
reviewed extensively with Government its programs for implementing the new
Population Policy and improving efficiency of its health services delivery
system as well as its plans for the introduction of measures to improve the
financing of health care. The Government has initiated reforms in the fee
collection system. begun preparation of legislation to allow facilities to
retain 5OX of fees collected, made further progress in the rationalization
of facilities, and completed the HMO study in Trelawney parish (para 3.22.
3.24). The Bank has approved lists of furniture, equipment, and vehicles to
be financed under the project, final designs for the NFPB facility extension
and preliminary drawings for the Type V center in Mosatego Bay and about 30
other health facilities which are to be upgraded under the project. The
Government bas provided satisfactory confirmation of the acquisition of the
Montego Bay site for the Type V comprehensive health center. The Bank and
Government bave agreed on the staffing of facilities and approved the
training program.
B.  Organization and Management
5.02      The MOH will be the main executing agency for the project.  Under
the overall guidance of the Minister of Health, the Permanent Secretary of
the MOH will have the responsibility to oversee project implementation for
the Government. (See Annex IX, Charts 2 and 3). The Principal Medical
O4ficer in charge of Primary Health Care within MOB has been named Project
Director and will bave the responsibility for project supervision. The
Project Director will coordinate project implementation by the three
executing agenciess NFPB, P1IO and NOR, and will be responsible for
implementing the MOB components including family planning service delivery.
strengthening health management systems, restructuring the referral system,
and imprgving cost recovery and health financing systems. The MOH Project
Director will also assume responsibility for procurement. disbursement, and
maintenance of project accounts. All requests for disbursements from NPPB,
PtOJ. and MOR will be channelled through the Project Director who will be
responsible for the disbursement of project proceeds to the implementing
agencies.
5.03      A Project Manager has been hired to assist the MOB Project
Director with the routine administration of the project and will have two
assistants, one for civil works and the other for other procurement. The
MBO Project Manager will be supported by other MOB staff as follows: an
Information Officer for data research; a Procurement Officer in the Supply
Management Office; an Accountant under the direction of the Finance
Division; and an Architect to supervise civil works. Detailed terms of
reference for all project management and other staff were reviewed and
approved at appraisal, and are in project files. The Ministry of Health has
appointed a qualified architectural firm to design, prepare construction



-35-
drawings and supervise construction of the civil works components under the
project.
5.04      NIPB and PIOJ will each appoint an officer responsible for the
administration of their component. The Project Administrator at PIOJ will
be respousible for implementation of the population information activities
of the PIOJ (para. 3.08). The Project Administrator at NEPB will assume
responsibility for implementation of the IE&C activities (para. 3.09).
training program (para. 3.11). and contraceptive social marketing program
(para. 3.12). During negotiations. Government gave assurances that
government would appoint and maintain the full complement of project staff
:.ncluding the Project Director. three Project Administrators (PIOJ. MOD,
NFPB),  assistants for civil works and other procurement during the entire
project implementation period [para. 7.01 (xii)]. A condition of
effectiveness would be that project staff including the Project Director.
Manager and Accountant would be in place by effectiveness and during the
entire project implementation period with terms of reference and
qualifications satisfactory to the Bank [para 7.02 (ii)].
5.05      A Review Committee will be formed to deal with policy level
decisions affecting project execution. This committee will be cbaired by
the Minister of Health and will consist of the Permanent Secretary, the
senior directors in the MOR. MOF. Project Director, the Director General of
P10J. the Chairman of NFPB. and Senior Director of PAMCO.
5.06      A Steering Committee will be formed to monitor the project and
address working level issues which affect project implementation. Its
membership will include the Project Manager, heads of project components
from the three executing agencies, representatives of the Ministry of Public
Service. Ministry of Finance, Projects Analysis and Monitoring Company
(PAMCO). The committee will be chaired by the Project Director. During
negotiations. assurances were given that the Government would officially
constitute the Review aud Steering Committees and establish a regular
meeting schedule for each comittee [para. 7.01 (xiii)].
5.07      Project ezecution is estimated to require seven years which is
consistent with the disbursement profile for Jamaica. A detailed
implementation schedule was reviewed by GOJ during negotiations. It
includes a timetable for the following: (i) dispatch by MOH of essential
documents to the Bank for review; (ii) arrangements for local funding; (iii)
execution of component activities; (iv) procurement; (v) preparation of
annual reports. evaluation reports. and the project completion report; and
(vi) the deployment of project incremental staff. A full description of
each component is found in the Project Implementation Volume.
C. Reporting
5.08      The implementing agencies will prepare annual work plans and
budgets for all project components by January 31 of each project year and
submit these to project management in the MOH to facilitate the preparation



-36-
of project budgets and otber reports. The project account for PIOJ and
NFiB components will be kept separately and sent to the MOB for review and
reconciliation within one month after the end of each quarter. Antual
reports on the status of project implementation will be prepared by the
implementing agencies and sent to the MOM Project Director within three
months after the end of the year for review and transmission to the Bank.
During negotiations. Government gave assurances that within three months
after the end of each fiscal year. the MOR would submit to the Bank for
review an annual report on the progress of project implementation and annual
budget and work plan for the coming year [para. 7.01 (Xiv)].
D. Project Monitoring and Evaluation
5.09      Project monitoring and evaluation would involve a periodic
examination by the agencies responsible for project implementation of
project inputs. processes and outputs.  Process monitoring would examine the
attainment of intermediate objectivest in population and fasmly planning.
PI  and MMPP will monitor the quantity and quality of population
information disseminated to key ministries and other organizations: NOR will
mesure the increase in the number of NMO health centers which provide a
full range of family planniag services, increase in the number of tubal
ligations performed on an outpatient basis, decreese in the waiting time
requiret for the procedure. and increased recruitment of new contraceptive
users. In the health sector. process indicators to be monitored by the MOH
would include evidence of a functioning referral system for routine and
emergency medicel services; implementation of health financing reforms such
as the institution of a revised fee schedule and increase in the rate of
collection; and introduction of cost accounting procedures and financial,
reporting. NOR investment and recurrent budgets will be monitored to
confirm the economic and finaneial viability of project activities. Key
indicators will be included in annual reports to the Bank and will be
reviewed during supervision missions.
5.10      MOR would conduct an evaluation of the entire project with the
participation of PIOJ and NWPB. It would include a review of all of the
population and family planning components and the health sector improvment
components. The evaluation would be in 1990 and will include assesment of
the contraceptive prevalence rate. The USAID had provided assistance for a
Contraceptive Prevalence Survey in 1983 wbich established base line for
contraceptive prevalence rates. The project would provide funds for the
evaluation including 8 man-months of technical assistance. During
negotiations, assurances were given that Government would carry out a mid-
term evaluation of the project in 1990 under terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank [para. 7.01 (xv)].



-37-
VI.  PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benefits         
6.01      The project benefits would include an increase in contraceptive
use, especially among adolescent females and women aged 20 to 24. and
improved efficiency of basic health care services. The project would
support the Government's efforts to increase the coverage and quality of
family planning services provided by the,public and private sectors. If the
Government meets its targets. as noted in paragrapbs 3.03 and 3.04. it would
increase the number of contraceptive users by about 502 for MOH facilities
and about 202 annually for the Contraceptive Social Marketing program.
Achieving these targets would have major health and economic benefits. As
noted in paragraphs 1.08 and 1.10. the high fertility rate of young women
has a deleterious effect on the health of mothers. infants and children.
High adolescent fertility leads to an increase in the school drop out rate.
less favorable economic prospects for the young mother. and dependence on
society for economic assistance and social support.
6.02      The project would belp to improve the cost-effectiveness of basic
health care by strengthening management. supervision, and referral
(including less hospital outpatient and more Type V ambulatory load) in the
public health system. It should lead to improvements in the management of
human resources and finances, planning. epidemiologicd surveillance. health
infoxmation. and general administration. The project-related efforts in
these fields would complement ongoing projects in planning and management
which are being assisted by the Administrative Reform Program (Bank
assisted), the Health Management Improvement Program (USAID) and a program
at the hospital level to develop financial and statistical data. as well as
performance indicators (PARO). The project would also help to develop new
sources of revenue for the financing of health services to supplement
government contributions.  It would facilitate improvement of the fee
collection system, and implementation of a health insurance program as
described in para. 3.22. These and other efforts at cost recovery outlined
in para. 3.22 - 3.24 should improve the financing of public health services
in Jamaica.
B. Risks
6.03      The basic risks associated with the family planning component of
the project are: failure to coordinate the training and the Is & C efforts
of PIOJ and NFPB with the service delivery activities of NOR; weaknesses in
MOR and WPB administrative capacity, especially in supervision and
monitoring; difficulties in changing the behavior of MOB personnel from
passive to active providers of family planning services; and, the
intransigence of the teenage fertility problem, which has a long history in
the Caribbean Region.
6.04      The project would address these risks in a number of ways. The
annual preparation of work plans and budgets will be supervised by MOR.



-38-
which will have responsibility for interagency coordination of all project
components. Consultant assistance in program planning and management.
fellowships and in-service training programs for staff are being provided to
strengthen the capacity of all three organizations to manage their programs.
The project would finance four regd.onal liaison offices to strengthen the
supervision and monitoring of field staff to facilitate their carrying out
the Family Planning/ZEC program as planned. The IEC program will be
targeted to high risk groups including teenagers. Training officers will
work jointly with NFPB and MOH to coordinate all training activities, oome
of which will directly address the issue of active versuo passive promotion
of family planning services. Intensification of the IEC program and better
designed family planning services delivery programs would generate better
teenage response. The project would also support the development of a
monitoring and evaluation system for all project activities which will
facilitate the identification of implementation delays and/or problems at an
early stage.
6.05      There are two main risks associated with the health sector
improvement component: first, the MOB may have difficulty in deploying the
required staff to community-level facilities; and second, Government's
budget allocations to the MOB could be curtailed by a further decline in
economic performance. The Government's recently introduced economic
austerity program with its accompanying elimination of some positions and
hiring freeze has led to a loss of personnel at all levels, and an increase
in the work load for staff who have remained. This has adversely affected
staff o,rale and productivity. People may continue to bypass the primary
health care system and go directly to hospitals for treatment, despite
improvements in facilities and services at the community level.
6.06      With regard to the first risk, the project would address the staff
deployment by supporting a rationalization program for MOB staff, ensuring
better taok orientation and redistribution of staff in accordance with
service demands in MOH facilities. The project would deal with the risk of
patients continuing to bypass the lower level facilities by improving the
quality of services at the community-level facilities and by supporting the
implementation of a more structured referral system. Higher fees for
outpatient services provided at tertiary care facilities have already proved
to be a disincentive to the use of hospitals for routine care.
6.07     With regard to the second risk, Bank financing of around 80X of the
total project costs and UNFPA financing 52. will keep the need for
government investment funds to a minimum. Project activities which are
designed to increase revenue generation for the health care system will lead
to an improved financial position for the MOH, whicb will in turn provide
some budgetary relief.

CONTRACEPTMVE PREVALENCE AND FERTILITY RE PRCJECTIONS
A comparison of the 1979 and 1983 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys in
Jamaica showed an increase in the overall prevalence of contraceptive use.
from 342 to 40S of women of reproductive age. and an increase from 722 to
772 in the proportion who were using the more effective contraceptive
methods (pills. UDs. injectibles, and surgical contraception). This upward
trend in contraceptive prevalence and in method effectiveness is expected to
continue with the introduction of a new low dose oral contraceptive through
the contraceptive social marketing program and the expansion of the surgical
contraception program to more MOH outpatient facilities. An annual increase
in the contraceptive prevalence rate of about 1.12 is required to meet the
demographic goals of the Jamaican Government. (See Table 2.04) The
additional resources of the expanded family planning program are expected to
enable the Government to achieve this rate of contraceptive prevalence and
the desired fertility rate by 2005.
TABLE 2.04

1990        3.0         0.90          0.48
1995        2.5         0.90          0.57
2005        2.1         0.90          0.65
Note: Jamaica's total fertility rate was 3.5 children per woman between
1980-85. According to IBRD projections, replacement level fertility will be
reacbed by the year 2005. The CPR must increase by an average of 1.12 per
year in order for the TFR to drop 1.4 points in 22 years. The increase of
more than 1% per year between the 1979 and 1984 surveys suggests that this
is feasible if the program continues to expand.
