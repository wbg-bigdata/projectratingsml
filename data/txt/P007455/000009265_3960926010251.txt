MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
JAMAICA
FOR A POPULATION AND HEALTH PROJECT
1.      The following report on a proposed loan to Jamaica, for the equivalent of
US$10.0 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of
17 years. including four years of grace, with interest at the standard variable
rate. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) would cofinance the
project by a grant of US$650,000 equivalent.
Background
2.      Population.  The population of Jamaica was estimated at 2.3 million in mid-
1985. up from 1.6 million in 1962. Although fertility has declined from 6.6
children per woman in 1960 to 3.5 in 1983. projections indicate that the population
may grow to 3.5 million by the year 2000 if there is no further reduction in
fertility. In 1983. the Jamaican government formulated an explicit national
population policy which includes as one of its objectives the reduction of
population growth so that the population does not exceed 3 million by the year 2000.
This could only be attained if the contraceptive prevalence rate increases from the
current 40% to about 70%.
3.      Health.  The health status of the Jamaican population is relatively good as
indicated by a life expectancy of 70 years. and a crude death rate of around 7 per
thousand population. However, infant mortality, at 27 per thousand live births. is
three time higher than in the industrialized countries, and moternal mortality is
five times higher, at 50 per 100.000 live births. The decline of the Jamaican
economy in recent years has led to a significant reduction in expenditures for
health services, from US$35 per capita in 1981 to US$20 per capita in 1985. In
1985, the Ministry of Health (MOH) established new sector objectives to improve the
efficiency of the system in order to maintain services of acceptable quality within
budget allocations through increased cost efficiency and cost recovery .
4.       Issues.  Although Jamaica has made substantial progress in developing its
health care system. improving health and nutrition status, and reducing fertility.
significant progress is needed in several areas if the Government is to meet its
health and population policy objectives. The most important are: (i) to expand
population programs in order to achieve further reductions in fertility; (ii) to
improve health services financing and cost recovery; and (iii) to increase
efficiency in the delivery of health and family planning services.
Past Bank Lending
5.      The Bank has made two loans for population totaling US$8.8 million.  The
first loan (No. 690 - JM, US$2.0 m.) was approved in 1970 to expand postpartum
family planning services. The loan was fully disbursed in 1977, three years later
than expected. The second loan (No. 1284 - JM, US$6.8 m.) was approved in 1976 to
provide integrated family planning. maternal/child health and nutrition education
services in Cornwall County. The loan was closed in 1983. two years later than
scheduled. Both projects had mixed results because of high turnover in the MOB

staff and budgetary constraints. An important achievement of the projects was the
successful institution and operation of integrated family planning, nutrition, and
health services. Although the MOH continues to suffer from a shortage of qualified
upper and mid-level managers, this problem will be addressed in the proposed project
through training and technical assistance.
Project Objectives
6.      The principal objectives of the project are to assist the Government to
achieve the objectives of the National Population Policy (1983) and the Health
Policy (1984). It would strengthen the institutional capabilities of the National
Family Planning Board (NFPB). the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ), and the
Ministry of Health (MOH) to plan and implement expanded population/family planning
programs. The project would also support MOH efforts to control costs and institute
new cost recovery and financing measures including increased private sector
participation which would permit improvements in health services without placing
additional strain on the Government budget.
Project Description
7.      The proposed project, to be carried out over seven years. would consist of
three parts. Part A would strengthen population and family planning programs and
would provide training and technical assistance to: (1) the PIOJ to improve the
collection and dissemination of information about population policy and the role of
demography in social and economic planning; (2) the NFPB to improve information and
education (IEC) messages about family planning and the commercial retail sales of
contraceptives; and (3) the MOH to improve planning, monitoring and evaluation of
family planning programs. In addition. civil works and equipment would be providea
to improve about 30 primary health care centers to enable them to offer a full range
of family planning services. Part B would improve the MOH's capability to plan.
finance, and operate the health services delivery system and would provide technical
assistance to design a new patient referral system and to study cost recovery and
financing measures. In addition, the project would provide civil works. equipment
and furniture for the construction of a new health center in Montego Bay. Part C
would finance subprojects to test innovative schemes related to the development of
improved health, population and family programs.
8.      The total cost vf the proposed project is estimated at US$12.4 million
equivalent. with a foreign exchange component of US$7.9 million (64Z). A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement, as well as the disbursement schedule are given in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Jamaica are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map of
project sites is attached. The staff appraisal report. No. 6162-JM, dated May 1,
1987, is being distributed separately.
9.      Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The principal focus of the Bank strategy in
Jamaica is to support the Government's economic adjustment program. The
implementation of sound strategies in the social sectors is an important and
integral part of this approach in view of their long term impact and the need to
mitigate the cost of adjustment on the lower income groups through more efficient



- 3 -
targeting of social programs. In this context, the project seeks to bring about
sector reforms and support the Government's long term demographic and health
objectives.
10.          Agreed Actions.  The MOB would: (a) prepare an annual work plan and
budget for the project each year and establish regular policy and program review
meetings; (b) hire a health planner, epidemiologist, health information specialist.
and management advisor not later than March 31. 1988; (c) complete the plan for a
new patient referral system by October 31. 1988. and complete the cost control and
financial studies not later than June 30, 1989; and (d) submit draft proposals for
innovative sub-projects to the Bank for review each year prior to implementation.
MOH and NFPB would prepare annual training plans, NFPB would hire training staff and
prepare a strategy for IEC by June 30. 1988. and prepare an annual contraceptive
marketing strategy. Government would transmit to the Bank on a regular basis the
annual budgets and the three year rolling investment and financing program of the
MOH. The appointment of key project staff would be a condition of effectiveness, as
would n.ae ratification of an agreement with UNFPA and the establishment of a Project
Account with an initial deposit of US$140,000 equivalent.
11.     Justification.  The proposed project would increase the coverage and improve
the quality of population and family planning programs to enable the Government to
meet its demographic goals. Analysis of historic trends in contraceptive prevalence
indicate that Jamaica should be able to meet these goals if prevalence continues to
increase at the current rate. Improved utilization of health sector resources,
better targeting of programs, sustained efforts at cost recovery and cost control.
and implementation of appropriate financing schemes would enable Government to
improve health services within budget constraints.
12.     Risks.  The risks associated with the family planning component include: (i)
ineffectiveness in reaching target groups; (ii) poor coordination between NFPB. MOH
and PIOJ; and (iii) failure to change the behavior of MOH personnel from passive to
active providers of family planning services. Risks associated with the health
components include (i) further budget reductions; and (ii) difficulty in deploying
the required staff to community-level facilities. These risks have been taken into
account in designing the project, which includes improved monitoring and
coordination systems, a large trainino' program for MOH personnel, increased
education and information programs, and flexible innovative subprojects to reach
specific groups. Cost control measures in the MOH should reduce the risk of
inadequate counterpart funds for the project. as well as the relatively large
portion of the project financed by foreign sources.
13.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
