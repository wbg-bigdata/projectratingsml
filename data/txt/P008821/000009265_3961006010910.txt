RUSSIAN FEDERATION
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJEC r
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
BORROWER:           Russian Federation.
BENEFICIARIES:      Ministry of Environment Protection and Natural Resources (MEPNR);
Ministry of Finance (MOF); Regional Governments in the Urals, Upper
Volga and North Caucasus; and private and state enterprises.
AMOUNT:             US$110 million equivalent.
TERMS:              17 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate.
ON-LENDING
TERMS:             The proceeds of the Bank loan (US$57.7 million) would be onlent to the sub-
borrowers under the National Pollution Abatement Facility (NPAF) and
Investment Project Preparation Advance (IPPA) facility in US dollars, with
an interest rate spread satisfactory to the Bank (initially 400 basis points) and
with maturities generally up to eight years, including up to three years of
grace. The sub-borrowers will bear the US dollar exchange risk.
PROJECT
OBJEcnvEs:         The Russian Federation has requested the World Bank to assist in establishing
an Environmental Framework Program (EFP) whose objectives are to (a)
incorporate environmental and natural resource management concerns directly
into the economic, social and political adjustment process at the federal and
regional levels of government, including the executive and legislative
branches; (b) strengthen and streamline institutional and organizational
structures for environmental and natural resource management; (c) improve
environmental and natural resource policy and strategy formulation and
implementation; (d) upgrade environmental and natural resource management
systems; (e) strengthen financial delivery mechanisms to address priority
environmental management investment needs through the setting up and initial
capitalization of the NPAF; and (f) facilitate the flow of donor and
multilateral funds and resources to the environmental protection sector. The
project would provide critical support to the EFP.
PROJECT
DESCREMON:         The project consists of the following five main components: (1) Institutional
and Policy Strengthening, including the following two subcomponents: (a)
Policy and Regulatory Support; and (b) Environmental Epidemiology; (2)
Water Quality and Water Resource Management; (3) Hazardous Waste
Management; (4) the NPAF for funding economically and financially viable
pollution abatement projects; and (5) the Center for Project Preparation and
Implementation under MEPNR.



Loan and Project Summary                                                             vi,
JUSTICATION
AND RISKS:          The specific benefits that are expected to accrue as a result of this project are
as follows:
(1) the establishment of national databases and standardized methodologies
and systems for the collection and verification of environmental health and
hazardous waste generation data for policymakers at the national and regional
levels;
(2) the upgrading and adoption of overall environmental action plans based
on environmental health priorities at the national level and in the Upper
Volga and Urals regions, and the first phase implementation of these plans to
test and demonstrate their application;
(3) the development and Phase I implementation and adoption of specific
action plans for water quality and resource management in the Upper Volga,
Urals and North Caucasus Regions, and sectoral environmental action and
Phase I implementation plans for: (a) iron and steel; (b) non-ferrous metals;
(c) oil refining and petrochemicals; (d) basic organic and inorganic chemicals;
and (e) agriculture with particular attention to intensive livestock operations;
(4) the formulation and adoption of improved regulatory systems and
enforcement mechanisms for water quality and water resource management
in the Upper Volga and North Caucasus regions; for hazardous waste
management in the Upper Volga region and for environmental assessment at
the national level;
(5) the dissemination of the experience and the results of project financed
ativities to other regions in the Russian Federation through a national
outreach program;
(6) the establishment and management of a national facility to fund private
sector investment in pollution abatement and improved resource utilization and
recovery. The effectiveness of this facility will be judged on the basis of the
amount of private loan and equity funds it is able to leverage for pollution
abatement, the extent of pollution reduction achieved through its investments
and its ability to address pollution priorities identified under items (2) and (3)
above;
(7) the improved organization, management and training of staff of
environmental regulatory agencies at the federal level and in the Upper
Volga, the Urals, and the North Caucasus regions; and
(8) facilitating donor participation in the environmental sector in Russia
through the establishment of a Center for Project Preparation and
Implementation and donor involvement in project workshops.
The main risks that the project may face include: (1) the fragmented decision
making process for environmental management at the federal and regional

levels; (2) the shortage of experienced and qualified Russian specialists in
environmental economics and law; (3) the poor environmental regulation
enforcement capability of the legal system in Russia; (4) conflicting mandates
and lack of cooperation between government agencies and even between
departments within the same agency; (5) possible delays in project
implementation due to a lack of familiarity with Bank procedures and the
requirements of project management in general; (6) difficulties in arranging
local cost financing for pollution abatement; and (7) potential adverse impacts
of high inflation on projects financed by the NPAF. The project will build
on initiatives already being introduced by the Government in order to address
these issues. Firstly, at the federal level, the project will be under the
direction of the recently formed Federal Commission on the Environment
(with MEPNR acting as the Secretariat of this Commission), which has been
set up to improve inter-agency cooperation and decision making for
environmental management. The regional project areas were selected on the
basis of already existing arrangements for promoting inter-agency cooperation
for environmental management and their government's strong commitments
to environmental quality improvement (usually because of strong local
community  pressures).   The project proposes an early  start to a
comprehensive training program to improve skills in environmental policy and
regulation, as well as in the technical areas of environmental epidemiology,
hazardous waste, water quality management and project management. The
use of twinning arrangements with foreign institutes will ensure practical
application in the development of these skills. Trained personnel will also be
delegated to work at regional, as well federal level to transfer their skills. In
the participating regions, cooperative arrangements for pollution abatement at
major polluting enterprises will be negotiated with appropriate incentive
arrangements for compliance with agreed permit schedules.
To minimize risks of project implementation delays, framework agreements
have been reached between federal and regional agencies that will be
responsible for project implementation laying out in detail the responsibilities
and arrangements for component implementation. These agreements will be
formalized as binding resolutions by the respective parties after loan
effectiveness. The early setting up and staffing of the Center for Project
Preparation and Implementation (CPPI) and recruitment of a Project
Management Advisory Firm to assist the CPPI with the setting up of
procurement, financial and information management systems has been
designated to reduce risks of implementation delays. The NPAF will be
equipped to assist borrowers to put together packages for project financing
including a full array of financing arrangements from local and foreign sources.
One of the criteria on which the NPAF operations will be judged will be its
ability to leverage other sources of financing. IPPAs would enable enterprises
to develop high quality projects to the stage where they meet the requirement
for NPAF project financing. The pollution abatement projects that will be
targeted by the NPAF have a number of inherent characteristics that will
protect them from the impacts of high inflation, namely: (i) recovery of
valuable resources from waste streams with zero or negative costs; and (ii) end
products that have a high economic value in world markets and are exportable.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A.    Introduction
1.1          In the past 70 years, the Russian Federation has inherited an enormously costly
environmental legacy from decades of inefficient economic development that basically failed to include
environmental factors in macroeconomic and sector development strategies and national investment
plans. For the Chernobyl disaster alone, the cost of environmental mismanagement has been estimated
at tens of billions of dollars. There are also ongoing costs across the economy from, for example,
natural resource loss and pollution, that are not stated explicitly in the national accounting process or
sector budgets but are obviously a significant percentage of GNP. The Russian Federation is not
unique in this respect, most industrializing countries followed a similar development path, although
in many cases, made more dramatic structural adjustments at an earlier stage of development.
1.2          In the past, many countries in transition from a centralized state economy to a more
market orientated system, adopted a policy of economic efficiency in its limited traditional sense of
ignoring many environmental issue, to pursue the adjustment process. Currently, however, many
reasons can be found for incorporating environmental and natural resource management concerns
directly into the economic adjustment process-as is being done in Russia and some other countries
of the FSU. The following arguments will illustrate the point.
1.3          First, as the country searches for new sources of growth and comparative advantage,
it may (as in the case of Russia) use natural resources such as forests, lands, oil, gas, minerals, water,
and vegetation much more intensively. It is plausible that natural resource-intensive exports would
be expanded and promoted to replace the old traditional exports. In such a case, decision-makers have
to cost existing natural resources used in trade at their full opportunity cost, to avoid giving a false
sense of comparative advantage in the short and medium term. If these resources are not adequately
costed at the macro level, use rates of those resources will be much higher, and serious misallocation
of resources, environmental degradation, or depletion may occur. In some cases, irreversible damages
may also occur in the country (for example, destruction of biodiversity resources and fragile
ecosystems).
1.4          An important general point regarding adjustments during such transition periods is that
any set of reforms implemented at the national level (such as privatization, industrial restructuring,
monetary and market liberalization) will have a great influence and impact on the allocation of
resources, on the environment and the use and management of natural resources ("natural capital" for
short). These policies are not at all neutral with regard to natural resources and the environment.
1.5          The second argument for including environmental concerns in macro-planning is that
the solution to many environmental quality and resource management problems rests on major
institutional and organizational changes (for example, regarding property rights, taxes and subsidies,
regulations, laws, and private sector participation). If the reform process does not take into account
these institutional realities at the beginning, some of the most important sources of national capital
depletion and degradation will be very difficult to correct at the end of the process. For example, if
property rights, user rights, or management rights over a significant amount of forests, for instance,

are given to an economic agent during the reform process, without appropriate environmental
assessment it will be almost impossible to reverse those rights after the reform process; or if they are
reversible, the reassignment will be at very high costs.
1.6          An increasing number of government decision-makers in the executive and legislative
branches at the federal, regional and local levels in the Russian Federation are searching for ways to
restructure and reform the economy to promote efficient and more sustainable economic growth-an
impossible goal without taking environmental quality and natural resource management factors into
consideration. Some important initial steps have been taken, but much more needs to be done at all
levels of legislative and executive government, or this initial momentum will be lost, along with the
enormous opportunities that currently exist for influencing the reform process. The EFP and the
Environmental Management Project are designed to help the Government of Russia to meet this urgent
need and to take advantage of these opportunities.
B.    Economic Context
1.7          In the centrally planned economy of the FSU the standard success criteria of a market
economy-efficiency and profitability-were often ignored and an industrial culture evolved where
waste and disregard for efficiency were normal when the end objective was "pure production".
Industries in the FSU consumed more than twice as much energy and raw materials to produce the
same amount of final product as in a typical market economy. Industrial development under the Soviet
system emphasized heavy industry with extensively developed and polluting iron and steel industries,
nonferrous metal smelters, large oil refineries and petrochemical complexes, etc. In the past 20 years
major investments have been made in the military/industrial complex, thereby greatly restraining
modernization of the industrial base of the country.
1.8          In 1991 there were 22,900 industrial enterprises in Russia accounting for over 30%
of total employment. However, since the mid-1980s, industry's share of both NMP and employment
has fallen from 48.6% to 42.2% and 32.4% to 30.9% respectively. Over the period, agriculture and
construction have expanded as a percentage of NMP from 14.1% to 19.9% and 10.5% to 12.7%
respectively. As in the other sectors of the economy, agriculture is inefficient in the use of agricultural
inputs, as well as experiencing high losses in the storage, transport and marketing of the final
products.
1.9          Russia is also a major producer and exporter of timber, producing 228 million cubic
meters (m3) per year. However, unsustainable natural resource policies have resulted in over-
exploitation of the forests in some regions. Logging has consequently had to move steadily eastward
into Siberia, which accounted for 34% of Russia's sawn timber production in 1989 compared with
25% in 1970.
1.10         Russia has the fourth largest fishery industry in the world (behind Japan, the United
States and China). However, habitat loss and pollution from industrial and urban development as well
as over-exploitation, have had a disastrous effect on inland fisheries. Prior to World War II, the catch
from inland water bodies exceeded that from the ocean shelf, but today the ratio is 10 to 1 in favor
of the ocean. Catches of fish have decreased in the Sea of Azov and the Caspian Sea by over 90%.
1.11         The FSU was the world's leading producer of all major fuels with large proven
deposits of oil, gas and coal. Oil and gas currently account for 45% of Russia's foreign exchange
earnings. This industry is also characterized by low efficiency and waste, as readily evidenced by



Background                                                                             3
extensive oil contamination of land and water resources in oil-producing regions of the Urals and
Western Siberia and the widespread flaring of associated gas. Russia is also the second largest
generator of hydro-electricity (after the United States), producing 224 billion kilowatt hours (kwh),
or 13% of the country's total electrical output.
1.12         The FSU was also a major producer of many types of minerals for example; gold,
chromium, iron, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel, tungsten, and asbestos. The Russian
Federation is particularly well endowed with these deposits (in the mineral-rich Ural mountains,
Siberia and the Russian Far East).
C.    Geographic Context
1.13         The Russian Federation covers 17,075,400 square kilometers (kin2), almost twice the
size of the United States and 70% of the territory of the FSU. Its population in 1991, 148.5 million,
was exceeded only by China, India, the United States, Indonesia and Brazil. Even though its
population density is low on average by world standards, it is characterized by wide regional
variations from as high as 52-77 per km2 in the economically well developed regions in Central and
European Russia, to less than 1 per km2 in parts of Siberia.
1.14         Extending halfway around the northern hemisphere and covering much of eastern and
northeastern Europe and all of northern Asia, the territory of Russia displays an enormous variety of
landforms and ecological systems. The major ecological/climatic lowland zones stretch east to west
across the country, and are made up of various tundra subzones in the extreme northern areas, mostly
above the Arctic Circle, that give way to a vast forest belt covering approximately two-thirds of the
entire country (see attached map, IRBD 25119). The forest zone may be further divided into two
subzones: taiga forests and mixed forests. The taiga is characterized by the preponderance of
coniferous forests of spruce, larch, fir and siberian stone pine. Deciduous species-birch, aspen and
alder-are of secondary importance. In the mixed forests, so called "broad-leaved" species (for
example, the oak) appear together with the conifers. Further south the land turns to open steppes, and
finally to hot drylands and semi-deserts. Massive mountain ranges such as the Ural, the Caucasus and
the mountain areas of Siberia (for example, the Altay, the Sayans, Lake Baikal and the Trans-Baikal
regions, and the mountains of Far Eastern Siberia) interrupt these lowland features.
1.15         Positioned in latitudes where precipitation mostly exceeds evaporation, Russia contains
many long rivers, lakes and wetlands. Rivers such as the Volga in European Russia and the Ob in
Western Siberia are among the world's longest. Lake Baikal is the second deepest freshwater lake in
the world and contains 20% of the world's total freshwater-more than all of the Great Lakes of North
America combined.
1.16          "Russia" derives not from "russkaya" (pertaining to the Russian nationality) but from
"rossiyskaya" (pertaining to the country of Russia), and this vast and diverse territory is in fact the
home of about 120 nationalities or ethnic groups of which 82% represent ethnic Russians. This
situation is reflected in the Republics' complex system of administration. There are 20 autonomous
republics within the Russian Federation, as well as five autonomous regions and 10 national districts.
The remainder of the Russian Federation is administratively divided into 6 territories (krais) and 49
regions (oblasts).
1.17         Throughout Soviet history, the size of cities grew  rapidly in response to
industrialization; in 1959, 48% of the population in the Soviet Union lived in cities and 52% in rural

areas, but by 1990 the figures were 66% and 34% respectively. In Russia where the population
increased by 10 million in the past two decades, the share of city inhabitants in the total rose from
69% in 1979 to 74% in 1991. However, majority of the population and the industrial activity is
concentrated on the territory west of the Ural mountains. On the other hand, the bulk of the nation's
natural resources are now located east of the Ural mountains.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
II.  THE ENVIRONMENT SECTOR
A.      Overview
2.1             The development of the system of environmental management in the FSU has been
characterized as fragmented and uncoordinated with more than ten government agencies having some
responsibility for environmental concerns. The long-standing problem has been that the implementing
ministries and overseeing government bodies have a built-in conflict of interest in being responsible
for both economic targets and environmental protection. Only in 1988 was a Union-Republican State
Environmental Protection Committee (Goskompriroda) formed with a mandate to strengthen direct
regulation and enforcement of environmental norms and standards and to coordinate the work of
ministries and committees responsible for environmental management and nature protection. Since that
time, several reorganization attempts to better integrate environmental management under the present
MEPNR have failed to achieve their objectives in full. This is mainly explained by the legacy of a
system of centralized management of the economy that emphasized production over efficiency,
concentrated pollution-intensive industries in enormous complexes, compartmentalized decision-
making, and treated natural resources as free goods.
2.2             The failure of the previous, centrally planned Soviet system  to efficiently and
effectively manage regional economic development and environmental issues was implicitly recognized
in the Russian Federal Treaty of March 14, 1992,1' that formally devolves much of the former powers
and resources of the central ministries and committees to regional and local level agencies. The trend
toward decentralization has major implications for solving environmental and natural resource
management problems. These changes, while creating much uncertainty and confusion, also present
unprecedented opportunities for providing strategically targeted support and assistance, based on sound
economic, social, environmental, and natural resource management principles. The Environmental
Framework Program (EFP) and the Environmental Management Project (EMP) have been designed
to support these changes.
B.     Enviromental and Natural Resource Management Issues
1.     Pollution and Wastes
Air Pollution
2.3             The industry and energy sectors are the major sources of atmospheric pollutant
emissions in the Russia Federation, although road transport is becoming an increasingly important
source of low-level emissions in urban areas. Forty-three cities- in Russia have been identified under
1/ Treaty of the Delinitation of the Objects of Jurisdiction and Powers between the Federal Bodies of the State Authority of the Russian
Federation and the Bodies of Authority of the Republics within the Russian Federation.

the Russian Government Resolution No. 93, of March 16, 1990, as a priority for urgent measures to
reduce the current high levels of air pollution. Stationary sources in Russia generated some 28.2
million metric ton (mmt) of noxious air pollutants in 1992 (31.8 mint in 1991), including 8.2 mrnt of
SO2 (9.2 mit in 1991), 6.8 mint of CO (7.6 mint in 1991), 6.6 mmt of hydrocarbons and 2.8 mint
of NOV. These figures greatly underestimate the true volume of emissions, because of chronic under-
reporting by enterprises and the biased methods used to make these estimates. Moreover; there is
considerable regional variation in the distribution of these emissions according to the type of pollutant
(see Figure 2.1). The main sources of industrial air pollution in Russia are the nonferrous metal
smelters, iron and steel mills, coal-burning power plants, cement plants, oil refineries, and
petrochemical and chemical plants.

2.4           Because of the inefficient combustion of fuels, the large system loss of natural gas,
and the extensive flaring of associated gas (8.2 bcm, in 1991), the FSU was the second largest
generator of greenhouse gases in the world in 1989, discharging some 4,480 mmt of CO2 equivalent,
compared with 5,610 mmt of CO2 equivalent in United States.
2.5           The extent of the acid rain problem in Russia has not been well documented, although
Russian enterprises alone discharge more S02 than Belgium, France, Holland, the United Kingdom,
and West Germany, combined. Moreover, these emissions are concentrated mainly in the Urals and
in east Siberia (as shown in Figure 2.1), and potentially threaten sensitive lake ecosystems in the
northern areas, as well as forests, wildlife habitat and agriculture crops.
Water Pollution
2.6          In 1992, the total volume of water withdrawn in the Russia Federation was
approximately 111 cubic kilometers (km3), with a consumption loss of 9 km3. Industry (including
power stations) used about 48.5 krn3; irrigation, 15.4 kin3; urban households, 14.7 km3; rural
population and livestock needs, 13 kin3; and other users, about 7.4 km3.
2.7           About 70% of the urban population in the Russian Federation is supplied with water
from surface sources. Groundwater is primarily used in the rural regions (mostly shallow wells).
Although the amount of water withdrawn in the whole country does not exceed 3-4% of the mean
annual runoff, in a number of watersheds (the Don, Kuban, Terek, Ural, Iset, Miass, and others),
about 50% of available water is withdrawn, causing rapid deterioration of local aquatic ecosystems.
2.8           Effluent discharges into surface water bodies in the Russian Federation totalled about
70.6 km3 in 1992, including 27.1 km3 of polluted wastewater, 42 km3 of untreated cooling water, and
about 3 km3 of standard treated water. The bulk of polluted wastewater was discharged by ferrous and
nonferrous metals, chemical, petrochemical, petroleum, coal, and pulp and paper industries, as well
as by municipalities insufficiently treating their wastewater (containing as a rule large volumes of
untreated industrial wastewater). The non-point discharges of agricultural origin (contaminated
primarily by toxic chemicals and pesticides), were in the order of 8 km3.
2.9          In 1992, the most widespread toxic pollutants discharged to surface water, were
petroleum products (about 39.4 thousand tons discharged in 1992 to surface water), phenols (0.2
thousand tons), copper compounds (0.9 thousand tons), zinc (1.6 thousand tons); and in some regions,
ammonia nitrogen (187.0 thousand tons), phosphorous (59.8 thousand tons), and iron (57.2 thousand
tons). Large amounts of biogenic substances are washed down to surface water bodies from farm
fields. The current level of domestic wastewater treatment is such that even in the case of biological
treatment, the effluent contains sufficient amounts of nitrates, phosphates and phosphorus to cause
extensive eutrophication of water bodies.
2.10          The quality of surface water resources is monitored in the Russian Federation at about
2700 sites, covering 1159 rivers, 80 lakes and 67 storage reservoirs, through a national monitoring
network established about 50 years ago. Its main purpose was to detect the trends and long-term
changes in surface water quality, but there were too few observation sites and observations were too
infrequent for water quality management purposes.
2.11          The Maximum Allowable Concentrations (MACs) were violated many times in 1991
for most of the polluting substances that were analyzed. For petroleum products they have been
violated in 40-45 % of the samples taken. Similar numbers for MAC violations for other pollutants

are: 30-35% for organic substances; 45-60% for phenols; 25-40% for ammonium nitrogen; 70-75%
for copper compounds; and 30-35% for zinc compounds.
2.12         Bacteriological contamination of rivers and lakes below large urban centers is
common. On the basis of public health indices, surface water bodies are divided into two categories:
Category I is water fit for drinking, and Category II is recreational water. In 1991, for Russia as a
whole, about 25% of the samples from both Category I and Category II water sources did not meet
public health standards on the bacteriological indices. Sources of infectious disease were found in
1.2% and 5% of samples from Category I and II waters respectively.
2.13         The situation is particularly alarming in a number of the country's oblasts and cities.
For example, about 60% of samples from Category I water sources do not meet bacteriological
standards in Kostroma Oblast. In Bryansk Oblast, this figure is 91%; in Rostov Oblast, 51%; in
Kemerovo Oblast, 52 %; in Khabarovsk Krai, 52 %; and in Omsk, 51 %. Sources of infectious diseases
were found in approximately 40% of samples from Vladimir Oblast and 13% of samples from
Novosibirsk Oblast. Category II water bodies do not meet bacteriological standards in 60-80 % of the
samples taken.
2.14         Regarding groundwater, in the vicinity of major industrial enterprises and agricultural
regions, approximately 500 sites with polluted groundwater have been identified, including 70
operating water intakes. The most severe groundwater pollution problems occur in the Moscow Oblast,
in the area of lignite coal mines in Tula Oblast, at oilfields in Tatarstan, Perm Oblast and
Bashkortostan, and in the vicinity of major industrial cities such Volgograd, Magnitogorsk and
Kemerevo. Groundwater is contaminated mostly by sulfates, chlorides, nitrogen compounds, petroleum
products, phenols and heavy metals. In the majority of polluted groundwater aquifers, MACs are
exceeded 10 times for at least 1 of the polluting substances.
Hazardous Waste
2.15         The first nationwide inventory of industrial hazardous waste in the Russian Federation
was published in 1990, based on data collected in 1989 by the State Committee for Statistics. At that
time, there were 80 ministries and committees at national and regional levels that had information on
hazardous waste, but the information was not generally shared or made available to the public,
especially information from the ministries concerned with the military-industrial complex.
2.16         The 1990 inventory was carried out using a questionnaire form that was filled out and
collected from almost all enterprises in the country. The reporting form included information on the
volume of waste generated (self reported) by the enterprise, the amount used, the amount stored, the
amount transferred to other units, and the amount buried, based on four standard classes of toxicity
used to characterize hazardous waste in the FSU. The concerned authorities recognize that the results
are not sufficiently reliable because of under-reporting. Even so, the results suggest an alarming
situation. Summary data on production of toxic wastes in the Russian Federation, from the 1990 waste
inventory, are presented in Table 2.1.
2.17         Since 1990, work has continued within MEPNR and associated institutes on refinement
and implementation of the basic national system for hazardous waste management including
improvement of the waste classification system. However, it is apparent that progress on this is not
proceeding expeditiously due to lack of resources. More specifically, it has not been developed to the
point of implementation at the level of detail required to support an effective regulatory management



The Environment Sector                                                                   9
system. This is viewed as a prerequisite for compliance with the Basel Convention on Transboundary
Movement of Hazardous Waste which is considered a bench mark in assessing progress toward
meeting international standards in the control of hazardous waste. The Russian Federation has signed
but not yet ratified this convention, largely because these basic standards are still to be put in place.
2.18          Continuing attempts are being made to maintain and update the original 1990
inventory.  Under MEPNR direction, regional and municipal environmental committees have
established regular reporting requirements for major enterprises in the last several years and the
availability of this information to and within the federal level on a consistent basis is sporadic and
incomplete. Within MEPNR, resources available to handle, interpret and transfer the data received
remain limited. Plans to consolidate locally supplied data into a national inventory on a regular basis
have not been implemented, although a state program on "Waste" has been prepared, this program
has progressed slowly. Similarly, several industry specific organizations, either Ministries or
Committees for particular industrial sectors or associated Institutes, have data on wastes in their
particular industrial sectors. However, a general lack of coordination and consolidation of this
information has been noted and conflicts respecting valuations and access of these data are apparent.
2.19          It has been observed that current industrial waste management practices depend
predominantly on direct land disposal, utilizing large scale lagoons and landfills, or direct discharge
of liquid effluent to surface water. Only limited discrimination among these industrial wastes is
utilized in employing these disposal practices.  These practices are resulting in significant
environmental impact and in many cases have exhausted available land. A large scale development
program will be required to provide more effective and environmentally sound facilities, something
that should involve a nationally based plan, utilizing accurate data. In the absence of a consolidated
picture of industrial waste generation, tabulated on a consistent basis at the national level, it is difficult
for coordinated planning of actual waste management infrastructure to occur. As a result, initiatives
currently being proposed to MEPNR from the local and regional levels are largely being made on an
ad hoc basis.
2.20          The amount of toxic waste generated annually by the organic chemical industry is
890,000 tons, of which less than 10 % is reportedly destroyed and 35 % is recycled or re-used (mainly
petroleum waste).
2.21          The Russian Federation has one of the world's largest metallurgical industries.
Consequently, metal-containing waste is a major portion of the total 75 million tons of solid industrial
waste produced every year. Approximately 27 million tons is metal-containing waste including Cu,
Cd, Co, As, Ni, Pb, Mg, and Cr. Most are Ni-containing wastes, accounting for 25 million tons.
However, only a part of this waste is considered to be hazardous. Approximately 450,000 tons per
year of dust-containing fluorine and cathode residues are produced by the aluminum and fertilizer
industries.

2.22            The engineering and machine building industry in Russia is also a major sector.
Twenty major machine building complexes exist in Russia, and there are, in addition, about 3,500
individual enterprises. The electroplating industry, which is associated with the engineering and
machine building sector, is a major source of hazardous wastes in Russia, generating some 750,000
tons per year. Electroplating baths are often discharged directly to surface waters or to sewage
treatment plants without any treatment. This action results in a reduction in the treatment efficiency
of the biological treatment process of the sewage treatment plants. Metals, for the most part, end up
in the biosludge and consequently, the sludge cannot be used in agricultural applications. The sludge,
depending on where it is stored, can pose a long-term problem as a result of heavy metal leaching,
resulting in groundwater contamination. There are approximately 5,000 electroplating shops in Russia,
of which 1,000 are located in Moscow. Half of the electroplating plants have treatment facilities for
waste baths and rinsing water but only 25% of the total plants are using their treatment facilities.
2.23            Russia has committed to phase out PCBs, although plans to achieve this have not yet
been finalized. Residues of banned pesticides are also a growing problem, with approximately 30,000
tons of pesticides currently being stored awaiting destruction. Radiological contamination and nuclear
waste disposal are also problems to be addressed on a large scale.

2.    Natural Resource Management Issues
Forests
2.24         The forest products industries of Russia do not make a contribution to the national
economy commensurate with the size of the forest resource, nor do they, as a whole, contribute a
large share to the export base, except in select cases, such as log exports to Japan. Forest industries
make up about 5% of gross industrial output, and 7% of the value of exports from Russia. The
amount of industrial product derived from each tree is significantly lower in Russia than is the case
in Scandinavia and North America. Much of the wood is wasted in the production process, and a large
share of national harvest still goes for fuelwood (20-22% of the yearly cut). Improvements in the
industrial use of wood could be an important first step toward better conservation of Russian forests.
2.25         Shortcomings in forest products industries tend to have a negative impact on the
environment of Russia, in four ways:
*     Poor use of deciduous trees in industrial processes. In the pulp and paper industry,
for example, deciduous species make up only 9% of the raw material base, versus
30% in the United States and 58% in Japan. Improved management and consumption
of deciduous species under a sustained yield forestry system in the European regions
of Russia could reduce the need for shifting timber harvesting operations to Siberian
stands or over-cutting accessible coniferous forests.
*     Poor use of wood by-products. More than 50 million cubic meters of leftover wood
materials are produced yearly in Russia during industrial processes, but only half of
it is used to make composition boards or contribute to the wood chemicals sector.
Twenty percent of all wood harvested in Russia is used directly to make packaging
materials, such as paperboard, whereas much of the material needed could come from
the woodchip by-products of sawmilling and other processes.
*     Forest industries as direct sources of enviromnental damage. Deforestation has
contributed to soil erosion and water resources have suffered due to effluent
discharges from pulp and paper mills, with only 19% of the pulp and paper industry's
wastewater receiving effective treatment.
*     Low level of capital investment in forest industries. One approach to improving
both the environmental record and output performance of the forest sector is in
creating new and cleaner technologies. Such processes would make better use of trees,
allow selective cutting, enhance and expand replanting efforts, raise productivity in
industry, and reduce levels of environmental pollution. Unfortunately, such
technological shifts come at a high price, and investments levels in forest products as
a whole have not grown since the 1950s. In 1970, for example, forest industries were
allocated a 5.1% share of national basic investment in industry; in 1980 this share was
4.5%, and in 1986, 4.2%. In fact, forest products activities, especially logging and
sawmilling, are probably some of the most severely under-capitalized of any industry
in the country.
2.26         The Russian forest products industry thus faces the formidable three-fold task of
improving production efficiency to satisfy consumer demand, offering more wood products on world
markets to provide export income, and improving wood utilization practices that have already had

severe consequences for the environment. All this is to be accomplished in what has been treated as
a backwater part of a troubled economy.
Land
2.27            Land resources. Table 2.2 provides a breakdown of land categories in the FSU by
management or use and by natural zones. However, due to the generally northern location of the
country, much of that land resource is rather limited in terms of its possible uses and potential
habitability. Aridity and mountainous terrain are two other widespread constraints. Some of the largest
natural zones found in the FSU, such as the Arctic tundra and the Central Asian deserts, not only have
limited economic possibilities but also possess fragile and easily destroyed ecosystems. Even the
largest natural zone, the vast forest belt or taiga, has important limitations on the extent and nature
of its use, and has suffered from organizational and environmental mismanagement.

2.28            On the other hand, some of the most threatened ecosystems in the Soviet Union are
relatively small, and have already undergone a high degree of adverse transformation. Such
ecosystems include the narrow but very important vegetated corridors along rivers (particularly those
in arid areas), as well as the rivers themselves. They also include coastlines, both tidal and freshwater
wetlands, and isolated areas of rare or unique vegetation.



The Environment Sector                                                                  1 3
2.29          The long-standing problem has been that the implementing ministries and overseeing
governmental bodies have a built-in conflict of interest in being responsible for both economic targets,
environmental protection and resource use. The agricultural sector, for example, has pursued policies
that have sacrificed soil fertility to crop productivity. Over Russia as a whole, 13 million hectares of
land suffer from soil erosion; 12 million hectares have been lost to construction and roads, and 3
million hectares to irrigation systems; 10 million hectares have been flooded for reservoirs; and 2
million hectares have been damaged by open-pit mining. As has been previously noted, the economic
mandate has in general prevailed over conservation goals. As a result, many land use management
problems, such as erosion and reclamation, have had a rather slow pace of improvement.
2.30          Land protection. Unfortunately, many areas in Russia are highly vulnerable to soil
erosion. Much of its arable land is either on sloping terrain that is susceptible to water erosion or is
in semi-arid regions that are subject to recurring drought. These concerns are exacerbated by the
extensive occurrence of fine-grained, wind-deposited soils (called loess) over much of the fertile steppe
and forested steppe regions of the country. Past farming practices, going back into the nineteenth
century, were often inadequate to protect these highly erodible topsoils, and losses in the pre-Soviet
period were great. In the twentieth century, sub-optimal agricultural practices (for instance, plowing
marginal lands, soil salinization in arid areas, improper use of fertilizers, downslope plowing patterns,
and use of excessively heavy machinery) have also often been conducive to topsoil degradation and
accelerated erosion.
Inland fisheries
2.31          The causes of the decline in the fish harvest from lakes, rivers, and estuaries includes
such recurring themes as over-fishing, urban and industrial effluents (in numerous rivers), dams and
reservoirs (on the Volga and Ob), increased salinity (in the Sea of Azov), and diversion of water for
irrigation (the Don and other rivers). These factors, singly or in combination, have greatly diminished
fish stocks in a number of water bodies that historically were very productive.
2.32          The impact of direct discharge and leakage of industrial effluents and hazardous wastes
from land disposal sites near major rivers is becoming measurable in the freshwater fish population.
Bioaccumulation of metals and chemicals, as well as biological changes have been noted in the Upper
Volga region for example. At the same time fish remain a major food source in this region.
2.33          The FSU responded to these problems in a variety of ways, including the introduction
of new species, constructing new fish breeding facilities and spawning areas, creating a vast network
of small stock ponds, and occasionally instituting fishing moratoria where appropriate. In response to
the perceived seriousness of the problem, special resolutions on fisheries conservation and management
were passed in 1974 and 1981. Such actions have partly alleviated the problem, but the take of many
desirable species (most notably sturgeon) continue to be well below former levels, and the Ministry
of Fisheries acknowledged in 1984 that serious problems remain.
Biodiversity and Nature Protection
2.34          Overview. The 8 biogeographic zones of the Russian Federation encompass 54
ecological zones that contain unique and endemic species. In the FSU, there were 35,000 species of
higher plants, with 553 in the Russian "Red Book" of endangered species, of which 49% are endemic
and 23 % are at the limit of their ranges. There are approximately 130,000 species of fauna, with 463
species appearing in the Red Data Book, of which 70 are in the most critical category of "endangered"
(IUCN Category I).



14                                                            Environmental Management Project
2.35          Although much of Russia's biodiversity is outside of protected areas, the protected area
system is one of the most important, and until recently one of the best organized systems in the world.
It consists of (1) 79 Nature Reserves or Zapovedniki (strictly protected and used for research with 16
classified as UNESCO Biosphere reserves; 1.2% of Russian land area); (2) 22 National Parks or
Natsional'nyi Park (protected, although with tourism in specified zones); (3) 71 Special Purpose
Reserves or Zakazniks (established to safeguard certain flora and fauna, protected status is occasionally
seasonal; 3 % of land area); and (4) National Monuments. The 76 Zapovedniki comprise 45% of the
total of all global strict scientific reserves. The Russian scientists have an extremely distinguished
history of research in these reserves, 16 of which are part of the Biosphere program; and an enormous
amount of scientific data has been collected on natural areas. Advantage has also been taken of the
opportunity presented by changes in land tenure and administration during the transitional phase, and
additional protected sites have been established by the government.
2.36          Due to economic and social pressures, the nature protection system is under threat.
This threat is further compounded by the fragmented institutional system that is uniformly and
simultaneously beset by a lack of coordination, efficiency and funding. For instance, protected areas
are administered by a plethora of organizations: the majority (71) are managed directly by the small
Department of Nature Reserves (within the MEPNR), but seven are managed by other institutions.
National Parks are managed by one of the departments of the Forest Service Agency. Most of the
Zakazniks are controlled by the local governments, although 71 are under federal administration with
the local Committee of Environmental Protection responsible for the increasingly sporadic inspections.
2.37          Protected areas are now severely under-financed, with national inflation at 20-30%
per month. Current appropriations do not cover salaries for the 20,000 personnel, and essential
activities are being cancelled. Also, the increasing need for local communities to exploit protected area
resources has meant that 19 of the 76 Zapoovedniki are already in a critical state, with another 19
rapidly deteriorating. Furthermore, the difficulties of the transition period are encouraging
inappropriate resource use that should be corrected promptly.
2.38          Global importance of biodiversity in the Russian Federation. Approximately 10% of
the world's biodiversity is represented by the vast range of species (many of which are endemic) found
in Russia. Loss, depletion or even degradation to this natural resource treasure would have profound
biological and philosophical impact on all of life-as well as decreasing the tangible benefits accruing
from sustainable use of the resources. Additionally, the expanse of forests and tundra acts as a
significant carbon sink. Destruction of these areas, combined with the swift eradication of tropical
forests (the other arboreal sink) would have a profound effect on world climate change.
2.39          The Canadian Parks Service, at the request of the Bank, has recently identified the
protected areas system in Russia as being in immediate danger of disintegration. Given its global
importance to biodiversity conservation, an attempt must be made to save it. An area of particular
importance, and one under serious threat, is Lake Baikal. This area requires immediate assistance in
biodiversity protection; and because it is a microcosm of the country as a whole, can be used also as
a pilot project (see project description in Annex 2). Specifically, this area shows the need for sound
management of both in-situ and ex-situ efforts, and provides considerable opportunity for consensus
building in the consideration of available conservation options.

3.    Institutional and Legislative Framework for the Environment
Environmental Institutions
2.40         Prior to 1988, the FSU had no central administrative and management bodies involved
in environmental protection; and a number of ministries and departments performed different
management and monitoring functions in natural resources conservation and environmental protection,
including the USSR State Agro-industrial Committee, State Forestry Committee, USSR Ministry of
Water Management and Reclamation, USSR Ministry of Fishing Industry, USSR State Committee of
Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring, USSR Ministry of Public Health, USSR Ministry
of Geology, USSR State Mining Safety Inspectorate, and USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These
ministries and departments often operated as powerful monopolies, ignoring environmental concerns
and the interests of local populations, as the centrally set production targets served as the primary
incentives.
2.41          Organizational Structure of Environmental Quality Management in the Russian
Federation. On January 8, 1988, the Communist Party Central Committee and Soviet Government
adopted a resolution by which a central state management entity-Goskompriroda-was established
in order to modernize the conservation and regulation of natural resource use. In 1990,
Goskompriroda was transformed into the Ministry for Nature Use and Environmental Protection of
the USSR (USSR "Minpriroda"). Subordinate ministries or departments were established in the
Russian Federation and its autonomous republics and at the krais (provinces, districts), oblasts
(regions), and local levels. These commonly take the form of regional or municipal environmental
or ecological committees which in practice should undertake implementation of regulatory actions.
2.42         Despite USSR Minpriroda's status as a Ministry, implementation of its policies was
slow and inconsistent, and the Ministry and its territorial bodies met strong resistance from other
ministries previously responsible for environmental issues within their respective sectors. Many of the
ministries managed to hold on to their traditional powers with respect to environmental concerns, often
meaning that they were given little attention in relation to main line-ministry production functions.
2.43         One aspect of environmental policy-making particularly impeded by bureaucratic
division was information gathering and analysis. Research on the environment in the former Soviet
Union was conducted by over 1,000 institutions under the auspices of 70 different ministries and
agencies. The authors of the USSR 1989 National Report on Environment, prepared under
Goskompriroda coordination, described serious bureaucratic challenges they encountered in gathering
available information, not to mention assessing the information's reliability, because each agency had
its own methodology for collecting and analyzing data. This in itself represents a major barrier to
effective and coordinated environmental planning and policy making.
2.44         Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Russian
Federation. In Russia, the recently renamed Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural
Resources (MEPNR) is, in many ways, similar to that of the previous the USSR Minpriroda. MEPNR
is the central governmental organ responsible for environmental protection and natural resource
utilization in Russia, in conjunction with the executive authorities of the legal subjects of the Russian
Federation. Its functions include regulation of land utilization and conservation, and the use of surface
and ground water, air, vegetation, wildlife, and natural resources, including those of the territorial
waters, the continental shelf, and the exclusive economic zone.



16                                                         Environmental Management Project
2.45          Within the Russian Federation, the governments of the subjects of the Russian
Federation have received greater powers in formulating policy, including environmental policy. At
the same time, the earlier system of ministries and state committees charged with environmental
responsibilities essentially remains.  Due to rapid, ongoing changes in the Russian system of
government, the institutional framework for environmental protection is still evolving and devolving
to lower levels in the government structure.
2.46          The structure of the MEPNR is illustrated in Annex 1. Territorial bodies of the
MEPNR work with executive authorities and industries to achieve standards, conduct inspections and
assess fines. The territorial bodies of MEPNR are empowered to carry out inspections for local
environmental protection and elaboration of environmental programs in their areas, accounting and
assessing of natural resources, volumes of production, waste accumulation, and pollution. They are
also responsible for State Environmental Impact Assessment Review of projects and for issuing of
permits, making decisions on restriction, suspension and cessation of environmentally harmful
activities, settlement of disputes, protection of natural monuments and protected areas, ecological
training and education, and information dissemination.
2.47          The present environmental administration is going through a period of substantial
change. The overlapping of duties and fields of responsibility of different organizations is a common
feature, as is the constant shortage of resources. Efforts are underway within the Government and
MEPNR to define and resolve possible areas of overlap, conflict, or gaps. An important recent
initiative in this regard has been the formation of a Federal Commission on the Environment under
the Chairmanship of the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for Environment, Natural Resources and
Agricultural issues which is responsible for settling overall environmental policy and resolving
interagency conflicts. Increasing cooperation and coordination of environmental management activities
by regional governments is being achieved through the formation of Inter-Oblast Environmental
Councils.
Environmental Law and Policy
2.48          In formal terms, the conservation and rational use of natural resources were
constitutionally guaranteed in the FSU. Principal laws and codes, such as "On Air Protection" (1960),
"Land Code" (1970), "Code on Mineral Resources" (1976), "Water Code" (1972), and "Fundamentals
of the Russian Federation On Forestry" (1977) were adopted. In addition, there have been Communist
party and government resolutions that have covered general environmental protection and wildlife
utilization.
2.49          Protection of the environment in Russia was carried out by legislative, administrative
and economic means. The constitution of the country imposed an obligation on the state to ensure the
protection and rational use of the environment. From the legal point of view environmental protection
was declared one of the basic functions of the state.
2.50          During the Soviet era, the Russian system consisted of a number of separate laws that
addressed the following areas: (1) conservation and protection of "landscapes"; (2) protection of
natural and environmental resources; and (3) protection of the human environment against pollution
(this included protection of drinking water, urban air, and agricultural soils).
2.51          While environmental protection legislation and institutions were being developed
during the Soviet era, both at the central level and in the republics, environmental objectives in
general remained secondary to near-term industrial production objectives. The limited financial and



The Environment Sector                                                                17
other resources earmarked for environmental protection, the lack of enforcement of environmental
norms and regulations, and the use of censorship and other means to control public information on
the environment contributed to weak implementation of these policies. Generally, the central and the
Russian governments largely ignored the growing environmental problems and public environmental
concerns. However, there were some notable exceptions to the practice during the Soviet era,
particularly with protection of wildlife and forests, and efforts to ensure safe drinking water.
2.52          A shift in Soviet policy occurred in 1986 and 1988, when efforts were increased to
rationalize the use of natural resources and protect the environment. Incentives for decreasing material
and energy inputs per unit of output were introduced. While economic imperatives were the primary
driving force behind the new policy, the growing costs to the environment were also increasingly
being appreciated.
2.53          The USSR "Law on the State Enterprises" (passed in 1987) had special value in this
regard, by containing legal provisions for taking account of environmental impacts. This law contained
the first preventive measures aimed at curbing pollution and limiting excessive and wasteful extraction
and production methods in the former Soviet Union. Its Articles 17 and 20 specifically referred to
environmental aspects, such as payments for the use of natural resources, environmental protection
measures, and compensation for environmental damage (to be paid from the enterprises' own budgets).
Introduction of cleaner technologies became mandatory for certain types of production.
2.54          This law was founded on the premise that state enterprises should and could become
self-financing and profit-making entities, with a stake in their own profitability. However, it proved
difficult to implement the new policy, to some extent because the efforts to realize enterprise self-
financing faltered. The realization of plans envisaged by this and other laws during the Gorbachev
presidency, turned out to be unrealistic, and suggested that a deeper restructuring of the whole
economic, political, and social order should be done before any individual innovations of particular
production sectors.
2.55          The Russian Federation Law on Environmental Protection. Based on the Soviet-
inspired antecedent passed in 1961, this 1991 law sets out noble principles-for example, every citizen
has the right to a healthy and safe environment. To this end, the law establishes the areas of
responsibility of the various levels of government within the Russian Federation. The federal
government, for example, is tasked with establishing environmental standards and procedures for
setting fees for natural resources use. Governments at the republic level set fees and issue licenses for
natural resource use. Regional (krai and oblast) governments issue permits for pollution emissions.
Regional and local agencies are responsible for monitoring emissions; and republic- and regional-level
agents enforce compliance with federal standards. On this point, the law also stipulates a positive role
for individuals and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to assist with monitoring and enforcement
and guarantees their right to association, their right to information, and their right to seek legal redress
for environmental degradation.
2.56          The Russian law  mandates State Environmental Impact Assessment Review
("Gosudarstvennaya Ecologicheskaya Ekspertiza") for all development activities. The law sets out the
obligations of enterprises with regard to compliance with standards concerning waste management,
handling of hazardous materials, air and water emissions, noise pollution, land use and reclamation.
Of note, the law extends all regulations to include all military operations on Russian territory, ending
the Soviet tradition whereby the military could act independently of the law. In what signals a dramatic
departure from the past, the law mandates criminal liability for "environmental damage", as well as
"obligation for full compensation" for damages to the environment and also to public health. Finally,



18                                                          Environmental Management Project
the law also contains several novelties, such as mandating "environmental insurance" against natural
or manmade disasters and establishing the concept of a "zone of environmental disaster" where all but
essential economic activities must be halted in order to restore the environment.
2.57          Environmental Funds. The system of local, regional and federal Environmental
Funds, formed in June 1992, is critical to the funding of nature protection activities of the MEPNR
and the territorial and local environmental agencies, as well as for polluting enterprises. These Funds
receive the revenue from pollution fees applied to air emissions, water discharges, waste disposal, and,
in some cases, to the extraction of natural resources. Ten percent of this revenue goes directly into
the federal budget. Of the remaining 90 percent, amounts are allocated as follows: 10 percent to the
Federal Environment Fund, 30 percent to the relevant Oblast/Republic Environment Fund, and 60
percent to the relevant Municipal/Local Environment Fund.
2.58          Estimates of Federal Environmental Fund revenues provided by MEPNR were
approximately 10-25 billion rubles for 1992. The bulk of their funds (86 percent) were provided to
support research and development on resource-saving and nature-saving types of technologies and
equipment. Of the balance: 3.6 percent was provided to nature reserves and national parks; 3.6
percent was allotted to environmental impact statements and environmental expert review; 2.7 percent
to education and information dissemination; 0.8 percent to international cooperation; and the balance
to other undefined activities.
2.59          At the federal level, decision about allocating the central Ministry's share of the
Federal Fund are made by a National Board. Similar boards exist at territorial and local levels. The
law requires that the funds be spent on environmental protection activities. Beyond this, there appears
to be wide discretion in allocating the funds. Examples of uses of the Territorial Funds include such
activities as: scientific support for natural parks and environmental monitoring; storage facilities for
pesticides and agricultural chemicals; systems requirements for wastewater treatment; instruments for
environmental quality monitoring; recycling of hazardous wastes; and restoration of sites of historic
value. Allocations within geographical areas are based on the amounts collected within those areas.
This has the effect of raising the most money in those places where the environmental damages are
the greatest. However, problems arise, because enterprises withhold payment of these fees for various
reasons. As a result, the amount collected is well below the potential level. Moreover, local and
regional environment funds are often used to find non-environment related activities, further reducing
the potential for environmental improvement.
Summary of Key Crosscutting Issues
2.60          The Russian Federation has inherited an economic structure and obsolete technologies
that encourage pollution and inefficient resource use, as well as a large stock of accumulated
environmental problems.3' The capital requirements for addressing those problems and launching
mitigation measures are high by international standards. Therefore, it is imperative to carefully set
priorities and develop policies and strategies that will allow these priorities to be addressed over time
in a least-cost way.
2.61          However, the current environmental quality management system at all levels of
government is in a state restructuring and adaptation to the new economic and political realities in
Russia. Key issues that need to be addressed during the transition to a more effective system of
environmental management for pollution abatement and nature protection that can meet the special
3/ A number of regions have requested that the Federal Government designate them as Environrmental Emergency or Disaster Zones.



The Environment Sector                                                                19
demands of a new economic, political and social system include: (1) unreliability of the data; (2)
ineffectiveness of the legal and regulatory system; (3) poorly defined management and organizational
responsibilities; (4) inadequate budgetary allocations; (5) breakdown of the "command and control"
system and deficiencies in the oeconomic incentive structure for pollution abatement and nature
protection; (6) deficiencies in the methodologies and techniques used to derive emission limits for air
and water quality management and management of solid and hazardous wastes, including the ambient
environmental quality standards that have been adopted; and (7) insufficient financial incentives and
resources for companies to invest in environmental mitigation efforts.
2.62          Unreliability of environmental data. The old system of central planning and control
has left a legacy of inefficiency and mismanagement resulting from: unreliable basic information;
narrow segregation of responsibility; poor information dissemination and analysis; incomplete
accountability for performance or results; and, in certain cases, deliberate misreporting of
environmental data. In some cases Bank missions have found that the data provided was in
considerable error (i.e, by factors of 2 to 5 times). In many situations it is simply impossible to judge
by how much the data are in error. Due to insufficient budgets and lack of staff, the air and water
inspectorate in the MEPNR and its committees at oblast and local levels have to rely on the industrial
enterprises and municipal sewerage organizations to provide data on pollution emissions from their
facilities. In short, the current situation is such that no data generated by the system can be taken at
face value. Since the generation of reliable environmental information and its timely dissemination and
effective analysis are fundamental to efficient environmental management, this is clearly a priority area
for upgrading and improvement in any strategy for assistance to this sector.
2.63          Ineffective environmental protection laws and regulations. Another important issue
that adversely affects the ability of the MEPNR and its territorial branches to perform their regulatory
functions is the state of development of the legal system in the FSU. Environmental law was slow
to develop and environmental lawyers and law schools teaching environmental law are, therefore, rare
in Russia.
2.64          Poorly defined management and organizational responsibilities. Responsibilities for
environmental quality management are dispersed among many governmental agencies. They are
poorly coordinated leading to conflicts between agencies and inefficient use of the limited human and
financial resources available. The MEPNR is one of the more recently formed governmental
organizations, and has had great difficulty establishing its own leadership role in environmental
management. Further complicating the situation, a new Constitution has provided greater autonomy
to the regional and local governments.
2.65          Inadequate budget allocations. Even before the break-up of the FSU, the financial
resources available for environmental quality management were extremely limited. Some relief was
provided with the introduction of the pollution fee system and allocation of a proportion of these funds
to support environmental regulatory activities. However, the downturn in the economy, the pressing
social demands on limited government funds, and the effects of inflation have greatly eroded these
small gains. As a result the environmental management system is under severe financial stress. There
is a danger that well-trained and experienced personnel in pollution abatement and nature protection
will seek other occupations in order to survive the current economic crisis.
2.66          Breakdown of command-and-control system. With the breakdown of the centrally
planned economy, and the supporting administrative control system, there is an urgent need to rebuild
a new and more appropriate form of command-and-control system for pollution abatement and nature
protection compatible with the new economic structure.



20                                                          Environmental Management Project
2.67          Inappropriate criteria for emission standards. Some of the current ambient standards
in Russia for air, water and soil quality, are very stringent by international standards. Most industries
in the Russian Federation do not currently have the capacity to be able to comply and thereby call into
question the credibility of environmental policy. According to Bank missions, the methodologies and
techniques used to set emission limits also are out of date, and lead to inefficient and ineffective
pollution abatement and control mechanisms. The problems are further compounded by the lack of
EIA requirements in respect of investment projects.
2.68          Inadequate medium term investmentfunds. Enterprises are facing great pressure to
restructure their operations at a time when their financial resources are being cut through lower
government subsidies and soft credits. At the same time, the commercial banks are reluctant to
provide medium-term project investment financing due to a shortage of such funds and political risk
factors. There is, therefore, an urgent need to provide a source of medium-term loan funds to
enterprises so that they can also implement pollution mitigation measures.
C.    Government's Objectives and Strategy
2.69          Central and regional government officials are aware of the issues raised above, but
a clear and viable policy and strategy for dealing with continual decline in environmental management
for pollution abatement and nature protection are being realized very slowly. For instance, a list of
some forty laws and regulations currently being drafted by the MEPNR are not necessarily of high
priority and yet tie up the services of the very few environmental protection law specialists employed
by the MEPNR. The MEPNR and other government agencies with overlapping environmental
responsibilities have been the subject of several reorganizations that have not fully resolved the issue.
2.70          The one relatively clear government strategy that offers scope for interventions with
considerable likelihood of immediate success is that of devolution of administrative and legislative
powers to regional and local governments. Since local residents are becoming increasingly vocal in
their opposition to facilities that contaminate the environment, there is increasing pressures on these
local and regional governments to find solutions to environmental problems. Unfortunately the same
is not true of nature protection. Local pressures for economic development tend to minimize the social
value of protecting nature, focusing instead on the potential economic value of the natural resources
found in them. However, there are beginning to be more opportunities in Russia for satisfying regional
goals in both nature protection and economic growth, through sustainable and environmentally
acceptable development options (such as in forestry and agriculture).
2.71          Another important recent government policy initiative has been the introduction of
pollution fee system for industrial, agricultural and domestic discharges into air and water and onto
land. These fees are paid into environmental funds at the local, regional and federal level for
investments in pollution control, and to a lesser extent for research and for environmental management
purposes. While there are a number of improvements which need to be made in relation to the level
of fees assessed and in the efficiency of collection and utilization, there is already a sound basis for
an environmental economic incentive system in the Russian Federation.
2.72          The severe budget constraints being faced by government agencies and enterprises
alike are severely restricting their ability to address even the most urgent environmental quality and
natural resource depletion problems. Much scope, therefore, exists for short to medium term strategic
support from multilateral and bilateral financial sources to assist the Government in dealing with these
concerns.



The Environment Sector                                                             21
D.    Assistance Strategy for the Sector
2.73         Based on Bankwide experience, the best approach is to lead in to the sector through
a project to strengthen environmental management institutional capacity, and to assist Governments
in developing environmental policies, incorporating a balanced use of economic instruments, and
command and control approaches to promote the most efficient and effective management of
environmental quality and natural resources. Moreover, in order to assist Governments to demonstrate
some immediate environmental benefits to its citizens from such a program, an associated program
of investments in pollution control is needed. This should initially focus on the many possible
economic/environment "win-win" investments that improve economic performance and reduce
pollution at the same time. It is widely recognized among experienced practitioners in the field that
even for the "win-win" investments, certain economic/financial incentives may be necessary to
encourage enterprise managements to undertake such investments. This is particularly the case for
countries in transition to a market economy, where price distortions and other market imperfections
give signals to investors that are often contrary to the achievement of environmental goals.
E.    World Bank Role and Strategy
2.74         The most recent discussion of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Russia was
on April 28, 1994 in the context of the Financial Institutions Development Project. At that time, the
Bank proposed to operate under an Intermediate Case scenario that would include a core investment
program of projects that would be relatively unaffected by changes in the macroeconomic
environment. The proposed project forms part of the core program. It meets all three priority
objectives for the Bank's assistance program contained in the CAS by: (i) supporting the development
of a market-oriented economy by demonstrating through the National Pollution Abatement Facility
(NPAF) how to involve the private sector in projects with tangible environmental benefits; (ii)
redirecting public sector involvement in the economy by strengthening the policy-making and
regulatory activities of key institutions involved in environmental management and establishing a sound
technical and policy framework for future environmental activities; and (iii) establishing a key role for
the Bank in project design and helping to mobilize donor funds that might not otherwise be available
to support priority activities in environmental management. The GOR and Bank recognize the vital
importance of bilateral and multilateral grant funds in support of the environmental sector (including
biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of natural resources) at this critical stage in
Russia's economic transformation. A donors meeting hosted by the Bank on April 13, 1994, resulted
in pledges in support of the EFP amount to $90 million from Canada, the European Union, Finland,
Norway, Switzerland, the United States and the GEF.
1.    Framework of an Environmental Strategy
2.75         In the next two years, the Bank will assist the Government in improving its policy,
regulatory and institutional framework for environmental management at the federal level and in
selected regions to preserve and strengthen the existing environmental management infrastructure
during the period when the Government is trying to stabilize and restructure the nation's economy.
Because of its external debt problems, the Russian Federation will be only able to borrow Bank funds
for projects in the environmental field that are essentially self financing, and which meet the basic
economic/environment "win-win" criteria outlined above. In order to overcome the Government's
debt constraints, the proposed EMP links investments in such projects through a special pollution
abatement fund with assistance to improve and sustain the environmental management infrastructure.



22                                                        Environmental Management Project
2.76         In the medium term, the Bank expects to broaden the regional and sectorial focus of
its environmental operations while still meeting the above Government priorities. This could include
expanding the operations of the NPAF drawing on the experience of its first phase operations, as well
as on the results of regional and industrial subsector environmental studies and action plans being
developed under the environmental management components of EMP.
2.77         In the longer term, as the Government's restructuring efforts lead to greater capacity
for public financing and management of infrastructure investments at the regional and municipal
levels, and as privatization succeeds to a point where enterprises can self finance more environmental
investments, the Bank would foresee an expanded program in the environmental area based on
geographically focussed infrastructure investments for: (1)improved water supply and sewage
treatment; (2) urban air pollution control; and (3) solid and hazardous waste management, etc.
2.     Role of Bank in Relation to Other Donors
2.78         Since the beginning of the Bank's involvement in the environmental sector in Russia,
it has worked closely with the Government and bilateral donors in formulating an Environmental
Framework Program (EFP) for the Federation. The Bank sees its role as a facilitator (not as a
coordinator) assisting bilateral and multilateral donors to identify and meet the highest priority needs
of the country in this sector. The EFP seeks to identify some of these needs, but is not intended to
be fully comprehensive. For instance, the program does not address issues such as radiological
protection, management of nuclear wastes, or nuclear safety issues; neither does it address in detail
the natural resource and environmental management issues in the forestry, fisheries, agriculture, or
mining sectors. Some of these issues are being addressed by bilateral and multilateral agencies under
other programs. More details of the EFP are given in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 describes the EFP
Components that will be financed under the Environmental Management Project.
2.79         An important source of grant funds is the Global Environment Facility (GEF) which
has already approved a $3.2 million grant to the Russian Government to identify the major sources
of greenhouse gas emissions from the gas sector, which accounts for some 60% of the energy use in
Russia. In addition, a $500,000 project preparation advance from the GEF has also been approved
to prepare some 20-30 investment projects for the phase out of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) in
the aerosol and refrigeration industry sub-sectors, as well as processes for the conversion of ODS to
non-ODS substitutes. Currently the Danish Government is providing technical assistance to MEPNR
in supporting the development of the Country's ODS phase-out strategy. Application is being made
to the GEF for a US$25 million grant to support the Biodiversity Conservation program that has been
developed under EFP. The Canadian Government's NIS Task Force has financed the work of Parks
Canada, which has led to the formulation of a priority capital expenditure program for immediate
assistance to the Nature Protection areas in Russia. The McArthur Foundation (US) has also financed
World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) assistance in the preliminary work on a countrywide biodiversity
strategy.
2.80         In addition to these global activities, the UK Know-How Fund approved a $450,000
grant to prepare and set up the NPAF that will lend foreign exchange to enterprises for economically
and financially viable, export-oriented, pollution abatement projects.
3. Role of Bank in Relation to NGOs
2.81         Both national and international NGOs are playing an increasingly important role in
monitoring and raising awareness of the environmental quality and natural resource management issues



The Environment Sector                                                               23
which are of daily concern to Russian citizens. Especially, significant are the multitude of "grass
roots" NGOs that have sprung up throughout the Russian Federation, even dating back to the Soviet
period. Many of these organizations are loosely associated with two major national NGOs: the Socio-
Ecology Union (SEU) and the NGO Center under MEPNR. Because of their activism on issues of
critical concern to local communities and their frustrations in dealing with entrenched bureaucracies,
members of these organizations have become active in local politics and many have been elected to
local legislatures. These groups have now moved into positions of influence, not only at the local
level, but also at the regional and federal levels as well.
2.82         The Russian NGOs are also receiving considerable assistance from international
NGOs, which have linked up with them through an extensive E-mail network. In addition,
international NGOs are providing direct assistance through regional and local projects, particularly in
relation to sustainable agriculture and forestry practices, protection of watersheds and other small scale
community activities. Others have focussed on pollution issues, in particular nuclear waste disposal,
and marine pollution.
2.83          Under the direction of MEPNR, both the EFP and the EMP seek to foster the work
of the local NGOs through direct participation as members of subcomponent management committees,
as well as members of subcomponent implementation teams and as local experts assisting these teams.
Others will be involved as members of legislatures drafting and debating regulations which will put
into effect the results of the EMP. The MEPNR and the Bank are also in frequent contact with the
international NGOs that are active in Russia, and are working as partners with them, especially in
relation to biodiversity conservation and the conservation and management of natural resources (i.e.,
WWF) and International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), under funding from the GEF
and the McArthur Foundation.
F.    Relevant World Bank Experience in Other Environmental Projects and in Russia
1.    Environmental Management Projects
2.84         Three Bank assisted Environmental Management Projects in Indonesia, Chile and
Poland have provided valuable lessons for the preparation and implementation of this project. This
experience suggests that: limited absorptive capacity may exist in the federal Ministry of Environment;
responsibility for environmental and natural resource management may be dispersed across a number
of government ministries and agencies; confusion and frustration may result from uncoordinated donor
and multilateral agency support programs; full commitment to the program by the beneficiaries is
needed; strengthening of project implementation capacity prior to the loan avoids later delays; effective
supervision and strong support by Bank's Resident Mission is desirable; and a well-designed
monitoring and evaluation system to provide early warning of implementation delays is important.
2.85         These lessons have been incorporated into the design of the proposed project. Federal
Ministries in Russia are being down-sized and reorganized and budgets are being severely cut. For
this reason more than 80% of this project's funds will be directed to regional activities in three regions
west of the Urals. The problem of inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination and cooperation
in Russia is more difficult at the federal than at the regional levels, where common problems and
public pressure have resulted in greater collaboration. Pilot programs have been identified in those
regions where there is strong support by the heads of executive and legislative branches of
government, as well as the local population to ensure effective coordination. At the federal level heads
of different executive and legislative agencies and committees have been consulted at every stage of
the development of the project to ensure their cooperation. With severe budget cuts for all government



24                                                         Environmental Management Project
agencies, injection of funds through this project is a strong incentive for collaboration. Uncoordinated
donor programs for the environment sector in Russia have not presented a problem to date because
of MEPNR and donor support for a World Bank-lead role among the donors, and the collaboration
of Canada, Finland, the United Kingdom, and the United States in assisting the GOR to formulate the
EFP.
2.86          The main criteria for selecting pilot project sites for this program have been the
commitment and capacity of the regional executive and legislative authorities to address environmental
and natural resource management issues. The selected beneficiaries have all expressed their full
commitment to participating in the project and will be signatories to Framework Agreements setting
out their responsibilities and obligations under the project. The Government's commitment to the
project has been expressed in its request for a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance of
US$460,000. The demand for the EFP far exceeds the supply of resources that can be committed.
Because of experience in other Bank projects in Russia and Eastern Europe, preparation for the setting
up of the Center for Project Preparation and Implementation (CPPI) began during the first Bank
mission. A PPF advance was approved (in December 1992) to provide funding for the CPPI prior to
loan effectiveness and most of the legal, management and organizational issues have been resolved
during project preparation. The Director of the CPPI has already been selected. A General Consultant
Firm will be hired by the time of loan effectiveness to assist in project start-up activities and the
training of subcomponent project managers. This firm will also play a key role throughout the project
to independently evaluate the project's performance and progress on a tri-yearly basis. Development
impact indicators are defined in detail in Chapter IV and will be the focus of Bank supervision
missions. A permanent environmental coordinator is employed at the Moscow Resident Mission and
he will play an important role during supervision (as he has during preparation). An additional
Russian environmental specialist has been hired in the Resident Mission to reinforce this effort.
2.     Credit Lines for Pollution Abatement
2.87          The success of these operations in other countries can be judged by the fact that
Governments have requested follow up projects. In the case of Brazil, there have been three such
operations and in India, the first pollution control credit line of US$160 million was fully committed
within two years and the Government requested that the second pollution control project in the lending
pipeline be brought forward to meet the high demand for such investments. Initially, in the case of
Brazil, commitments were slow because of excessive requirements for information and cumbersome
appraisal procedures. Once these were simplified and streamlined and the geographical coverage of
the project extended beyond the City of Sao Paulo, the loan was committed very rapidly, especially
for projects in the heavily polluted industrial area of Cubatao. The second pollution control project
was also for the State of Sao Paulo, while the third project was extended to cover the entire country.
For the first two loans, mass emission rate criteria were used to identify high priority investments for
pollution control. While this was found to be a useful technique for SO2 reduction, because of the
predominance of industrial sources of SO2, in the case of dust there was little correlation between
investment in pollution control and environmental improvement because of the predominance of urban
pollution sources (mainly traffic). This experience illustrates the importance of identifying the major
pollution sources in an area or region across economic sectors when deciding priority investments for
pollution control.
2.88          The first credit line for pollution control in India funded seventy-six industrial
pollution abatement projects and nine common industrial liquid effluent treatment plants collecting
discharges from some 2,500 small scale industries. The average loan size was about US$2 million.
This loan also provided US$10 million in technical assistance to strengthen State Pollution Control



The Environment Sector                                                                  25
Boards in three states. The success of this project was attributed to a balanced use of economic
incentives and command and control measures (i.e., "carrots" and "sticks"). Economic incentives
included: (i) onlending rate set at 2% below market rate; (ii) 100% grant for preinvestment studies;
(iii) government grant contributions for the establishment of common treatment plants; (iv) government
grants to support the introduction of innovative pollution control technologies; and (v) accelerated
depreciation of pollution control investments, i.e., 100% depreciation allowance in the first year.
From the command and control perspective, there was strong state Government commitment to force
polluting industries into court actions for pollution violations, and even to plant closures. In both
India and Brazil, special units were set up in the onlending banks or pollution control agencies to assist
in project preparation and appraisal.
2.89          The NPAF proposed for Russia is of more modest scale and has more limited
objectives than described above, because of the focus on commercially viable resource recovery
pollution abatement projects. However, there are many similarities which make the lessons gained
from the previous Bank projects of particular relevance. These include: (i) setting up a technical
assistance unit under the Fund to assist in preparation and appraisal of subprojects; (ii) providing
financial assistance as part grants and loans for carrying out preinvestment studies; (iii) setting the
onlending rate slightly below the "market" rates and providing loans with longer term maturities; (iv)
assisting regional governments in three regions under the TA component of EMP to identify priority
pollution control investments and to strengthen pollution permitting, fee collection and enforcement
capacity; (v) carrying out environmental sector studies and development of pollution abatement action
plans in the major polluting industry sectors to assist in identifying investment priorities; and (vi) not
restricting investments to any particular region at this stage, although subprojects in European Russia
are likely to predominate. Moreover, financial projections for the NPAF are based on rather
conservative assumptions as indicated by the India and Brazil experiences. These include an average
loan size of $1.6 million and a three year commitment period for the Bank loan.
3.     Lessons from Other Bank Operations in Russia
2.90          Lessons learned from the first Oil Rehabilitation Project and other operations in Russia
highlight the importance of: (i) identifying a consistent committed counterpart team with sufficient
authority to move the project forward; (ii) coordinating among key interested parties at the federal and
regional levels on critical or controversial project issues; (iii) early detailed attention to procurement
and other implementation issues and the benefits of a PPF in this regard; and (iv) involving local
consultants and institutes in the process.  The design and preparation of the proposed project
anticipates all these issues, with the early setting up of the CPPI with a PPF advance; the setting up
of an interministerial working group to resolve critical project issues; and the drafting of Framework
Agreements between MEPNR and the regional committees responsible for subcomponent project
implementation.

RusSIAN FEDERATION
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
III. ENVIRONMENTAL FRAMEWORK PROGRAM (EFP)
A.    Framework Program Objectives
3.1          The Russian Federation has requested the World Bank to assist in establishing an
Environmental Framework Program (EFP) whose objectives are to (a) incorporate environmental and
natural resource management concerns directly into the economic, social and political adjustment
process at the federal and regional levels of government, including the executive and legislative
branches; (b) strengthen and streamline institutional and organizational structures for environmental
and natural resourze management; (c) improve environmental and natural resource policy and strategy
formulation and implementation; (d) upgrade environmental and natural resource management systems;
(e) strengthen financial delivery mechanisms to address priority environmental management investment
needs through the setting up and initial capitalization of a National Pollution Abatement Facility
(NPAF); and (f) facilitate the flow of donor and multilateral funds and resources to the environmental
protection sector.
B.    Framework Program Description
3.2          The EFP is estimated to cost a total of US$ 282 million over a period of
approximately four to five years. It addresses environmental and natural resource management issues
at federal, regional and local levels in demonstration areas across a wide spectra of natural areas and
from the North Caucasus in the southwest and Murmansk in the northwest to Khabarovsk in the east.
The EFP consists of eight principal components:
(1)   Institutional and Policy Strengthening:
(a) Policy and Regulatory Support;
(b) Environmental Epidemiology;
(c) Human Resources Development and Training;
(d) Regional and Local Pilot Demonstration Projects;
(2)    Air Quality Management;
(3)    Water Quality and Water Resource Management;
(4)    Hazardous Waste Management;
(5)    Biodiversity Conservation and Natural Resources Management;
(6)    Conservation and Management of Cultural and Natural Heritage;
(7)    Setting Up and Capitalization of a National Pollution Abatement Facility; and
(8)    Center for Project Preparation and Implementation
1.    Institutional and Policy Strengthening Component (US$47.0 milion)
3.3          Activities planned within the institutional  strengthening and policy upgrading
component fall into two categories. The first are activities for the federal and regional levels of
government, that will address institutional and policy issues that are critical for strengthening
organizational and management structures and to improving financial management for environmental



Framework Program                                                                  27
and nature protection within the MEPNR and other federal and regional agencies. The second are
activities that address specific environmental issues at selected regional and local sites. These
activities focus on developing local action plans to address priority environmental concerns in a least-
cost way. These local environmental actions plans will include assistance to strengthen local
enforcement measures and upgrade local environment management capabilities. However, the World
Bank project described in Chapter IV focusses only on activities at the federal and regional levels.
3.4          The federal and regional activities have been divided into three subcomponents and
reflect the priorities identified for assistance by the MEPNR, the World Bank and bilateral donors
(a)    Policy and Regulatory Support;
(b)    Environmental Epidemiology;
(c)    Human Resources Development and Training.
1(a)         Policy and Regulatory Support (US$21.1 million)
3.5          Responsibility for policy on environmental issues is currently dispersed across MEPNR
as well as other Ministries and State Committees. There is a need to consolidate these activities and
to develop the capacity to formulate and implement policies designed to achieve clear environmental
goals at both federal and regional levels. As outlined in Annex 3. 1, the key elements of support to
achieve this objective are:
3     establish a Federal Environmental Policy Unit responsible to the Federal Commission
on the Environment;
3     agree on a clear set of environmental priorities and of measures designed to address
these priorities based on an assessment of the extent of and trends in environmental
damage across sectors and regions;
3     develop the economic, legal and institutional framework for the implementation of
these measures;
-     prepare and implement a small number of Sectoral Environmental Action Plans with
the target of reducing the environmental damage to human health and ecosystems
caused by these sectors by 25-50 percent over 3-5 years;
*     prepare and implement a small number of Regional Environmental Action Plans
designed to achieve significant improvements in environmental conditions in some
heavily polluted regions;
*     negotiate agreements with major emission sources in the sectors and regions covered
by the project to achieve phased reductions in emissions over 3-5 years; and
*     develop the capacity of regional environmental authorities to implement and monitor
targeted programs of environmental improvement.
1(b)   Environmental Epidemiology Component (US$9.0 million)
3.6           As outlined in Annex 3.2, this component will focus on strengthening the national and
regional environmental epidemiology management system for: (i) the collection and management of



28                                                        Environmental Management Project
data relevant to environmental health issues; (ii) the identification of the most urgent problems and
an analysis of the causes responsible for damage to health most relevant for policy making; and (iii)
the development of policies to address such problems and to monitor their success. Building upon
existing efforts to prepare a national program for, and regular review of environmental health in
Russia, the environmental epidemiology component would focus on the following activities at national
and regional levels:
*     establish a Federal Environmental Epidemiology Center and strengthen national
facilities and institutes in Moscow;
*     establish two Regional Environmental Epidemiology Centers in the Urals and the
Upper Volga regions;
*     establish a regional capacity for incorporating environmental health data into
environmental management decision making;
*     improve the existing system for collecting, managing and analyzing data on infant and
child health as the most sensitive indicator of environmental health;
*     develop and incorporate occupational health data systems into environmental
management decision making at the federal and regional levels;
*     develop a series of training courses for environmental health; and
*     develop twinning relationships with foreign environmental health institutes.
1(c)   Human Resources Development and Training Component (US$3.8 million)
3.7          As discussed in Annex 2, the focus of this component is to develop suitable training
courses to train trainers and to develop the capacity of existing Russian institutions to continue ongoing
training courses for environmental management. The subject areas that have been identified as the
highest priority are:
*     policy, programming and decision making at the federal and regional levels;
*     operation proficiency and managerial capabilities within the Ministry;
*     public education, participation and conflict resolution; and
*     environmental regulatory enforcement capabilities of the MEPNR and regional
committees.
I(d)   Regional and Local Pilot Demonstration Projects (US$13.1 million)
3.8          Four regional and local pilot demonstration institutional development projects (see
Annex 2) are proposed under the framework program in the following regions and cities:
(i)    Khabarovsk Krai
(ii)    Nizhnii Tagil
(iii)   Novokuznetsk
(iv)   Murmansk Oblast



Framework Program                                                                  29
These pilot projects will focus on:
*     developing local and regional environmental strategies and action plans;
*     strengthening institutional arrangements for environmental management;
*     testing and implementing new environmental policies and regulations for adoption
nationwide;
improving training and education in environmental issues and concerns; and
*     improving environmental management at the enterprise level.
2.    Air Quality Management Component (US$17.8 million)
3.9          Many cities in Russia have significant air pollution problems with pollutant
concentrations over 10 times the Maximum Pollutant Concentration (MPC) level. However, in order
to develop the Air Quality Management system (AQM) the region of Volgograd was selected as the
pilot site for this component. The objective of the project are to: (i) characterize air quality in
Volgograd using modern monitoring methodologies; (ii) improve AQM principles, policies, and
compliance methods; (iii) improve the Russian Federation's technical approach to solving air quality
problems and develop a preliminary least cost strategy in Volgograd as a demonstration; and (iv) to
disseminate the results of this pilot project throughout Russia as an improved AQM system nationwide.
The project (see Annex 2) would involve the following activities:
*     evaluation of existing methodologies and measurement methods for air emission
estimation and ambient air quality;
*     assessment of the current system of defining air quality sources;
*     improving emission inventory methods, source test methods and emission factors;
*     reviewing and revising atmospheric dispersion modelling, air quality monitoring and
siting of monitors, quality assurance methods, and development of nationwide data
information systems;
*     improving and revising the system for regulating new and existing air emission
sources and modifications of sources;
*     developing  methods for assessing  and  managing  pollutant transport and
transboundary/global air pollution problems through local and regional AQM
programs;
*     upgrading laboratory and field measurement capabilities and monitoring procedures
in Volgograd for ambient air and source emissions;
*     demonstration of source testing, saturation monitoring, receptor and airshed
modelling;



30                                                        Environmental Management Project
*     development of least cost AQM strategies for Volgograd;
*     improving AQM regulations; and
*     improving AQM enforcement capabilities.
3.     Water Quality and Water Resource Management Component (US$28 million)
3.10         The priorities for environmental management in the water sector in Russia (see
Annexes 2 and 3.3) have been identified as follows: (i) ensure the availability and supply of safe
drinking water; (ii) restore and maintain the ecological health of rivers and other water bodies; and
(iii) promote water conservation and strengthen integrated water quality and quantity management.
These priorities are reflected in the program of fourteen pilot projects in five water sheds or regions
(see Table A2.1 of Annex 2) that have been identified for funding under this component. The
objectives of these pilot projects are to:
*     reduce human health risks from unsafe drinking water supplies;
*     develop more effective regulatory policies from point and non-point sources of
pollution;
*     improve discharge permitting systems and compliance;
*     improve efficiency and operation of existing and new drinking water treatment plants;
*     develop basin and water body specific ambient water quality standards more closely
related to actual local water uses;
*     develop capacity to carry out integrated, short-term water quality assessments and
identify priorities;
*     develop basin scale integrated water quality management plans to achieve ambient
standards;
*     improve industrial pre-treatment pollution control;
*     develop economic incentives for water conservation and efficient water use;
*     develop institutional arrangements to enable integrated water quality and water
resource management; and
*     increase public awareness and understanding of the value of water.
4.    Hazardous Waste Management Component (US$16.9 million)
3.11         The effective management of industrial waste generally and hazardous waste in
particular represents a major environmental priority in Russia. The current policy objectives in this
area are: (i) reduction of hazardous waste production; (ii) increasing the reuse and recovery of
resources from these wastes; (iii) mitigation of impacts of past management practices; and (iv)
developing effective controls over their generation and management.  The Hazardous Waste



Framework Program                                                                     31
Management Component (see Annexes 2 and 3.4) is intended to assist the country in achieving these
objectives through the three following strategic subcomponent projects targeted at the national,
regional and enterprise specific levels respectively:
*     Development of a national hazardous waste data management system, providing a
capability within the federal government to collect, consolidate and evaluate waste
generation and disposition information, such that problems and issues can be
prioritized, policies established, and resources efficiently allocated;
*     Development and demonstration of a regulatory management system at the regional
level in Vologda and Yaroslavl Oblasts, which cover the classification, tracking,
permitting and measurement capacity required for "cradle to grave" management of
these wastes and which can be emulated elsewhere in the country; and
*     Undertaking enterprise specific waste management related environmental management
studies in six strategic industrial sectors: oil refining; steel making; metal fabrication;
printing; paint production; and chemicals, with the objective of demonstrating current
waste management practices as part of modernization and conversion initiatives.
5.     Biodiversity Conservation and National Resource Management Component (US$27.2
million)
3.12          The first two subcomponents would be supported under the project and the third
subcomponent would be financed through a Swiss grant ($3 million).
3.13          The objective of this component (see Annex 2) is to strengthen government capacity
to manage its natural resources, including biodiversity in an sustainable way. The project will assist
the government in three major areas:
*     Formulation of a biodiversity strategy, and through it generation of a national
consensus on priorities regarding the allocation and use of natural resources. Given
the multi-dimensional and multi-sectoral nature of such a strategy, its formulation will
draw decision-makers from different sectors and agencies and will help Government
to incorporate environmental concerns into its macro-reform agenda.
*     Protection of areas that are central to the conservation of an adequate level of
biodiversity, with special emphasis on the national park and nature reserve systems.
Protection of these areas is now critical, as the deteriorating economic situation is
increasing pressure for the use of protected area resources, both by industry and by
neighboring communities, who are seeking to exploit these resources for their
livelihood.
*     Management of natural resources located in the Lake Baikal Region-an area still
abundant in natural resources and with a major resource stock of vital interest to the
Russian Federation and to the world at large. Regional approaches to natural resource
management will be put in place under the project.

6.    Conservation and Management of Cultural and Natural Heritage (US$2.7 milion)
3.14         The Conservation and Management of Cultural and National Heritage component (see
Annex 2) consists of three main activities: (i) Policy and Regulatory Support; (ii) Institution Building
and Strengthening of Management and Implementation Mechanisms; and (iii) Development of a
National Program for the Conservation and Management of Cultural and Natural Heritage.
3.15         In addition to improving the management of cultural heritage, this component will:
*     provide necessary financial and technical assistance to improve the protection of the
nation's heritage;
*     assist the Government of Russia to develop its national cultural and natural heritage
strategy within the context of current macro policy changes;
*     strengthen institutional capacity to ensure the coordinated and effective administration
and implementation of the policy, particularly in regard to the linkage between
environmental, economic, natural resource, and cultural heritage policies;
*     support legislative and administrative reform pertaining to cultural and natural heritage
conservation; and
*     promote the training of staff and encourage the participation of local communities.
7.    National Pollution Abatement Facility (US$137 million)
3.16         Discussions on this component are in Chapter IV and Annex 4.
8.    Center for Project Preparation and Implementation (US$5.5 million)
3.17         Discussions on this component are in Chapter IV and Annex 7.
C.    EFP Cost and Financing Plan
3.18         The estimated cost of the Environmental Framework Program is summarized in Table
3.1. The total cost of the proposed program is estimated at US$282.1 million (including taxes and
duties, as well as physical and price contingencies) with a foreign exchange component of US$149.6
million, or 53% of the total program cost. The Bank loan would finance US$110 million, or 39%
of the total program. As agreed at a Donors Meeting on April 13, 1994, the current EFP financing
package includes grant funds from the following countries and organizations: Canada; EU; Finland;
Norway; Switzerland; USA; and the GEF. The total amount pledged by these agencies was
approximately US$90 million. This financing will be achieved through parallel cofinancing and will
be coordinated by the CPPI. The balance of the financing (US$92 million) would be provided by the
GOR, as well as Russian enterprises and commercial banks.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RuSsIAN FEDERATION
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
IV. THE PROJECT
A.    Project Objectives
4.1          The Environmental Management Project (EMP) would provide critical support to the
EFP. The main objectives of the project are to assist the Russian authorities to: (i) strengthen and
streamline federal and regional institutional structures for environmental and natural resource
management; (ii) improve federal and regional environmental policy and strategy formulation and
implementation; (iii) upgrade environmental and natural resource management systems; (iv) assist in
the financing of economically viable, high priority resource recovery/pollution abatement projects in
the country; and (v) facilitate the flow of donor funds and resources to the environmental protection
sector.
B.    Project Description
4.2          The EMP consists of the following five main components:
1.    Institutional and Policy Strengthening:
(a)    Policy and Regulatory Support; and
(b)    Environmental Epidemiology;
2.    Core Elements of the Water Quality and Water Resource Management Component;
3.    Core Elements of the Hazardous Waste Management Component;
4.    National Pollution Abatement Facility; and
5.    Center for Project Preparation and Implementation.
4.3          The first three technical assistance subcomponents of the EMP will focus on
environmental management and institutional strengthening at the federal and regional levels in three
regions of European Russia: the Upper Volga, the Urals and North Caucasus. An integrated
approach to regional environmental management will be achieved through the Policy and Regulatory
Support Component, which will closely link with the Environmental Epidemiology, Water Quality and
Water Resource Management, and Hazardous Waste Components in identifying, developing and
setting policies and regulations for implementation by regional environmental regulatory agencies, and
at the federal level.
4.4          Activities under the Policy and Regulatory Support Component will provide the
integrating framework for the whole EMP. The Environmental Epidemiology component has been
designed to provide the basis for setting environmental priorities at both the federal and the regional
levels. Drawing upon the assessment of the impact of environmental problems on human health, the



The Project                                                                                               35
goal is to ensure that the environmental targets are directed to achieving the best feasible reductions
in mortality and morbidity linked to environmental causes. Similarly, the Water Quality Management
and Hazardous Waste Management components (as well as the Air Quality Management Project under
the EFP) will draw upon the environmental assessments and priorities, policy and regulatory
development, sectoral studies and regional action plans, which form the core elements of the Policy
and Regulatory component. Finally, the National Pollution Abatement Facility (NPAF) will follow
the environmental damage assessments and priorities in determining which proposals should receive
priority funding. Where its project criteria are met, the resources of the NPAF can also be used to
support the implementation of the Sectoral Environmental Action Plans.
I(a)    Policy and Regulatory Support Component (US$21.1 million)
4.5              The overall objective of this component (for more details see Annex 3.1) is to help
accelerate a reduction in environmental damage in the Urals and Upper Volga regions within a period
of 3-5 years with a particular focus on mitigating the impact of pollution on human health-'. To meet
this goal there will be a need to:
*       develop the capacity at federal and regional levels to set environmental priorities, to
formulate, implement and enforce environmental policies, and to monitor
environmental conditions; and
*       establish  the  administrative, economic, legal and  technical basis for reaching
negotiated agreements to reduce emissions from specific industries in a particular
region.
4.6              The successful achievement of these subsidiary objectives at federal level and in two
demonstration regions will provide a foundation for extending the approach to other regions in Russia,
as well as for ensuring continued progress in reducing environmental damage in the Urals and the
Upper Volga regions. Thus, the component will contribute to the ultimate objective of ensuring that
economic recovery and development in Russia over the next 5-10 years is accompanied by
improvements in environmental conditions rather than by a deterioration as in the past.
4.7              The component will be implemented by establishing a Federal Environmental Policy
Unit in Moscow and Two Regional Environmental Policy Units in Ekaterinburg (Urals region covering
the Chelyabinsk, Perm and Sverdlovsk oblasts) and in Yaroslavl (Upper Volga region covering the
Yaroslavl and Vologda oblasts). The Project Implementation Manual contains draft framework
agreements outlining the implementation arrangements.
4.8              The Federal Environmental Policy Unit will be responsible to the newly established
Federal Commission on the Environment which oversees environmental issues across a range of
ministries and state committees on behalf of the Council of Ministers (i.e., the Government). The key
activities of the Federal Environmental Policy Unit will include:
4/ The economic and social returns from the successful implementation of this component will be extremely high. A very modest target
would be to accelerate reductions of 10 percent in ambient levels of particulates, heavy metals, sulfur dioxide and toxic hydrocarbons in
the main cities of the two regions by five years relative to what would have happened in the absence of the project. Experience in preparing
the Environmental Action Program for Central and Eastem Europe for the 1993 Luceme conference suggests that this can be achieved by
.win-win" measures which involve zero net economic costs other than the policy work and associated technical assistance to be financed
under this component. On this basis the economic rate of return for the component in terms of the reduction in environmental damage to
human health will exceed 200 percent even on the most conservative assumptions for valuing the costs of excess mortality and morbidity.



36                                                                    Environmental Management Project
*       preparing assessments of the extent of and trends in environmental damage across
sectors and regions and recommending priorities for federal environmental policies
based on damage to human health and to ecosystems caused by pollution, natural
resource use and other environmental causes;
*       developing the economic, legal and institutional framework and capacity for the
implementation of federal environmental policies and regulations;
*       working  with  non-environmental ministries  and  agencies to  ensure  that the
environmental costs or benefits of measures adopted by those bodies are taken fully
into account when decisions on economic policies, investments and other matters are
made;
*       preparing and implementing a set of Sectoral Environmental Action Plans for five
sectors: (a) iron and steel; (b) non-ferrous metals; (c) oil refining and petrochemicals;
(d) basic organic and inorganic chemicals; and (e) agriculture with particular attention
to intensive livestock operations-';
*       reviewing and updating the National Environmental Action Plan at regular intervals
in the light of changing environmental conditions and priorities;
*       coordinating and supporting the work carried out in the Regional Units with a
particular emphasis on assisting them in the negotiation of emission reduction
agreements with the major emission sources within the sectors covered in the Sectoral
Environmental Action Plans; and
*       providing technical assistance support to the NPAF for project feasibility studies and
project appraisals (see para 4.66).
4.9             The Regional Environmnental Policy Units will be responsible to the inter-oblast
environmental councils which have been, or are being, established in the two regions and will work
closely with the oblast authorities with environmental responsibilities -- including the oblast branches
of federal ministries and state committees, oblast administrations and the environment committees of
oblast parliaments. The advantage of working through the inter-oblast environmental councils is that
for the same investment, activities can be initiated simultaneously in two or three adjacent oblasts.
However, the regional unit will be located in one of the oblasts that will provide all the necessary
basic support infrastructure for the unit. The work program of each Regional Environmental Policy
Unit will include:
*       the preparation and updating of Oblast Environmental Action Plans which will provide
the basis for setting specific targets for mitigating environmental damage within the
framework of the project drawing upon the work to be undertaken under the
Environmental Epidemiology Component;
51 Parallel sectoral activities are underway, or planned for two other sectors. The preparation of a Sectoral Environmental Action Plan
for the pulp and paper industry is being funded by the Finnish Goverment. An extensive review of the forestry sector - funded as part
of the Bank's sector work program with additional assistance from GEF and bilateral donors - should start later in 1994 and may lead to
a project which could follow up the environmental recommendations that emerge from the sector work.



The Project                                                                               37
*      applying federal environmental policies and regulations at oblast level in a manner that
is consistent with the priorities and targets established in the Oblast Environmental
Action Plans;
*      providing policy and regulatory support for the Water Quality Management and
Hazardous Waste Management components of the EMP;
*      negotiating agreements with major emission sources to achieve phased reductions in
emissions over the period of the project by drawing upon technical advice provided
by the sectoral studies and teams, as well as the economic and regulatory incentives
and penalties available to the provincial authorities; and
*      monitoring the effectiveness of environmental measures and recommending changes
designed to enhance their impact, or to take account of new information or changing
circumstances.
4.10          The assistance will be provided over a period of 4 years starting in November 1994.
The first 4 months of the project will be primarily devoted to providing specialized training courses
in environmental law and environmental policy for the prospective staff of the Federal and Regional
Units, as well as on establishing offices and procuring equipment. Thus, the Federal and Regional
Units' are expected to start full operation in April 1995.
4.11          A Policy and Regulatory Management Committee will be established by the Federal
Commission on the Environment to supervise the implementation of the component.  This
Management Committee will include representatives from the Ministries and State Committees
represented on the Commission, as well as representatives from other economic Ministries such as the
Ministries of Fuel and Energy and of Industry which will either be affected by, or should work with
the Federal and Regional Units. Subject to the agreement of the Bank, the Management Committee
will appoint a Project Manager for the Policy and Regulatory Component who will also serve as the
Director of the Federal Environmental Policy Unit.
4.12          The Federal and Regional Units will be staffed by Russian experts. The Federal Unit
will have a Director (the Project Manager), a Deputy Director who will be a qualified environmental
lawyer-' and will also act as the Unit's Chief Legal Adviser, and three team leaders for the federal,
regional and sectoral teams. At least 5 of the staff of the Federal Unit will be qualified environmental
lawyers, and a further 5 will have postgraduate qualifications in economics plus training in
environmental economics. It will be condition of employment in the professional grades of the
Federal and Regional Units, except for the Director, that individuals must pass either a intensive 2-3
month training course in environmental law or one in environmental policy analysis before they join
the staff.
4.13          The Urals Regional Unit will have a Director (at the same level as the team leaders
in the Federal Unit), at least 5 qualified environmental lawyers and 3 staff with postgraduate
qualifications in economics plus training in environmental economics. The Upper Volga Regional Unit
will have a Director, at least 3 qualified environmental lawyers and 2 staff with postgraduate
qualifications in economics plus training in environmental economics.
6/ In this context a qualified environmental lawyer is someone with a recognized law degree involving at least 112] semesters of higher
education plus a satisfactory performance in a full-time one semester course on environmental law such as that provided in the training
program for prospective staff.

4.14         A Policy and Regulatory Consultant will be appointed to provide policy advice and
to undertake specific studies during the course of the project. The terms of reference for this contract
will specify an initial set of studies and policy advice, as well as an overall level of effort and set of
skills for the remainder of the work to be undertaken. In selecting the consultant a strong preference
will be given to proposals which are based on a team drawing on experience with environmental
policymaking and implementation in several countries with differing legal systems and approaches to
economic incentives and environmental regulations.
4.15         A Training Consultant will be appointed to design and organize the formal training
courses to be provided at the beginning of the project and the program of secondments. The
consultant should include a Russian training institution in its team, which can be responsible for taking
over and providing the formal training courses after the first year. The program of secondments
proposed by the consultant should cover more than one country, so that preference will be given to
consultants which can put together consortia of policy institutes and other appropriate agencies in
several countries.
4.16         In addition to the Policy and Regulatory Consultant and the Training Consultant, there
will be sector consultancy contracts, one for each of the sectors to be covered by the Federal Sectoral
Team. Each of these consultants will be responsible for drawing up a Sectoral Environmental Action
Plan in cooperation with the Sectoral Team in the Federal Unit and with the relevant Regional Units.
It will then be expected to provide support and advice for the process of implementing the Action
Plan, especially with respect to the development of technical and economic proposals to underpin the
negotiation of emission reduction agreements with major polluters in the sector. Some of these
sectoral activities may be funded by bilateral donors in a manner similar to the development of an
Environmental Action Plan for the Pulp and Paper Sector which is being funded by the Finnish
Government.
1(b)   Environmental Epidemiology Component (US$9.0 million)
4.17         A large body of work on environmental health is being undertaken at both the national
and oblast levels in the Russian Federation. However, the quality of the data and methods used are
inconsistent and there has been no coordinated attempt to develop a national strategy to identify,
evaluate and address threats to human health from environmental pollution. In the past, horizontal
flows of information were very limited, so that local and regional officials were unable to pool
knowledge and experience in dealing with environmental health issues. Even now they find it difficult
to evaluate local concerns in the context of national problems and priorities.
4.18         The objective of Environmental Epidemiology Component (Annex 3.2) will be to
strengthen the national and regional environmental epidemiology management system for: (i) the
collection and management of data relevant to environmental health issues; (ii) the identification of
the most urgent problems and an analysis of the causes responsible for damage to health most relevant
for policy making; and (iii) the development of policies to address such problems and to monitor their
success. In summary, the environmental epidemiology component will focus on the following
activities which will be incorporated into three interlinked subcomponent projects: one at the federal
level; and two at the regional level (in the Urals and Upper Volga regions).
(a)    Establish a Federal Environmental Epidemiology Center and strengthen federal
facilities and institutes in Moscow with particular emphasis on developing the capacity
to provide assessments of environmental health priorities relevant for national
legislation and policy.



The Project                                                                        39
(b)    Establish two Regional Environmental Epidemiology Centers to provide the essential
expertise for the collection and analysis of data, and support for environmental and
health officials in regional and local governments. Undertake specific investigations
of the impact that emissions from individual plants have on the health of the
population at risk.
(c)    Develop the capacity to enable regional authorities in the Urals region and the region
of the Upper Volga to develop their own policy priorities based on regionai
assessments of environmental health conditions.
(d)   Improve the existing system for generating, collecting, managing and analyzing data
on infant and child health as the basis for monitoring the consequences of changes in
population exposures to various pollutants. Data on variables such as the birth
weight, birth defects, infant diseases and child development can be sensitive indicators
for the impact of environmental conditions on the population in general.
(e)   Improve the existing Russian system to design and manage a program to collect and
analyze data on the health status and environmental conditions of workers in different
industrial sectors of the economy and populations in industrial sanitary zones, who are
at greatest risk due to environmental health impacts.
(f)    Develop and provide a series of policy orientated training courses in environmental
epidemiology.
(g)    Promote twinning relationships with foreign institutes responsible for policy orientated
environmental epidemiology work.
4.19         The responsible department in MEPNR for this component is the Department of
Ecological Safety.  The Project Implementation Manual contains draft framework agreements
describing the implementation arrangements for the component.  A Component Management
Commnittee consisting of representatives of MEPNR,  the State Committee for Sanitary and
Epidemiological Surveillance (GOSKOMSANEPIDNADZOR), the State Committee for
Hydrometereology (ROSGIDROMET), the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences has been set up to
advise and supervise the work of the Subcomponent Project Managers and their teams at federal and
regional levels. The Federal Program Manager will be responsible for the management of the federal
level subcomponent, and the coordination of the two regional initiatives. He will be responsible for
the federal subcomponent technical subject areas such as the annual federal report, federal databases
and policy oriented analyses. He will be an ex-officio member of the subcomponent Management
Committee and will be assisted in his work by the General Consultant Firm (see para 4.84), as
outlined in this firm's Terms of Reference.
4.20         The federal Subcomponent Project Manager will lead a team of Russian experts who
have been seconded to work full time on the project. A Foreign Consultant Firm will provide foreign
advisors to work with this team, as well as the two regional implementation teams in the Urals and
Upper Volga under regional Subcomponent Project Managers. The two regional Subcomponent
Project Managers will report to Regional Subcomponent Management Committees under the Upper
Volga and Urals Inter-regional Environmental Councils, respectively. The foreign contract for this
component is expected to be awarded to one general contractor, representing a consortium of research
institutes and academia from at least two continents. The assistance will extend over a period of 4



40                                                       Environmental Management Project
years starting in November 1994. Approximately two-thirds of the Consultant's inputs are expected
to be provided in the second and third year of the contract. The Consultant would liaise closely with
other teams undertaking work for other components of the Environmental Management Project.
Training is a crucial element. Much of it will take place through close and continuing collaboration
between foreign advisors and their local counterparts. A part of the formal training program is
designed to precede implementation of the project.
2     Core Elements of the Water Quality Management and Water Resource Management
Component (US$12.4 million)
4.21         The core program of the Water Quality and Water Resources Management Component
(Annex 3.3) focuses on developing and testing solutions to the major water quality management
problems in three key regions: (a) the Upper Volga River basin; (b) the Urals region; and (c) the
North Caucasus region. The subcomponent in each region will consist of an integrated planning and
regulatory reform program aimed at improving drinking water supplies, developing a prioritized
investment and action program, and addressing key sectoral policy issues. Each subcomponent will
also support existing regional organizations and improved regional inter-agency management of
priority issues. In addition, the component will support a Federal Program to provide mechanisms
within the project to disseminate the results of subcomponent projects to others who are not directly
participating in project activities, and to create the opportunity for those working on various
subcomponent projects to meet periodically to exchange experiences. This federal program will be
executed by a Subcomponent Implementation Team under the MEPNR's Department of Surface Water
Protection. The regional programs will be executed by subcomponent implementation teams reporting
to oblast or inter-oblast councils or committees. The Project Implementation Manual contains draft
framework agreements describing these arrangements. It is planned to implement this program over
a period of four years.
(a)    Upper Volga Rver Basin This is a vast region of forests and farms with a modest
population concentrated in an number of large industrial cities and important tourist areas located in
the riverain environment of the Volga River. The river is the main source of water supply for the
region's population, is an important fishery, navigation and transportation link, and source of
hydroelectric power. The subcomponent will support the newly formed Inter-regional Council of the
Upper Volga formed by the five concerned Oblasts with the goal of improving and restoring the
ecological condition of the Upper Volga River. The objectives of the subcomponent include the
identification of strategies and priority investment programs to improve the quality and efficiency of
water supply systems in selected cities, assess alternative region economic policy options to address
management of water use and quality, and develop regulatory reform programs for industrial and
municipal water management.
4.22         In response to a growing regional concern for and recognition of these issues, the five
oblasts which constitute the Upper Volga River basin - Vologda, Ivanovo, Kostroma, Yaroslavl, and
Tver - have formed the Interregional Ecological Council of Upper Volga with the goal of improving
and restoring the ecological condition of the Upper Volga River. The Council consists of six voting
members including the Chairman of the respective Oblast Environmental Committees and the
Chairman of the Council. Representatives of regional NGOs and environmental organizations,
academic and technical organizations in the region, and others may participate in the work of the
Council and have the right of an advisory vote. The current Chairman is the Director of the Institute
of Inland Water Biology in Borok. The members have agreed to form an Interregional Environmental
fund to support the Council's activities financed by contributions from the respective Oblast
Environmental Funds.



The Project                                                                         41
4.23         The competence of the Council includes formulating and making recommendations on
urgent actions for improvement of ecological conditions in the Upper Volga;  determining
mechanisms to finance programs and actions including the determination of Oblast contributions;
adopting joint decisions on disputed intra-regional issues; making recommendations on permanent or
temporary stoppage of industrial discharges; organizing and carrying out regional ecological studies;
organizing international environmental cooperation;  and adopting an annual budget including
allocations of the Upper Volga Ecological Fund to various activities.
4.24         The Council in collaboration with the respective oblast environment committees will
be responsible for supervising the work of the Subcomponent Implementation Team.   Foreign
consultants and regional expertise, including the scientific institutes and universities located in the
region will assist the Subcomponent Implementation Team to carry out the work, and will be
supplemented as necessary by specialized expertise at other Russian institutes. Study tours and
collaboration with foreign specialists will be used to review experience in the OECD countries with
the policy, institutional, and technical issues and options to be considered in this region.
(b)    North Caucasus Region  This subcomponent will focus on the problems of integrated
water management and conservation in the Lower Don River basin (from the Tsimlyansk reservoir
to the Azov sea) in the Rostov Oblast.   The Don River is one of the largest rivers in european
Russia. It has been intensively developed for irrigation, hydropower, and water supply. The water
supply and waste water management problems of the large cities of this region, including Rostov,
include supply deficits characterized by intermittent service, microbiological contamination due to the
lack of treatment capacity and inadequate maintenance of the distribution systems. Reduced flows
brought about by the more intensive irrigation water use, including reservoir storage, have led to
increased salinity in the Azov sea, and pollution in its highly urbanized and industrialized lower basin
have resulted in major fisheries and ecological damage. The objectives of the subcomponent include
the development of prototype monitoring systems, demonstration of small watershed management
practices, development of strategies and prioritized investment programs for improving water supply
and municipal wastewater treatment, and the development of integrated strategies for regional water
management and conservation focusing in particular on improvement in water supply availability and
restoration of the riverain ecosystem in the Lower Don River.
4.25         The Don River Basin Agency (Don BVO), in collaboration with the Rostov Oblast
Committee for the Protection of Nature, will be responsible for implementation of this subcomponent
project. The tasks will be carried out by working groups involving Russian specialists from such
institutions as the North-Caucasus Branch of the Russian Institute for Integrated Utilization and
Protection of Water Resources, the Azov Sea Research Institute of Fishery Problems, Rostov
University, Hydrochemical Institute and others. The work will be coordinated with the international
Black Sea program, coordinated by the World Bank (project results will be directly used for
development of the Black Sea recommendations). Working relationships will be established with the
non-governmental environmental organizations. The activity will include foreign and local training
components, consultations of foreign specialists, and supply of necessary equipment specified
tentatively in the project cost estimates.
(c)    The Urals Region This subcomponent will be located in the major industrial city of
Ekaterinburg, and will focus on the problems of integrated management of the raw and treated water
supply of Ekaterinburg. The large concentration and rapid growth of industry and population
combined with periodic droughts, especially over the last 50 years, has led to the development of
complex water management systems comprising numerous reservoirs and inter-regional transfers.
Public heath officials believe that environmental conditions in the oblast and surrounding areas, which



42                                                      Environmental Management Project
have greatly effected the quality of drinking water supplies, have been a primary factor in the reported
higher than average incidence of disease and worsening morbidity rates. The objectives of this
subcomponent include assessment of the threat to public health from drinking water supplies and
sources of supply for Ekaterinburg; evaluation and prioritization of current infrastructure needs and
the institutional and technical framework for supplying potable water and protecting its quality;
recommend physical, operational, legal, financial, and institutional improvements; demonstrate specific
measures to reduce threats to public health stemming from drinking water; and strengthen local/Oblast
institutions for drinking water management.
4.26         The MEPNR will delegate responsibility for day-to-day technical and administrative
functions for implementation of the regional Water Quality and Water Resource Management
Subcomponents to a Subcomponent Management Committee (SCMC) and a Subcomponent Program
Manager (SCPM). The activities of the SCMC and SCPM will be supported in the following areas
by the CPPI (Annex 7.4) liaison; procurement; disbursement; reporting, accounting, and auditing;
information exchange; and related policies and procedures.
4.27         The SCPM will hire a team of experienced Russian technical personnel (with the
number varying depending on the size and complexity of the program) and administrative and support
personnel to form a Subcomponent Implementation Team (SIT). The SITs will be assisted by local
and foreign experts, hired according to Bank procurement procedures. An overall period of four years
is assumed for the implementation of the Water Quality and Water Resources Management
Component, divided into two phases as outlined below.
4.28         Phase I - Start-up Activities Activities during this initial Phase will establish the
institutional framework for implementation of the Water Quality and Resources Management
Component at the regional level. The EMP loan would finance the establishment and staffing of the
SCPM, provide the specialized training needed by the SCPMs, and the staff of the SITs. The
General Consultant Firm will assist the CPPI in this work. Activities will include:
*     build a national level program team including the SCPMs, staff of the MEPNR, CPPI,
and other key agencies; develop a common concept of the purpose, approach and aims
of the project, establish milestones and specifics goals, and develop regular
mechanisms for communication and coordination;
*     provide training to the SCPMs in CPPI policies and procedures, project management,
work planning and preparation of tender documents for consulting services; develop
mechanisms and approaches for effective working relationships with the CPPI,
donors, and other government agencies at the federal and regional levels;
*     establish the regional SIT Offices including the recruitment of staff, procurement of
equipment, and provide training for SIT staff;
*     build a regional level project team consisting of the SCPM, SIT, as well as Russian
and Foreign experts.
4.29         Phase I(b) - Inception and Work Planning. Activities during this phase, which
follows immediately on the subcomponent team building workshop, would develop a detailed work
plan and plan of implementation for each subcomponent project. Analysis and planning would focus
on sources, availability of data, methodologies, detailed discussion of expected outputs and results
and their relation to the objectives. The work plan includes the description, sequencing, and



The Project                                                                        43
scheduling of work tasks, data requirements, and analytical methods in sufficient detail to prepare the
contractors' TORs and monitor progress of the work. The implementation plan would include a
determination of all inputs required to complete the subcomponent project including contracts to
provide local and foreign technical assistance, equipment, etc. Local technical resources to be used
to implement the pilot project would be identified and evaluated. The implementation plan would
include a schedule of subcontracts and all required Terms of Reference.
4.30         Phase II- Implementation of Subcomponents (3.5years). This phase would consist
of the implementation of each of the subcomponents. The component would provide consultants (local
and foreign) to assist the SCPM and SITs to carry out studies, surveys, and analysis; equipment;
training including workshops and study tours; and demonstration projects and activities.
4.31         Phase II- Federal Program of Outreach and Coordination (3.5 years). This phase
of the project would develop a mechanism to network the various subcomponent projects to insure the
exchange of experience between team working on the same type of pilot project, and a mechanism
such as a annual or semi-annual seminar or workshop to link subcomponent project teams to oblasts
and municipalities that are not participating in the project.  It would run in parallel with the
implementation of each regional subcomponent.
3     Core Elements of the Hazardous Waste Management Component (US$9.8 million)
4.32         MEPNR officials are convinced that abatement and remediation of waste problems in
the Russian Federation cannot proceed successfully without specific hazardous waste legislation along
with a strengthened institutional system for managing hazardous waste according to well-established
"cradle-to-grave" principles. In December 1992, the MEPNR completed a Concept Paper for a major
program entitled simply "Waste. " The Waste program proposes a comprehensive, integrated approach
that will involve all relevant legislative and executive bodies at the federal, regional and local levels.
The program has three strategic objectives: (1) reducing waste production; (2) increasing waste
utilization; and (3) creating ecologically safe waste storage and burial.
4.33         The predominant method of hazardous and industrial waste management in the Russian
Federation is large scale land disposal using unlined lagoons and landfills. Discharge into liquid
industrial wastewater, either directly or through municipal sewers, is also a widespread practice. Few
formal treatment, resource recovery, or waste minimization techniques are applied. There is
widespread illegal and indiscriminate dumping of industrial waste. Waste streams are typically
intermixed, further complicating treatment and disposal. Scarcity of land is putting pressure on
enterprises to find other-than-land disposal methods. Concern for surface water quality and potential
contamination of primary domestic and industrial water supplies is rising.
4.34         Proposed Activities Two subcomponent projects have been identified for World Bank
funding from the hazardous waste component of the Environmental Framework Program: (i)
development of a national industrial waste management data management system (see Annex 3.4.1);
and (ii) development and demonstration of a regulatory management system for hazardous waste
control at the regional level (see Annex 3.4.2). These two core subcomponent projects represent the
development of basic tools required for the implementation of an effective response to the hazardous
waste problem. They have been specifically requested by MEPNR, as being both required and
supportive of current initiatives within the Ministry and its associated agencies at the regional level.
In addition, they offer the opportunity to introduce world wide experience in the field, such that the
country can attain harmonization with international standards and conventions such as the Basel
Convention. The need for these basic tools is also recognized as a prerequisite to being able to
identify, select and justify capital investments in hazardous waste management infrastructure, such as



44                                                         Environmental Management Project
may qualify for domestic and international financing in the future.
4.35          Development of a National Industrial Waste Data Management System. The purpose
of this subcomponent is to develop a comprehensive capability to collect, classify, document, analyze
and report data related to the nature, quantity and disposition of industrial and particularly hazardous
waste generated within the Russian Federation on an ongoing basis. More specifically, the project is
intended to put in place an operational data management and information system which can:
*     provide a uniform national system of waste classification, consistent with international
conventions;
*     aggregate and evaluate waste generation information collected at the enterprise,
regional and national levels as a function of type, industrial sector and region;
*     predict waste generation trends;
*     facilitate the analysis of waste management issues for purposes of legislative and
regulatory action; and
-     allow coordinated planning of improved waste management infrastructure.
4.36          Three defined parts have been identified for the project to be undertaken over a three
year period:  (i)  rapid assessment of existing data; (ii) system design, development and data
verification; and (iii) data evaluation and system implementation.  The first part, targeted for
completion by the end of Year 1, will provide a consolidation of existing national waste information,
a revised national waste classification system consistent with international conventions, and a
preliminary assessment of the data for policy purposes. This will make available an initial information
base for immediate policy planning, as well as providing a basis for subsequent data management
system design. During the second year, Part 2 will be undertaken and encompass the design and
testing of an automated data management system, inclusive of the capability to efficiently collect data
being obtained by regional environment committees as part of mandatory reporting requirements
currently in place. Part 3 will extend over the three year period and involve development of data
analysis capability, specifically directed to its utilization in the planning of waste management
infrastructure, as well as the transfer of the system to MEPNR for ongoing use.
4.37          At the end of the three year period, it is anticipated that the above data management
capability will be operational within MEPNR as a continuing service capability for the development
of improved national policies for the sound management of industrial wastes through an enhanced
ability to prioritize waste management problems and direct resources to their solution.
4.38          The coordinating agency for this subcomponent project will be MEPNR  and
specifically the Hazardous Waste Management Component Management Committee (HWMMC). The
Project Implementation Manual contains the framework agreement outlining the implementation
arrangements for this subcomponent). The HWMMC has been formed to provide overall supervision
of the Hazardous Waste Management Component and, under the Chairmanship of MEPNR, has
representation from:  national industrial committees and ministries; State Institute for Statistics;
Ministry of Economy; and Participating Oblast Environmental Committees.   The project's
implementing team will be located in the Institute of Economic Problems of Nature Management
(IEPNM), which operates as a supporting organization to the MEPNR and which will report to the
HWMMC. The project will be organized under the direction of a Subcomponent Project Manager,
reporting to IEPNM, and responsible for direction of all local and foreign technical resources



The Project                                                                        45
assembled for the project's implementation, and for support resources dedicated to, or contracted by
the project. Under the Subcomponent Project Manger, the Project will be organized in accordance
with its functional parts, namely: Rapid Assessment of Existing Data; System Design, Development
and Data Verification; and Data Evaluation and System Implementation. Each functional part
identified above will be directed by a Task Manager, reporting to the Subcomponent Project Manager,
and who will be responsible for technical and support resources dedicated to the specific part's
implementation. Foreign technical advisors will be assigned to each of the specific parts of the project
under a single contract.
4.39         Development and Demonstration of Regulatory Management Capability for the
Control of Hazardous Waste at the Regional Level The purpose of this subcomponent project is to
develop and demonstrate the basic elements of a functional regulatory capability, necessary to control
the generation and management of hazardous waste at a regional level for emulation elsewhere in the
country. More specifically, it is intended to develop and put in p!ace the necessary tools in the form
of regulations, practices, procedures, and support infrastructure, which can effectively:
*     characterize and classify hazardous wastes for regulatory control purposes;
*     track hazardous wastes from their source of generation to point of disposal;
*     control the management practices applied to them throughout their life cycle; and
*     provide sufficient measurement capability to adequately support the above regulatory
system.
4.40         The functional products of this subcomponent will be the fundamental regulatory
system constituents commonly identified as necessary to effectively control hazardous waste generation
and disposition, namely:
*     detailed hazardous waste classification;
*     hazardous waste generator identification;
*     hazardous waste movement tracking;
*     hazardous waste management facility approval system; and
*     contingency event response planning.
4.41         Each of these will consist of a number of elements, including formal enforceable
regulations, implementation procedures, communication and consultation practice on their
implementation, and training for both regulatory officials and those to whom the system is applied.
The ability to evaluate waste streams analytically is recognized as a basic technical support
requirement and provision for upgrading of laboratory capability is also included in the subcomponent
project's scope.
4.42         Two Oblasts, namely Yaroslavl and Vologda in the Upper Volga region have been
selected for this subcomponent. They have agreed that the Subcomponent Implementation Team will
be located in Yaroslav and will be under the direction of an Inter-regional Environmental Council.
The Project Implementation Manual contains the framework agreement outlining the implementation
arrangement for this component. A high level of commitment and cooperation has been exhibited by

the regional and local environment committees, particularly within the major industrial centers of
Yaroslavl and Cherepovetz. Local administrations and elected councils appear willing to take the
necessary action to support a regional regulatory control system. The area offers a wide distribution
of representative industry which will be characteristic of their respective industrial sectors. Significant
industrial and hazardous waste problems have already been identified in the area, some of which are
considered critical in environmental impact terms, particularly in relation to the Volga River and
Ribinsk Reservoir. Finally, several other EMP components which will be complimentary are slated
for implementation in the Region. These include three potential waste related environmental studies
identified as donor funded technical assistance opportunities as part of the Hazardous Waste component
(Cherepovetz Steel Mill, Yaroslavl Paint and Refinery enterprises). A subcomponent of the Water
Quality Management component will be implemented in the Upper Volga Region. A regional
subcomponent project has been identified for Cherepovetz as part of the Environmental Epidemiology
subcomponent.  Finally, the project will be supported with legal resources by the Policy and
Regulatory Support Component.
4.43          The subcomponent project will be undertaken over a four year period with the waste
classification, generator identification and waste movement tracking activities being given priority in
the first two years and the facility licensing and contingency event planning activities being completed
in the latter two years. Two existing regional environmental committee laboratories, one in a major
industrial center in each Oblast, will be upgraded in terms of equipment, operating practice and
environmental monitoring capability.
4.44          A Regional Hazardous Waste Regulatory Project Management Committee will be
established under the auspices of the Inter-Oblast Upper Volga Environmental Council and report to
the overall EMP Hazardous Waste Management Component Management Committee (HWMMC)
established within the MEPNR. Chairmanship of the Committee will be shared on a rotating basis
by the Oblast Environmental Committee Chairman from Vologda and Yaroslavl, or their delegates.
Membership on the Committee shall include but not be limited to representatives of: Oblast
Administrations; Cherepovetz and other City Environmental Committees; Ministry of Environmental
Protection and Natural Resources; Major Regional Industries; Environmental Organization
Representatives; and Regional Technical Institutes.
4.45          This subcomponent project will be organized under the direction of a Subcomponent
Project Manager, reporting to the Committee and be responsible for direction of all local and foreign
technical resources assembled for the Project's implementation, and for support resources dedicated
or contracted to the Project. Under the Project Manger, a Subcomponent Implementation Team will
be organized in accordance with its functional parts, namely:  Waste Classification; Waste
Management Facility Standards; Waste Tracking System; and Measurement Capability.  Each
functional part identified above will be directed by a Task Manager, reporting to the Project Manager,
and who shall be responsible for technical resources dedicated to the specific parts's implementation.
Foreign technical advisors will be assigned to specific parts with an additional senior foreign technical
advisor assigned to assist the Subcomponent Project Manager with both technical and project
management matters and coordinate the activities of other foreign technical advisors assigned to
specific parts of the Project.
4.46          The Project will be headquartered and based in Yaroslavl in office space to be supplied
by the Oblast administration. Specific project tasks may be based at other locations in the region as
determined by mutual agreement among the parties, considering the practicality of effectively
undertaking the specific work requirements at that location, and the availability of suitable office and
living accommodation for project staff and technical advisors during project assignments, as well as
the effective management and organization of the project. Laboratory facilities selected for upgrading



The Project                                                                             47
will be those currently operated by the oblast and/or city environmental committees at one location
in each of Vologda and Yaroslavl Oblasts. Final selection of the upgraded laboratory locations will
be a specific task of the measurement capability part of the project, giving consideration to existing
capability and resources, and proximity to major regulated enterprises and waste management
facilities.
4. National Pollution Abatement Facility (US$137 million)
4.47          Introduction.  During the central planning period, substantially higher levels of
emissions were tolerated in the Soviet Union than were allowed in the rest of Europe. In addition,
central planning distorted domestic energy and natural resource prices, with the result that there was
no incentive to recover valuable natural resources emitted into the environment. The legacy of these
policies is severe environmental degradation, as well as a capital stock that is inefficient, highly energy
intensive, and pollutes not just the Russian Federation but other parts of the world.
4.48          The failure to invest in resource recovery projects has resulted in a plethora of "win-
win" investment opportunities in which investors can earn a satisfactory rate of return and reduce
noxious pollutants by capturing commercially valuable commodities currently being emitted into the
environment. Such projects are characterized by raw material inputs which have zero or negative
costs and outputs which can be exported. These resource recovery/pollution abatement investments
will not only improve the environment, but will also assist the GOR to implement an economic
transition program.  However, mobilizing funds to invest in such resource recovery/pollution
abatement projects presents major challenges due to various uncertainties, including (i) the difficulty
in encouraging inward investment; (ii) political uncertainties; (iii) lack of project preparation and
financing capabilities; and (iv) unwillingness of both local and foreign banks to provide the medium
to long term loans needed to finance these investments.
4.49          The GOR has recognized that at this critical time in the development of new economic,
political, and social structures, Bank funds can play an essential role by providing: (i) a direct source
of funds which would not otherwise be available; (ii) comfort to other foreign investors by virtue of
their ability to associate their money with Bank funds; and (iii) access to a stock of well-prepared
resource recovery projects with significant environmental external benefits.
4.50          The investments required by these resource recovery/pollution abatement projects are
generally too small and the number of individual projects too large for the Bank to lend to directly.
Consequently, an effective and efficient mechanism needs to be developed which will receive funds
from the Bank and other donors and on-lend them to individual sub-projects.
4.51          To this end, GOR is in the process of establishing a National Pollution Abatement
Facility (NPAF) initially financed from the Bank loan. The NPAF would help to finance a portion of
the investment costs of commercially viable resource recovery/pollution abatement projects with an
identifiable and secure stream of either foreign exchange or ruble denominated earnings that could be
used to repay NPAF loans as well as loans from other lenders. It would be authorized to lend to state
owned enterprises, local or foreign private entities, and joint ventures.
4.52          In addition, to the extent possible, the NPAF would be authorized to syndicate or sell
all or part of its existing loans to local commercial banks on a non-recourse basis, thereby reducing
the Government's exposure to commercial risk and enabling the NPAF to maximize its catalytic
impact and revolve its resources more rapidly. The proceeds of all loan sales will be redeposited in
the NPAF and will be available to finance additional sub-loans. Special efforts will be made to alert
local commercial banks to the lending opportunities associated with NPAF projects. In the event that



48                                                            Environmental Management Project
local commercials banks are interested in financing a large percentage of the total project cost, the
NPAF will step aside and provide only the minimum necessary financial support. The NPAF will not
finance projects whose expected rate of return would indicate that they could pay the interest rates
expected to be charged under the World Bank-supported Enterprise Support Project (ESP), provided
that the project meets the other eligibility criteria for ESP financing and commercial banks are willing
to provide the necessary term financing.2'
4.53          The NPAF will also provide an institutional framework for the GEF, ODS Phase Out
Program, and various multilateral and bilateral agencies to channel their resources to well-prepared,
carefully appraised environment projects in the Russian Federation, including projects developed under
the auspices of the Baltic Initiative and the European Community's carbon tax initiative. Support for
these additional projects could take the form of loans, grants, and debt for environment swaps,
depending on the requirements of the project and the preference of the donor. Financial resources
provided under the auspices of these programs would be processed by the NPAF's existing cadre of
core consultants, although the actual resources to support these sub-projects would be independent of
the NPAF's main activities supported by this loan.
4.54          NPAF Design and Operating Procedures. Organizational arrangements for the NPAF
are shown in Figure 4.1. A core NPAF consultant team will be established under the Center for
Project Preparation and Implementation (CPPI) to manage the appraisal and supervision of investment
projects. This team will also be assisted by technical and legal consultants as required. An NPAF
Supervisory Board (Supervisory Board) will also be established, consisting of high level government
officials, to review and approve sub-project investment proposals and to decide policy matters relating
to the operation of the NPAF. Organization of the CPPI is discussed below (paras. 4.81-4.86).
4.55          The NPAF will be established pursuant to a formal resolution of the Government
which will indicate, inter alia, that (i) the CPPI, assisted by NPAF consultants, will provide
professional services related to the selection, design, appraisal, and supervision of investment projects,
on the basis of specific criteria and procedures outlined in the Operating Instructions; (ii) the NPAF
Supervisory Board consisting of high level representatives of appropriate ministries and agencies of
the Borrower will review and approve investment projects proposed by the CPPI; and (iii) the MOF,
as the sub-loan lender of record, will take decisions related to investment projects considered and
approved by the NPAF Supervisory Board and will enter into appropriate sub-loan agreements. The
MOF will not allocate loan funds to sub-projects that have not passed through the above approval
process. In addition to codifying the organizational arrangements of the NPAF, the Government
resolution will ensure that the NPAF will not be subject to Russian taxation, including VAT and
income and/or profit tax on interest income, nor will it be subject to banking regulations. Finally,
the resolution will stipulate that the NPAF will have the right to analyze proposed environmental
projects, prepare the necessary documentation, perfect security, hire consultants to assist with project
appraisal and other NPAF business, and make recommendations to the NPAF Supervisory Board.
During negotiations, agreement was reached that the adoption by the Borrower of a resolution
and other actions, acceptable to the Bank, necessary to implement the NPAF component, will
be a condition of loan effectiveness. In addition, it was agreed that the Borrower would adopt
legal and regulatory decisions to enable NPAF sub-loans and IPPA to be onlent to sub-borrowers.
8/ The purpose of the ESP is to help put in place an integrated framework for assistance to privatized and new private enterprises including
debt, and equity financing, as well as technical assistance.
2/ At the project screening stage, any projects which would appear to meet ESP requirements will be offered to three ERP participating
banks. If no offer of finance is received in a reasonable time, the NPAF would continue to process the project according to its own
procedures.



The Project                                                                          49
4.56          The MOF will establish a dedicated NPAF revolving account (NPAF Account) into
which all debt service payments of sub-loans (interest, principal and other charges) will be deposited.
Sub-loan principal repayments will be used to fund additional sub-loans and will not be used to
amortize the Bank loan used to fund the NPAF. This will help ensure the sustainability of the NPAF
to finance pollution abatement projects. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the
proceeds from the NPAF Account will be used as follows: (i) to pay the interest on the portion
of the Bank loan used to fund the NPAF; (ii) to pay the operating expenses of the NPAF; and
(iii) of the remaining balance after deducting these charges, 30% will be transferred to the MOF
and 70% will be used to fund additional NPAF sub-loans. It was also agreed that as a condition
of disbursement for NPAF sub-loans and Investment Project Preparation Advances (IPPA), the
Borrower would enter into an arrangement with a bank to manage the NPAF Account who terms
and conditions are satisfactory to the Bank.
4.57         Operating Instructions would provide guidance to the NPAF consultants on detailed
operating procedures, including such matters, inter alia, as: (i) project eligibility criteria; (ii) project
approval and appraisal criteria, including the Bank's right to prior approval; (iii) staff responsibilities;
(iv) eligibility criteria for receiving assistance for project preparation from the Investment Project
Preparation Advance Facility (see para. 4.66); (v) cofinancing procedures; (vi) procurement
modalities; (vii) auditing and reporting requirements; (viii) the general terms and conditions of NPAF
sub-loans; and (ix) environmental guidelines and procedures. During negotiations, it was agreed that
adoption by the Borrower of Operating Instructions for the NPAF, satisfactory to the Bank, will
be a condition of loan disbursement for the NPAF component. In addition, it was agreed that
the Borrower would ensure that NPAF would operate pursuant to the Operating Instructions
satisfactory to the Bank.
4.58         Management and Staffing.  A small professional cadre of NPAF consultants,
including expert consultants with international project finance experience, would be retained by the
CPPI to manage the NPAF's activities, including project preparation and appraisal. The cadre of core
consultants would consist of: (i) a general manager; (ii) a chief financial officer and one professional
assistant who would be responsible for analyzing the financial merits of each proposed sub-project and
overseeing contract/project management and procurement matters; and (iii) a technical manager and
one professional assistant who would be responsible for evaluating and overseeing the technical
engineering and pollution abatement aspects of each proposed sub-loan. The staff would be authorized
to appraise projects and make recommendations to the Board only on the basis of a project's technical
and financial merits, in accordance with the rules and regulations specified in the Operating
Instructions. The General Manager would be expected to submit periodic audited financial statements
and activity reports to the Bank, other cofinanciers, and appropriate GOR authorities.  The
composition of the core consultant team as well as the duties of each team member were agreed
during negotiations. It was also agreed that the hiring of the core team of consultants for the
NPAF will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
4.59         To facilitate its operations, the CPPI would contract with: (i) legal consultants to
prepare draft loan agreements and handle other legal matters; and (ii) technical consultants to help the
core staff appraise the technical engineering and environmental aspects of proposed sub-loans.
4.60         Sub-Project Appraisal and Sub-Loan Approval Procedures. The NPAF will not
finance the installation of additional production equipment, or the expansion of existing production
facilities, but will focus instead on environmental clean-up sub-projects designed to capture
commercially valuable emissions from existing production facilities. Typical project concepts that
would likely qualify for NPAF financing are included in Annex 4.2. These include: (i) the collection
of dust containing high concentrations of copper and other toxic metals, and the recovery of copper



50                                                               Environmental Management Project
for export; (ii) collection and recovery of toxic/flammable hydrocarbon vapors from oil tank farms;
(iii) recovery of a copper concentrate from waste tailings; (iv) oil spill recovery; and (v) recovery of
metals from metal finishing wastes. A pipeline of sub-projects is currently being identified by
consultants who are working on the setting up of the NPAF.
4.61           The NPAF will finance only those sub-projects that have been prepared on the basis
of a comprehensive feasibility study prepared by the sponsors and subjected to a rigorous screening
and appraisal process by the core consultants and technical expert consultants hired from time to time
to assist with specific appraisal issues. A detailed diagram illustrating the sub-project approval cycle
is presented in Annex 4.4. Sub-project sponsors would be expected to submit a feasibility study
carried out in accordance with NPAF guidelines approved by the Bank. The study would indicate,
inter alia,: (i) project design; (ii) equipment specifications; (iii) engineering cost estimates; (iv)
implementation arrangements; (v) the proposed financing plan; (vi) detailed financial projections with
appropriate sensitivity analyses; (vii) the proposed legal structure of the borrowing entity; and (viii)
an environmental impact assessment.
4.62           During the appraisal of the feasibility study, the core consultants will review and
assess the sub-project's financial, environmental, legal and technical aspects.
i      The financial portion of the appraisal will, inter alia, (i) confirm the financial viability
of the proposed project; (ii) assess the portfolio risk posed by the project; (iii) ensure
that the proposed loan maturity is consistent with the projected pay-back period; and
(iv) examine the proposed cofinancing arrangements, including sponsors' equity,
export credits, and internal cash generation; (v) determine if the enterprise will be
able to repay its loan even in a period of high domestic inflation; and (vi) determine
whether the project might be eligible for financing under the ERP.
*      The legal portion of the appraisal will, inter alia, (i) confirm the legal status of the
borrowing entity; (ii) ensure that the legal entity is licensed to borrow and repay
foreign exchange; and (iii) examine the proposed security arrangements.
*      The technical portion of the proposed appraisal will, inter alia, (i) confirm that the
project is technically feasible, cost effective, and that no experimental technologies are
being applied; (ii) confirm that the benefits are achievable; (iii) establish that the
timescales are reasonable; and (iv) confirm that the procurement approach is
acceptable.
*      The environmental portion of the appraisal will, inter alia, (i) ensure that the project
has a beneficial impact on the quality of the natural environment compared with
existing baseline conditions; (ii) confirm that the project complies with prevailing rules
and regulations regarding emissions standards; (iii) determine that the proposed project
is consistent with the NPAF priority pollution abatement criteria; and (iv) ensure that
the project complies with existing Russian EA regulations and meets the Bank's EA
requirements.
4.63           In determining whether the sub-project meets the NPAF's pollution abatement criteria,
NPAF managers will evaluate such considerations as: (i) the location of the sub-project with respect
to population centers, sensitive local land uses including schools and hospitals, and the existing levels
and sources of pollution; (ii) the pollution category (air, surface water, groundwater, hazardous waste,
etc.); (iii) the scale of the pollution impact, including whether there are potential trans-boundary
effects, or only local or regional impacts; and (iv) the effects associated with the pollution, including



The Project                                                                        51
possible toxicity to human health, possible impact on climate change, and damage to natural
ecosystems and habitat; and (v) the environmental benefits of the sub-project under consideration
compared with the environmental benefits expected to accrue from other sub-projects currently in the
project pipeline or under appraisal. Draft feasibility study guidelines, sub-loan appraisal criteria,
environmental priority criteria, and Supervisory Board approval procedures were agreed during
negotiations and will be incorporated in the NPAF Operating Instructions.
4.64         If the appraisal indicates that the proposed sub-project satisfies the NPAF's
environmental, legal, financial, and technical criteria, the core consultants will recommend that the
Supervisory Board approve the sub-loan. Prior to consideration by the NPAF Supervisory Board, the
Advisory Panel for the Federal Environmental Policy Unit will advise the MEPNR as to whether a
proposed loan has acceptable environmental benefits and conforms to the NPAF's environmental
priorities. Their recommendation will constitute part of the official record of each sub-loan, but the
NPAF Supervisory Board will not be bound by these recommendations when deciding whether to
approve a particular sub-loan. Investment sub-projects approved by the NPAF Supervisory Board will
be submitted to the MOF, which will make a decision on sub-loan financing. NPAF core consultants
will monitor procurement and disbursement matters, supervise the sub-borrowers, and ensure that all
reporting and auditing requirements are fulfilled. During negotiations, agreement was reached with
the Borrower that, prior to the disbursement of Bank loan for NPAF sub-loans, it would ensure
that each NPAF sub-loan has been approved in accordance with the requirements agreed with
the Bank, including procedures, eligibility criteria, and terms and conditions for sub-loans.
4.65         Prior Bank Review. Until the Bank loan for the NPAF is fully disbursed, the Bank
will have two opportunities to review proposed sub-loans. First, the Bank will receive a summary of
all projects that have passed the initial screening review conducted by the NPAF consultants. Second,
before sub-loans are presented to the NPAF Supervisory Board, the Bank will have an opportunity to
review the project documents and indicate whether the NPAF should finance the proposed project.
If the Bank believes that the project should not receive a loan from the NPAF, the project would not
be presented to the Supervisory Board. Conversely, the Supervisory Board of Directors would not
be obliged to approve a project merely because the Bank have not expressed its objections. Details
of the Bank's prior review and approval responsibilities were agreed during negotiations.
4.66         Facility for Investment Project Preparation Advances. An IPPA Facility will be set
up with an initial funding of $5 million under the Bank loan. Donors have also expressed interest in
providing grant funds for investment project preparation and identification. Such funds, if available,
will be used prior to the drawdown of the Bank loan for this purpose.
4.67         A sub-borrower seeking an IPPA for a NPAF sub-loan will submit to the NPAF a
proposal, together with an application and a summary of the proposed sub-project. If the NPAF
management determines that the proposal for the IPPA meets the technical, environmental, financial,
and legal criteria, the proposal will be sent to the Bank, together with the initial review summary for
the proposed sub-project. Following the Bank's review and no-objection, and the NPAF Supervisory
Board or its appointee approval, the MOF will, based on the determination of the NPAF Supervisory
Board, make the final decision whether or not to approve the IPPA.  Each IPPA will: (i) be
denominated and be repayable (principle and interest) in US dollars; (ii) carry an interest rate
satisfactory to the Bank; (iii) be no more than $300,000; and (iv) contribute no more than eighty
percent of the total cost of preparation work and feasibility studies related to the proposed sub-project.
During negotiations, agreement was reached that prior to disbursing loan funds for IPPA, the
Borrower would ensure that each IPPA has been approved in accordance with the requirements
agreed with the Bank, including procedures, eligibility criteria, and terms and conditions for
advances.



52                                                          Environmental Management Project
4.68          Potential Cofinancing Arrangements. The NPAF has been designed to support two
distinct cofinancing arrangements. First, in order to reduce the NPAF's cost of funds and also to help
the NPAF obtain additional lending resources, bilateral and multilateral agencies have been asked to
help fund the NPAF with either grants or low interest loans. At a Donors Meeting on April 13, 1994,
the Swiss Government indicated its interest in providing SFI0 million of grant funds to capitalize the
NPAF.
4.69          In addition to capitalizing the NPAF, individual donors, export credit agencies, and
private lenders and investors could also cofinance specific sub-projects. Disbursement, procurement,
and reporting rules and procedures for this cofinancing modality will also be specified in advance. The
Bank is continuing to explore the possibility of mobilizing cofinancing via both modalities. The
federal, regional, and local environmental funds are also potential cofinancing sources for local costs.
4.70          On-lending Terms. Sub-loans from the NPAF will be denominated in US dollars.
Sub-borrowers will bear the US dollar exchange risk. The interest rate on NPAF loans would be
fixed for the life of the sub-loans. For the start-up phase of the NPAF, it has been agreed that the
on-lending rate would be equal to the World Bank lending rate in effect during the semester in which
the sub-loan'L' is approved plus a spread of approximately 400 basis points. In case of excess demand
for NPAF financing, rationing will be on the basis of environmental benefits. The minimum sub-loan
size will be $350,000 and the maximum sub-loan size will be $7,000,000. In order to ensure that
smaller enterprises have an opportunity to apply for and receive financing from the NPAF, efforts will
be made to publicize the existence of the NPAF within Russia. The availability of IPPAs should
enable small and medium enterprises to prepare projects for consideration by the NPAF. The NPAF
will finance no more than 70% of the total project cost and project sponsors will be expected to
finance at least 20% of the total project cost with equity. Where a proposed project has no existing
revenue stream, the NPAF will finance interest during construction, provided that the total loan
including interest during construction does not exceed the maximum loan size and financing percentage
specified above. The maximum loan term, including any grace period on principal repayments during
construction, will generally be eight years, including up to three years of grace.
4.71          In addition to the terms and conditions specified above, commercial projects will pay
an up-front appraisal fee equal to 1 % of the sub-loan amount, which can be financed from the sub-loan
proceeds, and a sub-loan supervision fee equal to 0.25% for the first five years and 0.125% for all
subsequent years.
4.72          Based on the assumptions detailed in Annex 4.1, the NPAF's forecast income
statement for the 17 year life of the Bank loan is summarized below in Table 4.1. The forecast
interest income amounts to $84 million over the 17 year period. Additional income via appraisal and
supervisory fees of $5.2 million should also be generated, bringing the NPAF's gross income during
the seven year period to $89.5 million. Interest and commitment fees on the portion of the Bank loan
used to fund the NPAF are projected at about $31 million over the 17 year period and operating
expenses would an additional $24 million over this period, comprised of operating losses of $1.5
million during the initial two year start-up phase and operating profits of $36 million during the latter
15 years. As agreed during negotiations, 30% of these operating profits will be transferred to the
Ministry of Finance; the remaining 70% will remain in the NPAF and be available to fund additional
sub-loans on the same terms and conditions. Interest on these reinvested earnings would boost the
NPAF's interest revenues by approximately $21 million over the 17 year period. Table A4.1 in
IO/This will be between the rate at which ESP funds are onlent to the commercial banks (i.e., 250 basis points above the weighted average
of EBRD and IBRD lending rates, for a cost of funds to the banks of approximately 9%) and the on-lending rate to their borrowers. The
commercial banks are expected to charge their borrowers between 14 and 15%.



The Project                                                                        53
Annex 4.1 indicates that the expected disbursement rate used in the financial projections is expected
to be close to the IBRD standard profiles for lines of credit.
4.73         Expected additional tax revenues. Commercially viable pollution abatement projects
financed by the NPAF will not only be able to repay the principal and interest on their NPAF loans,
but also will generate additional tax revenues for the Government. Depending on the extent of
cofinancing with other lenders, the amount of additional taxes generated during the life of the Bank
loan could be substantial and in excess of the amount of the loan borrowed from the Bank. An
example of such projects is included in Annex 4.3, in which a copper dust recovery project is analyzed
on the basis of a preliminary feasibility study results. This shows that for an investment of US$8
million (for which the NPAF may lend between US$2-4 million for procurement of foreign equipment
and technology), yearly tax revenues may be of the order of $2 million. Therefore, over the expected
10-15 year life of the project, some US$20-30 million of additional tax revenues would be generated
by this one project alone.

5.     Center for Project Preparation and Implementation (US$5.5 million)
4.74         The CPPI has already been established as a separate non-commercial legal entity under
the MEPNR, which is responsible for appointing the CPPI's Board of Directors. An initial
organizational arrangement for the CPPI is presented in Annex 7.1. Both the Director and Deputy
Director have been hired using funds from the Project Preparation Facility advance for the project.
The principal role of the CPPI will be to facilitate the implementation of the Bank financed
components of the EFP, as well as GEF funded Project Preparation Advances and other projects
following Bank procurement, disbursement, accounting, auditing and reporting procedures and
requirements. Other important roles of the CPPI will be to: (i) provide overall project management
and coordination; (ii) disseminate information regarding Bank and donor financed EFP components;
(iii) liaise with other funding agencies; and (iv) facilitate training activities under the project. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that CPPI would maintain functions, staffimg, including
consultants, and other resources satisfactory to the Bank.
4.75          During the start up phase of the project, the CPPI will be assisted by a project
Management Advisory firm familiar with Bank procurement and disbursement procedures. The
Project Management Advisory firm will assist the CPPI in setting up and with the daily operation of:
financial and accounting systems; information and donor coordination system; procurement procedures
and systems; contracting management; and for the training of CPPI staff in the operation of these
systems. The services of this firm will be retained as long as it is needed for the efficient management
and operation of the CPPI. As shown in Annex 7.1 and 7.2, the procurement and disbursement
functions fall under the responsibility of the Deputy Director, who has already received Bank training
in these procedures. During the start-up phase, the CPPI will consist of six full time personnel,
increasing to eleven during implementation. The CPPI will be responsible for contracting all advisers
and experts at national and regional levels - both individuals and firms. The subcomponent
implementation team to which the adviser or expert is attached will be responsible for their selection
and technical activities, but contract administration will be by the CPPI. It will also be responsible
for equipment procurement in accordance with World Bank guidelines.
4.76         The CPPI also will be assisted by a General Consultant Firm (GCF), which will assist
and train subcomponent project managers during the start-up phase of the project, and will assist the
CPPI with project supervision and project performance and progress evaluation during implementation.
During the start-up phase, the GCF will assist the subcomponent project managers with the following:
finalizing subcomponent scopes of work; work plans and schedules; budgets; consultant terms of
references; terms of reference for members of subcomponent implementation teams; integration and
coordination of project subcomponents; providing project management training; and developing project
progress benchmarks for future evaluation. During the implementation phase, the GCF will carry out
independent tri-yearly reviews of project performance and progress against the development objectives
and schedules developed during appraisal and refined during the start-up phase. The Terms of
Reference for the General Consultant Firm is given in the Project Implementation Manual.
4.77         The CPPI will be responsible for all the project's financial aspects, including opening
and managing a Special Account, contract administration, contract payments, facilitating Letters of
Credit, arranging for international financing agency disbursements, setting up and managing accounts
and arranging for audits, as and when required. The CPPI will also be responsible for the Project
Completion Reports which will be required by the international financing agencies. Details of the
CPPI's activities in relation to project implementation are given in Section D below.



The Project                                                                                    57
C. Project Cost and Financing Plan
4.78           The estimated cost of the project is summarized in Table 4.3. The total cost of the
project is estimated at $194.8 million equivalent (including taxes and duties totalling about $3 million
equivalent), with a foreign exchange component of $91.9 million, or 47 percent of the total project
cost. A detailed breakdown of the cost estimates for the different components of the project is given
in Tables A.5.1 and A.5.2 of Annex 5.
4.79           As shown in Table 4.4, the Bank loan would finance $110 million, or 56 percent of
the total project cost. It would cover 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures and 17 percent
of the estimated local costs ($18.1 million equivalent). The local costs that will be financed by the
Bank loan include non-recurrent incremental costs and recurrent incremental costs on a declining basis:
100 percent for expenditures incurred up to November 30, 1997 and 50 percent thereafter. Local
costs include hiring of local experts and institutes, subcomponent project managers, staff for
subcomponent implementation teams, and local expert advisors to these teams. Once the Project has
terminated, some of these teams will continue to function as newly created divisions in their
sponsoring comnmittees or ministries, which have agreed to provide for their continuing financial
support. Other teams, such as the CPPI, will be disbanded, or may spin-off as independent
consultants, as have been the case in other East European countries. The federal and regional agencies
responsible for overseeing project subcomponents will provide office and other facilities for these
teams at no cost to the project. However, these costs have been factored into the Government
contribution as "in-kind"L'' expenses.
4.80           The full financing plan for this project includes funding from the Government of
Russia (GOR) and local Russian commercial banks and enterprises of $84.8 million. These estimates
are based on a GOR contribution of $9.8 million as well as local cost financing for the projects
supported by the NPAF of $75 million, comprised of $25 million as equity contributions from
enterprises and $50 million financed by loans from banks or other sources to enterprises. The
Federal, Regional and Local Environment Funds that have been established as a result of the
introduction of a pollution fee collection system throughout the Russian Federation (see para 2.57)
could provide a part of the loan cofinancing of local costs in some instances. Enterprises may also
choose to finance their equity contributions through joint venture arrangements.
11/ In-kind expenses are estimated at $6.02 million over the expected life of the project, including: office space and facilities; staff of
government agencies (i.e., subcomponent management committees); laboratory and other support facilities; conference rooms, etc.

D.    Project Implementation
1.    Center for Project Preparation and Implementation
4.81         The Government has designated the MEPNR as the lead agency for the management
of the project and the coordination of its implementation. Because of the need to strengthen the project
preparation and implementation capacity of MEPNR, work began at an early stage of preparation of
the project with the setting up of the CPPI as a separate non-commercial legal entity governed by the
MEPNR. The Terms of Reference for the CPPI is provided in Annex 7.3. An advance from the
Bank's Project Preparation Facility was requested by the government to enable the early recruitment
and training of staff for this unit. The Charter of the CPPI is included in the Project Implementation
Manual.
4.82         Recruitment for CPPI has already begun and will take place in two phases as shown
in Annex 7.1 and Annex 7.2. In the first phase, the Director and Deputy Director of the CPPI have
been selected and a Project Management Advisory Firm has been hired using Bank consultant selection
procedures. Other CPPI staff are being hired as the work load increases. A draft copy of the CPPI
Director's contract and Terms of Reference for the Russian Project Management Advisory Firm are
contained in the Project Implementation Manual.
4.83         In the second phase, the remainder of the core CPPI management team would be
recruited, thereby increasing the staffing level to some 11 people, including support staff. This level
of staffing would be achieved by the time of loan effectiveness expected in December 1994.
4.84         As well as providing administrative support for the project as discussed above, the
Director of the CPPI is also designated as the overall project manager for EMP. As shown in the
organizational chart (Figure 4.2), the CPPI not only reports to the Minister (and the designated Deputy
Minister) of MEPNR, but also to a CPPI Supervisory Board made up of representative project
stakeholders from MEPNR and other Federal Government agencies. This is necessary because of the
distributed functions for environmental management across a number of government agencies.
4.85         Each TA subcomponent of EMP will be managed by a Russian subcomponent project
manager who reports to the CPPI Director, as well as to an EMP subcomponent management
committee made up of specific stakeholders relating to that subcomponent. Each subcomponent
project manager directs the work of a subcomponent implementation team of Russian experts. If the
subcomponent is being implemented at the regional level this team reports to a regional subcomponent
management committee, which is responsible for overall technical direction, coordination and
dissemination of the results to other regions.
4.86         A  framework agreement has been drawn up for each Subcomponent, and included
in the Project Implementation Manual, which spells out in detail the roles, responsibilities, and
commitments, as well as management and organizational arrangements that have been agreed between
the parties, which include MEPNR, CPPI and the federal and regional implementing agencies and
committees. These framework agreements will be formalized in the form of a binding legal agreement
among the parties.  Implementing resolutions of the parties to the subcomponent framework
agreements have been initialed by the relevant parties at federal and regional levels and a letter from
the Russian Government indicating that the resolutions will be adopted upon loan effectiveness has
been provided to the Bank.

2.    Project Implementation Schedule
4.87         Individual subcomponent implementation schedules are given in Annex 8. These
schedules indicate that the overall project is expected to be completed in approximately six years,
while some subcomponents may be completed within two to three years.  Since the Project
Management Advisory Firm has been hired and is setting up the procurement, financial and
information management systems in the CPPI, selection, contracting and recruitment of the General
Consultant Firm and the subcomponent project managers could be finalized by March 1995.
4.88         The General Consultant Firm could then begin the work of training and assisting the
Subcomponent Project Managers in initiating the project start-up activities prior to loan effectiveness
with a view to early selection and recruitment of consultants to assist the subcomponent project
implementation teams.
4.89         Prior to loan effectiveness, a Project Launch Workshop would be conducted with the
participation of the subcomponent project managers, the General Consultant Firm, the CPPI, MEPNR
and subcomponent management committee chairpersons, the Project Management Advisory Firmn and
the World Bank team. At this workshop, presentations and discussions would be held on procurement
and contracting processes and procedures, financial management matters, interlinking and coordination
of the technical aspects of the various subcomponents, supervision and reporting requirements, follow-
up workshops and seminars, links with the programs of other donors supporting the Environmental
Framework Program, etc. Follow-up coordination workshops including donor supported activities will
be held subsequently, on at least a yearly basis, so that participants can share experiences and leam
from the success and failures of others in the program.
4.90         A detailed Project Implementation Schedule will be established by CCPI to serve as
a baseline against which the overall project, its individual components and subcomponents, and the
integration across them can be evaluated in terms of the progress in meeting the project's objectives.
An overall project start up schedule will be developed by the CPPI Director and the General
Consultant Firm (GCF), in consultation with the CPPI Supervisory Board, component management
committees and the Bank. The milestones and deliverables envisioned as being appropriate for the
overall project start up implementation schedule are:
*     Subcomponent project manager appointments and training
*     Initial operation of the CPPI
*     Establishment of CPPI operational practices and procedures
Covering procurement, disbursements and administrative functions
*     Procurement of project support equipment (computers, office equipment, etc.
*     Overall project reporting procedures
4.91         Upon appointment of subcomponent project managers, this list of milestones and
deliverables will be expanded with the consultants advice and input to encompass the start-up activities
of component and subcomponent projects. Using the advice and assistance of the GCF, the SCPM's
and the CPPI Director will develop a start up project implementation schedule for each of these
subcomponent projects. The milestones and deliverables conceptually envisioned as being appropriate
for these schedules are:
*     Finalized subcomponent project descriptions and work plans
*     Final subcomponent project organization structures
*     Russian staff terms of reference and recruitment plans
*     Project office setup



62                                                       Environmental Management Project
*     Foreign consultant terms of reference
*     Russian experts terms of reference
*     Subcomponent project reporting procedures
*     Detailed subcomponent project implementation schedule
4.92         For each subcomponent project, a detailed project implementation schedule will be
developed by the SPCMs and CPPI Director, with the advice and assistance of the GCF based on the
detailed work plans and finalized project descriptions noted above. The attached schedules in Annexes
8.1-8.4 list some of the major milestones and deliverables anticipated to be included in detailed
schedules for each subcomponent project. These are based on the conceptual project descriptions
developed by MEPNR and the Bank.
3.    Monitoring of Development Objectives
4.93         A list of specific development objectives has been drawn up for the project and are
included in Table 4.5. The extent to which these objectives will be achieved will be the basis for
judging the progress and performance of the project during implementation, and will be a focus of
Bank supervision missions. It is considered that this list of objectives will provide a sufficiently
comprehensive overview of project performance without being overly cumbersome to monitor and
evaluate. On the other hand, it is sufficiently specific to give a realistic evaluation of performance
and progress. These objectives are also referenced in the Project Benefits section below to identify
the principal project benefits.
E.    Procurement
4.94         General. All Bank-financed items will be procured in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines. Table 4.6 summarizes the methods of procurement. The Project Procurement Plan
(Annex 9.1) details procurement administration, and contains procurement lists, notes, and schedules.
Donor financing of the EFP will be on a parallel basis and procurement of these items will follow the
donors' procurement procedures.
4.95         Technical Assistance. Implementation of the four technical assistance components of
EMP will require procurement of goods, the selection and employment of consulting firms and
individuals, and the employment of Russian staff. Assisted by the Project Management Advisory
Firm, the CPPI will undertake the procurement of all goods and will assist subcomponent management
committees, subcomponent implementing teams, and subcomponent project managers, with the
selection of consulting firms and individuals. For administrative purposes, all consulting firm
contracts over US$50,000 will be managed by the CPPI.
4.96         TechnicalAssistance Equipment. The equipment (totalling $10.43 million) comprises
mainly: (i) computers, peripherals and software (including computing equipment required for
scientific purposes, and for data base management); (ii) environmental monitoring equipment; and (iii)
office equipment required for the setting up and operation of the SITs. All contracts for goods over
$300,000 (estimated to total $7.60 million) will be awarded through International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) following the Bank's guidelines and using the Bank's standard bidding documents. Domestic
manufacturers competing under ICB would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the CIF
price, or the prevailing customs duty applicable to non-exempt importers, whichever is less, provided
the value added to the product exceeds 20% of the ex-factory bid price. To the extent possible, items
will be packaged suitable for procurement under ICB. For goods with an individual contract value
of no more than $300,000 up to an aggregate value of $ 2.33 million, procurement would be through
International Shopping; Local Shopping would apply for goods with contract value no more than



The Project                                                                        63
$10,000 each, up to an aggregate value of $0.50 million. All the goods contracts, with value at no
less than of $100,000 each, would be subject to prior review which would cover about 80% of the
total value of Bank-financed goods. The balance of the contracts would be subject to post review on
a selective basis by the Bank.
4.97         Technical Assistance Consulting Serices. Professional services (consulting services)
for technical assistance form a significant portion of project procurement ($39.98 million) and will be
provided by both firms and individual experts. The major consulting assignments and selection
schedules are given in Annex 9.3. A typical consultant selection schedule is given in the Project
Implementation Manual.
4.98         All consultants will be selected and employed following the World Bank's Guidelines
on the Use of Consultants and using the Bank's standard contract. Proposals will be invited from
shortlisted consulting firms for all assignments with an estimated value of no less than $100,000 each.
Individual consultants will be selected from an evaluation of the CVs of at least three candidates.
4.99         The Bank will require for its prior review, the terms of reference (TOR), the method
of selection, advertisements, letters of invitation, the proposed selection, and negotiated contract prior
to award for consultant services, except for contracts less than $100,000 each. However, this
exception to prior Bank review will not apply to TORs; single source selection of firms; employment
of individual consultants; or assignments of a critical nature.
4.100        National Pollution Abatement Facility. Most items and packages to be procured by
sub-borrowers will comprise industrial equipment, although the NPAF will also finance consulting
services for its own management and operation. NPAF financed goods (totalling $52.69 million) will
be procured by sub-borrowers following Bank procurement guidelines. NPAF sub-borrowers will use
ICB and Bank Standard Bidding Documents for all packages with greater than $2 million per contract;
domestic manufacturers would receive the margin of preference subject to the conditions noted above
(para 4.96). ICB contracts are estimated to total $19.0 million (including office equipment). All
packages with no more than $2 million per contract will be procured through International Shopping
on the basis of at least three quotations from suppliers in at least three countries, subject to an
aggregate ceiling of $33,190,000. Local Shopping based on three quotations will be used for packages
of no more than $10,000 each, subject to an aggregate ceiling of $500,000. The selection and
employment of consulting services (estimated at $4.19 million) will also follow the Bank's Consultant
Guidelines.
4.101        For each sub-loan, the Bank would review all documentation for procurement of goods
estimated to cost $300,000 or more per contract, i.e., the Bank would need to review and give its no
objections to the complete bid package prior to bids being invited (including the proposed
advertisement) and the proposed contract award with a detailed report covering bid opening and
evaluation. For consulting assignments, the Bank's review requirements would be as for other project
consulting assignments, as detailed above.

F.    Disbursement
4.102        The loan will finance for the NPAF, Technical Assistance Components and the CPPI:
(1) 100% of NPAF sub-loans and investment project preparation advances; (2) 100% of expenditures
of experts' services and training; (3) 100% of the foreign expenditures of imported goods, up to 100%
of the local expenditures (ex-factory costs), and up to 75% of the expenditures for other items
procured locally; (4) 100% of incremental recurrent costs for expenditures incurred up to November
30, 1997, and 50% thereafter; and (5) refinancing of the PPF (See Table 4.7).
4.103        The proceeds of the loan are expected to be disbursed in accordance with the
disbursement profile shown in Annex 6.3, over a period of six years, which is the same as the Bank's
average TA and financial intermediary profiles for all IBRD borrowers. The disbursement period was
determined after taking into account the advanced status of project design, the early setting up of the
CPPI with a PPF advance, and the commitment and willingness of agencies to be involved in the
project at all levels of government. Detailed loan disbursement tables are also given in Annexes 6.1
and 6.2.
4.104        The project is expected to be completed by October 31, 2000, and the loan closing
date would be June 30, 2001. Withdrawal applications will be fully documented, except for
expenditures against contracts valued at no more than US$50,000 equivalent, that will be made on the
basis of certified statements of expenditures (SOEs) detailing the individual transactions. The
documentation to support these expenditures will be retained by the CPPI and the NPAF for at least
one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement is
made. This documentation will be made available for review by the auditors (see sections below on
Financial Reporting and Auditing) and the Bank upon request.
4.105        To facilitate the disbursement of funds, a Special Account will be established in a
commercial bank acceptable to the Bank for the CPPI implemented TA components and the NPAF.
The authorized allocation to the Special Account will be $2 million, representing about four months
of average expenditures under the Loan. The account will be opened in the name of the Borrower and
will be administered by the authorized representative of the CPPI on behalf of the Borrower. The
CPPI will send on a monthly basis or more frequently, if necessary, to the Bank requests for
replenishment of the Special Account for the amounts transferred. In addition, monthly bank
statements of the special account that have been reconciled by the Borrower should accompany all
replenishment requests.

G.      Project Accounting, Financial Reporting, and Auditing
4.106            The CPPI will establish appropriate accounting systems to ensure timely and accurate
accounting of all transactions under project. The staffing of the CPPI with a financial adviser will
enable the project implementation agency to maintain all project accounts in accordance with
internationally accepted accounting practices. The Borrower will ensure that all the necessary
arrangements for proper accounting of receipts and payments (and replenishment) are complete before
the start of the Special Account's operations. The proposed accounting and financial reporting
procedures are outlined in Annex 6.2.
4.107            The annual financial statements and reports on the Project (including the Special
Account) would be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by independent
auditors (preferably an international accounting firm) acceptable to the Bank. The annual audit report
is to be submitted to the Bank by CPPI within four months after the end of each fiscal year.
H.      Project Supervision
4.108            As shown in Annex 10, the Supervision Plan for this project is designed on the basis
of three mutually supporting arrangements, including World Bank Headquarters and Resident Mission
staff, and a General Consultant Firm (GCF). This plan not only includes regular supervision
activities, but also incorporates assistance for the project start-up phase, a Project Launch Workshop,
18/ALL EXPENDITURES, EXCLUDING TAXES AND DUTIES.



68                                                       Environmental Management Project
and at least yearly Project Review workshops, to bring together the SCPM; SCMC Chairpersons;
CPPI Director, MEPNR and World Bank staff to learn from experiences and to make adjustments to
the program as required. Donors responsible for implementing components of EFP will also be
invited to attend.
4.109        Bank supervision missions would take place three times per year, with Resident
mission staff providing on-going support in between these missions.
4.110        The General Consultant Firm is expected to begin its work following Board
presentation. The GCF would employ one full time foreign project manager with technical expertise
in one of the subject areas of the project, at least for the first two years of its contract. This expert
would train and assist not only the CPPI Director as overall project manager, but would also work
with other foreign specialist advisors from the GCF in training and assisting the subcomponent project
managers during project start-up and implementation. The detailed knowledge of the project that the
GCF would gain during project start-up will greatly enhance their ability and effectiveness in
providing continuing advise to the Russian SCPMs for supervision of the project as a whole. These
consultants also will draw up an overall training plan for the project which will be updated at regular
intervals. As shown in Annex 10, it is expected that the GCF would provide approximately 100
consultant months of start-up and supervision support to the Project over its four-year life. The GCF
would be responsible for independently auditing the quality of the work being performed by other
Russian and foreign experts on the various subcomponents, as well as for evaluating project
performance and progress in meeting its designated objectives and planned schedules. They would
prepare tri-yearly supervision reports for evaluation by MEPNR and the Bank, and would assist the
CPPI in preparing the final Implementation Completion Report.
I.    Environmental Assessment
4.111        The project is consistent with Bank policy and follows accepted Bank EA procedures;
it has been assigned a "B" rating for EA purposes. In conformity with Bank practice detailed
environmental guidelines and procedures have been drawn up for subproject environmental appraisal
including: (i) environmental selection criteria evaluation; (ii) environmental assessment; and (iii)
environmental liability auditing as required. In addition, sub-borrowers from the NPAF will be
responsible for ensuring that the proposed investment complies with all applicable environmental
assessment rules, regulations, and procedures of the Russian Federation. Efforts are currently
underway to harmonize the Russian Federation and World Bank Environmental Assessment guidelines.
This should help to minimize compliance difficulties and speed the approval process. Annex 4.5
provides details on the proposed guidelines and procedures to be established by the NPAF
Management to meet both Russia Government and World Bank EA requirements.
J.    Benefits and Risks
1.    Project Benefits
4.112        The specific benefits that are expected to accrue as a result of this project are as
follows:
(1)   the establishment of national databases and standardized methodologies and systems
for the collection and verification of environmental health and hazardous waste
generation data for policymakers at the national and regional levels;
(2)   the upgrading and adoption of overall environmental action plans based on



The Project                                                                        69
environmental health priorities at the national level and in the Upper Volga and Urals
regions, and the first phase implementation of these plans to test and demonstrate their
application;
(3)   the development and Phase I implementation and adoption of specific action plans
for water quality and resource management in the Upper Volga, Urals and North
Caucasus Regions, and sectoral environmental action and Phase I implementation
plans for:  (a) iron and steel; (b) non-ferrous metals; (c) oil refining and
petrochemicals; (d) basic organic and inorganic chemicals; and (e) agriculture with
particular attention to intensive livestock operations;
(4)   the formulation and adoption of improved regulatory systems and enforcement
mechanisms for water quality and water resource management in the Upper Volga
and North Caucasus regions; for hazardous waste management in the Upper Volga
region and for environmental assessment at the national level;
(5)   the dissemination of the experience and the results of project financed activities to
other regions in the Russian Federation through a national outreach program;
(6)   the establishment and management of a national facility to fund investment in
pollution abatement and improved resource utilization and recovery. The effectiveness
of this Facility will be judged on the basis of the amount of private loan and equity
funds it is able to leverage for pollution abatement, the extent of pollution reduction
achieved through its investments and its ability to address pollution priorities identified
under items (2) and (3) above;
(7)   the improved organization, management and training of staff of environmental
regulatory agencies at the federal level and in the Upper Volga, the Urals, and the
North Caucasus regions; and
(8)   facilitating donor participation in the environmental sector in Russia through the
establishment of a Center for Project Preparation and Implementation and donor
involvement in project workshops.
2.    Project Risks
4.113        The main risks that the project may face include: (1) the fragmented decision making
process for environmental management at the federal and regional levels; (2) the shortage of
experienced and qualified Russian specialists in environmental economics and law; (3) the poor
environmental regulation enforcement capability of the legal system in Russia; (4) conflicting mandates
and lack of cooperation between government agencies and even between departments within the same
agency; (5) possible delays in project implementation due to a lack of familiarity with Bank procedures
and the requirements of project management in general; (6) difficulties in arranging local cost
financing for pollution abatement; and (7) potential adverse impacts of high inflation on projects
financed by the NPAF. The project will build on initiatives already being introduced by the
Government in order to address these issues. Firstly, at the federal level, the project will be under
the direction of the recently formed Federal Commission on the Environment (with MEPNR acting
as the Secretariat of this Commnission), which has been set up to improve inter-agency cooperation and
decision making for environmental management. The regional project areas were selected on the basis
of already existing arrangements for promoting inter-agency cooperation for environmental



70                                                         Environmental Management Project
management and their governments strong commitments to environmental quality improvement
(usually because of strong local community pressures). The project proposes an early start to a
comprehensive training program to improve skills in environmental policy and regulation, as well as
in the technical areas of environmental epidemiology, hazardous waste, water quality management and
project management. The use of twinning arrangements with foreign institutes will ensure practical
application in the development of these skills. Trained personnel will also be delegated to work at
regional, as well federal level to transfer their skills. In the participating regions, cooperative
arrangements for pollution abatement at major polluting enterprises will be negotiated with appropriate
incentive arrangements for compliance with agreed permit schedules.
4.114         To minimize risks of project implementation delays, framework agreements have been
reached with federal and regional agencies that will be responsible for project implementation laying
out in detail the responsibilities and arrangements for component implementation. These agreements
have been initialed by the respective parties and will be formalized as binding resolutions after Board
approval. The early setting up and staffing of the CPPI and recruitment of a Project Management
Advisory Firm to assist the CPPI with the setting up of procurement, financial and information
management systems has been designated to reduce risks of implementation delays. The NPAF will
be especially equipped to assist borrowers to put together packages for project financing including a
full array of financing arrangements from local and foreign sources. One of the criteria on which the
NPAF operations will be judged will be its ability to leverage other sources of financing. IPPAs
would enable enterprises to develop high quality projects to the stage where they meet the requirement
for NPAF project financing. The pollution abatement projects that will be targeted by the NPAF have
a number of inherent characteristics that will protect them from the impacts of high inflation, namely:
(i) recovery of valuable resources from waste streams with zero or negative costs; and (ii) end
products that have a high economic value in world markets and are exportable.

ANNEX 2
DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL FRAMEWORK
PROGRAM NOT FUNDED BY THE WORLD BANK
A.    Human Resources and Training Subcomponent
1.    Russian professionals have had little opportunity to develop analytical, managerial and
entrepreneurial skills, having previously worked in what were rigidly structured and segmented
governmental entities. There is a need to encourage cross-disciplinary thinking, creative speculation,
and intellectual risk taking in dealing with policy and strategy issues in the environmental and
resources management field. To develop such skills, and to break down the resistance to debating
issues outside the expert's field, role playing and case studies will be used. The focus will be on
encouraging policy debate and examining strategy alternatives in an atmosphere of intellectual
openness. The objective of this subcomponent is to develop suitable training courses and to train
trainers, as well as to develop the capacity of Russian institutions to continue the ongoing training
courses.
2.    The level of education in the physical and biological sciences is impressive in the FSU; and
there is a valuable reservoir of technical talent within the MEPNR and its regional committees.
However, based on the training needs assessment, four subject areas have been identified to receive
priority:
*     policy, programming and decision-making at the federal and regional levels;
*     operational proficiency and managerial capabilities within the Ministry;
*     environmental assessment and enforcement capabilities of the Ministry and its
territorial bodies; and
*     public education, participation and conflict resolution.
3.    An important part of the training program is to build an informal network of Environmental
Management Training Centers throughout the Russian Federation. The Centers would develop, adapt
and deliver short-term training activities (from three-day to two-week sessions) for the following
audiences: all levels of governments, representatives of industry, private consulting firms, and NGOs.
The first center would be based in Moscow. The Moscow center would initially support other centers
located in several different geographic regions. Ultimately, all of the centers would be independent
and self-supporting, sharing information, workshop materials and training experiences. In addition to
delivering training sessions in Moscow, the Moscow Center would coordinate the dissemination of
training materials, provide technical assistance, and sponsor national conferences for representatives
of the other training centers. As the Academy of Management in Moscow has the best training
facilities and Moscow State University has access to the greatest diversity of expertise, these
institutions seem to be the best initial candidates for forming a consortium, in which one or the other
has lead responsibility.

4.    The Human Resources and Training Subcomponent will assist in the setting up of these
training centers and in developing the training programs and delivery mechanisms. It will also fund
the start-up costs of the centers while they become self-supporting.
B.    Regional and Local Demonstration Pilot Projects
5.    Four local demonstration institutional and policy development pilot projects are proposed under
the framework program in the following regions and cities:
*     Khabarovsk Krai
*     Nizhnii Tagil
*     Novokuznetsk
*     Murmansk Oblast
6.    Khabarovsk Krai Demonstration Pilot Project. Khabarovsk Krai in Eastern Siberia is
extremely well-endowed with many natural resources. Prominent among these are nonferrous metals,
as well as forest resources. The Government expects a considerable increase in tin, gold and silver
mining and refining activity, with active involvement by foreign companies. Since this industry has
enormous potential for major environmental degradation, the following three activities are proposed
for the local pilot program:
*     Support for the Krai in developing environmental regulations and legislation by
establishing twinning relationships with a similar local government in an OECD
country;
*     Improving the enforcement capability of Khabarovsk's Committee of Environment
through the training of environmental inspectors in the techniques and principles of
environmental enforcement; and
3     Development of a comprehensive sectoral environmental action plan (SEAP) for the
Krai mining sector.
7.    Nizhnii Tagil Demonstration Pilot Program. Nizhnii Tagil is an industrial city of 438,000
people located on the eastern slopes of the Ural Mountains, about 150 km north of the oblast capital
of Ekaterenburg. Founded in 1722 on the site of a large copper deposit (now exhausted), it has long
been a major center for mining, metallurgy, and manufacturing. A demonstration project in Nizhnii
Tagil would take advantage of the comparative advantages offered by Ekaterenburg and other sites in
Sverdlovsk Oblast. Ekaterenburg has a strong institutional infrastructure, that can support training and
other activities requiring local staff and financing. It is expected that as the project develops,
opportunities will be identified for identifying smaller activities within the overall framework.
Four principal activities have been identified:
*     Environmental planning and priority setting,including the development of a local
environmental action plan (LEAP) for the city of Nizhnii Tagil;
*     Environmental education, involving parents, teachers and citizens in a community-
wide curriculum development process for primary and secondary school children,
which could eventually be adopted at the National level.



Annex 2                                                                             75
*     Environmental technology transfer and cooperation, through the application of
specially targeted environmental audits, demonstration of low-cost innovative
technologies and improved management practices, setting up of an international
business center in Ekaterinburg to improve access to information on low waste
technologies and practices, and training.
*     Strengthen environmental institutional arrangements in Nizhnii Tagil to improve
environmental management capabilities of the city authorities.
8.    Novokuznetsk Demonstration Pilot Project. Novokuznetzk is located in southeast of Western
Siberia, and is situated in the southern part of Kemerovo Oblast, at the center of the Kuzbass
urbanized region that covers about 12,000 square kilometers. The population in this area is
approximately 1.2 million, of which about 600,000 live in Novokuznetsk. Novokuznetsk is
characterized by large coal deposits that are shaft-mined (city center) and open pit-mined (north of
the city). The city has 120 industrial enterprises, of which metallurgy accounts for about 68 percent
and coal mining about 13 percent of production. Novokuznetsk has been named one of the most
heavily polluted cities in the Russian Federation.
9.    An integrated approach to addressing environmental problems has been adopted in
Novokuznetsk as reflected in the documentation prepared for a local environmental action program
(LEAP). The LEAP provides details of: (1) environmental problems by media and sources; (2) public
health impacts; (3) a proposed 10-year program of investment to reduce pollutant emissions and
loadings by enterprise (public and private); (4) operations and plants to be shut down and
reconstructed; (5) an initial cost-benefit analysis to justify the proposed investment pattern; and (6)
an initial calculation of how environmental investments accounted for in the plan can be supported
with enterprise internal cash flows and government (public) funding. A set of appendixes has also been
provided that contains additional technical information, including engineering diagrams and
specifications related to specific enterprise investments that should be reviewed by foreign technical
specialists, including environmental and process engineers.
10.   Two principal activities are proposed:
*     Strengthening of the Local Environmental Action Program. Novokuznetsk authorities
have already made considerable progress toward developing a local environmental
action plan supported by all social and economic groups, and with assistance from the
Weldon Foundation has linked up through a sister city arrangement with the City of
Pittsburgh in the United States. However, the local authorities are well aware that the
Action Plan only partially reflects the environmental policy and institutional options
that need to be addressed, and have requested bilateral assistance in filling these gaps.
*     Local and Overseas Training. Training will be provided for: (a) specialists located
at the various institutes in Novo Kuznetsk which already provide environmental
training; (b) municipal planning and administrative staff; (c) personnel of polluting
enterprises; and (d) NGO personnel. The objectives of this subcomponent are to
strengthen the environmental skills and performance of key local government decision
makers, to raise awareness of environmental issues and enable them to solve the
technical problems in a cost effective way.

11.   Mumansk Oblast Demonstration Pilot Program. Mumansk Oblast on the Kola Peninsula
covers an area of 145,000 kmn2 adjacent to Norway and Finland. The total population is 1,098,000
with 472,000 in the capital city of Mammansk. Industry represents 80 percent of the GNP of the
region with 40 percent directly relating to the exploitation of natural resources, especially minerals
and timber. Extensive pollution is caused by two large nickel/copper smelting complexes in Nikel -
Zapolyarny and Monchegovsk, with severe health and ecological impacts. The activities proposed
under this project can be grouped as follows:
*     Improvement of the environmental institutional arrangements at the Oblast level
including: environmental information systems, emission permitting and enforcement
systems; policy formulation and implementation; organizational arrangements;
development of least cost investment options for pollution control;
*     Preparation of a forest master plan, which will include sustainable forest
management practices and production methods; forest protection and multiple use;
institutional strengthening of forest organizations; and small scale forest industries.
*     Improved environmental management practices in selected enterprises through the
preparation of environmental management plans, preparation of feasibilities studies
investment planning and preparation of investment proposals. In screening these
projects, Ministry officials would try to identify projects that (1) are financially viable,
(2) have financial and engineering feasibility studies already underway, (3) will have
a cost-effective, material impact on pollution abatement; and (4) might be able to
attract foreign partners and foreign financial support.
C.    Air Quality Management Component
12.   Overview. Air quality management (AQM) in Russia is oriented toward control of stationery
sources. Oversight of the process is provided centrally by MEPNR and responsibilities for
implementation of the system are delegated to the oblasts, rions, and cities. Since 60 percent of the
pollution fee revenue is kept by the local Committee of Environmental Protection, their role in air
quality management is very strong and they appear to operate with considerable autonomy.
13.   The Russian system of air quality management consists of the following key features: use of
air quality norms (standards) to set targets for the ambient concentration of over 1000 pollutants; air
quality monitoring and emission inventories to help establish emission limits for these pollutants;
approvals for land; and establishment of maximum permissible emission (MPE) rates for enterprises
and of sanitary protection zones (SPZs) around these enterprises where concentrations of one or more
of these pollutants may be exceeded; and development of an ecological passport that defines emission
limits and pollution fees for emitting pollutants, or consuming natural resources. The legal foundation
for implementing this system is evolving, but the basic analytical framework for AQM has been in
use for some time.
14.   Problems and solutions. The current Russian AQM system seeks to ensure that emissions of
pollutants from an enterprise do not cause the maximum pollutant concentrations (MPCs) to be
exceeded outside of the SPZ, around that enterprise. The system focuses on individual sources and
their immediate surroundings, rather than on the collective impacts of all of the sources of a given
pollutant in the area, and this focus on individual sources can inhibit identification of the least-cost
solutions to an area's air quality problems.



Annex 2                                                                              77
15.   Russia's AQM program currently is too complex and cumbersome to enable sources to react
to changes in the world marketplace. It needs to be simplified and streamnlined so that sources can
adapt to changing markets and attempt innovative modifications to products and production methods.
Industrial enterprises could then attain the norms in their most cost-effective manner. The system also
needs to be able to deal effectively with uncooperative managers of industrial concerns
16.   There are several specific aspects of the Russian AQM system that should be improved if the
system is to work efficiently and be more cost effective. These are: (1) reduce the large number of
pollutants (over 1000) for which norms have been developed; 2) simplify the "synergy" concept that
attempts to consider the combined effect of pollutants on health; 3) establish a "de minimis" concept
for regulating emissions or making process changes; 4) modify the legal system to facilitate
enforcement of the control strategies and provide for redress by the regulator, sources or citizens; 5)
update the outmoded technology used for ambient and source measurements and the data systems in
which measurement information are stored; (6) refocus the current system to enable Russian regulators
to manage the collective impacts of all of the sources in an area; and (7) address the transport of
pollutants into neighboring countries and global air issues.
17.   Pilot program. Many cities in Russia have significant air pollution problems, with pollutant
concentrations that are over 10 times the MPC level. These high levels are generally caused by
concentrations of large industrial enterprises (for instance, metallurgical plants, petrochemicals, and
oil refining). The MEPNR have identified a number of highly polluted areas that are of particular
interest for siting a pilot program to upgrade the AQM system.
18.   Volgograd was selected for several reasons: (1) the area contains a wide and diverse mixture
of industrial sources and although the urbanized area is long and narrow (stretching 70 kilometers
along the Volga River), there are several distinct clusters of sources that can be used either separately
or together to demonstrate potential changes to the AQM system; (2) the area is relatively accessible
by rail and air; (3) the local government, including the Mayor's office and the City's Environmental
Services Administration are anxious to cooperate; (4) the industries are actively seeking joint ventures
and other forms of financial support for restructuring antiquated production process; (5) the City
Environmental Services Administration appears to be quite capable and their leader is dynamic and
enthusiastic about the program; (6) while Volgograd's air quality problems are not the most severe
in Russia, they are serious, especially in the summer; and (7) there is a strong NGO community in
Volgograd that is linked to local environmental management through representation on both elected
governing bodies and advisory committees.
19.   Russian Air Management Program (RAMP). The US EPA Office of Air Quality Planning
and Standards has agreed to manage a Russian air management program (RAMP) for Volgograd to
demonstrate the potential changes to the Russian system of air quality management for the MEPNR
and to assist them in making those changes Russia-wide. All components of the AQM system will be
demonstrated in the pilot area (for example, ambient monitoring, emissions measurement, emissions
inventory methodology, data management, air quality modeling, and control strategy development at
the least cost to the enterprises in the area).
20.   Oversight of the RAMP will be through the formation of a RAMP management team. The
management team will consist of the following: US EPA Program Manager (coordinating US EPA
staff and contractors); MEPNR Program Manager (coordinating Ministry staff, other Russian Federal
Government groups, and contractors employed by the Ministry); Director of the Scientific Research
Institute of Atmospheric Air Protection (SRIAAP) in St. Petersburg; and Chairperson of Volgograd
City Environmental Services Administration (ESA), (representing the city government, local NGOs,



78                                                       Environmental Management Project
the Volgograd Scientific Ecological Soviet, the Volgograd Oblast Committee for Ecology and Nature
Protection, contractors employed by the City for this study, and local enterprises).
21.   The management team will be made up of AQM experts and will be responsible for managing
the program and making specific policy recommendations. The various RAMP teams also would
include substantial involvement of US EPA technical and air policy staff (Office of Air Quality
Planning and Standards),  consultants (both Russian and foreign), and Russian environmental
engineers, scientists, economists and planners representing MEPNR and the Volgograd Oblast and
City staffs.
22.   The objectives of RAMP are to: characterize air quality in the Volgograd area using modern
monitoring methodologies; improve AQM principles, policies, and compliance methods; improve the
Russian Federation's technical approach to solving air quality problems and develop a preliminary
least-cost control strategy in Volgograd as a demonstration; and work with the MEPNR and key
oblasts to make similar improvements throughout Russia.
23.   RAMP is a comprehensive project that will continue for four to five years, and is structured
in the following phases:
*     Phase I. Evaluate existing air quality and emissions information and identify priorities
for developing environmental action plans. This should include a preliminary
evaluation of ambient and source measurement methods and the emission inventory.
*     Phase II. Beginning with Volgograd, strengthen the Russia-wide air quality
management capabilities and institutions. This would include: (1) assisting in
rationalizing the Russian system of air quality norms, reviewing and improving the
emission inventory methods, source test methods, and emission factors; (2) reviewing
and revising atmospheric dispersion modeling, air quality monitoring, and siting and
quality assurance methods, and developing a long-term plan for creating an interactive
data storage system; (3) improving and revising the system for regulating new and
existing sources and source modifications; (4) working with local, Federal and oblast
officials Russia-wide to disseminate information and help make changes to the Russian
system; and (5) developing methods for assessing and managing pollutant transport
and transboundary/global air pollution problems through local and regional control
programs.
*     Phase III. Upgrade Volgograd's air pollution monitoring, assessment and planning
capabilities and information collection and processing. This would include: (1) the
upgrade of laboratory and field measurement capabilities and monitoring procedures
for ambient air and source emissions; and (2) the source testing, saturation
monitoring, and receptor and airshed modeling.
D.    Water Quality and Water Resource Management Component
24.   The Russian Federation has developed an extensive system for water quality management at
the central and regional levels including a national monitoring system of over 2200 stations with
regional available laboratory services, a regular and systematic program with detailed methodologies
for river basin water balances and preparation of master plans, and central and regional institutional



Annex 2                                                                               79
infrastructure for waste discharge regulation and permitting. Nevertheless, this system has not been
successful at preventing a serious decline in water quality in the country's rivers, lakes, and
reservoirs, and major ecological damage in some areas.
25.   Issues. A number of areas have been identified where methodological, procedural, and
infrastructure improvements in the regulatory and discharge permitting system would have a significant
impact, including developing cost-effective local monitoring systems to support permitting and
enforcement; strengthening local laboratory services; developing an effective national quality assurance
program; and establishing a more appropriate and flexible system of standards. However, the critical
issues are the lack of effective incentives to ensure compliance, of awareness of the value of water,
and of what will be required to improve the situation; and lack of commitment on the part of the
public and local officials and enterprise managers to take action. Where these latter constraints do not
exist and there is local commitment to change, there has already been notable progress.
26.    The existing monitoring system, for example, was developed for a different set of goals and
conditions from those that exist today. The present system was designed to provide a basis for river
basin water balances and overall indication of the trends in water quantity and quality, not to support
local management of water quantity or quality. There is great reliance on an apparently very weak
system of self-monitoring.
27.   The operation of local infrastructure of water supply, distribution, and treatment has been less
effective than would be possible with current design and control system practice, and effective
maintenance. The inability to adequately protect water sources has become an important issue as
inappropriate land uses and economic activities have expanded in the watershed areas of major water
supply sources. The current institutional, regulatory, and financial system appears unable to cope with
this serious trend.
28.   The sector is also profoundly affected by the political and economic changes that are taking
place. There is increased uncertainty about the legal framework, caused by frequent changes in
leadership and laws that makes effective regulation and management nearly impossible. More
profound, however, are the changes in thinking and perception that must be developed and
accommodated in the current system of water quality and quantity management being brought about
by the shifting roles of the central Ministries, Republics, and Oblasts especially with the emergence
of local autonomy and decision-making, the introduction of private property and the privatization of
industry, the introduction of more realistic prices, the introduction of water charges, and the effort
to enforce the "polluter pays" principal. These changes, for example, require fundamental changes in
many of the assumptions that underlay the methods and processes used in water resources planning
and management. The present system both from a methodological and institutional point of view has
tended to fragment responsibility for water quantity and quality management and to create barriers to
the effective introduction of environmental considerations in decision-making.
29.    Water resources planning. The Committee for Water Resources Management is responsible
for preparation of the federal plans for management and protection of water resources, and the river
basin plans. On the basis of these plans, local water agencies develop water management guidelines
for smaller rivers and their basins. All these planning efforts concem both water quantity and quality.
At present all plans are made for the horizon of 2010, and in accordance with the former practice they
are supposed to be updated every five years. In the FSU, similar plans served as a basis for the
centrally decided (subject to negotiations) resource allocation among different republics. Allocation
quotas have been defined for three water availability scenarios-dry, normal and wet years.



80                                                       Environmental Management Project
30.   The past planning approaches and methodology are currently being adjusted to the new
economic and political situation. The work is being done mostly by SOYUZVODPROJECT, which
is a research arm of the Committee for Water Resources Management. The ongoing efforts address
three principal issues: (1) what are the best ways for incorporation of the appropriate environmental
and ecological criteria; 2) how to allocate water among over 80 territorial bodies of the Federation
who in several cases are already involved in bilateral or multi-lateral negotiations over the use of
shared water resources, and (3) how to combine so far dominating central allocation principles with
the introduction of economic incentives (water as an economic good). Although allocation by price
mechanisms is not a viable proposition under the existing economic situation, it is very likely that local
water markets will be emerging (trade in water armong autonomous republics, oblasts, or between
different categories of water users, for example, irrigation and municipalities).
31.   Project priorities, strategies and objectives. A framework for the water quality management
component of the Environmental Management Project is outlined in Table A3.3.1. The priorities for
environmental management in the water sector identified by MEPNR and the Committee of Water
Resources Management include:
*     Ensure the availability and supply of safe drinking water;
3     Restore and maintain the ecological health of rivers and other water ; and
*     Promote water conservation and strengthen integrated water quality and quantity
management.
32.   The strategy and objectives (Annex 3.3 ) reflect the issues identified above and discussed at
length with the key agencies in the sector. Hence the strategy for ensuring the availability and supply
of safe drinking water focuses on protecting sources of supply, including reducing pollution loads,
expanding the sources of supply, improving the effectiveness of drinking water treatment. The third
priority focuses on water conservation and strengthening integrated water resource management, and
the corresponding strategy will focus on economic incentives, institutional strengthening, and building
greater public awareness.
33.   Pilot Projects. The specific objectives outlined in Annex 3.3 will be addressed under the
Program through pilot projects implemented at the oblast or watershed level in different regions. These
projects will provide an opportunity to develop, test, adapt, and demonstrate new methods and
procedures, train personnel and develop training materials, and prepare and implement integrated
water quality management action plans. The pilot projects will also address both immediate and long-
term needs. Criteria for identification and selection of pilot projects and a preliminary list of regions
where the pilot projects could be located, were agreed with the MEPNR during pre-appraisal. The
criteria strongly focus on determining the interest and commitment of local people and organizations
to participate in and support the project, local problems and priorities, the availability of data and
information to support a pilot project, and the importance and relevance of the problems to the
framework in Table A3.3. 1. The following were finally selected for inclusion in the pilot program.
*     Komi Republic, including the cities of Syktyvkar and Vorkuta;
*     Kostroma and Yaroslav oblasts in the Upper Volga River basin, including the cities
of Kostrama, Yaroslavl and Rybinsk, and the village of Borok;
*     Tver, Smolensk, and Moscow Oblasts in the Upper Volga and Moscow River basins,
including the city of Konakovo, and the Ivankovskaya and Istranskaya Reservoirs;
*     Rostov Oblast and the Lower Don River basin; and
*     Sverdlovsk Oblast, including the cities of Nizhnii Tagil and Ekaterenburg.

34.   A list of 14 activities is given in Table A2. 1. While some of the activities deal with specific
problems that recur in many areas and municipalities, a strong desire was expressed in every region
for the preparation of a coherent and integrated water management action plan; for efforts to
strengthen and improve management, particularly the development of new tools and strategies for
permitting and enforcement; for the demonstration of new, low-cost technology; and for the
implementation of new management actions as a part of the pilot projects. A clear understanding of
the need to examine and strengthen the inter-relations among quality and quantity issues was widely
felt. Both preventive and curative actions were stressed by local officials.
35.   These findings are reflected in the proposal for the preparation of an integrated action plan
in every region (Table A2.1). Since there are important differences and variations in individual
proposals that reflect local conditions and opportunities, they will collectively represent a large body
of experience that can be useful to many other regions and areas of Russia and the Republics of the
FSU.
36.   The widely recognized need to focus on improving the effectiveness of managing small
watersheds, and to introduce new technologies that can be used by individual enterprises, farms, and
villages to protect and manage their water and land resources is reflected in the activities that focus
on the management of small watersheds and the demonstration of practical, low-cost technologies (one
in the Lower Don River basin, and one in the watersheds that are the source of drinking water for
Moscow City).
37.   A single pilot activity is proposed to improve monitoring, although it was observed that
present systems need restructuring and improvement in all the regions visited. The proposed pilot will
focus on the Moscow water supply watershed system in the Upper Volga and Moscow River basins.
Under the pilot, new monitoring concepts in relation to network design, equipment, and operation will
be formulated to serve the needs for emergency warning, trend analysis, and water resources
management. The objective is to develop and test new cost-effective and affordable approaches to
strengthen and improve the existing system in support of these three purposes.
38.   The need to upgrade present laboratories and field sampling methods, equipment and capability
was also identified and a pilot activity with Moscow Drinking Water Service System has been included
to this effect. A quality assurance program essential to the delivery of reliable comparable, and usable
environmental data will also be implemented under this activity.
39.   Four of the remaining seven pilot projects deal specifically with municipal water supply issues;
and the last three deal with strengthening permitting systems, improving industrial pre-treatment
controls and industrial environmental audits. Two of the drinking water pilot projects (located in
Sverdlovsk Oblast), will focus on building effective local and oblast institutions for drinking water
quality management, and develop action plans to improve and protect sources of water supply. A third
pilot (located in Rybinsk) will focus on water conservation; while the fourth will address special
problems and needs of small municipalities in dealing with their technical mess.
E.    Hazardous Waste Management Component -
Hazardous Waste Environmental Management Studies
40.   There are three subcomponent of the Hazardous Waste Management Component, two of which
are being funded under EMP and are described in Annex 3.4.



82                                                         Environmental Management Project
41.   The third subcomponent project included within the Hazardous Waste Component involves
undertaking up to six waste related environmental management studies within specific enterprises, each
considered representative of key industrial sectors. These studies are intended to be financed by donor
participants in the Framework Program.
42.   These enterprise specific projects have been jointly identified and assessed by MEPNR and
the IBRD missions. In each case, the work will be directed to comprehensive environmental
management studies, utilizing waste audit techniques as demonstrations. The enterprises have been
selected on the basis that they are in need of assistance in relation to current and potential
environmental impacts related to hazardous waste, they are representative and viable enterprises in the
long term, and their management appears committed to improvement of current practice.
43.   In addition, they represent candidates for clean technology and resource recovery investments
which can enhance productivity, profitability and export potential through application of waste
minimization and resource recovery technology in implementing improved waste management
practices. Therefore, these studies are designed to assist the particular enterprises involved in
qualifying for financing from the National Pollution Abatement Facility (NPAF), whenever
appropriate. The scope of the study work undertaken will include the identification of key investments
for technological change and/or infrastructure additions, evaluation of the economic and environmental
enhancements that these may offer, and their documentation in the form of creditable business plans
and financing proposals.
44.   This subcomponent project addresses the MEPNRs priority to carry out projects in selected
enterprises and industrial sectors in various parts of the country to enable the transfer and adaptation
of modern approaches and technologies especially designed to reduce public exposure to hazardous
waste, minimize creation of new waste, and reduce the volume of existing stored waste.
45.   The individual studies and implementation plans will provide accurate data on waste quantities
and characteristics; waste storage, transport, processing, and disposal practices; and the environment
in which waste generation and transport takes place. This information will also be useful for the core
Hazardous Waste Management Component subcomponent projects involving the development of a
national industrial waste data management system, and the development of regulatory management
capability at the regional level.
46.   These Environmental Management Studies will also provide information on the process
technologies and raw materials used in producing products and which generate waste.  The
multidisciplinary skills of enterprise employees, Institute and industry association experts, as well as
the emerging Russian environmental consulting community and foreign experts, will be brought to
bear to identify changes in current operating practices, as well as options for applying pollution
prevention techniques and technologies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of waste
management practices. Building ongoing capability for performing environmental management studies
in the Russian Federation is an integral part of this project. Means for building this capability in
carrying out the project, as well as ways to sustain an ongoing capability in the Russian Federation
are important benefits to be derived from it.
47.   The following provides a brief overview of the six enterprise specific projects identified within
this subcomponent project:



Annex 2                                                                               83
1. PRESSA Publishing House - Moscow
48.    This enterprise is one of the largest printing operations in Europe, producing a complete range
of publications from newspapers, books to specialty printing products. It employs a wide range of
technology, much of it involving significant air and waste water emissions. These include discharges
of caustic materials, volatile and soluble organic solvents, and large volumes of heavy metals,
particularly lead, chromium and zinc. It recognizes that to avoid increasing pollution for assessments
and to be in a position to service broader markets, substantial changes in practice will be required.
A number of initiatives are proposed for evaluation, based on current practice in western countries.
These include ink replacements, expanded use of electronic printing technology, metals and organic
material recovery from air and waste water, and employment of "closed loop" water management
systems.
2. Tula Cartridge Works - Tula
49.   This enterprise has been a major defense industry that is now a joint stock company and which
has converted approximately 80 percent of its production capacity from munitions to consumer and
industrial products, such as vacuum cleaners, tableware, valves, chains, bellows, and photographic
equipment. It is a major generator of metal finishing wastes, notably those from electroplating, as are
a number of other similar enterprises in the area. Recognizing both the environmental impact, of
these waste discharges and the potential to develop a service capability for the region's industry, they
have identified the possibility to develop a commercial treatment facility that would service a sizeable
regional market, which would recover heavy metals from these wastes.
3. Lakokraska Company - Yaroslavl
50.   This enterprise is the largest paint and coatings producer in Russia, being the major supplier
of consumer and industrial paints and pigments. Traditionally, the technology employed has been
based on metals bearing materials and solvent based formulations, many of which are falling out of
use in the west for environmental reasons and associated regulatory restrictions. The change over of
this basic industry to the use of more environmentally friendly technologies such as powder (dry) and
water based paints would enhance this enterprises' export potential as well as that of its industrial
customers.
4. Jaroslavlpetroliumstintez Oil Refinery Group - Yaroslavl
51.   This industrial group operates several large oil refinery complexes in Yaroslavl and represents
the major refined products supplier for the region, as well as a significant exporter. This operation
is directing attention to resource recovery of substantial volumes of hydrocarbon residuals currently
stored in an extensive lagoon system, which represents a significant environmental hazard. The
specific study would focus on developing an integrated system of managing these and other waste
streams with an emphasis on being able to utilize them for refined product production, or as waste
derived fuel, potentially in the local centralized heating plants.
5. Cherepovetz Integrated Steel Complex - Cherepovetz
52.   This enterprise is the largest integrated steel works in European Russia, with approximately
13 million tons of installed capacity. It employs a range of technology including older open hearth
furnaces and an extensive coking operation. While the most common impact of the operation relates
to air emissions, something that is largely associated with the status of this area as priority for



84                                                        Environmental Management Project
environmental concern, the complex also produces a wide range of liquid and solid wastes that are
subject to land disposal and surface water discharge. The proposed study would be directed at
providing an overall environmental management plan which would provide for improved waste water
treatment, water recirculation and waste management practice upgrading.  All are considered
fundamental to maintaining the long term viability of the complex.
6. Novomosvosk Chemical Complex - Tula Oblast
53.   A group of four large organic and inorganic chemical enterprises is centered in this region.
They have been identified as an environmental priority by regional and national authorities. Specific
concerns include surface and ground water contamination, air impacts, and damage to national heritage
resources. The proposed study work would focus on developing environmentally sound alternatives
to current practices, particularly deep well injection, large scale use of waste water lagoons, and
landfilling of hazardous solid waste. Specific initiatives that could be examined include organic
chemical removal and reuse of process water, materials recovery from spent catalysts, and improved
thermal treatment and waste derived fuel usage.
F.    Biodiversity Conservation and Natural Resource Management Component
54.   Russia has relatively abundant renewable and non-renewable resources. In the past, to attain
development targets (for instance, industrial growth rates or an increase in foreign exchange earnings),
these resources were exploited under the assumption that there was a limitless supply . Natural
resource management (NRM) was never a consideration, and the environmental consequences were
not assessed in a systematic way. This is now changing.
55.   Public pressure is forcing emphasis on NRM and conservation of biodiversity. However, in
the search for new sources of growth and comparative advantage, there is strong pressure for federal,
regional and local governments to open access and to accelerate the use rates of natural resources even
to the extent of resource depletion and environmental degradation. This is being done in response to
short-term economic pressure.
56.   The objective of the proposed program is to strengthen Government capacity to manage its
natural resources, including biodiversity in a sustainable way. The project will assist Government in
three main areas.
57.   These activities will assist Government to assess trade-offs between development and natural
resource use at the national and regional levels, establish institutional arrangements for improved
NRM, identify relevant policies and investments to minimize environmental degradation while
improving welfare in the economy, and assess the extent to which sustainability of development in
many rural areas in the feasible objective. The program of assistance consists of these subcomponents:
(a) Biodiversity Strategic Overview and Action Plan; (b) Nature Protection Program; and (c) Lake
Baikal Program.
1. Biodiversity Strategic Overview and Action Plan (US$2.6 million)
58.   The conservation and management of biodiversity has become central to the Russian
Federation policy-making process. There is an increasing awareness among decision-makers that
economic reforms have (and will continue to have) a significant influence on how natural resources
crucial to biodiversity are allocated and used. In addition, decision-makers have also recognized that



Annex 2                                                                                 85
the systematic evaluation of biodiversity at the national level will require a wider and more explicit
national consensus, (e.g., objectives and instruments).
59.    The formulation of a National Biodiversity Strategy (NBS) in its role as both a document and
as a process, represents the manner in which this consensus ought to be reached. The strategy will
touch on issues and concerns linked to nation-wide policies, investments and institutions; assess the
state of those natural resources that are central to conservation and management; and present a strategy
and action plan. As a process, the elaboration of the strategy will assist in the development of the
necessary institutional arrangements (e.g., organizations, laws and regulations) to reflect the cross-
sectoral and multi-dimensional nature of biodiversity management at the national, regional and local
levels.
60.    The strategy will take into account the sectoral and inter-sectoral lirkages, and will present
an assessment focusing on the technical, economic, social and institutional aspects of the development
process. A topology of situations will be developed and analyzed for a wide spectrum of areas, from
those designated as protected to those that are heavily used and have major significance for
biodiversity. Special emphasis will be given to NRM and its impacts on biodiversity within the
development context of the Russian Federation. The Biodiversity Action Plan will establish and will
outline actions to be taken in the short, medium and long term.
61.    Biodiversity Strategy. The National Biodiversity Strategy (NBS) will have a program of
actions that will include:
*      a detailed assessment of how socio-economic policies affect the conservation of
management of biodiversity at the international, national, regional and local levels;
*      an institutional framework to adequately formulate a sound legal foundation, and to
allocate, use (in relation to carrying capacity), manage, and regulate natural resource
use;
*      an identification and evaluation of the principal elements of the strategy, specifying
the main criteria for policy and investment selection;
*      a proposal for the reconciliation of the needs of local communities with the needs to
protect the environment; and
*      a detailed action plan.
62.    Biodiversity Data Base System. The preparation of the National Biodiversity Strategy, as well
as the whole host of programs suggested in the Action Plan will require adequate information and
data. Today there is plenty of information available on the state of natural resources, which because
of an ineffective institutional structure, is not accessible to policy makers. This is due to at least two
factors: absence of networks whereby the scientific community can participate in decision-making,
and lack of adequate reporting systems that are suitable and user friendly for policy makers. In this
respect, the Government has requested assistance to indicate the necessary mechanisms for a database
system on biodiversity. It is expected that the data system will continue performing its role after the
biodiversity strategy is prepared within the 18 months of this program.
63.    Economic Evaluation of Biodiversity. Given the scarcity of public and private funds, there
is no doubt that biodiversity programs will be scrutinized very thoroughly at the national and regional



86                                                          Environmental Management Project
levels. Central to this scrutiny is the financial and economic valuation of biodiversity investment and
policy reforms. These will be subject to benefit-cost analysis and the Government has requested
assistance to prepare guidelines on this matter.
64.    Workshop on Biodiversity Economics. The Government has recognized the need to put
together a workshop dealing specifically with the economic aspects of biodiversity conservation and
management. A central aspect of that workshop will be to deal with the impact of policy and
investment decision making on biodiversity and establish the basis for future action plan and
investment reviews. In addition, the workshop will be instrumental in providing the first step in
formulation of the national biodiversity strategy. The workshop will bring together scientists, policy-
makers and donors and establish the key elements of the future policy dialogue in the area of
biodiversity and economic development. The terms of reference for the biodiversity strategy and the
original outline will be submitted to this workshop for review and approval. In this regard, the
workshop will also serve as the first public form for the working group on biodiversity that will be
in charge of defying the national strategy.
2. Nature Protection Sub-Component
65.    The principal objectives of this subcomponent are to:
*      Strengthen the institutional arrangements by which protected areas are governed and
administered through the review and reform of the administrative and organizational
structures and processes, i.e., an Institutional Support Program. This necessarily has
to include the development of a strategic framework for strengthening the entire
protected area network in Russia. In addition, it would identify "gaps" in the system
and thereby initiate the basis for the future development of Russia's protected area
systems.
i      Develop an ongoing training program and facilities for protected area administrators
and managers through which the skills and knowledge necessary for effective and
efficient protected area planning and management will be upgraded and simultaneously
dispersed throughout Russia.
*      Sustain the existing federal protected areas through the immediate provision of
carefully selected requirements that are essential for natural resource protection (i.e.,
an Immediate Operations Assistance Program).
66.   Institutional Program.  This sub-component will assist the Government in a legislative,
regulatory and policy review as well as an organizational and efficiency review of the system of
protected areas. Specifically to:
*      assist the Ministry to draft the supporting regulatory and field management polices to
implement the new legislation. The study would identify the inconsistencies, areas
in which policies are at cross purposes or contradictory, and design new policy
instruments to fill the identified gaps (including mechanisms to finance the on-going
management of the system and develop coordinated strategic programs for
environmental education and interpretation);



Annex 2                                                                                   87
*      conduct an appraisal of the actual roles of the existing protected area designations
based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and develop a
desired vision for all protected areas as part of an identified system as above;
*      undertake a review of existing administrative and organizational structures and
processes, including staffing, particularly at the site level, to improve upon their
efficiency and effectiveness.
67.    Training Program.  The development of training facilities and appropriate curricula in
protected area planning and management will result in tangible, transferable, and long-term benefits.
Several tasks will be implemented including:
*      the development of a training program comprised of several modules to enhance, and
disperse the skills and knowledge that are essential for improving the planning and
management of protected areas. This will require an initial study which should
address in detail, matters such as:  specific training needs (at entry, skill and
professional development levels), numbers and qualifications and sources of
instructions personnel, logistical requirements, instruction methods, numbers and
positions of personnel to attend, internal costs, times of training, and training
evaluation procedures:
support for priority training needs; and
the establishment of training centers at locations to be determined, either in a
Regional, or national context following the assessment of needs from the study above.
68.    Immediate Assistance Program. The immediate operations assistance program will enable
a rapid improvement in the protection and operation of the existing protected areas by alleviating key
constraints to their effective management and underpin the system of reserves in the short term. To
accomplish this, a range of immediate investments is required to upgrade their current management
capability. These investments include:
*      Provision of essential means of transport (boats, patrol and heavy goods vehicles),
communications (computer fax/modems including software, E-mail and radio
systems), office equipment and resource protection tools that are crucial for effective
operations and management. Currently, these essential management resources are
either non-existent, inadequate or broken down.
*      Provision of computer equipment and software is essential for improving information
management and decision-making, and thus for the effective management of protected
areas. A wealth of information exists on many of the protected areas. Much of this
information, however, is currently unwieldy. Equipment is lacking and a number of
sites suffer from a shortage of electricity for lack of access to transmission lines or
lack of functioning diesel generators. This activity constrains operational efficiency
and scope. Procurement of generators and fuel supply will be provided.
*      Provision and/or upgrading of key infrastructure, such as small headquarters
buildings, is required for protected area management and operations. At present,
almost without exception, the existing infrastructure is severely deficient in terms of
meeting the basic standards and requirements for effective operations and



88                                                          Environmental Management Project
management.   Consequently, it is critically important to invest in essential
infrastructure in the most needy protected areas.
69.    All the activities in the immediate assistance sub-component have been reviewed with senior
Russian protected area administrators and managers and have been subjected to field verification. The
criteria used for evaluating the requirements of the protected areas included an assessment of
pressures, biodiversity values, management effectiveness, the state of existing infrastructure, transport
and communications, and income generation capabilities.
3. Lake Baikal Program
70.    While the Strategic Overview formulates the general policy, the Regional Program enables its
acceptance and provides an invaluable trial of its implementation by working through inter-regional,
regional and immediate financial assistance components.
71.    Lake Baikal of itself provides compelling reasons for assistance, while fulfilling the criteria
for the regional pilot natural resource management action plan. It has an outstanding representation
of species, many of which are endemic and threatened, contains 20 percent of the world's fresh-water,
includes three Zapovedniki (two of which are biosphere Reserves) and two National Parks, has a
significant industrial, urban and tourist sector and has suffered the consequences of deleterious
regional agricultural and forestry management. It is of such vital international importance that it
requires immediate support even under the Immediate Assistance Program described above. The
project will address institutional, ethnic and social impacts of biodiversity in the two regions of Irkutsk
and Chita and the Republic of Buriatia. It represents an unique opportunity to test alternative
organizational arrangements at the regional and local levels.
72.   It provides an initial model of integrated natural resources management with the integration
of social, economic, institutional, and sectorial issues.  This is central to any future nature
protection/environment project and is particularly relevant in view of the inter-agency and inter-
ministerial coordination that will be required. It will be a testing ground for the identification, design
and evaluation of the regulatory environment confronting biodiversity and nature protection activities.
Regulation at the regional level is evolving and many of the implementation mechanisms are either
ad hoc or relatively new. The principal vehicle for integration will be land-use programs and it is of
critical importance to gauge how effective such a vehicle will prove, especially in relation to the
accompanying economic instruments.
73.    The Lake Baikal Program considers three major areas of intervention: inter-regional, regional
(individual oblast/republic) level, and immediate assistance for sustainable development. Each has
multiple components which are presented below.
74.   Interventions on the Inter-Regional Level. The project includes five interventions to improve
natural resource management at the inter-regional level. These are:
0      Natural Resource Management Strategy. Formulation and implementation of a
strategy for the region, considering the ecological, economic, social and institutional
aspects in managing of natural resources. The strategy will pay attention to resource-
based problems, i.e., using natural resources as the unit of analysis, and to the
sectorial and cross-sectorial issues, constraints and options. Use will be made of
existing studies and experiences (e.g., land use planning). Policies, investments and
institutional reforms will be selected within the format of an action plan that would



Annex 2                                                                                            89
benefit all regions involved.  The strategy will be central to the attainment of
sustainable development, particularly as it relates to land and water based
ecosystems'9'.
*      Assessment of Sources of Growth and Comparative Advantage.  Given the
development imperatives facing the regions and the challenges associated with the
conservation and management of natural resources, an assessment of the real
comparative advantage of the Lake Baikal region will be undertaken. The main
difference with traditional assessments in this area will be its emphasis on the proper
valuation of natural resources involved in potentially viable economic activities (e.g.,
the full opportunity cost of each resource involved). The assessment will also be
instrumental in defining a system of regional accounts that will include the full set of
values of natural resources and goods. Options and alternatives will be evaluated and
disseminated through workshops and seminars. Existing public investment and
expenditure plans will be revised in light of the main conclusions of this assessment.
*      Information Systems and Monitoring and Evaluation.  Proper management of
natural resources requires adequate information and data for decision making.
Experience demonstrates that the "quality of entry" of many projects and programs
is at present very low and thus, their probability of success rather slim. While there
appears to be no shortage of data and information about the natural systems prevailing
in the Lake Baikal region (including information on relevant economic/social
indicators of development performance), there are significant institutional constraints;
i.e., the way in which data flow to decision-makers (quality, timing, format). The
project will assist in overcoming those constraints.
e      Environmental Assessment:  Guidelines and Procedures.  There are different
environmental standards applied across different regions, with enforcement
mechanisms and procedures which are clearly inadequate. Significant differentials in
environmental standards create notable changes in resource allocation and the rate at
which renewable and non-renewable resources are being consumed. Specifically,
some areas could become pollution heavens or the center of major depletion of such
resources as soil and forests. Because of the potentially damaging effects of resource
misallocations, e.g., expansion of polluting industries where the standards are more
lax and of the inevitable ecological and economic linkages across regions (through
common watersheds and river basins, shared underground water aquifers, air pollution
and acid rain) a major harmonization of environmental standards is needed. In
addition, environmental guidelines must be issued and applied at the level of
development planning where investments, policies and institutional reforms are chosen
to attain sustainable developmentm'
*      Institutional Development, Education  and  Training.   The development and
enhancement of institutions is greatly needed if natural resource management is to be
improved.   Increased institutional absorptive capacity will take several forms,
including the development of legal frameworks and institutions, e.g., property rights,
19/ This project will pay particular attention to fisheries development and management and to wildlife management and hunting. These are
two aras of significant ecological and economical importance in the Lake Baikal region.
20/ The project will give special attention to mining methods and land reclamation issues as a result of mining operations. The guidelines and
procedures should explicitly include these reclamation activities given the proximity of profitable mines to the Lake Baikal shores.



90                                                         Environmental Management Project
rules and regulations, the establishment of the necessary organizational arrangements
for the successful implementation of development activities and the creation of the
necessary mechanisms for the participation and consultation of communities, NGOs
and indigenous people. Central to this process is the enhancement of human capital
at all levels, through education and training programs. These programs should be
tailored for different groups and needs. In some cases, public awareness-related
discussions will be recommended. In other cases, needs may be associated to the
comprehensive development of curricula on the subject matter of natural resource
management -- from primary school to the end of the university education.
75.   Interventions at the Regional Level. The interventions presented below will be implemented
in Irkutsk, Chita and the Republic of Buritia. The framework and implementation approaches of these
interventions will be similar for each region. However, the detailed design and the setting of
implementation priorities will respond to the conditions in each region. In all cases, the main
objective will be to implement the proposed pilot operations, test approaches, consolidate and
disseminate (i.e., through an adequate extension service) those natural resource interventions that are
effective and sustainable, and to establish the foundation for future expansions into more sizable
investments and institutional development programs. The project includes three pilot programs of
critical regional importance. These programs are assigned to the following areas:
*     Fire Forest Prevention. Forest fires have proven to be one of the major problems
in forest management during the summer (harvest) season. It has been estimated that
4.5 million hectares are destroyed every year in Siberia. Fire hazard is the number
one problem in the Baikal region and, consequently, the prevention of forest fires has
become a top regional priority. The pilot operations will promote emergency
investments into fire prevention and fire fighting in high priority areas. A local fire
specialist will be identified and supported (training and operation) during the course
of project implementation.
There are several other forestry related initiatives that this project is prepared to
finance. These initiatives will include: as institutional improvements; policy analysis
and change; and technology improvements. In the area of technology improvement
technical assistance will be allocated to areas such as wood production, harvesting,
transport and processing. The up-grading of information systems will also be
considered.
*     Watershed Management and Sustainable Development. The regional governments
have given special attention to the development of watershed management programs
that are characterized by environmental fragility, poverty, or both. The development
challenges are particularly acute in several areas, and ecological sustainable
interventions need to be found. The pilot programs will cover several development
and management dimensions, including agriculture, forestry, irrigation, and livestock
development. On the resource management side, these programs will pay particular
attention to soil and water management, pasture improvement, changes in agricultural
practices, soil erosion control and sedimentation management, and the like. The
selection of the watersheds has been such that the replicability effects may be
maximized in the future.
*     Ecotourism Development. The regional governments have all given high priority to
ecotourism. This priority has been justified on ecological, economic and social



Annex 2                                                                               91
grounds. While some forms of ecotourism are taking place near the Lake Baikal, it
remains to be demonstrated that this activity is profitable and sustainable in the longer
term. Funds for project preparation have already been allocated, and it is expected
that the major question surrounding a significant expansion of ecotourism activities
will be addressed in detail to avoid misallocation of scarce resources or the creation
of ecological and social stress in the Lake Baikal region.
0     Information Systems for Selected Project Components.  Information and
monitoring and evaluation systems will be designed for a selected number of activities
included in the protected areas and Lake Baikal sub-components. With regard to the
Lake Baikal Program, the emphasis will be on watershed management, forestry
inventories, and fisheries management. The scope and content of those efforts will
be directly proportional to their pilot scale. Expansion of that scale will be considered
as a second stage in the process of project implementations.
*     Immediate Assistance for Sustainable Development. A special component will be
created to benefit natural resource management related activities, particularly those
directly linked to traditional systems, communities, women groups, NGOs and
indigenous groups. These activities will strengthen NRM at all levels. The allocation
of financial resources available from this component will be carried out following five
main categories. These are:
*     Community Development Activities. To promote such activities as "backyard
farming", livestock raising or harvesting of minor forest products, e.g.,
berries, nuts, honey. All of them are influencing the management of such
resources as forest, land and vegetation.
*     NGOs' Development and Conservation Programs.  Examples of these
activities are tree planting programs, fisheries management and aquaculture,
and soil conservation.
*     NRM  Activities and Indigenous People. Enhancement of NRM  in areas
where most indigenous people live, based on traditional and indigenous
approaches and practices in NRM. Examples include the preservation and
effective utilization of medicinal plants and livestock raising and rearing in
areas where soil erosion rates are relatively high.
*     Policy and Applied Research in NRM. Funds will be allocated into the
research community, i.e., natural science research as well as social science
research, to bring practical and proven methods and procedures into public
policy making.
*     Short Term  Training.   International Consulting  and Private Sector
Development. Funds will be allocated for short term training courses or
consultants in such areas as Benefit-Cost Analysis of Environmental Goods
and Services, and consultation on specialized issues regarding public
expenditures and investment reviews.
76.   While it is not possible to specify all the necessary criteria for selection of projects to be
funded by the component, several of these are worth noting: the funds are to be allocated to tasks and



92                                                         Environmental Management Project
activities that are definitely linked to natural resources and environmental management; the funds
should be approved, based on a written statement of a task or a project for the Baikal region. A copy
of a written statement of tasks to be financed from the component must be supplied to the Bank; the
use of consultants (local and international) must be explicitly acknowledged; the funds should not be
used disproportionately for a few activities.
77.   However, because of the experimental nature of the Immediate Assistance for Sustainable
Development component, several activities have been already earmarked for implementation, such as
emergency financing in the areas of fishing and wildlife management; research on medicinal plants
that will, in turn, enhance the Indo-Tibetan Medicine Program in the Republic of Buritia; and
environmental-ecological extension servicing the watersheds; short and medium term credit for
agriculture and land management related purposes; investment cum technical assistance program for
backyard farming "cottage" industries in the Ust Barguizin area; and community based programs
managed or executed by NGOs.
G.    Cultural and Natural Heritage Conservation and Management
78.   The Conservation and Management of Cultural and Natural Heritage (MCNH) are an
important national objective of GOR, and the ability to attain that objective depends significantly on
economic social and environmental policies/reforms in other sectors of the economy. It is this set of
linkages that justifies the incorporation of a MCNH component within the Overall Framework TA
Program. Other framework activities with potentially significant linkages with the MCNH are: air
quality management, water quality management, hazardous waste management and policy and
regulatory support.
79.   In the midst of the great changes that are taking place in Russia today, cultural and natural
heritage is increasingly threatened by lack of adequate funding, human resources and management.
Several policies oriented towards growth and development have profound effects on the government's
and community's ability to preserve the cultural and natural heritage of the country. These effects are
transmitted through important changes in land use, air and water quality, budget allocation at the
national and regional levels, and the like. It is, therefore, opportune to assist the government in the
preparation of a national and regional framework and in the implementation of a set of priority
activities to ensure conservation and a better utilization of cultural and natural heritage.
80.   The proposed MCNH  component will consider cultural and natural heritage in the
environmental management context. The program will emphasize major linkages between policies,
investments and institutional reforms to enhance environmental and natural resource management and
the conservation and management of cultural assets. Within this context, initial activities will review
the current situation of cultural heritage and identify the major issues confronting cultural and natural
heritage conservation. Based on this analysis, the MCNH component will assess the main policy
options and their implications and provide a preliminary assessment of financial and technical
assistance needs. It would aim at strengthening existing programs, initiating new pilot activities, and
laying the foundations for later reforms.
81.   The MCNH component will include three major areas: (i) Policy and Regulatory Support;
(ii) Institution Building and Strengthening of Management and Implementation Mechanisms; and (iii)
a National Fund for MCNH.
82.   Policy and Regulatory Support. This activity will assess present policies that affect the
conservation and maintenance of cultural and natural heritage assets.  Chief among these are



Annex 2                                                                                      93
environmental policies in regard to air, water and natural resource protection, the siting of industry,
and waste disposal. Examples of other policies with direct impacts on heritage are land use in urban
and rural areas, building control, budgetary and fiscal policies with regard to resources allocated to
research institutes, museums, historic structures, and archaeological, natural and sacred sites, and
institutional roles and relationships.
83.    It is clear that in Russia today there are key policy and institutional areas where adjustments
are needed in order to create a climate conducive to adequate protection of the heritage: (i) the legal
and regulatory framnework; (ii) the management of heritage assets; (iii) institutional coordination; and
(iv) management of public finances. The component project will aim to make phased improvements
in each of these areas.
84.    The legal system should provide a set of rules that govern the protection of cultural and natural
property and property rights and their exchange. Some of the areas for legislative review and revision
include land use planning and control, building standards, municipal zoning laws, protected areas and
nature reserves which include cultural heritage assets, and regulations concerning the export of and
trade in antiquities.
85.    InstitutionBuilding and Strengthening of Management and Implementation. Consistent with
the main thrust of the framnework program, this activity will emphasize management as a central
function in the conservation of cultural and natural heritage. Management in this instance will be
mainly concerned with the allocation, use, maintenance, control, regulation, and sustainability of
cultural assets. To strengthen the management fuinctions and component will assist in the formulation
of a national strategy; assessment of existing programs and needs at the national, regional and local
levels; harmonization of existing preservation and management standards; and development of
informnation systems and monitoring and evaluation.
86.    In addition, the component would support pilot projects and training activities. The pilot
projects would be chosen to represent thematic and structural typologies. Among these would be:
(i) the management of archaeological sites, including site interpretation and presentation; (ii) the
conservation of historic wooden structures; (iii) climate control and collection management in
museums; and (iv) guidelines for the reuse of important historic structures.
87.    The analysis of investment and TA needs would lead to the preparation of selected studies and
training courses. These would include:
*      studies to design a nation-wide inventory of cultural heritage, aiming at maximum
efficiency and user-friendliness;
*      training programs for Russian staff in site management;
*      studies to modernize and strengthen the financial capabilities of Russian institutions
responsible for safeguarding her-itage; and
*      studies and training to strengthen local goverrnments and public administration to plan
for heritage conservation.
88.    National Fund for the MCNH.  The fund will constitute the instrument through which
inmportant cultural heritage and natural conservation and management activities will be financed.



94                                                         Environmental Management Project
These activities may be pilot operations, the implementation of inter-regional programs and inter-
regional cooperation, or the financing of community-based activities.
89.   The rules and regulations defining the allocation, use, control, and audit of funds would be
consistent with funds set up under other World Bank projects.

RUSSLAN FEDERATION
ENVMRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
ANNEX 3.1
POLICY AND REGULATORY SUPPORT
COMPONENT DESCRIPTION
A.    Background
1.     An overall framework of technical assistance priorities in environmental management was
developed jointly by the MEPNR, USG, the Canadian Government and the World Bank through a
series of missions from October 1992 to December 1993. A central element of this framework was
the need to strengthen the capacity to develop and implement environmental policies, in particular at
the federal and regional levels of government2L. It was agreed that particular attention should be given
to:
*      enhancing the capacity to set environmental priorities and to design policies to address
these priorities at federal and regional levels of government;
*      improving the system for monitoring environmental conditions and link the collection
of environmental data to the development and implementation of specific plans to
address the most serious environmental problems;
*      developing an effective legal and institutional framework for environmental
management including the capacity to formulate and enforce regulations, to coordinate
the activities of different agencies and levels of government, and to respond to public
concerns about environmental damage; and
*      ensuring that environmental policies and management practices take account of
external social, economic and technical changes by developing an integrated approach
to environmental quality and resource management and by working with economic
policymakers, enterprises and other institutions to ensure that environmental
considerations are properly taken into account in economic policies, as well as
investment and other decisions.
2.     This component has been designed to address these priorities. It emphasizes an integrated
approach to environmental management at regional and sectoral level by focusing on activities which
combine data collection, policy and regulatory development, implementation and enforcement. The
different skills -- technical, legal, economic and managerial -- that are required to ensure an effective
system of management are combined in the design of the component rather than being separated into
other components of the EMP and of the overall Framework Program.
3.     From a legal perspective, the new constitution specifies that the management of natural
resources, environmental protection and ecological safety, and nature protection are joint responsibil-
ities of the federal and the regional governments without providing detailed guidance to settle
21/ The terminology for describing sub-national levels of government in Russia is confusing, especially in translation. In the present context
dhe term 'regional' will be used to refer to subjects of federation (autonomous republics, oblasts and okrugs) as well as administrtive oblasts
and krais, or to groups of these units.



Annex 3.1                                                                             97
competing claims for jurisdiction on specific issues. The federal government is responsible for the
fundamental laws which govern natural resources and environmental protection. Thus, a workable
basis for environmental policy-making would give the responsibility for defining the overall priorities,
instruments and framework for environmental management to the federal authorities. Sub-national
authorities would be responsible for strategic planning at a regional level, as well as for the detailed
implementation and enforcement of policies and the allocation of financial resources.
4.     As a result, the central element of the Policy and Regulatory Support component will be the
elaboration and implementation of regional and sectoral environmental action plans for a small number
of highly polluted regions or of sectors responsible for disproportionate amounts of environmental
damage. The regions and sectors selected for this component overlap, so that measures to improve
the environmental performance of particular sectors will make a large contribution to reducing
environmental damage in the regions concerned. The process will strengthen regional capabilities to
formulate, implement and enforce environmental policies and regulations. For both practical and legal
reasons, long term progress towards the broad objective of reducing the environmental damage caused
to Russia's population and ecosystems will depend upon on an effective system of collaboration
between federal and regional levels of governmnent. The example of and lessons learnt during the
implementation of the subcomponent projects will provide a model that can be gradually extended
throughout the country. At the same time, the sectoral environmental action plans should benefit all
localities which are currently affected by the poor environmental performance of these sectors.
5.     A crucial characteristic of the EMP is that all of the components are designed to achieve
concrete changes in the policies, procedures or practices of environmental management which will
directly or indirectly lead to improvements in environmental conditions within a period of 3-4 years.
This is linked to the focus on federal-regional collaboration because the involvement of regional
authorities will be essential to turn policy and other initiatives into practical measures. While it is
difficult to set up criteria for judging the achievements of each of the activities in advance, the
successes and failures of the project and of this component must ultimately be judged by the extent
to which it has reduced the exposure of the population and of ecosystems to environmental damage.
B.    Objectives
6.     The principal objective of the policy and regulatory component is both simple and ambitious.
It is to achieve a significant reduction in environmental damage in the Urals and Upper Volga regions
within a period of 3-5 years with a particular focus on the impact of industrial pollution on human
health. The specific targets for reducing pollution cannot be set until the initial work of assessing the
scale of environmental damage and setting priorities has been carried out. However, they should
encompass reductions of up to 25 percent in ambient exposure to air pollutants such as lead,
particulates and toxic hydrocarbons, and to water pollutants such as heavy metals and toxic organic
compounds as well as bacteriological contamination of drinking water.
7.     The regions covered by the two regional activities will depend upon the willingness of the
regional authorities to cooperate with the project and to commit the required counterpart resources for
the implementation of the regional environmental action plans from their environment funds. The
regions of Chelyabinsk, Penn and Sverdlovsk will form the core of the Urals regional project with
the possible participation of the Bashkir Republic and the south-western part of Tyumen oblast. The
regions of Vologda and Yaroslavl will form the core of the Upper Volga regional project. The two
regions have been chosen to overlap with the regional activities being financed under the Hazardous
Waste and Water Quality Management components of the EMP, so as to promote an integrated
approach to environmental management. These regions are also the focus of the regional work to be



98                                                         Environmental Management Project
carried out under the Environmental Epidemiology component.  The process of assessing
environmental conditions and setting priorities will rely substantially on the work to be undertaken by
the Regional Environmental Epidemiology Units. Later, the monitoring of the impact of the
environmental measures adopted in the two regions will focus especially on tracking the health status
of sensitive groups of children and workers.
8.    The component has two subsidiary objectives
*     To develop the capacity to set environmental priorities, to formulate, implement and
enforce environmental policies, and to monitor environment conditions at federal, and
regional levels through a set of demonstration activities which can be gradually
extended to cover the whole country.
*     To establish the administrative, economic, legal and technical basis for reaching
negotiated agreements to reduce emissions from specific industries or in a particular
region over a period of years as the key element in a longer term approach to
reducing industrial pollution in Russia over the next 5-10 years.
9.     The achievement of these subsidiary objectives would provide a basis for ensuring continuing
improvements in environmental conditions both in the Urals and Upper Volga regions and in the rest
of the country by application of the approaches, policies and regulatory instruments developed in the
course of the project. Thus, the component would contribute to the ultimate objective of ensuring that
economic recovery and development in Russia is accompanied by reductions in environmental damage
rather than by worsening environmental conditions as in the past.
C.    Activities and Outputs
10.   The main focus of the activities to be undertaken in the Policy and Regulatory component will
gradually shift from the federal level to the regional level over the course of the project. The first
step will be the establishment of a Federal Environmental Policy Unit which will be responsible for
the initial training activities, for updating the National Environmental Action Plan, for developing the
legal and regulatory framework required to implement negotiated agreements for environmental
improvement, and for the first stage of the studies required to prepare Sectoral Environmental Action
Plans.
11.   Regional Environmental Policy Units will be established in the Urals and Upper Volga regions
-- based in Ekaterinburg and Yaroslavl respectively. The work program of these units will focus
initially upon preparing an assessment of regional environmental conditions and on establishing
environmental priorities on a regional and an obla&st basis. Then, with assistance from the sectoral
studies, they will draw up Regional Environmental Action Plans whose implementation will provide
the focus for the core work of the component.
12.   After the first year of the project the main attention of the Federal Unit will be on providing
support for the implementation and the extension of environmental policy initiatives under the Regional
Environmental Action Plans. Staff who have been working in the Federal Unit for an initial period
of training will return to work in the Regional Units, while legal, policy and sectoral specialists
employed by the Federal Unit will be seconded for periods to work in the Regional Units. To reduce
barriers between federal and regional policymakers and to ensure that experience in one region can
be shared with other regions all staff employed in the Federal Unit -- other than the Project Manager



Annex 3.1                                                                          99
and the team leaders -- will be required to spend at least 18 months seconded to one of the Regional
Units working on the implementation of local environmental action plans.
13.   Federal Environmental Policy Unit. This Unit will be established as an independent unit
reporting to and servicing the recently-established Commission on the Environment. This Commission
has been established by the Federal Council of Ministers to oversee the activities of a variety of
Ministries and State Committees whose responsibilities cover environmental and natural resource
management. Membership of the Commission includes the Ministry of Environrnental Protection and
Natural Resources, the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Forestry Service, and the State Committees
for Hydro-Meteorology, Sanitary-Epidemiological Surveillance, and Geology, as well as the Ministries
of Economy and Finance. The Commission is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for
agricultural, environmental and natural resource issues. It represents the channel by which proposals
from individual Ministries and State Committees concerning environmental and natural resource issues
will be routed to the Council of Ministers for decision and execution. Since the original concept of
creating a single Ministry to cover all environmental and natural resource issues has been undermined
by the successful assertion of independence by various agencies, the Commission represents the best
framework for developing a coherent approach to environmental policymaking at the federal level.
14.   The activities of the Federal Unit will be divided between three teams: (a) a federal policy
team; (b) a regional policy team; and (c) a sectoral policy team. The federal policy teamn will be
responsible for:
*     the construction and maintenance of a database on ambient environmental conditions
and on major emission sources throughout the country;
*     the preparation of regular assessments of the extent of and trends in environmental
damage in different regions;
*     recommending priorities for federal environmental policies and activities which take
account of the damage to human health and to ecosystems caused by pollution, natural
resource use and other causes;
*     reviewing and updating the National Environmental Action Plan at regular intervals
in the light of changing environmental conditions and priorities;
*     developing the economic, legal and institutional framnework for the implementation of
federal environmental policies and regulations;
*     assisting in the development of the legal and institutional basis for environmental
impact assessment (EIA) and of a review mechanism to ensure that the quality and
effectiveness of EIA is maintained;
*     monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of federal environmental policies and
drawing up recommendations for changes designed to enhance their impact or to take
account of new information or changing circumstances;
*     working with non-environmental ministries and agencies to ensure that the environ-
mental consequences and costs of measures adopted by those bodies are taken fully
into account when decisions on economic policies, investments and other matters are
made;



100                                                         Environmental Management Project
*      developing a training strategy to enhance the knowledge and skills in environmental
management of staff working in federal, regional and local environmental bodies;
*      managing training courses in environmental law and environmental policy for staff
recruited to work in the Federal and Regional Units as well as workshops to
disseminate the results of experience gained during the project to regional and local
environmental officials throughout the country; and
*      providing technical assistance support to the NPAF for project feasibility studies and
project appraisals.
15.    The role of the regional team will be to coordinate and support the work being undertaken in
the Regional Environmental Policy Units to develop and implement policies to address local
environmental priorities. It will also be responsible for working with other regional governments to
develop environmental policy initiatives drawing upon the model provided by the project. The core
work of the team -- like that of the Regional Units -- will focus on achieving environmental
improvements in the two demonstration regions by a process of setting appropriate goals for
environmental policy and designing environmental measures which can implemented through a
combination of incentives, regulations, and investments involving negotiated agreements with industrial
enterprises and other bodies responsible for major emission sources in each of the two regions.
16.    The sectoral team will be responsible for drawing up and implementing Sectoral Environmental
Action Plans for 6 heavily polluting sectors with a primary focus on sources located in the
demonstration regions. The sectors to be covered by the team will be
*      iron and steel;
*     non-ferrous metals;
*     oil refining and petrochemicals;
-      basic organic and inorganic chemicals;
*      pulp and paper2-'; and
*      agriculture with a particular focus on intensive livestock operations.
17.   It is expected that work on the forestry sector will be financed from bilateral sources under
the auspices of other Bank sector work. The sectoral team will provide technical and other support
to the Regional Units to assist in the implementation of the Sectoral Environmental Action Plans within
the Urals and the Upper Volga regions. It will also assist other regional environmental authorities to
implement the Sectoral Plans by reaching negotiated agreements on emission reductions as well as
environmental quality and natural resource management issues with major enterprises and
organizations falling under their supervision. In addition this team will provide technical assistance
support to the National Pollution Abatement Facility for project feasibility studies and project
appraisals.
22/ The first phase of this sectoral study is being funded by the Finnish government.



Annex 3.1                                                                          10t
18.   The teams within the Federal Environmental Policy Unit define the functional responsibilities
of the unit, but as an organization it will operate according to matrix structure. Individual members
of staff will not assigned rigidly to one of the teams but will be expected to contribute to a variety of
tasks which may be managed by different teams. The combined skills of lawyers, economists and
policy specialists will be required for the work to be undertaken by all three teams, but the balance
between these skills will change over time and according to circumstances. Thus, a rigid vertical
structure would be both inefficient and would inhibit the sharing of experience which will be a crucial
element in ensuring that the component serves as an effective demonstration project in environmental
management.
19.   The outputs of the Federal Environmental Policy Unit will include
*     a regular assessment of the extent and trends in environmental damage in different
parts of the country;
*     an updated National Environmental Action Plan which should contain (a) a clear set
of environmental priorities with targets for environmental improvements to be
achieved within a 3-5 year period, and (b) recommendations for policies, regulatory
actions, institutional measures, and investments designed to meet these targets in a
cost-effective manner;
*     at least 6 Sectoral Environmental Action Plans which should focus on identifying a
set of low cost nieasures designed to reduce each sector's emissions of the key
pollutants up to 25 percent over 3-5 years together with programs for implementing
these measures in order to meet the emissions reduction targets;
*     recommendations and drafts of policies, legislation and regulations required to ensure
successful implementation of the National, Regional and Sector Environmental Action
Plans;
*     policy assessments, position papers and recommendations concerning the impact of
general economic and fiscal policies on pollution, natural resource use and other
environmental concerns; and
*     interim reviews and a final evaluation of the achievements of the component together
with recommendations for mechanisms to apply the lessons learned in the course of
the EMP to environmental management at the federal level and in regions throughout
the country.
20.   These outputs will be important indicators of the work being undertaken by the Federal
Environmental Policy Unit. Nonetheless, they will only be inputs to meeting the main goal of the
component which is to ensure that there is a significant improvement in the environmental quality
enjoyed by the Russian population over the length of the project.
21.   Regional Environmental Policy Units. For each region an Inter-Regional Environmental
Council either has or will be established. These will advise and supervise the work of the Regional
Environmental Policy Units. Each unit will cooperate with the regional authorities with environmental
responsibilities -- including the regional branches of federal Ministries and State Committees, regional
administrations and the Environment Committees of regional parliaments.



102                                                        Environmertal Management Project
22.   The primary task for the Regional Units will be to draft, obtain approval for and oversee the
implementation of Regional Environmental Action Plans for each of the regiol Ls in the demonstration
regions. Carrying out this task will involve:
*     the collection and analysis of data on ambient environmental conditions and on major
emission sources;
*     the preparation of regular assessments of the extent of and trends in environmental
damage;
*     coordinating work on data collection and the assessment of environmen:al conditions
with the Regional Envi:onmental Epidemiology Units;
*     recommending priorities for regional environmental policies and activities which take
account of the damage to human health -- based, as far as possible, on the regional
epidemiological work -- and to ecosystems caused by pollution, natural resource use
and other causes;
*     preparation of the Regional Environmental Action Plans and updating them at regular
intervals in the light of changing environmental conditions and priorities;
*     providing support for the detailed implementation of federal environmental policies
and regulations at regional level;
*     advising on the level, assessment and collection of emission charges and on the
allocation of resources from regional and local environment funds
*     reviewing and recommending changes to "temporary" emission permits for enterprises
which operate in localities where ambient concentrations of pollutants exceed the
target levels set in the Regional Environmental Action Plans;
*     negotiating agreements with major emission sources to achieve phased reductions in
emissions over the period of the project;
*     assisting the implementation and enforcement of regional environmental policies;
*     providing policy and regulatory support to the regional activities of the Water Quality
and Hazardous Waste components of the EMP;
*     monitoring the effectiveness of environmental measures and drawing up recommenda-
tions for changes designed to enhance their impact or to take account of new
information or changing circumstances;
*     working with regional administrations, industrial enterprises, and NGOs to ensure that
the enviromnental consequences and costs of measures adopted by those bodies are
taken fully into account when decisions on economic policies, investments and other
matters are made.



Annex 3.1                                                                          103
23.   In essence, the work of the Regional Units will proceed in four phases.
*     During the first 6 months of their full operation they will focus on a rapid assessment
of environmental conditions in their regions and will draw up a preliminary set of
environmental priorities and targets for environmental improvement.
*     In months 7-12 these priorities and targets will be reviewed and agreed by all of the
interested parties with the results of these discussions being embodied in the Regional
Environmental Action Plans.
*     In months 13-24 the initial actions identified in the Regional Environmental Action
Plans will be implemented while the Regional Units will concentrate on the process
of negotiating agreements on emission reductions with major polluters. This will
involve the adoption of a carrot and stick approach with the carrot being assistance
from regional and local c-ivironment ftnds and the stick being the revocation of
"temporary" emission permits and the imposition of economic or regulatory sanctions
for breaches of the stricter standard emission norms.
*     In months 25-48 the full implementation of the Regional Environmental Action Plans
and of the negotiated emission reduction agreements will proceed and will be
monitored for their impact on environmental conditions. As appropriate, Regional
Environmental Action Plans will be updated in the final year of the project while the
sectors and enterprises covered by negotiated agreements will be extended to include
a larger number of medium-sized emission sources, as well as pollutants which were
not covered by the first round of agreements.
24.   Some staggering of this timetable for individual oblasts within each region will be required
in order to avoid putting undue demands on the resources of the Regional Units. The phasing will
be determined in the light of the initial assessment of regional environmental conditions and priorities.
Taking account of the overlapping timetables for the individual regions and regions, the main demand
for support from the regional and sectoral teams in the Federal Environmental Policy Unit will be
from months 12 to 36 as the Regional Units implement phases (ii), (iii) and the early part of phase
(iv) in the regions for which they are responsible.
25.   The outputs of the Regional Environmental Policy Units will include
*     regular assessments of the extent and trends in environmental damage in the two
regions;
*     Regional Environmental Action Plans which should contain (a) a clear set of
environmental priorities with targets for environmental improvements to be achieved
within a 3-5 year period, and (b) recommendations for policies, regulatory actions,
institutional measures, and investments designed to meet these targets in a cost-
effective manner;
*     negotiated agreements with major pollution sources to reduce emissions by up to 25
percent in a phased manner over a period of 3-5 years in order to meet the
environmental quality targets defined in the Regional Environmental Action Plans;



104                                                              Environmental Management Project
*      recommendations and drafts of policies, regulations and permit revisions required to
ensure successful implementation of the Regional and Sector Environmental Action
Plans;
*      interim  reviews and a final evaluation of the progress made in meeting the
environmental goals of the regional activities together with recommendations for
sustaining and extending environmental gains.
26.    As in the case of the Federal Environmental Policy Unit, these outputs are to be regarded as
intermediate steps in the process of enhancing environmental quality in the Urals and Upper Volga
regions.
D.     Implementation Arrangements
27.    The assistance will be provided over a period of 4 years starting in November 1994. The first
4 months of the project will be primarily devoted to providing specialized training courses in
environmental law and environmental policy for the prospective staff of the Federal and Regional
Units as well as on establishing offices and procuring equipment. Thus, the Federal and Regional
Units are expected to start full operation in April 1995.
28.    A  Policy and Regulatory Management Committee will be established by the Federal
Commission  on the Environment to supervise the implementation of the component.   This
Management Committee will include representatives from  the Ministries and State Committees
represented on the Commission, as well as representatives from other economic Ministries such as the
Ministries of Fuel and Energy and of Industry which will either be affected by or should work with
the Federal and Regional Units. Subject to the agreement of the Bank, the Management Committee
will appoint a Project Manager for the Policy and Regulatory Component who will also serve as the
Director of the Federal Environmental Policy Unit.
29.    The Federal and Regional Units will be staffed by Russian experts. The Federal Unit will
have a Director (the Project Manager), a Deputy Director who will be a qualified environmental
lawyerL' and will also act as the Unit's Chief Legal Adviser, and three team leaders for the federal,
regional and sectoral teams. At least 5 of the staff of the Federal Unit will be qualified environmental
lawyers, and a further 5 will have postgraduate qualifications in economics plus training in
environmental economics. The other five members of the unit will have technical qualifications with
a mix of multidisciplinary backgrounds. It will be condition of employment in the professional grades
of the Federal and Regional Units, except for the Director, that individuals must pass either a intensive
2-3 month training course in environmental law or one in environmental policy analysis before they
join the staff.
30.    The Urals Regional Unit will have a Director (at the same level as the team leaders in the
Federal Unit), at least 5 qualified environmental lawyers and 3 staff with postgraduate qualifications
in economics plus training in environmental economics. The Upper Volga Regional Unit will have
a Director, at least 3 qualified environmental lawyers and 2 staff with postgraduate qualifications in
economics plus training in environmental economics. Each of the Regional units will have 2 - 3
highly qualified technical experts.
23/ This context a qualified environmental lawyer is someone with a recognized law degree involving at least [121 semesters of higher education
plus a satisfactory performance in a full-time one semester course on environmental law such as that provided in the training program for
prospective staff.



Annex 3. 1                                                                           105
31.   The Directors and staff of the Federal and Regional Units will be selected according to
competitive procedures that will be established by the CPPI in consultation with the World Bank. The
Policy and Regulatory Management Committee will set up a selection committee for this purpose for
the Federal Units, while the Inter-Regional Environmental Councils will do the same for the Regional
Units for which they are responsible.
32.    A Policy and Regulatory Consultant will be appointed to provide policy advice and to
undertake specific studies during the course of the project. The terms of reference for this contract
will specify an initial set of studies and policy advice as well as an overall level of effort and set of
skills for the remainder of the work to be undertaken. In selecting the consultant a strong preference
will be given to proposals which are based on a team drawing on experience with environmental
policymaking and implementation in several countries with differing legal systems and approaches to
economic incentives and environmental regulations.
33.    The Policy and Regulatory Consultant will nominate and supervise the work of a small group
of independent, high level consultants (the Advisory Group). This Advisory Group will be responsible
for (a) advising the Project Manager on technical aspects of the implementation of the project, (b)
providing policy advice on critical issues, and (c) reviewing the overall progress of the component.
The Advisory Group will contain at least two Legal Advisers and at least two Economic Advisers with
a total membership of 5. It will meet with the Directors and senior staff of the Federal and Regional
Units at regular intervals (3-4 times per year) in order to maintain close contact with the work of these
units. They will also be expected to produce occasional papers or to provide on-the-spot policy advice
on specific issues which arise.  Members of the Advisory Group will be expected to devote
approximately 3 months per year to this task. Continuity of involvement is an essential element of
the role of the Advisory Group, nominees for membership of the Advisory Group will be expected
to commit themselves for the full period of the project, subject, of course, to special or unforeseen
circumstances which may necessitate withdrawal.
34.    The Advisory Group will be required to submit an annual report to the Management
Committee which reviews the work carried out in the previous 12 months and makes
recommendations, as appropriate, for steps required to speed up or enhance the effectiveness of the
work of the Federal and Regional Units.  This report will be submitted as an annex to the
Management Committee's annual review of the progress of the component which will be prepared for
MEPNR and the Bank.
35.   In addition to the Advisory Group two full-time foreign Senior Advisers will be appointed by
the Policy and Regulatory Consultant to assist the Project Manager in implementing the component
at both federal and regional levels. Each will work on the project for a period of two years starting
in July 1995. One of the Senior Advisers will be an environmental lawyer and the other will be an
environmental economist. Both will be expected to have substantial experience in the development
and implementation of environmental policies. Russian language skills will not be a pre-condition of
appointment but non-Russian speakers will be required to undertake an intensive Russian language
course before taking up their posts. The Senior Advisers will be chosen by a selection board including
the Project Manager, Ehe CPPI Director, representatives of the Management Committee and of the
Advisory Group. Their final appointment will be subject to the agreement of the Bank. The short-list
for consideration by the selection panel will be drawn up from applications received in response to
public advertisements in appropriate international magazines/journals.
36.   Equipment will be provided for the Federal and Regional Units to provide adequate office,
communications and computing facilities -- including electronic mail to link the various units with each



106                                                      Environmental Management Project
other as well as with other units established under the project and with foreign consultants. The
Federal and Urals Regional Units will have networked servers to enable them to manage and analyze
the databases on emission sources and environmental conditions as well as to model the impact of
proposed emission reductions on ambient pollution levels in the most polluted areas. Resources have
also been provided for the acquisition and installation of monitoring equipment to back up and assess
the effectiveness of the negotiated agreements between the environmental authorities and major
emission sources.
37.   Training is a crucial element of the component. As noted above, two intensive training
courses lasting 2-3 months each will be arranged at the beginning of the project. These courses will
partly be taught by foreign experts and partly by Russian experts. The courses will be taught in
Russian (with simultaneous translation if necessary) and all of the course materials will be translated
into Russian. After the courses have each been taught once with foreign assistance in developing the
course content and in teaching, it is intended that they should be repeated every year or two years with
Russian teaching staff and financed from fees or other local resources.
38.   Much of the training will occur on the job through close and continuing collaboration between
foreign advisers and their local counterparts. To reinforce and extend the experience gained in this
manner, a program of 3-4 month secondments will be established to enable many of the staff of the
Federal and Regional Units to work on concrete environmental policy issues in environmental agencies
or policy institutes in various market economies. The secondments must be well planned with clear
programs of work and responsibilities for the individuals concerned. Each work program will be
approved by the Project Manager in consultation with the Senior Policy and Legal Advisers and the
Policy Consultants' Advisory Group.
39.   A Training Consultant will be appointed to design and organize the formal training courses
to be provided at the beginning of the project and the program of secondments. The consultant should
include a Russian training institution in its team which can be responsible for taking over and
providing the formal training courses after the first year. The program of secondments proposed by
the consultant should cover more than one country, so that preference will be given to consultants
which can put together consortia of policy institutes and other appropriate agencies in several
countries.
40.   Resources have also been provided to hold workshops within Russia to disseminate the results
of the project and to train staff working for regional and local authorities other than those covered by
the project in the approach and methods followed in order to develop and implement regional and local
environmental action plans.
41.   In addition to the Policy and Regulatory Consultant and the Training Consultant, there will
be 6 sector consultancy contracts, one for each of the sectors to be covered by the sectoral team.
Each of these consultants will be responsible for drawing up a Sectoral Environmental Action Plan
in cooperation with the sectoral team in the Federal Unit and with the relevant Regional Units. It will
then be expected to provide support and advice for the process of the implementing the Action Plan,
especially with respect to the development of technical and economic proposals to underpin the
negotiation of emission reduction agreements with major polluters in the sector. Some of these
contracts may be funded by bilateral donors such as the preparation of an environmental action plan
for the pulp and paper sector which is being funded by the Finnish Government.
42.   It is envisaged that approximately half the funds provided for each contract will be allocated
to the development of the Sector Environmental Action Plan and the other half will be linked to the



Annex 3. 1                                                                           107
implementation of the Action Plan. Because this will involve the provision of advice and other
support over an extended period, preference will be given to consultants which propose joint teams
of foreign and Russian experts with a gradual transfer of skills, experience and responsibilities to the
Russian experts over the course of the project.



STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RUSSIAN FEDERATION
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMIENT PROJEC
ANNEX 3.2
ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY COMPONENT
COMPONENT DESCRIPTION
A.    Background
1.    One of the most important reasons for concern about environmental degradation is its adverse
effect on human health. Information on the magnitude of environmental hazards and their impact on
human health is therefore very important for setting policy priorities. Environmental epidemiology
is concerned with the quantification of the human exposure to pollutants and its effects on public
health. Knowledge of the distribution of environmental hazards -- with respect to geographic region,
environmental medium, source, pollutant, and the link to specific health outcomes such as infant
mortality, cancer and birth defects -- is crucial for making informed policy decisions.
2.    Environmental epidemiology has been practiced in Russia for over forty years and specialists
in the field of environmental epidemiology are located in a number of cities throughout the country.
But despite a long research tradition, environmental epidemiology research in Russia is ill-organized
and of variable quality. Consistent information is not available for a range of pollutants and health
problems across all regions. A number of studies have been conducted on a regional level, but there
has been no effort to date to coordinate or evaluate the information from a national perspective. Thus,
policymakers are faced with the very difficult task of setting national and local priorities based on the
limited information currently available.
3.    There are serious institutional problems as well.  Investigations regarding the impact of
environmental pollution on human health in Russia have been carried out by a wide variety of agencies
in Moscow and around the country. There has been no coordinated strategy for the identification,
evaluation and control of threats to human health from environmental pollution. The Soviet health
care system was organized in a highly centralized and vertical manner and information tended to travel
only in an upward direction. As a result, local health officials and epidemiologists often had limited
access to national data. Correspondingly there is no tradition of local feedback on locally collected
information. A weak horizontal exchange of information meant that specialists who discovered a local
concentration of health anomalies may have been unaware of a similar occurrence in an adjacent
region.
4.    There also have been problems with the flow of environmental exposure information.
Responsibility for carrying out government-supported programs has been divided among numerous
agencies and jurisdictions. For example, there have been gaps and overlaps in the routine collection
of environmental monitoring data due to unclear division of labor between various health and
environmental institutions.   The dissemination of research on environmental epidemiology is
problematic in Russia.  Publications are few in number and lack detailed information.  Standard
publication of technical reports containing in-depth descriptions of methods has never been practiced.
As a consequence, changes in the coordination of regional efforts, the centralization and



Annex 3.2                                                                              109
systematization of data collection efforts, and improved dissemination of research findings will be
necessary to improve the system in which environmental epidemiology is currently practiced.
5.     Limitations on the availability and quality of environmental health data has had a serious
impact on the formulation and implementation of environmental policy. Russia has strict ambient
standards and there are sanitary zones around plants that generate significant levels of pollution which
should not be used for housing or similar purposes. These standards and regulations are violated in
most instances and the costs of bringing most plants into compliance will be very large. Thus, it is
essential to focus the limited resources available upon those emission sources which have the biggest
impact on human health. The practice of singling out the most sensitive groups of the population, like
infants and children, or most exposed groups of the population, like workers, for policy oriented
analysis does not exist in Russia. Therefore, providing a consistent framework for collecting and
assessing environmental health information on infants and workers is a fundamental element in the
development of a cost-effective approach to environmental regulation.
6.     Data reported by Soviet officials indicate that the cost of environmental degradation in terms
of human health has been high. For example, in 1989, the USSR State Committee for Environmental
Protection referred to a study, conducted by the Institute of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine for
Children and Adolescents, which claimed that the prevalence of nervous disorders, allergies and
gastrointestinal illness among children had doubled between the 1960s and the 1980s, though it is not
clear to what extent environmental factors played a role in this increase. Mortality data suggest that
the health of the Russian population was improving through the 1970s, but has stagnated because of
the economic downturn and continuing low investments in health care.   Both adult and infant
mortality levels in the Russian Federation are considered high by western standards, and it is likely
that environmental hazards are a contributing factor. These estimates are highly unreliable because
of poor control of data generation.
7.     Concern about these hazards has prompted the development of computerized information
systems which will be used for environmental epidemiology by local and regional authorities in
various parts of the country. For instance, Tyumen invested DM4 million for such a system while
Bakov, Cherepovetz, Elekstrostal and the Komi republic have started similar initiatives. Such
activities take place independently with little coordination or quality control. To prevent idiosyncratic
developments where information cannot be pooled or matched, methodological and technical
standardization is needed.  (e.g. cross-calibrations of monitoring devices, use of standard
questionnaires, sample selection methods, protocols etc.).
8.    It is widely accepted that the quality of environmental and health data in Russia is extremely
uneven, so that the inherent variance of the data swamps differentials associated with systematic
environmental health hazards.
B.    Objectives
9.     The environmental health component of EMP has three basic objectives:
(i)    To develop federal and regional capacity to generate, collect, organize and interpret
environmental health data so as to provide a systematic basis for assessing
environmental health risks and setting environmental priorities at regional and federal
levels.



110                                                        Environmental Management Project
(ii)   to improve information about the relationship between environment and health in
Russia with an emphasis on monitoring the impact of changing environmental
conditions on the health of populations at the regional level.
(iii)   To carry out baseline and follow-up surveys, or site specific studies of a more
exploratory kind to establish the extent to which pollution is affecting the health of
children and workers, including populations living in sanitary zones.
10.   There is a significant degree of overlap between these objectives, so that federal and regional
initiatives will contribute towards meeting both objectives. However, it is important to distinguish
between them because they address problems faced by different branches of government. The first
focuses specifically on the policy concerns of the environmental authorities at federal and regional
level, since they are responsible for setting priorities, drafting and implementing environmental
legislation and allocating government resources available for environmental improvements.  The
second focuses on the broader concerns of those dealing with public health issues -- as well, of course,
as the fears of the public at large -- about the contribution of environmental factors to differentials in
mortality and morbidity rates across regions and countries.   The final objective links the
environmental health to environmental quality components and provides a systematic framework for
assessing the impact of policy-induced and other changes in exposure to pollution on the health of the
most vulnerable and/or most exposed groups of the population.
C.    Assistance Strategy
ll.    The contract for the component is expected to be awarded to one general contractor,
representing a consortium of research institutes and academia from at least two continents.
Preference in selecting the Consultant will be given to those whose teams mobilize staff and experience
from environmental and health institutes in more than one country and more than one continent. The
assistance will extend over a period of 4 years starting in November 1994. Approximately two-thirds
of the Consultant's inputs are expected to be provided in the second and third year of the contract.
12.   The Consultant should liaise closely with other consultant teams undertaking work for other
components of the Environmental Management Project. Training is a crucial element. Much of it
will take place through close and continuing collaboration between foreign advisors and their local
counterparts.  A part of the formal training program  is designed to precede any subsequent
implementation of the project.
13.   The sub-component projects involve the secondment of staff, for variable periods, to gain
practical experience by working at an Institute or other organization operated by the Consultant or its
subcontractors. These secondments will include some formal coursework, but their primary objective
is to train staff and to carry out environmental epidemiology investigations by working along with
others on similar studies. The secondments will be well planned with clear programs of work and
responsibilities for the individuals concerned.  Each work program -- in particular, the study or
studies to which the individual will be contributing -- will be approved by the Subcomponent Project
Manager in consultation with the Management Committee for that subcomponent.
14.   The lack of communication and exchange of information is a major constraint in the present
state of Russian environmental epidemiology. Therefore, strengthening of existing journals including
the existing newsletter of the MEPNR, and support for publication fees of foreign journals is provided
for under the Project.



Annex 3.2                                                                        111
D.    Counterparts and Implementation Arrangements
15.   The responsible department in MEPNR for this component is the Department of Ecological
Safety. A Component Management Committee consisting of representatives of MEPNR, the State
Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance (GOSKOMSANEPIDNADZOR), the State
Committee for Hydrometereology (ROSGIDROMET), the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences
has been set up to advise and supervise the work of the Subcomponent Project Managers at federal
and regional levels. The Federal Program Manager will be responsible for the management of the
federal level subcomponent, and the coordination of the two regional initiatives. He will be
responsible for the federal subcomponent technical subject areas such as the annual federal report,
federal databases and policy oriented analyses. He will be an ex-officio member of the subcomponent
Management Committee and will be assisted in his work by the General Consultant Firm, as outlined
in this firm's Terms of Reference.
16.   The federal Subcomponent Project Manager will lead a team of Russian experts who have been
seconded for the project. The Foreign Consultant Firm will provide foreign advisors to work with
this team, as well as the two regional implementation teams in the Urals and Upper Volga under
regional Subcomponent Project Managers. The two regional Subcomponent Project Managers will
report to Regional Subcomponent Management Committees under the Upper Volga and Urals Inter-
regional Environmental Councils, respectively.
E.    Activities and Outputs
17.   The environmental epidemiology component will focus on the following activities, which will
be incorporated into one federal subcomponent and two regional subcomponent projects:
3     Establish a Federal Environmental Epidemiology Center and strengthen federal
facilities and institutes in Moscow with particular emphasis on developing the capacity
to provide assessments of environmental health priorities relevant for national
legislation and policy.
*     Establish two Environmental Epidemiology Centers in the Urals and Upper Volga
regions to provide the essential expertise for the collection and analysis of data, and
support for environmental and health officials in regional governments. Undertake
specific investigations of the impact that emissions from individual plants have on the
health of the population at risk.
*     Develop the capability to enable regional authorities in the Urals region and the region
of the Upper Volga to develop their own policy priorities based on regional
assessments of environmental health conditions.
*     Improve the existing system for generating, collecting, managing and analyzing data
on infant and child health as the basis for monitoring the consequences of changes in
population exposure to  various pollutants. Data on variables such as the birth
weight, birth defects, infant diseases and child development can be sensitive indicators
for the impact of environmental conditions on the population in general.
*     Improve the existing Russian system to design and manage a program to collect and
analyze data on the health status and environmental conditions of working in different



112                                                      Environmental Management Project
industrial sectors of the economy and populations in industrial sanitary zones who are
at greatest risk due to environmental health impacts.
*     Develop and provide a series of policy oriented training courses in environmental
epidemiology.
*     Develop twinning relationships with foreign policy oriented environmental health
institutes.
SUB-COMPONENT 1:           THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FEDERAL
ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY CENTER
18.   The Federal Environmental Epidemiology Center will be responsible for providing support
and coordination for regional and federal initiatives on environmental epidemiology. Its efforts will
initially be focused on six principal areas:
*     Preparation of an annual report on environmental health in the Federation. This
annual report will be divided into two sections. The first section will provide an
overview of the incidence of health problems linked to environmental factors with
tables and maps showing the distribution of environmental hazards based on exposure
to pollutants in air, water and soil. It will also review evidence relating to the impact
of changing environmental conditions on the state of human health in Russia. The
framework of preparing such a general overview should provide the basis for
developing and disseminating a set of national priorities with respect to the incidence
and causes of environmental health problems. In the initial stage of the project this
report will be a critical evaluation of existing reports. The second section will
provide a detailed survey of relevant and well-founded studies on a particular issue
in environmental health -- such as the problems caused by exposure to lead and other
heavy metal dusts, or the contribution of environmental factors to differentials in the
incidence of respiratory diseases. This will summarize the findings of more than 100
institutes around the country and offer reference material on good practice in
environmental epidemiology for those undertaking specific local studies of particular
environmental health problems. The annual report will make an objective evaluation
of reported results and findings, and will highlight deficiencies in methodologies and
approaches.
*     Assessment and improvement of the quality of enviromnental health data. The
federal center would examine factors pertaining to the quality of existing data such as
methods of sample selection, chronological and geographical coverage, validity and
completeness, process of data generation, feedback between generation and analysis
of data, etc. The primary focus of the work is to identify good quality data that can
be used for assessing environmental health priorities and to develop methods of
improving 'poor quality' data for inclusion in this assessment. For instance, the
presently reported oscillation of national mortality rates during the last few years is
unrealistic. The development of a framework for generating, collecting and analyzing
standardized mortality data by districts (rayons) rather than just by Oblast is desirable.
In this way small area variations in mortality rates can be identified and linked to
differential exposure to various pollutants.    This is already being done in
Ekaterinburg (see below) and a small number of other Oblasts, but the system needs
to be extended on a consistent basis to cover a much larger sample of Oblasts. At



Annex 3.2                                                                            113
a minimum, the compilation of this database might initially focus on the Oblasts
covered by the two Regional Environmental Epidemiology Units in cooperation with
the central support group, but plans should be made for a gradual extension of its
coverage to include all Oblasts and autonomous republics which wish to be involved.
Some software and analytical tools have already been developed, so that the issue is
to ensure that variables and classifications are defined in a consistent manner and that
the necessary information from death certificates is recorded on a regular basis.
Another example is support for developing morbidity surveillance programs based on
population samples in urban areas. Such programs contain data on disease incidence
by broad diagnostic category and cover most of the urban centers in Russia where
there are significant environmental health concerns. Along with the local mortality
database (provided the data quality is acceptable), they should serve as the first line
of inquiry for those wishing to investigate environmental influences on human health.
*     Vulnerable Groups in the Population: Children and Infants. The project will
provide technical support at the federal and regional level for: (a) the generation,
collection and analysis of standardized data on infant and child health focusing on the
impact of environmental conditions on such variables as birth weights and defects,
infant mortality, and respiratory and gastro-intestinal illnesses, and (b) the
development of procedures and programs to monitor the consequences of changes in
environmental conditions on various indicators of child growth. Data on infant and
child health are a useful basis for monitoring changes in the impact of environmental
conditions on human health. There are a number of regional and federal initiatives
on this issue being proposed or undertaken by institutes associated with the Ministry
of Health and Sanepidnadzor. The purpose will be to coordinate and focus these
efforts. Thus the most useful information and results can be obtained for guiding the
development of environmental policies in the light of feedback from evidence on
infant and child health.  As a national program  it will also provide training and
support for those working in this field. Existing procedures for registering data on
infant and child health are, in any case, already being revised and improved. What
is needed, however, is to combine these data with information on local environmental
conditions. By monitoring subsequent changes in the incidence of the infant/child
health problems, which are most sensitive to environmental conditions, it will be
possible to create direct indicators for measuring changes in environmental health.
*     Most exposed sectoral groups in industrial plants and their vicinity (including
sanitary zones). There is a considerable uncertainty about the relative contributions
of occupational and general population exposures to various health problems
associated with industrial pollutants such as benzo-pyrenes, chlorinated hydrocarbons
and heavy metals (to name a few). This task will collect data and undertake analyses
designed to distinguish between occupational and general environmental factors in
order to assist the authorities to establish an appropriate balance between measures
designed to limit occupational exposures within plants and those intended to improve
environmental conditions outside plant boundaries. This will, in turn, contribute to
the formulation of policies with respect to the sanitary zones around large industrial
plants, which often include housing for the families of those working at the plants as
well as others. Recommendations based on these efforts will also contribute to the
design of regulatory system(s) to be developed by other components of the EMP.

*     Coordination of the Regional Environmental Epidemiology Centers - in terms of
training, secondment of foreign consultants, methodology, concentration on special
targeted groups in the population and quality assurance.  The federal unit's
coordination activities should concentrate particularly on the methodology of the
assessment of environmental health hazards, the collection and maintenance of
standardized databases of regional mortality and morbidity data related to
environmental conditions, and the improvement of the quality of environmental health
data. The federal center will second technical staff and will arrange for foreign
experts to work in the two regional epidemiological units.
*     The development of a training program for staff working in Federal and Regional
Environmental Epidemiology Centers, research institutes, and regional government
units concerned with environmental health. The foreign consultant's responsibility
will be to train trainers' and to assist in the development of case studies, course
materials and on developing an overall training strategy. The formal training would
be such that the program, at least partly, would be taught by local staff after the first
year of the project. The program will provide training in all aspects of environmental
epidemiology and the management of environmental health data for staff concerned
with environmental health issues in all parts of the country. The initial formal
training program will take eight weeks and includes specially organized courses or
training workshops for the staff involved in the project. The program will begin with
a course on practical evaluation of regional environmental health problems. The
initial program will consist of an initial course, supplemented by more advanced
courses on environmental epidemiology focused on the practical relevance of
environmental epidemiology for environmental policies. The course program would
address basic issues related to descriptive and analytical environmental epidemiology,
including:  routine monitoring of health and environment and it's role in
environmental epidemiology; basic designs of epidemiological surveys; methods of
collection of data on health and on exposure to environmental factors in
epidemiological surveys; control of confounding; principles of statistical analysis of
survey data; study results reporting, risk communication, policy implications of
environmental epidemiology studies; microcomputer use for epidemiologists; and basic
elements of quality assurance/quality control of laboratory procedures in application
to environmental health issues. Workshops on comparative experience and seminars
to present the results of work that has been undertaken will be held to ensure
cooperation and consistency between the Environmental Epidemiology Centers in
different parts of the country.
*     The courses would define follow-up activities to be conducted by the participants
within a defined time after the course. The activities would be a part of the overall
program to be undertaken under the project. To assure the effectiveness of the formal
training program, the number of participants in each session would not exceed twenty-
five. The program will be repeated throughout the course of the project with
increased involvement of local staff in teaching. After two years the local staff would
be able to teach the complete program  independently of the foreign expert's
assistance. The program would devote a substantial part of the training to issues on
child health and on occupational health related issues. These issues should be built
into the formal courses on environmental epidemiology as mentioned above.



Annex 3.2                                                                          115
19.   The Foreign Consultant will establish and operate a twinning arrangement between the Federal
Center and one or more foreign institutes with substantial experience in the application of
environmental epidemiology to the development of federal and regional environmental policies. The
arrangements would not involve a rigid framework in which one partner institute is paired with one
or more regional centers, since a matrix framework may be more satisfactory for providing technical
support in different areas of expertise.  The Consultant would encourage cooperation between the
regional centers as well as with their partner institutes.   The Federal Center will have the
responsibility for mobilizing technical and other support. This twinning arrangement would cover,
inter alia:
*     The secondment of 15 members of the staff of the Federal Center to partner institutes
for periods of 6 months each, to gain experience in working on issues and studies
relevant to the activities of the federal and regional centers. In particular, critical
review and replication studies whose findings are essential for the annual report will
be eligible for twinning arrangements;
*     Technical support for (a) the preparation of the yearly review  on federal
environmental health, (b) the generation, collection and analysis of standardized
mortality data, (c) the generation, collection and analysis of morbidity data, and (d)
the preparation of guidelines on data generation, collection, management and study
protocols to improve the quality and comparability of environmental health data and
studies in different parts of the country; and
e     Technical support for the regions for (a) the generation, collection and analysis of
standardized mortality data, (b) the generation, collection and analysis of morbidity
data under existing programs, (c) the provision of specialist advice and training in
environmental epidemiology for regional research institutes, Sanepidnadzor stations
in the region, regional environment and health departments, and others concerned with
environmental health problems in the region and (d) the development of regional
strategies to address environmental health problems.
SUB-COMPONENT 2:           ESTABLISHMENT OF TWO REGIONAL
ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY INITIATIVES.
20.   It is proposed that regional environmental epidemiology initiatives would be established as a
demonstration for regional system for generating, collecting, managing and analyzing data on regional
environmental health conditions. The regions that have been selected for this initial program are: the
Upper-Volga and the Urals.
21.   The objective of the regional initiatives will be to strengthen regional capacity, and to identify
and monitor environmental health priorities in collaboration with Oblast and municipal authorities in
charge of environmental and health policies. Their tasks will include:
*     Overseeing the generation, collection and management of environmental health data
and, as appropriate, acting to ensure the quality and consistency of such data;
*     Providing epidemiological expertise and specialist advice to improve the quality of
analyses of environmental health by local research institutes and other bodies;
*     Concentrate on infant and child health and occupational health;



116                                                         Environmental Management Project
*      Assisting Oblast, municipal and district environmental authorities in determining their
environmental health priorities as a basis for formulating regional environmental
priorities to guide the allocation of regional environmental funds, the negotiation and
enforcement of emission standards and the development of regional environmental
initiatives; and
*      Collaboration with research institutes and industrial plants in the region to design and
carry out reliable studies on the impact of pollution from individual plants on the
health of regional populations.
A.     The Urals Regional Environmental Health Initiative.
22.    Environmental health concerns are urgent in the Urals region (specifically in the Oblasts within
the area from Perm and Ekaterinburg in the north to Chelyabinsk in the center and Magnitogorsk in
the south), because of the high concentration of heavily polluting industries. These industries are
likely to experience substantial restructuring within the next five years. At the same time, Oblast and
municipal authorities will be playing an increasingly important role in monitoring and regulating
environmental conditions under their jurisdiction. These authorities will require substantial assistance
from a Regional Environmental Epidemiology initiative to support the development of their
environmental priorities and to monitor the impact of policies to mitigate environmental health damage
associated with past production, as well as current emissions.
23.    The purpose of the Urals Initiative is to build upon existing efforts in order to provide a
demonstration of the ways in which environmental epidemiology can contribute to the formulation of
environmental policies by assessing environmental health priorities and the potential impact of
alternative measures to address them. The local Sanepidnadzor station in Ekaterinburg stands out for
the general quality of its equipment, the expertise of its staff and its commitment to tackling regional
environmental health concerns.  There exists also a close cooperation between this station and the
Oblast Environmental and Health authorities because of the specific involvement of the Deputy
Governor of the Oblast who chairs the relevant coordinating committees.  Ekaterinburg has seven
institutes active in the field of environmental epidemiology: the Institute of Hygiene (Sanepidnadzor);
the Oblast Center of Sanepidnadzor financed by the Oblast (FAV); the Medical Institute, the Medical
Genetic Center for the Oblast (OBLZDRAV) and The Mother and Child Health Institute, all belonging
to the Ministry of Health; the Institute of Industrial Ecology of the Urals branch of the Russian
Academy of Sciences; and the Paediatric Hospital of the Oblast administration. These circumstances
provide an excellent framework for establishing a Regional Environmental Epidemiology initiative that
will lead the way in establishing the necessary collaborative links between regional environmental
policymakers and those working on environmental health problems.
24.    The Urals Initiative will encompass the two main Oblasts in the Urals region. The initiative
will provide support for studies of environmental conditions and for formulating priorities in each of
the Oblasts according to the tasks described in Sub-component 1 above.



Annex 3.2                                                                          117
25.   The Foreign Consultant will, through the federal unit, establish and operate a twinning
arrangement between the technical staff in the Urals Region and one or more overseas Institutes with
substantial experience in the application of environmental epidemiology to the development of regional
environmental priorities and initiatives in areas with a large concentration of heavy industry. This
twinning arrangement should cover, inter alia:
*     The secondment of 4-5 members of the regional staff to partner institutes for periods
of 6 months each, to gain experience in working on issues and studies relevant to the
environmental health problems in the Urals region; and
*     Technical support for: (a) the generation, collection and analysis of standardized
mortality data; (b) the generation, collection and analysis of morbidity data under
existing programs; (c) studies to examine the relative importance of occupational and
general environmental exposure to industrial pollutants in determining the health status
of populations living close to large industrial plants; (d) the provision of specialist
advice and training in environmental epidemiology for research institutes,
Sanepidnadzor stations, local environment and health departments, and others
concerned with environmental health problems in the region or the Oblast; and (e) the
development of regional strategies to address environmental health problems.
B.    The Upper Volga Regional Environmental Health Initiative.
26.   Environmental health concerns are an urgent priority in the region of the Upper Volga,
specifically in the Yaroslavl and Vologda Oblasts. Location of major polluting industries in these
Oblasts discharging into the Upper Volga River affects the whole river basin up to the Moscow area.
These industries are likely to experience substantial restructuring within the next five years. At the
same time, Oblast and municipal authorities will be playing an increasingly important role in
monitoring and regulating environmental conditions under their jurisdiction. These authorities will
require substantial assistance from a Regional Environmental Epidemiology initiative to support the
development of their environmental priorities and to monitor the impact of policies to mitigate
environmental health damage associated with past production as well as current emissions.
27.   The purpose of the Upper Volga Initiative is to build upon existing efforts of the regional
authorities and MEPNR within the framework of Ecological Disaster Zone (EDZ) designation of the
Cherepovitz area, regional activities for other components of the EMP and environmental effects olt
the whole river basin. Plans already exist to integrate the data of the air-monitoring system with the
health data of the Sanepidnadzor in Cherepovetz. The latter is well organized, well equipped with
computers and well connected with the Municipal Health Committee and Oblast Environmental
Committees of Yaroslav and Vologda Oblasts. These circumstances provide an excellent framework
for establishing a Regional Environmental Epidemiology Center in Cherepovetz that will also lead the
way in collaboration between regional environmental policymakers and those working on
environmental health problems.
28.   The Upper Volga Initiative will provide support for studies of environmental conditions and
for formulating priorities in each of the Oblasts according to the tasks described in Sub-component
A.  Due to deficiencies in the existing data, there is considerable uncertainty about the relative
contributions of occupational and general population exposures to various health problems associated
with industrial pollutants such as: carbon bisulphide; nitrogen dioxide; sulphur dioxide; and lead
(Cherepovetz); phenol and hydrogen sulphide (Yaroslavl); and hydrocarbons and hydrogen sulphide
(Tver). The Initiative will collect data and undertake analyses designed to distinguish occupational

and general environmental factors in order to assist the authorities to establish an appropriate balance
between measures designed to limit occupational exposures within plants and those intended to
improve environmental conditions outside plant boundaries.  This will, in turn, contribute to the
formulation of a policy with respect to the sanitary zones around large industrial plants which often
include housing for the families of those working at the plants, as well as others.
29.    The Foreign Consultant will, through the federal unit, establish and operate a twinning
arrangement between the technical staff that is seconded to the Upper Volga region and one or more
overseas Institutes with substantial experience in the application of environmental epidemiology to the
development of regional or local environmental priorities and initiatives in areas with a large
concentration of heavy industry. This twinning arrangement would cover, inter alia:
*      The secondment of 2-3 members of the regional staff to partner institutes for periods
of 6 months each, to gain experience in working on issues and studies relevant to the
environmental health problems in the Region of the Upper Volga; and
*      Technical support for: (a) the generation, collection and analysis of standardized
mortality data; (b) the generation, collection and analysis of morbidity data under
existing programs; (c) studies to examine the relative importance of occupational and
general environmental exposure to industrial pollutants in determining the health status
of populations living close to large industrial plants; (d) the provision of specialist
advice and training in environmental epidemiology for, Sanepidnadzor stations, local
environment and health departments, and others concerned with environmental health
problems in the region or the Oblast; and (e) the development of regional strategies
to address environmental health problems.
F.    Reporting
30.    The Consultant would submit a series of regular tri-yearly progress reports reviewing their
activities and assessing progress towards achieving the project objectives for each of the
sub-components. These should enumerate and briefly describe: (a) the inputs, activities and outputs
of the last period; (b) the contribution to the project objectives; (c) problems encountered, remedies
sought and further remedies proposed; (d) detailed plans for the coming periods and suggestions for
changes to the plans for later periods; and (e) any other issues. Reports on completed studies and
other material -- including working papers, training materials and descriptions of databases -- produced
in the course of the activities should be annexed to these regular reports.
31.    An inception report for the project should be submitted at the end of month 3, a midterm
report at the end of month 24 and a final report at the end of month 48. These reports should
encompass the regular quarterly reports due in the relevant months.
32.    Reports will be submitted to the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources
as well as other agencies specified by the Government in a total of at least eight Russian language and
two English language copies. At least two English language copies should be submitted to the Bank.



Annex 3.2                                                                              119
G.    Foreign Consultant Qualifications
33.    The Foreign Consultant's team  including subcontractors would include expertise in
environmental epidemiology and statistics, community and pediatric health issues, environmental and
health economics, occupational health, survey design and implementation, database management, and
geographical information systems.
34.    Since environmental conditions and policy choices differ greatly from  those that are
characteristic in OECD countries, substantial experience in industrializing countries, or in formerly
socialist countries will be important. Practical experience in carrying out policy-oriented studies of
environmental and other health issues in countries with incomplete data of variable quality will also
be important. The inclusion of local and other Russian-speaking consultants will be particularly
valuable for all aspects of the project, and is a requirement of the contract.



STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RUssN FEDERATION
ENVIRONNIENTAL MANAGEMENT PRtoECr
ANNEX 3.3
WATER QUALITY AND WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
COMPONENT DESCRIPTION
A.    Background
1.    There is substantial agreement among the principal water management agencies of the Russian
Federation on the nature of current water quality management problems and on the priorities for future
action. This is reflected in the framework outlined in Table 3.3.1 which links these priorities, to
specific strategies and objectives. The priorities for environmental management in the water sector
identified by the MEPNR and the other key water sector agencies are to:
*     Ensure the availability and supply of safe drinking water
*     Restore and maintain the ecological health of rivers and other water bodies
*     Promote water conservation and strengthen integrated water quality and quantity
management
2.    The strategy for ensuring the availability of safe drinking water focuses on managing
watersheds to protect sources of potable water supply including reducing pollution loads, identifying
alternative sources of supply, improving the effectiveness of drinking water treatment and distribution,
and adjusting priorities to reflect health risks. The strategy to restore and maintain the ecological
health of rivers and other water bodies focuses on improving the present system of ambient water
quality standards, increasing the effectiveness of the regulatory system, building the capacity to carry
out water quality assessments that support management needs, and increasing the effectiveness of
waste treatment. The third priority focuses on water conservation and strengthening integrated water
resource management, and the corresponding strategy will focus on the introduction of economic
incentives, institutional strengthening, and building greater public awareness. Despite the need for
specific actions in response to current problems of pollution and water quality degradation, most local
authorities recognize the need to develop an integrated and comprehensive approach to improved
management.
3.    The framework outlined in Table 3.3.1 not only provides an effective mechanism to develop
specific high priority projects, but also provides a convenient and effective means for the MEPNR to
formulate projects and programs, and to coordinate the activities of donors with an interest in carrying
out investment programs supporting its efforts to build capacity and strengthen the institutions in the
sector.



Annex 3.3                                                                            121
B.    Assistance Strategy
4.     The current transition in the Russian Federation to a new economic system that relies less on
the former command and control approach to environmental management and more on local initiative
and authority carried out within a broad federal policy framework has understandably resulted in
confusion and uncertainty. Local authorities have repeatedly stressed the need to strengthen four
areas:
*     the need to clarify the legal framework within which they will be required to operate.
The emergence of new federal laws on water and the environment do not fully satisfy
this need because they do not deal with the full range of changes needed in the
processes, methodologies, and procedures for such vital areas as priority setting,
permitting, standards, and enforcement;
*     the need to develop prioritized investment programs, particularly in the area of
municipal water and wastewater system improvements, in the context of
comprehensive and integrated water management plans. In the past there has been a
notable lack of participation by all the local affected parties when preparing plans, and
these plans often did not reflect a least cost approach nor the economic considerations
appropriate to a market type economy. The current budget crisis has made local
authorities acutely aware that the devolution of authority will bring with it new
financial burdens as well, and that these must be accompanied by a greater focus on
cost;
*     the need to translate plans into management actions. Local authorities are very aware
of the weaknesses of the former system of management and have expressed a strong
desire to know more about the experience of the OECD countries and to develop new
and more effective approaches and procedures that can work in their areas;
*     the need to focus on the problems of small watersheds and municipalities. The ability
of local and regional authorities to control activities across large river basins and
watersheds is extremely limited, not only because of the diversity of these activities
and the limited effectiveness of present regulatory systems, but also because they lack
practical and low-cost technologies and the mechanisms to disseminate them at the
local and enterprise levels. The devolution has left small municipalities with large
responsibilities and burdens for infrastructure, but the former system in which
technical capacity was centralized leaves these small municipalities with little or no
capacity to work out priorities and programs to deal with the most pressing
environmental and public health issues.
5.     Hence the initial focus of this Component will be on strengthening environmental and water
management rather than on investment in infrastructure.  The need for the rehabilitation,
modernization, and expansion of existing infrastructure, particularly water and waste water treatment
is evident. However, it is likely to be more cost-effective to concentrate initially on strengthening
existing management, introducing new technology and approaches, including economic incentives, and
identify priority projects and investment programs than to commit large, scarce resources to costly
infrastructure and uncertain improvements.
6.     Subcomponent projects specifically designed to meet immediate and long term needs in each
region will each address a limited subset of the objectives outlined in Table 3.3.1, and will be



122                                                      Environmental Management Project
implemented at the oblast or watershed level in different regions. The sub-component projects will
provide specific opportunities to develop, test, adapt, and demonstrate new methods and procedures,
train personnel and develop training materials, prepare, and implement portions of, integrated water
quality management action plans, and address both immediate and long-term needs.
7.    The Component will provide technical assistance for training, technology transfer, and the
development, testing, and demonstration of new processes, procedures, guidelines, and methodologies;
test the application of new economic tools and management mechanisms and instruments to improve
enforcement and compliance; provide training, particularly to create greater understanding of modern
practices and provide opportunities to collaborate with foreign experts and to study and adapt
experience in OECD countries; provide for procurement of equipment; provide for the implementation
of demonstration projects and activities; and provide resources to develop and implement an outreach
program to coordinate and disseminate project findings, recommendations, and lessons.
C.    Objectives
8.    The objectives of the Water Quality and Water Resources Management Component of the
Environment Management Project are to assist MEPNR and officials of the environment and water
management agencies at the oblast level:
(i)   to integrate and improve the effectiveness of present environmental management plans,
infrastructure, institutions, economic instruments and regulatory arrangements with
respect to water quantity and quality, particularly in relation to urban water and waste
water services;
(ii)   to acquire and adapt modern approaches and new technology as well as recent
experience in the OECD countries; and
(iii)  to expand the pipeline of high priority projects consistent with the ongoing economic
transition.
D.    The Role of Other Donors and Bilateral Agencies
9.    Other bilateral and multilateral international agencies and donors are supporting or planning
to support improved environmental and water management and environmental restoration in the
Russian Federation. The framework of priorities, objectives, and subcomponent projects established
under this project is expected to assist the MEPNR and other water sector agencies to coordinate this
assistance, and to provide clearer priorities for donor programming.
10.   Several bilateral donors including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Agency
for International Development (AID) of the U.S. Government, and Environment Canada have directly
assisted the Bank and the Ministry in preparing this project. Several other donors including the
Governments of the Netherlands, Germany and Finland have expressed interest in supporting some
of the sub-component project activities.
E.    Approach
11.   While local environmental and water management authorities have traditionally had a strong
administrative role in environment and water management, particularly in the permitting, planning and
operation of water management facilities, and water allocation functions, the increased emphasis on



Annex 3.3                                                                         123
decentralization is creating the opportunity for greater regional and local initiative and leadership in
developing new approaches to more effective management. The high degree of interdependence and
potential for effective coordination among different agencies at the regional level is very evident in
their response to this project and represents an opportunity to develop an integrated approach. Hence,
the approach adopted for the Water Quality Management Component is to focus on the execution of
site specific sub-component projects in selected priority regions utilizing the existing local network
among environment and water management institutions to provide management oversight and to
facilitate implementation.
12.   EMP Program. The Water Quality and Water Resources Management Component focuses
on developing and testing solutions to the major water quality management problems in three key
regions: (a) the Upper Volga River basin; (b) the Urals region; and (c) the North Caucasus region.
The subcomponent in each region will consist of an integrated planning and regulatory reform
program aimed at improving safe drinking water supplies, developing a prioritized investment and
action program, and addressing key sectoral policy issues through pilot project activities at the oblast
level. Each subcomponent will also support existing regional organizations and improved regional
inter-agency management of priority issues. In addition, the component will support a Federal
Program to provide mechanisms within the Project to disseminate the results of pilot projects to others
who are not directly participating in project activities, and to create the opportunity for those working
on various pilot projects to meet periodically to exchange experiences. This federal program will be
executed by the MEPNR's Department of Surface Water Protection.
13.   Upper Volga River Basin (Annex 3.3.1). This is a vast region of forests and farms with its
modest population concentrated in an number of large industrial cities and important tourist areas
located in the riverain environment of the Volga River. The river is the main source of water supply
for the region's population, is an important fishery, navigation and transportation link, and source of
hydroelectric power. The subcomponent will support the newly formed Inter-regional Council of the
Upper Volga formed by the five concerned Oblasts with the goal of improving and restoring the
ecological condition of the Upper Volga River. The objectives of the subcomponent include the
identification of strategies and priority investment programs to improve the quality and efficiency
water supply systems in selected cities, asses alternative region economic policy options to
management water use and quality, and develop regulatory reform programs for industrial and
municipal water management.;
14.   North Caucasus Region (Annex 3.3.2). This subcomponent will focus on the problems of
integrated water management and conservation in the Lower Don River basin (from the Tsimlyansk
reservoir to the Azov sea) in the Rostov Oblast.   The Don River is one of the largest rivers in
european Russia. It has been intensively developed for irrigation, hydropower, and water supply.
The water supply and waste water management problems of the large cities of this region, including
Rostov, include supply deficits characterized by intermittent service, microbiological contamination
due to the lack of treatment capacity and inadequate maintenance of the distribution systems. Reduced
flows brought about by the more intensive irrigation water use, including reservoir storage, have led
to increased salinity in the Azov sea, and pollution in its highly urbanized and industrialized lower
basin have resulted in major fisheries and ecological damage. The objectives of the subcomponent
include the development of prototype monitoring systems, demonstration of small watershed
management practices, development of strategies and prioritized investment programs for improving
water supply and municipal wastewater treatment, and the development of integrated strategies for
regional water management and conservation focusing in particular on improvement in water supply

15.   The Urals Region (Annex 3.3.3). This subcomponent will be located in the major industrial
city of Ekaterinburg, and will focus on the problems of integrated management of the raw and treated
water supply of Ekaterinburg. The large concentration and rapid growth of industry and population
combined with periodic droughts, especially over the last 50 years, has led to the development of
complex water management systems comprising numerous reservoirs and inter-regional transfers.
Public heath officials believe that environmental conditions in the oblast and surrounding areas, which
have greatly effected the quality of drinking water supplies, have been a primary factor in the reported
higher than average incidence of disease and worsening morbidity rates. The objectives of this
subcomponent include assessment of the threat to public health from drinking water supplies and
sources of supply for Ekaterinburg; evaluation and prioritization of current infrastructure needs and
the institutional and technical framework for supplying potable water and protecting its quality;
recommend physical, operational, legal, financial, and institutional improvements; demonstrate specific
measures to reduce threats to public health stemming from drinking water; and strengthen local/Oblast
institutions for drinking water management.
F.    Project Organization
16.   The Government has designated the Ministry of Environment Protection and Natural Resources
(MEPNR) as the lead agency for implementation and coordination of EMP activities, and management
of the EMP loan as well as other donor financed activities within the EMP framework. The MEPNR
has established an inter-agency Component Management Committee to supervise implementation of
the Water Quality and Water Resources Management Component that will be chaired by the director
of the MEPNR's Department of Surface Water Protection.
17.   The MEPNR will delegate responsibility for day-to-day technical and administrative functions
for implementation of the regional Water Quality and Water Resource Management Subcomponents
to a Sub-component Management Committee (SCMC) and a Sub-component Program Manager
(SCPM). The activities of the SCMC and SCPM will be supported in the following areas by the CPPI
(Annex 7.4) liaison; procurement; disbursement; reporting, accounting, and audition; information
exchange; and related policies and procedures.
18.   The SCPM will hire a team of experienced Russian technical staff (with the number varying
depending on the size and complexity of the program) and administrative and support staff to form
a Subcomponent Implementation Team (SIT). The SIT staff will be recruited and appointed in
accordance with guidelines and personnel policies established by the CPPI (see also paragraph 4.86).
SIT staff will provide technical management and support for implementation of the SCMC
subcomponent; This team will be equipped with reproduction, communication, computer, and
essential general technical office equipment to support implementation of the subcomponent, and will
provide direct support for Russian and foreign advisors and consultants, including space, equipment,
and administrative support such as travel and meeting arrangements, interpreters, and translation
services as described in the final subcomponent TOR.
G.    Schedule
19.   An overall period of four years is assumed for the implementation of the Water Quality and
Water Resources Management Component, divided into two phases as outlined below.
20.   Phase I - Start-up Activities. Activities during this initial Phase will establish the institutional
framework for implementation of the Water Quality and Resources Management Component at the
regional level. The EMP loan would finance the establishment and staffing of the SCPM, provide the

specialized training needed by the SCPMs, the staff of SITs and the members of the SCMCs. The
General Consultant firm will assist the CPPI in its work. Activities will include:
*     build a national level program team including the SCPMs, staff of the MEPNR, CPPI,
and other key agencies; develop a common concept of the purpose, approach and aims
of the project, establish milestones and specifics goals, and develop regular
mechanisms for communication and coordination;
*     provide training to the SCPMs in CPPI policies and procedures, project management,
work planning and preparation of tender documents for consulting services; develop
mechanisms and approaches for effective working relationships with the CPPI,
donors, and other government agencies at the federal, regional, and local levels;
*     establish the regional SIT Offices including the recruitment of staff, procurement of
equipment; provide training for SIT staff;
*     build a regional level project team consisting of the SCPM, SIT, as well as Russian
and foreign experts.
21.   Phase l(b) - Inception and Work Planning. Activities during this phase, which follows
immediately on the subcomponent team building workshop, would develop a detailed work plan and
plan of implementation for each subcomponent project. Analysis and planning would focus on
sources, availability of data, methodologies, detailed discussion of expected outputs, results and their
relation to the objectives. The work plan includes the description, sequencing, and scheduling of work
tasks, data requirements, and analytical methods in sufficient detail to prepare the contractors TORs
and monitor progress of the work. The implementation plan would include a determination of all
inputs required to complete the subcomponent project including contracts to provide local and foreign
technical assistance, equipment, etc. Local technical resources to be used to implement the pilot
project would be identified and evaluated. The implementation plan would include a schedule of
subcontracts and all required Terms of Reference.
22.   Phase 11 - Implementation of Subcomponents (3.5 years). This phase would consist of the
implementation of each of the subcomponents. The component would provide consultants (local and
foreign) to assist the SCPM and SIT to carry out studies, surveys, and analysis; equipment; training
including workshops and study tours; and demonstration projects and activities.
23.   Phase 1 - Federal Program of Outreach and Coordination (3.5 years). This phase of the
project would develop a mechanism to network the various subcomponent projects to insure the
exchange of experience between team working on the same type of pilot project, and a mechanism
such as a annual or semi-annual seminar or workshop to link subcomponent project teams to oblasts
and municipalities that are not participating in the project. It would run in parallel with the
implementation of each regional subcomponent.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRoECr
ANNEX 3.3.1
UPPER VOLGA RIVER BASIN INTEGRATED REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL
MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND STRATEGIES
SUBCOMPONENT DESCRIPTION
A.    Background
1.    The Upper Volga River extends 1263 km from its source in the Valdai Hills northwest of
Moscow to the confluence of the Oka river. The total watershed area is 229,000 sq.km. From its
headwaters the river flows through a series of small reservoirs among which is the Ivankovskoya
which is one of the principal sources of drinking water for Moscow. The 448 km long river stretch
between Rybinsk and Nizhni Novgorod has been replaced by the Gorky reservoir. Filled in 1955-1957
with usable capacity 3,6 cu.km, it became the last element in the Upper Volga cascade system (mean
annual discharge 53 cu.km). The total installed capacity of the 4 hydropower stations of the Upper
Volga cascade is about 900 MW (Ivankovo 30, Uglich 11, Rybinsk 330, Gorky 520). Although the
reservoirs that form the cascade are multipurpose, the interests of power generation have taken
precedence over other uses in the past. The river is also intensively used for navigation, predominantly
for the transport of oil products, coal and building materials.
2.    Unfortunately, the transformation of the Upper Volga for these purposes has resulted in a
number of important negative conditions from the standpoint of the environment and water
management. Groundwater tables have risen dramatically causing the expansion of swamps in the
basin. The large surfaces of shallow reservoir water, which become quite warm during summer, have
greatly increased evaporation. The existence of stagnant, shallow embayments along the edges of
storage reservoirs has led to the substantial accumulation of pollutants. Pollution of bottom sediments
is a serious problem especially in the northern part of the Rybinsk reservoir where waste from the
industrial complex at Cherpavets has done great damage to water quality and the aquatic ecosphere
of the upper Volga reservoirs. Eutrophication, manifested by luxuriant growth of aquatic and semi-
aquatic vegetation is now a prominent feature in summer with consequent degradation of water quality.
The rising groundwater tables, as well as the intermittent existence of shallow surface waters, have
significantly altered vegetation in immediate shore areas. In some cases, the rise of groundwater tables
has proved to be detrimental to forests which cover about 50 percent of the Upper Volga basin area.
Ice generally remains two weeks longer on the large reservoirs than it did on the original river.
3.    The total annual withdrawals of water in the Upper Volga basin are about 10.2 cu.km.,
including 2.7 cu.km. transferred to the Moscow water supply system. The total wastewater discharged
to inland water bodies is difficult to estimate but, for example, in Yaroslavl Oblast alone about
400,000 cu.m. are discharged annually, out of which about 75 percent are untreated or inadequately
treated. It is interesting to note that in this oblast about 90 percent of wastewater is discharged directly
to the Volga proper (or its reservoirs). Proportional to their flows, smaller rivers also receive
considerable pollution load and their quality is considerably below standards required for drinking
water sources. Except for small communities supplied by groundwater, the majority of the population



128                                                      Environmental Management Project
is served by surface water. The typical substances detected in the surface water bodies (Volga, its
reservoirs and tributaries) are oil products, copper, ammonia, nitrate, organic substances, phenols and
others, some exceeding by several times the maximum acceptable concentration (MAC) values.
4.    In the Upper Volga, as in most areas throughout Russia, there is a critical need for improved
drinking water treatment and supply systems. Each of the cities visited use the Volga River as their
source of supply and all recognized the need for upgrading of their treatment technology to include
carbon absorption and ozonation. In addition to the need for new technology and design assistance
there is a need to upgrade current operations through improved operation and maintenance, laboratory
capability, and overall management including water conservation.
5.    Regional Efforts to Take Action.  In response to a growing regional concern for and
recognition of these issues, the five oblasts which constitute the Upper Volga River basin - Vologda,
Ivanovo, Kostroma, Yaroslavl, and Tver - have formed the Inter-Oblast Environmental Council of
Upper Volga with the goal of improving and restoring the ecological condition of the Upper Volga
River. The Council consists of six voting members including the Chairman of the respective Oblast
Environmental Committees and the Chairman of the Council. Representatives of regional NGOs and
environmental organizations, academic and technical organizations in the region, and others may
participate in the work of the Council and have the right of an advisory vote. The current Chairman
is the Director of the Institute of Inland Water Biology in Borok. The members have agreed to form
a Regional Ecological Fund to support the Council's activities financed by contributions from the
respective Oblast ecological funds.
6.    The competence of the Council includes formulating and making recommendations on urgent
actions for improvement of ecological conditions in the Upper Volga; determining mechanisms to
finance programs and actions including the determination of Oblast contributions; adopting joint
decisions on disputed intra-regional issues; making recommendations on permanent or temporary
stoppage of industrial discharges; organizing and carrying out regional ecological studies; organizing
international environmental cooperation; and adopting an annual budget including allocations of the
Upper Volga Ecological Fund to various activities.
7.    Recognizing the deteriorating ecological condition of the river, and the complex character of
the causes, the Council has outlined a program to carry out an urgent assessment of the ecological
situation to identify the direction and causes of current trends, to identify priority issues, impacts and
problems, to develop scientifically sound basin environmental policy alternatives, to consider regional
strategic and near-term goals, and to adopt and implement a regional action plan for the restoration
of the ecological health of the river basin.
B.    Objectives
8.    The aim of this sub-project is to support the work of the Council and the respective Oblasts,
municipalities, and enterprises in the region to develop and implement an integrated regional
environmental management policy framework and action plan for the Upper Volga River basin, to
assess the main problems and factors affecting the safety and quality of drinking water in the Upper
Volga region, and identify strategy to improve drinking water supply and wastewater management
systems. The broader, long-term sup-project compliments the regional scientific program of the
Council by developing a near and mid-term policy and investment priority that are intended to lead
to immediate improvements. There are six specific objectives of the sub-project.

THE NORTH CAUCASUS REGION INTEGRATED WATER RESOURCES
CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT
SUBCOMPONENT DESCRIPTION
A. Introduction
1.    Project activities will be concentrated in the Lower Don River basin from the Tsimlyansk
reservoir to the Azov sea. The Don River is one of the largest rivers in European Russia. It has been
intensively developed for irrigation, hydropower, navigation, and water supply. Reduced flows
brought about by small rivers impoundment and siltation and more intensive water use, including
irrigation and reservoir storage, have led to increased salinity in the Azov sea, which combined with
pollution from sources in the highly urbanized and industrialized lower basin, has resulted in major
fisheries and ecological damage.
B.    Background
2.    Over the last 30 years, construction of a system of storage reservoirs on the Don River and
its tributaries has radically changed the hydrological regime of the river, especially in its lower reach
below the Tsimlyansk reservoir (24 km3 total capacity). Development of inland navigation (Volga-
Don canal) and irrigation water supply were the main purposes of these developments which almost
completely eliminated downstream floods. The mean spring runoff (April and May) recorded in
Razdorskaya cross-section about 60 km upstream of the Taganrog Bay where the Don flows into the
Azov Sea, was reduced from 16.6 km3 (mean value for 1881-1951) to 6.3 km3 (mean value for 1952-
1985).
3.    As a result of these developments and the consequent change of flooding regime, the natural
spawning grounds for fluvial anadromous fish have been drastically reduced in the lower Don River,
its delta and in the Azov Sea. Fish productivity in the area, considered earlier to be one of the highest
in the world, dropped from over 300,000 tons in the 1950s to present levels of about 10,000 - 30,000
tons/year. Pollution of water resources by poorly controlled wastewater discharges from industry,
municipalities and agriculture have also contributed to the reduction of fish population, as well as to
the degradation of drinking water supplies endangering public health.
4.    The Rostov Oblast Environment Committee has reported that in samples from the 20 public
water intakes located on the rivers Don, Mius, Seversky Donets, 17 do not comply with Federal
standards "GOST. Drinking Water" on bacteriological and chemical parameters. During the last 8-10
years in summer period vibrio similar to cholera were detected in the samples taken from drinking
water intakes. Pathogens of acute intestinal infections were detected in drinking water distribution
system in Shakhti City, Bagaevsky and Semikarakorsky districts Rostov Oblast. In 1991-93 eight
cases of group infection deceases directly caused by poor drinking water supply were registered in



Annex 3.3.2                                                                          135
Rostov Oblast (cities of Volgodonsk and Belaya Kalitva, Aksai and Zernograd districts). The total
number of people who became ill in those cases was about 700.
5.     While a large proportion of the total pollution load in the lower Don River basin comes from
activities in the Rostov Oblast, a substantial load also comes from mining, agriculture and industrial
activities in Ukraine through the Seversky Donets River which is the main tributary of the lower Don
River. The Seversky Donets pollution load commonly contains significant quantities of phenols,
chlorides, sulfates, heavy metals, pesticides and chemical fertilizers which pose serious risks to the
stream population in Russia, especially to the city of Kamensk-Shachtinsky located on the Seversky
Donets river. This city of about 70,000 people is growing and water is in short supply. The Seversky
Donets begins in Russia (Belgorod Oblast), flows through Ukraine, re-enters Russia and joins the
lower Don River about 150 km below the Tsimlyansk reservoir (about 150 km upstream of the city
of Rostov).
6.     The proposed subcomponent project area would cover the Lower Don water resources system,
from Tsimlyansk reservoir to the Taganrog Bay. This system includes the lower Don tributaries,
especially the Seversky Donets and Manych rivers. Although the project area is limited to the Lower
Don system and Rostov Oblast, it would address related problems in the upstream parts of the basin.
7.     Water Quality Monitoring. In the Lower Don Basin several agencies are active monitoring
water quality. These agencies include the Federal Survey for Hydrometeorology and Environmental
Monitoring responsible for measurement of stream flow, ambient water quality, precipitation, and
aquatic biota; State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance responsible for
microbiology in drinking water systems, sanitary quality of recreational and ambient waters; the
municipal "vodokanals" responsible for water quality upstream  from  major water intakes and
monitoring of drinking water in the distribution systems; Committee for Water Resources Management
responsible for water allocation and water-related data; Ministry of Environmental Protection and
Natural Resources responsible for point-source discharge monitoring; Committee of Geology and
Mineral Resources responsible for monitoring of the ground water quantity and quality.
8.     Several agencies have, for a long time, been producing water-quality data on major ions,
nutrients, oxygen, pH, turbidity, BOD5, and coliform bacteria. A limited amount of analyses for a few
metals, organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides, and phenols are currently available, but
many of the detection levels are above concentrations of drinking water and environmental concern.
Existing laboratory analytical capabilities are often out-dated and poorly supplied with chemicals and
disposable supplies; shortages of computers, software, and trained personnel have resulted in few
existing computer-data systems, and minimal sharing of data between agencies. Agencies are not using
consistent sample collection protocols within their agencies and between agencies. Quality control
samples are being collected but the results are difficult to find and there is no splitting of samples
between agencies. The quantification of pollution in point sources is often poor or unknown. Little
is known about concentrations of pollutants in sediments, tissues of aquatic biota, and the flow and
quality of ground water and its impact on surface water. Only the Hydrochemical Institute in Rostov
has interpreted the ambient water-quality data such as compilation of national ambient water quality
summaries on an annual basis. Data do not appear to be used to make water quality management
decisions (e.g. stream sections which exceed standards might receive greater attention for permitting).
All of the federal agencies are currently finding it extremely difficult to continue current monitoring
activities because of a severe lack of operational funds.
9.     Small River Watershed problems in the Don Basin. Within the Rostov Oblast there are a
large number of small rivers which are tributaries to the Don and other main rivers of the area or



136                                                         Environmental Management Project
which flow directly to the Azov Sea. The Oblast is intensively farmed with the primary crops being
wheat and corn. There are also a number of minor crops including sunflower, barley, sugar beets and
legumes. There is also a significant amount of pasture for grazing and hay production. In addition,
there are a number of large concentrated livestock and poultry enterprises. The majority of the farms
in the oblast are still large collective farms with a few private farms. The number of private farms is
growing, however the total is still very small. The collective farms are generally very large, ranging
from 10,000 to 20,000 hectares. The topography of the area is flat to gently rolling with some large
breaks near some of the streams and rivers. Past agricultural practices have focused entirely upon
production with little attention given to off-site impacts. Only recently have farmers begun to consider
the use of minimum tillage practices. Approximately 10-15 percent of the land is fallow each year.
This land is generally plowed in the fall and worked in the spring and summer for planting of winter
wheat in the fall. Fertilization is provided by use of animal waste and supplemented by up to 100
kg/ha of chemical fertilizer. Chemical fertilization and pesticides has decreased over the past several
years due to increased costs and lack of availability.
10.   Intensive industrial and agricultural use of water and land resources in small and medium size
river basins of the Lower Don resulted in their unsatisfactory condition characterized by decreased
water flow, increased water and soil pollution, and progressive siltation of rivers. The natural water
regime of most of the rivers is disturbed and reproduction conditions of most of the fish, animal and
vegetation species have been changed dramatically. Regulations on water protection zones are
typically not followed. Degradation of small rivers is stimulated by pesticides, nutrients, and
suspended solids loading, heavy metals and intensive eutrophication. Some rivers are transformed into
a cascade of ponds and reservoirs constructed by the collective farms. These ponds normally do not
have outlet facilities preventing continuous flow to the streams. They are used by the collective farms
for livestock watering, some irrigation as well as fishing and recreation.
11.   Recently, a number of projects for restoration and protection of small rivers were initiated and
either partially or fully implemented. However, restoration measures did not result in any significant
improvement of the ecological situation due to the lack of an integrated approach at the design stage,
insufficient data on natural bodies exposed to anthropogenic impact, lack of routine monitoring data
on the processes occurring within watersheds and streams. Sometimes, only fragments of the projects
were implemented which did not comply with demands of an integrated basin approach.
12.    Oblast water resource and environmental officials have indicated a strong desire to undertake
a pilot project in a small watershed to develop a comprehensive plan for both water and land
management. Such a project would also include demonstrations of erosion control, pesticides and
nutrient management, and household and animal waste management practices to minimize adverse
impacts to the water resources of the watershed. It is suggested to implement the pilot project in the
Kagalnik Azovsky River Basin, in the 12 km long reach of the river from the village of Kagalnitzkaya
to the mouth of the Mechetka River, including the area of the village and collective farm Kalinin. The
Kagalnik River Basin occupies the area of 5,040 km2, the length of the river is 162 km, total length
of the tributaries longer than 10 km is 432 km.
13.    The river receives mixed flow; the ratio between snow melting, ground and rain water varies
with years of different flow conditions; spring flood flow accounts for 70-80 percent of the annual
flow. River water resources within the basin in the year of average flow conditions approximate 76.4
million m3/year; in the year of 75 percent probability - 20.9 million m3; in a year of 95 percent
probability - 7.26 million m3. There are 10 reservoirs in the basin with a total volume of 21.0 million
m3 and 187 ponds with a total volume of 26.2 million m3. Water resources are used for agricultural
water supply irrigation; total volume of water withdrawn is about 40 million m3/year, including 20.15



Annex 3.3.2                                                                          137
million m3 of surface waters. The Kagalnik River is of fishery value and is a spawning area for
transitory and semitransitory fish.
14.   Intensive use, violation of the water protection zones and impoundment of streams resulted
in serious deterioration of hydrological and sanitary conditions in the basin. A considerable amount
of restoration measures are needed. In fact, some work on dredging of the river channels, elimination
of poorly designed dams and management of water protection zones have been carried out in the basin
over the last five years. In 1993, the Don BVO and SevKavNIIVKh started cooperative work on
development of a testing site to improve the system of water resources management.
C.    Objectives
15.   The objective of this subcomponent project is to develop an integrated water resources
management system for the Lower Don River basin, addressing in particular the following issues:
(1)    Operational assessment (evaluation) of the hydrological, hydrophysical, hydrochemical
and ecological characteristics and conditions of the project area, including information
on storage reservoirs, main water uses including environmentally sensitive areas and
in-stream uses, sources of water pollution and environmental degradation, and water
conservation measures
(2)    Assessment of effects on ecological conditions and trends in the project area stemming
from existing water resources use and management activities including existing and
planned investments undertaken for the utilization and protection of water resources
(3)    Development of an integrated system for water resources conservation, operational
management and long-term planning in the Lower Don River basin, addressing in
particular the conflicting uses of water quality protection, fishery management, flood
control, irrigation and industrial water use, drinking water supply, nature
conservation, navigation and hydropower production
(4)    Assess the current water-quality conditions and monitoring activities, to fill critical
data gaps, and to design a modern multipurpose and integrated water quantity/quality
monitoring program in the Lower Don River basin, upstream of water intakes for
municipal drinking water supply. The assessment will include the analysis of current
surface and ground-water data; physical, chemical, and biological data; as well as the
collection of specific data to fill data gaps
(5)    Develop a water quality management plan for a selected demonstration and pilot small
watershed. The plan would consider all impacts on the aquatic ecosystem of the
watershed from both point and nonpoint sources, with particular emphasis on the need
to control erosion and sedimentation pesticides and nutrients and livestock wastes.
16.   This subcomponent project would address also relevant water policy issues, including legal,
institutional, regulatory, economic and financial aspects of integrated water quantity and quality
management. In the project area, the problems of inter-oblast and international cooperation in the area
of water resources management are of particular significance.

D.    Scope of Work
17.   The subcomponent project would consist of five principal tasks:
Task I        Assessment of adequacy of existing water resource data for operational
management and strategic planning, and development of prototype water
quantity and quality monitoring system, including information on principal
water uses in the basin.
la.    Assemble existing water data files. Store all existing water (quantity and
quality, surface and ground water) data in one computer data base. The water
quality data would include physical, chemical, aquatic biological, and habitat
data and any associated QA/QC data. The relational data storage system
would include a data dictionary inclusive of all analyses; location, date and
time of sampling; agency collecting data; medium (soil, water, stream bed
sediment, tissue); method of analysis; and associated quality control data.
The data base will include compliance monitoring of point-source effluents
when available. Existing digital line data will also be stored for land use,
land cover, hydrography, geology, precipitation, transportation, and other
ancillary data sets that may be used for interpreting water quality data, such
as population.
lb.    Upgrade current water data collection. Upgrade existing Russian protocols
for measuring, sampling, preserving, filtering, analyzing, recording, and
sharing of water quantity and quality data. Provide laboratories and field
sampling teams with the critical sampling and laboratory equipment needed
to follow the revised protocols. Write a quality assurance plan to identify
quality control measurements needed to quantify accuracy and precision of
data. Train personnel working with samples, analyses, and data to use the
protocols and follow the quality assurance program. Commence a data-
sharing program to include the exchange of computer-stored data. Prepare
a data summary to include number of samples, analyses, sites  sampled,
number of times standards were exceeded, and a description of the data as
appropriate, possibly including seasonal trends, long-term trends, and
causative factors for all data collected in the project area.
Ic.    Identity data gaps and collect selected data. Data gaps will be identified that
would significantly contribute to developing a more accurate conceptual model
of water resources. Such data might include quantification of pollution
sources, analysis of steambed sediments and tissues for metals and organic
compounds, synoptic measurement of point sources and ambient conditions,
ground-water quality and its seasonal variability in specific areas to
understand surface-ground water interactions, quality of precipitation, etc.
The collection of some of the data will include development of new protocols,
provision of training, and acquisition of analytical equipment When possible,
the collection and analysis of samples and the sharing of data will include
participation of as many agencies as possible.
Id.   Assess current water-quality conditions. The assessment of water and related
data will provide managers with a current conceptual model of water-quality



Annex 3.3.2                                                                          139
conditions in the Lower Don River basin upstream of the municipal water
intakes. This conceptual model will include, where possible, all parts of the
hydrologic cycle, such as precipitation, snow melt, overland runoff, ground-
water infiltration, ground-water discharge, well pumpage, reservoir
regulation, diversion of surface water for water supplies and industries,
discharge of point sources, and evaporation. The conceptual model will
include, where possible, spacial variability; seasonal variability; long-term
trends; daily, seasonal, and annual loads; and the source, cause, transport,
fate, and effect of contaminants in the basins; when the data do not allow
quantification of source, cause, transport, fate, and effects, hypotheses will
be identified to provide guidance for designing a new monitoring program.
Oral presentations of results will be made to all interested agencies on a
regular basis. These results, when there is sufficient data to support actions,
will recommend management actions, potentially including a revision of
standards, greater treatment of waste sources, or regulation of reservoir
operation.
le.    Identifying management needs. Management responsibilities, needs, and the
interaction of all participating agencies need to be identified While the
assessment will provide a conceptual model of current water-quality
conditions, the design of a new water monitoring plan needs to consider
current and anticipated needs and uses of water for at least the next 10 years.
Such needs will include population change, water use, management of land
and water use, and political and social changes. Managers of water resources
will be asked to identify management alternatives, such as conservation, new
storage reservoirs, use of ground water, restriction of water use, and
increased irrigation needs.
If.    Design new prototype water-quality monitoring program. The new design
will include the identified water-resource management needs and management
alternatives, the current conceptual model and hypotheses identified in the
assessment, and will be constrained by costs, analytical capability, and our
knowledge of how to collect, analyze and interpret data. The following such
tasks will be identified in the design: coordination of all agency activities;
objectives of water-quality monitoring program in relation to management
needs; design a coordinated monitoring plan incorporating different agency
data-collected programs and joint needs of the participating agencies,
including sampling sites, and protocols, sample preservation, analyses, and
quality assurance plan; implementation plan to include each agencies
responsibility in the plan, including storing and sharing of data; interpretation
of the data to meet management needs and advise agencies of needed changes;
communication of the results to managers, the local, oblast and federal
governments, and the public; and evaluation of the effectiveness of the
monitoring program and revision of the program on a regular basis.

F.    Plan of Implementation
19.   The Don River Basin Agency (Don BVO), in collaboration with the Rostov Oblast Committee
for the Protection of Nature, would be responsible for implementation of tasks 2, 4 and 5 of this
subcomponent project. These tasks would be carried out by working groups involving Russian
specialists from such institutions as the North-Caucasus Branch of the Russian Institute for Integrated
Utilization and Protection of Water Resources, the Azov Sea Research Institute of Fishery Problems,
Rostov University, Hydrochemical Institute and others. This project would be coordinated with the
international Black Sea program and the project results would be directly used for development of the
Black Sea recommendations. Working relationships would be established with the non-governmental
environmental organizations. The activity shall include foreign and local training components,
consultations of foreign specialists, and supply of necessary equipment specified tentatively in the
project cost estimates.
20.   Task 1 will be carried out jointly by the Federal Survey for Hydrometeorology and
Environmental Monitoring, State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance, the
concerned "vodokanals", Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, Committee
of Geology and Mineral Resources, and Don River Basin Agency. This task will require each of the
agencies currently collecting water-quality data to review their sampling and laboratory analysis
methods and ensure they meet the revised protocols. Training will be needed within the region to
acquaint field and laboratory personnel with revised protocols and quality assurance plan. Much of
the work in the task would be undertaken by those agencies currently collecting and analyzing samples
and data and their consultants with close collaboration of foreign technical consults. It would be
expected that some computers for data storage data analysis, and Geographic Information System
(GIS), and equipment for sample collection and laboratory analyses will be provided for agencies
responsible for the assessment of data and the collection and analysis of water samples respectively.
In addition, it is likely that travel abroad will be necessary for some personnel to observe first hand
data analysis techniques and special training available in the USA and Western European countries.
This task will take place over approximately a three year period.



144                                                      Environmental Management Project
21.   Task 3 would be carried out by the Don River Basin Agency with support from the Oblast
Committee of Environmental Protection, the Committee of Agriculture, the Committee of Land Use,
the Northern Caucasus Branch of Russian Federation Research Institute of Integrated Use and
Protection of Natural Resources, regional and local officials and one or more collective farms. It is
very important that agricultural officials from the oblast and local area as well as farmers be involved
in the project from the beginning to get their input to the project and to assure their acceptance of the
project and the various land management practices which they will eventually be expected to
implement. This pilot would require the use of consultants or individuals with experience in
comprehensive watershed planning and in the development and implementation of agricultural
demonstration projects. Much of the work in carrying out the project would be undertaken by oblast
and river basin authority staff and their consultants in close collaboration with outside technical
consultation. It would be expected that some equipment for both monitoring (among others, mobile
environmental laboratories), construction of demonstration and for training and workshops will be
necessary. In addition, it is likely that travel abroad will be necessary for some oblast and
regional/local officials and local specialists to observe first hand some of the practices being utilized
in the USA or Western Europe countries. This subcomponent project would take place over
approximately a three year period.

ANNEX 3.3.3
THE URALS REGIONAL INTEGRATED WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT FOR
THE EKATERINBURG WATER-SUPPLY SYSTEM
SUBCOMPONENT DESCRIPTION
A.    Background
1.    Water supply for the 1.5 million residents of Ekaterinburg comes from the Isset, Chusovaya,
and Ufa rivers. Six reservoirs provide raw water storage and a maximum safe yield of approximately
800,000 cubic meters per day. The current potable water demand is 600,000 cubic meters per day.
Many of the 200 industries in the area are served by the municipal water supply system, with a
significant portion of the treated water being used for non-potable purposes. Distribution system
leakage is reported by local officials to be 10 to 12 percent, with about 70 percent of the delivered
water going to residential use and 30 percent to industrial and commercial customers. The water
distribution system includes 150,000 cubic meters of treated water storage capacity, 8,300 water
meters, and 1,145 kilometers of distribution mains. There are 800 kilometers of sewers in the
wastewater collection system.
2.    The municipal water and wastewater systems are managed by the Ekaterinburg Vodokanal,
with support from local engineering consultants and contractors. There are two water treatment plants
with design capacities of 400,000 and 200,000 cubic meters per day. The larger (western) plant is
being expanded to 600,000 cubic meters per day. Two wastewater plants provide secondary
treatment. Design capacities are 550,000 and 180,000 cubic meters per day. Actual flows average
520,000 and 195,000 cubic meters per day, respectively. Wastewater flows exceed potable water
demands due primarily to six large industries that withdraw water directly from local rivers and
discharge wastewaters to the sewer system.
3.    According to the Sanitation and Epidemiological Service, approximately 50 percent of drinking
water samples fail to meet bacteria standards. Potential sources of contamination include inadequate
treatment, storage tanks, leaking mains, and cross connections. Some 30 to 40 percent of samples do
not meet one or more chemical standard. Analytical improvements and additional sampling are needed
to confirm these chemical results. One reason for the degraded drinking water quality is the lack of
sufficient revenues for proper water treatment and maintenance of the distribution system. Industrial
water rates are 180 rubles per cubic meter and residential rates are 2 rubles, 25 kopecs. At present,
rate increases are not feasible due to economic conditions and public perceptions and attitudes.
4.    At least three other agencies are actively involved in water supply management. Hydromet
collects weather and ambient water quality data (56 water quality stations in the Sverdlovsk Oblast are
sampled 1 to 2 times a month). The Committee on Water Resources is responsible for water source
development, reservoir operation, watershed protection, and river/reservoir monitoring. The Oblast
Environmental Committee is responsible for environmental protection, discharge monitoring, and
regulation. The large number of water management agencies make coordination, communication,
avoiding duplication, and maintaining adequate expertise and facilities difficult.  Monitoring,
laboratory facilities, and data management illustrate this problem. At least five organizations are
involved in defining monitoring needs, collecting samples, conducting laboratory analyses, and
evaluating the results.

5.     Major concerns among public health, environmental, and water supply agencies include: (1)
risks to public health and the environment from inadequate drinking water and wastewater treatment;
(2) inadequate source protection, water treatment, and distribution system design and maintenance that
results in a failure to consistently deliver acceptable water service; (3) lack of sufficient revenues and
public support to maintain and improve the water infrastructure and operations; (4) need for improved
technical capabilities, legislation, and economic incentives for optimum water allocations and reservoir
operations (e.g., water conservation, recycling, and reduced industrial use of potable water for non-
potable purposes); (5) increasing importance of watershed management, regulation, enforcement, and
pollution control in protecting water sources from existing and future impacts; and (6) need for
additional monitoring and laboratory capabilities (or efficiencies) that will provide data for effective
system operation and enforcement actions.
B.    Objectives
6.     During project preparatory visits to the Sverdlovsk Oblast, the Oblast government, local
agencies, and environmental organizations expressed a desire for project support under the Water
Management Component. Based on the major concerns and suggested subcomponent project activities,
the primary objectives are to: (1) assess the threat to public health from drinking water supplies and
sources of supply for Ekaterinburg; (2) evaluate current infrastructure needs and the institutional and

RUSSIAN FEDERATION
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
ANNEX 3.4.1
DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL WASTE
DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
SUBCOMPONENT DESCRIPTION
A.    Background
1.           This subcomponent project is one of two core subcomponents to be executed by the
Russian Federation as part of the Environmental Management Project (EMP), Hazardous Waste
Component. The purpose of the Hazardous Waste Component is to provide key elements of technical
assistance to the Russian Federation at the national and regional level in their efforts to:
3     prevent the further build-up of hazardous wastes which pose a health threat to
workers, the population at large, and threaten the economic viability of enterprises
over the longer term;
3     develop programs for prevention of formation (where possible) and\or recycle or re-
use of hazardous wastes;
3     improve the management of hazardous waste as it is currently being generated and
facilitate the restoration of environmental conditions at traditional disposal sites;
3     provide for training and technology transfer, collaboration with foreign experts,
essential equipment and minor related infrastructure, studies and pilot and
demonstration projects.
2.           In general, it is intended that technical assistance activities will be directed at solving
problems, removing constraints and barriers, and strengthening institutions in the area of legislative
and regulatory policy reform. Technology and methodology improvements will include upgrading the
efficiency and operation of existing infrastructure, testing the application of new regulatory and
economic tools to improve enforcement and compliance, education and training, and strengthening and
streamlining administrative procedures and institutional arrangements.
3.           More specifically, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources
(MEPNR) and the World Bank have agreed on the following priorities related to the development of
specific activities within the Hazardous Waste Management Component:
*     Upgrading and developing environmental management infrastructure and institutions
for management of hazardous waste in the MEPNR and its associated agencies and
committees at the Republic, oblasts, kray, and local levels for management of
hazardous waste.
*     Carrying out of pilot projects and action in selected areas to enable the transfer and
adoption of modem approaches and technologies and to develop, test and demonstrate



152                                                       Environmental Management Project
new methodologies and approaches especially designed to reduce public exposure to
hazardous waste, minimize creation of new waste and reduce the volume of existing
stored waste and improve capacity in setting priorities for cleaning up existing
disposal sites.
4.            The predominant method of hazardous and industrial waste management is large scale
land disposal using unlined lagoons and landfills. Release of liquid industrial waste water, either
directly or via municipal sewers, is also widespread. Little formal treatment, resource recovery, or
waste minimization techniques are applied. Substantial quantities of waste are also being stored at
generating enterprises, pending the availability of adequate treatment and disposal facilities. There
is widespread illegal, indiscriminate, unauthorized dumping of industrial waste. Waste streams are
typically intermixed, thereby complicating treatment and disposal. Scarcity of land is putting pressure
on enterprises to consider options other than land disposal. Concern for surface water quality and
potential contamination of primary domestic and industrial water supplies is rising.
5.           MEPNR officials as well as those at the regional level believe that abatement and
remediation of the existing hazardous waste problems in Russia cannot proceed without specific
legislation dealing with hazardous waste and a strengthening of the supporting institutional system for
its management in accordance with well established "cradle to grave" principles. For their part,
MEPNR is actively developing a new set of laws applicable to waste management generally. They
are eager to apply relevant experience from other countries in enhancing and further developing the
specific legislative and institutional framework for hazardous waste. Similarity, they acknowledge the
need to move this experience to the regional level where it can be practically applied.
6.           The World Bank Missions on the Hazardous Waste Component have concurred with
the need for legislative development and institutional system building as a basis for addressing the
hazardous waste issue. More specifically, the observation has been made that the planning and
implementation of a comprehensive legislative and institutional framework suffeis from a lack of
current and complete data respecting hazardous waste generation and management practice. In
addition, an opportunity exists to integrate the development of this framework with current trends
toward waste prevention at source, and as a positive factor in the technological change and
modernization programs being undertaken in the nation's industrial sector.
7.           On this basis, two core subcomponents, of which this is one, have been identified for
the Environmental Management Project (EMP), Hazardous Waste Component. These are:
*     Development of a National Industrial Waste Data Management System
a     Development and Demonstration of Regulatory Management System for Hazardous
Waste Control at the Regional Level
8.           A third Subcomponent Project entitled the "Development and Demonstration of Waste
Related Environmental Management Studies" has also been developed under the overall EMP,
Hazardous Waste Component framework. This identifies six enterprise specific studies covering the
oil refining, steel making, metal fabricating, printing, paint manufacturing, and chemical sectors.
These are being presented as opportunities for donor countries who may participate in the EMP.
9.           The development of a legal and legislative framework for Hazardous Waste
Management, is included in the Regional Policy and Regulatory Support Component of EMP.



Annex 3.4.1                                                                            153
10.           This subcomponent project is the first of those listed above. A general observation
of the World Bank Missions on the Hazardous Waste Component of EMP is that there is a lack of an
adequate information base respecting the generation and disposition of industrial waste at the national
level. A consistent common basis for the consolidation and analysis of this information is also
required. This presents a significant impediment to policy development, and prioritizing coordinated
national response action, particularly with respect to the development of effective and viable waste
management infrastructure. The development of a national industrial waste data management system
and its demonstration as a planning tool for waste management facility planning is felt by both the
World Bank and MEPNR to be a high priority perquisite to effective action on the issue.
11.           A basic national waste classification system has been developed and implemented.
However, this has not been fully extended to the detailed level required for an effective regulatory
management system, nor has its review for consistency with the Basel Convention on the Control of
Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal been completed. The Russian
Federation has signed but not formally ratified this international convention. Work to make the
necessary changes has been initiated but is not progressing expeditiously.
12.           A number of waste data collection initiatives have been undertaken at the local,
industrial sector and national levels. Under MEPNR direction, City and Oblast Environmental
Committee's have established reporting requirements for major enterprises in the last several years
and this information is being accumulated. However, the transfer of this information to and within
the federal level on a consistent basis is sporadic and incomplete. At the federal level, a national
waste inventory has been undertaken by the State Institute for Applied Ecology (SIAE). However,
barriers within the national government structure appear to exist for the transfer of current data, such
that this inventory is current and comprehensive. Within MEPNR, resources available to handle,
interpret and transfer the data received also remains limited. Plans to have the SIAE consolidate
locally supplied data into a national inventory on a regular basis have not been implemented due to
lack of resources. In addition, independent nationwide studies of industrial waste data have been
carried out in the project "Waste," administered by the Institute for Economic Problems for Nature
Management (IEPNM). Similarly, several industry specific organizations, either Ministries or
Committees for particular industrial sectors or associated Institutes, have data on wastes in their
particular industrial sectors. However, a general lack of coordination and consolidation of this
information has been noted and conflicts respecting valuation and access of this data are apparent.
13.          It has been observed that current industrial waste management practices depend almost
exclusively on direct land disposal, utilizing large scale lagoons and landfills, or direct discharge of
liquid effluents to surface water. Only limited discrimination among these industrial wastes is utilized
in employing these disposal practices. These practices are resulting in significant environmental
impact and in many cases have exhausted available land. A large scale development program will be
required to provide more effective and environmentally sound facilities, something that should involve
a nationally based plan, utilizing accurate data. In the absence of a consolidated picture of industrial
waste generation, tabulated on a consistent basis at the national level, it is difficult for coordinated
planning of actual waste management infrastructure to occur. As a result, initiatives currently being
proposed to MEPNR from the local and regional levels are largely being made on an adhoc basis.
14.           In summary, it has been concluded that the ability to quantify the amount, nature and
disposition of such wastes on a consistent basis across the country with any reliable accuracy is poor.
This creates a serious barrier to MEPNR being able to plan, prioritize and effectively implement waste
management legislative and regulatory programs on consistent national level. It also limits their ability
to rank problems, such that resources required for preventative and corrective action, particularly



154                                                      Environmental Management Project
related to new waste management infrastructure, can be allocated in an efficient manner. Finally, the
need to integrate hazardous waste management issues and impacts with air and water protection
programs and non-hazardous solid waste management initiatives is impeded. The latter is considered
a basic requirement for effective overall environmental policy decision making.
15.          This subcomponent project is intended to address these needs in both the near and long
term through the development of a national industrial waste data management and information system,
inclusive of providing a planning basis for new waste management infrastructure development. It is
seen as a necessary tool, required to support the Russian Federation's efforts to address it's hazardous
waste management problems.
B.    Objectives
16.          The overall objective of this subcomponent project is to provide the Russian Federation
and specifically MEPNR with the on going ability to collect, classify, document, analyze and report
data respecting the nature, quantity and disposition of industrial and particularly hazardous wastes
generated within the Federation.
17.          More specifically, an operational data management and information system is to be
developed for use within MEPNR for the purpose of defining industrial waste management issues and
support the development of effective national policies for the sound management of these wastes.
18.          Within three years, an operational data management system is to be in place, within
MEPNR. This system will allow accurate predictions of waste generation to be made, as a function
of waste type, industrial sector and region, and utilizing a uniform waste classification system
compatible with the Basel Convention. In addition, it will be utilized to initiate the coordinated
planning of improved waste management infrastructure at the national level during this period.
19.          All of this work shall be carried out in a manner contributing to the broader objectives
and priorities of the Environmental Management Project (EMP) and the  Hazardous Waste
Management Component. To this end, close coordination and integration of activities with other
subcomponent projects within the Hazardous Waste Management Component, and where appropriate
with the following EMP components:
*     Policy and Regulatory Support Component
*     Environmental Epidemiology Component
*     Water Quality Management Component
C.    Assistance Strategy
20.          The assistance provided for through this subcomponent project will extend for a three
year period, starting in November, 1994.
21.          Consistent with the objective of developing a continuing capability for the collection
and analysis of waste related information at the national level, this subcomponent project will be
implemented under the supervision of the Institute for Economic Problems for Nature Management
(IEPNM), an organization providing expert technical support to MEPNR. It is intended that the
capability and infrastructure developed, namely the National Industrial Waste Data Management
System, will be transferred to this organization upon the subcomponent project's completion for the
on going use by MEPNR.



Annex 3.4.1                                                                      155
22.          Direct supervision of the subcomponent project's implementation will be provided by
a Russian Project Manager, reporting to IEPNM. Staffing will be provided by Russian technical
professionals recruited primarily from local Institutes and other organizations, on the basis of a
secondment arrangement, such that a transfer of experience and expertise is assured upon the
subcomponent project's completion. Foreign advisor assistance in each of the subcomponent's
elements will be provided by a foreign consultant, contracted in accordance with the international
competitive bidding practices established for the EMP.
23.          The subcomponent project team will liaise closely with those undertaking other
projects within the Hazardous Waste Management Component of EMP, as well those being
undertaking in other EMP components. Facilitation of this liaison, as required, will be through the
Center for Project Preparation and Implementation (CPPI) and the supervisory committees established
within MEPNR.
24.          Training will form an important element of the subcomponent project with the transfer
of operational data management capability into IEPNM and MEPNR being a priority. This will most
effectively take place through close collaboration between the technical advisors, the Russian technical
professionals employed as part of the subcomponent project team, and IEPNM and MEPNR staff.
In addition, formal training events such as workshops, regular presentations, study tours and group
discussions should also be included. As appropriate, these training opportunities should be extended
to representatives of various industrial sectors affected by the work. Specific training will also be
coordinated with broader training activities undertaken with in other EMP components as appropriate.
D.    Counterparts and Implementation Arrangements
25.          The coordinating agency for this subcomponent project will be MEPNR and

functional organization structure, and various undertakings and commitments of the various parties
have been documented in a Framework Agreement between MEPNR, IEPNM and the CPPI. This
Agreement is included in Annex 7.7.4(a).
E.    Activities and Outputs
39.          This subcomponent project is directed toward the progressive development of a
national industrial waste data management system over a three year period. In the first year, all
existing data be consolidated, the revised national waste classification will be implemented and a
preliminary assessment of it will be undertaken. This will provide initial information for immediate
policy planning. During the second year, an automated data management system will be developed
and tested. Over the three year period, data analysis capability, specifically directed to its utilization
in the planning of waste management infrastructure will be developed and training in the system within
industry and local environment committees will be undertaken. The basic product is an operational
system within MEPNR at the end of this period. The three defined parts of the project are described
in more detail in the following.
Part 1:      Rapid Assessment
40.           This element will target the consolidation of existing data and implementation of
pending revisions to the national waste classification system. It's efficient completion is viewed as
a condition of continuing with subsequent project parts. lt should also provide a general consolidated
assessment of the current national picture respecting industrial waste generation and its disposition,
inclusive of storage for future treatment and disposal. An existing World Bank model, utilizing
industrial production statistics and factors may be employed, along with the consolidation of existing
data. Part 1 is expected to be completed by the end of Year 1 of the project and be an input into the
updating of the Russian National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), which is being undertaken as
part of the National and Regional Policy and Regulatory Support Component.
40.           The following specific activities and outputs are identified as being required:
a)    Consolidation and review of all waste generation and disposition data currently in
MEPNR's hands.
b)    Identification of all other sources or repository of data within other Federal Ministries,
Committees or affiliated Institutes, regional Environment Committees and
Administrations and independent organizations.

c)     Removal of barriers to access to this data and establishment of mechanisms and
procedures for continued collection and transfer of it.
d)     Validation of the revised national waste classification as consistent with international
agreements and suitability for application at both national and local levels on an
ongoing basis.
e)    Implementation of the revised national waste classification system through Ministerial
action or equivalent means such that it is established as a national standard.
f)     Translation of existing data at a high level into the revised industrial waste
classification system and aggregation of this information in a report, describing the
waste type, geographical distribution of generation, industrial sector of generation and
disposition as a function of quantity.
g)     Review and apply as appropriate, the World Bank Model with particular reference to
available industrial production factors and other inputs.
h)     Develop formal reports respecting waste generation and its impacts for purposes of
inclusion into the Russian Environmental Action Plan.
Part 2:       System Design, Development and Data Verification
41.          This element will utilize the experience from Part 1 in the development of an automated
system for waste generation collection, consolidation and evaluation of data obtained by MEPNR on
an ongoing basis. This will entail physical development of a centralized data management system,
inclusive of hardware and software as well as establishment of procedures and practices necessary to
support it, both within MEPNR and at the regional and industrial enterprise level. Data verification
will be particularly important in this stage. This part is envisioned to begin during the overall
project's first year with a functioning system being in place and tested by the end of Year 2. The
following specific activities and outputs are identified as being required.
a)     Review data format and input requirements with the framework of the revised national
waste classification system.
b)     Identify and define the system's reporting requirements at all levels that it will serve.
c)     Undertake consultation with stakeholders providing inputs to or receiving information
from the system.

IEPNM/MEPNR's operating responsibility.
Part 3:       Data Evaluation and System Implementation
42.          This element involves the formal implementation of the system nationally and its
application to evaluate data for purposes of developing national industrial waste management policies
and action plans. With respect to the latter, specific emphasis will be placed on the use of information
generated as the system is developed to identify and prioritize requirements for waste management
facilities on a coordinated basis. It will also focus on the training and transfer aspects of the project
to ensure that the experience and system operation expertise is ultimately operational within
IEPNM/MEPNR and, as required, regional and industrial organizations. In particular, it will include
training at the waste generation data collection level to ensure consistency and improved data quality.
This part extends over the full three year project period. The following specific activities and outputs
are identified as being required.
a)     Rapid assessment evaluation of existing data with respect to potential generic options
for its treatment disposal.
b)     Preliminary prioritization of waste generation with respect to type and potential

ANNEX 3.4.2
REGULATORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL
SUBCOMPONENT DESCRIPTION
A.  Background
1.           This subcomponent project is one of two core subcomponents to be executed by the
Russian Federation as part of the Environmental Management Project (EMP), Hazardous Waste
Component. The purpose of the Hazardous Waste Component is to provide key elements of technical
assistance to the Russian Federation at the national and regional level in their efforts to:
*     prevent the further build-up of hazardous wastes which pose a health threat to
workers, the population at large, and threaten the economic viability of enterprises
over the longer term;
     develop programs for prevention of formation (where possible) and\or recycle or re-
use of hazardous wastes;
=     improve the management of hazardous waste as it is currently being generated and
facilitate the restoration of environmental conditions at traditional disposal sites;
3     provide for training and technology transfer, collaboration with foreign experts,
essential equipment and minor related infrastructure, studies and pilot and
demonstration projects.
2.           In general, it is intended that technical assistance activities will be directed at solving
problems, removing constraints and barriers, and strengthening institutions in the area of legislative
and regulatory policy reform. Technology and methodology improvements will include upgrading the
efficiency and operation of existing infrastructure, testing the application of new regulatory and
economic tools to improve enforcement and compliance, education and training, and strengthening and
streamlining administrative procedures and institutional arrangements.
3.           More specifically, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources
(MEPNR) and the World Bank have agreed on the following priorities related to the development of
specific activities within the Hazardous Waste Management Component:
*     Upgrading and developing environmental management infrastructure and institutions
for the management of hazardous waste in the MEPNR and its associated agencies and
committees at the Republic, oblasts, kray, and local levels.
*     Carrying out of pilot projects and action in selected areas to enable the transfer and
adoption of modem approaches and technologies and to develop, test and demonstrate
new methodologies and approaches especially designed to reduce public exposure to



Annex 3.4.2                                                                       163
hazardous waste, minimize creation of new waste and reduce the volume of existing
stored waste and improve capacity in setting priorities for cleaning up existing
disposal sites.
4.           The predominant method of hazardous and industrial waste management is large scale
land disposal using unlined lagoons and landfills. Release of liquid industrial waste water, either
directly or via municipal sewers, is also widespread. Little formal treatment, resource recovery, or
waste minimization techniques are applied. Substantial quantities of waste are also being stored at
generating enterprises, pending the availability of adequate treatment and disposal facilities. There
is widespread illegal, indiscriminate, unauthorized dumping of industrial waste. Waste streams are
typically intermixed, thereby complicating treatment and disposal. Scarcity of land is putting pressure
on enterprises to consider options other than land disposal. Concern for surface water quality and
potential contamination of primary domestic and industrial water supplies is rising.
5.           MEPNR officials as well as those at the regional level believe that abatement and
remediation of the existing hazardous waste problems in Russia cannot proceed without specific
legislation dealing with hazardous waste and a strengthening of the supporting institutional system for
its management in accordance with well established "cradle to grave" principles. For their part,
MEPNR is actively developing a new set of laws applicable to waste management generally. They
are eager to apply relevant experience from other countries in enhancing and further developing the
specific legislative and institutional framework for hazardous waste. Similarity, they acknowledge the
need to move this experience to the regional level where it can be practically applied.
6.           The World Bank Missions on the Hazardous Waste Component have concurred with
the need for legislative development and institutional system building as a basis for addressing the
hazardous waste issue. More specifically, the observation has been made that the planning and
implementation of a comprehensive legislative and institutional framework suffers from a lack of
current and complete data respecting hazardous waste generation and management practice. In
addition, an opportunity exists to integrate the development of this framework with current trends
toward waste prevention at source, and as a positive factor in the technological change and
modernization programs being undertaken in the nation's industrial sector.
7.           On this basis, two core subcomponents, of which this is one, have been identified for
the Environmental Management Project (EMP), Hazardous Waste Component. These are:
*     Development of a National Industrial Waste Data Management System
*     Development and Demonstration of Regulatory Management System for Hazardous
Waste Control at the Regional Level
8.           A third Subcomponent Project entitled the "Development and Demonstration of Waste
Related Environmental Management Studies" has also been developed under the overall EMP,
Hazardous Waste Component framework. This identifies six enterprise specific studies covering the
oil refining, steel making, metal fabricating, printing, paint manufacturing, and chemical se'tors.
These are being presented as opportunities for donor countries who may participate in the EMP.
9.           The development of a legal and legislative framework for Hazardous Waste
Management, is included in the National and Regional Policy and Regulatory Support Component
Institutional and Policies Component of EMP.



164                                                        Environmental Management Project
10.          This subcomponent project is the second of the above listed core subcomponent
projects. It is directed toward the creation of the basic regulatory system necessary to provide for the
detailed characterization and tracking of hazardous wastes, and to control the management of these
wastes. Such a system is considered a fundamental requirement for dealing with the hazardous waste
problem and developing improved management practices. This has been reinforced by the conclusions
of the World Bank Legal Team who recommend that the development of functional environmental
control regulations should take priority over the actual laws which will eventually provide a legal
framework for their application.
11.          Two approaches are available to developing and implementing this functional
regulatory management capability. It could be developed at the national level and passed down to
regional Environment Committees for implementation. Alternatively, it could be developed, tested
and demonstrated within a representative regional jurisdiction or group of regional jurisdictions. It
would then be adopted for broader national application under the auspices of the MEPNR. The former
approach is institutionally difficult to do at this time and likely beyond the current resources available.
The latter approach will yield more immediate, tangible results and optimize the use of available
resources.
12.          Oblast and City Environmental Committees have generally made some progress in
identifying where hazardous waste are generated and, to a lesser degree, what is happening to them.
To date, activity seems to have focused primarily on quantifying generation at major industries,
largely as a basis for determining pollution fee assessments. However, they have not had the resources
to develop or implement any but the most rudimentary regulatory mechanisms or practices required
to exercise control over its generation, or disposition, inclusive of its storage pending availability of
proper management facilities.
13.          The basic requirements commonly identified as necessary for an effective hazardous
waste regulatory system are the ability to characterize and classify the wastes, track them from point
of generation through to their final disposal, and control the methods applied to their management.
More specifically, three fundamental regulatory system components are required:
*     Detailed Hazardous Waste Classification System
*     Hazardous Waste Tracking System
*     Hazardous Waste Management Facility Approval System
14.          Each of these system components will consist of a number of elements, including
formal enforceable regulations, implementation procedures, communication and consultation practice
on their implementation, and training for both regulatory officials and those to whom the system is
applied. It is understood that the overall waste classification system, currently under development
within MEPNR, will be finalized and enacted as a priority task within the National Industrial Waste
Data Management System Subcomponent Project. Within this subcomponent project, the waste
classification system will be implemented at a detailed level.
15.          In order to adequately support the implementation of this system, it is recognized that
a physical measurement capability in the form of analytical, sampling and monitoring services is also
required to characterize wastes and evaluate the environmental performance of management practices
applied to it. Therefore, the enhancement of existing regional measurement capability should be
provided for and integrated with the regulatory system's development.



Annex 3.4.2                                                                       165
16.          This subcomponent project will be executed at a regional level, recognizing a role
must be played by national authorities to ensure the experience is transierred to other regions. A
number of regional jurisdictions were jointly assessed by MEPNR and World Bank Missions as
candidates for this project. This assessment involved evaluation of present local regulatory capacity
as reflected in the Oblast and City Environment Committees, commitment to addressing the issue
exhibited by regional and local councils and administrations, the nature and distribution of hazardous
waste problems requiring attention, and the practicality of an area serving as an effective
demonstration to others at the regional level.
17.          On the basis of this assessment, two Oblasts, namely Yaroslavl and Vologda in the
Upper Volga region have been selected. A high level of commitment and cooperation is exhibited by
the regional and local Environment Committees, particularly within the major industrial centers of
Yaroslavl and Cherepovetz. Local administrations and elected Councils appear willing to take the
necessary action to support a regional regulatory control system. The area offers a wide distribution
of representative industry which will be characteristic of their respective industrial sectors. Significant
industrial and hazardous waste problems have already been identified in the area, some of which are
considered critical in environmental impact terms, particularly in relation to the Volga River and
Ribinsk Reservoir. Finally, several other EMP Components which will be complimentary are slated
for implementation in the Region. These include three potential waste related environmental studies
identified as donor funded technical assistance opportunities as part of the Hazardous Waste
Component (Cherepovetz Steel Mill, Yaroslavl Paint and Refinery enterprises). A subcomponent of
the Water Quality Management Component will be done in the Upper Volga Region. A regional
subcomponent project has been identified for the City of Cherepovetz as part of the Environmental
Epidemiology Subcomponent. Finally, the project will be supported by the National and Regional
Regulatory Support Component.
B.    Objectives
18.          The overall objective of this subcomponent project is to develop and demonstrate the
basic elements of a functional regulatory capability, necessary to control the generation and
management of hazardous waste, at a regional level. More specifically, it is intended to develop and
put in place the necessary tools, in the form of regulations, practices, procedures and support
infrastructure, which can effectively:
*     characterize and classify hazardous wastes for regulatory control purposes;
*     track hazardous wastes from point of their source of generation to point of disposal;
*     control the management practices applied to them throughout their life cycle: and
*     provide sufficient measurement capability to adequately support the above capability.
19.          All of this work will be carried out in a manner contributing to the broader objectives
and priorities of the Environmental Management Project (EMP) and its Hazardous Waste Component.
To this end, close coordination and integration of activities with other subcomponent projects within
the Hazardous Waste Component, and, where appropriate, with other EMP Components as follows:
*     Policy and Regulatory Support Component
*     Environmental Epidemiology Component
*     Water Quality Management Component

C.    Assistance Strategy
20.          The assistance proposed under this project will extend over a four year period, starting
in November, 1994.
21.          Consistent with the objective of developing and demonstrating basic regulatory
management capability at the regional level, this subcomponent project will be implemented under the
supervision of a Regional Committee chaired by the Oblast Environmental Committees and having
representation by key stakeholder groups as listed in Section D below.
22.          Direct supervision of the subcomponent project's implementation will be provided by
a Russian Subcomponent Project Manager, reporting to the Regional Committee. Staffing will be
provided by Russian technical professionals recruited from related Government organizations such as
Environmental Committees and Administrations, local Institutes and other organizations within the
region. Employment will be on the basis of a secondment arrangement, such that a transfer of
experience and expertise is assured upon the subcomponent project's completion. Foreign advisor
assistance in each of the subcomponent's elements will be provided a foreign consultant, contracted
in accordance with the international competitive bidding practices established for the EMP.
23.          The subcomponent project team will liaise closely with those undertaking other
subcomponent projects within the EMP Hazardous Waste Management Component as well those being
undertaken in other EMP Components, particularly those with Regional subcomponents focused in the
Upper Volga Region. Facilitation of this liaison as required will be provided by the Center for Project
Preparation and Implementation (CPPI) and the various supervisory committees established within
MEPNR.
24.          Training will form an important element of the subcomponents project. This will most
effectively take place through close collaboration between the technical advisors, the Russian technical
professionals employed as part of the project team, MEPNR officials and the regulatory staff in the
regional and city authorities.  In addition, formal training events such as workshops, regular
presentations, study tours and group discussions should also be included.  As appropriate, these
training opportunities should be  extended to regional industries affected by the project's
implementation, other affected agencies in the Upper Volga Region, and regional stakeholders such
as non-government organization, the media, and members of the public. Project specific training will
also be coordinated with broader EMP training initiatives undertaken under other EMP components
as appropriate.
25.          Public and stakeholder consultation on the regulatory system under development will
be required. It is considered critical to the project's success that a consensus on the system among
a wide range of affected parties be achieved as a basis for the system's implementation, demonstration
and ultimately effective adoption as a model for wider application in the Russian Federation.

E.    Activities and Outputs
43.          The overall scope of this subcomponent project is the development and implementation
of the three basic elements of a hazardous waste regulatory system, namely a detailed waste
classification system, a waste tracking system and a waste management facility approval system. This
will be done at the regional level in Vologda and Yaroslavl Oblasts with the full participation of
appropriate City Environment Committees, particularly in Cherepovetz and Yaroslavl.  Once
established it is intended to be emulated by other regions under the auspices of MEPNR. Recognizing
that such a system requires a measurement capability in the form of analytical, sampling and
monitoring capability to support it, upgrading of this type of infrastructure at the regional level will
be provided for in both Oblasts.
44.          The project has three Parts as follows:
Part 1 Detailed Waste Classification and Facility Standards Development
Part 2 Development and Implementation of a Hazardous Waste Tracking System
Part 3 Establishment of a Supporting Measurement Capability
45.          Part 1 will undertake the development and implementation of two regulatory
management elements; detailed waste classification and facility standards. Part 2 will be directed
toward development and implementation of the actual waste tracking system. Both Parts 1 and 2 will
have a number of common generic tasks, these being the development of enforceable regulations, the
development of implementation procedures related to such things as interpretation, enforcement,
reporting, and training. Part 3, involving the development of measurement capability, will also have
strong emphasis on training, and as well as applicable testing and QA/QC standards. In all cases,
consistency with international standards and agreements will be a consideration. Similarly, each part
will require specific stakeholder consultation during system development and communication during
its implementation.
Part 1:      Waste Classiflcation System and Facility Standards Development.
46.           This element will cover the following scope, activity and output elements:
ScpRe:
1.    Evaluate the regulatory measures proposed with respect to their economic impact and
cost benefit to ensure their practicality.

2.    Implement and test a detailed hazardous waste classification system which, in effect,
will act as the common language and definition base for the regulatory system,
utilizing the national waste classification system finalized as part of the National
Industrial Waste Data Management System subcomponent project.
3.     Ensure that this system can be practically applied in the Russian context, adequately
prioritizes potential environmental risk and impact, supports the requirements of the
other regulatory system elements, and is compatible with various international
standards and agreements that the country is or may be signatory to.
4.     Develop an effective regulatory control capability for the various waste management
activities applied to hazardous waste at various stages of their life cycle in the form
of licensing or permitting of specific activities or facilities required for their
management.

RUSSLAN FEDERATION
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
ANNEX 4.1
NATIONAL POLLUTION ABATEMENT FACILITY
ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
The main assumptions used in the base case financial projections are as follows:
*     The NPAF lending rate is 11 percent;
The NPAF receives a grant of 10 million Swiss Francs (approximately $7 million);
*     The NPAF's weighted average cost of funds, including the Swiss grant, is 6.47
percent;
*     The average loan size is $1.9 million. The NPAF finances 30 projects with its initial
$50 million allocation from the Bank and $7 million grant from the Swiss
Government;
*     The initial $57 million allocation is committed over 3 years, at a pace of 10
commitments per year;
*     Sub-loans disburse over three calendar years -- 25 percent during the second semester
of the first year, 50 percent during the second year, and 25 percent during the first
semester of the third year;
*     Sub-loans are repaid in 8 equal, semi-annual installments starting at the beginning of
the fourth year and ending in the second half of the seventh year;
*     All principal repayments received by the NPAF are relent by the NPAF to new
borrowers so that the loan portfolio remains constant at $50 million following the
initial start-up phase;
*     The NPAF charges an up-front appraisal fee of 1 percent of the loan commitment or
$16,666 for the average loan and an annual supervisory fee of 0.25 percent of the
outstanding balance of each sub-loan;
*     Interest on sub-loans, appraisal fees, and supervisory fees constitute the only sources
of income for the NPAF;



180                                                        Environmental Management Project
*     70 percent of all net income is retained by the NPAF and used to finance additional
sub-loans on the same terms and conditions as the initial sub-loans; the remaining 30
percent of net income is transferred to the Ministry of Finance;
*     NPAF expenses consist of the following items;
A commitment fee of 0.25 percent which is payable on the undisbursed
portion of the $50 million World Bank loan to the NPAF;
Interest of 7.25 percent payable on the disbursed portion of the $50 million
World Bank loan;
For purposes of the financial projections, annual operating costs are
conservatively estimated to be $1.145 million per year and are assumed to
increase at a rate of 3 percent per annum. Actual operating costs may be
somewhat lower, depending on the availability of lower cost local personnel
to conduct the technical appraisals and the success of the initial screening
review in minimizing the number of technical appraisals that do not result in
loan commitments.
2.     Annual operating costs consist of the following items:
*     Salaries, rent, and general operating expenses of $715,000;
*     Appraisal costs are $28,500 per appraisal. The NPAF appraises 15 projects per year,
of which 10 result in financeable projects and 5 result in rejected applications.
3.     Table A4.2 presents the 17 year operating results for the NPAF. The projections indicate that
the NPAF would incur cumulative operating losses of approximately $1.5 million during the first two
years and would generate its first operating profit in the third year. Table A4. 1 shows that the rate
of disbursement of funds for this base case is close to the IBRD standard profile for lines of credit.

TYPICAL PROJECT CONCEPTS
1.           The following is a list of typical pollution resource recovery pollution abatement
projects, which are all considered to be commercially viable. A more detailed list is currently being
compiled by the consultants that are working on the setting up of the NPAF.
2.          (a) Copper Dust Recovery. This potential project involves the recovery of dust from
a Nickel Smelter in the Murmansk region (Kola Peninsular) containing high concentrations of copper
and other toxic heavy metals and processing the dust to produce a high grade copper product for
export using a closed circuit low pollution recovery process. Appropriate cost of the project $20
million. Possible loan amount from the NPAF is $5 million for import of foreign technology and
equipment.
3.          (b)  Hydrocarbon Vapor Recovery.  Another project involves the recovery of
hydrocarbon vapors from large crude oil tank farms, which are currently being emitted to atmosphere
causing severe health and safety problems because of the toxicity of the vapors and their high
flammability. Investments in the range US$2-4 million may be required depending on the size of the
tank farm, of which there are possibly ten or more large scale ones in the Russian Federation.
Possibly up 100,000 metric tons/year of light fraction hydrocarbons can be captured as these sites and
processed at nearby refineries.
4.          (c) Copper Recovery from Waste Tailings. In the Urals region, waste tailings from
the mining and processing of iron ore contains high concentrations of copper (of equivalent ore grade),
which are currently being deposited in large tailings ponds. Due to natural oxidation processes and
action of sulphur oxidizing bacteria, the copper leaches of out of the tailings and contaminates surface
and ground waters. Using modern copper ore flotation methods with biodegradable low toxicity
flotation chemicals in closed cycle water circuits these copper ores can be separated to produce a high
grade copper concentrate. Through a tolling arrangement with a Russian smelter the copper
concentrate can be converted to a high grade copper product for export.
5.          (d) Oil Recovery. In some oil producing regions of Tyumen Oblast it is estimated
that up to 60 percent of the surface land and water resources are contaminated by oil spills. The sites
have a very considerable resource recovery potential using modem technology for oil spill recovery
and decontamination. Several technologies will be evaluated on a pilot basis under the World Bank
Second Oil Rehabilitation Loan. Investment will be needed to procure the most preferred technology
for a full scale project in one of the oil producing areas and recovered oil would be exported to
provide the revenue stream for repayment of the NPAF loan.
6.           The EMP Hazardous Waste Component includes a number of enterprise specific waste
related environmental management studies that will be offered as opportunities for donor funding. In
addition to being demonstrations of how improved waste management practices can be applied in



Annex 4.2                                                                            185
polluting industrial sectors for emulation elsewhere in the Russian Federation, these studies will be
designed to assist the particular enterprises involved in qualifying for financing from the National
Pollution Abatement Facility. The specific enterprises have been selected based on their future
viability and their ability to enhance productivity, profitability and export potential through the
application of clean technologies and resource recovery techniques in implementing improved waste
management practices. The scope of the study work to be undertaken will focus on identification of
key investments for technological change and/or infrastructure additions, evaluation of the economic
and environmental enhancements these may offer, and their documentation in the form of creditable
business plans and financing proposals. The following provides a brief overview of one such
enterprise with good prospects of meeting the qualification criteria of the NPAF.
Tula Catdge Works - Tul. This enterprise has been a major defense industry that
is now a joint stock company, which has converted approximately 80 percent of its
production capacity from munitions to consumer and industrial products, such as
vacuum cleaners, table ware, valves, chains, bellows and photographic equipment.
It is a major generator of metal finishing wastes, notably those from electroplating,
as are a number of other similar enterprises in the area. Recognizing both the
environmental impact of these waste discharges and the potential to develop a service
capability for the regions industry, they have identified the possibility to develop a
commercial treatment facility for heavy metals recovery that would service a sizeable
regional market.

NATIONAL POLLUTION ABATEMENT FACILITY
ENVIRONMENTAL GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURESaI
A.    INTRODUCTION
1.            Even though at first sight it may be considered unnecessary to provide environmental
guidelines for a so called "National Pollution Abatement Facility", there are in fact three critical
considerations in relation to this "Facility" which require special environ,mental consideration: (i)
pollution abatement projects (even those concerned with resource recovery) can cause adverse
secondary environmental impacts if carried out in an inappropriate manner; (ii) potential for
environmental liability for on-going or past operations at the proposed site; and (iii) an evaluation of
the net environmental benefits accruing from the proposed project against the selection criteria and/or
priorities established for the NPAF.
2.            The first step in the environmental review process is an environmental screening of
projects, followed by an environmental analysis if the screening review shows a positive indication
for some or all of the three factors described above. However, a positive indication for item (iii) is
a necessary condition to proceed with any further processing of the project.
B.   ENVIRONMENTAL SCREENING OF PROJECTS
3.            Environmental screening is the process of deciding at an early stage what
environmental analysis, if any, will be required for a project. Screening will be carried out by an
environmental expert engaged by the Facility; screening of an average manufacturing project should
take an expert no more than four hours to complete if the initial project documentation is reasonably
complete.
4.            An outline of the screening memorandum to be used by the NPAF is shown in Annex
4.4.1. The screening process categories projects according to whether or not they need an
environmental assessment (A, B, or C), whether or not they need an environmental audit (1 or 0), or
whether it meets the environmental criteria established for project selection (yes or no). If the last
factor is positive, the screening should provide a clear description of the environmental analysis
required, and also indicate where the expert believes it necessary to bring in any additional expertise.
Screening results will be documented in the Environmental Screening Memorandum. The NPAF will
bear the cost of the environmental screening process.
24/ These Environmental Guidelines and Procedures in their fmal form will become part of the Operations Instructions for the NPAF. They
are consistent with the approach outlined in the European Bank's document "Conducting Environmental Due Diligence on Financial Intermediary
Projects", December 1993.



196                                                        Environmental Management Project
C.    ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
5.            The analysis, where required, will take the form of an environmental selection criteria
analysis, an environmental assessment and/or an environmental audit. As with the screening process,
environmental analysis will be performed by the experts engaged by the NPAF, and as necessary by
any additional specialists.
6.            Only those projects meeting the environmental selection criteria will be further
processed by the NPAF. Since the objective of the Facility is to select projects which significantly
reduce the environmental impacts of existing operations and which recover valuable resources, a
matrix has been devised (see Annex 4.4.2) to assist in this evaluation using a qualitative approach.
As a first screening, the project will be scored against the four principle categories designated by a
(P) in the first column of this matrix. A project would need to achieve a minimum of one "B"
weighing within the (P) categories. Such projects would then be scored against the subsidiary
categories designated as (S) in the first column of the matrix. Projects would be ranked as follows:
projects scoring more than three "A"s out of a maximum of seven would be categorized "Highest
Priority"; and projects scoring zero "A"s would be categorized "Lowest Priority", while those with
scores in-between these two extremes would be designated "Medium Priority". Projects in the
"highest" and at the top of the "medium" priority range would meet the selection criteria for the
Facility. Those in the lower range of the "medium" priority would need further evaluation while those
in the "lowest" priority range would fail to meet the criteria for project selection. As work progresses
under the Policy and Regulatory Support Component of EMP, however, the selection criteria
methodology will be further refined to better reflect the Russian Federation's priorities in addressing
industrial pollution control by sector and by region.
7.            An environmental assessment (EA) is an environmental study conducted to identify,
predict, evaluate, and mitigate the environmental impacts which may arise from the proposed project.
The purpose of the EA is to recognize environmental consequences early in a project cycle, so that
they can be taken into account in project design.  EAs identify ways of improving projects
environmentally by minimizing, mitigating or compensating for adverse impacts. An environmental
assessment will also include a description of the appropriate steps, if any, for public consultation on
the project. The scope of an environmental assessment will vary widely depending on the nature and
location of a project, and it is difficult to give accurate guidance on how long they will take and
therefore the associated costs. For environmental assessment purposes, projects will be categorized
in respect to their level of assessment as Category A, B, or C (Category C projects are most unlikely
to seek financing from the Facility but are included here for completeness).
8.            Category A Projects. Projects will be designated as Category A Projects in the event
that they are deemed to have the potential to cause a significant environmental impact. Category A
projects will require a full EA, a sample outline of which is attached as Annex 4.4.3. Projects that
are likely to be designated as Category A are those that have the potential to cause environmental
impacts outside of the immediate area of the project, and/or those which are in one of the industries
listed in Annex 4.4.3 (Schedule A). The NPAF will require that the investee company carry out a
full EA for Category A projects. Additionally, the Facility will require that the investee company,
in the case of Category A projects, notifies the affected public and local government authorities to
identify their concerns associated with the project as a first step in conducting the EA. Investee
companies would also be required to meet national regulations in relation to consultation with the
public and local government authorities, and for Environmental Impact Review by the competent
Russian authority.



Annex 4.5                                                                           197
9.            Category B Projects. Category B Projects are similar to those in Category A.
However, in the case of Category B projects, impacts can be readily identified and remedial measures
prescribed without the need for a full EA. Category B Projects will require a partial environmental
analysis, which is more limited in scope than a full EA and may involve, for example, specifying how
a project will meet environmental guidelines developed by local or national authorities.
Recommendations are to be consistent with environmental regulations and legislation. Projects are
likely to be designated as Category B projects if they are in one of the sectors listed in Schedule B of
Annex 4.4.3. The Facility will require with respect to Category B Projects that the investee company
carry out all requirements for public disclosure and participation in accordance with local and national
law.
10.          Category C Projects. Category C Projects are those which are deemed to have no
apparent potential environmental impact, and will not normally require an EA to be carried out.
Projects are likely to be designated as Category C Projects if they are in one of the sectors listed in
Schedule C of Annex 4.4.3 and are therefore, unlikely to be brought to the NPAF.
11.          An environmental audit is conducted to evaluate potential environmental liabilities
with on-going operations. It is usually necessary where a project involves the acquisition of a fixed
asset; under legislation currently being formulated in the Russian Federation, the new owner of the
asset is responsible for environmental liabilities when incurred prior to the transaction. The audit
identifies potential environmental concerns such as contaminated land on the site, lack of compliance
with national standards, inadequate safety procedures, etc. An environmental audit of a general
manufacturing facility typically involves a site visit by a 2 person team for 4-5 days, including the
preparation of a report and should cost in the order of US$4,000, if carried out by local consultants.
If contamination is found, and further work is required, the time and costs involved will obviously
rise. A standard format for environmental audits is shown in Annex 4.4.4.
D.  DETERMINATION OF OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION
REQUIREMENTS
12.          There may be opportunities in projects not requiring an audit or assessment to
incorporate environmental measures which would enhance the project without reducing efficiency.
Information concerning such opportunities may be requested from the investee.
E.    COMMISSIONING ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS AND AUDITS
13.          Any entity, in which the Facility is proposing to invest and which has been found
through the screening procedure to require an environmental assessment or audit, will be required by
the Facility to commission such an analysis by environmental consultants with the necessary
capabilities at the expense of the investee company.
14.          Projects shall not be required to be assessed or audited as provided for in these
guidelines where the Facility is satisfied that the investee company has already carried out such
assessment or auditing, using environmental consultants of international standing. The Facility or its
independent consultant will review any such environmental assessments or audits to determine if they
are satisfactory as per the environmental review guidelines below.



198                                                       Environmental Management Project
F.   REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OR AUDIT
15.          As part of the investment process, the Facility shall ensure that:
i)    environmental analysis carried out in respect of a contemplated investment is reviewed
by the Facility and that environmental issues, including the status of public
participation, are documented in the investment file (a suggested format for
documenting the review is contained in the Environmental Review Memorandum
attached in Annex 4.4.5); and
ii)    conditions of compliance with any recommendations or implementation schedules
contained in the environmental analysis are appropriately defined and negotiated with
the investee company and, where appropriate, are incorporated into investment
agreements.
16.          The NPAF shall determine that both of the above have been satisfactorily completed
before deciding to proceed with an investment. The Facility will take all steps to monitor and ensure
compliance as are reasonable, having regard to the status of the Fund as a minority investor and the
circumstarces ef the investee company. The Fund shall not be obliged to disinvest in any instance
of non-compliance which comes to its attention.
17.          The NPAF shall ensure that a summary report is made available to the World Bank
with respect to environmental ana!ysis completed for any project in which an investment is made.
G.  NEGOTIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL COVENANTS WITH BORROWERS
18.          A description of any such covenants should similarly be provided in the loan proposal.
H.    SUPERVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS
19.          Where environmental covenants have been agreed between the Facility and the
borrower or investee company, the Fund will need to take steps to ensure that, along with legal and
financial covenants, the environmental covenants are met during the life of the loan.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT: STANDARD REPORT FORMAT
EA reports analyze relevant and significant environmental issues to the degree of depth
and detail appropriate to the potential adverse effects of the project. The EA will be prepared in
consultation with the project designers and sponsors, and the affected commnunity (in accordance with
national regulations and legislation). The EA report provides information to support the design and
review of a project; is not a decision-making document in itself.
2.           The EA report should include:
An Executive Summary. The Summary should be prepared and submitted with the EA and
provides a concise statement of significant findings and recommended action for the project.
A Text containing the following elements:
i)    Project description in a geographic, ecological, social and temporal context,
and methodology for the EA;
ii)    Policy, legal and administrative framework within which the project is
situated;
iii)   Baseline data describing the project area and relevant physical, biological and
socio-economic conditions;
iv)    Discussion of steps taken to consult affected groups and interested parties, and
issues arising from the discussions.
v)    Environmental impacts. The beneficial and adverse environrental impacts
(including biological, physical, socio-economic impacts) likely to result from
the project should be identified, predicted and assessed in relation to
appropriate guidelines and standards. Impacts associated with construction
and operation of a project should normally be addressed separately. Impacts
should be assessed in quantitative terms wherever possible. The sensitivity
of the analysis to the quality and quantity of available data, key gaps in data
and other uncertainties should be discussed.
vi)    Measures to avoid or mitigate adverse impact and/or to enhance the
environmental benefits should be proposed.
vii)   Alternative approaches and options to the design, technology, location, size
and operations should be compared in environmental impact terms and
quantified, to the extent possible; and an indication should be given of the

main reasons for the choice recommended by the consultant, taking into
account the environmental effects;
viii)   A mitigation plan should be presented which proposes feasible and cost-
effective measures to avoid or to reduce adverse environmental impacts to
acceptable levels on a sustainable basis. This mitigation action plan should
provide details of work programs and schedules, capital and recurrent cost
estimates, institutional and training requirements which are in phase with all
stages of the project's implementation;
ix)    An assessment of the enviromnental and other relevant institutions associated
with the project, discussing their roles and capabilities as they relate to the
proposed project, should be provided, along with recommendations for
improvements.
x)     A monitoring plan should be submitted which addresses the monitoring of the
environmental impacts during and after project implementation, and the
performance of the mitigation measures which are part of any mitigation plan.
The plan should specify the type of monitoring, responsibility for monitoring,
costs and other inputs (e.g., training), and reporting requirements.

ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCEDURES
A.    ACCOUNTING
1.           The Project Accounts include expenditures financed directly by the World Bank and
expenditures financed by the government and project entities. The Center for Project Preparation and
Implementation (CPPI) would have an accounting and control system capable of reliably recording and
reporting all financial transactions. This system must consist of two ledgers; one for US$ receipts and
expenditures and another for local currency Government appropriations and expenditures and must be
operational when project expenditures begin, capturing all transactions related to the project on a
monthly basis.
2.           All disbursements from the IBRD loan must be recorded as receipts in the US$ ledger,
on the day that the disbursement is made. Any government budget appropriations must be recorded
as receipts for the month that they relate to, in the local currency ledger. The two monthly ledgers
would be prepared by CPPI no later than ten business days after the end of the month.
3.           The components would be consolidated in US$ equivalents and filed to be used for
reporting purposes at the end of the quarter. As statements of expenditure (SOEs) and a Special
Account (SA) will be used in this project, the CPPI would be requested to prepare and maintain, on
a monthly basis: (a) a schedule of SOE expenditures and amounts, and (b) a summary of the SA
account activity and reconciliation with the SA balance in the commercial bank account and the project
account.
B.    FINANCIAL REPORTING
4.           The World Bank requires the financial performance and status of a project to be
monitored regularly during implementation, either during the period of loan disbursement or
throughout the life of the loan. The CPPI would provide quarterly and annual Project Accounts, and
reporting on the cash receipts and expenditures related to each component and the overall financial
performance of the project. The Project Accounts would not only include expenditures directly
financed by the World Bank, but also the expenditures financed by the government and project
entities. These reports would reflect actual component activity versus planned expenditure for the
most recent fiscal quarter, fiscal year-to-date and project inception-to-date. The format and individual
classification of receipts and expenditures were discussed and agreed upon between the Russian
Government and the World Bank during negotiations (Attachments 1 and 2).
5.           The quarterly reports will be summarized in a Consolidated Statement of Project
Receipts and Expenditures prepared using the US$ combined amounts. The consolidated report would
be rolled up from each sub-component, prepared using the US$ combined amounts (the summation
of the US$ receipts and expenditures, and the local currency receipts and expenditures translated to
US$ equivalents.)

ANNEX 7.3
CENTER FOR PROJECT PREPARATION AND IMPLEMETATION
TERMS OF REFERENCE
1.    The Center for Project Preparation and Implementation (CPPI), as a separate legal entity,
established under The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MEPNR) Order and following
regulations contained in that Order, will be responsible for acting as service agency and a resource
center to facilitate preparation and implementation of the Technical Assistance components of the
World Bank-financed Environmental Management Project (EMP) as well as projects financed under
the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and other sources of funding from the intemational
community. The EMP comprises several components as follows:
1. Technical Assistance
1.1   Policy and Regulatory Support;
1.2   Environmental Epidemiology;
1.3    Water Quality and Water Resource Management;
1.4    Hazardous Waste Management;
2. National Pollution Abatement Facility; and
3. The Center for Project Preparation and Implementation.
2     Responsibility for project preparation and implementation will lie with the subcomponent
implementing agencies, both in Moscow and in the regions; the CPPI's role will be to support
implementation entities in these tasks in the following areas;
(a)    Liaison;
(b)    Procurement;
(c)    Disbursement;
(d)    Reporting, Accounting and Auditing:
(e)   Information exchange; and
(f)    Policies conceming the above.
The CPPI will be assisted by a consulting firm, hereinafter called the Project Management
Advisory (PMA) firm, engaged following the World Bank Guidelines on the Use of Consultants under
a separate Terms of Reference.
3.    Liaison:      The CPPI will provide liaison with donors, ministries, other public entities and
the Subcomponent Implementing Team (SITs) (and other entities already set up, or to be created to
manage project components) on project activities. Such liaison will include facilitating the interaction
of concerned entities and the provision of information as described in paragraph 7. In this regard,
the CPPI will be the consolidated repository for project information and data which it will make
available to concerned entities in appropriate formats. Also the CCPI will assist the MEPNR and the
regions in organizing and coordinating seminars and workshops to disseminate project progress, results



Annex 7.3                                                                        219
and lessons learned, both for the Russian Government, NGO and public audiences, and for non-
Russian interested entities.
4.    Procurement:  The CPPI will have general responsibility (and delegation of responsibility)
for the administration of the procurement of equipment, goods and services required for the Technical
Assistance components of the project (paragraph 1). In undertaking procurement of equipment and
goods, the CPPI will follow the World Bank Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits and, for selecting and employing professional services, will follow the Guidelines for the Use
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency. The CPPI
will also be familiar with and will follow the procurement provisions of the PPF Agreement Letter
and the Loan Agreement. In undertaking procurement activities, the CPPI will be assisted by the
Project Management Advisory firtn as noted in paragraph 1. The specific responsibilities and
arrangements for procurement will be as follows;
(i)    Equipment and Goods: The CPPI will have the responsibility for procuring all the
equipment required for the Technical Assistance Components and for the start up
equipment for the National Pollution Abatement Facility. In general, the equipment
to be procured will follow the lists given in the Procurement Annex to the IBRD Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR). However, as project preparation and implementation
progresses there may be amendments to these lists. The CPPI should consolidate the
lists, prepare specifications and confirm with implementing agencies and project
managers, that the specifications meet the needs of the project component. Wherever
possible, equipment needs should be combined in packages with ICB being used for
all packages with estimated values of over US$300,000. Some equipment will be
required later in the project cycle and if the equipment specifications are agreed, then
the CPPI should use its best judgement to determine whether: (a) to include this as
part of early packages with delayed delivery timed to best meet the needs of the
project; (b) procure with the bulk of the equipment and either store or deliver early
to the appropriate agency (bearing in mind possible security risks); or (c) whether to
procure the equipment separately when needed. Packages with an estimated value of
under US$300,000 may be procured through International Shopping. Local shopping
may be used for supplies and minor items readily available locally and, where bulk
procurement would not be more economical. Local shopping may be delegated to the
SITs, which may set up small imprest accounts to be funded by the CPPI.
(ii)   The selection and employment of professional services: The CPPI will act as a
service agency and facilitator for the selection and employment of professional
services. Such services may be provided from foreign and Russian sources by: (a)
consulting firms and individuals and (b) Institutes. Services also include hiring of
Russian Subcomponent Project Managers (SCPMs), both in Moscow and in the
regions and the Russian technical and support staff needed for the Project. In general,
all contracts for professional services will be signed with the CPPI, but professional
and technical supervision will be the responsibility of the SITs. For most contracts
with firms, payments will be made by the CPPI based on SIT or SCPM authorized
estimates of cash flow, with reconciliation taking place on a "trailing month" basis.
Depending on the location and organizational structure, payments (or salaries) for
individuals may be made as for firms, or may be made by SITs or SCPMs on a
payroll basis with the CPPI advancing funds to meet the payrolls in a timely manner.
For this purpose, agencies will be required to set up accounting procedures acceptable
to the CPPI (and the IBRD) and in compliance with Government regulations. Terms



220                                                        Environmental Management Project
of Reference (TOR) and job descriptions for services will be prepared by the entity
which is implementing and/or managing the services to be performed. The CPPI will
provide advice and dissemination of experience on the preparation of TORs. Selection
of consulting firms will be through evaluation of proposals received from a shortlist
of firms (not less than three, no more than six). Selection of individuals will be
through the evaluation of at least three CVs. The CPPI will provide support to
Selection Committees (SC) by assisting in the preparation of long lists of firms from
which the SC will choose the short list. Selection committees will usually be
convened by the SIT, or appropriate SCPM. While the CPPI will be represented on
selection committees, the majority of SC members should be involved with project
implementation. The CPPI will handle the mailing of the invitation package to the
shortlisted firms and receiving and recording the proposals. Given its rapid build up
of experience, the CPPI should jointly with the SCPM, negotiate contracts with the
consulting firms. Individual contracts will be negotiated by their supervisors on the
basis of a standard scale of salaries and conditions. In general, the CPPI will have the
right of "no objections" for higher level staff. For both firms and individuals,
standard contracts will be used. For firms this will be the World Bank Standard
Contract; for individuals, the standard individual contract of the CPPI. While the
MEPNR as the Bank's Borrower is responsible for the overall success of the project,
responsibility for a consultant's performance will lie with the SIT delegated to
supervise and administer the consultant's tasks. Such delegation will be in writing -
copy to the consulting firm or individual.
(iv)   Training and Advice: Based on the Bank's guidelines, the CPPI will prepare a
procurement manual which should amplify the procedures given in the Guidelines and
explain in detail the responsibilities and procedures to be followed by the Project
SITs. The CPPI will also provide training in professional services selection and
contract administration. The CPPI will maintain a library of terms of reference, job
descriptions, and contract documentation and will build up a data base of information
on consulting firms. The CPPI will also assist in the administrative matters related
to training workshops to be mounted by the implementing agencies and with training
and secondments overseas.
(v)    World Bank's Prior Review: The Bank's review for procurement of equipment and
goods for all contracts over US$300,000 (ICB) is detailed in Appendix 1 to the
Procurement Guidelines i.e. the Bank would need to review and give its no objections
to the complete bid package prior to bids being invited (including the proposed
advertisement) and the proposed contract award with a detailed report covering bid
opening and evaluation. For professional services where firms or institutes are being
invited, the Bank would need to give its "no objections" to the short list of firms to
be invited to submit proposals and the invitation package. Prior to negotiation, the
Bank would wish to receive the recommendations of the evaluation committee the with
the winning proposal, and the proposed negotiated contract prior to signature.
5.    Disbursement: The CPPI will be responsible for the disbursement of funds, the preparation
of withdrawal applications and the collection, maintenance of all relevant documents. The
Disbursement Handbook which details disbursement procedures for IBRD Loans, provides the
information on procedures and should be considered a part of these Terms of Reference. Withdrawal
applications will be fully documented, except for expenditures against contracts less than US$50,000



Annex 7.3                                                                        221
equivalent which will be made on certified Statements of Expenditures detailing the individual
transactions. The documents to support these expenditures will be retained by the CPPI for at least
one year after the receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement
was made. This documentation will be made available for review by the auditors (see sections below
on "Reporting, Accounting and Auditing") and the Bank upon request.
6.    Project Preparation Facility: A PPF has been approved to finance some of the activities
related to the start-up of project implementation including the PMA and CPPI equipment to facilitate
the start-up of the CPPI and other project preparation activities. The CPPI will be responsible for the
operation of the Special Account which has been opened to facilitate the disbursement of PPF funds
in accordance with IBRD requirements.
7.    Reporting, Accounting and Auditing: The CPPI will establish a management information
system which, at a minimum, will cover:
(a)    All equipment and goods procurement activities;
(b)    All consultants and personnel employed under the Project;
(c)    All financial activities including payments and disbursements;
(d)    Project preparation and progress using appropriate CPM and PERT systems;
(e)    An accounting system following generally accepted international standards in order
to provide information on the receipt and use of funds and in line with the terms of
the PPF and the Loan Agreements. The system would ensure timely and accurate
accounting of all transactions under the PPF and the Loan, and a clear presentation
of financial information. It should enable identification of the use of all funds by
components and categories of equipment and goods procured and consultants and
personnel employed and paid under the project. The accounting system should reflect
the movement and receipts and payments through the Special Account with balances
agreed with monthly financial statements form the holding commercial bank and with
periodic statements from the World Bank; and
(f)    An auditing system to meet the requirements of the Government of the Russian
Federation and the World Bank.
Detailed requirements for the above, including the determination of responsibilities for the
provision of data and reports on subprojects, will be developed during the 6 month start-up phase of
the CPPI.
8.    Information Exchange:  The CPPI will ensure the organization and management of
information reporting and database maintenance to meet the needs of the project and donors and
lenders participating in the project. Information management will include that developed by the
systems in paragraph 7 above and will also include written reports, both as specified under the Loan
Agreement, but also as required for the dissemination of information to entities of the Government
of the Russian Federation, donors and to the participants in the project -- particularly those in the
regions.
9.    Employment of Personnel: The CPPI will develop personnel employment policies to ensure



222                                                       Environmental Management Project
appropriate consistency by all the project participants. Over and above the employment activities as
indicated in paragraph 4 above, the CPPI will engage individual experts for the purpose of staffing
the CPPI in accordance with the CPPI organizational chart attached.
10.   Development of CPPI Policies and Procedures: The detailed functions of the CPPI and its
structure, policies and operations will evolve over time -- particularly during the start-up phase. These
Terms of Reference provide a starting point for the CPPI operations. However, it is expected that
they will be revised, amplified and amended from time to time to more adequately meet the needs of
the project.

SrAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RUSSIAN FEDERATION
EN4VRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PaOinCr
ANNEX 9.1
PROCUREMENT PLAN
I. TECHNICAL ASSISIANCE COMPONENTS
A.    General
1.    Procurement Administration.  The procurement plan and schedule for the project are
summarized in Table A9. 1.1. The CPPI will be responsible for all equipment procurement and for
the administrative aspects of the employment of consultants in accordance with the Loan Agreement.
In meeting this responsibility, the CPPI will be assisted by a Project Management Advisory (PMA)
firm and one of the firm's first tasks will be assist in setting up procedures, and training staff in
detailed procurement planning and scheduling, preparation of documents, inviting bids and quotations,
setting up procedures for receipt, public opening and recording of bids, evaluation, awarding of
contracts, and complying with the Bank's review and "no objections" requirements. The PMA will
also assist in setting up the CPPI office and computer equipment.
2.    Procurement Planning.  Typical procurement schedules covering ICB equipment and
consultant selection are given in the Project Implementation Manual. These schedules are consistent
with those being used on other Bank projects in the Russian Federation. Specific equipment and
consultant procurement schedules are also given in the Project Implementation Manual. Over time,
the CPPI will refine these schedules based on actual experience.
B.    Equipment
3.    Equipment procurement will be timed to meet the needs of the particular component. Thus,
while it might seem attractive to procure all computers in one package, because of storage difficulties
and possible security risks, some computers will be procured later in the implementation phase. The
alternative of phased delivery by the supplier might not allow users to take advantage of technology
upgrading.
4.    Documents.  The Bank's standard bidding documents in english will be used for the
procurement of equipment. These are available in Russian and will be held on computer by the CPPI.
5.    Methods of Procurement. Packages of equipment above US$300,000 will be procured
through ICB. Russian manufacturers competing under ICB would receive a preference in bid
evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price, or the prevailing customs duty applicable to non-exempt
importers, whichever is the less, providing the value added to the product exceeds 20 percent of the
ex-factory bid price. For equipment and goods below an estimated contract value of US$300,000,
procurement will be through International Shopping.  Local shopping may be used for items and
packages below US$10,000 including regular office and technical supplies.
6.    Annex 9.2 lists the equipment to be procured for the project (excluding NPAF sub-loans).
The CPPI will prepare all regular office equipment specifications. However, because of their
specialist nature, specifications for technical equipment (e.g. monitoring and epidemiological



236                                                       Environmental Management Project
equipment) wi]l be prepared by the technical consultants for the subcomponents. The timing of
specification preparation is given in the relevant equipment procurement schedules.
7.    The project will require three different levels of computer. First, "scientific" level computers
will be required for the Enviromnental Epidemiology and NPAF components. These will require high
level, open operating systems of the UNIX type, or equivalent. They will also be using software for
which annual license fees are required. Second, most Subcomponent Implementation Agencies also
require computers with fast operating systems (586, Pentium or equivalent), 8MB RAM and memory
well in excess of 200MB. These have been termed "higher level" computers. Third, offices will
require both stand alone and linked "workstations".
8.    Depending on the size of the packages, most computer procurement will be through ICB and
will require specifications which allow reputable suppliers to bid. However, there are specific
requirements for the project computers. All the workstation computers must be capable of running
the same applications, interchanging data in a compatible format and, in some cases, sharing the same
applications. Higher level computers must also be capable of running workstation applications plus
those for which they are designed. Thus, all operating systems must be compatible and must also be
able to run MS-DOS applications. The computers must also be able to run widely recognized word
processing, spreadsheet, project management and data base applications. It would also be an
advantage if these applications were identical or compatible with those used by the Bank. Thus, while
the computer's operating system will not be specified, its required characteristics will be based on the
above requirements.
9.    Given the "off the shelf" nature of the higher level and workstation computers, a two stage
bidding procedure will not be adopted. However, technical merit will be taken into account in the
evaluation of bids.  The technical merit parameters will include (inter alia): speed of processor
running applications designed for it and also running in an "emulation" mode for other applications;
the length of time the supplier has been in business; and the servicing arrangements in Russia.
10.   Component equipment lists are given in the Project Implementation Manual.
11.    The Bank's Prior Review Requirements. For equipment procured for the Technical Assistance
Component of EMP: for all contracts greater than US$100,000, the Bank's prior review will be as
specified in Appendix 1 to the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
C.     Consulting Firms Contracts
12.   A list of the major consulting firm assignments is given in Annex 9.3.
13.   Procedures and Administration. Consultants will be selected and employed in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The CPPI will be responsible for developing
and administering this policy and will produce detailed procedures which all Subcomponent
Implementing Team (SITs) will follow. However, the procedures will be designed such that the
subcomponent management Committee (SCMC), SIT and subcomponent project manager (SCPM) will
have the major input into the actual selection of consulting firms and the professional management of
their contracts. Thus the CPPI will be responsible for administrative aspects of the selection and
employment process and for the routine administration of consultant contracts, with the SCPM being:
(a) responsible for the professional management of the consulting firm's assignment; and (b) the
recipient of the consulting firm's output.



Annex 9.1                                                                          237
14.    Estimated Costs. For budget purposes, foreign consulting services have been estimated on
the basis of US$15,000/month (US$20,000/month for managers) inclusive of social costs, overhead,
fee and overseas allowance. An additional amount of US$13,000/month has been allowed for living
costs, foreign and local travel and contingencies. Russian consulting firm rates have been estimated
at US$2,000-2,500/month.
15.    Consultants' Terms of Reference. The status of preparation of terms of reference for the
major consulting assignments is given in the Project Implementation Manual. Prior to inviting
proposals and, with the exception of the policy subcomponent training consultants, the terms of
reference for each subcomponent technical assistance assignment will be reviewed by the General
Consultant Firm (expected to be appointed September 1994), in conjunction with the SCMCs, SITs
and the SCPMs, and cleared by the Bank. The terms of reference for assignments later in the project
cycle will be drafted nearer the time when they are required.
16.   Selection Procedures. Above an estimated value of US$100,000, proposals will be invited
from a short list of consulting firms. Proposal evaluation will be on technical merit. However, a
budget for the assigmnent will be included in the Letter of Invitation as outlined in the Bank's
Guidelines.
17.   Selection Committees. Selection Committees will be convened by the SCMC responsible for
the assignment in accordance with CPPI procedures. The SCMC will work closely with the CPPI in
conducting the affairs of the Selection Committee. The CPPI will act as a resource, will provide
administrative support for the Committee, and will be represented on the Committee. However, the
appropriate SCMC will have majority representation on a Selection Committee.
18.   Data on Consulting Firms. The CPPI will be responsible for building and maintaining data
on consulting firms. The Bank will make available to the CPPI data from the Dacon system. The data
will also be made available to SCMCs, SITs, SCPMs and to the management staff of the NPAF.
19.   Documents. The Banks standard documentation will be used for consultant selection and
employment. The documents are available in Russian and, as for equipment, will be held on the CPPI
computer data base. The budget for the CPPI includes for the translation into Russian of the Bank's
Handbook on the Use of Consultants.
20.   Contracts.  In general, contracts with consulting firms will be of four years duration.
However, a contract over two years duration will include a provision requiring a major review after
the first 21 months to assess the consulting firm's performance and to determine the need for and/or
scope of the future work.
21.    Bank's Prior Review Requirements. For all consulting firm contracts over US$100,000 the
Bank would wish to receive for its review and clear the following:
Prior to Invitation.
(i)    The short list of firms proposed to be invited for an assignment;
(ii)   The Invitation Package including;



238                                                        Environmental Management Project
(a)   the proposed Terms of Reference and details of the assigmnent budget;
(b)   the Letter of Invitation and Supplementary Information for Consultants with
full details of the proposed evaluation procedure; and
(c)    Any variations from the Bank's standard contract.
Prior to contract Negotiations:
(a)    a copy of the winning proposal with the right to request copies of all
proposals if required.
Prior to contract signature:
(a)    a copy of the proposed contract with the final terms of reference.
After contract signature:
(a)   two confirmed copies of the signed contract.
D.    Contracts With Individual Consultants
22.    General. The costs of project personnel specifically engaged to prepare and implement the
project will be financed under the project. The project personnel include the Director and staff of the
CPPI, the SCPMs and SIT staff, and individual experts advising the SCMCs.
23.   Policies. The CPPI will be responsible for developing personnel policies such that there is
reasonable consistency in terms, conditions and benefits for all project consultants. A consultant scale
consistent with scales under other Bank financed projects, is currently under consideration by the
MEPNR.
24.    Selection. Selection of consultants under individual contracts will be on the basis of three CVs
with the selection being made by the SCMC. For higher level positions, the "no objections" of the
CPPI will be required. The Bank's "no objections" are required for all individual consultant contracts.
25.    Contracts. A contract for the employment of the Director of the CPPI (in Russian and
English) has been agreed with the Bank and, with appropriate modifications, will be used as a basis
for all individual consultant contracts. Where individual Russian and foreign experts will be employed
on a sub contract basis with the main subcomponent technical assistance consultants, the latter's
contract will be designed to cover these subcontracts. Unlike contracts for the employment of
consulting firms, where the contracting party is the CPPI, most individual consultant contracts will
be with the SITs. Individual consultant contracts will be of one year's duration, but may be extended
by mutual agreement.
26.   Payroll. To facilitate Bank replenishments of the Special Account, the CPPI will set up a
payroll accounting system and require SITs to set up similar payroll accounting systems acceptable
to the CPPI and to the Bank. Rather than require documentation to support payment to each individual
consultant, the Bank will accept the documentation certified by the CPPI covering payroll accounts.
With the exception noted in para 24 the Bank will not require its prior review of specific individual
consultant contracts, but reserves the right to review such contracts on a random basis.



Annex 9.1                                                                        239
E.    Studies
27.   The project includes for studies to be undertaken under each component. While the general
scope of most of the studies are known, preparation of detailed terms of reference will be carried out
by the SCPMs, SITs and subcomponent consulting firms. Selection and employment of consultants
to carry out the studies will be in accordance with the CPPI's procedures and the Bank's guidelines.
F.    Training
28.   All four Project TA components include training activities. With the CPPI, the General
Consulting Firm will be the focal point for facilitating training activities to achieve economies of scale
and to avoid duplication of effort. Above US$100,000, proposals would be invited from at least three
training institutions and these would be evaluated as for consulting firm assignments with the Bank's
prior review requirements being met.
29.   The Project Implementation Manual includes equipment lists, costs, schedules and consultant
selection schedules.
II.    THE NATIONAL POLLUTION ABATEMENT FACILITY
30.   ProcurementAdministration. Detailed procurement procedures for NPAF sub-borrowers have
been agreed in accordance with the provisions of the Bank's Loan Agreement. The CPPI will be
responsible for procurement by NPAF sub-borrowers in close liaison with the Facility's core
consultants. The CPPI will also assist with the selection and appointment of consultants for the NPAF
and for its sub-borrowers. The Bank's standard procurement documents in Russian and English will
be used with appropriate modifications to reflect the NPAF as the financing agency and for sub-
borrowers.
31.   Methods of Procurement. ICB will followed for all procurement packages above a threshold
of US$2 million with Russian suppliers receiving a margin of preference as noted in paragraph 5
above. The ICB requirement will be independent of the NPAF's participation. Thus ICB will be
followed, even if the NPAF will finance only 30 percent of a package. Below the US$2 million ICB
threshold packages will be procured by International Shopping (see Annex 9.4 for a sample format
for International Shopping) on the basis of price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers from
at least three countries eligible under the Guidelines, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the
Bank. Below $10,000 per contract procurement will be by Local Shopping awarded on the basis of
a comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers from the Russian Federation
eligible under the Guidelines, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
32.   Items to be Procured. The items and packages to be procured are likely to be industrial in
nature. To maximize the impact of the NPAF in supporting pollution reduction and technology
improvement, the Facility is likely to target its financing for equipment and goods, leaving civil works
to be financed from the borrower's own resources. Where civil works are part of the equipment
package, this will be financed by the NPAF.
33.   The project will also finance office equipment for the NPAF; the equipment will be procured
for the Facility by the CPPI. The equipment is listed in the Project Implementation Manual.
34.   The Bank's Prior Review Requirements.  For each subloan the Bank would review all

documentation for procurement of equipment and goods over US$300,000 as detailed in Appendix 1
to the Procurement Guidelines, i.e. the Bank would need to review and give its no objections to the
complete bid package prior to bids being invited (including the proposed advertisement) and the
proposed contract award with a detailed report covering bid opening and evaluation.
35.   Consulting Firm Contracts. The NPAF will require its borrowers to follow its procedures
for the selection and employment of consultants. These procedures will follow the Bank's Guidelines
on the Use of Consultants. The NPAF will also follow the Bank's Guidelines when employing
technical assistance for its own use. Working with the CPPI, the NPAF will build up its own data base
on technical expertise and will use the Dacon information as an input.
36.   The Bank's Prior Renew Requirements. For consulting firm assignments over US$100,000
the Bank's review requirements would be as for other project consulting firm assignments as detailed
in paragraph 21 above.
