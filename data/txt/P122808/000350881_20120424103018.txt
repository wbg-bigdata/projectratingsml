         FOURTH AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION

Borrower              Republic of Ghana
Implementing          Ministry of Food and Agriculture
Agency
Financing Data        SDR 32.3 million (US$50 million equivalent)
                      Regular IDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace period
Operation Type        This is the second DPL operation in a second series (AgDPO 3, 4, and 5)
                      and is aligned with the new Medium Term Agriculture Sector Investment
                      Plan (METASIP) that was prepared, consistent with the African Union‟s
                      Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP).
Main Policy Areas     These are: (i) agriculture technology for improved on-farm productivity;
                      (ii) market and value chain development; (iii) irrigated agriculture and
                      other infrastructure services; (iv) fisheries; and (v) agriculture sector
                      management.
Key Outcome           These are (respectively, according to main policy areas above): Demand-
Indicators            driven research projects identified; quantity of seed produced; number of
                      dealers selling seed; value of non-traditional exports; value of agriculture
                      lending; off-farm agricultural storage capacity; public-private
                      management of public irrigation sites; number of new irrigation PPPs;
                      restricted issuing of new industrial fishing licenses; number of industrial
                      licensed trawlers; government agriculture budget composition and
                      execution rate.
Program               The operation is consistent with the CAS objective of supporting Ghana‟s
Development           poverty reduction strategy and in particularly „modernizing agriculture‟.
Objective(s) and      The program development objective is “to enhance productivity and
Contribution to CAS   market access among farmers, and to improve agriculture sector
                      management.?
Risks and Risk        The main risks are: (i) change in policy direction, away from private
Mitigation            sector-led, government-facilitated agriculture growth; (ii) exposure to
                      climate change; (iii) weaknesses in financial management and
                      coordination of sector-wide resource allocation; and (iv) political
                      feasibility risks related to the fiscal adjustment with new elections
                      looming; (v) external risks associated with a deteriorated global economic
                      environment.
                      Mitigation strategies to address these risks are as follows: (i) confirmation
                      of Government‟s continued commitment to prevailing agricultural policy
                      framework and investment program, and active engagement through the
                      CAADP and sector working group mechanisms; (ii) implementation of
                      the mitigation strategy of the WB/Global Facility for Disaster Reduction
                      and Recovery; (iii) intense engagement with the IMF on macroeconomic
                      management, and technical assistance to improved financial management
                      and coordination; (iv) implementation of PRSG8 and demand for good
                      governance activities supported by the World Bank; (v) Better initial
                      conditions and oil-related stabilization mechanisms would reduce the
                      impact of external shocks on the domestic economy and balance of

                 PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
PROPOSED FOURTH AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION
                     CREDIT TO GHANA


                                  I.     INTRODUCTION

1.      Structural transformation of Ghana's economy is ongoing. The contribution of
the country's services sector to the economy has overtaken that of the agricultural
sector, while the latter continues to grow strongly in absolute terms. Ghana's
agricultural sector is on a growth path and opportunities exist for significant further
development. Poverty levels are falling, and Ghana as a nation is largely food secure. While
rural poverty remains high in the northern regions of the country, agriculture sector
production and productivity have increased in the North during the past four years. Despite
these regional and national developments, further productivity gains are needed in order to
increase competitiveness, particularly as Ghana aims to strengthen its position as an
agricultural exporter. A new focus on private sector-led growth requires an approach that
includes smallholder farmers into value chains and facilitates agribusiness investments.
Good climatic conditions, a relatively stable investment climate, untapped agricultural
technologies, high agricultural commodity prices, and strong Government-development
Partner (DP) dialogue are key factors that will enable Ghana to continue improving the
performance of the agricultural sector.

2.      The proposed fourth agricultural development policy operation (AgDPO4) is a
single tranche credit for US$50 million equivalent and the second DPO in a series of
three, intended to help the Government of Ghana (GoG) implement the Medium
Term Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (METASIP). The METASIP represents a
Ghana-owned program for the implementation of the Comprehensive African Agricultural
Development Program (CAADP) in Ghana. It also provides an enhanced framework for
scaling up resources to agriculture - in particular, in line with G20 commitments at l'Aguila
and Pittsburgh - and for improved harmonization and alignment. The corresponding
METASIP, on which the current AgDPO series is based, was finalized in September 2010.

3.       The AgDPO series accommodates the Government's specific implementation
priorities. As reflected in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Progress Report, the
second AgDPO series constitutes a strategic response with the following expected benefits:
(i) it allows for close alignment of Bank support with the Government's agenda; (ii) it
provides for a compelling case to scale up assistance beyond the levels originally envisaged
in the CAS, in recognition of the financing gap identified in the investment program under
the CAADP framework (approximately US$150 million per year over five years); and (iii)
it facilitates alignment of specific policy measures to be supported with the Government's
policy and institutional reform agenda.

4.      The proposed operation supports the development objectives set in Ghana’s
poverty reduction strategy for 2010-2013, the Ghana Shared Growth and
Development Agenda (GSGDA). The GSGDA emphasizes the need for greater executive
efficiency, transparency and accountability to provide the adequate setting for the reduction
of poverty and socio-economic inequalities through agricultural, private sector,

                                             4
infrastructure and human resource development. The proposed operation is aligned with the
updated World Bank Group‟s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives for FY08-12.1
With an emphasis on productivity and competitiveness, investment climate, economic
vulnerability and resilience, partnerships, and finance, the AgDPO is well aligned with the
World Bank‟s Africa Regional Strategy. The AgDPO4 is consistent with the Bank's
strategic focus on country systems, and the Government's aid policy that seeks a greater
share of foreign assistance in the form of budgetary support.

5.     The proposed operation continues to supports the Government’s efforts to
address the development needs of the northern part of the country. To address the
regional discrepancy between the North and the South, the Government‟s policy measures
and agriculture programs are expected to have a disproportionately positive impact on the
poorer regions in Northern Ghana. For example, many measures support the development
of food grain production which dominates in the north compared to the south where cocoa
and other export (cash) crops are more prevalent. Fertilizer and seed technology adoption
programs focus on food commodities that are predominantly grown in the North (maize,
rice and sorghum) and will continue to contribute to agricultural productivity gains and
food production increases in that zone.

6.      The Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP II) forms the
basis of Ghana’s agriculture sector programs. It constitutes a sector policy that extends
beyond the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) and encompasses the mandates of all
ministries that are expected to contribute to agriculture sector outcomes.

7.      The METASIP is a sector-wide investment plan that embodies the
commitments made under the CAADP Compact. It includes activities among all
agriculture-related Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) based on the
classification of functions for the sector. It also anticipates activities of the private sector
and civil society and takes into account ongoing projects. As a sector investment plan,
emphasis has been on consultations and actions by all stakeholders of the sector: MoFA,
other relevant MDAs, DPs, NGOs, academia, civil society, farmers and other on-farm and
off-farm private sector operators, researchers and service providers. The implementation of
the METASIP is intended to drive the application of a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) to
bring on board sector stakeholders in effective coordination and participation.

8.      This programmatic series of sector development policy operations is
complementary to macro-level budget support coordinated under the Multi-Donor
Budget Support (MDBS) framework, to which the Bank contributes through the
Poverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSG8). The PRSG and the MDBS are not
appropriate instruments to deepen the sector level policy dialogue as they necessarily focus
on cross-cutting issues including public financial management (PFM) and economic
governance. At the same time, the Government is yet to fully address budget needs at the
sector level, relying predominantly on DP-financed investment projects. While these
investments are contributing to faster agricultural growth and export diversification, a key
objective of the AgDPO series is to strengthen the Government's ability to plan sector-wide
resource allocation and implement using its own budgetary resources.

                                   II.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

                     A.       RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

9.      The Government that assumed office in January 2009 inherited a difficult
macro-economic situation, brought on by a series of shocks which exacerbated a structural
trend of widening fiscal imbalances. Rapid fiscal expansion in 2008 and constrained access
to international capital markets in September 2008 resulted in a widening current account
deficit and a contracting capital account surplus, reducing the stock of gross foreign
currency reserves at the Bank of Ghana to less than 2.3 months of imports. By end-2008,
fiscal (on a cash basis) and current account deficits, including grants, respectively
culminated at 8.5 and 10.9 percent of GDP. While fiscal expansion was prolonging trends
observed since 2005 – with a public sector wage bill to revenue ratio growing from 34 to 57
percent between 2004 and 2008 – it was also the result of a combination of severe
exogenous shocks, including floods and droughts in late 2007, a rise in world food prices,
which prompted the Government to introduce food tax exemptions, and a rise in oil prices,
which led the Government to purchase oil on behalf of utilities, in the absence of effective
tariff adjustment mechanisms. The electoral cycle also contributed to the fiscal expansion,
as observed during previous elections. Deficits and demand pressures strongly contributed
to the depreciation of the Ghana Cedi, which lost approximately 45 percent of its value
against the US dollar over June 2008 to June 2009, and to accelerated consumer price
inflation, which culminated at 20.7 percent (year-on-year) in June 2009.

10.     In response, the Government immediately adopted a multi-year fiscal
stabilization plan, to bring back the fiscal deficit and debt to GDP ratios to sustainable
levels by 2011. These intentions were reflected in the successive Budget Laws 2009, 2010
and 2011 approved by Parliament, targeting end-year fiscal deficits (on a cash basis) at 5.5,
4.3 and 4.1 percent of GDP in CY09, CY10 and CY11.

11.      While not meeting all initial expectations, progress to stabilize the economy was
nonetheless significant since 2009. Indeed, fiscal deficits exceeded budget targets in CY09
and CY10 (see Annex 2), deviations being particularly large in CY10. Chief among the
factors to explain such aggregate budget deviations was the progressive discovery of
Government outstanding financial commitments – and related expenditure arrears,
contracted before 2009 vis-à-vis private firms (for energy and road projects) and public
utilities, and their continued accumulation while effective commitment controls and cost-
recovery mechanisms were progressively implemented. Nonetheless, fiscal deficits were
significantly compressed, from 8.5 percent and 12.5 percent of GDP in 2008 on cash and
commitment basis respectively, to a projected 4.6 and 2.2 percent of GDP in 2011.
Improved revenue collection, contained primary expenditures (excluding the clearance of
arrears and debt service) and rapid growth contributed to improve the fiscal situation. The
contraction of the current account in the balance of payments, and the initial massive
support of international financial institutions in 20092, combined with favorable terms of
trade (declining oil prices, surging cocoa and gold prices) contributed to replenish foreign
currency reserves, stabilize the exchange rate, and contain imported inflation. Good

  The IDA Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit, the IMF Extended Credit Facility and the
decision from the G20 in March 2009 to raise special drawing rights (SDR) for developing countries in
response to the financial crisis allowed Ghana to benefit from a cumulated net inflow of US$700 million in
2009, which came in addition to earlier commitments.

                                                    7
domestic food production, reduced public demand and credit to private sector, also
contributed to lower consumer price inflation to single-digit levels and build positive
medium term expectations, thereby giving further credibility to the Bank of Ghana (BoG)
inflation targeting regime. As inflation was decelerating, the BoG reduced its policy rate
from 17.0 percent in December 2008 to 12.5 percent in October 2011. Meanwhile, interest
paid on 6-month Treasury bills went down from 26.3 to 9.8 percent over the same period.

12.     Following the sharp adjustment of 2009, GDP growth strongly rebounded in
2010 and 2011. As Government strongly compressed its demand in 2009, without being
immediately relayed by private domestic investors and consumers, economic growth
strongly decelerated in 2009 to 4.0 percent (down from 8.4 percent in 2008). It nonetheless
rapidly rebounded in 2010 to 7.7 percent, under the influence of various factors. First,
unlike 2009 (where fiscal compression cost 2.5-3.0 percentage points of foregone GDP
growth, not accounting for multiplier effects), public demand contributed positively to total
aggregate demand; second, growing export revenue (gold and cocoa) stimulated private
demand; third, the progressive resumption of credit to private sector and utilities restored
their ability to operate at full capacity; and fourth, the growing likelihood of first oil (which
eventually became a reality in December 2010, as planned) encouraged private operators to
invest and build stocks in anticipation of growing demand in 2011 (a projected 13.6 percent
real GDP growth). While declining in proportion of GDP (as services – ICT, construction,
and the oil industry grew faster over the same period), agricultural GDP growth, benefiting
from good rains and greater use of fertilizers, nonetheless remained largely positive in per
capita terms since 2008.

13.     Economic growth and the clearance of many public arrears contributed to
strengthen financial sector’s balance sheets, which nevertheless still remain fragile.
The adjustment of 2009 also concerned the financial sector (mostly constituted of banks),
which experienced in that year a strong deterioration of its assets, as the proportion of non-
performing loans (NPLs) in gross loans grew from 8 percent in December 2008 to 20
percent in February 2010. In retrospect, the rapid expansion of credit in 2007 and 2008 in a
high inflation and high interest rate environment created conditions for the subsequent asset
deterioration, as risk management regulations and practices did not improve
commensurately. Another major reason was the accumulation of public arrears impairing
banks‟ assets due directly to the build-up of public arrears to contractors and SOEs, and
indirectly to arrears to vendors not paid by the affected contractors and SOEs (see Table 1
and Annex 2). Beyond late releases (carryovers), projects arrears with contractors3
originated mostly from the relaxation of commitment controls since 2008 in energy, roads
& highway ministries, and the absence of a contracts database enabling proper multi-year
investment planning, while outstanding obligations to SOEs originated mostly from the
absence of cost-recovery mechanisms in utilities. Finally, the Consolidated Fund, although
legally bound, accumulated some arrears vis-à-vis Statutory Funds (Ghana Education Trust
Fund, Road Fund, District Assembly Common Fund, National Health Insurance Fund,
Social Security, HPIC and MDRI related funds). In total, arrears and outstanding
obligations rose from 6.0 percent of GDP in 2008 to 8.2 percent in 2010. In the event,
State-Owned Banks saw their financial situation deteriorate given their high exposure to

 Projects arrears are defined as outstanding payments not honored in due time after services (item 3 in the
budget economic classification) and investments expenditures (item 4 in the budget economic classification)
were delivered.

State-Owned Enterprises. Nevertheless, the clearance of a significant portion of arrears by
the Government in 2010 and 2011, and the expansion of balance sheets with growth
contributed to reduce the proportion of NPLs (to 16 percent in October 2011) and reduce
the prudential need for banks to provision them. Thus, banks progressively resumed credit
to the private sector, after it had stagnated in real terms from end-2008 until October 2010.
Besides, capital adequacy ratios were improved through higher capital requirements
fulfilled between 2009 and 2011.

14.     Since 2009, the Balance of Payments was strengthened. In 2010, the current
account widened, as import sharply rebounded from their low level of 2009 and in spite of
continued robust export growth and growing transfers. The current account deficit was
nonetheless more than financed by large capital inflows, including foreign direct
investments for the oil industry and bond purchases from non residents. Government
external borrowing, mostly on concessional terms, was also significant in 2010, at about
US$2.8 billion. Further supported by oil exports in 2011, gross international reserves at the
Bank of Ghana reached US$4.7 billion in December 2010 (3.0 months of imports) and are
projected at US$5.4 billion (3.1 months of imports) by end 2011, up from US$2.0 billion
(2.2 months of imports) by end 2008. By mid-2011, exports receipts, (including oil), were
US$2.5 billion higher than that of the same period in 2010 (including US$1.2 billion worth
of crude oil exports), allowing imports to increase by almost the same amount without
negatively affecting the current account balance. From 8.2 percent of GDP in 2010, the
current account deficit is projected to amount to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2011.

                    B.      MACRO-ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND
                              DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

15.     Ghana is on track to meet its immediate macroeconomic targets: reduced fiscal
imbalances (a positive basic primary balance from 2011), increased foreign currency
reserves, reduced stock of arrears, and contained price inflation to single digit levels.
The IMF Article IV and ECF third and fourth reviews from May 2011 consider Ghana‟s
external and growth prospects as favorable, driven by high export prices and oil production,
assuming that fiscal vulnerabilities are addressed through structural reforms. Indeed, unless
public expenditure arrears are regularized, this would pose risks to corporate liquidity and
banks. Besides, persistent large public financing needs could fuel inflation and currency
instability. The fifth ECF review, covering the period from January to June 2011 and the
preparation of the Budget 2012, took place in October 2011, with an IMF Board discussion
on December 14, 2011 (see Annex 4).

16.      Not being greatly exposed to international financial markets (on both assets
and liabilities sides), Ghana’s financial sector was able to withstand the global
financial crisis of 2008 and is likely to withstand as well the current one originating
from the United States and the Euro zone. On some grounds, Ghana could actually
benefit from global financial turbulences, through their impact on gold prices. But weak
risk management, accounting, competition and governance practices, and the dominance of
the state-owned banks need to be addressed to achieve long term financial viability.
Strengthening Bank of Ghana supervision capacity and resolution powers, credit
enforcement, and competition in the financial sector is also required to improve access to
credit, to small and medium enterprises in particular.

17.     While expenditure controls are being strengthened, most of the fiscal
adjustment from 2011 will be stemming from improved revenue collection. Since 2009,
major efforts were undertaken by the Government to reinforce expenditure controls, the
lack thereof being at the origin of the widening of public deficits up to 2008. While
significant progress was made since 2009 to address these issues, thus reducing the
likelihood of further expenditure slippage in the near future, the upward revision in GDP
also led authorities to realize Ghana‟s poor domestic revenue collection, at 14.4 percent of
GDP in 2010, that is much below the average of the group of lower middle income
countries than Ghana just joined. Thus, by November 2011, revenue (excluding grants) was
projected to rise sharply in 2011 (18.1 percent of GDP) and beyond (18.7 percent in 2013),
as oil and non oil revenue should grow significantly compared with 2010. In 2011,
authorities project an oil revenue equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP. As far as non-oil
revenue is concerned, authorities bank on broadening the tax base (communication service
tax, VAT for financial services), on improving tax administration (in ports notably, where
revenue rose by 40 percent in Q1 2011 as compliance was strengthened after public reports
of large abuse, and in the mining sector), and streamlining exemptions. Figures up to
September 2011 were consistent with the planned fiscal consolidation.

18.     The Government fiscal strategy also foresees the clearance of remaining
arrears in 2011 and 2012. Given their impact on firms‟ liquidity and ability to operate,
financial sector‟s assets quality, and public investment project completion, the Government
sees arrears regularization vis-à-vis private contractors, SOEs and Statutory Funds as a key
pillar of its fiscal consolidation strategy. The strategy includes a combination of cash

                                             10
payments and bond issuance, accounting for Government‟s cash flow and the inflationary
impact of cash injection in the economy. The Government planned to regularize GH¢2,350
million worth of arrears (4.0 percent of GDP) in 2011, and another GH¢101 million in 2012
to leave a stock of arrears to contractors, and SOEs at GH¢1,349 million (2.0 percent of
GDP) by end-2012.

19.     In 2012, the Government intends to develop a large public investment plan. Per
the Budget Statement for the Financial Year 2012 approved by Parliament on December 6,
2011, the public investment plan is to be mostly financed externally. The public investment
plan foresees notably the rapid completion of the gas infrastructure, with a view to augment
oil production capacity and lower electricity generation costs.

20.     The Government strategy is not immune from risks, as mounting political
pressures for fiscal expansion and public sector wage increases could significantly
undermine Government fiscal consolidation plans. Risks lie in particular in
Government‟s ability to negotiate with unions a within-budget public wage increase and a
gradual implementation of the “single spine? reform,4,5 succeed in significantly raising
taxes, and contain domestically financed capital expenditures. The onset of oil production,
the announcement of higher financial resources through greater South-South cooperation,
and the higher statistical GDP have indeed, without doubt, led to high expectations among
population that Ghana has now joined a group of oil rich countries and that this will provide
a large part of what is needed – improved service delivery and infrastructure. This in a
broader context of very competitive politics and a repeated history of macroeconomic
slippages ahead of general elections, the next one being scheduled for end-2012.
Furthermore, a continued deterioration of the global economic environment -- worsening
terms of trade, declining remittances and official development assistance from OECD
countries, would inevitably amplify the impact of potential fiscal slippages on
macroeconomic stability.

21.      However, risks of macroeconomic instability ahead of elections are probably
lower today than in 2008. Beyond Government‟s commitment to protect macroeconomic
stability in 2012, as clearly stated in the Budget Statement 2012, a number of factors could
mitigate such risks. Firstly, the initial macroeconomic conditions are much better today than
they were in early 2008: high economic growth, substantial foreign reserves, low public
financing needs, and stable inflation expectations from the population. Secondly, control
systems are now in place to prevent uncontrolled fiscal slippages: commitment controls,
automatic cost-recovery mechanisms, a centralized wage negotiation system, the petroleum

  In August 2011, The Government and Organized Labor agreed on a 20 percent increase in base pay and on
the Single Spine Salary Structure (SSSS) and on a 1.7 percentage point relativity. Given the policy of
automatic promotion, this means that nominal individual remunerations of public servants, excluding other
promotion and allowances, will go up by 22 percent in 2011 compared with 2010. Besides, the SSSS is
effective for all public sector employees since January 1, 2010. Hence, retroactive payments shall be honored
for those transferred to the SSSS after this date and the Government plans to do so between 2011 (0.5 percent
of GDP) and 2012 (1.4 percent of GDP), under the assumption that all public sector employees will have been
migrated to the SSSS by end-2011.

price hedging mechanism and the Petroleum stabilization fund.6 Third, there is possibly
increasing awareness in Ghana of the costs of large political business cycles. Gaining from
the experience of democratic transitions in power, political parties now factor in the fact
that no election will be their last, encouraging them to take a longer term view. The private
sector is also emerging as a key swing voter against parties willing to sacrifice the nation‟s
investment climate for reelection. Finally, organized groups of citizens are increasingly
demanding accountability from government – as reflected in civil society advocacy for
responsible petroleum revenue management or independent budget analysis among many
other examples.

22.      Besides, the arrival of oil brings additional challenges to the quality of growth
and its pro-poor nature. Oil, through its impact on Government revenue, will almost
inevitably boost growth in the next years through demand effects. But it will also
exacerbate a number of already existing challenges related to governance (in oil and gas
sectors, and more broadly in the management of public resources), volatility (prices, oil
reserves uncertainty), agricultural competitiveness and geographical disparities (North-
South notably). Ghana‟s ability to address these challenges will have a major influence on
longer term growth and poverty alleviation. The World Bank report on the economy-wide
impact of oil discovery prepared in 2009 suggests that, in absence of fiscal consolidation,
increased transparency, removed bottlenecks in non tradable sectors, stabilization
mechanisms and increased provision of agricultural public goods, economic growth could,
after the initial boom, be lower over the long run than without oil. In that event, poverty
would suffer from lower economic growth and increased regional disparities, in disfavor of
the North. On the face of it, Ghana has made significant progress in setting up the
institutional and regulatory framework for oil and gas. It is also committed to promoting
commercial agriculture, and has established and funded the Savannah Accelerated
Development Authority.

23.     The implementation of the Government’s economic stabilization and reform
program should minimize risks of external debt distress. A Joint Bank-Fund Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) was conducted in May 20117, using new national accounts,
thus revised lower debt to GDP ratios and sooner prospects for IDA graduation than
previously assumed with higher GNI per capita. Accordingly, Ghana‟s debt burden
indicators have improved since the June 2010 assessment, and the lower than anticipated
level of non concessional borrowing in 2010, also contributed to it. Risk of external debt
distress is assessed to remain at a moderate level, provided that the programmed fiscal
consolidation is achieved and external public sector borrowing is restrained. At the same
time, overall public sector debt is projected to increase moderately in relation to GDP over
the long term. If the planned fiscal consolidation is achieved without a substantial further
debt build-up (including through contingent liabilities from SOEs debt, currently not
included in public debt numbers) an improved rating of low risk of debt distress could be
considered in a future assessment.

24.    Debt sustainability is also predicated on prudent non concessional borrowing.

additional electricity capacity and road networks), Ghana borrowed externally at non
concessional terms US$458 million equivalent in 2008, US$448 million equivalent in 2009,
and US$215 million equivalent in 2010 to finance projects for rural electrification,
electricity transmission and generation capacity, housing, health, security, transport, fire-
fighting, sea coast protection, as well as to cover an unfunded external SOE liability in
2009. In its third and fourth reviews of the Extended Credit Facility (covering the period
January 1- December 31, 2010), the IMF indicated that the ceiling on non-concessional
borrowing had been respected over the relevant period. Accordingly, disincentives applied
to the country since 2008 were discontinued, consistent with a progressive path towards
market financing, and Ghana will receive its full IDA allocation on regular terms in FY12
(and part of its IDA allocation in the form of grants). If Ghana‟s GNI per capita (atlas
method) stays over the IDA operational cutoff in 2011 and 2012, it will eventually receive
its allocation in blend terms from FY14.8 In its assessment of Ghana‟s non concessional
borrowing in 2010,9 the World Bank also acknowledges progress made to (i) restore the
operational and financial sustainability of state-owned energy utilities to limit default risks
on their non-concessional debt, (ii) develop a Medium Term Debt Management Strategy,10
and (iii) strengthen Ghana‟s capacity to select and appraise public investment projects11.

25.     The Parliament approved in August 2011 a Master Facility Agreement to
borrow US$3.0 billion from the China Development Bank at non concessional terms.
The MFA has been signed by MOFEP to be considered under the Non Concessional
Borrowing Policy. Subsidiary loan agreements for nine of the twelve individual investment
projects12 have been approved by Parliament. As part of its fifth ECF review, the IMF, in
collaboration with the World Bank, has reviewed the Agreement, its appropriateness to the
macroeconomic framework, as well as its impact on debt sustainability. The review
concluded overall that the preliminary selection of projects to be financed under the
Agreement was in line with GSGDA‟s objectives, and justified in particular by the very
high returns expected from the gas project. In line with the joint DSA of May 2011 (which
included US$4.2 billion worth of non concessional borrowing to be disbursed over the

   Starting in IDA16, IDA‟s hardened term credits (for countries with a GNI per capita exceeding the
operational cutoff for three consecutive years) and blend countries will be harmonized into one instrument
with a final maturity of 25 years with a 5-year grace period and a 1.25 percent per annum interest rate.

   A new debt management strategy was adopted in 2010 and published by MOFEP, drawing on joint Bank-
Fund technical assistance. The strategy establishes clear objectives for debt management in terms of the cost
and risk of the debt portfolio (including contingent liabilities such as non guaranteed debt contracted by public
entities), and identifies potential funding sources. With the anticipated decline in potential for concessional
borrowing, the strategy recommends to fill the financing gap with semi-concessional and commercial debt,
while extending the maturities of domestic debt (to 10 years). To minimize the currency risk on debt
portfolio, government intends to maintain a balanced currency split even though most of the current debt,
reserves and export receipts are US dollar denominated. It is also planning to apply a second Debt
Management Performance Assessment to monitor progress in institutional strengthening and to further
identify areas in need of further reform. In addition, it will publish quarterly debt bulletins, focusing on debt
sustainability issues.
11
   In 2010, the Government adopted the Public Private Partnership (PPP) policy, to be converted into a Bill for
submission to Parliament. The policy defines guidelines, procedure and institutional responsibilities for the
appraisal and selection of public investment projects, be it financed directly through the budget, through
concessional or non concessional borrowing, or through PPP arrangements.
12
   Projects include the development of railways, gas infrastructure, and industrial zones in the Western region,
commercial agriculture in Accra plains, railways in the Eastern region, fishing infrastructure in coastal areas,
urban transport in Accra, and nation-wide SME incubation.

period 2011-16), the updated joint DSA also conservatively concluded that Ghana could
borrow US$3.0 billion at non concessional terms in the next 4 years (US$750 million each
year) without increasing risks of external debt distress.13 Moving forward, MOFEP
committed to review, with World Bank technical assistance, the institutional framework
currently directing public investment decision – from strategic guidance and formal
appraisal, to project selection, budgeting, implementation and evaluation – in order to
maximize economic and social returns of projects and their integration into medium term
budget frameworks.

26.     Ghana’s macro-economic framework is assessed as adequate for the purpose of
the proposed operation. The fiscal stabilization objectives set forth in the 2011 and 2012
Budget and execution so far (as evidenced by the successful conclusion of the IMF ECF
fifth review on December 14, 2011, see Annex 4), the nature and pace of actions taken by
the Government since 2009 to regain control of the fiscal situation on a sustainable basis
and the complementary financial assistance from DPs and the IMF should provide the
conditions for the proposed operation to meet its objectives, and justify the use of IDA
resources.

       C.       POVERTY TRENDS AND PROGRESS IN SOCIAL AND HUMAN
                              DEVELOPMENT

27.     Ghana recorded very significant poverty reduction between 1992 and 2006,
though almost entirely concentrated in the South. The estimated proportion of the poor
in the total population went down from 51.7 percent in 1992 to 28.5 percent in 2006.14 And
this trend was accompanied by a strong decline in the prevalence of malnutrition, which
was halved between 1993 and 2008. But most of the poverty reduction occurred in the
South, where large productivity gains in the agricultural sector (cocoa in particular) and
demographic changes freed human and financial resources to be redeployed and invested in
higher value-added sectors, the urban informal sector in particular. The bulk of poverty has
become concentrated in the three northern regions comprising a quarter of the country‟s
population, and more than half of the country‟s poor. No significant poverty reduction has
been observed in the past (latest observation in 2006), either through local development or
out-migration15, although recent agricultural production and productivity data suggest
accelerated agriculture development in the northern regions.

28.     Participatory and quantitative assessments describe a situation where the poor
in Northern Ghana are predominantly rainfall-dependent farmers. These farmers are
highly vulnerable to shocks given the limited diversification of their income sources. While
the poor have little education, increases in education in Northern Ghana do not seem to
have provided greater livelihood opportunities. This is reflective of the absence of better
off-farm opportunities in these regions. To cope with the various shocks to which they are
exposed (floods, droughts, insects, diseases, conflicts – all of which are preventable with
relevant infrastructure, public services, insurance and conflict resolution mechanisms) the
poor tend to mortgage their prospects to eventually escape poverty by depleting their

   Poverty rates are computed using the national poverty line. Estimates using the international poverty line of
US$1.25 a day put the poverty rate at 30 percent in 2006, down from 39 percent in 1999.

29.    Efforts to address the special needs of these lagging regions had been initiated
in the recent past, most notably with the establishment of the Savannah Accelerated
Development Authority (SADA), which aims to increase agricultural productivity, promote
a more sustainable management of its natural resources and reduce the exposure of the
population to collective risks, such as natural disasters. This initiative will ensure tight
coordination and better targeting of public and private (e.g. NGOs) activities, in order to
achieve durable poverty alleviation. In this respect, effective decentralization of resource
and decision making is foreseen as an important means to address regional imbalances in
service delivery, via the strengthening of local capacity and vertical accountability
mechanisms.

30.     Since 2006, various factors could have impacted poverty positively or
negatively. Between 2006 and 2010, per capita real private consumption grew by
approximately 13 percent, which, if equally shared across households, should have
generated significant poverty reduction gains (if unchanged distribution is assumed, the
headcount index would have approached 24.8 percent by end-2010). However, important
uncertainties regarding the measurement of private consumption and its distribution among
households and regions, and the fact that some recent shocks (e.g., climatic events, price
variations) might have disproportionally affected the poor could mean lower actual poverty
reduction gains. A new Ghana Living Standard Survey (GLSS6) is scheduled to be
conducted in 2011/12, providing the necessary data for a poverty update. Combined with
revised national accounts for the period 2006-10, it could also modify our understanding of
the role played by economic growth, and its various sectors, in poverty reduction in the last
two decades. So far, the assessment was that Ghana‟s economic growth had been very
much “pro-poor? between 1992 and 2006, at least from a cross-country perspective. Indeed,

                                                15
Ghana stands as one of the countries that have experienced the largest growth contribution
and the lowest inequality contribution to poverty reduction.

31.     The high vulnerability of poor households to frequent shocks underlines the
importance of protecting them through targeted measures, such as a further extension
of the cash transfer program (Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty, LEAP) to new
beneficiaries. The recent review of existing social protection mechanisms indeed suggests
that LEAP offers the greatest guarantee of reaching the poor as relatively well targeted,16
even if implementation costs remain high and could be reduced as the program expands.

32.      The ongoing fiscal stabilization efforts also call for protection and improved
effectiveness and efficiency of pro-poor expenditures. In spite of large cuts in public
spending, the poor were protected in 2010, and it will be important to continue protecting
them in the future. But effectiveness and efficiency gains can be made in numerous sectors
as well. The recently completed Public Expenditure Review underlines in this respect the
criticality of containing general increases in personal emoluments to lower unit costs of
service delivery (in Health, Education and Agriculture networks in particular) while
providing the space for financing non-wage expenditure, and encourage effective
deployment of staff and supervisors to poor areas. It also underlines the criticality of PFM
reforms, cash management in particular, to accelerate releases to beneficiaries.

33.      Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is being made,
except in sanitation and health. Income/poverty, hunger, primary education completion,
gender parity at school and access to water goals (MDG1a, MDG1b, MDG2, MDG3 and
MDG7a respectively) are on track to be met by 2015, if not already met (MDG7a).17 These
services have been extended to millions of poor in the past decade, and protecting the gains
of the past must be a key priority for the coming years. At the same time, other important
MDGs, such as sanitation (MDG7b), child (MDG4) and maternal mortality (MDG5) are
still off-track and require more effort, for their own sake and likely large impact on other
MDGs.18




16
   See Republic of Ghana: Improving the Targeting of Social Programs, World Bank, June 2010, Washington
D.C. The report suggests that with 57 percent of its beneficiaries below the poverty line, LEAP has the highest
targeting efficiency among Ghana‟s social programs and subsidies.
17
   When at least two observations are available after 1990, with a sufficient number of years separating them,
the World Bank determines whether a country is on or off track to meet a given MDG by 2015. To do so, it
compares the progress recorded so far with that needed to reach the MDG, under the assumption that progress
becomes increasingly difficult the closer countries get to the goal. Technically, this is equivalent to comparing
the annual growth rate between 1990 and today with the constant growth rate required to reach the MDG in
2015 from the situation in 1990.

     D.        THE GHANA SHARED GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

34.    The Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA, 2010-13)
follows GPRS-I and GPRS-II. 19 With an upwards revision of the national accounts in
2010, the GSGDA lays the foundation for the rapid structural transformation of the
economy, premised on agricultural modernization and a sustainable exploitation of mineral
resources. Building on lessons learned from GPRS-I and GPRS-II, the GSGDA emphasizes
the need for continued macroeconomic stability and greater executive efficiency,
transparency and accountability to provide the setting for poverty reduction. It also
underlines the pivotal role of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for effective implementation of the GSGDA.

35.     The GSGDA and the Aid Policy Paper for the period 2011-1520 reiterate the
need for continued official development assistance – and budget support in particular.
Indeed, financing needs to meet Ghana‟s development aspirations cannot be entirely funded
from domestic resources combined with prudent external non concessional borrowing. And
while forthcoming oil revenue could eventually prompt DPs to reduce their Overseas
Development Assistance (ODA) to Ghana, it is the Government‟s view that continued
support would be needed in the first years of oil production to limit the potential of the “oil
curse? developing in Ghana. Indeed, risks of political capture, macroeconomic instability,
lost external competitiveness and increased regional inequalities stemming from oil are
significant21, and call for particular attention to public sector reform (single spine pay
reform, decentralization, capacity building, transparency and external accountability), the
enforcement of multi-year macroeconomic frameworks (public financial management, debt
management strategy, medium term expenditure frameworks, tax collection), macro-

19
   The GSGDA comprises three volumes: the policy framework, the costing framework, and the monitoring
and evaluation framework. The policy framework benefited from consultations in 2009-10 with Ministries,
Departments and Agencies (MDAs), private sector representatives, civil society organizations, chieftaincies,
and was discussed with Development Partners (DPs) at the Consultative Group Meeting held in September
2010. The “Coordinated Program of Economic and Social Development Policies, 2010-16?, which forms the
basis of the GSGDA, was presented by the President of the Republic of Ghana to the Parliament on December
2010.

economic stabilization (utilities financial recovery, oil stabilization funds, arrears
liquidation, financial sector regulation), the investment climate (urban development, land
regulation, informal labor markets), and rural development (commercial agriculture,
connective infrastructure and social protection in the north, climate change adaptation and
mitigation). Against this background, continued ODA could be particularly instrumental to
secure stable funding, encourage the development of macroeconomic stabilization
mechanisms, continued progress in public financial management, transparency, executive
accountability, capacity building, investment effectiveness, and overall reform
implementation. In this context, general budget support would continue to be the preferred
aid modality, within the aligned and harmonized MDBS framework.

36.      The Joint Staff Assessment Note22 found the underlying sector development
plans compelling and well considered, but also stressed important risks to
implementation, which could reduce Ghana’s ability to meet the GSGDA objectives.
These reflect limited monitoring and evaluation capacity, insufficient reliance on spatial
interventions, and a large resource gap, which the Government estimated at US$12.5
billion. In these respects, consideration should be given to (i) limiting the number of
GSGDA indicators to monitor while improving fiscal reporting, (ii) accelerating the use of
geographically targeted interventions and the development of related coordinating
institutions, and (iii) strengthening the capacity of the MTEF to allocate public resource to
GSGDA priorities. Furthermore, efforts to accelerate disbursements on donor-funded
projects, encourage public-private partnerships, strengthen tax collection and the revenue
base and public finance management, while improving the effectiveness of public spending,
will help increase Ghana‟s fiscal space.

       E.      RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR

37.     Commercializing and modernizing agriculture is imperative with the advent of
oil and the risks of a loss of competitiveness associated with real exchange rate
appreciation and potential “Dutch Disease? effects.23 A loss of global agricultural
competitiveness has been observed in other countries that supposedly benefited from the oil
booms of the 1970s and 1980s such as Nigeria, Ecuador, Mexico, Algeria, Iran and Iraq.
These experiences underline the special challenge confronting Ghana in managing the
emerging oil economy. At the same time, Ghana„s oil economy presents an unparalleled
opportunity for the agricultural sector and for poverty reduction in particular. Demand for
food, especially higher valued products, such as horticulture and livestock products, will
increase as incomes rise. Urbanization and associated shift in consumer preferences will
increase demand for processed foods with greater domestic value-added. Provided Ghana„s
tradable sectors can remain competitive, this provides an opportunity for both farming and
the food processing manufacturing sector. Well managed oil revenues can fund
complementary public investment and reverse chronic under-investment in public goods
that has constrained agricultural growth.

38.    Agricultural GDP grew by over 6 percent per annum during the past three
years (2008 – 2010). Until recently, agricultural growth had been driven primarily by area
expansion rather than productivity gains. However, a steadily increasing use of agricultural

inputs has started to contribute to yield increases that are partly accountable for substantial
production increases in recent years. Consistent with the structural transformation process
experienced in other agrarian economies, non-agricultural sectors have grown more rapidly
than the agriculture sector, with the result that the share of agriculture in overall economic
activity declined. The recent revision to Ghana‟s national accounts has resulted in
agriculture now accounting for 30 percent of GDP (from 39 percent under the old measure).

39.      With the decline in commodity prices from their peaks of 2008 – 09, agriculture
GDP declined from 7.6 percent in 2009 to a more moderate 5.2 percent in 2011. The
rise in public spending – which affects value addition and productivity, rather than prices –
was insufficient to off-set the fall in prices. Moreover, one can expect a lag between the
activities funded by public expenditures and their manifestation in economy-wide value
added. The global financial crisis may have affected private sector investments in
agriculture with subsequent downward pressure on the agriculture GDP growth rate.

40.     Ghana has become more food secure at the national level. At the national level,
agricultural production has increased substantially during the period 2007-2010, especially
for food grains. Most notably, based on the available statistics from MoFA (see Table 5),
maize production increased from 1.22 million to 1.87 million tonnes, and rice from 185,000
tonnes to 295,000 tonnes, attributable to area expansion (close to 10 percent for maize,
approximately 30 percent for rice from 2007-2010) and yield increases. Rice imports
remain significant (approximately 400,000 tonnes in 2010), although the ongoing expansion
in domestic rice production is increasingly resulting in import substitution.

41.     Agriculture sector growth can be partly attributed to productivity gains from
more intensive farming practices and technology adoption. A gradual shift is occurring
from highly variable low input-low output farming to high input-high output market
oriented agriculture and agri-business. Most significantly, in collaboration with the private
sector, the fertilizer subsidy program that was launched in 2008 has contributed to a
doubling of the fertilizer market, from approximately 50,000 tonnes of fertilizer in 2007
and 2008 to 130,000 tonnes in 2010 (of which 95,000 tonnes under the subsidy program)
and approximately 170,000 tonnes in 2011 (as a preliminary estimate, 150,000 tonnes was
included under the subsidy program). These rough estimates exclude fertilizer for the cocoa
sector.24 As supported under the AgDPO series, the fertilizer subsidy program for food

24
   Based on rough industry estimates by two of Ghana‟s fertilizer importers and distributors, Yara and Golden
Stork. These estimates do not include fertilizer used in the cocoa sector, which are estimated at 50,000 tonnes
in 2008 and 100,000 tonnes in 2011.

                                                      19
grains has focused on the introduction of modern fertilizer technology, providing a subsidy
to the target group of commercially viable smallholder farmers (not including cocoa
farmers) to enable them to use and adopt the products, increasing their productivity and
profitability which eventually enables them to purchase fertilizer at full cost. Recently
conducted qualitative analysis has confirmed that the number of fertilizer users has
increased during the same period, as have application rates (IFPRI, 2011). According to
MoFA survey data, the widespread adoption of fertilizer has resulted in substantial yield
increases between 2007 and 2010 for maize (23 percent) and rice (59 percent). Yield
increases for sorghum (73 percent), cassava (21 percent), and yams (14 percent) have been
achieved, resulting from the adoption of improved varieties that have been developed
during recent years.

42.     Agricultural production and productivity are increasing in the three northern
regions where Ghana’s food insecurity has been most pervasive. Agricultural
production increases in Northern, Upper West, and Upper East regions were higher than in
the rest of the country, suggesting that government efforts to address constraints in these
regions through some of its programs are yielding results. During the period 2007-2010, the
share of maize production in Northern, Upper West and Upper East regions increased from
11 percent to 19 percent of national production, and the share of rice production increased
from 49 percent to 67 percent of national production. In addition, current efforts to revive
the cotton sector in the three northern regions may result in increased incomes for many
thousands of smallholder farmers. Three cotton companies have started their operations this
year, and Government is planning a new institutional and regulatory framework. The Bank
is providing technical assistance in support of this process, focusing on (i) the institutional
and regulatory framework, (ii) cotton pricing, and (iii) supporting Farmer Based
Organizations.

43.    Following the significant uptake of fertilizer technology, a more comprehensive
approach to fertilizer and seed technology development and adoption is under
preparation. MoFA estimates that less than 20 percent of area under cultivation is planted
using certified seed. To achieve significant productivity gains, the implementation of the
new seed legislation will encourage technology innovation and private sector investment in
the seed industry, as supported under the current AgDPO series. With a focus on the
synergies between seed and fertilizer in subsequent subsidy programs as supported under
the AgDPO, the aim is to develop efficient input markets where seed, fertilizer and
agrochemicals are offered to farmers as a package rather than being sold in isolation

                                                20
through fragmented distribution networks, as is currently the case. In contrast to many other
African countries, there is a substantial, though fragmented, private sector presence in
agricultural input retail and distribution markets. Over 3,000 agro-dealers exist, scattered
throughout the country.

44.      Climate change is projected to have significant impacts on Ghana, and risk
management strategies are needed. Policy priorities related to seed and fertilizer
technology and irrigation reflect the fact that the northern and southern Savannah zones are
expected to become more vulnerable to drought and occasional floods as the effects of
climate change manifest themselves in Ghana. Drought tolerant and short-maturing
varieties for key crops are being developed by the Savannah Agricultural Research Institute
(SARI). Likewise, planned developments in the irrigation sector focus on improved
irrigation, water management and flood control, as recommended, including inland valley
development for rice production by which water use is maximized through water
harvesting.25 To mitigate against climate-related risks, Ghana‟s insurance industry has
developed rainfall index-based insurance products suitable for farmers and credit providers,
and rolled out close to 2,000 policies to individual farmers during 2011, assisted by GIZ.

45.     Government has made progress in strengthening the role and functioning of
farmer-based organizations (FBOs) with an emphasis on women beneficiaries, both
through capacity building and actively facilitating FBOs to be included in commercial out-
grower and contract-farming enterprises. Between 2007 and 2010, the number of
functioning FBOs increased by 47 percent, the number of FBOs accessing financial
services increased by 125 percent, and the number of FBOs accessing marketing
information increased by 168 percent (MoFA 2011). Since 2008, a total of 1,480 farmers
from 296 FBOs have been trained on enterprise development as part of capacity building of
FBOs in Ghana under the Agricultural Services Program (supported by CIDA). Women
farmers formed 40 percent of beneficiaries of the capacity building effort. As a result of the
registration exercise of FBOs in the country, over 5,000 farmer-based organizations were
validated for inclusion in the national database. The FBO policy framework that will serve
as a guide for the development and operation of FBOs at all levels along the agricultural
value chain in Ghana has been developed in close consultation with stakeholders.

46.    To support the integration of smallholder farmers into commercial value
chains, the Government has developed a Commercial Agriculture Program. The
program includes the World Bank and USAID co-financed Ghana Commercial Agriculture
Project (GCAP), aimed at building farmers‟ ability to engage in business ventures with
commercial firms, and facilitating commercial firms in engaging with rural communities to
form out-grower schemes and establish an integrated business model. The program includes
a dedicated investment promotion and facilitation effort, and will promote the provision of
financing for investments in agriculture.

47.    The development of structured trading mechanisms, such as warehouse receipt
systems and forward markets, continues to be supported by Government and DPs.
New legislation in support of a warehouse receipt system and a commodities exchange is
under preparation and a warehouse receipt system pilot has been launched. While a number

of development programs plan to build or rehabilitate warehouses, the availability of
physical warehousing infrastructure in the immediate term remains a constraint.

48.     Agricultural lending has increased in recent years, despite the effects of the
global financial crisis. The share of the banking sector‟s lending portfolio for agriculture
was 7.27 percent in 2010, compared to 6.30 percent in 2007.26 In absolute terms, private
sector lending excluding agriculture increased by 102 percent between 2007 and 2010,
while lending to agriculture private sector increased by 135 percent (Bank of Ghana, 2011),
reflecting commercial banks‟ increasing interest in the agricultural sector as lending
market.27 As supported under the AgDPO, this trend is expected to continue as commercial
agricultural lending instruments are being introduced, particularly addressing the medium
to long term financing needs of agribusinesses.

49.      The value of nontraditional agricultural exports (in Ghana Cedis) increased by
28 percent during the period 2007 – 2010. While the Ghana Cedi depreciated, the export
value expressed in US Dollars declined by 16 percent.28 However, despite the economic
downturn in Ghana‟s export markets, total export volumes declined only slightly by 5
percent. This overall result indicates that Ghana has been able to retain its competitiveness
in a difficult global environment.

50.     A new irrigation sector investment framework is under preparation, aimed at
enhancing efficiency of existing irrigation infrastructure and encouraging new private
investments. The investment framework will identify an operational pipeline of investment
projects, including investment preparedness criteria and modalities, as a direct input into
METASIP and recommend institutional reforms. The development of this approach has
been supported under the CAADP framework, and Ghana will be the first country in Africa
to develop and implement it.

51.    The Ghana Fisheries Program (P124775) has recently been approved by
Parliament. Fleet rationalization through licensing and enforcement of fisheries regulations
can bring about substantial productivity gains, conserving fish stocks and providing
economic benefits to a more productive small-scale marine fisheries sector. Aquaculture on
Lake Volta and other water bodies is increasingly providing opportunities for commercial
and small-scale fish production.

52.     Coordination of the sector-wide resource allocation and budget management
process that meets the needs of METASIP is improving. Government is in the process of
developing a new program-based budgeting process, by which the GSGDA objectives and
METASIP program areas and activities are linked, and used to identify agriculture
expenditure for each MDA. This is currently in a trial phase that will produce a program-
based, METASIP-compatible budget for 2012 (in parallel with the current budget format).
It is scheduled for full implementation during preparation of the 2013 budget. Once in


26
   Using the most recent data from the Bank of Ghana, this includes lending to the cocoa marketing board
(COCOBOD) for cocoa marketing.
27
   In addition, agriculture lending among rural community banks, not captured under the above Bank of
Ghana‟s statistic, has expanded by 26% during the period under review.
28
   Using the latest available date from the Ghana Export Promotion Council, the 2007 baseline value of
nontraditional agricultural exports has changed from Ȼ 180.2 m (US$ 169.2 m) to Ȼ 185.2 m (US$ 197.2 m).

                                                   22
place, this will become an important management tool for the METASIP Steering
Committee, and for DPs and other stakeholders who are supporting METASIP.


               III.     GHANA’S AGRICULTURE SECTOR PROGRAM AND
                                PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

53.     Ghana has developed an agriculture sector policy, an investment framework,
and has internalized the CAADP agenda29. Following a sector-wide consultation process
on the content of METASIP, the Ghana CAADP Compact was signed in October 2009 by
Government, DPs, private sector and civil society, thereby committing stakeholders to
collective and individual efforts to support agricultural development. Importantly, CAADP
has provided an enhanced framework for scaling up resources to agriculture – in line with
G20 commitments at l'Aguila and Pittsburgh – and for improved harmonization and
alignment. METASIP spans the period 2011 – 2015 and incorporates relevant programs of
agriculture-related ministries and agencies. It also anticipates activities of the private sector
and civil society. Key stakeholders include MoFA; Ministry of Trade and Industry;
Ministry of Roads and Highways; Ministry of Local Government; Ministry of Lands and
Natural Resources; Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology; other relevant
Government bodies; DPs; NGOs; academia; civil society; farmers and other on-farm and
off-farm private sector operators; and service providers. Consultations resulted in the
setting of investment priorities in the agriculture sector and the development of METASIP.
The organizing structure of the investment plan corresponds with the existing sector policy
(FASDEP II) with programs clustered under six themes. Box 1 provides a summary of key
investment priorities.

54.      METASIP reflects Ghana’s agricultural policy and planning environment.
First, it brings on board sector stakeholders in effective coordination and participation.
Second, it continues to reaffirm the Government‟s commitment to spend at least 10 percent
of the national budget on agriculture, consistent with the 2003 Maputo Declaration.30 Third,
by adopting a sector perspective, it seeks to improve coordination across MDAs. Fourth, it
presents the foundation for a substantial scale-up of public resources to the sector –
including additional development assistance.

55.    Continued stakeholder dialogue has guided the development of programs for
the implementation of METASIP, including this programmatic DPO series. The
Agriculture Sector Working Group and the METASIP Implementation Steering Committee
represent GoG, DPs, farmers, private sector, civil society and meet at regular intervals. The
annual Joint Sector Review is an inclusive sector review and stakeholder consultation
process that feeds into the annual planning and budget processes by GoG, and allows for
coordination among stakeholders.


29
   CAADP is organized along the following four pillars: (i) Extending the area under sustainable land
management and reliable water control systems; (ii) Improving rural infrastructure and trade-related capacities
for market access; (iii) Increasing food supply and reducing hunger; and (iv) Agricultural research, technology
dissemination and adoption.
30
   The Maputo Declaration, made by African leaders in the context of the AU Summit in 2003, calls for 10
percent of national budgets to be allocated to agriculture sector with the aim of achieving 6 percent annual
growth and 5 percent annual labor productivity growth in the sector.

                                                      23
56.     The METASIP Implementation Steering Committee is operational. It has been
meeting at monthly intervals since its launch in early 2011 and has made progress in
developing an overall METASIP implementation structure that includes the launch of the
Strategic Agricultural Knowledge Support System (SAKSS), the development of a work
plan for the Committee and a program of work for METASIP, and the establishment of a
coordination function with CAADP support institutions (notably with NEPAD).

57.     The incremental investment plan, in addition to existing resources, is costed at
over US$1 billion over five years. To illustrate the cross-sectoral nature, US$285.7 million
is allocated for upgrading rural roads, to be implemented by the Ministry of Roads and
Highways. Likely sources of funds and the commitment to investment plan are shown in
Table 6. The estimated funding gap for the investment program is estimated at US$702.2
million over five years.

                    Table 6. Proposed METASIP Funding (US$ million)

58.     Government is increasingly meeting its commitment to scale up resources to
the sector. The MoFA budget for 2012 shows a 42 percent increase of Government
resources allocated to the sector and includes a Priority Intervention Program allocation
under the Annual Budget Funding Amount that allocates revenues from the oil and gas
sector in accordance with the Petroleum Revenue Management Act of 2011. The overall
resource availability is 18 percent higher than in 2011. While execution of the MoFA
budget over budget allocations is nearly 100 percent, quarterly disbursements of funds are
not always on schedule. More importantly, MoFA‟s budget submissions to MoFEP are
never fully funded. The new program-based budgeting system and the AgPER work will
strengthen the budgeting process by identifying priorities based on programs and program
performance in the sector, across the various ministries that contribute to agriculture sector
development.

59.     However, the METASIP funding gap remains substantial and will require
continued commitment from DPs, GoG, and private sector. Donor funding appears to
have declined during 2011 and 2012, although this masks substantial investments by
USAID and the Bank (Feed the Future and the Commercial Agriculture Project
respectively) which represent a delayed response by DPs to key components in the
METASIP. With the inauguration of the METASIP Steering Committee, combined with the
new Government-wide program-based budget process that will come on stream in 2013, a
coordinated resource mobilization effort should be supported by program performance
monitoring and evidence-based policy making and guide the programming of donor

                                             24
support. Further planning and monitoring of funding commitments is required in order to
identify funding priorities and make program adjustments if and when certain program
components are underfunded. The inclusion of private investment in the METASIP review
and planning process is essential, and can be facilitated by the Commercial Agriculture
Project implementation team that includes GIPC, the PPP Unit at MoFEP, and MoFA. It is
proposed that technical assistance be provided by the Bank, possibly in collaboration with
other DPs, aimed at validating METASIP‟s funding performance, future funding needs, and
mapping funding sources from GoG, DPs, and the private sector.

                                      Box 1: The Programs of METASIP
Program 1: Food Security and Emergency Preparedness has seven components: (i) Productivity
Improvement, mainly of staple crops (maize, cassava, rice, yam and cowpea); (ii) Improved Nutrition, through
nutrition education and advocacy and food fortification; (iii) Diversification of Livelihood Options for the
Poor, with off-farm activities linked to agriculture; (iv) Food Storage and Distribution, to reduce post-harvest
losses including capacity building of producers in better harvesting, transportation and storage methods,
introduction of grading methods and linkages between producers and markets; (v) Early Warning Systems and
Emergency Preparedness; (vi) Irrigation and Water Management; and (vii) Mechanization Services, to
increase efficiency in include planting, cultivation, harvesting and primary processing.
Program 2: Increased Growth in Incomes is closely related to Program 1, being concerned with increasing
productivity and securing farm production. It has six components: (i) Promotion of Crop, Livestock and
Fishery Production for Cash; (ii) Development of New Products; (iii) Pilot Value Chain Development; (iv)
Intensification of Farmer-based Organizations and Out-grower Concepts; (v) Development of Rural
Infrastructure; and (vi) Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture. The first component is within the major focus of
Government policy of increasing productivity of smallholder agriculture, as the critical step for increasing
incomes. Direct support to farmers to increase productivity is complemented by important activities to
develop effective marketing systems that benefit producers and consumers. Development of new products and
value chains is designed to increase returns to farmers, to generate employment and incomes along value
chains and to improve supply and quality of products reaching consumers. Rural infrastructure will be
developed to enable and assist logistics at all links in supply chains. Substantial markets for higher-value crop
commodities, especially perishables, in cities and towns offer potential to which support for urban and peri-
urban agriculture is directed.
Program 3: Increased Competitiveness and Enhanced Integration into Domestic and International
Markets reflects the changing nature of agriculture sector strategy and policy, bringing attention to expansion
and diversification of markets for farm produce. It has one component: (i) Marketing of Ghanaian Produce in
Domestic and International Markets. Two important challenges for the agriculture sector are efficient delivery

                                                      25
throughout the country of staples produced by smallholder farmers and development of markets for higher-
value products to increase incomes and satisfy consumer demand. These challenges would be met by value
chain development and specific action for market development. Development will be pursued especially for
domestic markets for staple crops and for export markets of non-traditional products of smallholder farmers.
The private sector will be encouraged to seek out and develop new markets for existing products and new
products for potential markets.
Program 4: Sustainable Management of Land and Environment attends to the critical area of maintaining
and improving the land resource on which agricultural production depends. It has a single component:
Awareness Creation and Use of SLM Technologies by Men and Women Farmers. This program would
formulate policies and regulations and improve MOFA's capacity to promote sustainable land management.
Program 5: Science and Technology Applied in Food and Agriculture Development addresses the need
for technology for sustaining and improving agricultural production through two components: (i) Uptake of
Technology along the Value Chain and Application of Biotechnology in Agriculture; and (ii) Agricultural
Research Funding and Management of Agricultural Research Information. Research is to be directed to
supporting increases in productivity and incomes (Programs 1 and 2). Mechanisms for delivering research
results to users on farms and along value chains will be developed as the critical need to ensure that the best
modern technologies are used.
Program 6: Improved Institutional Coordination responds to the need for better management of MoFA's
operations, improved interactions with other ministries and close working relationships with the private
sector. It has four components: (i) Institutional Strengthening for Intra-ministerial Coordination; (ii) Inter-
ministerial Coordination; (iii) Partnership with Private Sector and Civil Society Organizations; and (iv)
Coordination with Development Partners. This program responds to the growing need for integration of the
efforts and resources of Ghana's public and private sectors and international donor partners. The first
component would build MoFA's capacity to identify, plan and implement projects. Partnerships and
consultations with other Government ministries and agencies would ensure maximum efficiency and
effectiveness of public sector effort. Consultations and partnerships with the private sector and civil society
would be broadened and deepened.



60.    In addition to support to METASIP investments, the DPO continues to
recognize the importance of consistent and adequate funding for recurrent
expenditures, specifically for the delivery of key public goods such as extension and
animal health services that support the investments under METASIP.



                      IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO GHANA’S PROGRAM
                                             A. LINK TO CAS

61.     The proposed operation is in line with the CAS Progress Report and
contributes to CAS development targets and outcomes. Whereas the CAS envisaged a
series of three operations, the first series was discontinued after the second operation with
the view of developing a subsequent series that would be aligned to a newly emerging
policy and program environment. This AgDPO4 would be the second of the new series that
responds to the changed policy and program environment by assisting GoG to implement
METASIP. The AgDPO series continues to contribute to CAS outcomes related to
Development Target 1.2, Modernizing Agriculture, while it will also contribute to
Development Target 1.1, Financing Private Sector.

62.     The AgDPO4 remains consistent not only with the CAS, but also with the
Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy, and supports the Bank‟s commitment to harmonization,
as stated in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and, more recently, the Accra
Agenda for Action (AAA). Similarly, the AgDPO helps to implement the Africa Action

                                                     26
Plan in four of the eight focus areas: (i) strengthening the African private sector; (ii)
increasing the economic empowerment of women; (iii) building skills for competitiveness
in the global economy; and (iv) raising agricultural productivity. The AgDPO is part of the
Bank‟s action plan to scale up agriculture in Africa and support the Government‟s efforts to
establish policies and delivery mechanisms that drive agricultural growth.

        B. COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS
63.    Donor coordination has deepened in accordance with the Paris Declaration
and, more recently, the AAA endorsed at the Third High Level Forum (HLF) on Aid
Effectiveness held in Ghana in September 2008. The Bank is active in the Agriculture
Sector Working Group. Membership includes all the donors active in the sector, including
the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA)31, the German agency for international cooperation (GIZ),
the African Development Bank (AfDB), the French development agency (AFD), USAID,
the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and the Japanese International Cooperation
Agency. It includes non-traditional donors too, such as AGRA (with a large Ghana program
and regional office in Accra) and the Brazilian agricultural research and extension agency
(EMBRAPA) which manages a program of south-south cooperation. It also includes a
number of key development agencies, such as IFPRI and FAO.

64.     The CAADP Compact, signed by the Bank on behalf of all DPs, has
strengthened the framework for donor collaboration, and includes commitments to
enhance the impact of development assistance. In addition, all DPs signed a secondary
memorandum of understanding (MoU) to indicate clear support among individual DPs for
the commitments embodied in the Compact. Two additional donors not actively engaged in
the sector but supportive of sector objectives through their contributions to the MDBS (the
European Commission and UK‟s Department for International Development [DFID]) also
signed the MoU.

65.     The annual Joint Sector Review (JSR), the next of which is scheduled for June
2012, is an example of effective coordination. The JSR is an integral element of a SWAp
and reduces the transaction costs of individual DP assessments by combining them into a
single exercise. These collective assessments also facilitate a consensus on sector
performance involving all DPs and the Government, and allow concerns to be highlighted
jointly, avoiding fragmentation among donors. The 2009 and 2010 Reviews formed an
important part of the identification of the policy content for the current AgDPO series.

66.    The AgDPO continues to depend on analytical insights through economic and
sector work (ESW) supported by the Bank and other DPs. The Bank works closely with
USAID and particularly their Governance Strategy Support Program (GSSP), which is
implemented by IFPRI. Coordinated knowledge generation is also a key theme under
CAADP, with the upcoming establishment of the SAKSS as part of the CAADP Country
Team that will coordinate the implementation and monitoring of the Ghana CAADP
program, i.e. METASIP.

31
  CIDA provides sector budget support of CAN$100 million over 2009 – 13 with annual base and
performance payments (75 percent and 25 percent respectively) contingent on meeting „trigger-targets‟.
Through its Contribution Arrangement with MoFEP, CIDA funds flow through GoG channels using existing
GoG policies and procedures, but funds are allocated to MoFA.

                                                  27
67.     The AgDPO also relates to the MDBS, which provides co-financed general
budget support. GoG and DPs have agreed on a framework memorandum to guide the
relationship between their sector-specific budget support operations and general budget
support. This has been effective in limiting cross-conditionality and in identifying policy
issues best dealt with through the sectoral operations or policy dialogue and those
appropriate to be „elevated‟ to the MDBS arena.

               C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

68.     The AgDPO series constitutes an important complementary instrument to the
Bank’s existing and planned program of investment and non-lending technical
assistance operations in the agriculture and rural development sector. Investment
lending projects in the sustainable development arena have not been well suited to
supporting essential policy reforms. As articulated in the CAS Progress Report, the Bank‟s
strategy is to provide a menu of flexible general budget support; budget support with a
focus in key sectors, including agriculture; focused investment lending operations to
finance major public investments; and non-lending technical assistance to strengthen policy
and analytical capacity.

69.     The AgDPO series is directly linked with the West Africa Agricultural
Productivity Project (WAAPP; P122065, IDA US$15 million for Ghana) which is
supporting increased small-holder productivity through strengthening the regional
agricultural research systems. In this regard, it is strengthening the research-extension
linkages, and promoting more relevant research and more effective dissemination to
farmers. To sustain project outputs requires continued funding of the research extension
liaison committees, which is a specific policy measure supported by the present operation
under Policy Area 1. The WAAPP is also assisting in the technical aspects of the new
regulatory regime for seed registration to promote the availability of improved seed variety,
supported under Policy Area 1 in the DPO.

70.     The Bank’s technical assistance provided to the Government in its ongoing
efforts to develop the cotton sector is directly relevant to the general policy agenda for
the North. The development of the cotton sector in the three northern regions is expected to
increase incomes for many thousands of smallholder farmers. The Bank is providing
technical assistance in support of this process, focusing on (i) the institutional and
regulatory framework; (ii) cotton pricing; and (iii) supporting Farmer Based Organizations.

71.     Skills development and vocational training in commercial agriculture and
agribusiness is supported under the DPO‟s Policy Area 1, and will feature among priority
sectors to be included in the Skills and Technology Development Project P118112, IDA
US$70 million) which, through its skills development fund, will support capacity building
amongst farmer groups to be effective partners in out-grower schemes with commercial
nucleus farms. The non-lending technical assistance program on agricultural risk
management (P119400, Trust Fund) is building capacity for assessing (and quantifying)
agricultural risks and supporting pilot risk management measures including insurance and
other means.

72.    Similarly, by supporting Policy Areas 2 and 3, the AgDPO is closely linked with
the proposed Ghana Commercial Agriculture Project (P114264, IDA US$100 million),

                                             28
which will strengthen Government‟s efforts to leverage private investment in socially
responsible commercial agriculture and agribusiness, and will support the application of
out-grower schemes. It will build capacity among farmers and their organizations to work
with agribusiness firms, facilitating agribusiness investors in acquiring land and doing
business with the rural farming community, and providing other key public goods and
services. A number of relevant policy and institutional prior actions and triggers that
contribute to the objectives of linking farmers to markets and developing value chains
including available finance through an out-grower fund and more effective investment
incentives have been included in the AgDPO series. Technical support for improved
agricultural tenure security is also being provided under the second Land Administration
Project (P120636; IDA US$50 million.).

73.     Key policy and institutional reforms of the Ghana Fisheries Program (P124775,
US$40 million) are captured in the AgDPO under Policy Area 4. The program is part of
the West Africa Regional Fisheries Program, which includes nine coastal countries from
Mauritania to Ghana. The Program is implemented through a series of operations, each
targeting a different group of countries. The investments in Ghana will focus on
strengthening governance and management of fishery resources, as well as investments to
reduce illegal fishing and increase local value added to fish products and will support the
fisheries policy dialogue.

74.    In direct support of Policy Area 5, Bank-administered TA, funded by the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation through NEPAD (P119400) aims to develop MoFA‟s capacity
to conduct an agriculture sector public expenditure review, a series of program impact
assessments and an expenditure tracking survey. This effort will add value to the
introduction of a program-based budgeting system.

75.     The ongoing Ghana Transport Sector Project (P102000, US$225 million) has
an agricultural feeder road component, and the priority setting and resource allocation
processes are supported under the AgDPO series. The transport project includes a
component for US$50.5 million to finance the rehabilitation of rural roads, and will
establish a structured process for identifying feeder roads to be rehabilitated, giving priority
to commercial agricultural potential. The AgDPO will support this effort through improved
coordination and management of resources between MoFA and the Ministry of Roads and
Highways under Policy Area 5.

76.     The new Sustainable Land and Water Management Project (GEF, US$8
million) is working with MoFA, EPA, and the Forestry Commission to promote a
menu of technologies among smallholder farmers. The project has a strong emphasis on
the North and will promote micro watersheds, contour planting, terracing, suitable crop
rotation, and other meaningful interventions. The project would need to coordinate closely
with various MoFA programs and extension service.

77.    The current AgDPO series complements the Bank’s general budget support
operation, PRSG8, which will remain a key instrument to motivate cross-cutting policy
and institutional changes. As before, the AgDPO will continue to rely on macroeconomic
assessments and debt sustainability analysis carried out under the PRSG.



                                              29
           D. LESSONS LEARNED AND DEVELOPMENTS SINCE AGDPO3

78.     A Joint Sector Review was completed in June 2011. A number of
recommendations were made, calling for: establishment of performance-based management
of Government programs; implementation of the irrigation policy and development of a
master plan; implementation of the new seed law; implementation of the enforcement unit
of the fisheries sector; develop value chain support mechanisms; increased support to
extension services and FBOs; revitalization of RELCS; initiate dialogue on the
decentralization process and its implications for the agriculture sector; and address various
financial planning and procurement issues.

79.     As part of the CAADP implementation effort, METASIP-relevant policy
analysis and sector stakeholder dialogue are being institutionalized by MoFA. Under
the banner of the CAADP Strategic Analysis and Knowledge Support System (SAKSS),
reviews of the fertilizer subsidy and buffer stock programs are finalized. The findings will
be considered by MoFA and DPs and would inform the design of future programs. While
the reviews provide valuable information on past program performance, more strategic
analysis and planning will be needed to ensure future relevance and impact of the programs
in the context of METASIP. In this regard, Bank support may be required to support the
development of strategic plans and policies on fertilizer and seed support, and food buffer
stock operation (captured under AgDPO5).

80.     In the recently completed ICR of AgDPO1 and AgDPO2, a moderately
satisfactory outcome rating was achieved.32 The first AgDPO series contributed to
improving agricultural productivity (and food production and food security, especially in
the North), improving access to credit, strengthening export value chains, improving
fisheries sector management, and improving the agriculture sector budgetary process. While
progress was made, continued progress is required, as addressed in this second AgDPO
series.

81.    During the ICR review of AgDPO 1 and 2, discussions were held with MoFA,
MoFEP, and members of the Agriculture Sector Working Group on key conclusions
and lessons learned, which can be summarized as follows:

a) Sector Development Policy Lending has proven to be an effective and flexible
   instrument that has empowered the Government of Ghana to implement a country-
   owned policy, and implementation programs. The first AgDPO series has made a
   contribution to sector growth and enhanced food security, and has been viewed by the
   Government as being highly complementary to investment lending due to the policy
   focus that it provides, combined with "untagged" resources that it makes available.

b) The Government has experienced the AgDPO as a funding instrument that is adaptable
   to country priorities and promotes ownership of development interventions. The
   implementation arrangements are consistent with the principles of aid effectiveness,
   country ownership, leadership, management for results accountability and use of
   country systems.


32
  This rating reflects the fact that the series was discontinued after the second operation and, hence, that some
of the results were not achieved.

                                                       30
c) The design of AgDPO policy matrices and the tracking of prior actions is a major
   undertaking that needs to be better integrated in MoFA's own planning process. The
   establishment of prior actions and triggers, and related reporting requirements, needs to
   be internalized at various levels within MoFA, some of which was lacking during the
   first AgDPO series.

d) Coordination between the World Bank and CIDA's budget support programs has
   contributed to sector planning and coordination. It has provided an opportunity for
   developing an overall policy priority framework, akin to a larger policy matrix that aims
   to identify key actions that are required for the implementation of METASIP, from
   which specific prior actions and triggers can be drawn for future Bank and non-Bank
   budget support operations.

                              E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

82.     Several assessments of the implementation of the fertilizer subsidy program
have contributed to program improvements over time. Three reviews have been
undertaken: (i) a study commissioned by the Peasant Farmers Association of Ghana 33 was
based on interviews in five districts; (ii) a comprehensive description of the operation of the
2008 scheme published by IFPRI34; and (iii) a review of the fertilizer subsidy program
covering the period 2008-2011 (IFPRI/MoFA, 2012, forthcoming). The latter review
suggests that the program has resulted in higher yields and increased profitability among
recipients. The fertilizer subsidy program has evolved from a targeted voucher scheme to a
public-private partnership through which fertilizer is imported and distributed to retailers by
the private sector whereby reimbursement of the subsidy component is made upon receipt
by retailers in rural areas. Fertilizer use has doubled during the past three seasons, reaching
an estimated 150,000 tonnes in 2011. Despite the fact that fertilizer prices increased and
prices paid by farmers remained constant, overall program costs declined over the years
from GH¢478 per tonne in 2008 to GH¢351 per tonne in 2010. However, estimates for
2011 indicate that the cost may have increased to GH¢465 per tonne. A number of
shortcomings were identified, and a general concern was raised about the lack of a medium
to long term strategy, including an exit strategy for the subsidy component, confirming the
need for an inputs policy as supported under the AgDPO.

83.     A recent review of the national food buffer stock program (IFPRI/MoFA, 2012,
forthcoming) has provided useful insights. The study suggests that buffer stock
operations have so far had a minimum impact on grain markets – purchases and sales
volumes have remained small and were not reported to have affected market prices
positively or negatively and have not crowded out private sector. Minimum purchase prices
reflect estimated production costs, and actual purchase prices have so far been at or below
prevailing market prices. The review emphasized that 2010 was the first full year of buffer
stock operations during which no major price stabilization measures were deemed
necessary and that it will be important to continue the development of a rule-based
approach to market interventions and generally improve the level of transparency. These
findings confirm the relevance of a focus on enhanced transparency and the development of
a buffer stock policy, as supported under the AgDPO.

                                                      31
84.    The Bank’s Poverty Assessment provides a focus on spatial development and
the lagging regions of Northern Ghana. The report concludes that people could live well
from agriculture in Northern Ghana if low productivity was addressed by a more proactive
and spatial approach to addressing infrastructure gaps, technology and business climate
constraints. These analytical insights are currently helping shape the Commercial
Agriculture Project and a number of the policy and institutional prior actions and triggers of
the AgDPO series.

85.    The recent study on the economics of climate change in Ghana35 concludes that
Ghana‟s response to increasing temperatures includes prioritizing the development of
drought tolerant crop varieties and improving water management. These important factors
are embedded in various government programs related to seed technology development,
seed and fertilizer technology adoption, and investment planning in irrigation and water
management, all of which are supported under this AgDPO series.

86.     A variety of literature has identified agriculture as a current and future driver
of economic growth and poverty reduction in Ghana. For instance, the 2007 Country
Economic Memorandum and studies by IFPRI based on their computable general
equilibrium model identify the significant potential for agricultural growth by closing
existing yield gaps as well as additional opportunities for value addition. These studies also
confirm the wider literature on the substantial poverty reducing impact of such growth. At
the same time, the PEIR and ERPFM reports present challenges in expenditure
management and prescribed recommendations for improvements, while the PEFA 2010
report36 presented a snap-shot of expenditure management performance levels at the
national and sub-national levels that would need improvements. To address these
shortcomings, enhancing the management of METASIP programs through improved multi-
MDA planning, budgeting, and expenditure tracking is an important element of the policy
agenda supported under the AgDPO series.

87.     Analysis of the impact of the oil economy has added to the urgency of
improving the performance of agriculture as well as the potential fiscal space created by
sustainable management of revenues. Despite potential risks, Ghana‟s oil economy presents
an unparalleled opportunity for the agricultural sector and for poverty reduction in
particular. Demand for food, especially higher valued products, such as horticulture and
livestock products, will increase as incomes rise. Urbanization and urban consumer
preferences will lead to increasing demand for processed and foods with greater domestic
value-added. In addition, there may be an increasing demand for biofuels. These provide
opportunities for both farming and the food processing manufacturing sector; Government
revenues for public investment in agricultural sector will increase and help alleviate chronic
under-investment in public goods that has constrained agricultural growth.37 This
discussion will need to continue at the sector as well as the macro level.

88.    The AgDPO program draws from these studies and other specific assessments
to inform the specific measures to be supported. For example, the USAID-funded

AgCLIR diagnostic,38 (which adopts a similar approach to the Bank‟s Doing Business
Survey) identified measures to increase private investment in agriculture, including
measures to promote private sector innovation in the seed industry, and measures that
strengthen links between farmers and out-grower firms. An assessment of the scale of post-
harvest losses39 provided quantitative data on the costs of product degradation but also the
fact that in terms of remedial measures one size does not fit all – i.e. that the cause and
extent of losses differs across commodities and between value chains.40 A recent (2010)
World Bank/IFPRI study on gender and governance in rural services pointed to the need to
improve the management of the agricultural extension system, in particular with a view of
better reaching female farmers. FAO assessments41 document the failure of past efforts at
expanding irrigation schemes and in particular the institutional challenges to sustainable
management, noting that management by users is associated with better irrigation
performance and the resulting increased incomes benefit all household members. 42 Recent
analytical work by the Bank has highlighted the threats to Ghana‟s marine fisheries and the
urgent need for improved management of the fishing fleet.43



                V.       THE PROPOSED FOURTH GHANA AGRICULTURE
                              DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION

                                    A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

89.    AgDPO4 will be the second in the current series of three operations (AgDPO3,
4, and 5). The current series follows an earlier series of two AgDPOs. It continues to
build on Ghana's agriculture policy (FASDEP II) and continues to support the
implementation of Ghana's Medium Term Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (METASIP).

90.    During the preparation of AgDPO3, five policy areas were identified where the
three year programmatic AgDPO series could generate recognized value-added towards
implementation of METASIP:

       i.         Development of and funding for demand-driven agricultural technology for
                  improved on-farm productivity, including extension and education, seed and
                  fertilizer technology adoption and input market development;
      ii.         Improving farmers' market access and market performance, facilitation of
                  out-grower schemes, investment promotion, and finance;

   See AgCLIR Ghana: Commercial, legal and Institutional Reform Diagnostic of Ghana’s Agricultural
Sector, USAID (2008).
39
   For instance, 60 percent of main-season mango production is lost (almost half of this due to poor storage at
the market). Losses for cereals are much lower, at about 6 percent – 18 percent, with much of this during
harvesting operations. Loss rates for vegetables (between 10 percent – 20 percent) are attributed particularly
to damage during transport.

    iii.       Improving irrigated agriculture, including development of new irrigation
               infrastructure through PPPs, and development of other infrastructure such as
               feeder roads;
    iv.        Improving the management of the marine and inland fisheries sector,
               including conservation of fish stock;
     v.        Improving agriculture sector management, priority setting, and resource
               allocation.

91.     Each of these areas offers significant opportunities to enhance the
competitiveness and productivity of Ghanaian agriculture and improve effectiveness
and efficiency of public spending in the agriculture sector. Government is committed to
the current agricultural policy and its implementation programs and has taken full
ownership and leadership. Continuation of this commitment is required for the successful
implementation of the AgDPO series. The ability to generate impact in terms of sector
competitiveness and effectiveness, and efficiency of public spending, rests on the
assumption that FASDEP II, the CAADP Compact, and METASIP remain the key
references for establishing priorities in the allocation and execution of public expenditures
in the agriculture sector. Given that public expenditures in agriculture go beyond those
allocated to and executed by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, this assumption extends
to other relevant MDAs as well. Implicit in the CAADP Compact and METASIP, and
thereby the proposed policy and institutional areas to be covered under the second AgDPO
series, is the premise that public facilitation will generate the space and incentives for
substantial private investments in agriculture.

           B. POLICY AREAS TO BE SUPPORTED UNDER THE OPERATION

92.     The priority policy areas to be supported under AgDPO4 remain consistent
with METASIP and have been confirmed with the Government. They include: (i)
agricultural technology for improved on-farm productivity; (ii) market and value chain
development; (iii) irrigation and other infrastructure; (iv) fisheries; and (v) agriculture
sector management. Within each area a number of specific policy objectives have been
specified and agreed. Table 8 presents the prior actions for AgDPO4. The policy matrix is
presented in Annex 3.

Policy Area 1. Agricultural technology for improved on-farm productivity

Policy Objective: Improved research, extension services, skills training and education in
agricultural sciences and farm management

93.    Coordination and planning is required to ensure that agriculture research and
technology transfer priorities are reflected in budgets and programs, and are
implemented. A number of actions have been identified for implementation under this
AgDPO series that will improve the relevance of research and mainstream agricultural
research in the sector planning and budgeting process. In order to support demand-driven
research and extension services, MoFA has undertaken to provide funding for agricultural
research, based on the research needs identified by the multi-stakeholder Research
Extension Liaison Committees (RELCs), as supported by the previous operation. The new
Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Policy and the STI Development Program,
developed by the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology, reflect an increased
                                             34
focus by Government on mainstreaming STI into agriculture sector programs and budgets.
Its operational value lies in its multi-sector approach which will be applied to the new
program-based budgeting system (see policy objective Agriculture Sector Management),
thus feeding into METASIP.

94.     The STI Policy focuses on improving the science advisory system, improving
applied research infrastructure, and training and skills development in science and
technology institutions. Agriculture sector specific priorities identified in the STI Policy
include among others: strengthening the linkages between research and agricultural
extension (consistent with the RELCs‟ mandate), agricultural technology development,
reduction of pre- and post-harvest losses, and developing food processing industries. The
policy is also linked to the ECOWAS treaty on STI that promotes regional cooperation, and
the NEPAD S&T Consolidated Plan of Action. Implementation of the STI Development
Program would promote policy consistency between the STI Policy, FASDEP and
METASIP, as well as develop implementation capacity. The approval of the STI Policy and
Development Program by Cabinet is a prior action for AgDPO4 and has been met.

95.     Agriculture sector STI projects and activities are to be captured in a national-
level STI investment plan, as well as in the national budget. The approach will require
strong guidance and input from MoFA, CSIR, RELCs and other stakeholders to improve
monitoring and coordination among farmers, public and private research and technology
groups, and public and private extension capabilities to ensure that demand-driven,
innovative, and appropriate technology is disseminated effectively and adopted by end-
users. As the agriculture sector STI agenda is developed and feeds into METASIP planning,
a results-based impact monitoring system of adaptive research and extension will be
established. The establishment of a research and extension monitoring system has been
identified as a trigger for AgDPO5.

96.      In support of scaling up agricultural research and extension, the human
resource base needs to be developed and maintained. Skills training, education, and
research and technology development should be demand-driven at all levels. Currently,
coordination among training and education providers is poor and capacity to deliver is
lacking. Formal training providers at university, polytechnic and college levels face human
and other capacity constraints. The Bank-funded Skills and Technology Development
Project will operate a skills development fund that may support relevant capacity building
efforts.

Policy Objective: Adoption of agricultural input technology

97.      Recent increases in crop production are partly attributable to productivity
gains, not only area expansion. Continued technology development and dissemination
efforts have the potential to further increase sector performance. While the uptake of
fertilizer has increased, the availability and use of certified seed among smallholder farmers
in Ghana remains extremely low. The recent review by IFPRI/MoFA (2012, forthcoming)
concluded that there has been an increase in application of fertilizer and a substantial
increase in yields and profitability among users. However, fertilizer alone is not the „silver
bullet‟, and in order to achieve the full productivity potential, fertilizer application must be
complemented by the use of improved seed varieties. Private sector technology innovation


                                              35
and dissemination has been largely stifled by restrictive legislation and regulations.44
However, the Government has made considerable progress on the implementation of new
seed legislation. As supported under AgDPO3, a new national plants and fertilizer bill was
passed in June 2010.45 In tandem with the promotion of fertilizer technology and improved
farm management practices, the new law has the potential to address what is perhaps the
most critical productivity-related constraint among Ghanaian smallholder farmers.
Implementation of the new legislation is expected to make it attractive for international
seed companies to invest in Ghana.

98.      Three Advisory Councils will oversee the development a new technical
regulatory framework that will change the current structure of the seed, plant
protection and fertilizer sectors. The establishment of the three Advisory Councils is a
result of extensive stakeholder input that went into the new Plants and Fertilizer Act, which
provides for the establishment and sets out the functions of each Council. The Plant
Protection and Regulatory Services Department (PPRSD) at MoFA will provide a
secretariat function to the three councils and will need to make adjustments to its structure
to accommodate these new responsibilities. The three Councils having been constituted and
funded is a prior action for AgDPO4 and has been met. The 2012 MoFA budget includes
funding for key functions and activities to be performed by the three councils, such as the
development and implementation of regulations, facilitation of a new inputs policy,
convening of council and committee meetings, and completion of a new seed laboratory.
Agencies such as IFDC and AGRA have been supporting the Government in the seed sector
and their experience should be leveraged. Other institutional reforms will require careful
planning. Whereas foundation seed is currently produced by the Grains and Legumes Board
and breeder seed is produced by CSIR, both as virtual monopolies, private companies will
have to be able to obtain licenses to perform these functions. The roles of the Grains and
Legumes Board, and CSIR will therefore change, and this will be reflected in their
institutional structure.

99.     Functioning input markets are needed where seed technology is offered to
farmers as a package, combined with fertilizer and agrochemicals. The seed
distribution system in Ghana is currently underdeveloped with 291 seed retailers versus
2,350 fertilizer retail outlets. Constraints include the erratic and insufficient supply of
reliable technology, and a lack of effective demand. The ongoing fertilizer subsidy initiative
has the potential to evolve into a program that will generate demand for improved seed
products by encouraging private sector participation in input markets and make fertilizer
and complementary inputs available to more farmers at affordable prices and eventually
commercially sustainable market prices.

100. Building on a strengthened fertilizer subsidy program, as supported by the
previous operation, MoFA is currently developing a program that promotes fertilizer
use in conjunction with certified seed. Various development agencies, including IFDC
and AGRA, have been supporting the development of the private sector network of some
2,900 agro-input dealers, working with EPA and the private sector. It is expected that these
efforts will support Government activities aimed at improving its input support programs.

44
   For example, only two international hybrid maize varieties have been introduced in Ghana in recent years.
Under the new seed law, technology development by seed technology firms would be encouraged.
45
   See Ghana Plants and Fertilizer Act, September 2010

                                                     36
During 2012, approximately 150,000 tonnes of fertilizer are expected to be subsidized,
following the same modalities as in 2011.46 In addition, based on expected seed stocks
supplied by seed growers, 151,000 bags of seed will be distributed through the private
sector network, which currently covers approximately 290, of which 250 also sell fertilizer.
Given that a total of 2,350 agro-dealers sell fertilizer country-wide, a medium term goal
would be to increase the number of dealers that sell both fertilizer and seed (and preferably
agro-chemicals). The planned intervention for the 2012 season will complement fertilizer
for approximately 25 percent of farmers and is restricted by the existing limitations of the
production of certified seed and dealer network coverage. This performance is expected to
improve over time as seed technology production capacity and seed marketing and
distribution networks develop. The development of implementation modalities for the 2012
agricultural input support program is a prior action for AgDPO4 and has been met. The
design has been informed by findings of the recently completed review of the 2010 and
2011 fertilizer subsidy programs by MoFA/IFPRI, and an internal operational review. A
retail sales monitoring system has been introduced that would reduce possible leakages to
neighboring countries, and the administrative system has been adapted to become less time
consuming and enable speedier reimbursement to private companies. Private sector
fertilizer and seed suppliers have been identified through a transparent process and have
been consulted on the operational modalities. This expanded public-private partnership
arrangement will be an appropriate platform to clarify the policy environment over the
medium term and agree on the direction and ingredients of the agricultural input support
program.

101. In the medium term, an agricultural inputs policy will be required. As a
proportion of total expenditure allocations for MoFA, the fertilizer subsidy program has
increased from 10 percent in 2008 to 30 percent in 2011. The opportunity cost of the
program needs to be considered, while recognizing that a subsidy that introduces a new
productivity (and profitability) enhancing technology is by definition a temporary policy
measure. Once the uptake of fertilizer and seed technology starts to result in productivity
gains that in turn translate into increased effective demand for commercially priced inputs
among commercially viable farmers, the program‟s focus would be expected to shift over
time from input price support to providing other types of support, for example aimed at
increasing the commercial viability of input and/or output markets. These considerations
will require an updated policy on agricultural inputs, which would be reflected in
subsequent input support programs. Key elements of the policy include (i) clarifying the
role of the private sector in technology development, seed multiplication, distribution, and
knowledge transfer, and (ii) clarifying the role of the government regarding the regulatory
environment, promotional programs such as the fertilizer and seed subsidy program,
including the medium and long term. The new policy would be used to inform the design of
subsequent input support programs. The development of the agricultural inputs support
program for 2013 that reflects key elements of the new policy is a trigger for AgDPO5.




46
  While the implementation modalities have been developed, the proposed reduced subsidy component of
30% is subject to the outcome of ongoing price negotiations with participating firms.

                                                  37
Policy Area 2: Market and Value Chain Development

Policy Objective: Increased participation of smallholders

102. Despite an overall increase in short term agriculture sector lending by
commercial banks, the provision of longer term commercial finance for investments in
agriculture remains a key constraint. However, Government and DPs are responding
to these constraints. AGRA has introduced a „first loss‟ loan guarantee that covers 10
percent of a maximum US$25 million loan portfolio with Stanbic Bank, although loan
disbursements to date have been slow. MoFA, with the assistance from KfW, recently
established an Out-grower Value Chain Fund (OVCF) that supports out-grower activities
and will expand processing and marketing capacity with long term credit.

103. The Export Development and Agricultural Investment Fund (EDAIF) will be
another source of funding for agriculture sector promotion and agribusiness credit
provision. The previously existing Export Development Investment Fund (EDIF) has been
adapted to incorporate an agriculture window for the provision of funds to promote
agriculture and agro-processing, and provide credit, refinancing and credit guarantees
through financial institutions. The adaptation of EDIF to incorporate agribusiness
investments and become the Export Development and Agricultural Investment Fund,
incorporating an investment fund window for agriculture, and the development of
guidelines for the operation of the investment fund window is a prior action for AgDPO4
and has been met. The EDIF Amendment Bill was approved by Cabinet, and was
subsequently passed by Parliament in October 2011. Fund guidelines and modalities for the
agriculture portion of the fund (approximately 35 percent of the total, approximately
GH¢40 million) have been prepared by MoFA, and three windows have been identified: A
credit window is planned for medium to long term lending, using the existing OVCF and
the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) program (under the Ministry of Trade
and Industry), as appropriate. A matching grant window is planned for the establishment of
out-grower schemes, including the introduction of new technology and business
development services, complementary to the Ghana Commercial Agriculture Project and
the MSME program, using existing implementation modalities. A public investment
window is planned to finance specific strategic infrastructure, and research and
development investments that are aimed at supporting commercial investments, using
existing implementation capacity under the Commercial Agriculture Project, Feeder Roads
Department, and the various agriculture research institutes. In addition, the public
investment window may finance PPPs in the agriculture sector through the PPP facility (a
viability gap fund), as per the new PPP Policy, and supported under the Bank-funded Ghana
PPP Project. Implementation of these modalities would be a departure from the existing
EDIF modalities by which funds were channeled through commercial banks at subsidized
rates, with limited success.

104. Farmers need to be integrated into commercial value chains rather than
depend on haphazard and unpredictable market opportunities. As supported by the
previous AgDPO series and by CIDA, Government has made progress in strengthening the
role and functioning of farmer-based organizations (FBOs), both through capacity building
and actively facilitating FBOs to be included in commercial out-grower and contract-
farming enterprises. The process of integrating agribusiness investment with FBO and out-


                                            38
grower development is supported by the current AgDPO series and by the Commercial
Agriculture Project.

105. Many agribusiness companies depend largely on smallholder output, and it is
in their interest to establish sustainable business models. Companies require structured
engagement with rural communities to acquire land, establish out-grower arrangements, and
develop a business model that derives an important element of its efficiency and
competitiveness from the rural community in the form of a predictable raw material supply
chain. The creation of such business ventures calls for a dedicated investment promotion
and facilitation effort, including further developing and implementing the „land bank‟
approach that seeks to provide an opportunity for rural communities to identify suitable
business partners, and provide investors with suitable land and tenure security. As part of
the Commercial Agriculture Project, a land bank initiative is currently being prepared,
involving Customary Land Secretariats, for the identification of land for out-grower
investments in the northern region and the Accra Plains. Land availability identified
through the land bank process, and detailed technical information on topography,
hydrology, soils, infrastructure, and economic and financial feasibility estimates would be
made publicly available to potential investors, following which public investments and
other support measures can be planned and implemented.

106. A comprehensive approach for out-grower investment promotion is required,
encompassing facilitation and capacity building at farmer and investor levels, also adopting
the Principles of Responsible Agricultural Investments that promotes equitable and
sustainable business practices. It will involve close coordination among the Lands
Commission, MoFA, the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre, FBOs and private sector
associations and other interested parties that will provide facilitation services related to land
leases, and establishing business arrangements between investors and rural communities.
The development and institutionalization of a national framework for out-grower
investment promotion and FBO out-grower facilitation is a trigger for AgDPO5. This
involves, among others, the development and use of a “model lease agreement? between
investors and out-grower communities that spells out land tenure as well as benefit sharing
arrangements, especially as it affects female farmers. Second, it involves the formalization
of the role of the Lands Commission in providing land audit and mediation services, again
with a special reference to female farmers‟ land rights. Third, farming communities and
farmer organizations will require capacity development to improve their readiness for
relationships with investors, which requires a public-private sector approach. Support for
the implementation of a national framework will be provided under the Commercial
Agriculture Project and the Land Administration Project.

Policy Objective: Improved performance of grain markets

107. In support of private sector development in grain markets, transparency will
be provided by disseminating the operational modalities of the National Food Buffer
Stock Company, outlining the modalities for buffer stock purchases and sales, including
the methodology for determining buying and selling prices and expected purchase volumes.
Price information has been announced in the media in May and November 2011, and details
of licensed buying companies have been provided through all MoFA district offices. A
complete set of modalities have been posted on the MoFA website, including estimated
purchase volumes. The dissemination of operational modalities of buffer stock operations

                                               39
has been identified as a prior action for AgDPO4 and has been met. In addition to the
dissemination of modalities, a consultative meeting to discuss the proposed modalities took
place in October. The dissemination of the 2011/12 modalities has achieved the important
objective of ensuring transparency and a degree of predictability in the market, while
minimizing the likelihood of these modalities distorting markets. The government has
disseminated information on (a) intended commodity purchase volumes; (b) buying prices
and the methodology for determining these prices; (c) names and contact details of private
companies that buy from farmers on behalf of the buffer stock company; and (d) general
information about the role of the buffer stock company. Hence, the emphasis of the prior
action is on the provision of transparency by the Government. Food buffer stock prices are
determined to range from cost of production at a minimum, and prevailing market prices at
a maximum. Actual buying prices to date have been below or at par with commercial
buying prices. In addition, purchased volumes have been small (less than 5 percent of total
maize production), and respondents in the recent review of the buffer stock program
(IFPRI/MoFA, forthcoming) indicated that no market distortions have been experienced
during the 2010/11 harvest season. The next phase is the implementation of a new buffer
stock policy that clarifies the various objectives and possible interventions, while
continuing and improving transparency.

108. However, there should be a continued focus on analytical work, in line with
joint sector review recommendations, being supported by IFPRI and the Bank.
Although the recent review of food buffer stock operations concluded that market
distortions have been negligible, future interventions in grain markets may potentially
exacerbate market unpredictability and may increase risk along the value chains. The buffer
stock program is ostensibly about price stabilization and disaster preparedness, but it
appears to incorporate elements of „buyer of last resort‟ for the staple food grains maize,
rice and soya, including a guaranteed (floor) price for farmers. While modest in scale to
date (mainly because of fiscal constraints), a large and poorly managed scheme has the
potential to generate substantial distortions in the market and retard private investment in
storage, trading, and processing, thereby exacerbating the problems it is trying to solve. An
analytical foundation is required that would identify (a) marketing constraints faced by
farmers; (b) price volatility in food markets; and (c) trade flows that would smoothen price
volatility, based on which specific objectives of interventions and rule-based
implementation arrangements can be determined. Based on this analytical foundation, a
food marketing and buffer stock policy can be developed, aimed at providing incentives for
private sector participation in food markets and processing, while maintaining provisions
for emergencies, preferably utilizing market-based mechanisms. As part of the analytical
work, the current arrangements whereby food grains produced under the Block Farm
Program are sold to the buffer stock company will require clarification.

109. To increase private sector investment, improve market efficiency and reduce
price volatility, Government has endorsed the development of a Warehouse Receipt
System (WRS) that will: (a) provide a market place for farmers; (b) encourage
stockholding; (c) stimulate trade; (d) improve market transparency and price discovery; and
(e) provide collateral to leverage commercial credit. The WRS pilot phase, whose
establishment was supported under the previous operation, is driven by the private sector in
the form of the Ghana Grains Council (GGC), representing FBOs, traders, and processors,
some of whom will be managing eight certified warehouses. GGC has established its
internal rules and regulations (September 2011) and is now working with the Securities and

                                             40
Exchange Commission and the Ministry of Trade and Industry to identify legislative
requirements for the WRS as well as for a Commodity Exchange, the latter being a logical
next step following the implementation of the WRS. Submission of legislation facilitating
the Warehouse Receipt System to Parliament is a trigger for AgDPO5. Further design and
implementation of the warehouse receipts system and a complementary commodities
exchange will require technical and legal work, some of which is currently provided by the
ACDI/VOCA-USAID-funded ADVANCE program and UNDP. IFC has also expressed an
interest in providing advisory services to guide the implementation process.

Policy Area 3. Irrigation and Other Infrastructure

Policy Objective: Improved irrigated agriculture

110. New regulations on joint management of irrigation schemes were approved and
constitute an important step forward in that they encourage farmers to take
responsibility for the upkeep of infrastructure, and allow public-private partnerships
to develop. The irrigation policy emphasizes the role of private, non-state actors in the
development and management of large and small scale irrigation schemes, which is
important if irrigation is expected to play a pivotal role in increasing productivity and
supporting agricultural development in Ghana. The creation of PPPs in large scale, capital
intensive irrigation ventures will further enhance private investments in agriculture, such as
the ones envisaged for the Commercial Agriculture Program. The priority of investing in
inland valley development is also recognized.

111. Confirming the new direction of the irrigation sector, a pre-feasibility study of
the proposed expansion of the Kpong irrigation scheme, covering 11,000 ha on the
right bank (West) of the Volta in the Accra Plains has been completed. The study was
funded by JICA and directly supports MoFA and GIDA‟s planned investment, most likely
through a PPP transaction that would leverage private investment in commercial out-grower
schemes, with financing support through the proposed Bank-funded Commercial
Agriculture Project. Financing from the Chinese Development Bank brings in additional
opportunities as well as challenges that will require close coordination between GoG, the
Bank, and other development partners.

112. Recognizing the need to operationalize demand-led investment planning, a new
irrigation sector investment framework is being prepared. GIDA has taken the initiative
to introduce a new approach to irrigation sector planning that provides for a demand-driven
and prioritized investment framework, catering for different irrigation and water
management client groups.47

113. The operational value of the new investment framework lies in its utility for
annual resource planning and implementation purposes as it allows for an annual
rolling investment plan that is designed to operationalize METASIP’s irrigation
component. The first step is the development of a Pre-investment Reform Action

47
  The approach has been informed by the collaborative program entitled Investment in Agricultural Water for
Poverty Reduction and Economic Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, prepared jointly by the World Bank, African
Development Bank, FAO, IFAD, IWMI and NEPAD. A Partnership on Agricultural Water Management in
Africa (AgWA) was subsequently created during 2010, operating as an expert pool on agricultural water
management in support of CAADP implementation.

                                                    41
Framework that defines the operational approach for developing an investment pipeline for
different irrigation business lines, recognizing the needs and roles of farmers, private
investors, and specific irrigation needs and potential in geographical zones, notably the
North. Moreover, it confirms the restructuring of the Ghana Irrigation Development
Authority (GIDA), including the management of state-owned irrigation schemes. The
completion of the new irrigation sector Pre-investment Reform Action Framework is a prior
action for AgDPO4 and has been met. This prior action was originally identified as a trigger
referring to the irrigation sector Master Plan, a more traditional engineering-focused
medium term investment plan for the sector that has now been replaced by the more
appropriate action-oriented investment framework.

114. GIDA is in need of an organizational and management restructuring. Its roles
need to refocus to those of a sector planner, regulator, advisor, supervisor and public
service provider. A fundamental principle of system management is that GIDA is not
involved in day-to-day irrigation system management. The restructuring of GIDA is a
trigger for AgDPO5. The full implementation of the restructuring will be guided by the Pre-
Investment Framework. Additional continuity of support can be expected through the
Commercial Agriculture Project that will work closely with GIDA in implementing various
irrigation investments that are consistent with GIDA‟s new role as service provider and
investment facilitator.

115. Investments in rural road infrastructure are essential and need to be
prioritized. To ensure optimum allocation of scarce resources for capital-intensive
investments in road infrastructure, efforts are currently underway to agree upon priorities
for feeder road investments by the Ministry of Roads and Highways and Ministry of Food
and Agriculture. In addition, the Deputy Director at MoFA in charge of investment
planning is a member of the Infrastructure Committee of NDPC, and the agriculture
window of EDAIF is expected to provide funding for selected road infrastructure needs.

Policy Area 4. Fisheries

Policy Objective: Improved management of the fisheries sector

116. Ghana’s fisheries sector accounts for approximately 4.5 percent of GDP and is
in need of drastic measures to protect it from decline. Including aquaculture, the country
produces some 440,000 tons of fish from its waters each year, worth some US$790 million.
Furthermore, as many as 2.2 million people are dependent on the fisheries sector for their
livelihoods, including some 135,000 fishers in the marine sector (of which 92 percent are
artisanal fishers). It is estimated that a further 71,000 artisanal fishers operate in Lake
Volta. These figures underscore the prominent role that fisheries currently play in the
Ghanaian economy, as they have done for many generations past. The Fisheries
Commission has been empowered by the Government to manage the sector. The
Commission‟s Secretariat is housed at MoFA.

117. The Ghana Fisheries and Aquaculture Sector Development Plan (2011 - 2016)
was approved by Cabinet in October 2011. The plan has a phased approach, raising
awareness of all stakeholders on the key steps and their potential benefits. Actions and costs
of implementing the plan will be supported by the recently approved Ghana Fisheries
Project, and by other DPs. Expected outcomes from a revitalized fisheries sector in Ghana

                                             42
include: improved sector governance and robust fisheries governance institutions;
environmentally sustainable, socially equitable and economically profitable fish resources;
reduced illegal fishing through strengthened monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) of
fisheries licenses and regulations; and increased value added benefits from fish resources
captured by the country. With the approval of the plan, the Fisheries Enforcement Unit as
described in the 2002 Fisheries Act, including an interagency Steering Committee and
memorandum of understanding, can now be established.

118. The enforcement of licensing and registration of the industrial and semi-
industrial fleet, and restricting new entry, are the first and most essential steps in
closing access to the resources and restoring profitability and sustainability to the
sector. Due to delays in the approval process of the Bank-funded Ghana Fisheries Project
and the corresponding development plan, the Fisheries Enforcement Unit has yet to be
established, which implies that part of the trigger originally planned for AgDPO4
(registration and licensing of all industrial and semi-industrial fishing vessels completed)
cannot be met. However, significant progress has been made on the implementation of the
licensing regime for industrial fishing vessels. An audit of the industrial trawler fleet has
commenced, resulting in the identification of 61 inactive vessels from the license register,
which represents a substantial portion of industrial fishing vessels. The auditing process
continues, also for the semi-industrial fleet. The audit, inspection and revocation of licenses
have been confirmed in a recent directive from the Minister of Food and Agriculture that
also suspended the issuing of new licenses until further notice (as per the originally planned
prior action). The directive also announced further enforcement of the fisheries law, and
health and safety with a view to curtail any illegal operation of trawl vessels by revoking or
not renewing licenses among vessels that are not in compliance. The imposition of a
suspension on issuing new licenses, including the commencement of updating the industrial
and semi-industrial license register, is a prior action that has been met.

119. To support the implementation of the Fisheries Act, regulations have been
issued. However, the regulations issued in 2010 could have benefited from further
refinement prior to approval, including on the various issues raised by the World Bank. Due
to pressure from the fishing community, the Government submitted them to Parliament for
approval before taking on board suggestions for refinement. In order to ensure full
implementation of the Fisheries and Aquaculture Sector Development Plan, it would
therefore be necessary to further review and improve the regulations, particularly with
respect to (i) defining the criteria for granting licenses; (ii) specifying that Ghana has clear
authority to regulate under international law, especially regarding foreign fishing vessels,
clarifying the compliance regime; and (iii) specifying provisions to regulate fishing effort
either through vessel control, or fishing quotas. Completion of this additional review
exercise is a trigger for AgDPO5. The Ghana Fisheries Project may contribute towards this
process in the context of the broader review of the legal framework for fisheries.

Policy Area 5. Sector Coordination

Policy Objective: Enhanced delivery of agriculture sector investment program

120. The CAADP framework and METASIP call for inter-MDA coordination to
ensure delivery. The METASIP governance structure provides a management, research
(SAKSS), and dialogue mechanism compatible with the continental CAADP framework.

                                              43
The CAADP Country Team‟s Steering Committee in Ghana was formed under AgDPO3,
representing an expanded group of CAADP Compact signatories as sector stakeholders that
oversees and manages the METASIP implementation process. Support through the NEPAD
CAADP structure is forthcoming in the form of assistance to SAKSS (through IFPRI).

121. To complement these coordination efforts, sector-wide resource allocation,
budgeting, and expenditure tracking systems are being strengthened. While the current
system is sufficiently robust for successful implementation of a budget support lending
instrument, a number of areas for improvement could increase the impact of resources
flowing through governmental systems. Of particular concern is the lack of a system that
defines and identifies agriculture spending across MDAs. To address such concerns across
sectors, Government is in the process of developing a new program-based budgeting
process by which the Ghana growth strategy‟s (GSGDA) objectives and METASIP
program components are linked, and used to identify agriculture expenditure for each
MDA. This has produced a program-based, METASIP-compatible budget framework for
2012 (in parallel with the current budget format). It is scheduled for full implementation
during preparation of the 2013 budget. The development of a methodology that identifies
agriculture spending for planning and budgeting purposes across MDAs, and its application
to identify agriculture spending in two other ministries (Environment, Science and
technology, and Trade and Industry) is a prior action for AgDPO4 that has been met.

122. Implementation of multi-MDA program-based budgeting will ultimately
produce sector performance reports, evaluating sector-wide budget allocation and
expenditure, and reporting on sector outcomes. The inclusion of a sector-wide report on
budget allocation in MoFA‟s annual report is a trigger for AgDPO5. In addition to the
establishment of agriculture budget and expenditure tracking systems, capacity needs to be
developed within Government for assessing the impact of investments and interventions, a
process that feeds back into program design and budgeting. This effort will be supported by
Bank-administered TA on agriculture expenditure review, tracking and impact assessment,
commissioned by NEPAD with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

123. A summary of the Prior Actions for AgDPO4 is provided in Table 8 below. The
overall Policy Matrix for the series is presented in Annex 3.

                         VI.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                           A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

124. FASDEP II focuses both on growth and on poverty, and addresses regional
differences in agricultural growth. In the short-term to medium term, selected commodities
(in particular staple crops) are to be targeted to improve food security and promote income
diversification, based on comparative and competitive advantages, promoting sustainable land
management approaches given that many of the poorer areas are also challenged by difficult
agro-ecological conditions. In addition, smallholder commercialization and linkages to
industry for selected indigenous agricultural commodities has been recognized as a strategy
for poverty reduction.

125. In collaboration with the Ghana Commercial Agriculture Project (GCAP), the
Government will undertake an assessment of poverty and social impacts of investments
in agriculture productivity and commercialization, as part of the project activities
informing the specific models of socially inclusive commercial agriculture. The PSIA will
be consultative in nature, involving sector stakeholders, communities, and the existing
coordination and consultation mechanisms (including the METASIP Steering Committee),
building on the consultations carried out during the preparation of METASIP and GCAP. The
PSIA will recommend changes in policy direction as determined by the analysis. It is
envisioned that the PSIA is conducted during the course of 2012, in time to inform AgDPO5.

126. Government interventions supported under the operation display a strong focus
on addressing the development challenges of the North. Support to the distribution of
agricultural inputs, by virtue of the focus on food commodities, has covered the northern
regions extensively, and food production has in fact increased disproportionately in these
regions. The Ghana Commercial Agriculture Project will encompass the Northern
Breadbasket Strategy, and strengthen the capacity of the Savanna Accelerated Development
Authority (SADA). At the policy level, METASIP incorporates two notable innovations in
Government policy on targeted beneficiaries. The first is the increased emphasis on the food
crops sector. The second is the parallel effort to scale-up sizeable investments in commercial
agriculture and for these to include out-grower arrangements. Some of the large-scale
commercial farms were identified in the original PSIA which recommended that in pursuing
commercial opportunities, links to smallholders be made.

127. With regard to the specific measures of the operation, positive poverty and social
impacts are expected and while the operation does not have an explicit regional focus, the
operation contributes to the Government‟s efforts to target regional disparities. First, by
focusing on measures to improve the productivity of food crops the target beneficiaries are, by
implication, poor small-holder farmers. They dominate the food crop sector; these farmers are
the primary beneficiaries of the public extension system and they also suffer the most severe
post-harvest losses. Second, poor subsistence farmers depend more heavily on FBOs – larger
enterprises have sufficient critical mass and managerial capacity themselves – and increased
capacity among FBOs to conduct business with agribusiness firms will benefit many rural
households.

128. Given the gendered division of labor in Ghana’s agriculture, gender aspects
require specific attention. Rural poverty is significantly more prevalent among male-headed

                                              48
household than female-headed households in Ghana. Women derive income from trading,
processing and vegetable farming, and provide farm labor during planting and harvest time.
Other than perhaps vegetable farming, agriculture production is mostly managed by males.
Access to land and competing demands on women‟s time are among the constraints that
prevent female farmers from developing a farm enterprise. Market access, access to finance,
adoption of seed and fertilizer technology, and the uptake of warehouse receipts are all areas
with distinct gender dimensions. In response to these constraints, gender-relevant planning
has been incorporated in the FBO Development Fund which, under the Agricultural Services
program, provided resources to train a total of 1,480 farmers from 296 FBOs on enterprise
development. Women farmers formed 40 percent of beneficiaries of this capacity building
effort. Moreover, the District-level FBO Development Fund Steering Committees is required
to include women representation. Gender Responsive Budgeting (GRB) has been adopted
within MoFA. Under the Gender Agricultural Development Strategy, a gender gap and
situational analysis has been carried out in 2011 and the block farm program and fertilizer
subsidy program were identified as priority programs under which gender gaps should be
addressed, mostly related to women‟s poor access to agricultural inputs and extension
services. The PSIA will include a gender component and make recommendations that are
relevant for government policies and programs, including GCAP.

129. Subsistence farmers are most dependent on rain-fed agriculture, often adopt
unsustainable agricultural practices, and are most at risk from increased weather
variability induced by climate change. Therefore, measures to promote sustainable land
management practices and more efficient and extensive use of small-scale irrigation schemes,
e.g. through inland valley water development, will be of direct benefit. The development and
distribution of drought-tolerant seed varieties is another important aspect of climate change-
related risk management.

130. The magnitude of the fertilizer subsidy in the Government’s program warrants
special attention. The government has scaled up the program while improving its efficiency
and its economic viability. As such, the program appears to provide real benefits to
smallholders through improved productivity in key food staples and increased incomes.
(These programs target poor yet commercially viable smallholder farmers who have the
potential of using fertilizer technology, and typically do not help the extreme poor who are
unable to access even subsidized fertilizer and/or those unable to farm.) However, the
opportunity cost of the resources needs to be identified, as there is a potential risk of
displacement of resources from other priority interventions because of escalating costs of the
subsidy. This risk is mitigated by the ongoing policy dialogue and the upcoming formulation
of an agricultural inputs policy.

                              B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

131. With reference to OP8.60, the policy measures supported by the operation are
not expected to have significant effects on the environment. There may be beneficial
effects arising from actions aimed at strengthening the management of land, soil and water
and the promotion of good agricultural practices, as per Policy Areas 1, 2 and 3. The low use
of fertilizer is currently causing severe soil nutrient depletion, and increased fertilizer use
combined with improved soil management would contribute to the restoration of soils and the
improvement of soil fertility. Also, agricultural intensification would likely result in reduced
encroachment on forests. Improved fisheries management under Policy Area 4 will result in

                                              49
conservation of fish stocks. The FASDEP policy, as reflected in the METASIP, states the
importance of improving the implementation of sector environmental impact assessments and
strengthening land and water management. This has a bearing not just on environmental
resources and services but also on the productivity of the sector itself and on the well-being of
the people of Ghana. Food safety, good agricultural practices (including careful use of
pesticides, fertilizer, hygienic practices), soil and water management will be emphasized in
policy dialogue and the implementation of the FASDEP through METASIP. A fundamental
focus is on increasing productivity through improved agricultural practices, rather than
increasing production through area expansion. Careful implementation of government policy
will thus have positive effects on the environment.

132. Ghana has a robust environmental institutional framework and considerable
capacities to set environmental management standards. The main frameworks are the
1991 National Environmental Policy, the 1992 National Environmental Action Plan, and the
1994 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Act. This framework laws give an adequate
reflection of the national environmental policy objectives, seeking to reconcile economic
development and natural resource conservation. The EPA has since the late 1980s adopted
environmental impact assessment as a management tool to screen undertakings likely to pose
adverse impact on the environment. Environmental screening and assessments became legal
requirements in 1999 with the promulgation of the Environmental Assessment Regulations
(Legislative Instrument 1652) and Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are applied to
most development projects. Procedures have been established to screen and evaluate all
development projects and programs that may have significant social and environmental
impacts. Under the country's Environmental Assessment Regulations (Legislative Instrument
1652), an EIA is mandatory for seventeen types of activities classified as critical. These
activities include: (i) mining; (ii) petroleum and gas field development and exploration; (iii)
construction of dams, harbors and roads; and (iv) logging and disposal of timber.

133. Sustainable management of Ghana's water and land resources is a critical factor
in sustained agricultural growth. The recognition of this is implicit in various national and
sector policies, strategies and action plans, including the National Environmental Action Plan
(NEAP), the Soil Fertility Management Plan, the National Wildlife Policy, the Water Policy
and the National Irrigation Policy. The National Action Program to Combat Drought and
Desertification (NAP) provides a long-term strategy to address land degradation in affected
areas in Ghana. Sustainable natural resource management is an essential component of the
prevailing policy frameworks, including GSGDA, FASDEP II and NEPAD's CAADP. The
development of a Sustainable Agricultural Land Management Strategy is included in the
FASDEP II as an important tool to implement the policy provisions of the Land Policy and
provide an opportunity to better integrate sustainable land management into the existing
policy frameworks. Equally important, the formulation of a Country Investment Framework
for SLM (CSIF) (a benchmark under the NREG DPO) would be an important tool to facilitate
dialogue and inter-ministerial planning around the cross-cutting issue of land degradation.
These are necessary to inform the goal, objectives and policy actions to facilitate increased
attention paid to sustainable land management in Ghana.

              C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

134. The AgDPO4 will continue to apply the good practice principles of conditionality
(Box 2). MoFEP and MoFA will be responsible for implementing this operation on behalf of

                                               50
the Government. IDA will make the credit proceeds available to the Borrower upon: (i)
maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic policy framework; (ii) implementation of the
overall program in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; and (iii) completion of policy and
institutional actions as set forth in this Program Document.

135. Bank supervision will continue to be aligned with the activities of other donors, in
particular with CIDA, and with the joint sector monitoring activities. It will also be aligned
the implementation of the policies being supported by the EGPRS/PRSC/MDBS. MoFEP
would be responsible for the overall implementation of the proposed budget support, together
with MoFA.

                          Box 2: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The Government of Ghana developed FASDEP II, on the basis of which the previous AgDPO series was agreed
to, and which continues to form the foundation for consultations on issues and challenges of promoting growth
and poverty reduction through agriculture. Ownership is strengthened through implementing the CAADP agenda
at the national level, evidenced by the Round Table, the signing of the Compact in October 2009 by all sector
stakeholders, and the development of the CAADP investment plan, METASIP, in 2010. The AgDPO is
structured explicitly as the Bank‟s instrument for supporting CAADP and METASIP implementation, further
reinforcing national ownership.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
The AgDPO is part of a concerted effort with DPs grouped around the FASDEP II and the sector investment
plan. The AgDPO aims at reducing the Government‟s transaction costs in dealing with development assistance
by ensuring that the support is geared towards the sector strategy and investment plan. Mutual accountability is
strengthened by the MoFA-DPs Joint Sector Review as the forum for reaching consensus on sector performance
and priority measures moving forward.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The proposed operation will continue to increase the share of aid provided through general budget support while
helping to deepen sector level policy dialogue. Supporting the national policy and sector plan within the CAADP
framework diversifies accountability from a project-specific framework to one based upon progress in achieving
CAADP objectives. Notwithstanding current macroeconomic challenges, Ghana continues to be well placed to
adopt budget support instruments. By closing the previous series and starting this new series, the Bank is
responding strategically to changing political environment and emerging policy agendas.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The number of critical actions in the policy matrix for AgDPO4 being supported by this operation is less than 10.
These were selected jointly by GoG for their importance in achieving sector objectives, and in order to
demonstrate the importance attached to these reforms within GoG. The policy matrix for the current operation
reflects previous advice to continue to streamline and strengthen prior actions to strategic critical measures.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
The AgDPO series is being aligned with the MoFA-DPs annual sector review process, which will monitor
CAADP implementation, and will be harmonized with the performance assessment of CIDA‟s budgetary
support. The reviews will also draw on the MDBS/EGPRC assessments and will be aligned as far as possible
with the timetables of these assessments.


136. The actions to be monitored under the operation are extracted from government
policy and program documents (e.g., METASIP, FASDEP II, the FY2011 budget
statement, and the sector M&E matrix), ensuring this alignment and reducing the transaction

                                                       51
costs of managing budgetary support for the government. Reporting arrangements will
continue as laid out in AgDPO 1. During the period of implementation of the program
supported by the proposed DPO, supervision would draw on sector monitoring and evaluation
reports.

                        Table 9. DPO Reporting and Responsibility Assignment
                                       Reporting                                         Responsibility
Quarterly reports on budget expenditures with breakdown by Ministry, Department and      GoG (from PRSC)
Agency with a lag of no more that 6 weeks after the end of each quarter. These reports
will also present the breakdown for Items 1 - 4 of the national budget.
Quarterly reports on domestically financed poverty-related (including HIPC financed      GoG (from PRSC)
expenditures), with a lag of no more that 6 weeks after the end of each quarter. These
reports would include a breakdown along main poverty-related expenditure programs
and a breakdown for Items 1 – 4 of the national budget (personnel, administration,
services, and investment).
Annual Progress Report on progress on the implementation of the GSGDA                    GoG
Quarterly and Annual Sector Progress Reports (MoFA)                                      GoG

137. The Bank, with partners, will continue to support dialogue on critical policy
issues. The Bank is currently the Deputy Co-Chair of the Agriculture Sector Working Group
(with USAID as full Co-Chair with MoFA), and will be the full Co-Chair (with MoFA) of the
group starting August 2012.

138. The sector monitoring framework will continue to serve as the basis for
monitoring sector performance and therefore the results of this operation. The objectives
and targets in the proposed DPO series are aligned with the monitoring framework and are
consistent with FASDEP II objectives and METASIP program components. There are
systemic concerns over the accuracy of agricultural statistics which feed the M&E system.
IFPRI is helping Government determine areas for improvement in the collection of key
agricultural data, and it is expected that the Bank‟s proposed assistance to the national
statistical capability under the Ghana Statistics Development Program will incorporate a
capacity building component. The Ghana living standards survey is to be conducted in 2012,
and data will not be available until 2013. However, other household surveys are underway,
such as an agricultural household survey by the Government, assisted by IFPRI, and a survey
by the Growth Center which may at a minimum provide some generic observations about the
poverty impact of the program, if not before AgDPO5, then as part of the ICR of this series.

139. The results framework for the second AgDPO series utilizes the existing MoFA
M&E framework, but it also draws on information from decentralized MDA units and
the private sector. The baselines and the targets in the results framework have been updated
using the recently released 2010 data that will serve as the baseline as at April 2011.
Compared to the Results Framework presented in AgDPO3, minor changes have been made
to some indicators, reflecting lessons learned from the recently completed ICR of AgDPO1
and 2, and/or reflecting the available information. Footnotes to that effect have been included
in the Results Framework. In order to better reflect the specific policy objectives and
indicators, the overall PDO has been rephrased as follows: The program development
objective is to enhance productivity and market access among farmers, and to improve
agriculture sector management.

          This indicator will be measured in Ghana Cedis to reflect local conditions and should be evaluated in conjunction with the US$ export value and export volumes.
       49
          Given that the agriculture sector is declining as a proportion of total GDP but is growing in absolute terms, reflecting the process of structural transformation of the
       economy, this indicator will be measured in absolute terms, not as a proportion of total lending.

                                  D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

140. The second AgDPO series is designed, inter alia, to enhance sector governance.
Agriculture spending is not well defined and resource allocation to MoFA is heavily skewed
towards personal emoluments and administration rather than investment and services.
However, with the finalization of METASIP, Government has committed to increasing its
resource allocation to investment and services, but this requires improved sector-wide
coordination and financial management. This process is supported by a sector-wide Bank-
administered PER, followed by the design of a methodology that will define and identify
agriculture expenditure to improve budgeting and tracking that is needed for the
implementation of METASIP. In addition, the program supported by the DPO specifically
encourages increased private sector participation and enhanced transparency and accountability
in programs such as the fertilizer subsidy program. Furthermore, the promotion of PPPs and,
more generally, private investment in line with the Principles for Responsible Agricultural
Investments as developed by the Bank and other DPs are expected to generate demand for
further transparency and accountability. Support will be provided to the Government by the
Bank to resolve governance issues in the fisheries sector, notably by introducing enforcement
of regulations by third party operators.

141. Public financial management is solid enough to warrant the continuation of
Development Policy Operations. Analytical work undertaken by DPs in collaboration with the
Government highlighted the strong foundation being built towards strengthening PFM in
Ghana. PEFA 2010 and the ERPFM 2010 reports, as well as the IMF FAD report of 2010
confirm that Ghana has built a solid legal and regulatory framework and foundation for public
financial management that performs at an average level and occasionally above-average
standards, see updated summary in box below. Timeliness in financial reporting, despite
weaknesses in comprehensiveness and gaps in account reconciliation, has improved markedly,
and so were the quality and effectiveness of external audit, and its compliance with
international standards as well as coverage. A strong Parliamentary Public Accounts
Committee, reinvigorated since 2009, is currently in place and its proceedings are open to the
public and on both print media and television. A further strengthening of this legislative
oversight role, including a more systematic and aggressive follow up on audit findings, will
support the entrenchment of accountability and transparency within the public financial
management realm and in service delivery efficiency and effectiveness as a whole. Reform
successes in the area of public procurement are also quite encouraging as revealed by the
PPA‟s use of the Public Procurement Model of Excellence as a self-assessment tool. As against
a target of 80 percent set by EGPRC/MDBS for assessment of performance of high spending
entities in public procurement in 2008, actual performance realized were 97.6 percent, 95.2
percent, and 81.6 percent respectively for (a) use of appropriate procurement methods; (b)
publication of tender notices; and (c) publication of award of contracts. A lot more remains to
be done in the area of improving public procurement systems, however. Using the results of an
analysis by the Bank, with the application of the OECD-DAC assessment tool, it has been
concluded that Ghana still needs to further improve the efficiency of the national procurement
systems by strengthening the legislative framework, enhancing institutional development
capacity, streamlining operations, and increasing transparency.

142. But fiduciary issues remain in terms of budget execution. The implementation of an
effective cash management system, the treasury single account, and the full reinstatement of
commitment controls in all MDAs, will lower the risk of expenditure slippages and support the
                                              57
predictability of resource flows to MDAs as well as reduce the potentials for expenditure
arrears. The planned transfer of subvented agencies‟ payroll to the computerized human
resource management system (IPPD-2) will also allow closer monitoring of the public sector
size and improved payroll management and also the internal controls associated with it.
Improvements in account reconciliations will equally enhance the credibility and reliability of
the government financial statements.

143. Upgrading, stabilizing, and fully rolling-out of the Ghana Integrated Financial
Management Information System (GIFMIS) for budget management is critical to
sustaining success in both the maintenance of fiscal discipline and the effective and timely
monitoring of overall government finances. To this end, the Government has initiated and
approved a new PFM Improvement (Reforms) Charter – called the GIFMIS Charter – that
outlines the framework that the government has adopted, and seeks to implement on a priority
basis, aimed at reversing the key inherent weaknesses in its fiduciary control environment. The
Charter, whose implementation has now commenced through the GIFMIS project, and has the
full government ownership and unflinching commitment at the highest level in government,
will address the key challenges involved in the budgeting, accounting, and reporting systems,
processes, and practices across government. At present, the government has adopted a new
harmonized GFS 2001-compliant chart of accounts for budgeting, accounting, and reporting.
This new chart formed the basis for the preparation of the central government budget for 2012.
Also, with the complete set-up of the general ledger and the „pay-to procure‟ sub-modules of
the Oracle Financials version 12 as the first step in the measured implementation of the
GIFMIS, the path towards more reliable, accurate, and comprehensive financial reporting is
beginning to show results. As part of the government strategy for improved financial
management, significant reforms (including improvements in payroll management, program-
based budgeting, financial reporting under the International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (IPSAS) are now being embedded in the design and implementation of the GIFMIS.
In addition, to support improved cash management, the CAGD has implemented a form of
„treasury realignment‟ that provides for integrating the treasuries as part of the administrative
control of MDAs and MMDAs, while retaining the recruitment and posting powers of the core
accounting staff.

144. The IMF conducted a safeguards assessment of the Bank of Ghana in 2009. Under
the Fund‟s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Ghana (BoG) has been subject to an
update assessment with respect to a new PRGF arrangement approved on July 15 2009; the
assessment, completed on December 2, 2009, followed an initial safeguards assessment from
October 2003. The update assessment found that while the safeguards framework of the BoG
has been strengthened in several areas since then, new risks in governance oversight emerged
with the removal of the former Board in January 2009, and a delay, due to a legal challenge, in
the start of the successor Board. Pending the resumption of Board activities, some interim
measures have been introduced to provide an independent oversight mechanism. These include
the introduction of an Advisory Panel comprised of three outside members responsible for the
external and internal audit and controls systems. In March 2010, however, the authorities have
advised staff that a new Board has been appointed. They have also either committed to or
implemented all measures proposed by staff.

145. Overall fiduciary environment: Given the positive PFM improvements, overtime,
amid government‟s unflinching commitment to reforms as exemplified by its adoption and
commencement of implementation of a Government-led PFM Reforms Charter (GIFMIS), and

                                               58
as the latest IMF Safeguards Assessment indicates that Ghana has implemented or is in the
course of implementing the necessary reforms at the BoG, the overall fiduciary risk of the
operation is rated „moderate‟.

                            Box 3: Ghana’s Public Financial Management Systems
Credibility of the Budget. Actual primary expenditure compared with budgeted expenditure shows significant deviations at
both the aggregate level and at the level of individual Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Aggregate deviation for
2009 was a high of 12.5 percent, but this improved to a low of 0.4 percent in 2010 as prior arrears were appropriated during
2010, thus impacting on deviations that would have been magnified had those arrears been settled within the fiscal year through
extra-budgetary spending. With a reduction in expenditure arrears brought about by improved expenditure management in 2010
relative to 2009, the expenditure compositional variance for 2010 reduced to 15.1 percent compared to 22.8 percent in 2009.
One of the root causes of weak budget credibility had been the weak expenditure planning and failure to recognize and fully
budget year-end commitments in subsequent year‟s budgets as well as the largely ineffective establishment controls.
Notwithstanding, the improved realism in revenue budgeting was however reported to have cushioned the impact of reduced
overall budget credibility.
Comprehensiveness and Transparency of the Budget. While the budget documentation is fairly complete, comprehensible
and comprehensive, and is made publicly available, the budget classification system was, up to 2009, not yet fully GFS
compliant and was incapable of directly supporting a functional outcome budget management process. This is notwithstanding
the fact that the categorization of the administrative classification elements allows some linkage to the National Development
Strategic Framework. Transparency of inter-governmental fiscal relations also requires improvement. The GFS 2001-compliant
budget classification structure, harmonized for central government, has now been adopted, and implementation started with the
preparation of the budget for 2012,
Policy-based Budget. While budgets have become more policy-based in recent years – in as much as the approaches instituted
remain severely constrained – Ghana‟s performance is held back by limited ability to cost strategies, the lack of effective wage
bill planning, the absence of a transparent link between planned and executed budget activities, and the lack of an effective
feedback mechanism. The underlying institutional arrangements to support a policy-based budget process are absent despite the
adoption of a single stage coordinated budget process for recurrent and development budgets. In spite of the underlying
weaknesses in its implementation experience, the Government has adopted a three-year Medium Term Expenditure Framework
for its budgetary processes. Going forward, the government has committed itself to implementing a program-based budgeting
framework. Pilot implementation of the program-based budgeting in three MDAs has started with the 2011 budget, and this is
being extended to some seven more in 2012.
Predictability and Control in Budget Execution. While Ghana‟s central government scores well overall with respect to some
aspects of revenue administration, debt management, payroll management and procurement, overall predictability and control
in budget execution remains an area of concern. The areas of concern include the discretionary elements of the legal and
regulatory framework for revenue management, the controls in the taxpayer registration system, the predictability in the
availability of funds for the commitment of expenditures, the extent of consolidation of the government‟s bank cash balances,
the effectiveness of the establishment control, and the effectiveness of the commitment control. Cash management remains a
particular challenge to the PFM systems as well as the apparent lack of effective procurement planning as part of the budget
process. Although the legal and regulatory framework is clear on the controls for each of the main steps of the procurement and
expenditure cycle, these are not applied uniformly across all MDAs. The internal audit units are well structured although their
focus continues to include pre-audit functions as well – a factor that undermines their independence.
Accounting, Recording and Reporting. Within 4 – 6 weeks after each month-end, the CAGD-managed bank accounts are
reconciled, following clear guidelines and procedures contained in the Accounting Manual. For the other government accounts,
the retained IGF bank accounts, statutory funds, and those related to development partner funded projects, these remain outside
this arrangement. The retained IGF accounts are reconciled quarterly in some ministries but at least annually for all in the
preparation of the final accounts. Suspense accounts are also reconciled and cleared, but annually, as part of the year-end
closing of accounts. Data integrity however remains a source of concern, especially in the absence of full consolidation of all
government fund types. The monthly financial statements produced, within 4 – 6 weeks after month-end, do not report on
expenditure at the time of commitment but only when actual expenditures have been made. This form of presentation permits
only a partial (non-consolidated) comparison of revenues and expenditures to the original budget appropriations. Timeless in
preparing the Public Accounts (Consolidated Fund) is achieved as they are submitted within 3 months of end of fiscal year, and
the accounts are largely consistent with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) cash basis of financial
reporting. Accounting, recording, and reporting are predominantly paper-based but this is changing with the implementation of
the GIFMIS already achieving milestones.
External Scrutiny and Audit. Submission of audit reports to the legislature is now timely – within 3 months and 6 to 9
months after receipt of draft accounts for the consolidated fund and the MDAs‟ accounts respectively. The scope and nature of
audits performed is satisfactory, although much of risk-based focus is required despite audits being largely compliant with
international standards. Effective follow up on audit reports is only just beginning. With procedures for review of budget
documentation by the legislature being firmly established and respected in terms of available review time, the scope of the
scrutiny as well as the failure in respecting the rules for in-year budget adjustments hampers performance against this PFM
dimension. Examination and completion of reviews of audit reports by the Public Accounts Committee remain untimely
notwithstanding the presence of a more aggressive parliamentary public accounts committee.


                                                              59
                            E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

146. Recipient and Financing Agreement. This proposed operation is a one-tranche IDA
credit of SDR 32.3 million (US$50 million equivalent). The credit disbursement will follow
the standard Bank procedures for Development Policy Lending. The administration of this
credit will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.

147. Funds flow arrangements. The Government of Ghana shall identify a Foreign
Exchange Account with the Bank of Ghana and which forms part of the country‟s official
foreign exchange reserves, into which the proceeds of the credit will be disbursed upon meeting
the agreed prior actions and upon credit effectiveness. The Ghana Cedi equivalent of the funds
in the Account will, within two working days, be transferred into the Consolidated Fund of the
Government of Ghana, and the amount recorded appropriately in the financial management
system of the Government of Ghana.

148. Disbursements from the Consolidated Fund by the Government of Ghana shall not
be tied to any specific purchases and no special procurement requirement shall be needed.
The proceeds of the credit shall, however, not be applied to finance expenditures in the
negative list as defined in the Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement. If any portion of the
credit is used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule 1 of the Financing
Agreement, IDA shall require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA, refund an
amount equal to the amount of the said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such
request shall be cancelled from the credit.

149. Assurance Requirements. Based on the moderate fiduciary risk associated with the
operation, there will be no special fiduciary arrangements established for the credit in terms of
a requirement for an audit. However, within seven days of the disbursement of the credit by
IDA, the Chief Director of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning Ghana shall
provide a written confirmation to IDA, certifying the receipt of the Ghana Cedi equivalent of
the credit into the Consolidated Fund Account of the Government of Ghana, the number of the
account, the date of the receipt, and the exchange rate applied to translate the credit currency
into Ghana Cedi, and confirming that the said amount has been appropriately accounted for in
the recipient‟s financial management system. In addition, as the Controller and Auditor
General Department is required by law to submit its annual report and the audited accounts on
the public consolidated fund to Parliament within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year, a copy
of the said reports and accounts shall be provided to IDA within one month after the lapse of
the 6 month period. The Government shall equally ensure that the annual entity financial
statements of the Bank of Ghana (BoG), audited in accordance with international standards on
auditing as promulgated by the International Federation of Accountants, are publicly available.

150. Nevertheless, the Association reserves the right to request, at any time, an audit of
the receipt and accounting of the disbursement in the budget management system of the
Borrower. Upon the Association‟s request, the Borrower shall: (i) have the account and the
recording of amounts of the credit into the Borrower‟s budget management system audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association, in accordance with consistently applied
auditing standards acceptable to the Association; (ii) furnish to the Association as soon as
available, but in any case no later than four months after the date of the Association‟s request
for such audit, a certified copy of the audit report by said auditors, of such scope and in such
detail as the Association shall have reasonably requested; and (iii) furnish to the Association

                                               60
such other information concerning the said account and recording of credit amounts into the
budget management system, and the audit thereof, as the Association shall have reasonably
requested.

                             F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

151. A departure from the prevailing agriculture policy underpinning the AgDPO
series may be a potential risk. The Government has endorsed CAADP, has committed to
spending 10 percent of its budget on the agriculture sector by signing the Africa Union Maputo
Declaration in 2003, has confirmed the sector investment plan, METASIP, and has thus
reaffirmed its commitment to achieving private sector-led, Government-facilitated agriculture
sector growth. However, Government is operating a number of programs that are characterized
by direct interventions in markets that could otherwise be developed and operated by the
private sector, such as the fertilizer subsidy program and the block farm program linked to food
buffer stock operations. With the dual objective of developing a private sector-led agriculture
sector and to reduce the risk of policy inconsistency, the DPO will assist the Government to
remain consistent in its policies and programs by further developing these programs to become
financially and otherwise sustainable by including the private sector and adopting market
principles. The fertilizer subsidy program has undergone positive changes in 2010 and has
improved further with support already provided under the DPO. Newly introduced program-
based budgeting combined with the planned TA in support of METASIP planning will
strengthen the METASIP governance and accountability structures. In addition to the Bank‟s
support, the Agriculture Sector Working Group and its Joint Sector Review, and the multi-
stakeholder METASIP Steering Committee with its policy dialogue function and SAKSS
capability will make important contributions towards mitigating the risk of policy
inconsistency.

152. Political risks associated with the upcoming elections as they apply to the
agriculture sector are largely mitigated by this very AgDPO series, which enables the
Ministry of Food and Agriculture to continue the implementation of various reforms in a
consistent manner. For example, efforts under the DPO to put in place a methodology to
correctly account for public expenditures in the agriculture sector across ministries improves
transparency of the sector budget, thereby possibly hampering political pressures to replace
METASIP-related spending with spending that is politically motivated. In addition, the
existence of a strong sector working group combined with strong overall donor coordination
will mitigate political risk. This is the second election to take place during an AgDPO series
(the previous election saw a change of administration) and there is an existing record of
continuity across the political cycle.

153. Investor out-grower arrangements as implemented under the Commercial
Agriculture Project may present risks associated with a lack of land tenure security
(affecting investors) and a lack of benefit sharing through elite capture and exploitation
(affecting rural communities). These risks are mitigated by the development of a framework
that supports the establishment of arrangements between investors and out-growers by, among
others, facilitating land audits and developing a “model lease agreement? that sets out benefit
sharing arrangements and mutual accountability standards, following the Principles of
Responsible Agricultural Investment.



                                              61
154. Ghana’s exposure to climate change is a risk that is managed by implementing the
mitigation strategy of the WB/Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDRR). Ghana is one of the 20 WB/GFDDR priority countries and a comprehensive
Disaster Risk Management Country Program is being implemented by the Government.
Coordination is required to ensure that the policy objectives supported under the AgDPO are
supportive of the Disaster Risk Management Country Program.

155. Weaknesses in PFM undermine the effectiveness of Government spending and risk
weakening the expected outcomes from sector-focused development policy lending. This is
a risk across all MDAs and is being effectively mitigated by substantial support to roll-out
improved financial management systems that embed the requisite reforms. Annual ERPFMs
provide updated diagnostics and recommended priority reforms are incorporated in the MDBS
policy framework. At the sector level, risks are mitigated through MoFA-specific diagnostics
(i.e. the Bank-administered NEPAD support to CAADP budget implementation, including a
sector-wide PER and the development of a methodology that identifies, budgets, and tracks
sector-wide agriculture expenditure, and measures impact), measures to restore and improve
oversight systems (e.g. the various budget and procurement committees, as called for under the
CIDA budget support) and ongoing technical assistance to the MoFA Financial Controller‟s
Office from the Government of Japan.

156. Political feasibility risks related to the fiscal adjustment (opposition to increased
tariffs and taxes, large wage bill increases, and demand for new investment programs
financed with current and future oil revenues) with new elections looming, which could
re-ignite inflation, impair debt sustainability and further increase banks’ vulnerabilities.
The proposed PRSG8 programmatic operation will mitigate some of these risks of fiscal
slippages by supporting actions that prevent further public expenditure arrears accumulation,
strengthen cost-recovery mechanisms in utilities, and implement the second financial sector
strategic plan for greater financial stability. Risks are also mitigated by demand for good
governance activities supported by the World Bank, as well as the centralization of the public
wage negotiations scheme through the adoption of the Single Spine Salary Structure.

157. External risks associated with a deteriorated global economic environment,
affecting Ghana’s terms of trade, remittances and official development assistance from
OECD countries. Better initial conditions (high foreign currency reserves, low public
financing needs, stable inflation expectations), oil-related stabilization mechanisms (hedging
scheme, stabilization fund), would reduce the impact of external shocks on the domestic
economy and balance of payments.

158. The potential benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the residual risks and
warrant assistance for implementing critical reforms and policy actions in a coordinated fashion
with other donors, while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize the sustainability of the
reform agenda.

 FOURTH AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION !AgDP04)
        LETTER OF AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY

Introduction

This is the fourth Deve lopment Policy Operation for the Agricu lture Sector since the
World Bank and the Government of Ghana introduced a series of development policy
operations for the agriculture sector in 2008 to support the implementation of the Food and
Agriculture Sector Development Policy of the Government of Ghana. Following the
development of the Med ium Term Agriculture Investment Plan (METASIP) as part of the
CAADP Compact for Ghana, consistent with the Ghana Shared Growth and Development
Agenda (GSGDA), the Bank abrogated the first series of operations which began in 2008
after two disbursements of $25 million each year and started a new series in 20 II,
doubling the size to $50millon annually.

The Government views the increased funding to the agriculture sector as a commitment by
the World Bank and other deve lopment partners to its agricultural modernization agenda
aimed at increasing food security and reducing poverty in the face of a new oil economy.
The scaled fund ing is a significant contribution to the estimated annual budget of GH¢306
mill ion required for the funding of METASIP. For 2012 fo r example, GH¢262.2 mi llion
has been all ocated to MoF A, AgDP04 contributing 19%.

Ghana continues to post strong economic growth in the face of global slow-down. Whilst
an average growth rate of 2% was recorded for sub-saharan Africa, Ghana experienced a
growth of 5% and is projected to grow at 9.4% in 2012, one of the region' s fastest growing
economies. To sustain this growth, government continues to intensify its interventions and
to strengthen its institutions and policy dialogue for effective implementation of
programmes and decision making.




                                                   64
Key interventions continue to be in line with the major objectives in the FASDEP and
expressed in the six major programmes of the METASIP.

Food security and emergency preparedness - with interventions focusing on productivity
of staple crops, irrigation, nutrition, post harvest management and marketing;

Improved growth ill incomes and reduced income variability - focusing on income
diversification activities and using the value chain approach to promote commodities with
market potential

Sustainable management of land and environment - with programmes aimed at building
institutional capacity for sustainable land management and protection of the
environmental ..

Increasell competitiveness and enhanced integratioll illto domestic and international
markets - with programmes aimed at strenb'lhening private sector linkages with
smallholder farmers and enhancing domestic and international trading opportunities.

Science and technology applied in food and agriculture development - with emphasis on
application of research and technology along the value chain to transform the agriculture
sector.

Institutional Coordination Enhanced - expected outcomes being improved partnership
and harmonisation of efforts for efficiency and effectiveness.

Some of the major programmes funded in the sector with the additional contribution of the
policy operations include:

Support for increased use of fertilizer and seed, increased mechanization to remove delays
in land preparation time and drudgery, youth employment in agriculture through block
farms and the National Buffer Stock operations mainly aimed at reducing price instability
for farmers and consumers for key staple commodities as well as providing a market for
fanners. An assessment of the effects of these interventions by a joint research team made
up of the Ghana institute of Management and Public Administration consultancy Centre
and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) shows some positive results
in the areas of increased fertilizer lise, improved use of tractors and price stabilization of
maize of the two years.

The completion report of the first and second agriculture development policy operations
also shows a number of positive outcomes in the agriculture sector. For many key food
crops agricultural productivity and production have increased substantially, particularly in
the northern part of the country. Despite the economic crisis in Ghana's markets, Ghana
has been able to maintain its level of agricultural non-trad itional exports. Although credit
remains a constraint, the volume of agricultural lending has increased substantially during
recent years. Government will continue to develop its policies and programmes, taking into
consideration the results and lessons learned from the various reviews. Government will




                                             65
also intensify engagement with the private sector through other support programmes
supported by the World Bank, such as the Ghana Commercial Agriculture Project using
the Public-Private-Patnership framework, and through collaboration with other
development partners. There is room to improve on institutional capacity building and
policy dialogue to support and sustain the effective implementation of the agriculture
sector programmes to yield the desired results of enhanced food security and increased
rural incomes.

The AgDPO Policy Agenda

The fourth Agriculture Development Policy Operation is the second in the series and will
continue to support the same policy objectives as the previous operation. These objectives
are derived from METASIP to which the policy agenda and respective actions will
contribute. The policy action areas supported by the Operation are discussed below.

Agricultural technology for improved on-farm productivity: It is generally agreed that the
full complement of inputs is required to generate the accelerated productivity that is
needed to farm incomes and the same time make food available at reduced cost. In
addition to the fertilizer subsidy started in 2008, the Government is going to support the
development and production of improved seed and subsidize its sale to promote its use in
2012 and beyond.

Government through the approval of the Science and Technology Policy and Action Plan
pledges among other things to improve research to support the implementation and funding
of its programmes. The establishment of the Councils under the Plant and Fertilizer Act
will provide enhanced policy environment for effective use of agricultural inputs to
promote agriculture productivity.

The Ministry will continue to collaborate with the Ministry of Environment, Science and
Technology through their agriculture research institutes and under the Research Extension
Liaison Committees to generate the demand driven technologies for promoting agriculture
development.

Market (lml value chaill developmellt: This policy priority continues to be critical with
emphasis on strengthening potentially profitable value chains. Apart from Govenunent's
own programmes such as the block farm programme and the national buffer stock
operations, there arc several other interventions through donor projects that promote value
chain development. These include the Northern Rural Growth Programme in the three
Northern regions, the Market Oriented Agriculture Programme focusing on horticulture
exports and the Agriculture Development and Value Chain Enhancement (ADVANCE)
Project. The Ghana Commercial Agriculture Programme (GCAP) in the pipeline will
provide the opportunity to promote and develop socially inclusive commodity value
chains. The ongoing work on Warehouse Receipt System and the establishment of a
Commodity Exchange will add value to the efforts at improving commodity marketing.
The adaptation of the Export Development and Investment Fund to include a fund




                                            66
dedicated to agribusiness development has been completed and is expected to contribute to
the above interventions.


Irrigation and other infrastructure: Irrigation development wiII promote increased
productivity and reduce the risk in weather dependent agriculture. A pre-investment
framework that outlines the development of irrigation infrastructure and institutional
structure, consistent with the irrigation policy, is developed to guide investments in the
sub-sector. It will also include measures aimed at organizing the users to efficiently
manage the infrastructure

Fisheries: To sustain the fishery resource and improve governance of the fishery sub-
sector, Government has suspended the licensing of new fishing vessels. An audit of
existing vessels is being carried out to inform better management and control of fishing.
The Ghana Fisheries Project, funded by the World Bank, has been approved and will
support the implementation of the new fisheries sector development plan.

Agriculture sector management: It is important that agriculture expenditure is defined,
captured and tracked. This will inform decision making and accountability for results. A
methodology is being designed to identify agriculture expenditures the programs under
METASI.P across various government ministries and agencies, thus enabling the
comprehensive budgeting, tracking and evaluation of agriculture expenditure.

Request for World Bank Support

To support the above policy and institutional actions for the effective implementation of
the METASIP, The Ministry of Food and Agriculture is requesting the World Bank to
approve the fourth Agriculture Development Policy Operation and disburse Fifty Million
Dollars ($50 million) under the Development Policy redit facility.

                             The Acting Chair’s Summing Up
       Ghana—Fifth Review Under the Three-Year Arrangement Under the Extended
           Credit Facility and Request for Modification of Performance Criteria
                              Executive Board Meeting 11/121
                                    December 14, 2011

         Executive Directors commended the authorities‟ performance and the significant
economic progress made under their ECF-supported program. Growth has been strong, fiscal and
external current account imbalances have been reduced, inflation has moderated, and the
international reserves position has strengthened. Directors emphasized that prudent policies and
ongoing progress in structural reforms will be essential to preserve macroeconomic and financial
stability gains and spur private-sector led growth.

        Directors stressed the importance of continued efforts to create fiscal space for high
priority investments. They welcomed the authorities‟ commitment to strengthen public finances
through increased revenue mobilization and prudent expenditure management. Directors noted
that the 2012 budget is consistent with progress in these areas, but stressed the need for careful
management of the wage bill. They looked forward to the timely implementation of the new
VAT bill and further strengthening of public financial management, including migration to a
treasury single account. They encouraged steadfast implementation of the provisions of the
Petroleum Revenue Management Act.

        Directors acknowledged the need for Ghana to rely increasingly on nonconcessional
financing to address its growth-critical infrastructure requirements. While noting that the debt
sustainability analysis suggests scope for such borrowing, and that some of the planned projects
promise significant returns, they stressed the importance of strengthening debt management and
project appraisal capacities to maximize investment returns and contain future risks of debt
distress. In addition to addressing the gaps in physical infrastructure, structural reforms to
improve the business climate will also be important to achieve the authorities‟ growth and
development objectives.

        Directors highlighted the need to tackle the reemergence of subsidies on petroleum
products. They called for timely and effective adjustment of petroleum prices to cost-recovery
levels, while mitigating the impact on the poor through targeted transfers and safety nets.

        Directors commended the authorities for achieving their inflation target, and welcomed
the Bank of Ghana‟s readiness to adjust policy rates should upside risks to inflation become
acute. In view of considerable volatility in the foreign exchange market, Directors encouraged
the Bank of Ghana to further refine, and better communicate, its policies and instruments for
foreign exchange market interventions.

        Directors emphasized the importance of continuing financial sector reforms. They looked
forward to further progress by the Bank of Ghana on strengthening banks‟ risk management,
resolving vulnerable institutions and enhancing its supervisory capacity. Directors urged the
authorities to address the deficiencies in the AML/CFT regime.
