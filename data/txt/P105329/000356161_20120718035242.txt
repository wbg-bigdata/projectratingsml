1. Context, Project Development Objectives, and Design

Country and sector background

The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)—comprising Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand,
Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, and the Yunnan province of China, spread over 2.3 million
square kilometers—houses a population of about 260 million. Despite a large endowment of
energy resources, the region’s per capita consumption of electricity in 2004 was low—ranging
from about only 63 kWh per year in Cambodia to about 1,900 kWh per year in Thailand. The six
GMS member countries have been largely characterized by national electricity demands that do
not match with their national electricity producing resources. For example, Laos’s electricity
supply (potential) exceeded domestic demand, while Cambodia’ demand for power exceeded
domestic generation capacity and electricity cost was one of highest in the region, thereby
creating opportunities for power trade. To address the rapid demand growth and concerns on
energy security, the GMS countries decided to enhance regional cooperation in the power sector,
to strengthen regional transmission networks, to promote cross-border investments in energy
resources, and to develop a regional electricity market in a phased manner.

GMS Regional Power Trade. A GMS Forum was established in early 1990s with the support of
the Asian Development Bank (ADB). This was followed by the signing of several memoranda of
understanding between and among the countries for power trade. The GMS countries signed an
Intergovernmental Agreement on Regional Power Trade (IGA) in 2002, which was ratified by
their respective law-making bodies between 2004 and 2005. While a competitive electricity
market was a long-term objective, there was consensus among the countries that it was important
to develop an appropriate framework for strengthening trade and to start increasing the regional
transmission interconnections and generation capacity. The institutional framework set up to
implement the GMS objectives comprised the following:

       The Ministerial Council on Economic Cooperation in the GMS—the highest level
        forum of the GMS process;
       The Energy Minister’s Council, providing strategic advice and policy guidance;
       The Regional Power Trade Coordinating Committee (RPTCC), as the highest level
        body responsible for coordinating the regional electricity market’s development;
       The Focal Group (FG), for the planning and operation of regional power
        interconnections; and
       The Planning Working Group (PWG), whose members were responsible for cross-
        border transmission system planning and operational standards.

Cambodia was proposing to import power from Lao PDR and Viet Nam (instead of using local
diesel-fired generators) to supply two of its provinces: Kampong Cham and Stung Treng. The
approved IDA Grants to Cambodia and Lao PDR (H3010 and H3000, respectively) were to
finance inter alia these cross-border interconnections. All three countries were to be assisted by
IDA in this initiative: the Cambodia and Lao PDR projects were financed through the approved
IDA Grants while the already approved System Efficiency Improvement, Equitization and
Renewables Project (SEIER, US$225 million, FY 2002, Cr. 3680-VN) was to be used to finance
that country’s portion of the Vietnam-Cambodia transmission line to the Cambodian border.

Rationale for Bank assistance

Momentum for regional economic integration and, in particular, integration of electricity systems
among the countries in the GMS region had been growing steadily. The ADB, World Bank, and
other development partners had been actively fostering a coordinated approach toward
developing the GMS countries’ resources. The Bank’s strategy was articulated in the “Strategy
Note on Economic Cooperation across the Mekong Sub-Region? dated April 2007. It provided
support to develop frameworks for joint action including implementation through analytical work,
technical assistance, capacity building, dialogue, and investment. It also helped to ensure that the
plans proposed and implemented at the regional level complemented and reinforced country level
activities and programs. The Bank’s GMS regional assistance strategy included: (i) continued
support to the development of power trade, and (ii) enhanced collaboration on Mekong water
resource management.

The Bank, with its unique experience with power markets in other regions (Southeast Europe and
Africa), was well positioned to bring its experience to the GMS. It had been an active participant
in RPTCC meetings and had worked intensively in shaping the RPTCC’s agenda. At a Bank
workshop on international experiences in June 2006, the participants expressed a keen desire for
the Bank to deepen its involvement in the GMS.

By financing priority regional transmission interconnections, it was expected that these projects
would help clients in “learning by doing? to develop modalities for designing, financing, and
constructing cross-border transmission links for strengthening electricity trade between electricity
systems and power utilities—the first step toward developing a regional market.

Project description and costs

The project development objective was defined in the PAD as follows: “to enhance power trade
within the Greater Mekong Sub-Region with a view to bringing affordable grid-based electricity
to selected provinces in Cambodia through importing power from Lao PDR and Vietnam.? Key
indicators for the achievement of the above objectives were: (i) an increase of power imports by
Cambodia from Lao PDR and Viet Nam as per their Power Purchase Agreements; and (ii) the
proportion of demand met through power imports and reduction in cost of supply in selected
provinces of Cambodia. To this end, the project was to support the following components:

Component 1: 115 kV Transmission System: Vietnam border to Kampong Cham; (USD 9.85
million, 53.2% of total project cost). To facilitate importing power from the south of Vietnam to
the province of Kampong Cham in Cambodia by constructing a 64 km, 115 kV double-circuit line
from the supply point at the Vietnam border (Tan Bien located in Viet Nam) and three
distribution substations in Kampong Cham, Suong, and in Kraek towns.

Component 2: 115 kV Transmission System: Lao PDR border to Stung Treng; (USD 5.70
million, 30.8% of total project cost). To facilitate importing power from southern Lao PDR to the
province of Stung Treng in Cambodia by building a 56 km, 115 kV double-circuit line from the
Lao PDR border (at Veun Kham) and a substation in Stung Treng provincial town.

Component 3: Activities to Facilitate Implementation of Components 1&2 (USD 1.75 million,
9.5% of total project cost). To support consultancy services for: (i) project design and
management for components 1 and 2; (ii) a procurement agent; and (iii) vehicles, computers and
office equipment.




                                                 2
Component 4: Institutional Development of Electricité du Cambodge (EDC) (USD 1.00 million,
6.5% of total project cost). This was aimed at: (i) strengthening the internal auditing capacity of
EDC; (ii) engaging the services of experts for designing high voltage transmission systems
(including lines and substations) and optimizing system dispatch; (iii) providing overseas training
of EDC staff in the aforementioned fields; and (iv) procuring both hardware and software.

Total project costs were projected at USD 22.197 million, with USD 18.5 million financing by an
IDA grant and USD 3.697 million by the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC). One-third of
the IDA grant was charged to the country envelope and the remaining through the IDA 14
Regional Projects Pilot program.

Implementation arrangement

The Project was implemented by EDC. A project management unit (PMU) at EDC (EDC-PMU)
was established to supervise implementation of the Project. A Project Manager was appointed by
EDC. A Project Implementation Consultant (PIC) was engaged to assist the EDC-PMU to review
detailed engineering designs, supervision of works, contract administration, testing, and
commissioning. Following RGC’s decision, an International Procurement Agent (IPA) was
contracted by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to carry out the procurement for all
Bank projects. The IPA was responsible for preparing the bidding documents and request for
proposals, calling for tenders, conducting bid evaluations and making recommendation for
contract award and assisting the project implementing agency in contract negotiations for the
selection of consultants.

2. Post-Approval Experience and Reasons for Cancellation.

The Grant was approved by the Board on June 5, 2007, signed on August 14, 2007, and made
effective on February 4, 2008. Key issues which led to project cancellation are discussed below.

Major Implementation Delays. Project implementation suffered serious procurement delays in
its early stages. As of May 2009, there was little procurement progress due to poor cooperation
between Electricité du Cambodge (EDC) and the IPA. Both parties failed to complete the
bidding documents for supply and installation of the two cross-border transmission lines
(Component 1 & 2). While the IPA complained that technical data provided by EDC was not
sufficiently detailed to allow the IPA to prepare the bidding documents, EDC countered that
adequate technical data was provided and that the delays were due to the IPA’s own inefficiency.
Additionally, EDC officially proposed to remove the GMS Power Trade Project from the IPA
arrangement. A tripartite meeting (EDC/MEF/Bank) was organized in May 2009 to resolve this
issue and expedite procurement and project implementation. The meeting concluded the
following: (i) the IPA arrangement would continue for the project; and (ii) a designated team
should be appointed within the IPA to manage the procurement for this Project. After this
meeting, slow procurement progress was made.

Major Design Changes Proposed during Project Implementation. In light of the two year
delay in the procurement of the cross-border transmission lines, RGC proposed major design
changes to accelerate implementation and to keep the project relevant in the face of rapid changes
in the regional power sector. In November 2009, EDC and MEF informed the Bank of their
decision to finance the work under component 1 (i.e. the transmission line connection to
Vietnam) through alternative sources of funds. They further requested that the Grant funds
allocated to Component 1 be reallocated to Component 2 to develop the cross-border

transmission line with Lao PDR. However, the line was never built because Viet Nam decided
not to export power owing to an unexpected domestic load surge in 2010.

Upgrading the Cambodia – Laos Transmission Line. In response to Viet Nam’s decision not
to export power, EDC agreed with its counterpart, Electricité du Laos (EDL), to import more
power from Lao PDR. On August 6, 2010, RGC officially requested a restructuring to upgrade
the Cambodia-Laos transmission line from 115 kV to 230 kV to increase the line’s firm capacity
from 80 MW to 300 MW per circuit and to use the savings from Component 1 (Cambodia-
Vietnam line) to finance the increased cost of the Cambodia-Laos 230 kV line. Cancellation of
Component C-4 (Institutional Strengthening of EDC) was also proposed to use those savings to
upgrade this line. This restructuring plan was based on an extensive system planning work,
negotiations between EDC and EDL, and tripartite meetings among EDC, EDL, and the Bank in
early 2010. Based on a careful re-scheduling, the three parties also concluded that a two-year
extension of the closing date would be needed, from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2013,
the same closing date as the Laos GMS Power Trade Project. Preparation work to upgrade the
230 kV transmission line was initiated in June 2010, on both the Lao PDR and Cambodia sides.
EDC demonstrated their commitment to this new 230 kV line by efficiently achieving the
following major milestones that complied with the agreed implementation plan:

    (i) A redesign of the 230 kV line was completed in February 2011.
    (ii) For environmental and social impact assessment and mitigation, field surveys of the new
         transmission corridor, which increased from 35m to 50 m wide, and consultations in the
         project affected areas were conducted from June to September 2010. An updated EIA,
         EMP, and RAP – reviewed and confirmed acceptable by the Bank – were disclosed in
         the InfoShop on March 22, 2011, and in the country on March 9, 2011.
    (iii) Bidding documents were completed by the IPA, and a no-objection from the Bank was
          obtained on May 12, 2011. The ICB tendering was issued on May 25, 2011. This
          schedule was ready for contract signing by December 2011, and construction was to be
          completed by September 2013.

Failure to Extend Closing Date. A two-year closing date extension was included in the RGC’s
official restructuring request in August 2010. Initially, the Bank informed RGC that it would
confirm the project restructuring only if the implementing agency could demonstrate concrete
progress in preparing the new 230 kV transmission line (notably processing the necessary
procurement that would ensure project completion by December 31, 2013). In June 2011, Bank
management informed EDC that the RGC’s request for project restructuring—including the
closing date extension and a change in the project development objective to remove reference to
Vietnam—could not be processed due to country program conditions. Without the two year
extension of the closing date, EDC could not proceed with ICB procurement for the supply and
installation of the 230 kV line because it could not afford to self-finance the associated works.
EDC would also suffer huge financial losses if it did finance the line and then Lao PDR was
unable to meet the agreed schedule. Seeing no viable options, RGC requested a full cancellation
of the grant for this project on October 4, 2011.

3. Assessment of Bank Performance
Quality at Entry was moderately satisfactory. At appraisal, the project development objectives
rightly responded to the key country and sector issues, both technical and fiduciary. The project
design, including implementation arrangements, was appropriate to support the achievement of
the PDO. The project’s overall risk was assessed as “substantial?. Adequate arrangements for


                                               4
mitigation of identified risks were coordinated at both project and country levels, and included
the IPA arrangement for procurement and incorporation of a Good Governance Framework
(GGF) into the project design.

However, some risks were not foreseen at appraisal. First, the default of committed power
export by the Vietnam side was not envisaged for two reasons: (a) a draft negotiated power
purchase agreement between the power utilities in both Cambodia and Vietnam was pending
signature during project preparation, and (b) Vietnam’s surge in domestic load growth in 2010-
2011 had not been expected in its medium and long-term system planning. Second, the
deterioration of the Bank’s relationship with RGC prevented the restructuring from being
considered by the Board in 2011. Third, the task team did not identify the risk of serious
procurement and implementation delays due to the poor coordination between EDC and the IPA.
These delays rendered it impossible to complete the project two years before its parallel Lao
GMS PT project and, subsequently, posed tremendous difficulties when the Bank declined to
consider the closing date extension which ultimately resulted in project cancellation.

Safeguards. Regarding the environmental safeguards, the Project was assigned “Category B?,
which was correct because potential impacts were expected to be moderate, of limited spatial
influence and of short duration. Five safeguards were triggered: Environment Assessment,
Natural Habitats, Physical Cultural Resources, Involuntary Resettlement, and Projects on
International Waterways (due to the Lao portion of the project). The project was carefully
designed to comply with all five safeguards.

For example, the transmission line was to be routed to minimize social impact and designed to
meet the international standards to minimize exposure to electric and magnetic fields. The use of
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was prohibited. Given the importance of the Stung Treng
Ramsar site and the surrounding lowland dry forests for large water-birds (storks, cranes, and
ibis), bird mortality from line strikes was fully taken into account. Key mitigating measures,
which aimed to increase the visibility of the power line and its conformity with the existing
natural obstacles in the landscape to reduce the risk of collisions, were agreed for implementation.
These included (i) the use of suspension insulators and perch deniers incorporation of high
visibility markers specifically designed for birds, particularly on the earth wire; and (ii)
maintaining the height of line supports to about 25m bringing it in line with the canopy height of
the surrounding forest and trees.

A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was prepared based on a detailed impact survey and proposed
compensation policies. The socio-economic survey carried out for RAP preparation indicated that
there were no ethnic minority villages along the two transmission lines. Upon a review of this
survey and consultations with the local officials, the Bank concluded that the Policy on
Indigenous People was not triggered. To ensure that affected people would be able to restore their
living conditions and livelihoods after resettlement, a set of compensation standards, based on a
2006 replacement cost survey, had been included in the RAP.

Bank’s Supervision and Implementation Assistance was Moderately Unsatisfactory.
Throughout the project implementation process, the task team provided close supervision on key
issues, worked proactively in facilitating coordination and cooperation among the key parties on
the Cambodia side, and provided close support on various technical and fiduciary issues. The task
team played a key role facilitating EDL and EDC to update their system expansion planning and
reaching understandings on export and import of energy to cope with the changed context of
regional power trade. The Bank management teams in the Phnom Penh and Bangkok offices
provided timely guidance on key issues and raised issues beyond the control of the project to the


                                                 5
highest level of the Cambodia Government agencies and at the country portfolio level, which
helped reach solutions among the key stakeholders in a very difficult country environment.

In responding to the major procurement delays, a key factor in the cancellation, the Bank kept an
open mind toward solving the Cambodia internal institutional issues generated by the IPA
arrangement. With a dedicated team acceptable to all parties, the Bank also facilitated the regular
coordination among the key parties for procurement and provided extensive hands-on support to
EDC on technical and safeguard issues and procurement work. This resulted in the procurement
and implementation timetable for the new 230 kV line staying in line with the agreed schedule.
Moreover, the Bank actively supported EDC in responding to the unexpected default of Vietnam
for power export, and facilitated tripartite meetings between EDC, EDL, and the Bank to respond
to the changed regional power trade context.

The task team maintained cordial and productive relations with EDC and the government
institutions involved despite the fall-out from an unrelated Inspection Panel case (see paragraph
below). Both preparation and supervision teams were technically strong. Supervision benefited
from strong task team continuity and inputs from sector experts. The Bank also showed good
judgment, persistence, and was proactive in resolving difficult issues in a timely manner, as
discussed in the previous section.

Significantly, however, the Bank team was not able to process or formally respond to EDC’s
request for restructuring and extension of the Grant Closing date in a timely way, due to broader
concerns on the Bank's engagement in Cambodia in relation to the Inspection Panel case of the
Land Management and Administration Project. In this context, EDC decided not to proceed with
the procurement of the cross border 230 kV transmission system. This posed important financial
difficulties and risks for EDC to conclude its negotiations with private investors for the
downstream 230 kV transmission lines. Subsequently, the project was cancelled at the request of
the Government.

In light of the fact that the Bank's inability to make a decision on the extension eventually
impeded the project from achieving its development objective, the Bank performance at
supervision is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory, and overall Bank performance is rated as
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

4. Assessment of Borrower Performance

Performance of the Government: During preparation, the RGC was supportive in the design and
preparation of the project. However, during project implementation, major delays in procurement
– which was managed through the IPA who was directly contracted by MEF – jeopardized
project implementation. This became one of the fundamental causes of project cancellation. The
project implementation could have benefited from stronger and more regular coordination at
suitably high levels among the different government entities involved, including the IPA. The
overall performance of borrower is thus moderately satisfactory.

Performance of the Implementing Agency: With regard to the procurement process, the first year
of implementation was adversely affected by unsatisfactory performance of the IPA to prepare
the bidding document. During the project restructuring, a new IPA was in place with which EDC
had established a better working relationship. EDC engaged Korea Electric Power Corporation
(KEPCO) in June 2010 to assist them in revising the project designs, technical specifications,
technical scheduling, and modifying EIA/EMP and RAP required for bidding to start and to
complete the restructuring. However, the PMU and the Social and Environmental Management


                                                6
Unit (SEU) of the EDC, which were assigned to manage the project with initially three staff, were
overwhelmed with other projects financed by different sources. The review and clearance of
technical specifications, technical schedules, and safeguard documents revised by their respective
consultants, took much longer than expected to be finalized by EDC. The overall performance of
the implementing agency is thus rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Given the moderately satisfactory rating for government (borrower) performance and the
moderately unsatisfactory rating for implementing agency performance, the overall borrower
performance rating is moderately unsatisfactory.

5. Lessons Learned

The complexity of regional projects present implementation challenges. The project directly
involved three counties and at least three different agencies, all of whom had been operating in
different conditions and environments. It was clear that these agencies had different plans
regarding their power sector development—especially the differences of timeline for power
system (generation and transmission) development and expansion. It was hard for one agency in
one country to meet the timeline of another agency in another country. The cancellation of
Component 1 underlines this case, where the supply from Vietnam could not meet the demand in
Cambodia. To minimize risks and challenges of such a regional project, the following should be
taken into account: (i) a comprehensive power supply study including energy mix and cost of
generations is needed for power dispatching countries. The study should provide options for
power-dispatching countries to consider including temporary power purchases in case the supply
is forced to be cut because of unexpected surges in domestic power demand; (ii) the PPA and the
cross-border power tariff should be structured in ways to allow the participating countries to
adjust and for relevant parties to willingly trade power.

Firm and realistic commitment of relevant stakeholders and a well-designed PPA are
fundamental. Despite PPAs being signed by the participating countries, this was not sufficient to
ensure firm commitment of power supply. Due to increased internal demand for power, Vietnam
was not willing to export the agreed amount of energy, resulting in the cancellation of the 115 kV
transmission line from Cambodia to Vietnam under the project.

Without binding provisions in the PPA (or, alternatively, if the participating country does not
comply with binding provision of PPA of the regional power trade), the regional power trade
program can be adversely affected.

Examples of these binding clauses could focus on the following: (i) a minimum supply level, and
(b) a time frame for supply that would dictate when the power dispatching country would
execute—this would make the regional power trade more viable.

Similar binding provisions—such as the ability to absorb agreed upon amounts of energy to be
traded at predetermined levels and times—should be included in the PPA for not only power
producing countries but also power purchasing countries.

Uncoordinated policy decision matters. The RGC decision on September 7, 2006, to allow the
IPA to handle procurement activities under all Bank-financed projects caused setbacks during at
least the first 16 months of the project’s life. It seemed that it was not fully coordinated among
the government institutions which elevated the unwillingness of the implementing agency to
delegate procurement tasks to the IPA.



                                                7
A strong and well-staffed implementing agency delegated with suitable decision-making
authority is necessary for successful implementation. All decisions, even on technical aspects,
were centralized at the implementing agencies. The PMU and SEU of the implementing agency
took considerable amounts of time to review and provide technical recommendations. Their
recommendations, in turn, required a final round of decisions from a higher level authority in the
agency hierarchy, ultimately causing additional delays in getting the documents approved for
implementation.

A sound Bank/country relationship is the foremost factor of success. Besides the intention of
the project to help the client in “learning by doing? to develop modalities for cross-border power
trade, it is of paramount importance to ensure good faith in the country relationship if the
objectives are to be achieved. Following communication with the client in June 2011, that the
project restructuring—including the closing date extension—could not be processed owing to the
Bank’s decision to hold back all Board presentations (including the level one restructuring
necessary for this project), the RGC requested full cancellation of the Grant for this project, on
October 4, 2011.
