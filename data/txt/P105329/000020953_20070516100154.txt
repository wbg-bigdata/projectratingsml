A.      STRATEGIC CONTEXT A N D RATIONALE

1.      Country and Sector Issues

1.      The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), comprising of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar,
Thailand, Vietnam, and Yunnan province of China, spread over 2.3 million square kilometers,
houses a population of about 260 million. While growing rapidly, the region exhibits acute
disparity among the countries in terms of economic and human development. Despite a large
endowment of energy resources, the region's per capita consumption of electricity i s low ranging
from about only 63 kWh per annum in Cambodia to about 1,900 kWh per annum in Thailand.
The six GMS member countries are largely characterized by national electricity demands that do
not match with national electricity producing resources, thereby creating opportunities for power
trade. To meet their rapid demand growths and their concerns on energy security, the GMS
countries have decided to enhance regional cooperation in the power sector, strengthen regional
transmission networks, promote cross-border investments in energy resources, and develop a
regional electricity market in a phasedmanner.

2.      Power trade in the GMS holds the potential for significant economic and environmental
benefits, with a direct impact on poverty alleviation in the region.       Key benefits include:
enhanced energy security and reduced oil dependence; exploitation of economies of scale
through efficient location of generation projects; optimization of investments due to better daily
and seasonal matching of supply and demand; environmental benefits through the displacement
of fossil-fuel based power generation by renewable resources (primarily hydropower); lower
electricity prices; and faster economic development of the remote border areas through small
scale, cross-border power trade.

3.      GMS Regional Power Trade. A GMS Forum was established in early 1990s under the
leadership of Asian Development Bank (ADB). This was followed by signing of several
Memoranda of Understanding between the countries for power trade. To realize the long-term
vision of a regional electricity market, the GMS countries signed an Intergovernmental
Agreement on Regional Power Trade (IGA) in 2002, which was ratified by their respective
Parliaments between 2004 and 2005. While a competitive electricity market i s a long-term
objective, there i s consensus that it i s important to develop an appropriate framework for
strengthening trade and to start building up the regional transmission interconnections and
generation capacity. The institutional framework set up to implement the GMS objectives
comprises:

        The Ministerial Council on Economic Cooperation in the GMS - the highest level
        forum of the GMS process;
        The Energy Minister's Council - to provide strategic advice and policy guidance;
        The Regional Power Trade Coordinating Committee (RPTCC) - as the high level
        body responsible for coordinating the regional electricity market's development;
        The Focal Group (FG) for the planning and operation of regional power
        interconnections; and
        The Planning Working Group (PWG) whose members are responsible for cross-border
        transmission system planning and operational standards.



                                                 1

4.      Cambodia i s proposing to import power from Lao PDR and Vietnam (instead of using
local diesel-fired generators) to supply two of its provinces - Kampong Cham and Stung Treng-
and the proposed IDA Grants to Cambodia and Lao PDR will help inter alia finance these
cross-border interconnections. All three countries will be assisted by IDA in this initiative:
Cambodia and Lao PDR projects will be financed through the proposed IDA Grants while an
existing IDA Credit to Vietnam (System Efficiency Improvement, Equitization and Renewables
Project- SEER, US$225 million, FY 2002, Cr. 3680-VN) will be used to finance the Vietnam
portion of the Vietnam-Cambodia transmission line up to the Cambodia border.

Because of the regional nature of thepower trade program, and cross-border interconnections
supported by the proposed two IDA Grants, one combined Project Appraisal Document is
beingpresentedfor the sake of clarity. However, separate Grant and Project Agreements have
been negotiated with Cambodia and Lao PDR who will be responsiblefor investments within
their countries. Throughout the document, "Program" refers to the regional power trade
program, and the "Project" refers to Cambodia and Lao projects respectively, which are titled
"GMS-Power Trade (Cambodia)" and "GMS-Power Trade (Laos)".

5.       Cambodia Country Context. With a population of about 14 million and gross national
income of about US$380 per annum, Cambodia i s one of the poorest countries in the region,
having about 36% of its population living below the poverty line. National per capita electricity
consumption i s about 63 kWh p.a., electricity access rate i s less than 18%, while electricity
tariffs (grid-based tariff in the range of 9-23 USc/kWh, and tariffs in the rural area in the range of
30-90 USc/kWh) are among the highest in the world. With a very small, even though growing,
market, and the absence of a national grid, Cambodia does not have the opportunities of
benefiting from economies of scale in developing its energy resources in the near term. It has
therefore, quite appropriately, decided to adopt a regionally focused energy strategy.

6.       Lao PDR Country Context. A landlocked country of less than six million and gross
national income per capita of US$440 per annum, Lao PDR's major sources of growth are its
rich water and mineral resources. Through a strategy of developing its hydropower potential for
export to the neighbors, it has, apart from earning valuable foreign exchange, been able to
develop its own electricity network and increase access rates to nearly 45%.                Given its
substantial hydropower resources, it has the potential to grow into a major supplier to the
regional electricity market.

7.       Vietnam Country Context.         Vietnam i s endowed with a mix of energy resources,
including offshore oil and gas, coal and hydroelectric power.             Strong economic growth
(averaging 7.6 percent over the period 2001-2005) and increase in electricity access (household
access to electricity increased from 50 percent in 1996 to over 90 percent by 2006) has led to
rapid increase in electricity demand at an average 15 percent per annum between 1995 and 2004.
Vietnam forecasts an increase in generation capacity of over 15,000 MW from 2006-2010, and i s
actively looking at diversification of financing, greater private sector investment and increasing
imports from the GMS neighbors.

2.     Rationale for Bank Involvement

8.     Momentum for regional economic integration and, in particular, integration of electricity
systems among the countries in the GMS region has been growing steadily. The ADB, World
Bank ("Bank"), and other development partners are actively engaged in fostering a coordinated
approach towards development of the GMS countries' resources, and their activities currently
touch upon the following sectors - agriculture, environment, human resource development,
investment, energy (electricity), telecommunications, tourism, trade and transport. The Bank's
strategy i s now articulated in the April 2007 "Strategy Note on Economic Cooperation across the
Mekong Sub-Region." The Bank supports the development of frameworks for joint action; their
implementation through AAA, TA, capacity building, dialogue, and investment; and helps
ensure that what i s being proposed and implemented at the regional level complements and
reinforces country level activities and programs. The Bank's GMS regional assistance strategy
focuses on two main areas: (i)continued support to the development of power trade, and (ii)
enhancing collaboration on Mekong water resource management. Annex 1 summarizes (i)the
Bank's overall regional assistance strategy; and (ii)the Bank's approach toward supporting the
GMS power trade program.

9.      The Bank, with its unique experience with power markets in other regions (South East
Europe and Africa), i s well positionedto bring that experience to the GMS. It has been an active
participant in RPTCC meetings, and has worked intensively in shaping the RPTCC's agenda. At
a Bank-presented workshop on international experiences in June 2006, the participants expressed
a keen desire for the Bank to deepen its involvement in the GMS.

10.     The Bank has contributed to analytical work such as: (i)      developing a power import-
export strategy for Lao PDR and an Energy Sector Strategy Study for Cambodia, principles for
ownership and benefit-sharing of cross-border investment projects, and good practice guidelines
for bilateral power trade; (ii)defining the scope of work for an integrated regional power master
plan, supervising feasibility studies on EHV transmission interconnection between China-Laos-
Thailand; and (iii)helping prepare Terms of Reference (TOR) for the feasibility study of an
EHV interconnection between China and Vietnam, with the study to be financed through an
existing IDA credit. The Bank's continued presence in the GMS fora i s important for seeing the
aforementioned studies to fruition.

 11.    Adoption of modem bilateral power trade principles and mechanisms would support
organic growth of a regional power market and ensure that projects are developed under a
coherent framework of rules and standards that would enable fair trade and access to networks.
To keep up the momentum of moving towards a power market, it i s not only necessary to
continue supporting the ongoing analytical work, but to complement it with lending for critically
needed investments. The proposed IDA Projects would support high priority investments to
enhance regional power trade.

 12.    B y financing priority regional transmission interconnections, the proposed Projects would
help the participants in "learning by doing" to develop modalities for designing, financing, and
construction of cross-border transmission links for strengthening electricity trade between
electricity systems and power utilities - a first step towards developing a regional market.

3.      Higher Level Objectives to which the Projects Contribute

13.     Cross-border cooperation in the GMS i s driven by political, economic, environmental and
social considerations. In the early 1990s, a number of initiatives emerged to promote peaceful
relations and cooperation, economic development, economic integration, and efforts to address
shared social and environmental problems. This sense of "community" has continued to develop
over the last decade, with increasing cross-border trade and growing regional institutions.

14.     After an assessment of its ten-year-old program, ADB issued a Regional Cooperation
Strategy and Program (RCSP) for the GMS in March 2004, which comprises 11 flagship
programs, including regional power interconnection and trading arrangements. The proposed
Projects, in addition to contributing towards supporting the Bank's regional economic
cooperation strategy, would contribute towards achieving the overall regional cooperation
objective, through supporting the integration of regional power systems.

B.      PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1.      Lending Instrument

15.     GMS-Power Trade (Cambodia) and GMS-Power Trade (Laos) projects are proposed to
be financed through IDA Grants of US$18.5 million and US$lS million, respectively. For each
country, one third would be charged to the country envelope and two thirds funded through the
IDA 14 Regional Projects Pilot program. Power Company 2 (PC2) of Vietnam, which would
implement the transmission system in Vietnam for interconnection with Cambodia, has requested
funding of the project through the ongoing SEER Project (Cr. 3680-VN). No additional funding
from IDA14 Regional Projects Pilot Program i s being sought for this investment by Vietnam.

2.      Project Development Objective and Key Indicators

16.     The objective of the G M S Power Trade (GMS-PT) Program i s to lead to the
realization of an integrated GMS Power Grid and a Power Market (Section A.1). The attainment
of this objective and removal of barriers i s expected to take several years. These barriers are
being addressed through concerted and sustained efforts, over the next several years, on the part
of IDA, ADB and other development partners, and the GMS countries themselves through the
RPTCC.

17.     Within the long-term GMS framework, the proposed GMS-PT Projects (the Projects)
have the development objective of enhancing regional power trade within the Greater Mekong
Sub-Region with a view to also:        (i)bringing affordable grid-based electricity to selected
provinces in Cambodia through import of power from Lao PDR and Vietnam; and (ii)bringing
reliable electricity to the Saravan province in Lao PDR, while creating the conditions for
eventual interconnections of Lao PDR with other countries of the region.

18.     Key indicators for the achievement of the above objectives are: (i) increase in import of
power by Cambodia from Lao PDR and Vietnam as per their Power Purchase Agreements; (ii)
proportion of demand met through power imports and reduction in cost of supply in select
provinces of Cambodia; and (iii)timely completion of a modern load dispatch center (LDC) in



                                                 4

Lao PDR, with increased capacity of EdL to optimize its system operation through acquisition of
adequate slulls by its staff to undertake load dispatch.

3.     Project Components

19.    Overall, the Project has the following main components.           Detailed, country-specific
project component descriptions (Cl-C4 for Cambodia, and L l - L 7 for Lao PDR) are in Annex 4.

Component 1: Development of cross-border 115 kV Transmission Line linking Lao PDR (Ban
Hat) and Cambodia (StungTreng) to facilitate import of lower cost electricity from Lao PDR to
displace higher cost diesel-fueled generation sources in Cambodia.

Component 2: Development of cross-border 115 kV Transmission Line linking Vietnam (Tan
Bien) and Cambodia (Kampong Cham) for bilateral power exchanges, beginning with imports of
lower cost electricity from Vietnam to displace diesel-fueled generation in Cambodia, and
leading over the long term to the transfer of surplus hydropower from Cambodia to Vietnam.

Component 3: Development of the Xeset 1 to Saravan segment of the proposed 115 kV
Transmission Link that would eventually interconnect electricity grids from (western) Thailand
through (southern) Laos to (southern) Cambodia.

Component 4: Development (feasibility, design, building, commissioning) of a modern Load
Dispatch Center (LDC) for Lao PDR to facilitate regional power trade. An LDC, from a regional
perspective, i s essential for bringing: (i) voltage and frequency control; (ii)system protection
and reliability; and (iii)technical information on exchange and dispatching, up to the minimum
standards required for security of the grids in neighboring countries that are connected, or will be
connected, to EdL's system. B y doing so, development of grid-to-grid interconnections and the
security of a future integrated GMS power grid would be enhanced.

Component 5: TA activities in support of: (i)      development, through a regional perspective, of
feasibility study for hydropower generation for facilitating regional power trade; (ii)consulting
services for project implementation; and (iii) consulting services for institutional strengthening.

4.      Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design

20.     The Bank has financed three regional electricity market projects: (i) East Europe
                                                                                 South
called "Energy Community of South East Europe (ECSEE)" in December 2004; (ii) Africa     West
Power Pool (WAPP) in June 2005; and (ii)South Africa Power Market in October 2003.
Lessons learned across these projects and taken into account for designing the GMS framework
in general and GMS-PTProject, to the extent relevant, are:

   (i)Political consensus among the regional member countries to establish a regional
        electricity market, and conversion of that consensus into a political instrument is
        essential for guiding implementation. The IGA provides authorizing environment for
        various regional institutions and a platform to build consensus on market design.




                                                  5

  (ii)Multilateral financing support and access to global knowledge helps bring about
       political consensus. Involvement of the ADB, the Bank and bilateral donors, i s helping
        bring global knowledge and adaptation of lessons learnt from around the world.
   (iii)TechnicalAssistance (TA)andInstitutionalDevelopment supportarecriticalfor helping
        the countries design an appropriate market and implementation program. Extensive TA
        i s being provided by several donors and multi-donor Trust Funds - AfD, SIDA, JICA,
        and ESMAP. The GMS Forum, in which the Bank and other donors participate actively,
        provides an efficient mechanism for coordinating all TA activities.
   (iv) A clear vision, a road map for implementation, and alignment of investments to the road
        map is necessary for catalyzing support among market participants.           The vision i s
        defined through the IGA; an implementation program has been developed with active
        participation of the Bank and i s currently under discussion among GMS members; and a
        2002 indicative regional power master plan i s being updated.
   (v) Strengthening implementation capacity, and simplified project designs for expediting
        investments required to support trading is essential for achieving results on the ground.
        The proposed Project i s supported by exhaustive feasibility studies prepared with the help
        of international consultants funded through Japanese (PHRD) Grants and extensive
        implementation support i s built into the project design.

5.      Alternatives Consideredand Reasonsfor Rejection

21.     The Bank and the donors are providing: (i) at the regional level through the GMS
                                                       TA
Forum, and at the national level through country-specific projects; and (ii)financing for critical
investments required to       strengthen regional interconnections,       system operation       and
communication capacity to enable participation in regional power trade. Lack of financing, in
particular for relatively smaller countries, impedes opportunities for strengthening power trade.
Inthe absence of physical infrastructure, the policy and market framework for enhancing power
trade would be meaningless. Both ADB and the Bank are supporting investments, though in a
gradual manner, in physical infrastructure.

22.     In selecting the routes of the transmission lines and location of substations for all project
sub-components, alternatives with lower cost of construction but higher social and environmental
impacts have been rejected in favor of alternatives that reduce social and environmental impacts.

C.       IMPLEMENTATION

1.       PartnershipArrangements

23.      GMS-PT program i s a partnership between the countries of the GMS region, supported
by the Bank, ADB, and donors. It i s part of a broader regional economic integration initiative,
encompassing the ADB-led GMS program, the Mekong River Commission (MRC), UNESCAP,
UNDP and several ASEAN-related initiatives. GMS-PT, one of the eleven flagship programs of
the cooperation strategy, is primarily focused on integrating national markets to promote
economic efficiency. Duringimplementation of the Projects, the Bank would work closely with
its partners: the GMS countries and the donors actively involved in the initiative, e.g., ADB,
JICA, AfD and KfW.




                                                  6

2.      InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements

24.     Implementation Period.        The proposed GMS-PT (Cambodia) Project would be
implemented over a four-year period (September 2007 to August 2011), while the proposed
GMS-PT (Laos) Project would be implemented over a six-year period (September 2007 to
August 2013).

25.     Coordination between countries for implementation of cross-border transmission
systems. A number of committees and groups have been established since 1999 for cooperation
and coordination for power trade and cross-border transmission systems between Cambodia,
Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. These committees and groups are tasked to ensure cooperation on
electrical power sectors between the countries, and to report to the respective governments about
the progress of the cooperation and agreement. The Minutes of their meetings are recorded and
signed by the concerned parties to reflect agreements reached.

26.     For the transmission systems proposed under GMS-PT (Cambodia) and GMS-PT (Laos),
project level coordination committees have been established. These comprise representatives of
Electricite du Cambodge (EDC) and Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) from
Cambodia and representatives of relevant countries/power utilities in each committee, e.g., EdL
and DOE from Lao PDR, and EVNPC2 in case of Vietnam. These committees and groups,
which have met several times by now, have been coordinating on conduct of feasibility studies,
route alignment, technical standards and specifications, preparation of bidding documents,
synchronization of procurement schedule, and are expected to coordinate implementation to
ensure that construction of respective country components i s synchronized.

27.     Implementing Agencies for GMS-PT (Cambodia) Project. The Project would be
implemented by EDC. A project management unit (PMU) at EDC (EDC-PMU) will supervise
implementation of their respective components. A Project Manager has already been appointed
by EDC. A Project ImplementationConsultant (PIC) will be engaged to assist the EDC-PMU in
review of detailed engineering designs, supervision of works, contract administration, testing and
commissioning.

28.     Following RGC's recent decision to manage procurement of all BanWIDA projects
through an independent Procurement Agency (PA) to be contracted by the Ministry of Economy
and Finance (MEF), procurement will start only after the PA i s contracted by the MEF. The PA
would handle procurement under the supervision of a national Procurement Review Committee.
The Committee is empowered for review and approval of bidding documents, and finalization of
contracts.  Though the implementing agency will participate in the evaluation of bids and
contract negotiations, the process will be led by the PA under contract to MEF. The PA will
report to and be accountable to the MEF thereby strengthening objectivity in procurement
decisions.   A matrix clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the PA, the PIC, and the
implementing agencies i s in Annex 8.

29.     Funds Flow.     IDA Grant would be provided to the government who would make
available the proceeds of the Grant to EDC at 4 percent (US$) for a period of 20 years including
a grace period of five years, except for the cost of the PA for which funds would be transferred to
EDC on grant basis. Disbursement of the IDA Grant would be made through a Designated



                                                  7

Account (DA) of EDC or to supplierskonsultants through direct payments. EDC counterpart
funds would be channeled through normal EDC payment procedures.

30.     Safeguards.     According to government decree of June 2006, Inter-Ministries
Resettlement Committee (IRC) would be responsible for resettlement implementation for all
Bank funded projects in Cambodia on behalf of implementing agencies. As project sponsor,
EDC has participated in the process of preparing and approving the Resettlement Action Plans
(RAPS),reviewing compensation policies, and would deliver compensations through the IRC.
An external monitoring and evaluation team will be employed by EDC to carry out independent
monitoring and evaluation and RAP implementation, including payment of compensation to the
project affected people. A resettlement and environment unit has been established at EDC. To
strengthen institutional capacity for resettlement, TA will be provided for staff from both EDC
and IRC. EDC will be responsible for environmental management, including compliance by the
construction contractor with construction associated Environment Management Plans (EMPs).
A Project Implementation Consultant will be hiredto assist EDC.

31.     Implementing Agencies for Vietnam Portion of Vietnam-Cambodia Transmission
Line Power Company 2 (PC-2) of Vietnam will be responsible for implementing the investment
associated with component C-1, comprising the transmission system in Vietnam up to the border
with Cambodia (included within the scope of ongoing Cr. 3680-VN).             PC2 has been an
implementing agency in several IDA-financed operations in Vietnam, and has adequate
experience in implementing the proposed Project.

32.     Implementing Agencies for GMS-PT (Laos) Project. A project team at Ministry of
Energy and Mines (MEM) will be responsible for implementation of TA activities for detailed
feasibility study of the hydropower project (Component L-5) and collector substation system
(Component L-6) in Lao PDR.

33.     A PMU at EdL will be responsible for implementation of the transmission lines and
substations (Components L-1 and L-2), and the associated environmental and resettlement
activities. A Project Manager has already been appointed by EdL. A Project Implementation
Consultant (PIC) will be hired to provide TA to EdL during project implementation. The P M U
with adequate reinforcement of technical staff and extensive consulting assistance would manage
the LDC component. Procurement responsibilities would be handled by a single Procurement
Unit created for the proposed Project and ongoing IDA-financed Rural Electrification Phase-1
Project (REP I). would function under the overall supervision and control of EdL's central
                   It
Procurement Committee. A team of EdL staff, with the assistance of consultants, would be
responsible for updating the Tariff Study (component L-7).

34.     Funds Flow. IDA Grant would be provided to the government who would make available
the proceeds of the Grant to EdL at 4% (Lao Kip) for a period of 20 years including a grace
period of 5 years. The Grant proceeds, and the counterpart funds, for the TA component to be
implemented by MEM would be transferred to it as budgetary allocation. Disbursement of the
IDA Grant would be made through a Designated Account (DA) or to suppliers and consultants
through direct payments. EdL counterpart funds would be channeled through normal EdL
payment procedures.




                                                8

35.      Safeguards. EdL has experience in environmental and social impacts mitigation acquired
through previous and ongoing projects financed by IDA. MEM has limited, though growing,
capacity in management of safeguard issues. Safeguard capacities of both EdL and MEMwould
be enhanced through the Safeguard Capacity Building program to be implemented under IDA'S
on-going Rural Electrification Project APL-1, and Lao Environmental and Social Capacity
BuildingProject.

36.      Consultations, communication, and participation. Duringproject preparation extensive
consultations were held with the project affected people and communities along the transmission
route, civil society organizations, and environmental NGOs. In addition, consultations with
official counterparts and civil society are ongoing as part of Bank's consultations on "Economic
Cooperation across the Mekong Sub-region."

3.       Monitoringand Evaluation of OutcomesiResults

37.      Monitoring of the project implementation activities would be carried out through normal
review procedures for procurement, regular supervision missions, the Interim Financial Reports
(IFRs), periodic progress reports, annual audits of the entities and project financial reports
prepared under TA components.

38.      Monitoring of interim outcome indicators would be done through periodic reports from
the implementing agencies, consultants, and through supervision missions. The formats of
reporting and the base values of key monitoring indicators described in Annex 3 have been
discussed and agreed.

39.      At the GMS level the Bank would participate in: (i) design and implementation of the
                                                              the
regional program through RPTCC meetings; and (ii)review of consultants' TORS and their
reports; measuring progress against an agreed work program. The outcomes of various donor
funded activities would be measured against the benchmarks definedin their Grant agreements.

4.       Sustainability

40.      There have been clear signs of a momentum towards achieving the GMS goals: national
power utilities and IPPs of the GMS countries are already engaged in cross-border power
exchange; several MOUs between the GMS countries have been signed to import/export power;
and feasibility studies are being actively pursued for high voltage (HV) regional
interconnections.

41.      The IGA ratified by parliaments of all GMS member countries, the high political
visibility of regional economic integration, rapid demand growths, and growing concerns about
energy security have all contributed to strong political support to regional power trade. Their
continuing relevance, together with the smooth functioning of regional institutions, and active
participation of governments and utilities in the deliberations, reinforce sustainability.

42.      Even in an unlikely event of the GMS countries deciding not to pursue further regional
integration, the benefits of the proposed projects would sustain since power trade to be supported



                                                 9

by the proposed interconnections i s very economical and mutually beneficial for the trading
countries, and meets critical supply deficits in Cambodia and increases access inLao PDR.

D.      APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1.      Economic and Financial Analyses

51.     Economic and financial analyses have been performed for the following four Project
Components: C-1: Import of Electricity from Vietnam border to Kampong Cham in Cambodia;
C-2: Import of Electricity from Lao PDR border to Stung Treng in Cambodia; L-2: Supply of
Electricity from Xeset sub-station to Saravan in Lao PDR; and financial analysis for Component
L-1: export of electricity from Ban Hat sub-station in Lao PDR to the Lao PDR border. The
results are presented in tables below (see Annex 9 for details):


   No                       ProjectSub-component                              NPV US$million

52.     I t i s concluded that all Project components which involve transmission of electricity
through a 115kV transmission system are least cost compared to the next best alternative of local
diesel-based generation. The ERRSof all the Project components are robust and remain above
the 10 percent threshold under probable unfavorable conditions relating to capital costs and
electricity sales. Additional sensitivity analyses for escalation of import tariff from Vietnam for
the Vietnam Border-Kampong Cham component (Annex 9) shows that for an annual tariff
increase of 2 percent in real terms (escalation 5 percent, inflation 3 percent), the ERR drops
from about 32 percent to about 26 percent under the base-caseScenario. Even for the worst case
scenario (Sensitivity Case IV) the ERR declines from about 24 percent to about 17 percent,
which still maintains the Project's economic viability.




                                                 12

53.     The FIRRs of the Project components are positive for tariffs which are well below
(Cambodia) or near (Lao PDR) prospective tariffs. In the Case of Component C-1, the break-
even sales tariffs are 13USc/kwh and 15 USc/kwh, for escalation in real terms of import tariff
from Vietnam, of 1percent and 2 percent, respectively.

54.     Summary of EDC's financial performance. EDC's financial condition would continue to
be fragile mainly due to operational constraints. EDC will have to manage the risks of high and
volatile cost of fuel; delays in collecting Government arrears; and generating sufficient internal
and external financing to sustain operations and enable self-financing of investment.         The
financial situation of EDC i s projected to improve throughout the period FY06-12, provided: (i)
implementation of the revised tariff structure and automatic fuel adjustment in tariff continues;
(ii)fuelprices remainstable; (iii)Vietnam-Cambodia220kVinter-connectionisimplemented
on time; (iv) system losses remain steady; and (v) receivables collection performance targets are
met.

55.     Summary of EdL's financial performance. Since 2001, EdL's financial performance has
been steadily improving due to adequate tariff adjustments and efficiency improvements.
However, this trend could be adversely affected by the recent changes in GoL's approach to
significantly increase EdL's investment program, using it as a vehicle for GoL's equity
investment in export-oriented IPP Projects. In addition, delays in settlement of Government
arrears would have an adverse impact on EdL's profitability and cash-flows.            Key actions
required to continue financial recovery are:           (i)largely confining EdL investments to
transmission, distribution, and rural electrification; and (ii)directing GoL's equity investment in
other generation projects to a separate investment company. The Bank would, through policy
dialogue, review Government's plans for investments in export-oriented hydropower projects,
and provide necessary technical advice in selection of an appropriate financing vehicle for these
investments.

2.      Technical

56.     115 kV Transmission lines and substations (Components C-1, C-2, L-1, L-2). These
components are technologically straightforward and well within the execution capabilities of,
EDC and EdL. Comprehensive state-of-the-art designs and associated bid documents have been
prepared by Consultants during project preparation. Necessary project management consulting
services would be engaged to assist EDC (more extensive) and EdL (limited) in implementation.

57.     LDC (Component L-4). Design of the LDC is technologically sophisticated. Hence, a
well-experienced Consultant would be extensively engaged to undertake detailed feasibility,
detailed designs, and technical specifications, and provide full project management support and
training to EdLduring implementation.

58.     Detailed Feasibility Study of Hydropower Projects (Component L-5).                Detailed
feasibility study of hydropower project selected in Lao PDR based on the pre-feasibility studies
accomplished during Project preparation would be executed by Consultants. EdL has sufficient
experience in managing consulting service contracts of this nature.

59.     TA for Collector Substation (Component L-6) involves study of technical, legal,
commercial, ownership, financing, and pricing issues associated with shared facilities for


                                                  13

evacuation of power from a cluster of hydropower projects. International consultants would be
engaged to assist EdL, MEM,and Lao Holding State Enterprises.

60.    TAfor Updating Tarif Study (Component L-7)would assist EdL in updating the current
Tariff Study, which i s over two years old, with emphasis on assessing the impact of export-
import tariffs in a rapidly changing investment scenario.       EdL's financial analysts are well
capable of handling this component, under expert guidance.

3.     Fiduciary

61.    Financial Management (for both Cambodia and Lao PDR). Financial management
assessments, following BP/OP10.02 guidelines concluded that the implementing agencies in
each country have the ability to satisfactorily manage the accounting and disbursement of the
Grant.   With actions to strengthen the financial management arrangements (see Financial
Management Action Plan (Annex 7), the Project's overall financial management risks are
considered moderate. Necessary agreements have been reached in regard to maintenance of
financial accounts and records; submission of quarterly IFRs and annual audited financial
statements to the Bank by an independent auditor, satisfactory to the Bank.

62.    Procurement Aspects (for both Cambodia and Lao PDR):                For the cross-border
transmission system from Laos to Cambodia, two separate yet synchronized and coordinated
bidding processes will be conducted by the two countries. A joint Coordination Committee will
coordinate this process. An independent PA will be contracted to handle procurement for
ongoing and future IDA projects in Cambodia. In addition, EDC will follow good governance
practices in handling procurement processes, including but not limited to the following: (i)
enhancing transparency through greater public disclosure of procurement related information
(such as procurement plans, bidding documents and RFPs, consultant longlists and shortlists, and
contract awards, etc.); and (ii)complying with the procurement complaint handling procedures
and sanction requirements as set forth in the existing Government procurement rules and
regulations.

63.     Procurement Capacity Assessments of EDC and EdL have concluded that: (i)EDC has
moderate experience and capacity to carry out procurement and            would need substantial
assistance of international consultants; while (ii)EdL has adequate experience and capacity to
carry out the task with limitedconsulting assistance. The procurement risk for EDC i s rated as
"high" in view of the perceived country risk. Appointment of the PA for Cambodia would
mitigate this risk. The procurement risk for EdL i s rated as "average."

4.      Social

64.     GMS-PT (Cambodia) Project. The proposed two 115 kV transmission lines in Cambodia
follow existing national roads.    A limited amount of land would need to be acquired for
substations, tower bases, and right of way (ROW) clearance. Duringconstruction, about 6 ha of
land would be occupied temporarily for access roads, storage, and soil deposit/borrowing sites.
About 6,400 trees and 94 small shops would need to be removed from the ROW. A RAP was
prepared by EDC based on a detailed impact survey and proposed compensation policies.




                                                14

65.     The socio-economic survey carried out for preparing RAP indicated that there are no
ethnic minority villages along the two transmission lines and upon review of this survey and
consultations with the local officials, the Bank concluded that the Bank Policy on Indigenous
People i s not triggered.

66.     To ensure that affected people would be able to restore their living conditions and
livelihood after resettlement, a set of compensation standards, based on a 2006 replacement cost
survey has been included in the RAP. These compensation standards and rates have been
reviewed and endorsed by the IRC.
67.     Extensive consultations have been carried out with concerned villagers, and a
resettlement information booklet translated into local language distributed to affected villages. A
well defined grievance redress mechanism will be established through the EDC-PMU, and an
Independent Monitoring Organization (IMO) would be appointed to monitor the resettlement and
compensation process.

68.     Surveys conducted found no historic, religious or cultural sites near the transmission line
routes. A "Chance-Finds procedure" for addressing such sites will be developed by the PMU in
conjunction with the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts.

69.     GMS-PT (Laos) Project. The proposed two 115kV transmission lines would need
acquisition of limited amount of land and moderate resettlement. Two RAPSwere prepared by
EdLbased on impact survey and socio economic survey among all potentially affected families,
and proposed compensation policies.

70.     To ensure that affected people would be able to restore their living conditions and
livelihood after resettlement, a set of compensation standards has been developed following the
policies for similar projects inLaos.

71.     The socio-economic survey indicated that there are ethnic minority villages along the
Xeset 1to Saravan Line. Located along the major regional road, these ethnic minorities have a
highdegree of integration with the dominant population, and impact caused by transmission lines
would be very small. The Bank has concluded that Bank Policy on Indigenous People i s not
triggered.

72.     Extensive consultations have been carried out with concerned villagers, and a
resettlement information booklet describing compensation entitlement would be translated into
local language and distributed to affected villages.

73.     A well defined grievance redress mechanism would be established and an Independent
Monitoring Organization (IMO) will be appointed to monitor the resettlement and compensation
process.

74.     Lao PDR has satisfactory "Chance Finds procedures", developed during preparation of
the Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric project, for protecting physical cultural resources discovered
duringcivil works. These procedures will be applied under the proposed Project.




                                                 15

5.      Environment

75.     All components of the Project (involving physical construction in Cambodia and Lao
PDR) are in compliance with all environmental assessment (EA) policies and procedures of the
governments of Cambodia and Lao PDR, and the World Bank safeguard policies on
environmental assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01). Both the Projects have been assigned "Category
B" as potential impacts are moderate, of limited spatial influence and/or of short duration.

76.     The proposed transmission lines are interconnections with the networks of Vietnam and
Laos and are not linked to power evacuation from specific hydropower projects.

77.     Extensive consultations have been carried out with concerned villagers in Cambodia and
Lao PDR. The EMP and RAP have been disclosed to the public: (i)from August 14 at EDC's
offices at Phnom Penh, Kampong Cham, and Stung Treng, and at MIME offices at Kampong
Cham and Stung Treng; and (ii)from September 2, 2006 at EdL's offices at Vientiane;
Nakokhpho, District Saravan; Bungyor, District Parkse. They were also disclosed: (i)at the
Bank's Public Information Centers in Phnom Penh and Washington on August 1, 2006; and (ii)
at the Bank's Public Information Centers in Vientiane and Washington on August 24, 2006.
RGC and GoL have agreed to implement the EMPs (see Annex 10) in a manner satisfactory to
the Bank.

78.     The primary bio-physical impacts associated with transmission line construction and
operations are land use change, vegetation loss, minor habitat loss, migratory bird collisions, and
minor erosion. N o pesticides would be involved in clearing ROWS.

79.     Transmission lines would be routed to minimize social impact and designed to
international standards to minimize exposure to electric and magnetic fields.                Use of
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) would be prohibited.

80.     The alignment of the power line in Stung Treng runs through an area that was until
recently dominated by lowland dry forests - predominantly dry dipterocarp and mixed deciduous,
with small patches of semi-evergreen forest. Rapid clearance of forest along National Route 7
has taken place within the last few years, however, leaving a cleared corridor of 500-1000m
centered on the road over most of the length of the section. Remaining forest reaches up to the
road in a few locations, but these areas are already impacted and are in the process of being
cleared. Additional loss of natural habitat due to construction of the power line will not be
significant, and i s effectively minimized by the current line alignment.

81.     Bird mortality from line strikes i s a concern for this line section given the importance of
the Stung Treng Ramsar site and the surrounding lowland dry forests for large water-birds
(storks, cranes and ibis). The Ramsar site, however, lies more than 1 km from the alignment at
the nearest point in the extreme south. There are no other known critical wetland habitats within
500m of the power line where a significantly elevated local risk would be expected. There i s a
general risk along the entire Stung Treng line section, however, because the lowland dry forest
blocks between which the line alignment passes form a regional focus of large water-bird and
vulture activity. Two Globally Critically Endangered species of ibis - Giant Ibis and White-
shouldered Ibis- are of particular concern as ibis fly low (just above the canopy level), even
when traveling over larger distances.


                                                 16

82.    The key mitigating measure proposed i s increasing the visibility of the power line and its
conformity with the existing natural obstacles in the landscape to reduce the risk of collisions.
This would involve:

       incorporation, in addition to the standard measures of using suspension insulators and
       perch deniers, of high visibility markers specifically designed for birds, particularly on
       the earth wire; and
       maintaining the height of line supports to about 25m bringing it in line with the canopy
       height of the surrounding forest and trees.

83.    The feasibility study for the hydropower project would include an assessment of
environmental and social impacts, dam safety issues, and potential riparian issues; review the
application of Bank's safeguards policies, and make recommendations on mitigation measures,
according to TORSsatisfactory to the Bank.

Vietnam portion of Cambodia-Vietnam transmission line

84.    Vietnam has an environmental law and since it has decided to use an existing IDA Credit
(SEER, Cr. 3680-VN) for financing this transmission line it will follow the safeguards
requirements in the PAD (Report 24192-VN) and legal agreements governing that Credit.

7.      Policy Exceptions and Readiness

85.     Both Projects are in compliance with IDA policies and procedures without policy
exceptions, and meet readiness criteria for implementation, except for delay in finalization of bid
documents by Cambodia. The Government of Cambodia has decided to engage an independent
Procurement Agent (PA) for all IDA projects.               Though the bidding documents have been
prepared by EDC and reviewed by the Bank, as per the Government's policy these can be issued
only by the PA, which has not yet been hired. Contracting of the PA i s therefore proposed as a
condition of effectiveness.

                                        MEKONG     SUB-REGION
1.      The Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS)-comprising                 Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar,
Thailand, Vietnam, and China (Guangxi and Yunnan provinces)-is                   geographically located
among the fast-growing economies of both South and East Asia and the opportunitiesfor
further strengthening cooperation and integration are plentiful. Regional initiatives are active
and countries in the GMS are increasingly looking to maximize development benefits through
enhanced cooperation with their neighbors.           Yet the issues involved are complex and the
institutions and often the information are not strong enough to enable each country to assess fully
the benefits and risks to the trade-offs that stronger regional cooperation may bring. Additional
critical bottlenecks      to achieving these benefits-infrastructure,            appropriate regulatory
environments, the level and distribution of skills, and the levels of cooperation and coordination
among countries and among partners-need to be addressed.
                                 Regional Context and Cooperation

2.       The sub-region's size and diversity suggest significant economic potential (Table 1).
With a total population of 315 million and total GDP of more than US$350 billion, its growth i s
one of the fastest in the world. Exports have expanded very rapidly in the GMS countries.
Foreign investment inflows have also been robust in these GMS countries, including cross-
border investments from one GMS country to another. A key driver of this recent strong private
sector led growth performance has been the dramatic opening up of the lower income countries.

3.      The diversity among GMS countries also poses considerable challenges. Although
there has been progress in poverty reduction throughout the sub-region, poverty rates remain
high in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar. Social indicators show considerable variation
among GMS countries, with Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar lagging other countries in
education and health.

4.      Recognizing the economic benefits of closer regional integration and the need for
closer cooperation to reach this goal, the World Bank has been working collaboratively on
GMS issues with a number of key regional cooperation programs and initiatives although to
varying degrees and at varying levels of intensity over time. The primary focus has been on
work with the GMS Economic Cooperation Program, and the Mekong River Commission
(MRC). The Bank has also been working on GMS issues with other programs and institutions
that have a broader mandate throughout East Asia-including     the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), UNESCAP, UNDP, as well as with a number of bilateral donors that also aim
to support regional integration.

5.      I n the GMS Economic Cooperation Program, launched in 1992 with the support of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank has played a supportive and complementary
role, reinforcing the ADB's lead role in coordination. The most active role for the World Bank
to date has been in the energy sector where the Bank contributed to a regional study on power
trade strategy followed up by technical assistance to lay the foundation for implementation. The
Bank has also worked on a joint initiative with ADB on water resources to develop the Mekong
Water Resources Assistance Strategy (MWRAS) which i s now transitioning into an assistance
and investment program. The World Bank's Foreign Investment Advisory Service has also
supported trade and investment promotion activities in the GMS program, and a number of
World Bank-financed projects in the GMS countries include components that are considered part
of the overall GMS Program. Bank support for regional activities under this Strategy will be
coordinated and channeled through the existing institutional mechanism of the GMS forum.

6.       The Bank has had a long relationship with the MRC dating back to the early 1990s
when the WorldBank participated in the meetings leading to the Mekong Agreement and the
creation ofthe MRC. In 1996, the MRC Council asked the World Bank to take the lead in
helpingthe MRC develop the Water Utilization Program (WUP), which was approved in 2000 as
a Global Environment Facility (GEF)-funded regional technical assistance project and i s now
under implementation. Under the WUP, the World BanWGEF is working with three other co-
financiers-Japan,   Finland, and France-to    support the four member countries' aspirations to
establish a cross boundary hydrological model and develop a set of key procedures for water
utilization. While other bilateral donors including Denmark, Germany, Belgium, France, and
Finland play an important role, the World Bank i s the lead multilateral donor to the MRC and its
support and influence are important to achieving MRC's long-term objectives.

                                 Opportunitiesand Challenges

7.      Bolstered by the vibrant economies and rich natural resources of both South and East
Asia, regional cooperation in the GMS provides plentiful opportunities to further strengthen
economic cooperation and integration. The economic diversity in the GMS countries and the
current low level of integration also offer opportunities, with Thailand, China, and Vietnam



                                               20

providing large markets and regional knowledge from which they can continue their own paths
of economic development and from which other GMS countries can learn. Most of the countries
are already undertaking measures to enhance their ability to benefit from the opportunities
presented. Economic structures, especially in the poorer countries, are in transition with the
roles of the public and private sector undergoing transformation, although to different degrees
(with Myanmar being the least developed and yet to begin on the much needed reform process
due to the political situation). The economies are becoming more diversified and open to trade
and are fast integrating into the regional and global economies. The structures of production-
although still heavily dependent on agriculture in many cases-are     changing rapidly. There are
also increased intra-sub-regional trade, investment, technology and migration flows. Private
capital and technology are already flowing from Thailand and China to the other countries to
combine with their land and labor to produce goods efficiently for the sub-region or for export.
More will flow as the investment climate improves, transport and trade facilitation gets better,
and goods can move more easily across borders. Governments are also investing or planning to
invest injoint regional projects in sectors such as water, power and transport.

8.      Developing opportunitiesfor even more successful regional cooperation and win-win
solutionsfor each country involved will take not only political commitment to continue with
economic reforms, but also stronger regional institutional frameworks and often stronger
country-level institutions.     The low-income countries, in particular, face a challenge of
implementing stronger, deeper, and more sustained economic reforms that will improve the
climate for investment, business, and private sector development. Economic reforms will also
need to focus on ensuring that growth i s broad-based, far-reaching, and provides both economic
opportunities and access to critical social services for the poorest members of society, including
ethnic minorities.

9.      The region as a whole faces a number of challenges and opportunities that require
strengthened institutions, infrastructure, policies and programs.        The first challenge i s to
improve natural resource management. The region i s rich in natural resources, including a
number of major rivers and extensive forests that are under tremendous pressure from
haphazardly planned and implemented activities. Sustainable use of these resources i s critical to
the future development of the sub-region. But this will require well-designed, well-coordinated,
and well-implemented programs and projects. Indeed, the cooperation of all the countries
involved i s essential to the maintenance and sustainable use of these resources and i s certainly
likely to bring more benefits to all countries than a haphazard uncoordinated process. Inthe case
of the use of the resources of the Mekong River, in particular, there has been significant progress
to date with the MRC emerging as a regional institution with sound knowledge on the river
system. The GMS countries are now more aware of the need to address water-issues on an
across-country basis, but significant work remains to help each country realize the mutual
benefits from this cooperation.

10.     Developing an integrated system for power production and trade poses another
challenge. The development of lower-cost (and higher quantity) sources of power supply are
critical to the economic development of both the higher- and lower-income countries of the
GMS. The uneven electricity demand along with mismatched availability of resources for
economic power production in the sub-region offers an excellent opportunity for power trading
and the development of a regional power market. But it i s essential that development of this


                                                 21

sector take place in a sound manner from a technical, as well as an environmental and social
perspective and this will require further strengthening of the existing institutional arrangements
including the Regional Power Trade Coordination Committee.

11.     The sub-region also needs better transport, communications and technology linkages
to underpin strong growth, cooperation, and connectivity. GMS cooperation can mobilize
support for improving infrastructure and linkages among all countries of the sub-region, which i s
critical to the more efficient flow of goods and services between countries and between remote
or land-locked areas and the main ports in the GMS. Expanding regional trade and enhancing
trade-facilitation will also help the GMS to take advantage of regional cooperation opportunities.
Finally, developing a better framework for managing the flow of workers across borders i s
essential. Policies and institutions for labor migration need to be strengthened to reduce harmful
illegal migration and human trafficking.

                              ProposedStrategy andWork Program

12.     The World Bank's GMS regional support strategy which has benefitedfrom extensive
stakeholder consultations (Box 1) will focus on two main areas-enhanced             support to the
development of power trade and collaboration on water resources management. World Bank
support for the power sector in the GMS will continue to enhance the development of an efficient
regional power trade market which increases access for the poor, provides affordable and
adequate power to meet the demands of increased growth, and maximizes the environmental
benefits by replacing fossil fuel thermal generation` with renewable sources. Work in water
resources management will concentrate on support for the MWRAS. The World Bank's recent
analytical work and involvement in the development of the MWRAS (together with the ADB)
has generated additional demand from GMS countries, the Mekong River Commission
Secretariat (MRCS), and an array of donors for the Bank's continued, and enhanced, role in the
sector at the regional level, and from there, at the respective country levels. Due to the World
Bank's involvement in the US$1.2 billion Nam Theun 2 (NT2) hydroelectric project in Lao
PDR, as well as work in other river systems around the world (for example, the Nile and Senegal
River Basins), the Bank can also bring specific project and basin development experience and
global knowledge to the table.

13.     A critical priority area of the Bank's support is the development of power trade. The
World Bank has a long track record of collaboration with the ADB, the GMS countries, and
other donors on regional power issues. The World Bank's ability to bring in global knowledge,
and specific and relevant experience in helping develop regional power markets in Africa and
Europe and Central Asia, and the Bank's history of a collaborative, fact-based approach to its
relationships and discussions, has positioned the Bank well to bring its experience to the GMS.
Bank support for the initial phase of power trade development included the establishment and
convening of meetings of the GMS Expert Working Group on Power Trade and Interconnection,
and TA and facilitation of the drafting of the GMS Intergovernmental Agreement on Power
Trade. Recent developments among GMS countries, including the financing of the NT2 project,
indicate a new phase of power trade market development.

                                    Box 1: Client Consultationson the Strategy

   The preparation of the strategy and the implementation of the work programs in power trade, water resource
   management, trade and transport facilitation, and labor migration have all served as important avenues for
   consultation and learning by the World Bank. They have also served to confirm country commitment to the
   strategy and more broadly to the four areas to be supported through the strategy.

   In December 2006 the Bank commenced on a comprehensive and more formal consultation exercise
   covering five of the six GMS countries-Cambodia,              China, Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam-
   encompassing, in most cases, government, donors ,the private sector, and relevant civil society actors. This
   exercise, which concluded in April 2007, has provided the Bank with valuable feedback which i s reflected in
   the strategy. The main issuesraised and advice received through this process included:

        a   Ensure that the World Bank strategy i s clearly aligned with the GMS Economic Cooperation
            Program;
            Ensure good donor coordination and no overlap of support;
            Recognize cross-sectoral linkages across programs, especially for water and energy;
            Demonstrate that the benefits of regional level engagement outweigh its costs;
            Engage actively with all of the GMS countries as partners;
            Recognize the inadequate quality of information on MekongRiver water;
             Make the case for a clearer approach on trade and transport facilitation, including how small
             operators can benefit, links with ASEAN, and the role of IFC;
        a    Try to involve all countries in the work on migration;
        a    Highlight the role of NGOs, private sector and concerned communities and how they will be
             consulted during implementation;
             Ensure sustainable development and adoption of appropriate safeguard policies;
             Integrate gender and social dimensions in the strategy;
             Recognize the critical importance of capacity building;
             Continue to consider whether the Bank can increase its involvement on environmenVforestry and
             health issues at a regional level; and,
             Put inplace a monitoring and results framework for the strategy.
   The ongoing and long established dialogue with the ADB has also benefited from a more formal consultation
   and exchange of views with the ADB in early 2007.


14.      Recent analytical work conducted by the World Bank and ADB shows that the regional
power trade market will need time to mature given the current limited physical infrastructure
and institutional framework at a regional level. Substantial groundwork has been laid for the
development of regional power trade, and there i s a strong interest to move forward. However,
many issues need to be addressed before concrete results in terms of actual "power trading" can
be achieved. The work program for GMS power trade therefore seeks to assist GMS clients to
develop the institutional and physical infrastructure to implement the first step needed for
building regional power trade. Institutional support will involve further analytic work and
capacity building, recognition of the important linkages between the power program and the
water resource and other programs, and a broader dialogue with all concerned stakeholders. As
part of this program, the Bank also expects to be providing investment support in FY07 to
finance, through the two proposed GMS Power Trade projects for Cambodia and Lao PDR,
cross-border transmission systems and other infrastructure; and in the medium term to be
supporting further infrastructure development through the Adaptable Program Loan instrument.
The GMS power program will need to draw on the lessons and experience of on-going projects


                                                          23

such as the Lao PDR NT2 hydroelectric project.             This is to ensure that the abundance of
hydropower resources in some of the GMS countries, such as Lao PDR, while contributing to the
regional power market are developed in a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable
manner.

15.      Going forward the World Bank and ADB intend to work with other donors in
supporting the MRC member countries and the MRCS to maintain the stakeholder dialogue,
increase transparency in policy formulation and decision-making, build$he capacity of all the
concerned institutions, carry out strategizing studies and investment reviews, and finance
sound water resource managementprojectsfor the Mekong River. The World Bank and ADB
will also assist the MRCS and the member countries to identify projects and interventions of
regional and trans-boundary importance. Such projects would create regional as well as local
benefits, and apply an integrated resource management approach in areas where consensus has
been reached such as flood and drought mitigation. As much as possible, such projects would
seek synergies, pool resources and yield economies of scale, and would support the
strengthening of governance structures for sub-basin water management. The partnership will
also explore how environmental and social safeguards for project preparation and
implementation could be streamlined and mainstreamed, and notably provide the platform for
undertaking Strategic Environmental Assessments.

 16.    To support regional actions on Mekong River water resources management, the Bank
would jointly develop a Mekong Integrated Water Resources Management Support Project
(M-ZWRMSP) with the MRC and the four member countries. The main objective of the M -
IWRMSPi s to establish a regional enabling framework for IWRM and help the four countries to
take the very first step towards collaborative action in the field to improve Mekong River water
resources management and alleviate poverty. The project would be mainly financed by regional
and country IDA allocations, but a significant amount of co-financing from the GEF would also
be sought. Based on progress on this first regional water project as well as on progress on other
studies and project preparation activities, a more substantial Mekong River Water Management
Project would then be considered. The technical assistance and capacity building activities and
the proposed regional water project tie in with the World Bank's country-level and other regional
 work.

 17.    I n addition to these two priority areas, the World Bank is also ready to provide
assistance in other ways, upon discussion with the GMS governments and other partners.
Two areas where work has already been identified and i s in the initial stages are support to trade
 and transport facilitation (TTF) and analytical work on labor migration in the GMS.

 18.    The World Bank has a long track record globally of working on tradefacilitation and
is currently providing support in this area at the country level in three of the GMS countries2.
 Engaging national governments to strengthen their national trade facilitation institutions and
 transport infrastructure can prepare them for collaborating effectively at the regional level. The


    The Cambodia Trade Facilitationand CompetitivenessProject was approvedby the World Bank Boardin June
    2005 and the Customs Modernization Project in Vietnam was approved in October 2005. The proposed
    Mekong Transport Infrastructure Development Project in Vietnam is expected to improve connectivity and
    access from the Mekong Delta to the main ports in Vietnam as well as to facilitate cross-border movements
    from PhnomPenhport through to Vietnam.


                                                    24

completion of road transport corridors across the sub-region and recent reductions in trade policy
barriers among GMS countries3 make support to sub-regional TTF timely.

19.     Labor migration in the GMS is an important but controversial issue. Very little
analytical work has been undertaken on labor market issues across the GMS countries. The
World Bank has significant experience in analyzing the issues surrounding labor markets
throughout the world and has developed this as an area of comparative advantage, and one that
has continued to develop since the 1995 World Development Report on "Workers in an
Integrating World." Labor markets are also an area where the ADB and other donors recognized
an important gap and felt that there was a critical role that the World Bank could play in helping
to clarify issues surrounding labor markets in the GMS.

20.     I n summary, the proposed work program over the period FY07-11 involves a series of
operations in the relevant GMS countries, complemented by AAA (Table 2). The FY07 Power
Trade Project will be followed by a project on Mekong River Water Resources Management in
FY09 and an operation to improve Trade Facilitation among the countries inFY09 or FY10 with
follow up projects expected in all three areas. AAA in these areas as well as in labor migration i s
already underway, and in most cases i s beingconducted in partnership with other stakeholders to
underpinthese operations and fill critical knowledge gaps in selected areas. The program will be
monitored regularly, including by the relevant GMS working groups, and take account of the
expected milestones and outcomes (Table 3); and the program will be carefully evaluated as a
basis for determining the engagement of the World Bank on these issues beyondFY11.

21.      This GMS strategy reflects a number of lessons learned by the World Bank over the
last decadefrom its various regional activities. Strong analytical work i s a critical cornerstone
of regional cooperation. Building ownership, commitment and capacity through consultative
approaches to both analytical and operational activities i s also important. Taking a participatory

    The ASEAN Free-Trade Agreement, the ASEAN-China liberalization program and the Thailand program of duty-free
    importsof agricultural productsfrom all GMS countries except China, have all loweredtrade barriers within the sub-region.


                                                           25

and consultative approach to activities, while more time consuming, i s essential for building
consensus around issues that may be sensitive, building capacity of the different stakeholders,
and building understanding and trust within and across institutions. The Bank has also learned
that a comprehensive, multidimensional and integrated approach to priority issues i s essential.
This can help ensure that trade-offs are properly identified, that broader economic and political
considerations are taken into account, and that benefits are reaped while minimizing the
possibilities for negative impacts.

22.     Donors need to support regional efforts and institutional arrangements that are owned
by the concerned governments, and will be sustained over time. When worlung in the context
of very complex issues and weak institutional frameworks, donors need to pool their resources,
build on each others' comparative advantages, and work as one team with governments and
regional organizations. Donors also need to make a commitment to remain engaged for the long-
term as regional programs, though ultimately more efficient, take more time up-front given the
many players and the need to balance individual country needs with regional needs.
Stakeholders beyond the government, including the private sector, civil society and communities,
also need to be involved in the process, and there should be openness, transparency and good
communications in this regard.     Openness and good communications are essential to better
project and program design, as well as to better understanding of complex issues by local and
global civil society.

23.     Technical support, as well       as support for        investments, is critical during
implementation. Following the analytical work with technical support for the implementation
phase has proved to be critical to the eventual success of the implementation of regional
agreements.      Finally, the World Bank needs to have in place appropriate institutional
arrangements for coordinating regional programs and ensuring consistency with country
programs. The Bank has established a cross-country Mekong team to support implementation of
this strategy.

24.     This proposed World Bank program is the result of feedback from stakeholders and
careful analysis of the World Bank's comparative advantages-its           analytical capabilities;
objectivity and willingness to weigh in on discussions of sensitive policy issues; access to
global knowledge and experience; staff expertise; financial resources; and ongoing cross-
country work in water and power. In implementing the GMS strategy, the World Bank will
need to pay particular attention to a number of critical issues. First, strong linkages will be
needed between the proposed regional strategy and each of the participating country-level
programs. Second, there will need to be a strong emphasis on external communications. Third,
the World Bank will need to continue to deepen existing regional, multi-lateral and bi-lateral
partnerships. Finally, the World Bank will need to ensure cross sectoral and cross country team
work.

   11. WORLDBANK'S           APPROACH        TOWARD         SUPPORTING THEGMSPOWERTRADEPROGRAM

 A.         THE CASEFORA GMS REGIONALENERGYMARKET (REM)

 Rationale

 25.       Three factors provide the rationale for power trade in the GMS and the development of
 an integrated regional transmission network, with its attendant economic and technical benefits:
 (i)balance (or rather imbalance) between potentialpower generation resources andforecasted
 demand within the GMS countries (in Thailand generation needs exceed resources, in Vietnam
 rapidly growing demand requires increasing the level of imports, and in Lao PDR, Myanmar,
 Southern China and Cambodia potential resources exceed forecasted demand); (ii)the
 availability of economic hydropower and coal in the resource-rich countries that justifies export;
 and (iii)    the proximity and congruity (multiplicity of borders) of the GMS countries which make
 economic cross-country power interconnections and trade feasible. Key benefits of power trade
 would include:

           Enhanced security of supply through sharing reserves and reduced dependence on energy
            imports from outside the region;
            Optimum development of the region's available energy resources;
           Feasibility of exploiting economies of scale in generation in small system, such as Lao
           PDR, Cambodia and possibly Myanmar, through development of large export-oriented
           projects and utilizing a part of their capacity for domestic use - in those countries the


                                                                 28

       availability of economic electricity would accelerate economic growth and provide an
       impetus to the development of the national transmission system;
       Optimization of investments in power systems consequent to better daily and seasonal
       matching of supply and demand and                   reduction in operational reserve capacity
       requirements in each system;
       Possible environmental benefits through the displacement of fossil-fuel thermal
       generation with renewable resource-based power (predominantly hydropower);
       Possibility of economic development (in the early years) of the remote border areas of
       some countries through small scale cross border power transfers - e.g. Cambodia (from
       Lao PDR, Vietnam and Thailand), Lao PDR (from Thailand and South China) and
       Vietnam (from South China); and
       Lower electricity prices and increased price stability (moving to an interconnected
       regional grid and an ultimate regional market) fostered by access to lower cost generation
        in another        countries    and      eventually     competition      between       producers    and
        distributors/retailers and eligible customers within and across national borders. Such a
        market, if designed efficiently and adapted to GMS characteristics, would be a buffer to
        short-term supply shocks in the current era of rising oil prices.

Quantifying the Benefits of Power Trade

26.     Several studies have quantified the benefits of power trade in the GMS. One study that
compared the scenarios of "minimal electricity trade" with one of "full scale electricity trade"
concluded that full trade could yield cost savings of at least US$10 billion over the next fifteen
years, and a reduction of airborne pollutants valued at U S $120 million a year4. It i s also
estimated that for "extended cooperation" scenarios, cost savings for network development
alone, range from $0.9 to $1.3 billion in the period 2005-20.5

27.     One significant study has been the 2002 ADB-sponsored Indicative Master Plan for
Power Interconnection in the GMS Countries`, which laid the foundations for the technical and
economic viability of the GMS interconnected grid. The Study assessed whether it would be
more beneficial to develop the power systems of these countries independently or in concert.
Key findings of the Study are given below:

        Potential reduction of peak requirements of around 2.5% due to interconnection and the
        resultingreduction in generation capacity to meet coincident peak demand;
        Displacement of investment in about 10,400 MW of gas and coal fired capacity by 8,900
        MW of hydropower and an overall capacity reduction of 1,400 MW by the year 2020.'

   0 Higher use of hydropower resources leading to reduced thermal generation development
     - resulting in PV of savings of about US$140 million, evaluated in terms of avoided costs
     of open cycle gas turbines;
   0 Reduced "operating"      (spinning) reserve total costs of about 3% -        due to (i)
     interconnection allowing trading of operating reserves across borders or mutual reserve
     sharing; and (ii)increase in hydropower reserves;
   0 Reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions - The present value of savings due to
     reduced C 0 2 emissions of about US$410 million (no allowance being made for GHG
     emissions from hydropower reservoirs, on the premise that the cost of US$S/ton of C 0 2
     savings assumedbeing already much lower than prevailing values).

B.   Key Demand-SupplyIssuesinthe Region

28.  Country-wise, the key demand-supply issues are summarized below:


   0 Thailand - Over the next decade, Thailand would need capacity augmentation of almost
    20,000 MW (entailing an annual investment in the electricity sector of about US$3
    billion), in spite of active Demand Side Management (DSM). Its natural gas resources
    (augmented by piped gas imports from Myanmar and Malaysia) would have been already
    committed; its lignite deposits have high sulfur content and are thus environmentally
    detrimental, while development of hydropower has been discontinued on environmental
    grounds. Its main options are to expand imported coal-based generation (against stiff
    public opposition), import LNG for firing in combined cycle plants or increase electricity
    imports from neighbors like Lao PDR and South China in the medium term and Myanmar
    and Cambodia in the long term.

   0  Vietnam With its burgeoning demand, which grew by almost 15% per annum between
               -
    2001 and 2004, Vietnam will need to increase its electricity generation capacity over
    15,000 MW between 2006 and 2010. Demand i s expected to continue to grow at around
    15% per year until 2010, and then taper to 11% until 2015. The investment requirements
    for the electricity sector are estimated at about US$2 billion per annum over the next
    decade. Under the power master plan studies, the country has assessed and incorporated
    imports, which will be least-cost, from GMS (mainly from South China, and new
    hydropower in Lao PDR) to supply the projected demand. In addition to the benefit of
    importing low-cost energy, power trade for Vietnam would also mean diversification of its
    generation base.
     South China - The area served by China Southern Power Grid Corporation (CSG) has
    also experienced rapid demand growth over the last decade and suffered a peak power
    shortfall of 9.4 GW in 2005. In the next five years CSG plans to invest about US$ 28.9
    billion in the electricity sector in augmenting capacity to 164 GW from 64 GW. CSG i s
    currently selling electricity to Vietnam and Lao PDR, supplying border towns in an "island
    mode". It i s working with its counterparts in Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Lao PDR
    for possible large regional interconnections. Two projects under consideration are Extra
    HighVoltage (EHV) AC or HVDC interconnections: (i)        between the CSG grid and EGAT
    grid in Thailand via Lao PDR; and (ii)  between the CSG grid and the Vietnam grid. These
    projects are predominantly oriented towards export of large blocks (in the order of 3,000

    MW) from CSG to each of the two countries, but should in the long run facilitate trading
     (imports and exports) between the parties.
      Lao PDR
    MW)     *      -Lao  PDR's natural resources, predominantly hydropower (potentially 25,000
               far exceeds its electricity needs over the next couple of decades. The current state
     of hydropower development inLao PDR comprises: (i)                   Existing - 662 MW (of which 360
    MW privately owned); (ii)Under Construction (IPPs) - 2,025 MW; (iii)Under Active
    Development (IPPs) - 2,053 MW for Thailand and 823 MW for Vietnam; and (iv) Under
    Preparation (IPPs) - 2,628 MW of which China (943 MW); Vietnam (966 MW); Thailand
     (269 MW); Cambodia (220 MW); and Lao PDR itself (230 MW). Lao PDR would thus be
     tapping only about 30% of its hydropower potential over the next decade and, considering
     the low rate of national demand growth, it will have surplus potential for export far into
     the future. However, hydropower sites would become increasingly more expensive to
     develop and their exploitation would depend upon the tariffs that major importing
     countries like Thailand and Vietnam could bear in the future. Lao PDR i s also actively
     engaged in expanding and interconnecting its isolated area networks, which would enable
     it to optimize utilization of its hydropower potential, albeit its development for exports.

       Cambodia - Cambodia has a large yet unexploited hydropower potential theoretically
     estimated at around 10,000 MW, its fossil fuel resources (offshore-gas and coal) are yet to
     be properly assessed and developed. The absence of a national interconnected grid and
     low level of access and demand makes it difficult to exploit economies of scale in
     generation; with the result that its provinces are electrified through isolated costly diesel
     based electricity. Small quanta of imports from Vietnam and Thailand provide economic
     supplies to border towns. In the near-medium term Cambodia would need to develop
     medium scale hydropower plants, coal fired plants near the shore using imported coal and
     expand electricity imports from Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam. Simultaneously and
     urgently it would need to develop a national grid, which alone would enable it to
     progressively phase out diesel generation. In the longer term, Cambodia could be in a
     position to export electricity to the region (Thailand and Vietnam) from large scale
     hydropower plants.

       Myanmar      -  Myanmar i s characterized by very low energy utilization and installed
     generation capacity, with only about 5% of its population having access to electricity, and
     per capita electricity consumption of 108 KWh - one of the lowest in the world. Demand
     grows at about 100 MW per year, or just over 8%. With its abundant energy resources,
     Myanmar i s likely to become a significant energy exporter in the GMS region. The
     country's hydropower resources are particularly attractive especially for larger export-
     oriented projects.




'* Coal outcrops have been spotted but not yet exploited, while no oil or gas reserves have been found so far
   An additional 1,600 MW Lignite-fired generation is also inthe works.

C.      ISSUES AND CHALLENGESCONCERNINGPOWER TRADE INTHE GMS

29.     Substantial groundwork has been laid for the development of the GMS Regional
Electricity Market (GMS-REM),and there i s a strong interest to move forward. However, many
issues need to be addressed before concrete results in terms of efficient "power trading" and
actual power market can be achieved. Key challenges and issues to be addressed are:

   (I)Regional Integrated Planning. Foremost among the challenges is the needto imbibea
        culture of Regional Integrated Planning - both, in the development of the power systems
        of each GMS member and in the evolution of the GMS regional transmission grid as a
        whole. Efforts towards evolving an "Agreed" (rather than an "Indicative") Regional
        Master Plan for Power Development, that would address some of the aforementioned
        shortcomings, and align regional and national plans arejust being put under way.
    (2) Znterconnecting Disparate Power Systems. The levels of development, in terms of
        extent of power infrastructure and its technical and reliability standards are different in
        each GMS country.      The challenge of harmonizing these differences by enforcing
        minimum transmission (and system operation) performance standards, through a
        performance standards study for each GMS member has initiated. This will later be
        followed by the development of a Regional Grid Code, including Performance Standards
        and operational procedures for interconnections, to be enforced in the second stage of the
        regional market moving to grid-to-grid interconnection and synchronized operation.
    (3) Regulatory Reforms. Regulatory explicit frameworks in most GMS countries are at
        preliminary stages of development. A basic minimum set of regulatory principles i s
        required to enable third party use of regional transmission systems and interconnections
        and increase the volume and opportunities of trading, - for example transmission network
        access and pricing, congestion management and dispute resolution - need to be designed
        and implemented to facilitate an enabling efficient framework for a regional investment
        perspective in the longer term.
    (4) Sector Reforms. While there i s a substantial degree of awareness for sector reforms,
        implementation record in the GMS countries i s uneven. Certain minimum prerequisites
        of an open and non-discriminatory market, like unbundling of the activities in the
        electricity industry, mainly transmission and system operation from generation, need to
        be fostered and progressed as a longer term objective.
    (5) Organizations and Rules for Market Operation. Substantial analytical work has been
        done in defining organizations that would operate the GMS Market and draft Power
        Trade Operational Agreement (PTOA), standards and protocols that would underpin its
        operations. The real challenge i s to develop further the proposals and convert rules and
        standards into operation, a painstakingtask that i s about to begin.
    (6) Consistency of Bilateral Transactions with Regional Market Needs. Currently, off-
        takers may exercise monopsony (a market condition that exists when there i s only one
        buyer) power in bilateral deals, which unless properly managed from start, could lead to
        the risk that such transactions conflict with and consequently hinder the longer-term
        development of an efficient power trade market in the region.




                                                32

    (7) Developing Consensus and Ensuring Sustainability. Through each stage of market
        development, an overall challenge i s to develop consensus among government agencies
        and participants on the enabling framework. Finally, the greatest challenge i s to ensure
        continued support and thrust of the governments towards development of the GMS
        Market and to ensure the sustainability of the institutional framework at the regional and
        national levels, in terms of capacity, staff and funding.
    (8) Developing an Agreed Implementation Road Map. To bring about a consensus for a
        phased implementation and mechanisms for regular monitoring and mid-course
        corrections, a road map for the medium-term, with steps and work plan, needs to be
        agreed among the GMS members and implemented.

D.      CAS Framework

30.     Both GMS-PT (Cambodia) and GMS-PT (Laos) projects are consistent with the
respective 2005 CASs. For Cambodia, the proposed project supports CAS objectives as well as
the National Strategic Development Plan (2006-2010) of "improving infrastructure to promote
private sector investments, and to help achieve CMDGs (Cambodia has less than 15% access rate
for electricity) through continued assistance to rural electrification, least-cost power supply and
through GMS power trade initiatives (e.g. cross-border interconnections)".         For Laos, in line
with the main objective of the government's National Growth and Poverty Eradiation Strategy
and the existing CAS, the proposed project will support "sustained growth through improved
management of the key drivers- regional integration and private sector development, rural
development, and natural resources management (CAS Objective 1)".

            GREATER MEKONG SUBREGION POWER TRADE PROJECTS



Introduction

The GMS-PT Project conforms to IDA'SGMS two-pronged strategy to support: (a) investments
in infrastructure associated with economical bilateral power exchanges between the GMS
countries; and (b) technical assistance for the conceptual formulation, detailed design and
ultimately the realization of a GMS grid and a GMS Power Market. Designed in this context of
early development of the GMS grid, the proposed Project would bring significant benefits,
through low cost electrification, to the provincial areas of Cambodia and Laos, currently sparsely
electrified by unaffordable diesel-fired generation. Additionally, the Laos project would lay the
foundations for a Communication Network, a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) System for national and regional load dispatching, so vital for economic operation of
the electricity network of Lao PDR, per se and vis-&vis the GMS grid. Geographically, the
Project involves three GMS countries - Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam - Cambodia i s the
"recipient" of power and Lao PDR and Vietnam the "suppliers".

GMS-PT (Cambodia) Project, to be executed by Cambodia, includes construction of 115 kV
cross-border transmission lines and associated substations for Cambodia to import power from
Lao PDR and Vietnam.

Power Company 2 (PC2) of Vietnam would implement the transmission line for interconnection
with Cambodia up to the Vietnam border through the ongoing SEER ($225 million, FY 2002,
Cr. 3680-VN).

GMS-PT (Laos) Project, to be executed by Lao PDR, includes: (i)construction of 115 kV
transmission lines to export power to Cambodia and part of a transmission system that will link
Thailand, Lao PDR, and Cambodia through Southern Laos, while supplying electricity to the
province of Saravan; (ii) feasibility study of Houay Lamphan Gnai Hydroelectric Project and (iii)
feasibility study and staged construction and commissioning of a modem load dispatch center.

GMS-PT (Cambodia)Project

The Project has four Components (C-1 to C-4) whose costs, financing and implementing
agencies are summarized in Table 1. A brief description of the Components i s presented below:

(a) Component C-1: 115 kV TransmissionSystem: Vietnam border to KampongCham:
   This component would facilitate import of power'" from the south of Vietnam to the
   Province of Kampong Cham in Cambodia. It would help displace the current costly and
    sparse diesel-fuel-based generation by reasonably priced electricity, fostering demand growth
    and economic development in one of Cambodia's important provinces. It would involve
    construction of: (i)a 115 kV double-circuit (240 sq mm ACSR conductor and Optical Fiber
    Earth Wire), 64 km long, predominantly pole-mounted transmission line, having a firm
    capacity of about 90 MVA, constructed from the supply point at the Vietnam border (Tan
    Bien located in Vietnam); (ii)     a 115/22 kV, 2x20 MVA Substation in Kampong Cham; (iii)                     a
    115/22 kV, 2x15 MVA Substation, en route, at Suong - to supply the rapidly growing
    demand of the district of Suong; and (iv) a 115/22 kV, 2x10 MVA Substation, also en route,
    at Kraek - to supply the rapidly growing demand of the district of Kraek. This Component i s
    supported by detailed technical, economic, environmental and social impact studies carried
    out by Consultants under an IDA-managed PHRD Grant (PHRD Grant Number TF05504l).

   based generation by reasonably priced electricity, fostering demand growth and economic
    development in Stung Treng, which i s one of the regional hub-areas earmarked by the RGC
    for rapid development. I t would involve construction of: (i) 115 kV double-circuit (240 sq
                                                                              a

(a) Component L-1: 115 kV Transmission System: Ban Hat Substation to Lao PDR-
   Border: This Component would finance investments in Lao PDR to complete the 115 kV
   Transmission System for supply of surplus hydro power from the South of Lao PDR (see
   footnote 8) to the Province of Stung Treng in Cambodia. It would involve construction of:
    (i)115kVdouble-circuit(240sqmmACSRconductorandOpticalFiberEarthWire), 25
       a
   km-long, predominantly lattice tower-mounted transmission line, having a firm capacity of
    about 90 MVA, from Ban Hat Substation to the Lao PDR border (at Veun Kham); and (ii)
    two 115 kV switching bays at Ban Hat Substation. This Component i s supported by detailed
   technical, economic, environmental and social impact studies carried out by Consultants
    underPHRDGrant (PHRDGrant Number: TF054626).
(b) Component L-2: 115 kV Transmission System: Xeset Substation to Saravan: This
    Component constitutes a link in the 115 kV Transmission System that would around 2010 or
    thereabouts interconnect Thailand, Laos and Cambodia in southern Lao PDR, through
   connecting Xekong Substation, Saravan Substation, Xeset Substation and Ban Jianxi
    Substation. While implementation of this link strictly from the view point of completing the
    aforementioned transmission system could be deferred by about two years, its early
    implementation under the proposed Project i s justified on its own merits, as it would enable
    supply of rapidly growing demand (and thereby economic development of the rural areas) of
    the province of Saravan, through least cost power supply at 115 kV. It would involve
    construction of: (i)a 115 kV double-circuit (240 sq mm ACSR conductor and Optical Fiber
    Earth Wire), 25 km-long, lattice steel tower mounted line of about 90 MVA firm capacity;

   (ii)a115/22kV,2x20MVA SubstationatSaravan,inclusiveof22kVswitchingbays; and
   (iii)two 115 kV switching bays at the existing Xeset Substation.                     This Component is
   supported by detailed technical, economic, environmental and social impact studies carried
   out by Consultants under the aforementioned PHRD Grant TF054626.
   Component L-3: Activities to Facilitate Implementation of L-1and L-2: I t has the
   following sub-components:
       Sub-Component L-3.1: Consulting Services: Proiect Design and Management for
       Components L-1 and L-2: While basic designs for the Transmission Lines and
       Substations and the Bidding Documents have been prepared by Consultants under the
       aforementioned PHRD Grant TF054626, limitedconsulting assistance through individual
       experts (about 10 staff-months) would be provided under the proposed Project to assist
       EdL in bid evaluation, contract finalization and subsequent management of the two
       Single Responsibility Supply and Install Contracts proposed for Components L-landL-2.
       Sub-Component L-3.2: Mitigation of Social and Environmental Impacts for
       Components L-1and L-2: For details of this component refer to Annex 10: Safeguard
       Policy Issues.
       Sub-Component L-3.3; Vehicles, Computers and Office Equipment:                                 This sub-
       component i s of vital importance to strengthen the capabilities of EdL in executing the
       Project. For details, see Procurement Plan, Annex 8.
(d) Component L-4: LDC (including Consulting Services): Currently Lao PDR does not
   have a L D C for load dispatching, and dispatch of it hydropower generations i s rather
   primitive, mainly through phone calls and manual operations. Its IPP hydropower plants,
   equipped with SCADA systems, are dispatched by EGAT12. Over the next few years, EdL
    would be interconnecting its four independent area power grids, developing IPP (export as
    also domestic) hydropower projects and significant HV/EHV interconnections with
   neighboring countries of Thailand, Vietnam, South China and Cambodia. In fact Lao PDR,
    with its vast hydropower potential, would be a "generation" hub for the GMS. Under these
   circumstances, it i s imperative that Lao PDR implements as quickly as possible a modern
   Load Dispatch System, comprising both National and Regional Load Dispatch Centers. This
    has been confirmed by a pre-feasibility study for Load Dispatch Centers recently
    accomplished by Consultants under PHRD Grant TF0.54626. While LDCs (both "soft" and
    "hard") will improve the quality of domestic supply, it is, from a regional perspective,
    essential for bringing: (i)     voltage and frequency control; (ii)system protection; and (iii)
    technical information exchange for dispatching in Lao PDR up to the minimum standards
    required for security of the grids in neighboring countries that are connected, or will be
    connected to EdL's grid. B y doing so, both the security of a future integrated GMS power
    grid and EdL's participation inregionalpower trade would be enhanced.
    This Component provides for: (i)        Consulting Study for detailed feasibility and design of the
    Load Dispatch System and subsequently, (ii)based on priorities identified and co-financing




12  Inaddition, the power grids of EdLare also interconnected with EGAT grids at several points that facilitate
    exchange of power both ways.

   available, staged construction of the L D C as appropriate, including the associated buildings
   (likely to be existing ones), and SCADA systems and communication fa~ilities'~.
(e) Component L-5: Feasibilitv Studv: Houav Lamphan Gnai Hydropower Project: This
   i s a priority project (65 MW, 300 GWh p.a.) of GoL, forming part of a group of hydropower
   projects in Southern Lao PDR, which are proposed to be developed and interconnected for
   export and domestic use.           Consultants financed through PHRD Grant TF054626 have
    prepared a pre-feasibility study of the project and have short-listed two options with
   parameters of: (i)generation cost of about 3.0 USc/kWh and resettlement of about 960
   persons; and (ii)generation cost of about 3.4 USc/kWh and no resettlement. This Project
    Component would advance the preparation of the hydropower project to feasibility stage.
    The outcome of the study would underpin future project financing and implementation.
(f) Component: L-6; TA for Collector Substation System: Lao PDR has a large number of
    potential hydropower projects that could be developed for export to Thailand and Vietnam.
    In the past it has been the practice for IPP developers (for the Thai Power Market) to
    construct individual hydropower projects (Nam Theun 2, Theun Hinbun, Houay Ho) and use
    dedicated transmission lines from the project to the receiving substations in Thailand. With
    more extensive development of hydropower projects, foreseen in the coming years, a need i s
    felt for clustering hydropower stations into suitable groups and collecting their outputs at
    substations located in Lao PDR, for eventual transmission to other countries. This type of
    arrangement, it i s believed, would provide technical and economical benefits per se, and also
    facilitate the application of broader economic principles of developing a GMS Grid and a
    GMS Power Market. Such an arrangement would, however, need careful consideration of
    commercial/ownership, financing, pricing, etc. issues.            This Project Component would
    provide TA of about twenty staff-months for this purpose.
(g) Component: L-7: T A for Updating Tariff Studv: The current Tariff Study for EdL is
    over three years old. Under a rapidly changing investment scenario, where EdL i s being
    increasingly mandated by GoL to undertake investments in hydropower projects, the tariff
    study needs to be updated taking into account, especially, the impact of exporthmport tariffs
    on EdL's performance. The TA would help EdL in developing suitable financial models for
    undertaking such studies on its own in future




l3  Depending on the estimated cost, further funding may be required.

             GREATER MEKONG SUBREGION POWER TRADE PROJECTS

Summary of the FinancialManagementAssessment

Assessment of the project's financial management arrangements following BP/OP 10.02 have
been conducted during project preparation and pre-appraisal missions.                        The financial
management (FM) and disbursement arrangements vary between the two countries due to
different implementation arrangements and country/local conditions. The FM arrangements in
each country are considered adequate to meet the minimumrequirements of the Bank, provided
the FMAction Plan i s implemented.

RiskAnalysis

In both countries, in general project risks are considered high due to the weak financial control
environment and systems of the public sector. However, because both agencies are familiar with
Bank requirementsand are commercially oriented and have good previous FMperformance, the
risk of this project i s Modest to High. The risks would be further mitigated by: appointment of
qualified staff, further training of staff in Bank procedures, regular independent audits and Bank
supervision. After mitigation, the FMrisks are considered Modest for both countries.

The tables below described the risks and the risk mitigation measures.

accounts. The assistance and guidance will also be available from the FM Consultant recruited
under the REP Iproject. Extensive training on Bank operations will be provided by Bank staff
duringthe Project launch workshop.

&L:    The designated Project Accountant will be responsible for project accounts for EdL
components by using recently installed AFMS accounting system. The EdL Project Accountant,
at the end of the year, will also prepare the consolidated Project Financial Statements for all
components implemented in Lao PDR (for both EdL and MEM),and have them audited by an
independent auditor separately from regular EdLCorporate Financial Statements.

Accounting Policies and Procedures

The project's accounts and records would be maintained in accordance with acceptable
accounting standards and practices and with government regulations and procedures.

No separate accounting manual would be prepared for the proposed projects. For GMS-PT
(Cambodia) the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and the Financial Management Manual
(FMM)recently introducedby MEFwill be followed and appliedby EDC. For GMS-PT (Laos)
the financial management manual currently adopted by ongoing REP Phase Iproject will be
followed and applied by EdL and MEM. Each implementing agency will prepare and submit
their annual financial statements and audit reports of external auditors.

FundsFlow and DesignatedAccount

For each project, there will be only one Designated Account (DA) denominated in U S dollars
that will be established with terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. EDC will open the
account at a commercial bank for payment of project expenditures incurred by EDC. The
Recipient will open the DA at the Bank of Lao PDR for project expenditures incurred by both
EdL and MEM. The DAs, which will cover the IDA share of eligible expenditures in all



                                                52

disbursement categories, will have the authorized allocation as specified below. Application for
replenishment of the DA, supported by appropriate documentation, would be made on the basis
of Statements of Expenditures and Summary Sheets and submitted to the Bank monthly or when
the amount withdrawn equals 20% of the authorized allocation, whichever comes first.
Payments from the DA are to be made for the Bank's share of the project's eligible expenditures,
in accordance with the respective Grant Agreements.

IDA Grants will be provided to RGC and GoL. RGC and GoL will on-lend the Grant proceeds
to EDC and EdL under separate Subsidiary Agreements. IDA funds will be channeled either
through the DA or through direct payments for project expenditures. EDC and EdL counterpart
funds will be channeled through normal EDC and EdL payment procedures. The counterpart
funds would be about US$1.7 million for EDC and about US$1.8 million for EdL.

In Cambodia. The EDC DA will have an authorized allocation of US$0.75m. At least two
signatures are required for withdrawal from the DA.

In Lao PDR. The EdL DA will have an authorized allocation of US$0.75m. At least two
signatures are required for withdrawal from the DA. No DA will be maintainedby MEM,as all
disbursements will be done via direct payments to the consultants.

Reportingand Monitoring

Requiredreports from each implementing agency include: (i)InterimFinancial Reports (IFRs)-
prepared separately by each IA; (ii)Annual audited Project Financial Statements - for EDC and
consolidated one for EdL and MEM; and (iii)     Annual audited Corporate Financial Statements -
for EDC andEdL.

The interim financial reports (IFRs) are required to be submitted quarterly within 45 days after
the end of each quarter. As the IFRs will also be used as a monitoring tool, it should report
project progress with adequate description and explanation and analysis of variances. The IFRs
will not be subject to audit. The formats of the IFRs have been agreed at negotiation.

The annual financial statements are subject to annual audit by an external auditor. The audit will
be carried out with greater emphasis on internal controls, according to a TOR acceptable to the
Bank. The audited financial statements and audit reports are required to be submitted to the
Bank within six months after the end of each fiscal year. The format of the annual financial
statements will be similar to the IFRs. Internal audit reports will be made available to the Bank's
supervision missions for review.

"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004; and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreements. The general descriptions of various
items under different expenditure category are described below. For each contract to be financed
by the IDA Grant, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need
for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed
between the Recipient and the Bank project team in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement
Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation
needs and improvements in institutional capacity. Guidance for implementing the procurement
provisions i s provided in the Procurement Manual specified in the Kingdom of Cambodia's Sub-
Decree No. 14 dated February 26, 2007 on Promulgating of the Standard Procedures for
Implementing the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank Assisted Projects.

Procurement of Goods and Works: Goods procured under this project would primarily
include: power transmission lines, substations, computer and software, office equipment and
vehicles.  All goods packages shall be procured through International Competitive Bidding
(ICB). For transmission lines and substations, the procurement will be generally done on a
supply and installation contract which would include concrete structures, installation and
erections related to the power transmission systems. All packages of supply and installation
contracts shall be procured using IDA'Slatest Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for Supply &
Installation of Plant and Equipment. For procurement of computer hardware and software, office
equipment and vehicles under ICB method, the latest Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for
Procurement of Goods shall be used. Small valued goods under contracts below US$20,000
each may be procured using the shopping procedure in accordance with paragraph 3.5 of the
Bank's Procurement Guidelines.

Selection of Consultants:         Consultant services are expected in the following areas:
implementation management of the physical components; institutional strengthening of EDC,
strengthening of EDC internal auditing capacity and construction supervision of Transmission
Lines and Substations. These services would be procured mostly through Quality and Cost
Based Selection (QCBS) or Quality Based Selection (QBS). If applicable, Selection Based on
Consultants' Qualifications (CQS) may be used for consulting services estimated to cost less
than $50,000. If warranted, short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than
$100,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines. Individual




                                              56

consultants may be selected in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 5.1-5.4 of the
Consultant Guidelines.

Operational Costs: A limited amount of incremental operating cost will be financed by the
project to supplement EDC's counterpart funds for project management. Such costs would be
incurred in line with EDC's administrative procedures which were reviewed and found
acceptable to the Association.

B.     Assessment of the Agency's Capacitv to Implement Procurement

The procurement activities will be undertaken mainly by the Cambodia's electric power utility,
Electricite du Cambodge (EDC). EDC has already set up its own Project Management Unit
(PMU) for World Bank, Rural Electrification and Transmission Project and staffed with one
procurement officer.      This procurement staff will serve as EDC's focal person for all
procurement matters under GMS Power Trade Project. A Procurement Agent (PA) will be
contracted by MEF to carryout, on behalf of the respective project implementing agencies,
procurement for all IDA-funded projects in the country including the proposed GMS project. A
Project Implementation Consultant (PIC) will be recruited by the Procurement Agent (PA) to
assist EDC in project management, in providing technical inputs for procurement, and in
supervision of construction after the PA has been selected and has commenced its services. The
PA i s expected to take the primary responsibility throughout the procurement process (from
preparation of bidding documents until having the contracts ready for signature) while EDC
(with the assistance of its PIC) will provide technical inputs during the procurement process and
will be responsible for subsequent contract administration and execution. A matrix at the end of
this section provides detailed division of responsibilities between PA, EDC, and PIC.

An assessment of the capacity of the Implementing Agency (EDC) to implement procurement
actions for the project has been carried out as part of the project preparation and appraisal. The
assessments reviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project and full reports
are available in the project files.

The main procurement related issues and risks identified include: interfacing and coordinating
issues related to the transmission line crossing both Laos and Cambodia, quality of technical
specifications, procurement delays, and the fiduciary risk in the broader country context. To
mitigate such risks, the following measures have been agreed: (a) international consultants
would be retained to help with the technical detailed designs and specifications and to coordinate
with the PA during the procurement process; (b) single responsibility supply and installation
contract arrangement (rather than small packages) will be adopted for almost all of the physical
investment components; (c) for the transmission line crossing Laos and Cambodia, two separate
yet parallel bidding processes will be conducted by the two countries based on properly
coordinated implementation schedules; to this end, a Coordination Committee has been
established jointly by the two countries; (d) the procurement process will be carried out, on
behalf of EDC, by the Procurement Agent to be contracted by MEF; (e) all goods procured to be
done through ICB; and (f) appropriate procurement planning and scheduling and close
coordination among the implementing agencies of the two countries, the PA                 and the
Association, as well as all prior review contracts and more frequent supervision and follow up by
the Association.



                                               57

In addition, EDC will follow good governance practices in handling procurement processes,
including but not limited to the following: (a) enhancing transparency through greater public
disclosure of procurement related information (such as procurement plans, bidding documents
and RFPs, consultant longlists and shortlists, and contract awards, etc.); and (b) complying with
the procurement complaint handling procedures and sanction requirements as set forth in the
existing Government procurement rules and regulations.

The overall project risk for procurement is rated as "high" for EDC. The high rating for EDC i s
mainly due to the perceived country risk in Cambodia.

  C.      Procurement Plan

  The implementing agency (EDC) developed a Procurement Plan for their project which provides
  the basis for the procurement methods. The Plan has been agreed between the implementing
  agency and the Project Team during the appraisal mission in March 2007 and i s available at
  EDC's P M U Office. The Procurement Plan will also be available in the Project's database and
  in the Association's external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with
  the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and
  improvements in institutional capacity.

  D.      Frequency of Procurement Supervision

  All ICB contracts are subject to prior review, for which the review, monitoring and supervision
  will be carried out from the Bank offices (in the headquarters and Thailand) on a regular basis.
  In addition, procurement supervision and post review will be conducted as part of the regular
  project supervision missions at least twice per year. Furthermore, the designated procurement
  specialist based in Thailand would visit Cambodia periodically, and also other procurement staff
  based in the Bank's Cambodia Office will provide additional support when needed.

Annex 8B. GMS Power Trade (LaoPDR)

A.       General

Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines:            Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004; and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreements. For procurement based on NCB
(not expected at the time of appraisal) and Shopping, the prevailing Government Procurement
Decree and the associated Implementation Rules and Regulations will be followed. The general
descriptions of various items under different expenditure category are described below. For each
contract to be financed by the IDA Grant, the different procurement methods or consultant
selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and
time frame are agreed between the Recipient and the IDA project team in the Procurement Plan.
The Procurement Plan will be updated annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.




                                                                        61

Procurementof Works: Works to be procured under this Project would include: civil works
and installation/erection services required for construction of transmission lines, substations and
load dispatch centers. The procurement of works will be done on a supply and installation basis,
following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures and using the IDA'S latest
Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for Supply & Installation of Plant and Equipment. For the
load dispatch centers, construction of the associated building(s) may be separated out as
standalone works package(s); the final decision will be made during the project implementation
once the technical details are prepared by the international consultants to be selected.

Procurement of Goods: Goods to be procured under this project would primarily include:
power transmission lines, substations, and load dispatch centers.         As indicated above, the
procurement will be done through supply and installation arrangements following ICB
procedures. In addition, the implementing agency would need some field work vehicles and
office equipment to facilitate the project implementation. The field work vehicles will be
procured following ICB procedures based on the IDA'Slatest SBD for Procurement of Goods,
while the office equipment will be purchased following Shopping procedures.

Selection of Consultants:         Consultant services are expected in the following areas:
implementation management of the physical components; feasibility studies for hydropower
projects; technical assistance for collector substation system; feasibility study, procurement and
construction supervision of load dispatch centers; and tariff study. These services would be
procured mostly through Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) or Quality Based Selection
(QBS). If applicable, Selection Based on Consultants' Qualifications (CQS) may be used for
consulting services estimated to cost less than $50,000. Individual consultants would be selected
inaccordance with the Section V of the IDA'SConsultant Guidelines. Ifwarranted, short lists of
consultants for services estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent per contract may be
composed entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of
the Consultant Guidelines.

Operational Costs: All incremental operating costs will be covered by the local counterpart
funds.

B.      Assessment of the Agency's Capacityto ImplementProcurement

The main implementing agency for the GMS Power Trade (Laos) i s EdL, the state owned
electric power utilities. EdL has set up a PMU staffed with procurement officers. International
consultants were hired to assist in feasibility studies and preparation of bidding documents.
Project Implementation Consultants (PIC) will also be hired to assist in project implementation.

Assessments of EdL's procurement capacity for the project have been carried out as part of the
project preparation and appraisal. The assessments reviewed the organizational structure for
implementingthe project and an assessment report is available in the project files.

The main procurement related issues and risks identified include: interfacing and coordinating
issues related to the transmission line crossing both Laos and Cambodia, quality of technical
specifications, and procurement delays. To mitigate these risks, the following measures have



                                               62

been agreed and adopted: (a) international consultants have been hiredto help with the technical
designs and specifications; (b) single responsibility supply and installation contract arrangement
(rather than small packages) will be adopted for the physical investment components; (c) for the
transmission line crossing Laos and Cambodia, two separate yet parallel bidding processes will
be conducted by the two countries based on properly coordinated implementation schedules; to
this end, a Coordination Committee has been established jointly by the two countries; and (d)
procurement arrangements will be based on careful planning and scheduling, advanced
procurement if possible, closer coordination between EdL and IDA, as well as more frequent
supervision and follow up by IDA (especially by the procurement specialist based in Thailand).

Agreement has been reached that IDA will help build up and strengthen EdL Planning and
Procurement Division's capacity in international procurement (this division i s used to only
handle procurement funded by EdL's own budget). EdL will set up an international procurement
team within the Division, who will be trained through external procurement courses and
seminars as well as through on-the-job training. This team i s expected to assist in procurement
underthe GMS Project.

In addition, EdL will follow good governance practices in handling procurement processes,
including but not limited to the following: (a) enhancing transparency through greater public
disclosure of procurement related information (such as procurement plans, bidding documents
and RFPs, consultant longlists and shortlists, and contract awards, etc.); and (b) complying with
the procurement complaint handling procedures and sanction requirements as set forth in the
existing Government procurement rules and regulations.

The overall project risk for procurement i s rated as "average".

C.      Procurement Plan

A Procurement Plan has been developed and agreed between EdL and the Project Team during
the appraisal mission in March 2007 and i s available at EdL's PMU Office. They will also be
available in the Project's database and in IDA'Sexternal website. The Procurement Plan will be
updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs.

D.      Frequency of Procurement Supervision

All major contracts will be subject to prior review, for which the review, monitoring and
supervision will be carried out from IDA offices (in the headquarters and Thailand) on a regular
basis. In addition, procurement supervision and post review will be conducted as part of the
regular project supervision missions at least twice per year. Furthermore, the procurement
specialists based in Thailand would visit Laos from time to time as needed.

Economic and Financial Analysis

Analyses Methodology.            Economic and financial analyses have been performed for the
following three Project Components: (i)            C-1: Import of Electricity from the border at Vietnam
to the province of Kampong Cham in Cambodia; (ii) Import of Electricity from the border
                                                                  C-2:
at Lao PDR to the province of Stung Treng in Cambodia; and (iii)                     L-2: Supply of Electricity
from the Xeset Substation in Lao PDR to the province of Saravan in Lao PDR. In regard to
component L-1which involves transport of electricity from the Ban Hat Substation in Lao PDR
to the Lao PDR border with Cambodia (from where sub-component C-2 takes over) a Financial
Internal Rate of Return, FZRR Analysis i s done to determine whether export of electricity to
Cambodia i s financially viable for Lao PDR. The economic analyses comprise two parts: (i)
Least Cost Analysis which compares the Present value, PV14of costs l5 meeting the forecast of
provincial electricity demand through a 115 kV line from a remotely located grid sub-station
with the next best alternative of meeting the same level of demand at about the same level of
reliability through progressive installation of appropriately-sized medium-speed Diesel
Generator sets, locally; and (ii)EZRR Analysis, which evaluates the Economic Internal Rate of
Return (EIRR) of the Project, i.e. the discount rate at which the PV of costs                        l6of supplying
electricity equals the PV of benefits derived by the consumers. The Financial Internal Rate of
Return, FZRR Analysis has been performed on similar lines as the EIRR Analysis", to evaluate
the Financial Internal Rate of Return of the Electricity Utilities, EDC and EdL.

Key Assumptions.          The following i s a summary of the key assumptions that underpin the
analyses:

        Parameter                                               Assumptions
Demand Forecasts             Detailed demand forecasts have been made by the Project-preparation
                             Consultants.
                             For Cambodia, the demand forecast exercise has been a major undertaking (under
                             IDA's RETP Project), including end-use field surveys and development of
                             econometric models. Four sets of forecasts have been prepared by the Consultants
                             for different GDP growth rates - Base, High, Low, and Lower Bound. For the
                             present analysis, the Lower Bound forecast has been used as a conservative
                             assumption.
                             For Lao PDR,Demand Forecasting has been well instituted under previous IDA
                             and ADB supported projects and hence the Base Case forecast prepared by GoL
                             for Saravan has been adopted for the analysis.
                             Inthe year of commissioningof the 115 kV transmission line, the demand is
                             assumedto attain 70% of the forecast value due to time lag in consumers
                             switching over electricity and new consumers coming on due to reduced tariffs.
                             Inthe second, third and fourth years, the demands are assumed to reach 80%, 90%
                             and 100% of the forecast values.
                             Key numbers for the demand forecasts are summarized inTable 4 below.

                             These numbers are very conservative in favor of diesel generation, considering
                             current diesel price of USc77/1 in Stung Treng and USc68A in Kampong Cham.

                               very conservatively assumed at USc 15/kwh. This is only about 75% of the
                               current tariff and about 150% of prospective future tariffs, which are expected to

Summary of Results"

Least Cost Analysis

The load in Saravan is currently served through an overstretched 22 kV transmission line. In
addition, the demand in Saravan i s growing rapidly. A study done by Consultants" has shown
that advancing the construction of the Xeset 1 - Saravan 115 kV line by two years to the year
2008 i s less expensive than meeting the power demand of Saravan by expanding the over-
stretched 22 kV system.         Another alternative of supplying the power needs of Saravan by
installing local diesel generator sets and forgoing the construction of the 115 kV transmission
system has also been considered inthe aforementioned Feasibility Study and i s presented below.

Results of the Least Cost Analysis are presented in Table 1for the following scenarios: (a) Base
Case I,corresponding to the base demand forecast and base capital and O&M costs for both, the
115kV transmission line and the diesel, alternatives; (b) Sensitivity Case 11, corresponding to a
scenario where the demand falls by 20%, for which: (i)the base capital and O&M costs of the
115kV transmission line (which has already been constructed) are maintained; whereas (ii)                       the
Capital, Fuel and O&M costs of the diesel alternative are reduced by 20% in tune with the
demand. The Net Present Value (NPV) of costs i s the difference between the Present Value
(PV) of Costs for the diesel alternative minus the PV of costs for the transmission line
alternative; a positive NPV value indicating that the transmission line alternative i s least cost.

Summary of Economic and Financial Analysis

Both the EIRR and FIRR analyses have been done in constant dollar terms. The EIRR does not
include any duties and taxes based on standard methodological practice that such costs do not
affect a project's economic viability as these costs are considered transfer payments. The FIRR
does include duties and taxes.

Economic Analysis (EIRR)

The results of the EIRR analyses are presented in Table 2 for:          (i)the Base Case I; (ii)
Sensitivity Case 11, with Capital and O&M Costs increased by 20%; (iii)      Sensitivity Case 111,
with Electricity Sales reduced by 20%; and (iv) Sensitivity Case IV, with Capital and O&M
Costs increased by 20% and Electricity Sales reduced by 20%.

Import Tariff from Vietnam: Sensitivity Analyses

For the EIRR analysis in the case of the Vietnam Border - Kampong Cham transmission
system, as stated in the assumptions above, the import tariff assumed in 2010 i s USc 8.5/kwh, on
the basis of weighted average tariff for three tariff slabs proposed in the tariff structure of the
draft PPA with Vietnam. If there i s an annual escalation of the import tariff (as i s currently
beingproposed in the draft PPA with Vietnam), which equals the annual inflation rate, the ERR
does not get affected. However, if the escalation rate exceeds inflation, there i s a corresponding
decrease in the economic rate of return of this component.

In order to assess the degree of risk that the Project could become economically unviable, an
additional sensitivity test was conducted in which an annual escalation rate in the import tariff
exceeds inflation by 1% (for example, inflation rate i s 4% and escalation rate i s 5%).          An
additional sensitivity test was done assuming that the gap between escalation and inflation i s 2%
(for example, inflation rate i s 3% and escalation rate i s 5%). Table 2A shows the changes in the
economic viability for these additional sensitivity tests. Under the base-case, for a tariff increase
of 2% in real terms (escalation 5%, inflation 3%), the EIRR drops from about 32% to about 26%.
For the worst case scenario, Sensitivity Case IV, the EIRR declines to about 17%, still
maintaining the economic viability of the Project.

FinancialAnalysis

The FIRR Analysis uses the same methodology as the EIRR Analysis, except that financial
 prices are used instead of economic prices. For Sub-Component C-1 the FIRRs are tested for
 threshold2' sales tariffs 11.5 and 12.0 USc/kwh, whereas for Sub-Component C-2,the FIRRs are
 tested for threshold sales tariffs of 11.0and 11.5 USc/kwh. For Sub-Component L-2 the FIRRs
 are tested for threshold sales tariffs as low as 7.5 and 7.0 USc/kwh. The aforementioned tariffs
 are expected to be well below prospective tariffs in Cambodia (where the Regulator takes into
 consideration equity issues vis-&vis other provinces which are not likely to have the benefit of
 grid based electricity for a long time to come), and very close to prospective tariff in Lao PDR.
 For Component C-1, a sensitivity analysis (on similar lines as for the EIRR) of the import tariff
 from Vietnam on the FIRR was conducted for the two scenarios of 1% and 2% annual tariff
 escalation in real terms. The results showed that for a 1%real increase, for a net present value of
 US$0.9 million, the "break-even" tariff i s about 13 USc/kwh, and for a 2% real increase, the
 break-even tariff i s about 15 USc/kwh.

 In order to assess whether selling of electricity to Cambodia is a financially viable proposition
 for EdL, an FIRR of this Project Sub-Component was evaluated taking into consideration
 investments to be made by EdL in the 115 kV transmission system from Ban Hat Substation up
 to the border with Cambodia, its operating costs, the cost of energy at Ban Hat 115 kV bus (after
 allowing for losses of 1%) evaluated at LRMC of USc5.13/kwh and a revenue of USc7.0/kwh,
 according to the PPA. The FIRR works out to 15.81%.

SUMMARY OF FINANCIALPERFORMANCEOF EDC 21

PresentFinancial Situation

Despite steep fuel prices, the year 2005 proved to be a good year for EDC. It made some notable
operating achievements in addition to the implementation of a major tariff revision: (i)Sales
increased to 872 GWh, 26% higher than the previous year; (ii)             Assets increased to Riel 588 billion;
(iii)Customer baseincreasedto 217,453, 41% over last year; (iv) DistributionlossesinPhnom
Penh progressively reduced from 25% in 1999 to 11% in 2005; and (v) Power imports from
Vietnam commenced at medium voltage in several border areas. The terms of bulk power
purchases at high voltage from Vietnam and Thailand were negotiated and finalized.                         The
construction of the 115kV transmission line inter-connecting Thailand with Cambodia in the
northwest hadcommenced.

Key Financial Issues

Fuel Prices. EDC's generation is almost exclusively based on imported petroleum fuel and IPP
purchased power, both payable in foreign currency. Thus, operating expenses are extremely
sensitive to fuel costs (which i s also a significant component of purchased power costs) and
exchange rate fluctuations. The price of crude oil increased steadily from an average of $25/barrel
at the end of FY02 to more than $65/barrel in 2005. Hence, despite EDC's increasing sales and
addition of comparatively cheaper sources of power from Kirirom Hydro and more efficient IPPs,
operating profits of R 0.8 billion in FY03 turnedto operating losses of R 31 billion in FY04.




                                                   75

Purchased Power. Although EDC i s the dominant supplier of power, IPPs provide a substantial
part of EDC's generation. As of the end of FY04, IPPs supplying to EDC account for about 48%
of EDC's installed capacity and 60% of generation. IPPs also feature in EDC's future plans and
have further power purchase agreement (PPA) contracts under discussion with potential IPPs and
joint venture partners.

Government Receivables.           Until recently, EDC's collection performance was poor.             The
implementation of Financial Recovery Action Plan (FRAP) called for a reduction in EDC's
overall accounts receivables to 2.5 months of sales and to accomplish this goal, the Government
undertook several measures concerning the arrangement for settling current and future dues and
issued instructions to government ministries and departments for timely settlement of electricity
bills within a month of billing. On March 27, 2006, the Prime Minister approved a letter
submittedby MEF that stipulated that MEF shall use the national budget to repay its overdue
debts to EDC for electricity consumption; it has been implemented thus far and government bills
are being paid. Government and EDC are implementing an Accounts Receivable Management
Action Plan requiredunder the RETProject.

Underdeveloped Electricity Supplies. Owing to the inefficient small size of generating units
 dependent on high cost imported oil, and the lack of an HV transmission grid, electricity costs are
 very high. Average grid-based tariff i s USc 16kwh (the range i s from USc 9/kwh to USc 23/kwh)
 and tariff in rural areas range from USc 30kwh to USc 90/kwh. As a measure of poverty
 alleviation, the Government plans to increase rural electricity coverage from about 10% today to
 70% by FY30. This will pose a serious financial and institutional challenge. With power demand
 expected to grow at about 15% per year, it i s critical that Cambodia looks for major sources of
 supply for meeting demand beyond FY07. In the near to medium term, import of electricity from
 neighboring countries at low tariff rates i s an appropriate choice.

 Power Sector Reform. Considerable progress has been made in reforming the power sector,
 particularly the passage of the Electricity Act in FYOl and the establishment of the Electricity
 Authority of Cambodia (EAC) as the independent regulator. EAC has undertaken crucial steps
 towards issuing licenses to larger scale generators and distributors in urban areas.           I t s next
 important task i s to formalize the operations of small-scale private operators in the rural areas. The
 regulatory framework for rural electricity operations in the country i s being developed with
 guidelines and procedures currently being drafted by EAC, with support from ADB and the Bank.
 Further strengthening of the sector structure and commercialization of EDC were identified as
 priority needs by the Bank's Cambodia Energy Sector Strategy Review and funding to address
 these i s being sought from Trust Funds or other interested donors (through the proposed Power
 Sector Efficiency Study).

 Projected Financial Performance

 Financial Outlook (FY06-10). Financial projections for FY06-12 and the resulting financial
 ratios are summarized in Table 2. Detailed assumptions of input parameters are available in the
 project files.

 On the basis of these projections and the operating target assumptions, the following financial
 covenants (similar to those for the RET Project) shall apply for the GMS Power Trade Project i.
 e.: (i)sufficient revenues to cover no less than the sum o f (a) operating; expenses; and (b) the

amount bv which debt service requirements exceed the provision for depreciation (minimum
cash requirement ratio); (ii)net revenues at the level of 1.3 times its estimated debt service
requirements (debt service cover ratio); and (iii)        no further debt if such additional debt would
raise its long-term indebtedness to more than 1.5 times its total capitalization except in FY 2009
when it should not exceed 1.7 times (debt equitv ratio).

Conclusion. EDC's financial outlook will remain fragile as high fuel prices continue to impact
operating results since automatic fuel adjustment i s not charged to the residential customers.
Unless imported fuel costs remain at their current levels and the interconnection links with
Vietnam, Thailand and Laos are commissioned on time, EDC will not be able to achieve
satisfactory financial performance in the future. To achieve cost-covering revenues, EDC would
have to maximize sales to high value customers at competitive prices, and to domestic
consumers, at prices that recover costs. In the absence of fuel-indexed tariffs to residential
consumers, foreign exchange and inflation and with tariffs being high as they already are, the
challenge for EDC i s to minimize costs. The proposed Project which calls for financing the
infrastructure for the interconnection with Vietnam, Laos and Thailand via 115 kV transmission
links is a significant first step as the neighboring countries have agreed to provide Cambodia
with supplies at prices below EDC's cost of generation.

SUMMARY OF PROJECTEDFINANCIAL PERFORMANCEOF EdL2'

EdL'sfinancial performance

EdL continues to make good progress in improving its operational efficiency, implementing
tariff adjustments, increasing rural access, and in meeting the demand growth that underpinned
the Action Plan for Financial Sustainability approved by the Government in October 2005.
Since 2001, its financial performance has been steadily improving.

However, this trend of steady improvement and financial recovery could be adversely affected
by recent trends in the Government's approach to power sector investments by significantly
increasing EdL's medium-term investment program, and using EdL as an investment vehicle for
its investment in the equity of export-oriented IPPs. In addition, the delay in implementing one
of the key measures of the Action Plan, Le., settlement of Government arrears will have an
immediate impact on EdL's profitability and cash-flows.

EdL'sFinancial Projections FY 2006-2012

Further to the financial projections developed for EdL under the ongoing Rural Electrification
Project APL-1, and the tariff study carried out three years ago that formed the basis of Action
Plan for Financial Sustainability of EdL (Action Plan), a scenario was developed by EdL for the
period of FY06-12 with the following key assumptions: (i) adjustments in accordance with
                                                              tariff
the tariff increase effective January 2007 and future tariff adjustments as per the Action Plan, (ii)
retention of dividends received from equity investments including THPC investments and
concessional loans for new rural electrification investments required during the projection
period; (iii)no cash or equity contributions from the Government; (iv) financing plan for new
investments consisting of 70-80% borrowings and the balance from internal resources; (v) future
loans at commercial rates (2-7.5% per annum); and (vi) receivables not to exceed two months of
sales. Based on this scenario, a summary of projected key indicators i s presented inTable 4:

EdL is experiencing a surge in demand, much higher than what was envisaged three years ago in
the tariff study that formed the basis of the Action Plan. At the present time, EdL's demand i s
growing in the range of 1520% and i t has an unmet demand of about 10-12%. To meet this
demand, instead of impeding economic growth, the strategy of the Government and EdL i s to
increase EdL's investment program, including in generation for domestic consumption, and
import from the neighboring countries (if transmission capacity allows). As a result of this
increased investment program, EdL i s therefore projecting an investment program higher by
about US$175 million more than what was envisaged under REP APL-1, thereby affecting its
ability to comply with the existing self-financing ratio covenant. Given a healthy debt to equity
ratio projected to be in the range of 0.6-1.0 (low gearing of its balance sheet, and an indicator of
low financial risk profile of the business), a low self-financing ratio would be acceptable as long
as EdLi s able to service its debt.

The above projections show that in the next five years EdL's financial performance will decline
for two years in 2009 and 2010 and start improving again from 2011 onwards. Because of large
amounts of debt that EdL would need to raise to finance these investments, and no equity
contribution from the Government towards these, the debt-service cover ratio will decline from
1.6 in 2008 to 1.1in 2009 but start improving thereafter. Its self-financing ratio will also drop
and remain in the range of 9-15%. This i s largely due to the high level of capital expenditures
proposed for the period. This is not an unlikely occurrence in entities experiencing rapid growth,
especially for small sized utilities such as EdL.

However, if EdL were to defer some of its investments in generation projects which may still
happen since some of these projects are at an early stage of development (survey, feasibility


                                                80

studies etc. not yet started), its need for increasing its borrowings above the level projectedin the
2004 tariff study would diminish. Assuming a delay of one year in investments in Nam Khan-2,
and undertaking of Theun Hinboun expansion project through another investment vehicle which
i s also consistent with Tariff Study, its financial performance would be as summarized in Table
5:

The Bank would, through policy dialogue, review Government's plans for investments inexport-
oriented hydropower projects, and provide necessary technical advice in selection of an
appropriate financing vehicle for these investments.

Though the Government has substantially increased bill payments/arrears adjustments to EdL, it
i s not yet in full compliance with this requirement under the Action Plan. Compared to an
average annual payment of about 20 billion Kip through 2004, the Government has paid 29
billion Kip in 2005 and 66 billion Kip in 2006. The Budget Department of the Ministry of
Finance has issueda letter to EdLfor settlement of past government arrears.

Based on the above, an agreement was reached at negotiations that EdL would meet the
following financial targets: (i)   debt-service ratio not to go below 1.3; however in 2009 and 2010,
the ratio will not be below 1.1 (ii)   debt-equity ratio not to go above 1.5, and (iii) self-financing
ratio to be above 15% except in 2009 and 2010 when it i s projectedto be in the range of 9-11%.

            GREATER MEKONG SUBREGION POWER TRADE PROJECTS

GMS-Power Trade (Cambodia)

Scope of Resettlement Impacts

The proposed GMS-PT (Cambodia) project will consist of two investment components: (i)56        a
kilometer long 115kV Transmission Line between Laos border to Stung Treng; and (ii)a 66
kilometer long 115kV Transmission Line between Kampong Cham and Vietnam border. The
construction of these two transmission lines will involve limited amount of land acquisition and
resettlement, which i s mainly caused by acquiring land for substations, building tower bases, and
clearing right of way (ROW) under the transmission lines. A RAP was prepared by EDC based
on detailed impact survey and proposed compensation policies.

According to the survey, a total 4.09 ha of land areas would be acquired including 2.1 ha for four
sub-stations and 1.99 ha for tower bases. During construction about 6 ha of land areas would be
occupied temporarily for access roads, storage site, and soil deposit/borrowing sites. Most of
these will be paddy land. About 6,400 trees will be removed and 94 small shops with 1,092
square meters of structures will be relocated within a short distance from the ROW. These two
transmission lines will affect a total of 30 villages spread over 10 communes in 3 districts of two
provinces. Most impact i s relatively minor; caused by the clearance of ROW (30m wide) and
land acquisition for tower bases. The more significant impact i s on those affected by land
acquisition for four substations (12 households) and those to be physically relocated along the
transmission alignment (94 shops), thereby affecting a total of 106 households.

Removal of 6,400 trees, including some economically valuable trees, might also have some
impacts for some affected households. Most of those are likely to be the owners of residences,
as the trees tend to be clustered around built up residential areas. In addition, during project
construction, some temporary impacts might take place either in or outside the ROW and
substation boundaries.

Socio-economic Conditions

The project areas consist mainly of rice fields in very flat terrain with scattered villages, houses
and trees. The major economic activity i s rain-fed lowland rice farming. The local economy
along the length of the ROW i s characterized by rural production and the provision of basic
goods and services. The most common primary occupation among the DPs i s farming (38% of
D P respondents) with rice providing the main source of income.

The socio-economic survey indicated that there are no ethnic minority villages along the two
transmission lines. The Bank has concluded that the Bank IPpolicy should not be triggered.




                                                 83

Objectiveand Principles

The Project's resettlement and compensation are to be in accordance with World Bank
requirements and Cambodian law.         The key objectives and principles for resettlement and
compensation are: (i)  the livelihood for DPs following the Project shall be better or at least equal
to the level before the project; (ii)
                                    compensation and resettlement shall be carried out before land
acquisition and construction; (iii)compensation shall be based on replacement value with no
deduction for depreciation, demolition or the value of salvaged materials; (iv) the preferredform
of compensation for lost land i s land of "equivalent" value; if the area of land taken i s less than
20% of total landholding, cash compensation shall be acceptable; and (v) all DPs shall be eligible
for compensation, regardless of whether they hold legal title to the land they occupy

Legal Frameworkand CompensationPolicies

Cambodian law requires that land can only be compulsorily acquired where it i s in the national
interest and that in such case fair compensation must be paid in advance. This i s consistent with
the Bank's policies, which go beyond this and have further more specific requirements.
Although Cambodian law does not recognize private ownership in certain cases, such as in
existing ROWS, this does not prevent compensation being provided to meet with the Banks'
policies, through other means than direct compensation under the law. While the individual's
rights to ownership and compensation are protected in the new Land Law, there is no clearly
defined mechanism for land acquisition and amounts of compensation. In recent Bank funded
projects, ad hoc inter-ministries committee was often set up to review and adopt compensation
rates.

In order to ensure that the affected people will be able to restore their living condition and
livelihood after resettlement, a set of compensation standards has been included in the RAP,
which was based on replacement cost survey carried out in 2006 in the project affected areas.
The proposed compensation rates in the RAP had been reviewed and endorsed by Inter-
Ministerial Resettlement Committee (IRC). For the acquired land areas, it was set at $0.75 to
$4.9 per square meter for agricultural land and $3 to $6.5 per square meters for residential land.
For relocated small shops, depending on types of structures involved, the compensation will be
set at $13 to $49 per square meter. For removed trees, compensation rates range from $5 to $35
a piece tree for different species of trees. In addition, the Project will provide various moving
and transition allowance for the project affected people, such as $40 per household for moving
allowance, $40 per household for transition assistance, and $20 per household for the vulnerable
households. These compensation rates were reviewed and approved by the Bank and endorsed
by RGC.

RehabilitationApproachesand Options

Those affected by relocation of small shops and other attachments, will be provided
compensation at replacement value. For those affected by land acquisition of tower bases under
transmission lines, due to small land areas involved, cash compensation will be made. Among
those affected by land acquisition for four substations, two might involve acquisition of paddy
land, which could take a significant proportion of their land holdings. To minimize impacts on



                                              84

local farmers, alternative sites have been identified in nearby locations with either residential
land or vacant land. Most affected families prefer cash compensation. Further consultation will
be carried out prior to resettlement implementation.

Consultation and Disclosure

Extensive consultation and disclosure had been carried out during the resettlement planning
stage, and draft RAP had been translated into local language and distributed to affected
provinces and districts. Based on the final RAP a resettlement information booklet will be
prepared in both English and Khmer and distributed among the affected people and other
stakeholders. The summary of the final RAP will also be placed in the public places accessible
to the affected people.

In order to ensure that affected people's complaints on compensation and rehabilitation are
addressed in a timely and satisfactory manner, a well defined grievance redress mechanism will
be established by the Project. The PMUinEDC will establish a Committee for the consideration
of complaints and grievances, with members from EDC, IRC at both national and local levels,
Commune Committee Members; Independent Monitoring Organization (IMO) (Observer role);
and local village officials.

InstitutionalArrangement

For resettlement implementation, according to government decree in June 2006, Inter-Ministries
Resettlement Committee (IRC) will be responsible for resettlement implementation for all Bank
funded projects in Cambodia.       As project sponsor, EDC will participate in the process of
preparing and approving the RAP, reviewing compensation policies, conducting DMS activities,
and delivering compensations. The staff of EDC environment and social unit will be directly
involved in the process, and they will be supported by Project Implementation Consultant. IRC
and EDC will work closely with sub-committees to be set up in the project provinces. They will
be led by provincial governor and consist of members from district governors, commune chiefs
and heads of villages, as well as EDC branch staff.

Resettlement Cost Estimate

The total resettlement cost for the transmission component i s estimated at US$0.54 million,
which includes a 30% contingency.         Among total base costs, 32% i s for permanent land
acquisition, 20% for structure demolition and relocation, and 48% for removal of trees.

Monitoringand Evaluation

An Independent Monitoring Organization (IMO) will be appointed to monitor the resettlement
and compensation process. The IMO would also carry out income surveys among a group of
sample households to monitor changes of income and livelihood.

GMS-PowerTrade (LAOS)PROJECT: LandAcquisitionandResettlement

Scope of ResettlementImpacts

The proposed GMS-PT (Laos) Project includes two 115kV transmission lines with one from
Xesetl Substation to Ban Nadonkhouang Substation with 25 km, and the other from Ban Hat
Substation to the Lao-Cambodia border with 25.7km length. The construction of these two
transmission lines will involve limited amount of land acquisition and resettlement, which i s
mainly caused by acquiring land for building tower bases and clearing right of way (ROW)
under the transmission lines.23Two RAPSwere prepared by EdL based on impact survey and
proposed compensation policies.

According to the survey, the two transmission lines will acquire only 0.53 ha of land areas for
the construction of tower bases. Among total acquired land areas, 0.18 ha or 34% are paddy
land, which would affect 189 households in 26 villages. The remaining land areas are garden
land, housing land, forest, and scrub land. No structures or households will be relocated from the
ROW. A total of about 9,000 trees will be removed. During construction, temporary land
occupation of about 0.5 lha mightbe required.

Socio-economicConditions

The Xesetl to Saravan transmission line passes through 15 villages. The Ban Hat to Cambodia
border transmission line would affect 11 villages.               There are 2,516 households and 15,468
persons in these 26 villages. Among them, 189 households or 7.5% will be affected due to land
acquisition of tower bases for the transmission lines. Among these villages, there are two main
ethnic groups namely Lao-Loum and Lao Theung. The majority of Lao Theung people are from
villages along the Xesetl-Saravan transmission line.24

Agriculture and forestry including rice cultivation, vegetables and other cash crops, animal
husbandry, harvesting of non-timber forestry products (NTFP) and fishing, are the major
economic sectors in Lao PDR. In the project areas, most people rely on wet season rice
cultivation as their main source of income supplemented with livestock, fishing and NTFP.
About 17% of households are below the poverty line.

The socio-economic survey indicated that there are ethnic minority villages along Xeset 1 to
Saravan Line. Being located along the major regional road, these ethnic minorities have high
degree of integration with the dominant population, and potential impact caused by transmission
lines i s very small. The Bank has concluded that the Bank IP policy should not be triggered.




23  Since only one proposed new substation will be built on the public land areas, no land acquisition i s required.
24  Following GoL's and WB's guidelines on ethnic composition, they are considered ethnic villages. However due
    to high degree of integration and limited impact with no house demolitionhelocation, no impact on any cultural
    sites, and limited amount of land acquisition (only tower bases), the IP policy will not be applied and no Ethnic
    Minority Development Plan (EMDP) is required.


                                                       86

Objective and Principles

These would be the same as applicable for the Cambodia Project above.

Legal Frameworkand CompensationPolicies

In Lao PDR there are no specific laws concerning the details of resettlement and compensation,
other than general requirement for compensation to be provided. A national resettlement policy
has been prepared by Science, Technology and Environment Agency (STEA) with the support of
ADB, which is the process of being approved by Lao government. The following legislation
now in force are relevant in developing these two RAPs: the Electricity Law (1997), the Land
      (1997), the Forestry Law (1996), and Environmental Management Standard Documents
issued by MEM, and the draft National Policy on Resettlement and Compensation prepared by
STEA.

Based on the above laws and regulations, and based on successful implementation experience
from Southern Provinces Rural Electrification Project, a set of compensation standards and
valuation methods have been developed for the proposed Project.

For acquired paddy land, compensation rate i s based on 10 times of average annual crop value or
4,000 kip per square meter. For acquired garden land and scrub land, it i s set at one third of
compensation rate for paddy or 1,333 lup per square meter.25For affected trees, according to the
RAPs, the compensation rates might vary from 6,000 kip to 100,000 kip per piece due to
different types and growth levels.                  The actual compensation rates will be adopted during
implementation after identifying actual affected trees.

Rehabilitation Approaches and Options

All DPs, regardless of their legal status, will be provided compensation and rehabilitation based
on the policies adopted by EdL. Lack of legal paper of their customary rights of occupancy
certificates shall not be an obstacle for them to obtain compensation. Particular attention i s to be
paid to the needs of vulnerable groups among those displaced, especially those below the poverty
line, the elderly, women and children, indigenous groups and ethnic minorities. For those who
will lose farmland, due to limited land loss cash compensation will be provided; while those
losing structures and other attachments, compensation will be provided at replacement value.

Consultation and disclosure

Extensive consultation and disclosure had been carried out on the RAP and the EMP during the
resettlement planning stage, and the most recent consultations took place on March 13 and 14,
2007 for Xeset-Saravan and Ban Hat-Stung Treng respectively. Draft RAP had been translated
into local language and distributed to affected provinces and districts. Based on final RAP a
resettlement information booklet will be prepared in both English and Lao language and
disclosed in the project areas for further consultation.

25  In the RAPs, only compensationfor paddy was includedin the resettlementbudget



                                                              87

To ensure that DPs' complaints on compensation and rehabilitation are addressedin a timely and
satisfactory manner, a well defined grievance redress mechanism will be established by the
Project through provincial environment management committees. A special environment and
social unit has been established at EdL headquarters to handle resettlement implementation for
all projects under EdL.

InstitutionalArrangement

Three levels of institutions will be involved in the process of resettlement planning and
implementation. The first level i s the EdL headquarter office, which will be responsible for
overall project planning and implementation. Within EdL Headquarter Office, two separate
offices will be involved with resettlement operation. One i s GMS project office, and the other i s
Environmental Office. The second level of organization i s EdLBranch Offices in the concerned
provinces, which will be responsible for implementing actual transmission line construction and
coordinating with local authorities. The third level of organization i s the provincial environment
management committee in each concerned province, which consists of officials from both key
provincial departments and relevant districts. These three levels of organizations will form the
institutional network to ensure smooth implementation of resettlement activities.

ResettlementCost Estimate

EdL will ensure that sufficient funding i s available to cover all resettlement related cost for the
Project. The estimated resettlement cost amounts to 338.6 million kip, including compensations
of 21.6 million kip for permanent land acquisition, 226.2 million kip for removed trees, and 90.8
million lup for temporary land occupation and reclamation.

MonitoringandEvaluation

An Independent Monitoring Organization (IMO) will be appointed to monitor the resettlement
and compensation process. In order to ensure that objective of resettlement i s achieved, the I M O
would also carry out income surveys among a group of sample households to monitor changes of
income and livelihood.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENTAND MONITORING

Environmental Management and Monitoring would be carried out according to detailed plans
which are placed in the Project Files, see Annex 12.

A.      EnvironmentalManagementResponsibilities(Cambodia)

EDC and the PMU (Phnom Penh) will be responsible for ensuring the project complies with the
environmental policies, procedures, and best practices of the RGC and the World Bank. EDC
will check the specifications and special provisions that are set out in the construction contract.
The Project Implementation Consultant (PIC) will be responsible for ensuring, on a day-to-day
basis, that the mitigation measures and monitoring activities identified in the EMP are properly
implemented.


                                              88

EDC will be required to assign two environmental specialists in Phnom Penh during the
construction phase and one permanent environmental specialist during project implementation to
efficiently implement the required environmental monitoring and evaluation works at the sites.
The Project Implementation Consultant will be required to include environmental experts
(including biodiversity expert- see paragraph 77) in its team to ensure adequate supervision of
implementation of the EMP by the contractors. Environmental procedures to be followed are
described below:

Data Collection

Construction. Most data collection would be performed by the PMU (Phnom Penh). Some
monitoring activities (see Monitoring Plan) are the responsibility of government authorities (e.g.
Forest Authority and Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts for cultural properties); again these are
specified in the Monitoring Plan.

Operation.    The EDC Office of Social, Environment and Public Relations will have full
