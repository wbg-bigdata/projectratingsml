SUMMARY
1. The South West Indian Ocean Fisheries project (SWIOFP) is a GEF-funded Project
($12 million) which was approved by the Board on June 28, 2007 and became effective
on April 16, 2008. The Closing Date is November 30, 2011. In addition to the main GEF
support, the project benefits from parallel financing from the French Global Environment
Facility (FFEM); Norway (FAO/EAF Nansen Project); and FAO (South West Indian
Ocean Fisheries Commission).
2. The SWIOFP is one of three linked projects that address resource management in two
separate Large Marine Ecosystems (LME) in the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO). The
core project consists of the Agulhas and Somali Currents Large Marine Ecosystems
Project (ASCLME) implemented by the UNDP. The ASCLME Project, along with the
associated Western Indian Ocean Land Based Impacts on the Marine Environment
Project (WIO-LaB) implemented by UNEP, aims at providing descriptive information
about the targeted LMEs and to develop a common Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis
(TDA) and Strategic Action Plan (SAP) to the three sister-projects.
3. The SWIOFP Global Environment Objective is to promote the environmentally
sustainable use of fish resources through adoption by SWIO-riparian countries of an
Large Marine Ecosystem (LME)-based ecosystem approach to fisheries management in
the Agulhas and Somali LMEs that recognizes the importance of preserving biodiversity.
4. The SWIOF Project Development Objective is to assess the current status of offshore
fisheries within the 200 nautical miles Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of nine coastal
states bordering the Southwest Indian Ocean (Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, South
Africa, Comoros, Madagascar, Seychelles, Mauritius and France). The project objectives
are to (i) identify and study exploitable offshore fish stocks within the Project Area, and
differentiate between environmental and anthropogenic impacts on shared fisheries; (ii)
develop institutional and human capacity through training and career building; (iii)
develop a regional fisheries management structure and associated harmonized legislation;
and (iv) mainstream biodiversity in national fisheries management policy and through
national participation in regional organizations that promote sustainable exploitation of
fisheries resources.
5. At completion, SWIOFP should provide the ASCLME with the necessary information
to prepare the common TDA and SAP.
6. The SWIOFP comprises six components:
Component 1: Data gap analysis, data archiving and information technology including (i)
Fisheries data collection and evaluation; (ii) Compiling of a data atlas; and (iii)
establishment of information technology, data handling and communications systems.
Component 2: Assessment and sustainable utilization of crustaceans including (i)
assessment of deep-water crustaceans; and (ii) assessment of shallow-water crustaceans.
                                            3
Component 3: Assessment and sustainable utilization of demersal fishes including (i)
assessment of deep-water demersal fish; and (ii) assessment of shallower water fish.
Component 4: Assessment and sustainable utilization of pelagic fish including (i)
assessment of large pelagic species; (ii) assessment of small pelagic species and (iii)
assessment of super-small pelagic species.
Component 5: Mainstreaming biodiversity in national and regional fisheries management
including (i) assessing the state of knowledge of non-consumptive resources and marine
biodiversity; (ii) identification of key biodiversity values; (iii) identification of interaction
with fisheries including by-catch and (iv) identification of bio-indicators of ecosystem
health.
Component 6: Strengthening regional and national fisheries management, including (i)
identification of relevant national and international legislation and other instruments
relevant to the SWIOFP goal; (ii) harmonization of legislation between countries; and
(iii) development of regional resource management structures and capacity.
7. The project is managed by Kenya, which acts on behalf of all the participating
countries, and it is implemented through an independent Regional Management Unit
(RMU), based in Kenya, and National Management Units (NMU) in the participating
countries. The South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC) acts as the
Regional Policy and Steering Committee of the project.
8. The changes proposed in this restructuring paper are: (i) a reallocation of proceeds; and
(ii) a realignment of the project Closing Date between the PAD and the Legal
Agreements. These changes are necessary for the implementation of the remaining
activities to achieve the GEO and PDO and have been discussed and agreed to with the
project’s governing body (the Regional & Policy Steering Committee hosted by the South
West Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission), consisting of representatives of all
participating countries, and the Bank.

9. Budget reallocation is necessary due to the initial under-budgeting in component 6, and
a need to re-adjust amounts for each budget category so as to reflect the realities of
project and achieve the GEO and PDO. The changes mainly relate to financing of (i)
regional and cross-cutting activities primarily through the Regional Management Unit
(RMU) and component 6 instead of National Management Units (NMUs) and technical
components; (ii) development, under component 6, of fisheries management plans for
which funding was not specified in the original budget. Changes in budget categories
reflect changes in means of implementation i.e., use of staff of participating institutions
rather than consultants, and in the number of research cruises and training.

10. Based on the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the project is supposed to be
implemented over five years until September 27, 2012 whilst the Grant Agreement
indicates a Closing Date of November 30, 2011, which would be equivalent to a four-
year implementation period, which would be insufficient to achieve the GEO and PDO.

11. In addition, the ASCLME project has obtained a no-cost extension until March 30,
2013 in order to finalize the common TDA and SAP preparation. The SWIOFP’s
governing body has agreed to finance part of the completion activities for the TDA and

                                               4
SAP which consequently required the SWIOFP project duration to be extended until
March 30, 2013.

12. The proposed restructuring will align the Closing Dates to the later date of September
27, 2012 and extend the project by six months (March 31, 2013) in order to permit the
finalization of the TDA and SAP with the ASCLME project.

13. The GEO and PDO and associated outcome targets remain the same and are
achievable.


PROJECT STATUS
14. The current PDO performance rating is Moderately Satisfactory since important
acceleration and progress have been observed in project implementation, but delays are
still observed in procurement process and in achieving project objectives (GEO and
PDO). There is no outstanding audit report.
15. To date, the SWIOFP project has contributed to recent progress made in biological
research, strengthened regional networking and improved collaboration in the socio-
economic, environmental and geopolitical dimensions. The project has built real
momentum notably in training civil servants and students from all over the region, stock
assessments, research cruise deployment and regional databases development. Worth
mentioning are the MSc courses that have proved to be excellent instruments in
supporting capacity development and project activities at low cost. A regional fisheries
management structure is materializing through the effective use of the South West Indian
Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC) as a platform to discuss information on fisheries
development and management.
16. Improved knowledge of exploitable fisheries resources has been supported by gap
analyses for the four main groups of species (crustaceans, demersal, pelagic and non-
consumptive species), more than twenty research cruises, and implementation of four
regional databases (bibliographic, fisheries statistics, cruise data management and small
scale fisheries inventory).
17. Improved institutional and human capacity has been supported by various training
including Turtle Tagging and Monitoring, Stock Assessment, Observers, Ecosystem
Approach in Fisheries management, and financing provided to 22 Master of Sciences
(MSc) students.
18. Improved regional fisheries management structure has been supported fueling the
regional fisheries body, the South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission’s (SWIOFC)
Scientific Committee with research data and using the SWIOFC as the Regional & Policy
Steering Committee of the project, consequently reinforcing the role of SWIOFC as a
platform to debate fisheries information and management and supporting the
materialization of a regional fisheries management structure. The project also supported
the Beneficiary Countries to develop a common understanding of and position on tuna
management in preamble of the latest session of the regional fisheries management
organization for tuna fisheries, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC).

                                            5
19. Mainstreaming of biodiversity in fisheries management has been supported by the
definition of fisheries and environmental indicators to be used in the future by the
Beneficiary Countries for monitoring ecosystem health, the training of fisheries managers
in Ecosystem Approach in Fisheries management and the development of a road-map for
preparing a Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) and a Strategic Action Plan
(SAP) for the region.
20. Implementation has been severely hampered by a number of challenges, which were
elaborated in the Mid-Term Review (MTR); in particular slow procurement and hence
disbursement, ability and willingness of some structures to fully engage with the project,
and the continued rise of piracy affecting research activity at sea. However the last
implementation support, in September 2011, confirmed that these historical difficulties,
apart from the piracy issue, have been largely solved.
21. As of September 30, 2011, there is real momentum building in the project with
regards to both implementation of activities and achievement of outputs and the recent
MTR considers that the project results/outcomes and objectives can be achieved if the
implementation period is extended by a year, as was originally envisaged in the PAD.
The additional extension of six months is necessary in order to support the completion of
the TDA and SAP together with the ASCLME. Consequently the Participating countries
requested a restructuring that would align the Closing Dates of the Grant Agreement and
the PAD to the later date of September 27, 2012 and extend the project by six months
(March 31, 2013) in order to permit the finalization of the TDA and SAP with the
ASCLME project.



PROPOSED CHANGES

   •   Results/indicators

22. The Results Framework and Monitoring has been simplified and clarified in order to
monitor the progress toward achieving the GEO and PDO. The indicators have been
harmonized among the components.

23. The identification and study of exploitable offshore fish stocks (project objective (i))
will be monitored through the establishment and updating of regional database inclusive
of data generated by the project (indicator 1 for component 1) and the production of
analyses (indicators 2 for components 1 to 5); The development of institutional and
human capacity (Project objective (ii) through training (indicators 3 for component 1 to
5); the development of a regional fisheries management structure (project objective (iii))
through the effective use of the SWIOFC (indicator 2 for component 6); and the
mainstreaming of biodiversity (project objective (iv)) through the adoption of the
Strategic Action Plan, fisheries management plans and the environmental status and
stress reduction M& E plan (indicators 1, 3 and 2 of for GEO).

24. See Annex 1 for details and proposed revised Results Framework and Monitoring.

   •   Financing

                                              6
 25. Budget reallocation is necessary mainly due to changes in means of implementation
 (i.e., use of staff of participating institutions rather than consultants), revalidation of a
 number of priorities and focus requiring adjustments to the project costs. The changes
 mainly relate to changes in a number of research cruises and training, and financing of
 regional and cross-cutting activities (e.g. observer and MSc program) primarily through
 the Regional Management Unit (RMU) and component 6 instead of National
 Management Units (NMUs) and technical components, i.e., components 1 to 5. In
 addition, the project has to develop and implement management plans for each country
 but funding has not been specified in the initial budget, but is now reflected in component
 6.

 26. Changes in the country and RMU allocations reflect the budget needs in the each of
 the countries. The RMU was provided with a larger task than expected in terms of the
 implementation (management of training and operations - such as research cruises).
 Consequently the increases in the RMU and component 6’s budgets do not relate to an
 increase in project management cost, but reflect the intensification of the regional
 approach in project activities’ implementation.

 27. The increase of the regional and national fisheries management budget (component 6)
 compared to original budget is obtained by the transfer of the financing from the
 technical components (1 to 5).

28. Main changes in categories are in the Consultant Services and Operating Costs. The
Consultant Services decreases since regional collaboration and arrangements permit
direct implementation by the staff of participating institutions without need for
consultants’ support, and the budget balance would be transferred to Operating Expenses.
Operating Costs also increase with a reallocation from the Unallocated category.
