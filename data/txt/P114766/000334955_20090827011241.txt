Project development objective Ref. PAD B.2, Technical Annex 3

The primary project objective i s to increase and improve the supply of electricity to business enterprises and
households in southern Kazakhstan in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner.

Project description Ref. PAD B.3.a, Technical Annex 4

Construction of 220 k V overhead transmission lines (OHTLs) between Moinak HPP and Shelek Substation
(SS) and between Moinak HPP and Robot SS.

Modernization Shelek SS and Robot SS.

Construction of outdoor switchyard at the Moinak HPP to evacuate power to Shelek SS and Robot SS.

Consulting and technical services.

Which safeguard policies are triggered, if any? Ref. PAD D.6, Technical Annex 10

Environmental Assessment .(OP/BP/GP 4.0 1). The project presents well-defined and well-understood
environmental issues o f narrow scope. The expected environmental issues are minor, of limited duration,
influence a relatively small area and occur primarily during the construction phase. Environmental category:
B. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared and disclosed in Kazakhstan and the Bank's
InfoShop. An Environmental Assessment (EA), including updated EMP for the detailed alignment and
working designs of the OHTLs will be prepared during implementation when these are available, and will be
subject to review and approval by the Bank and by the competent authorities as required under the EA
procedures of the Republic of Kazakhstan (ROK).

Involuntary Resettlement (OPBP 4.12). Relatively limited amount o f land will need to be expropriated for the
Moinak HPP switchyard (4 hectares) and the OHTL towers (8.1 hectares). Therefore, a Land Acquisition
Policy Framework (LAPF) was prepared by the Borrower as a condition of appraisal. No physical
displacement of people will take place under the project. A specific Land Acquisition Plan (LAP) will be
prepared by the Borrower prior to the commencement o f any construction works.

Safety of Dams (OPBP 4.37). The project is linked to the construction of the 300 M W Moinak HPP which
includes an upstream dam. A Bank-appointed dam safety specialist reviewed the design and construction
practices employed and concluded that the dam was designed, constructed and will be operated in a manner
consistent with Bank policy.

Country and sector issues

1.        Country Context. Kazakhstan enjoyed strong economic performance between 2000
and 2007, with average real GDP growth o f 10%. However, the economy i s highly resource-
dependent, with minerals, oil and gas accounting for 73% o f exports and 39% o f GDP.
Consequently, the Republic o f Kazakhstan (ROK) has made diversification o f the economy a
development priority.

2.           The recent deepening o f the world economic crisis has had very negative
repercussions in Kazakhstan. Sharp declines in commodities export prices since late 2008 hit the
country with a major terms-of-trade shock and tighter financial markets have prevented
commercial banks from rolling over their sizeable debt repayment obligations. Economic
growth i s expected to slow to 1'YOin 2009. Pressures for devaluation led to an 18% devaluation
o f the national currency (Tenge, KZT) in January 2009.

3.          The overall financial position o f Kazakhstan remains fairly strong, but could weaken
somewhat in the near future. International monetary and National O i l Fund reserves s t i l l amount
to over US$45 billion. A decision to defend the current exchange rate o f 150 U T to the US$
could lead to the further depletion o f reserves.

4.          Kazakhstan continues to attract substantial foreign direct investment in connection
with the large off-shore Kashagan o i l project, which will allow the country virtually to double oil
production in 10-15 years. This fact, together with the probable recovery o f commodities prices
along with the world economy in a few years, implies that the medium and longer term growth
picture for Kazakhstan looks promising. In the context o f tighter conditions for Kazakhstan on
international financial markets, the government i s considering large-scale sovereign borrowing
from International Financial Institutions, particularly for infrastructure.

5.          Sector Context. The ongoing financial crisis i s expected to impact the electricity
sector in two important ways. The slowdown o f the economy will somewhat ease the current
and projected power deficits in the ,country. However, this impact can be offset by the more
restricted access to commercial financing o f generation and distribution investments.

6.           Electricity Generation. There are 60 power generation plants in Kazakhstan with a
total installed capacity o f 18,931 M W , o f which 14,788 M W i s available for generation. In
2007, total generation was 76.365 TWh, o f which coal-fired plants accounted for 84.3%, hydro
power plants (10.6%) and gas-fired plants (5.1%) providing the balance. While Kazakhstan has
sufficient generation capacity to meet domestic power demand, four-fifths o f power generation
comes from the northern part o f the country, predominantly from power plants located in the
coal-producing regions and to a lesser extent from hydroelectric facilities. Generation facilities
in the south are limited to small hydro, combined heat and power plants, and a high cost gadoil-
fired power plant. Most o f the large-sized thermal generation assets were privatized. The poor
condition o f the main equipment in many power plants will require decommissioning o f a
significant amount o f installed capacity i.nthe near future.
7.         Electricity Consumption and Trade. In 2007, total generation and gross domestic
consumption were 76.365 TWh and 76.440 TWh, respectively, with a small net import o f 0.08
TWh.' Kazakhstan exports power only to Russia. Imports are from Russia and Central Asia.
Imports from Central Asia are limited and depend primarily on the water released for irrigation
from the Toktogul reservoir in Kyrgyzstan and as such do not coincide with the Kazakh peak
demand in the month o f January.

8.         Transmission. The total length o f Kazakhstan's transmission lines (ranging from 35
kV to 1,150 kV) i s 23,281 km. The 74 high voltage transmission substations with a total
capacity o f 33,697 MVA are located in nine regional power networks. KEGOC owns and
operates all transmission assets at the 1,150 kV and 500 kV levels. KEGOC i s responsible for
dispatch control and operates international connections.

9.           KEGOC's transmission system consists o f three regional power grids:

     0   Northern grid connected to the Russian power system.

     0   Southern grid connected to Central Asian power system and the northern grid with a
         single circuit 500 kV tie line.

     0   Western grid comprising o f two subsystems which are largely isolated from the other
         systems and import power from Russia to supplement local generation.

10.         Distribution and Supply. There are 2 1 Regional Distribution Companies (REKs),
which own smaller sized generation units, transmission at 110 kV level and electricity and heat
distribution networks. The total capacity o f the regional level generating plants accounts for
nearly half o f the installed capacity in the country.

 11.       Power Sector Reforms. In the area o f power sector reforms, Kazakhstan ranks
among the most advanced countries in the former Soviet Union. The GOK began reforms in
 1996, with a view to introducing private participation and establishing a competitive power
market.     By 1997, the largest generation plants were separated from the former
Kazakhstanenergo, KEGOC was formed to operate the high voltage transmission network and
the REKs were established. A competitive retail market i s being introduced.

12.        Privatization. Most o f the large-sized thermal generation assets have been privatized
to foreign and local strategic investors. The large hydropower plants have been given on a
concession basis to private investors. Most o f the REKs were privatized.

13.       Wholesale Market Structure. The wholesale electricity market i s fully liberalized
and operates mainly on the basis o f bilateral contracts between generators and large consumers
or ESOs for direct sale o f power.




 For more details, see the national electricity balance table in Annex 1.


                                                          2
14.        Under the ongoing Bank-supported electricity transmission rehabilitation project, the
GOK established a well-functioning liquid spot market (KOREM), accounting for about 20% o f
total wholesale turnover.

15.        To complete the wholesale electricity market reforms, a real-time balancing market
was established under the ongoing Bank-supported North-South (NE) Electricity Transmission
Project. Since January 2008, the balancing market has been operated by KEGOC on a trial basis.

 16.       Sector Regulation. The Ministry o f Energy and Mineral Resources i s in charge o f
licensing activities. Under the transmission rehabilitation project, a Grid Code was adopted
which established a set o f transparent rules governing non-discriminatory third-party access to
the transmission network.

17.        Under the Law on Natural Monopolies, the natural monopoly parts o f the power
sector (KEGOC and REKs) are regulated by the Agency for Regulation o f Natural Monopolies
(ARNM). The Law ensures full recovery o f justifiable costs, including the cost o f new
investments, for the regulated monopolies. KEGOC's transmission tariffs are approved by the
ARNM on a justifiable cost-plus basis. The existing tariffs are cost-reflective and provide for a
10% rate o f return on the regulated asset base, thereby allowing KEGOC to operate profitably.
Under the N/S project, zonal tariffs were introduced to foster greater competition among
generators and provide market-based signals to deal with congested transmission capacity.

18.        Growing Electricity Deficit in Southern Kazakhstan - Key Project Rationale.
Vigorous economic growth and increasing diversification o f the economic base have led to a
sharp upswing in electricity demand in Kazakhstan. Demand growth has averaged over 6% per
year between 2000 and 2007. The southern regions have experienced especially rapid growth (at
about 8% per year).2 While Kazakhstan has sufficient generation capacity to meet domestic
power demand, four-fifths o f power generation comes from the northern part o f the country.
Generation facilities in the south are limited to small hydro, combined heat and power plants,
and a high-cost gadoil-fired plant at Zhambyl.

19.          The existing N/S electricity transmission lines via which low-cost electricity i s
transmitted from the north to the south have a limited capacity o f 650 M W . This i s grossly
insufficient to meet demand in the south. In 2007, power deficit in the south (difference between
demand and local generation) was 865 M W (or half o f regional consumption). At present, the
deficit i s met largely by transmitting power from the north and in part by imports. During
winter, the costly Zhambyl plant i s operated. However, the deficit cannot be fully met in the
winter period o f maximum electric loads, which necessitates restrictions on consumption (load
~hedding)~ an adverse impact on regional economic development.
             with



2
 For the purpose of this project, Southern Kazakhstan comprises the following oblasts: Almaty, Zhambyl, South-
Kazakhstan and Kyzylorda.
 For example, in the Almaty power region, consumption restrictions ranged from 50 MW to 80 MW during the
2005-2006 and 2006-2007 winter periods. During the 2008-2009 winter, supply restrictions in southern Kazakhstan
were in the range o f 230-360 MW.



                                                      3
20.         Looking ahead, following the recovery from the economic slowdown in 2008-2009,
electricity demand in southern Kazakhstan i s expected to increase vigorously (nearly 6% per
year till 2020) and the power deficit i s expected to quadruple by 2020 (from 865 M W in 2007 to
3,400 M W ) unless major new investments are undertaken in the generation and transmission
sectors. The deficit i s predicted to be particularly severe in the Almaty region. At present,
energy and peak supply capacity in the south i s limited to 3,000 M W o f total installed capacity
(of which only 2,300 M W i s operational) with most o f the plants obsolete. Investment costs in
the south are prohibitive in comparison with the north both for rehabilitation o f existing capacity
and for new generation. Therefore, major investments are unlikely in the south in the medium
term except for the Moinak HPP (MHPP) under completion whose supply o f valuable peak
power i s critically needed also for frequency regulation. N e t imports from Central Asia are not
expected to increase substantially in the foreseeable future as availability i s primarily dependent
on the water released for irrigation from the Toktogul reservoir in Kyrgyzstan. Longer t e r m
imports from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are uncertain at this time and depend crucially on the
availability and costs o f hydropower to be generated by plants currently under construction
(Sangtuda in Tajikistan) or envisaged (Rogun in Tajikistan and Kambarata in Kyrgystan).

21.          In order to address the growing supply constraints in the southern region, in May
2007 the GOK approved an ambitious plan for the expansion and further modernization o f the
electricity industry, focusing on substantial increase o f generation capacity as well as extension
and modernization o f the high voltage transmission network during the period 2007-2015.4

22.        On the transmission side, the second N/S line i s currently under advanced
construction with IBRD co-financing and, upon completion in 2010, it will increase the
interconnector's capacity from 650 MW to 1,350 MWV5      However, the supply deficit in the south
cannot be eliminated even when the first unit o f the new Balkhash coal-fired power plant comes
on stream around 2015. The shortage will remain particularly acute for peak power.

23.        Therefore, the proposed Moinak transmission investments, in conjunction with the
MHPP, are a key part o f the overall strategy to minimize the power shortage in the south by
2015. Among the priority new generation projects i s the MHPP, a 300 M W facility on the
Charyn River under advanced construction to be completed in 2012. (For more details, see
Annex 4). The plant w i l l generate much-needed incremental regulating power. The proposed
project will support connection o f the MHPP to the high voltage transmission network through
construction o f new transmission lines as well as modernization o f related SS facilities.

24.        Another key transmission project i s the construction o f a new bulk supply point for
Almaty Oblast ("Alma" SS) including upgrading o f transmission l i n k s between "Alma" and
existing as well as prospective power sources (Balkhash, MHPP, etc.). Existing high voltage
substations in the south are overloaded and lack the capacity to handle rapidly rising loads,
which causes power restrictions and weakens reliability o f supply.

  Under the plan, 8,164 MW additional generation capacity i s envisaged totaling US$12.9 billion, including the
construction o f new power plants (Balkhash Power Plant, 2,640 MW; Moinak HPP, 300 MW, etc.) and expansion o f
existing generation facilities (Ekibastuz GRES-2, 1,050 M W ; Astana TETs-2, 240 M W , etc.).
'However, that second N/S line cannot be fully utilized until substantial additional coal-based generation capacity i s
created, which i s not expected before 2015. Even when fully operational in 2010, transfers to the south w i l l be
constrained by the current lack o f surplus capacity available for power generation.

25.          Development Impact. Expanding and upgrading the transmission system in the
south i s urgently needed to forestall emergency situations and widespread supply cut-offs hurting
the economy and the population. The project also offers benefits in terms o f system
reliabilityhecurity and higher quality electricity supply. The extended transmission system
(Moinak facility together with the proposed "Alma" SS project) will strengthen the reliability o f
the parallel operation o f the power systems o f Kazakhstan and other countries in Central Asia.

Rationale for Bank involvement

26.       The Bank has had a long and productive relationship with both the Republic o f
Kazakhstan and KEGOC in the development o f the electricity sector o f Kazakhstan. Under two
ongoing Bank-financed transmission operations, the country has developed one o f the most
modern and efficient power systems in the Former Soviet Union, with an effective Independent
System Operator and a liquid, electronic spot market supplementing contractual arrangements
between generators and customers.

27.         The Bank's involvement in the proposed project would allow continued policy
dialogue with the G O K and continued implementation monitoring o f important sector reforms
initiated under the two transmission operations. Moreover, the financial savings to KEGOC
associated with Bank participation are substantial and would allow more moderate increases in
transmission tariffs than would otherwise be required, benefiting all electricity consumers.

28.         The proposed project i s consistent with the objectives o f the Country Partnership
Strategy6, which are to support the development priorities o f the GOK. These include as one o f
the key pillars "investing in human capital and infrastructure" given that major segments o f
infrastructure (e.g., roads and power transmission networks) do not meet the needs o f a rapidly
expanding economy. The proposed project would support this development priority by
addressing growing constraints to reliable power supply.

Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

29.         Kazakhstan's current development focus i s on achieving international standards for
public services and enterprises and increasing the competitiveness o f i t s tradable non-oil sectors.
This in turn involves (i) improving public institutions and policies; (ii) fostering competitiveness
                               investing in human capital and infrastructure; and (iv) safeguarding
and facilitating business; (iii)
the environment. Reliable and cost-effective electricity supply is fundamental to both social and
economic development. To this end, the G O K has chosen to invest significant efforts in support
o f the modernization and expansion o f the power sector. From the broader development
perspective, the project will enhance the well-being o f the population in southern Kazakhstan by
(i)  providing low-cost and higher quality energy; (ii)      removing a binding energy supply
constraint to continued economic growth in the region; and (iii)             increasing the region's
competitiveness in terms o f industrial and commercial development with related benefits in
terms o f employment and income.

 The Country Partnership Strategy for Kazakhstan was presented to the Bank's Board o f Executive Directors on
September 8, 2004 and updated in a Progress Report No. 43393-KZ dated May 1, 2008 covering years through
2010.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Lending instrument

30.          Specific Investment Loan (SIL) would be used. The Bank would extend an IBRD
loan o f US$48.0 million to KEGOC to finance the proposed project under terms agreed during
project preparation. The Borrower has elected to take a U S Dollar Flexible Loan at 6 month
L I B O R plus fixed spread, commitment-linked, level repayment o f principal with 5 years grace
period and 25 years maturity. The loan will be guaranteed by the Republic o f Kazakhstan. The
total project cost i s US$68.6 million. Total financing required (including interest during
construction and front-end fee for the IBRD loan) i s US$73.4 million o f which the Borrower will
finance US$25.4 million from its own resources.

Project development objective and key indicators

31.        The primary project objective i s to increase and improve the supply o f electricity to
business enterprises and households in southern Kazakhstan in an economically and
environmentally sustainable manner. This objective will be achieved by increasing the capacity
o f the power transmission network to allow the evacuation o f clean electricity generated by the
MHPP to the south.

32.        Completion o f the integrated project (HPP and transmission) is expected to have the
following o ~ t c o m e s : ~

      0   Increase in the amount o f power available to customers in the southern region with a
          consequent reduction in load shedding.
          Improved quality and reliability o f electricity supply.
      0   Lower average cost o f generation owing to the introduction o f additional hydroelectric
          power into the system.
      0   Reduced GHG emissions as a result o f displacement o f coal/oil-based thermal generation.

33.          The project monitoring indicators are as follows:

      0   O n completion o f the project, available peak capacity in the southern region will be
          increased by an average o f 250 MW.
      0   O n completion o f the project, the need for peak period load shedding in the southern
          region will decline.
          On average, once the HPP is operational, in excess o f 1,000 GWh o f hydroelectricity will
          be available to electricity consumers in the southern region.
          About 1.2 million tons o f COz emissions will be avoided annually.

34.         The project comprises the construction o f two 220 kV single-circuit alternate current
OHTLs, with a combined length o f about 322 km, to evacuate power from the MHPP to the
existing 220 kV Shelek SS and Robot SS; the modernization o f the above SSs; and construction
o f an outdoor switchyard (OSY) at MHPP. Specifically, the project will be undertaken under the

components:

        A1 - Construction of OHTL from MHPP to Shelek SS. This involves the construction
        o f about 97 km long 220 kV single-circuit OHTL. The design includes aluminium
        conductor steel reinforced (ACSR), horizontal phase arrangement, anchor angle steel
        towers, ground wire lightning protection, and high frequency carrier communication.

             -
        A2 Construction of OHTL from MHPP to Robot SS. This involves the construction
        o f about 225 km long 220 kV single-circuit OHTL. The design includes ACSR,
        horizontal phase arrangement, anchor angle steel towers, ground wire lightning
        protection, and high frequency carrier communication.

Component B - Modernization of Substations. I t consists o f the following sub-components:

        B1 - Construction of 220/110 kV OSY at MHPP. The works include the construction

 In order not to compromise the competitiveness of the procurement process, the cost estimates for the individual
project components were excluded in this version of the PAD which the Bank releases to interested parties after the
Board of Executive Directors approves the project. This was done at the Borrower's explicit request during loan
negotiations.

Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

35.         With respect to lessons to be drawn from prior work in the region and sector, Bank
experience has shown that (i) need to coordinate among key GOK agencies can present
                                 the
challenges that should be taken into account in both the project processing plan and in the
ultimate scope and design o f the project; and (ii)     competent and efficient national project
management staff are invaluable in ensuring the viability and sustainability o f the project and
should be brought on at an early stage. In the case o f the proposed project, a significant amount
o f the necessary coordination has already been carried out by KEGOC, including obtaining the
approval o f the State Expertise, and obtaining support o f GOK ministries with regard to the
feasibility study, environmental impact assessment and project financing plans.

36.          Prior experience in the implementation o f transmission projects has also revealed
some specific areas that require special attention, including the need for thorough analyses so
that facilities are designed and routed to minimize social impact. Also, commitment by
provincial governments and public participation are key factors to successful environmental
management. All o f these issues are addressed in the proposed project as part o f the detailed
route selection and environmental impact assessment. Finally, previous projects with KEGOC
have shown that turn-key contracts for the construction o f transmission lines and rehabilitation o f
substations provide an efficient way o f implementing projects in a cost-effective manner without
over-burdening the company's project management capabilities.

Alternatives considered and reasons f o r rejection

37.         Technical Alternatives. The approach adopted by KEGOC to transmission line
routing encompassed economic, technical, social and environmental considerations.
Identification o f the routes was carried out using aerial photos and topographic maps.

38.         According to the feasibility study, the preferred routes for the two OHTLs were
chosen after a thorough evaluation o f potential route alternatives. The following main
alternatives were considered:

       One double-circuit O H T L to Shelek SS.
       One double-circuit O H T L to Saryozek SS.
       Two single-circuit OHTLs to Shelek SS (on the same route).
       Two single-circuit OHTLs to Saryozek SS (on the same route).
       One single-circuit O H T L to Shelek SS and a single-circuit O H T L to Saryozek SS passing
       through Tashkarasu SS and Aidarly SS.
       One single-circuit O H T L to Shelek SS and a single-circuit OHTL to Saryozek SS.
       One single-circuit OHTL to Shelek SS and a single-circuit OHTL to Robot SS.

             Although option (a) was perceived to be potentially a simpler and cheaper option,
purely on the basis that it ensures that the capital costs o f the transmission line are minimized,
this alternative was considered unreliable from the power system operation standpoint. Power
system security o f supply requires sufficient and reliable availability o f transmission capacity to
link production with generation andor consumption. Options (a) through (d) accommodate such
reliability and security concerns. Double-circuit transmission lines are vulnerable in that both


                                                 8
circuits are assembled on the same mounting and therefore subject to the same atmospheric risks.
The same applies to transmission lines sharing the same route, although the likelihood o f
suffering the same impact i s reduced by the fact that the lines are mounted on different pylons.
In addition, these options presented problems regarding insufficient existing capacity at the
receiving SSs. Consequently, further expansion investment was needed. Options (e) and (0
were dropped for environmental reasons (OHTL crossing the Charyn and Altyn-Emel "Specially
Protected Natural Areas"). In the face o f the legal obstacles, the focus o f the analysis has shifted
to option (g) which minimizes overall project costs, maximizes the reliability and security o f
supply criteria, and complies with relevant environmental protection requirements o f the ROK.

40.          Electricity Imports into Southern Kazakhstan. As an alternative to domestic
generation, consideration was given to the possibility o f increased imports o f electricity from
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, both o f which have low-cost hydroelectric power. However, the
hydropower plants also supply water for irrigation, and are dispatched so as to ensure adequate
water supply to the agriculture sector. As a result, surplus electricity from these countries i s
available mainly on a seasonal basis and could not be relied on to cover growing winter peak
demand in southern Kazakhstan. In addition, the available hydro-power export capacity in
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan i s seriously limited in relation to Kazakhstan's needs. Possible new
generating facilities in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan would increase the export potential, but most
o f these are s t i l l at the conceptual planning stage.

the projects under implementation and has established satisfactory financial management
arrangements (see details in Annex 7).

45.        Disbursement. Components A, B and C1 o f the project will be co-financed by the
Bank. The proceeds o f the loan will be disbursed over a period o f 3.5 years. The project will
follow transaction-based disbursement procedures: payments through DAY    reimbursement, direct
payments and special commitments (see Annex 7).

46.        Procurement. The project components to be financed by the Bank loan are grouped
into three packages: (i)   construction o f transmission lines (design, supply and installation
arrangement); (ii) substation modernization (design, supply and installation arrangement); and
(iii)consultant services for procurement and project management (QCBS procedures). Details
on procurement arrangements and the project Procurement Plan are in Annex 8.

Monitoringand evaluation o f outcomes/results

agencies, will monitor progress against agreed performance indicators specified in section B.2
and Annex 3. The PMD w i l l provide, on a quarterly basis, 45 days after the end o f each quarter,
consolidated reports on project implementation progress in the Bank's Interim Financial Report
(IFR) format.

Sustainability

48.         The proposed project enjoys strong support from the ROK which i s the majority
investor/owner in the associated MHPP. KEGOC has already invested approximately US$0.5
million in preliminary feasibility and design work. In June 2008, the ARNM approved an
increase o f approximately 10% in the transmission tariff and 20% in the dispatch tariff. The
company's 2009-2020 Development Plan envisions further increases o f 16% in the transmission
tariff and 10% in the dispatch tariff in 2009. The R O K has also committed to provide up to KZT
9 billion (US$75 million) in additional equity over the 2008-2010 period o f which KZT 4.23
billion (US$35.2 million) was provided in 2008 and further equity injections o f up to KZT 20.8
billion (US$173 million) over the 2011-2017 period to ensure the company's liquidity.

2007 and 2008, there i s a perception o f high corruption in Kazakhstan, with the country
occupying No. 150 position (CPI score o f 2.1) in 2007. However, KEGOC i s a well-managed
company with strong corporate governance arrangements and no incidences o f corruption have
been flagged during the implementation o f the two Bank-financed projects. The company has
submitted financial reports on time and has been audited regularly by reputable audit firms. N o
major issues have been raised either in the audit reports or management letters. The country risk
i s significant, but the residual FM risk after mitigation i s assessed to be moderate.

60.        Economic Internal Rate o f Return. For purposes o f the economic analysis, the
project was assessed in the context o f the overall scheme for providing incremental power supply
from MHPP to customers in the southern region o f Kazakhstan. Economic costs o f the project
(net o f VAT) were assumed to include, on the capital side, the cost o f the new Moinak OHTLs,
switchyard at MHPP, modernization o f Shelek and Robot SSs as well as the undisbursed capital


                                                13
costs o f the MHPP. Annual operating costs included (i)      operation and maintenance (O&M) o f
the HPP; (ii) & M o f the transmission network; (iii)
                 O                                             estimated fully allocated cost o f
distribution; and (iv) transmission and distribution losses.

61.        Project benefits evaluated in the analysis fall into four categories: (i)   customer
willingness to pay (WTP) for power supply; (ii)  avoided incremental costs o f self-generation to
compensate for load shedding; (iii) premium customer WTP for peak power provided by the
                                     a
HPP; and (iv) benefits from reduced CO;? emissions as a result o f avoideddisplaced thermal
generation. Details o f the assumptions and values used are in Annex 9. The analysis yielded an
estimated EIRR o f 17.1% and a Net Present Value (NPV) o f US$29 1 million.

62.          The economic analysis took a conservative stance with respect to customer WTP,
limiting it to the marginal tariff for electricity supply. This approach ignores the consumer
surplus benefits o f incremental electricity supply which are inherent in the downward sloping
nature o f the demand curve. While there are no comprehensive surveys o f Kazakh consumers on
which to base a consumer demand curve, a curve might have been postulated using data from
other countries. This would have involved a measure o f speculation, however, regarding the
applicability o f other countries' experience to the Kazakh situation. Since the project displays a
high EIRR without the inclusion o f consumer surplus, this benefit was omitted.

63.        Financial Internal Rate of Return. The scope o f the FIRR analysis was limited to
the incremental costs and revenues incurred by KEGOC as a result o f i t s investment in the
transmission facilities. Specifically, financial costs include the capital and O&M costs
associated with the new transmission facilities. Benefits include the incremental transmission
and dispatch tariffs received by KEGOC as well as savings in the cost o f compensating
transmission losses owing to access to low-cost hydroelectricity from MHPP. In estimating the
future revenue stream, anticipated real increases in KEGOC's transmission and dispatch tariffs
were taken into account. The estimated FIRR o f the project i s 13.3% (real), with NPV o f
US$38.8 million based on KEGOC's weighted average cost o f capital.

64.         Financial Performance of Borrower. KEGOC' s financial performance has shown
steady improvement in recent years, with increasing profitability, positive cash flow and
satisfactory liquidity. Equity injections o f K Z T 7.2 billion in 2008 ( U T 3 billion from the
national budget and KZT 4.2 billion from SamrukKazyna) helped to offset rising debt service
and capital investment obligations.'

65.          2009 i s expected to be more difficult. During the first quarter, transmission volumes
f e l l by 20% on a year-over-year basis, as major industrial customers severely curtailed their
outputs due to the economic downturn, while dispatch volumes were down by 9%. KEGOC has
applied for tariff increases o f 30% and 45% in transmission and dispatch tariffs, respectively,
anticipating that the Regulator might only award increases o f 18%-20%.          The probability that
the situation will improve significantly during the balance o f the year i s small as the global
recession and low oil prices are expected to persist well into 2010.


  In June 2008, SamrukKazyna, the shareholder o f KEGOC, agreed to increase the company's equity by K Z T 9.35
billion, to be disbursed over the 2008-2010 period, and to provide an additional K Z T 20.8 billion over the 201 1-
2017 period to ensure KEGOC's ongoing liquidity.

    well as mission estimates o f projected financial indicators. loThe projections take into account

    67.         The financial projections indicate satisfactory performance in terms o f profitability
    (apart from the projected loss in 2009 and leverage). Except for 2009, year-on-year debt service
    coverage i s also satisfactory. However, cash flow deficits are anticipated in 4 o f the next 5 years
    owing to rising capital investments and debt service obligations. This in turn draws the self-
    financing ratio below the covenanted level o f 25% in 2009 and 2010 (and possibly also in 2012).

       The financial projections in the P A D have been made by the Bank's project team and do not imply KEGOC's
    endorsement. The projections include a number o f assumptions which are subject to change. Therefore, the
    projections w i l l be revised by the Bank's project supervision team on an annual basis based on updated information
    and assumptions.
    11
       The capital investment plan includes the proposed Alma SS (US250 million), the second phase o f the
    Transmission Rehabilitation Project (US$360 million), reconstruction o f the Ossakarovka transmission line ( U S 5 7
    million) and general rehabilitation and upgrading o f depreciated equipment (US$145 million). It does not, however,
    include projects which are s t i l l at the concept stage (interconnection with the Western regional power system,
    transmission linkages to proposed new generating stations).


                                                             15
While accumulated cash together with planned equity injections are sufficient to maintain the
company's liquidity through 2009, forecasts indicate a risk that cash balances will fall below
zero in 2010, and the current ratio will drop to unacceptably low levels. If these cash shortfalls
materialize, KEGOC will need to draw on the parent company's commitment to provide
additional equity in order to maintain liquidity and/or adjust i t s capital investment program to
accommodate cash flow constraints.

68.         The financial projections indicate a need for careful monitoring o f KEGOC's ongoing
financial performance; however, they do not yet suggest an urgent need for remedial action. The
weaknesses in the company's financial outlook are largely due to the current slow-down in the
Kazakh economy, which in turn i s linked to the global recession and decline in commodity
prices. At present, there are no clear signs as to the timing o f an international recovery, and the
projections have therefore taken a conservative position, where KEGOC's transmission volumes
only recover to their 2008 levels in 2013. This may be unduly pessimistic, but in the event that it
proves to be true and liquidity i s jeopardized, remedies are available in the form o f either
drawing on parent company commitments for additional equity or delaying capital investments.

69.         The financial projections assume that transmission tariff discounts on transmission
services will not affect the financial viability o f KEGOC. At present, discounts are granted
primarily for electricity exports and international transit to Russia, which are transmitted over
under-utilized lines and which, based on existing power prices in Russia, would not be viable at
the full transmission tariff. To ensure that any future discounts do not threaten KEGOC's
financial viability, a covenant in the Loan Agreement (LA) provides that KEGOC shall not grant
tariff discounts on transmission services except for those that are based on commercial
considerations o the company. I n no case shall discounts be granted for transmission volumes
                  f
which would either displace higher-revenue volumes or require new investments in transmission
capacity.

70.         Financial Performance Covenants. The following financial performance covenants
will be included in the LA: (i)maintain a current ratio o f 1.0; (ii)
                                                                    maintain a self-financing ratio
o f 20% based on a three-year moving average o f the investment program; and (iii)     refrain from
incurring additional debt unless the debt service ratio, as measured by current net revenues and
maximum future debt service requirements, i s at least 1.2.

Technical

71.         Project design and technology i s standard for high-voltage transmission lines and SS
modernization. The technical design meets all reliability, environmental and economic standards
o f the industry. Equipment specifications are consistent with the design and structure o f the
existing network. The GOK has approved the design outlined in the feasibility study. KEGOC
will engage a turn-key contractor for the detailed design, supply and installation o f the
transmission lines. Another turnkey contractor w i l l be engaged for the detailed design, supply
and installation o f the SS works.

Fiduciary




                                                16
72.         Financial Management.         Assessment o f the financial management (FM)
arrangements for the proposed project was undertaken in July 2009, in conjunction with the FM
supervision o f the ongoing projects currently being implemented by KEGOC. The FM
arrangements include systems o f budgeting, accounting, financial reporting, auditing and internal
controls. The P M D o f KEGOC relies on corporate computerized accounting system to process
project-related transactions. However, the accounting system s t i l l does not have capacity to
generate interim financial reports and FMRs under the ongoing projects are prepared in Excel
spreadsheet. The P M D has a full complement o f FM staff, consisting o f a chief manager (FM),
assisted by a manager, accountant and disbursement specialist for each o f the projects. I t i s
expected that the new project will have dedicated accounting and disbursement staff.

73.        Fiduciary Risk at Project Level. FM arrangements o f KEGOC have been reviewed
periodically as part o f project supervision o f the ongoing Bank-financed operations. Based on
latest FM supervision in July 2009 it has been established that KEGOC has fully satisfactory FM
arrangements in place, including (i)  sound project accounting system that is integrated with the
corporate accounting system; (ii)  experienced and skilled project management team that includes
FM staff; (iii)timely and regular submission o f satisfactory interim financial reports; (iv) timely
submission o f satisfactorily audited project and entity financial statements; and (v) effective
internal control procedure that ensures completeness and accuracy o f financial transactions.

74.         The overall FM risk for the project is moderate. However, the project will be
implemented in an environment where corruption can be perceived as an important issue and,
therefore, adequate mitigation measures have been put in place to ensure that the residual project
risk i s acceptable, including (i)    regular review o f compliance with the internal control
framework; (ii)  regular monitoring o f activities o f the designated accounts, including regular and
timely reconciliation o f the designated accounts with bank statements; (iii)    quarterly submission
o f project Interim Financial Reports; (iv) audit o f project financial statements by independent
auditors on terms acceptable to the Bank; and (v) regular FM supervision and procurement
reviews will be conducted.

75.        Fiduciary Risk at Country Level. Based on Country Financial Accountability
Assessment o f 2002, the fiduciary risk is assessed as significant at the country level. There has
been no fiduciary assessment at the country level since then, but the fiduciary environment has
not changed much. However, fiduciary risk at the entity level is assessed as moderate and all the
elements o f the entity's FM systems can be relied on to support project implementation.

76.        Procurement. The latest Country Procurement Assessment Report is dated June
2000. A L a w on Public Procurement o f Goods, Works and Services was passed in May 2002.
The GOK and the Bank conducted a Joint Public Expenditure and Institutional Review in 2004,
which included a review o f the efficiency o f public procurement. This assessment led to
Kazakhstan being ranked as a High Risk country from the public procurement point o f view. A
new Public Procurement L a w took effect on January 1,2008. While the new L a w includes many
provisions that reflect international practices and Bank recommendations, it remains in need o f
further improvement and, therefore, the country's procurement risk category remains unchanged.




                                                 17
77.       KEGOC i s an experienced Bank borrower with a proven ability to implement large
and complex investment projects. The company's procurement performance under the ongoing
Bank-financed projects has been satisfactory.

78.         The P M D administers procurement. Since it i s already charged with the management
o f several investment projects, i t s implementation capacity i s being tested. To mitigate the
potential risk o f work and coordination overload, KEGOC will structure much o f the
procurement on a turn-key basis with prequalification. In addition, international consultants w i l l
be financed to provide assistance in procurement and project management.

79.         Based on the assessment o f KEGOC's capacity to implement procurement, the
overall project procurement risk i s rated as moderate. Procurement for the proposed project w i l l
be carried out in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits" published in May 2004 and revised in October 2006, and "Guidelines: Selection
and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers'' published in May 2004 and revised
in October 2006, as well as the provisions stipulated in the LA. More details on procurement
arrangements are in Annex 8.

Social

80.         N o significant social impact was identified at or in the vicinity o f the project sites.
N o resettlement i s required under the project. A relatively limited amount o f land (about 12.1
hectares) needs to be acquired for the project in accordance with the Land Acquisition Policy
Framework (LAPF). Improved access to low-cost electricity in southern Kazakhstan w i l l both
improve the well-being o f the population and alleviate the competitive disadvantage that the
region currently suffers because o f costly and unreliable electricity supply.

Environment

81.        Environmental Management. The project i s in full compliance with environmental
assessment regulations o f the ROK and World Bank safeguard policies for Environmental
Assessment (OP 4.01). Because o f the limited nature, extent and duration o f any potential
environmental impacts, the project has been assigned Category B under OP 4.01. Consistent
with this rating, KEGOC prepared an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which was
disclosed on i t s website on December 29, 2008. The EMP was also deposited in the Bank's
InfoShop on January 16, 2009. A revised EMP was disclosed on KEGOC's website and in
InfoShop on June 26, 2009. A public consultation was held on November 14, 2008. Key
environmental issues under the project include the normal construction issues associated with the
movement o f men, machines and materials, dust, noise, engine exhausts, disposal o f solid (non-
hazardous) wastes mostly from packaging and land preparation. (A more detailed discussion o f
the environmental aspects and other safeguard issues i s presented in Annex 10).

82.           The two project substations and the OHTL routes are located in remote areas on land
o f marginal agricultural value used mostly for cattle grazing. In June 2009, a local design
company         developed the preliminary line routing for the two transmission lines (pre-final
design stage). After formal approval o f this line routing, the survey, geological and hydrological
works w i l l be performed by a company to be engaged by KEGOC. Results o f this work w i l l be


                                                 18
input into the detailed working designs for the OHTLs. The detailed designs should have a
section on EA, which i s subject to the state environmental expertise. The detailed design stage
includes the requirement o f holding another public consultation for the project. The Bank will
thoroughly examine the detailed designs to verify that Bank safeguard requirements are satisfied.
Furthermore, under the Loan Agreement the Borrower shall ensure that the OHTLs will not
encroach upon any part o f the Charyn and Altyn-Emel Specially Protected Natural Areas.

83.          KEGOC's institutional capacity for implementing requirements specified in the EMP
i s satisfactory. Under the two ongoing transmission projects, KEGOC's environmental
management performance has been found to be highly satisfactory.

84.         Land Acquisition. N o physical displacement o f people will take place under the
project. C i v i l works at the existing Shelek SS and Robot SS will be carried out within existing
fence lines, not requiring new land acquisition. However, land will need to be expropriated for
the Moinak HPP switchyard (about 4 hectares or 8.7 acres) and for the OHTL towers (about 8.1
hectares or 17.6 acres). Since the exact number o f towers that will be built and the exact final
location o f the OSY at the MHPP are unknown at this time and will follow from the detailed
working designs during the first year o f implementation, the exact scope and incidence o f all
land acquisition requirements cannot be precisely assessed now. Therefore, under the applicable
Bank safeguard policy (OP/BP 4-12), a LAPF was prepared, which was approved by the Bank.
The LAPF was disclosed on KEGOC's website and in InfoShop. Once the final working designs
are accepted, KEGOC will prepare a specific Land Acquisition Plan (LAP) and submit it to the
Bank for approval before proceeding with construction.

85.       Dam Safety. The Moinak HPP i s not part o f the proposed transmission investment.
Nonetheless, it i s considered to be a "connected" project in the sense that performance of the
HPP would directly influence performance o f the Bank-supported transmission investment.

86.         The dam is located on the Charyn River. Because the dam i s considered a
"connected" project under Bank safeguard policies, the Bank engaged an independent dam safety
expert to perform a due diligence assessment o f the Moinak dam's compliance with OP/BP 4.37.
The assessment concluded that the dam was designed by qualified engineers and an experienced
firm. The drawings are o f high quality with sufficient details and quantitative calculations. The
independent dam safety expert verified that the dam design, construction and proposed operation
are consistent with the OP/BP 4.37.

Safeguard policies

          [YI      Environmental Assessment (OPBP 4.01)
                   The site o f the switchyard at MHPP i s in a remote rugged area near the
                   Charyn River. There are no significant environmental issues during
                   construction other than the normal issues o f dust, noise and disposal o f
                   construction wastes as well as protection o f the Charyn River water
                   quality. Reconstruction works at the Shelek and Robot SSs will be
                   confined to the boundaries o f existing fence lines. During construction o f
                   the OHTLs, there are no significant environmental issues other than the


                                                19
normal issues o f dust, noise and disposal o f construction wastes. The
selected routes and rights-of-way do not cross any known structures or
sites o f cultural significance or areas o f proven mineral reserves. For the
most part, the land use along these routes is for grazing or agricultural
production. In addition, to protect surface water quality, special attention
must be paid where transmission line routes cross rivers or streams and
where worker construction camps are sited. The routes selected do not
interfere with any migratory bird flight patterns. During operation, the
chief issue i s noise and public health and safety from the high electric field
strength. A satisfactory E M P was prepared and disclosed in the Bank's
InfoShop and on KEGOC's website, and will be updated with detailed
information reflecting the detailed designs when these are available.

>
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)
C i v i l works at the Shelek and Robot SSs will be carried out within
existing fence lines, thus not requiring land acquisition. There are no
current occupants and users o f these areas. Land will need to be
expropriated for the OSY at the MHPP switchyard and the O H T L towers.
The exact number o f towers to be built is unknown at this time, but will
follow from the detailed working designs for the power lines during the
first year o f implementation. Since the exact scope and incidence o f all
land acquisition requirements cannot be precisely assessed now, a LAPF
acceptable to the Bank was prepared by KEGOC as a condition of
appraisal. Once the final working designs for the OSY and the OHTLs are
completed, KEGOC will prepare a specific LAP and submit it to the Bank
for approval before proceeding with construction. N o physical
displacement o f people will take place under the project. Land will be
acquired through a government land fund with compensation to the
affected mivate ownershsers.

Safety of Dams (OPBP 4.37)
The project will evacuate power from the MHPP that i s currently under
construction. Since the transmission lines and the outdoor switchgear are
linked to the integrity o f the MHPP, this policy i s triggered as it represents
a potential reputational risk to the Bank. The Bank engaged an
independent dam safety expert to perform a due diligence assessment of
MHPP dam's compliance with OP/BP 4.37. The assessment concluded
that the dam was designed by qualified engineers and an experienced firm.
The drawings are o f high quality with sufficient detail and the quantitative
calculations were done in an appropriate manner. Several issues were
raised as part o f the due diligence assessment for which the Bank received
satisfactory clarifications from the project sponsor (JSC KazKuat).

and i s ready for implementation.

88.        The Procurement Plan was agreed upon. Procurement work i s at an advanced stage
for Part C (consulting and technical services) o f the project. Preparation has started for the two
more complex "design, supply and installation" packages (Parts A and B).

                                                              21
                         Annex 1: Country and Sector Background
                KAZAKHSTAN: Moinak Electricity Transmission Project

Country Backgroundand Development Strategy

1.     Country Context. Kazakhstan enjoyed strong economic performance between 2000 to
2007, with average real GDP growth o f 10%. However, the economy i s highly mineral resource-
dependent, with minerals, oil and gas accounting for 73% o f exports and 39% o f GDP.
Consequently, the Government o f Kazakhstan has made diversification o f the economy a
development priority. The rapid economic growth up to 2008 facilitated a sharp increase in
income per capita, which reached US$6,200 in 2008.

2.      The recent deepening o f the world economic crisis has had very negative repercussions in
Kazakhstan. Sharp declines in commodities export prices since late 2008 hit the country with a
major terms-of-trade shock and tighter financial markets have prevented commercial banks from
rolling over their sizeable debt repayment obligations. GDP growth i s expected to slow to 1% in
2009. Pressures for devaluation led to an 18% devaluation o f the national currency (Tenge,
U T ) . The devaluation has further complicated the situation in the banking sector as over 40%
o f loans are denominated in foreign currency and most revenue flows for Kazakhstan businesses
are in KZT. In light o f these difficulties, the GOK nationalized the two most problematic large
banks in February 2009 as part o f a broader Anti-Crisis Program.

3.      The overall financial position o f Kazakhstan remains fairly strong, but should weaken
somewhat in the near future. International monetary and National O i l Fund reserves still amount
to over US$45 billion. But claims on Republic o f Kazakhstan resources may grow substantially
in 2009. A decision to defend the current exchange rate o f 150 KZT to the US$could lead to the
further depletion o f reserves.

4.      Kazakhstan continues to attract substantial foreign direct investment in connection with
the large off-shore Kashagan oil project, which will allow the country virtually to double oil
production in 10-15 years. This fact, together with the probable recovery o f commodities prices
along with the world economy in a few years, implies that the medium and longer t e r m growth
picture for Kazakhstan looks promising. The challenge will be getting through the current
difficult period with minimal damage to living standards, infrastructure, and the National O i l
Fund fiscal reserves. In the context o f tighter conditions for Kazakhstan on international
financial markets, the GOK i s considering large-scale sovereign borrowing from International
Financial Institutions, particularly for infrastructure.

5.       Sector Context. The ongoing financial crisis i s expected to impact on the electricity
sector in two important ways. The slowdown o f the economy will somewhat ease the current
and projected power deficits in the country. However, this impact can be offset by the more
restricted access to commercial financing o f generation and distribution investments.

6.      Electricity Generation. There are 60 power generation plants in Kazakhstan with a total
installed capacity o f 18,931 MW, o f which 14,788 M W i s available for generation. In 2007,


                                               22
total generation was 76.365 TWh, o f which coal-fired plants accounted for 84.3%, hydro power
plants (10.6%) and gas-fired plants (5.1%) providing the balance. While Kazakhstan has
sufficient generation capacity to meet domestic power demand, four-fifths o f power generation
comes from the northern part o f the country, predominantly from power plants located in the
coal-producing regions (especially, Ekibastuz and Karaganda) and to a lesser extent from
hydroelectric facilities located primarily along the Irtysh River. Generation facilities in the south
are limited to small hydro, combined heat and power plants, and a high cost gadoil-fired power
plant at Zhambyl which i s operated (with government subsidies to cover high fuel costs) to meet
winter peak demand. Most o f the large-sized thermal generation assets have been privatized to
foreign and local investors. The large hydropower plants have been given on concession basis to
private investors. The poor condition o f the main equipment in many power plants will require
decommissioning o f a significant amount o f installed capacity in the near future. A number o f
major generators (along with the transmission system operator and several major industrial
consumers) operate a Capacity Reserve Pool to manage occasional emergency breakdowns o f
generating units in a market-based manner.

7.     Electricity Consumption and Trade. In 2007, total generation and gross domestic
consumption were 73.365 T W h and 76.440 TWh, respectively, with a small net imports o f 0.08
TWh.'* Domestic consumption, which was declining from 1990 to 1999, has since been
growing at an average rate o f 6% per year. Consumption growth has been especially strong in
the booming southern zone o f the country. Kazakhstan exports power only to Russia. Imports
are from Russia (to serve the western regions) and Central Asia. Imports from Central Asia are
limited (1.2 T W h in 2007) and depend primarily on the water released for irrigation from the
Toktogul reservoir in Kyrgyzstan and as such do not coincide with the Kazakh peak demand in
the month o f January.

8.       Transmission. The total length o f Kazakhstan's transmission lines (ranging from 35 kV
to 1,150 kV) i s 23,281 km. The 74 high voltage transmission substations with a total capacity o f
33,697 MVA are located in nine regional power networks. The state-owned Kazakhstan
Electricity Grid Operating Company (KEGOC) owns and operates all transmission assets at the
 1,150 kV and 500 kV levels. KEGOC i s responsible for dispatch control and operates
international connections, principally with Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. The central
dispatch arrangements are best characterized as self-dispatch by generators against contracts with
the distribution companies and large consumers directly connected to the transmission system.

9.       KEGOC's transmission system consists o f three regional power grids:

     0   Northern grid connected to the Russian power system.

     0   Southern grid connected to Central Asian power system (Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan)
         and the northern grid with a single circuit 500 kV tie line.

     0   Western grid comprising o f two subsystems which are currently isolated from the other
         systems and import power from Russia (2.2 TWh in 2007) to supplement local


l2For more   details, see the national electricity balance table in Annex 1.


                                                           23
        generation. In 2009, the just-completed 500 kV North-West transmission line w i l l
        connect the northern grid with Aktyubinsk in the west, thereby reducing the western
        regions' dependence on electricity imports from Russia.

 10.      Distribution and Supply. There are 21 Regional Distribution Companies (REKs),
which own smaller sized generation units (mostly combined heat and power), transmission at
 110 kV level and electricity and heat distribution networks. The total capacity o f the regional
level generating plants accounts for nearly half o f the installed capacity in the country. Not all o f
the REKs have been unbundled and some continue to retain the status o f vertically integrated
utilities. Energy Supply Organizations (ESOs), most o f them subsidiaries within REKs, and
private traders purchase electricity from generators to sell for retail customers. The generally
poor condition o f distribution equipment and installations causes comparatively high distribution
losses.

11.     Power Sector Reforms. In the area o f power sector reforms, Kazakhstan ranks among
the most advanced countries in the former Soviet Union. The G O K began reforms in 1996, with
a view to introducing private participation and establishing a competitive power market. B y
1997, the large "national level" electricity generation plants were separated from the former
Kazakhstanenergo (an integrated monopoly), KEGOC was formed to operate the high voltage
transmission network and the REKs were established. In addition, the single buyer model, under
which the REKs purchased power from the generators and resold it to local customers, i s being
replaced by a competitive retail market under which customers purchase energy from Energy
Supply Organizations (ESOs), which in turn pay KEGOC and the REKs for the costs associated
with transmission, dispatch and distribution.

 12.   Privatization. Most o f the large-sized thermal generation assets have been privatized to
foreign and local strategic investors. The large hydropower plants have been given on
concession basis to private investors. Most o f the REKs have also been privatized, a number o f
them under concession contracts.

 13,     Wholesale Market Structure. The wholesale electricity market i s fully liberalized and
operates mainly on the basis o f bilateral contracts between generators and large consumers or
ESOs for direct sale o f power. Provided that they acquire access to the KEGOC-operated
transmission network, large electricity consumers can enter the market and shop freely for
power. There i s strong competition in the bilateral contract market. .Under the ongoing Bank-
supported electricity transmission rehabilitation project, the GOK established a well-functioning
spot market (KOREM). In 2008, electricity trade under K O R E M was 7.6 TWh (about 15% o f
total wholesale turnover), reflecting high liquidity in international comparison. There are about
100 registered market participants. KOREM i s making preparations for the future introduction
o f financial contracts and attraction o f Central Asian market participants.

14.     To complete the wholesale electricity market reforms, a real time balancing market was
established under the ongoing Bank-supported N / S Transmission Line Project. Since January
2008, the balancing market has been operated by KEGOC on a trial basis. Once becoming fully
operational, KEGOC w i l l conclude market-based transactions on balancing bids submitted by
generators under transparent market rules.



                                                 24
15.      Sector Regulation. The Ministry o f Energy and Mineral Resources i s in charge o f
licensing activities. Under the transmission rehabilitation project, a modern Electricity Grid
Code was adopted (and updated from time to time to reflect changing sector conditions) which
established a set o f transparent rules governing non-discriminatory third-party access to the
transmission network and the services the grid operator i s obliged to provide.

16.      Under the Law on Natural Monopolies, the natural monopoly parts o f the power sector
(KEGOC and REKs) are regulated by the Agency for Regulation o f Natural Monopolies
(ARNM) which reports to the Prime Minister. The Law ensures full recovery o f justifiable costs,
including the cost o f new investments, for the regulated monopolies. l3KEGOC's transmission
tariffs are approved by the ARNM on a justifiable cost-plus basis. The existing tariffs are cost-
reflective and provide for 10% rate o f return on the regulated asset base, thereby allowing
KEGOC to operate profitably. Under the N/S project, zonal tariffs were introduced to foster
greater competition among generators.

17.     Kazakhstan began reforming the power sector in 1996, with a view to introducing private
participation and establishing a competitive power market. By 1997, the electricity generation
plants were separated from the former Kazakhstanenergo (an integrated monopoly) and largely
privatized. KEGOC was formed to operate the high voltage transmission network. REKs were
established to take over the functions o f regional electricity supply.

 18.   The key issues facing the power sector at the present juncture include: (i)     outdated plant
and equipment in the generation and distribution sectors; (ii)  system designs focused on meeting
broader regional rather than national power needs; and (iii)  rising costs as a result o f high capital
investment, inefficiency in system operations and higher hydrocarbon prices. Growing regional
imbalances in terms o f access to electricity supply are a key outcome o f these factors.

 19.    Strong economic growth and increasing diversification o f the economic base have led to
a sharp upswing in electricity demand in Kazakhstan in recent years. Total consumption grew
from 54.0 TWh in 2000 to 76.4 TWh in 2007 while generation increased from 5 1.4 TWh to 76.4
TWh. While Kazakhstan has sufficient capacity to meet domestic power demand, four-fifths o f
the country's power generation come from the north from power plants located in the coal
producing regions. Generation .facilities in the south are limited to small hydro, combined heat
and power plants, and a high cost oil-fired power plant at Zhambyl which i s operated to meet
winter peak demand. Currently, demand exceeds supply in the south by approximately 865 M W
(approximately 30% o f peak demand) and the deficit i s expected rise to 1,200 M W by 201 1. At
present, the deficit i s met in part by supplies from the north (620 M W ) and in part by imports
from Central Asia (240 MW). The table below shows Kazakhstan's electricity balance over the
2000-2007 period.




 l3Unlike in the case o f KEGOC, this provision has not been consistently carried out by REKs. Regulatory problems
resulted in few notable cases o f disinvestment by international private investors from the distribution business and
the relatively weak (but recently improving) financial condition o f REKs.

                    KAZAKHSTAN: Moinak Electricity Transmission Project

Background
1.      KEGOC operates the high voltage (1,150 kV, 500 kV, 220 kV, and 35 kV) SSs and
networks, with a total o f 23,281 km o f lines and 74 SSs o f 33.7 GW o f total capacity. The
network consists o f three separate parts: (i) western grid interconnected with Russia but
                                               the
isolated from the rest o f the Kazakh power system; (ii) northern grid also interconnected with
                                                       the
Russia; and (iii) southern grid connected with the northern grid and Central Asia.
                 the

2.      The southern regions o f Kazakhstan experience an acute shortage o f electricity while
low-cost coal-fired power plants in the north have surplus capacity. The existing N / S
transmission line via which low-cost electricity i s transmitted from the northern power stations to
the south has a limited transmission capacity o f approximately 650 M W . This i s insufficient to
meet demand in the rapidly growing southern part o f the country, especially in the industrial belt
between Almaty and Shymkent. In 2007, power deficit in the south (Le., the difference between
demand and local generation) averaged over 865 M W (about half o f the region's consumption).
While transmission from northern plants and imports from Central Asia help to alleviate the
shortfall, the deficit cannot be fully met in the winter period o f maximum electric loads, which
necessitates restrictions on consumption (load shedding) l4with an adverse impact on regional
economic development. Commissioning o f the new N / S line, scheduled for 2010, will add
approximately 700 M W to the capacity to transfer power from the north. However, this w i l l s t i l l
be insufficient to meet peak winter loads in the Southern region. Looking ahead, following
recovery from the 2009 recession, electricity demand in southern Kazakhstan i s expected to
increase substantially (nearly 6% per year till 2020) and the power deficit i s expected to double
by 2015 (from 865 M W in 2007 to 1,700 M W ) unless major new investments are undertaken in
the generation and transmission sectors. The deficit i s predicted to be particularly severe in the
Almaty region.

 circuit OHTLs with a combined length o f about 322 km, connecting the switchyard to be built
 at MHPP to the Shelek SS and Robot SS. In addition, KEGOC signed an agreement with
 Moinak GES JSC (project company/operator) on electricity and reserve capacity purchase.

 22. MHPP, currently under construction, i s being developed by Moinak GES JSC, which i s
 owned by the state-owned KazKuat JSC (51% o f shares) and the private Birlik JSC (49%). The
 project i s located on the Charyn River in the Almaty Oblast. The construction o f the plant was
 started in the mid-l980s, but the collapse o f the former Soviet Union and the consequent
 financing shortage led to i t s deferral. Considering recent shortages in power supply resulting
 from the growing demand for electricity, in 2005 the GOK made the completion o f MHPP a
 priority. Total cost o f the project i s US$447.34 million. The bulk o f the financing has been
 secured from credits by the Chinese Development Bank and the Development Bank o f
 Kazakhstan.

Project Participants
 23. In 2005, Moinak GES JSC was established. In April 2008, the China International Water
 & Electric Corporation (CWE) was selected for design, turnkey construction and
 commissioning o f the main MHPP facilities. According to the terms o f the Contract
 Agreement, construction i s to be conducted by Chinese (20%) and Kazakhstani (80%) entities.
 Main equipment (turbine and generator) i s to be supplied by the consortium o f two companies,
 Harbin Electric Machinery Co. Ltd and Andritz, Austria (former VA Tech). The SCADA

Operating Regime
25. The increasing demand for electricity requires adequate flexibility o f generation to avoid
large deviation in system frequency. MHPP will be partially operated as a peak-load
management plant to protect the power system during periods o f high demand. The proposed
intake reservoir will assist in managing daily operations but will have no real effect on seasonal
and annual variation.

Implementation Schedule
26. Construction o f the MHPP resumed in 2006. The Bank's project preparation team visited
the site in December 2008. The following points were noted during the visit:

0     Dam construction was nearing completion. Tunnel intake works were advanced. The
most critical activity i s the diversion tunnel excavation for a length o f 9,300 meters.

0     EPC contractor has already mobilized his team at site and their site office i s up and
running with adequate facilities.

 0    Temporary access roads have more or less been completed.

 0    Construction works, including the power plant, are expected to be completed by 2013.

ImplementingAgency

1.    The executing agency responsible for project management and implementation o f the
project will be the Borrower (KEGOC). KEGOC has an established Project Management
Department (PMD) which has been responsible for the implementation o f the two ongoing
Bank-financed transmission projects. The unit i s staffed by specialists in technical, financial,
environmental and procurement matters. The P M D liaises with other major departments o f the
company including Finance, TechnicalEngineering, Legal and Planning. The P M D will carry
out the day-to-day implementation activities o f the proposed project, including procurement,
project accounting and financial reporting, disbursement o f funds, administration o f the
Designated Account, withdrawal applications for disbursements and external audit
arrangements.

2.     KEGOC management will ensure that sufficient personnel are in place to efficiently carry
out the project. A competitively selected consulting firm will provide KEGOC with advisory
services in procurement and project management, including the preparation o f bidding
documents and technical specifications, site visits, quality control and monitoring o f all
executed work, and verification o f contractor's payments. KEGOC will also engage
consultants to provide technical services during the implementation phase for the selection and
approval o f the O H T L routes, engineering surveys, and engineering supervision o f the turn-key
contracts during construction.

 3.   Below is the detailed organizational scheme for project implementation.

            Annex 7: Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements
                K A Z A K H S T A N : Moinak Electricity Transmission Project
Background

1.    Assessment o f the financial management (FM) capacity o f KEGOC's PMD was
conducted in October 2008 and July 2009 in conjunction with the FM supervision o f the two
IBRD-financed projects under implementation. The aim o f the assessment was to determine the
capacity o f the P M D to provide satisfactory FM support for the proposed project. The
assessment focused on arrangements for budgeting, accounting, internal control, financial
reporting and auditing.

2.    Past FM supervision o f the two projects, including the latest one in July 2009, have
shown that the FM and disbursement functions are well done, with no significant weaknesses
noted. KEGOC has been submitting satisfactory financial monitoring reports for the two
projects regularly and on time. Past audit reports have been satisfactory, with no major issues
raised in the Management Letters. FM staff o f the P M D are experienced and very familiar with
the Bank's FM and disbursement procedures. The PMD uses the corporate accounting system
for project financial transactions. However, reporting to the Bank is s t i l l done in Excel
spreadsheet as the accounting system has not been customized to automatically generate project
financial reports.

3.     Fiduciary Risk at Project Level. Based on past FM supervision o f the Electricity
Transmission Rehabilitation Project (closed on June 15, 2009) and the ongoing North-South
Electricity transmission Project, it was established that the KEGOC continues to maintain
sound FM system that fully meets the Bank's requirements. The overall FM risk for the project
i s moderate. However, the project will be implemented in an environment o f perceived
corruption and, therefore, adequate mitigation measures have been put in place to ensure that
the residual project risk i s acceptable, including (i)    regular review o f compliance with the
internal control framework; (ii)   regular monitoring o f activities o f the designated accounts,
including regular and timely reconciliation o f the DA with bank statements; (iii)        quarterly
submission o f project IFRs; (iv) audit o f project financial statements by independent auditors o n
terms acceptable to the Bank; and (v) regular FM supervision and procurement reviews.

4.      Fiduciary Risk at Country Level. There has been no recent fiduciary assessment at
the country level, the last one having been conducted in 2002. However, this project i s not
subject to the country's public FM framework and the fiduciary risk at the entity level is
assessed as moderate and all the elements o f the entity's FM systems can be relied on to support
project implementation.

Conclusion

5.      Based on the assessment and past FM supervision o f the two projects implemented by
KEGOC, the project FM system established by KEGOC is capable o f accurately recording
project financial transactions and support timely preparation o f IFRs. The FM arrangements
are, therefore, satisfactory to the Bank. These arrangements include (i)sound project
accounting system that i s integrated with the corporate accounting system; (ii)
                                                                               experienced and
skilled project management team that includes FM staff; (iii) timely and regular submission o f

                                               43
satisfactory IFRs; (iv) timely submission o f satisfactorily audited project and entity financial
statements; and (v) effective internal control procedure that ensures completeness and accuracy
o f financial transactions and monitored periodically by the company' internal audit department.

Risk Assessment and Mitigation

6.    The overall FM risk for the project i s moderate and only a few additional measures are
proposed to mitigate the fiduciary risk and strengthen capacity. Although the project w i l l be
implemented in an environment o f high perceived corruption, adequate mitigation measures are
already in place to ensure that the residual risk i s acceptable. The table below summarizes the
FM assessment and risk ratings o f this project:

Country FM Issues

7.      The A&A ROSC for the country conducted in 2007 shows that capacity o f the
accounting profession is s t i l l l o w and there i s no critical mass o f professionally qualified
accountants, particularly in the public sector. Knowledge o f internationally recognized
accounting and auditing standards, such as IFRS, IPSAS, International Standards on Auditing
(ISA), i s limited due to the lack o f adequate capacity both in the public and private sectors.
Most project implementing entities use the cash basis o f accounting, which i s not in accordance
with IFRS, but i s allowed under IPSAS, and in many cases sufficient for proper project
accounting. Internal audit function exists only in very few institutions and external audit i s
practiced by individuals and a small number o f local audit firms. Most audits required by
international donors have traditionally been performed by the large international firms
belonging to the "Big Four" networks. The Bank has conducted a review o f local audit f i r m s to
determine their acceptability to audit Bank-financed projects. At present, only two Kazakhstan-
based firms are eligible to conduct audits o f Bank-financed projects.

8.      Corruption is widely acknowledged as a major issue in the country, as indicated in the
TI CPI for 2007 (No. 150 with CPI o f 2.1) and 2008 (No. 147 with CPI o f 2.2). The project
will thus be implemented in an environment o f high perceived corruption. However, the
company that will implement the project has maintained strong governance structures that
ensure compliance with corporate rules and policies as well as strong FM arrangements.
Fiduciary risk o f the projects implemented by KEGOC is considered moderate. There are
adequate procedures developed by the company to secure proper financial accountability of all
projects and to minimize project FM risks. No additional FM arrangements or specific risk
mitigation measures are envisaged for the project, except those intended to mitigate the country
fiduciary risks and build capacity. There have been no issues with the banking arrangements,
but with the current global financial crisis there i s need for caution in determining the amount
o f advances to the DA.

Implementation Arrangements
9.     The Borrower is JSC KEGOC which will be responsible for project management and
implementation. The company has a functioning P M D which i s headed by a Managing
Director who reports to the company's Vice-president for Development. The P M D liaises
closely with other major departments o f the company, including Finance, Engineering and
Planning. The PMD will carry out the day-to-day activities o f the project, including
procurement, project accounting and financial reporting, disbursement o f funds, including

                                                        45
        administration o f the DA and withdrawal applications for disbursements, and external audit
        arrangements.

         10.    The P M D w i l l be responsible for ensuring that project activities are implemented
        according to the legal documents, Procurement Plan, reporting on project progress to the
        company and the Bank, ensuring that procurement o f goods and services i s done in a timely
        manner and in accordance with Bank guidelines, managing project funds, maintaining accounts,
        getting the accounts audited, ensuring adequate budget provisions for the project, facilitating
        the work o f consultants, and reviewing consultant outputs.

        11.    The residual risk associated with KEGOC i s moderate with low probability o f external
        intervention to modify the structure and staff o f the organization. The same structure and
        arrangements for the implementation o f the existing Bank-financed projects will be maintained,
        including the PMD.

        Strengths

    .   12.    The significant strengths that provide a basis for reliance on the project FM include: (i)
        FM arrangements similar those established for the ongoing operations being implemented by
        KEGOC are adequate; (ii)      highly experienced and skilled P M D staff who are familiar with
        Bank procedures and requirements; (iii)   timely and regular submission o f satisfactory interim
        financial reports; (iv) timely submission o f audited entity and project financial statements with
        no significant issues in the Management Letters; and (v) effective internal control, including
        periodic review by internal audit.

        13.   There are no major weaknesses at KEGOC. However, there i s need to modify the
        accounting system to have capacity to generate IFRs as part o f upgrading the system.

        14.    Budgeting and Planning. Two departments o f KEGOC closely involved in project
        implementation are the P M D and Department for Capital Construction. Budget execution i s
        monitored during the year in the Financial Monitoring Reports/Interim Financial Reports
        (FMWIFR). The risk associated with planning and budgeting i s assessed as low.

         15.    Accounting Staffing. The FM function i s the responsibility o f the Financial Support
        Unit, including Head o f the Unit, two financial managers, two accountants and three credit
.       specialists. Each o f the two projects implemented by KEGOC has i t s dedicated accountant,
        financial manager and credit specialist (disbursement). However, they all are knowledgeable o f
        the other projects and can back up their colleagues if needed. Appropriate segregation o f duties
        between financial staff i s in place. The chief financial manager i s responsible for all aspects o f
        FM and accounting, including managing the DA. The financial manager i s assisted by two
        managers responsible for accounting and disbursements, assisted by an accountant and a
        disbursement specialist. The financial manager will be responsible for budget preparation for
        the project and have primary responsibility for the quarterly IFRs and preparation o f annual
        financial statements for audit. The financial manager will also manage an effective system o f
        internal control, ensuring adherence to established financial procedures and safeguarding the
        resources and assets o f the project. The risk associated with staffing i s assessed as moderate.

        16.    Information Systems. KEGOC uses Oracle-based Management Information System
        for company accounting. The database i s maintained on a network for both the project and
                                                        46
corporate entity. The Chart o f Accounts i s common to both as Oracle includes sub-accounts
that are project-specific. Project accounting i s integrated into the company's system. While the
project-related transactions are generated by the Project Accountant within PMD, they are
constantly reviewed and posted to the general ledger accounts by KEGOC main accounting
department staff. All transactions are based on appropriate source documents, such as invoices,
bank statements, contracts, notes o f acceptance, etc. Trial balances with project account
balances are printed out o n a monthly basis and reviewed by the financial manager for accuracy
and completeness. The accounting is maintained in U T . Revaluation to US$ i s made every
last day o f the month. The risk associated with information systems i s moderate.

17.     Accounting Policies and Procedures. The PMD will maintain appropriate financial
records and accounts in accordance with procedures established by the accounting policy and
normative documents o f the company. These accounts and records will reflect the progress o f
the project and identify its resources, operations and expenditures. Project accounts will reflect
all financial transactions during the project period separately for the IBRD loan and other
resources, where applicable, by project component and by expenditure categories. KEGOC's
financial reporting i s based on International Financial Reporting Standards and the company
uses accrual basis o f accounting. However, the company uses modified cash basis for reporting
project activities. The current chart o f accounts will be adapted to meet the new project's
requirements and project accounts will reflect all financial transactions during the project for
the IBRD loan, counterpart financing and funds from other financiers, by project component
and by expenditure categories. The risk associated with accounting policies and procedures i s
considered as moderate.

 18.    Internal Controls and Internal Audit. The P M D has to follow KEGOC accounting
policies and procedures. Internal control procedures under the project are adequate. There i s an
Internal Audit Division that i s accountable to President o f KEGOC and to the Management
Board. As part o f the continuous review o f internal control and accounting systems activities,
the project will be subject to periodic review by the internal audit division o f the company. The
risk associated with internal controls is considered moderate.

19.    Financial Reporting. FMRs for the ongoing Bank-supported projects are prepared in
Excel spreadsheets using data from accounting system. The same reports are submitted to
company management, who use them to monitor the project progress on a quarterly basis.
These reports have been submitted to the Bank regularly and on time under the ongoing
operations. For the new project, Interim Un-audited Financial Reports (IFRsfiformerly FMRs-
will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by the due dates. KEGOC will produce a full set o f
IFRs every calendar quarter throughout the l i f e of the loan. The format o f IFRs will be agreed
with KEGOC during negotiations and will include: (i)        Project Sources and Uses o f Funds: (ii)
Uses o f Funds by Project Activity; (iii)Project Balance Sheet; (iv) Designated Account (DA)
Statements; and (v) Statement o f Expenditures (SOE) Withdrawal Schedule. These financial
reports will be submitted to the Bank within 45 days o f the end o f each quarter. The first
quarterly IFRs will be submitted after the end o f the first full quarter following the initial
disbursement.     The   risk associated          with      financial   reporting   is    moderate.

External Audit



                                              47
20.    The audit o f the proposed project, like the other projects implemented by KEGOC, will
be conducted (i) independent private auditors acceptable to the Bank on terms o f reference
                 by
acceptable to the Bank; and (ii)  according to the I S A issued by the International Auditing and
Assurance Standards Board o f the International Federation o f Accountants. KEGOC has been
submitting satisfactory audited entity and project financial statements, with no major issues in
the management letters. Audit o f the subject project will include the project financial
statements, SOEs and DA Statement. The annual audited project financial statements will be
submitted to the Bank within six months o f the end o f each fiscal year and also at the closing o f
the project. The cost o f the audit will be financed from the company's own funds. The risk
associated with external audit i s considered moderate. The following table identifies the audit
reports that will be required to be submitted by the K E G O C together with the due date o f
submission:

21,     Funds Flow and Disbursement Arrangements. The proceeds o f the loan will be
disbursed over a period o f 3.5 years or for such longer period as will be agreed with the Bank.
Loan funds will flow to the project via disbursements to the DA maintained by KEGOC. The
project will follow transaction-based disbursement procedures (payments through the DAY
reimbursement, direct payments and special commitments). Withdrawals from the Loan
Account will be requested in accordance with the guidance to be given in the Disbursement
Letter. Withdrawal applications will be signed by two persons: (i) authorized representative
                                                                     an
o f the Borrower; and (ii)another designated person as authorized by written delegated authority
from the Borrower.

22. Designated Account. To facilitate timely disbursements for eligible expenditures on
works, goods and services, the Borrower will open and operate, under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank, a DA in US$ in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. KEGOC
will be responsible for the appropriate accounting o f the funds deposited into this account, for
reporting o n the use o f these funds and for ensuring that they are included in the audits o f the
financial statements. Ceiling o f the DA will be US$lO.O million. The Minimum Application
size for Direct Payment or Special Commitment will be US$2.0 million.

23.    Applications documenting the advance o f the DA will be made on a quarterly basis.

each; and (iv) individual consultant services estimated to cost greater than US$50,000
equivalent each.       Expenditures against contracts below these limits will use SOEs.
Documentation supporting expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retained by the P M D and
will be available for review when requested by Bank supervision missions and project auditors.

24.   Detailed instructions on withdrawal o f IBRD loan proceeds will be provided in the
Disbursement Letter. The risk associated with funds f l o w and disbursement i s considered low.

Supervision Plan

25.    As part o f the project supervision missions, risk-based FM supervisions will be
conducted at appropriate intervals, depending on the level o f assessed risk. These will pay
particular attention to: (i)
                           project accounting and internal control systems; (ii)   budgeting and
                                     i i review o f IFRs; (iv) review o f audit reports, including
financial planning arrangements; ( i )

                KAZAKHSTAN: Moinak Electricity Transmission Project

General
1.     Procurement for the proposed project will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published in M a y 2004 and
revised in October 2006 (Procurement Guidelines) and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment
o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers'' published in M a y 2004 and revised in October 2006
(Consultant Guidelines) as well as the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement (LA). The
various procurement actions under different expenditure categories are described in general
below. For each contract to be financed under the LA, the various procurement or consultant
selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements,
and time frame have been agreed between the Borrower and the Bank under the Procurement
Plan (PP). The PP will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs. A General Procurement Notice was published in M a y 2009 in UNDB
on-line and in printed version as well as in dgMarket online. Specific Procurement Notices will
be published for all I C B (international competitive bidding) procurement and consulting
contracts as required under the Guidelines.

Assessment o f KEGOC's Capacity to Implement Procurement
 2.    The latest Country Procurement Assessment Report i s dated June 2000. A new Public
 Procurement L a w took effect in Kazakhstan on January 1, 2008. While the new L a w includes
 many provisions that reflect international practices and the Bank's recommendations, it remains
 in need o f further improvement and the country's high procurement risk category remains
 unchanged.

 3.     The project implementing agency i s KEGOC. An assessment o f KEGOC's capacity to
 implement project procurement was carried out by the Bank in December 2008 and the
 assessment report i s available in the Project File. KEGOC has gained substantial experience in
 international procurement through the on-going projects financed by the Bank. The
 procurement work under both projects has been successfully completed. The supply and
 installation arrangement together with prequalification approach have been successful and will
 be adopted for the proposed project as well.

Procurement Risk Assessment
 4.    Based on the assessment o f KEGOC's capacity to implement project procurement the
 overall procurement risk under the proposed project i s rated as moderate. The risks associated
 with procurement and the mitigation measures were identified in the procurement capacity
 assessment and are summarized in Table 1 below:

                                                   51
8.    Selection o f Consultants. Consultants' services to be procured under the project include
procurement and project management consulting services.

 9.   Advance Procurement. Selection o f procurement and project management consultants
will be conducted in advance.

10. Bidding Documents and Evaluation Arrangements. The bidding documents,
including technical specifications, will be prepared by the PMD with assistance from the
procurement and project management consultants. Bid or proposal evaluation will be carried
out by an evaluation team (comprising 4-5 technical specialists). A separate tender committee
(including 6-7 members) will be established by KEGOC to approve procurement decisions
including contract award. The procurement and project management consultants will provide
assistance in the prequalification process and bid evaluation.

 11. Filing and Records Keeping. KEGOC will use i t s existing system (which has been used
 satisfactorily under the on-going projects) to maintain procurement files.

Procurement Plan
 12. KEGOC has developed a PP for the entire project scope consistent with the
 implementation plan, which provides information on procurement packages, procurement
 methods, milestones and Bank review requirements (see Table 2 below). The PP will be agreed
 between KEGOC and the Bank at negotiations and will be available at KEGOC's project
 database and website as well as on the Bank's external website. The PP will be updated in
 agreement with the Bank project team annually or as required to reflect actual project
 implementation needs.

Procurement Supervision
 13. All contracts to be financed by the Bank loan will be subject to Bank prior review. N o
 ex-post review contracts are anticipated. I t is expected that two field supervision missions per
 year will be carried out including procurement supervision and on-site physical inspections.
 Physical inspection will be conducted on at least 10% o f all contracts.

Anti-Corruption Measures
14. The Bank's Anticorruption Guidelines (dated October 15,2006) and the transparency and
disclosure provisions o f the Bank Procurement and Consultant Guidelines will be enforced.
Among others, the following specific actions will be taken:

      0   In addition to the publication o f procurement notices and contract award information as
          required by the Guidelines, all procurement notices and contract award information will
          be published in the country's public procurement bulletin and on KEGOC's website.

          Require each staff involved in procurement, including each member o f the tender or
          evaluation committee, to confirm that his or her involvement does not create any conflict
          o f interest.

          Put in place the necessary mechanisms to ensure that contractors or consultants are paid
          according to their contract terms without any delays.

                          Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis
                  KAZAKHSTAN: Moinak Electricity Transmission Project

Economic Rate o f Return

EIRR: 17.I %, NPV: US$291 million

1.       General Approach. The economic benefits o f the proposed project have to be assessed
in the context o f the overall scheme o f delivering power from the Moinak HPP (MHPP) to
customers in the southern Region. The scope o f costs to be considered therefore extends beyond
those directly associated with the construction and operation o f the new transmission facilities to
include any other capital and operating expenditures required to provide electricity service to the
end user. Benefits must also be viewed from the perspective o f the end-user. These benefits
include the value which the customers attribute to incremental electricity supply which can be
measured in terms o f their observed willingness to pay for electricity. Normally, this would be
measured as the combination o f actual payments (the tariff) and also the consumer surplus
associated with savings in the use o f substitutes for basic energy needs (kerosene, batteries, self-
generation, etc) and the convenience o f access to services that can only be economically
provided with electricity (television, air conditioning, etc.). The methodology usually entails
deriving a demand curve for electricity based on a comparison o f the energy use o f electrified
and non-electrified households. In the case o f southern Kazakhstan, where virtually all
households and businesses have access to grid-based electricity supply, this approach was not
feasible. Consequently the measurement o f willingness to pay took into account the basic tariff,
as well as the costs to customers associated with current and expected future load shedding. In
addition, while the tariff currently makes no distinction between peak and off-peak power, it was
assumed that the peak power provided by M H P P would have an added value to consumers
beyond that indicated by the tariff. The sections below provide details o f the major assumptions
used with respect to the measurement o f project costs and benefits.

2.      Annual Output. Estimated annual output o f the MHPP was provided by the developer,
KazKuat JSC. Total annual energy is estimated to be 1,027 GWh, o f which 48% will be peak
power and the remainder base load. Transmission losses are compensated by KEGOC, so the
same amount o f energy was assumed to be delivered to the distribution networks. Distribution
losses were assumed to be 10%.

3.       Project Costs. Following are the assumptions regarding the project costs:

Capital Costs:

     0   MHPP: Total estimated cost o f the MHPP i s US$340 million, o f which US$20 million
         has been spent to date, leaving 94% o f the costs undisbursed. The capital expenditures to
         completion o f the project were assumed to be spread over the 2009-2012 period at levels
         o f 20%, 40%, 20%, and 14% o f total cost, respectively.




                                                 55
   0   Transmission System: Total estimated cost o f the Moinak transmission facilities i s
       US$68.6 million, o f which US$7.8 million i s VAT which was excluded from the
       economic costs.

Operations and Maintenance.

   0   MHPP: The annual O & M costs o f MHPP were assumed to be 1.5% o f capital costs,
       equivalent to KZT 0.74 per kWh. This i s typical o f experience with hydropower projects
       o f similar size.

       Transmission System: The feasibility study estimates the annual operating cost for the
       transmission facilities at KZT 4.1 million per year for the first 10 years, rising to K Z T
       10.8 million per year after year 10 to cover line overhaul. These estimates were revised
       to include the effect o f the devaluation o f the KZT, on the presumption that the full
       amount o f materials and line overhaul would be affected by the change in exchange rates,
       while labor costs would be unaffected.

   0   Distribution: The long-run marginal costs o f the distribution networks that will transmit
       the electricity to the end users will vary depending on location, loads and the current level
       o f surplus capacity. For purposes o f estimation, it was decided to use the current
       regulated distribution margin for Almaty Oblast, which was calculated as the difference
       between the customer tariff and the tariffs for generation and transmission. In 2008, this
       was K Z T 2.8kWh. This figure was also adjusted for the change in exchange rates. The
       resultant unit cost o f distribution was KZT 3.6kWh.

4.      Project Benefits. Benefits to electricity consumers were measured as the sum o f three
           the
factors: (i) end user tariff; (ii) avoided cost o f measures taken to deal with load shedding;
                                  the
and (iii) premium for additional availability o f peak power. A fourth category o f benefit was
         a
also estimated, the avoided CO;! emissions from displacing thermal generation with hydro.

   0   Tariff: The end-user tariff in the southern Region i s KZT 9.45 per kWh. This i s the
       observed minimum willingness o f all customers to pay for electricity supply.

   0   Compensation for Load Shedding: In the Almaty power region, consumption restrictions
       ranged from 50 M W to 80 M W during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 winter periods.
       During the 2008-2009 winter, supply restrictions in southern Kazakhstan were as high as
       230-360 M W . The feasibility study estimated the level and duration o f the load shed at
       70 M W for 90 hours per year. The capacity shortfall was expected to rise to over 300
       M W by the time the MHPP comes on line, which would definitely increase the level o f
       load shedding and also possibly the duration. While recent events suggest a contraction
       in economic growth, the high level o f load shed experienced during the past winter
       suggests that the forecast in the feasibility study i s reasonable. To estimate the benefits
       o f MHPP generation capacity, it was assumed that the plant would eliminate 300 M W o f
       load shedding. The benefit to customers o f avoided load shedding was estimated to be
       equivalent to the variable cost (primarily fuel) o f diesel generation. This measure was
       selected based on the fact that heavy industry (including transport) represents half o f the
       consumption in the southern region, and that these customers are likely to have backup

                                                56
         generation when grid supply is unreliable. With diesel priced at KZT 1 2 0 4 and
         consumables assumed to be 5% o f fuel cost, the cost to consumers is KZT 43.3kWh.

     0   Premium for Peak Power: At present, there is a single price in the Southern Region for
         all electricity supply, regardless o f whether it i s peak or off-peak. There is, however, a
         distinction at the generation level between the two. Peak power from the MHPP will be
         priced at a premium o f 54%. While there i s no empirical evidence that customers would
         be willing to pay a premium for peak power, it is the norm in many utilities to charge a
         higher price during peak seasonshours, and customers accept the added cost. It was
         therefore assumed that willingness to pay for the peak power supplied by MHPP would
         carry the same percentage premium over the tariff as that applied to generation.

         Reduction in C02 Emissions: In the absence o f the MHPP, the least-cost method o f
         meeting the region's energy needs would be the construction and operation o f additional
         thermal plants, including both base load and peaking facilities. The fuel which would be
         consumed to match the output o f MHPP is estimated to yield in the order o f 1.0-1.3
         million tons per year o f C02 emissions. Avoided C02 emissions were valued based on
         the recent average price o f carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism,
         US$13.50 per ton.

 5.      Base Case EIRR. Using the inputs and assumptions discussed above, the EIRR o f the
 overall project to deliver power from MHPP to customers in the Southern Region (including the
 transmission investments to be financed under the current loan), i s estimated at 17.19%. The
 N P V o f the project i s US$291 million, at a social discount rate o f 8%.

 6.       Risk Assessment. The planned scheme for power delivery from MHPP i s subject to all
 o f the standard risks applicable to large capital investments. These include (i)   risks o f capital
 cost over-runs on the construction o f the power plant and/or the transmission links; (ii)   risks o f
 delays in completion; and (iii)   risks that future demand, and hence future benefits, are over-
 estimated. An added risk inherent in hydropower projects relates to the variability o f inflows
 into the reservoir. Extended periods o f l o w flows can significantly reduce both the capacity and
 energy output o f the hydropower plant.

 7.     A switching value assessment was carried out with respect to capital cost over-runs and
 completion delays, as well as with respect to the reductions in the total energy output o f the
 hydropower plant. The results, expressed as the amount o f change that could be accommodated
 without reducing the project's EIRR below 8%, are summarized in the table below.


I Catital Cost                                     I                      +86%                            I

I Output from MHPP                                           57% (annual output 442 GWh)

 8.      The switching analysis indicates that the EIRR i s fairly robust in terms o f sensitivity to
 the primary risk factors.

 Financial Rate o f Return

                                                  57
FIRR: 13.3%, NPV: US38.8 million

9.      General Approach. The FIRR analysis was carried out from the perspective o f KEGOC
and limited, therefore, to the incremental costs and revenues associated with the proposed
transmission investments. Capital expenditures and operating and maintenance costs are
described in the section on economic costs, although the costs used in the financial analysis
included VAT. KEGOC will also incur additional costs to compensate for transmission losses
on the volumes o f energy transferred. Loss compensation i s discussed in greater detail below.

10.     Incremental Revenues. Financial benefits o f the project include revenues for
incremental transmission services as well as incremental dispatch. Annual transmission/
dispatch volumes are based on the MHPP output assumptions given above. The tariffs to be paid
to KEGOC are from the 2009-2020 Development Plan (DP), converted to real 2008 price levels
using the projected local inflation rate. The DP anticipates real increases in tariffs over the next
3 years. Beyond 201 1, the analysis assumed that tariffs would remain constant in real terms.

11.     Cost Savings for Loss Compensation. KEGOC will also benefit financially from
access to low-cost hydroelectric energy. It i s KEGOC's practice to cover the cost o f
transmission losses on deliveries o f electricity from suppliers to consumers. If a contract calls
for the delivery o f 100 M W h to a customer and transmission losses are 5%, KEGOC will
purchase 5 MWh from generators and deliver the full contracted supply to the end-user.
KEGOC has agreed with the MHPP developer to purchase approximately 350 GWh o f energy
per year from the HPP which it will use for loss compensation. The MHPP tariff for this energy
i s approximately 25% lower than the current wholesale market price, which i s expected to yield
future net savings o f US$l.9 million per year.

12.    Base-Case FIRR. Based on the above assumptions, the estimated FIRR o f the Moinak
Transmission Project i s 13.3%. The NPV i s US$38.8 million, at a discount rate o f 6.7%, which
approximates KEGOC's real average weighted cost o f capital.

Financial Performance of Borrower

 13.    Current Financial Performance. The IBRD loan will be provided directly to KEGOC,
with a guarantee by the GOK. KEGOC's financial performance has shown steady improvement
over the past 5 years. Pre-tax profits in 2008 totaled US$48 million on total sales o f US$257
million. Cash on hand at the end o f 2008 totaled US$lOO million thanks in part to an equity
injection o f US$35 million from SamrukKazyna (the sole shareholder o f KEGOC) and a further
US$25 million equity injection from the GOK budget. KEGOC is, and has consistently been in
compliance with financial performance covenants under the two existing IBRD loans.

14.    Projected Financial Performance.16 The Bank's financial model for KEGOC was used
to prepare projections o f the company's financial performance for the period through to 2013.
Key assumptions used in the model are as follows:

l6 The financial projections have been made by the Bank's project team and do not imply KEGOC's endorsement.
The projections include a number o f assumptions which are subject to change. Therefore, the projections will be
revised by the Bank's project supervision team on an annual basis based on updated information and assumptions.

                                                      58
   0   KEGOC's capital investment program i s based on KEGOC's draft Development Plan
       (DP) for 2009-2020. In addition to completion o f the first Rehabilitation Project and the
       N / S line, major projects include (i)Moinak transmission (US$69 million); (ii) Alma
                                                                                       new
       SS (US$250 million); (iii)      second transmission rehabilitation (US$360 million); (iv)
       Ossakarovka OHTL reconstruction (US$57 million), and (v) rehabilitation and
       reconstruction o f depreciated equipment (US$145 million).

       The financing plan for the capital investment projects i s based on arrangements already in
       place or contemplated (loan financing for the Alma substation).

   0   Transmission and dispatch tariffs were assumed to increase in accordance with the
       proposals given in the draft 2009-2020 DP. While the tariffs have not yet been approved
       by ARNM, the tariff-setting rules have been consistently applied so far. Projected
       transmissioddispatch volumes through to 2020 were also taken from the DP.

   0   Taxation rates were based on Kazakh regulations. Depreciation rates were based on
       KEGOCs approved accounting practices. Deferred income tax was estimated based on
       the difference between depreciation rates allowed for income tax and those used in the
       corporate accounts.

15.    The resulting financial projections are summarized in table below. Pro forma financial
statements are included at the end o f this Annex. Note that all projections o f financial
performance are expressed in nominal K Z T and hence include projected local inflation. Recent
forecasts suggest that this will average 8% per annum over the period o f analysis.

Notes: (i) self-financing ratio reflects the company's ability to self-finance capital investments through internal cash
generation and equity investments; it does not reflect actual s e l f financing which would be a function o f the
availability and use o f debt; and (ii) negative figures (debt service and capital investment) reflect the fact that these
are cash outflows.

16.     2009 i s expected to present some financial challenges for the company, as the company's
debt service obligations as well as planned capital investments rise sharply, while profits are
expected to be negative. Debt service i s expected to increase from KZT 2.5 billion in 2008 to
K Z T 9.6 billion in 2009, owing to the revaluation o f the K Z T and also the expiration o f the grace
period on earlier loans. Capital investments are projected to increase from K Z T 18.3 billion to
KZT 28.9 billion, o f which KZT 15.1 billion i s to be funded from internal resources. However,
the company started the year with cash on hand o f approximately KZT 12 billion, which, when
combined with projected operating cash flow, and new borrowings provides a sufficient reserve
to cover expected obligations. In addition, SamrukKazyna has committed to provide an
additional KZT 2.7 billion o f equity financing in order to maintain the company's liquidity.

17.     Over the medium term, KEGOC's financial outlook i s satisfactory in terms o f
profitability (apart from the projected loss in 2009), self-financing and leverage. Except for
2009, year-on-year debt service coverage i s also satisfactory. However, cash flow deficits are
anticipated in 4 o f the next 5 years owing to rising capital investments and debt service
obligations. While accumulated cash together with planned equity injections are sufficient to
maintain the company's liquidity through 2009, forecasts indicate a risk that cash balances will
fall below zero in 2010, and the current ratio w i l l drop to unacceptably l o w levels. If these cash
shortfalls materialize, KEGOC will need to draw on the parent company's commitment to
provide additional equity in order to maintain liquidity and/or adjust i t s capital investment
program to accommodate cash flow constraints.

18.     While the financial projections indicate a need for careful monitoring o f KEGOC's
ongoing financial performance, they do not yet suggest an urgent need for remedial action. The
weaknesses in the company's financial outlook are closely tied to the current slow-down in the
Kazakh economy, which in turn i s linked to the global recession and decline in commodity
prices. At present, there are no clear signs as to the timing o f a recovery, and the projections
have therefore taken a conservative position, with KEGOC's transmission volumes only
recovering to their 2008 levels in 2013. This may be unduly pessimistic, but in the event that it
proves to be true and liquidity i s jeopardized, remedies are available in the form o f either
drawing on commitments for additional equity or delaying capital investments.

 19.    Financial Covenants.          The financial projections assume that tariff discounts on
transmission services w i l l not affect the financial viability o f KEGOC. At present, discounts are
granted primarily for electricity exports and international transit to Russia, which are transmitted
over under-utilized lines and which, based on existing power prices in Russia, would not be
viable at the full transmission tariff. These exports are expected to decrease once the new N / S
interconnector i s completed, as surplus generation capacity in the north i s transferred to markets
in southern Kazakhstan. To ensure that any future discounts do not threaten KEGOC's financial


                                                             60
viability, a covenant in the LA will provide that KEGOC shall not grant tariff discounts on
transmission services except for those that are based on commercial considerations of the
company. In no case shall discounts be granted for transmission volumes which would either
displace higher-revenue volumes or require new investments in transmission capacity.

20.    The following financial performance covenants will be included in the LA: (i)       maintain a
current ratio o f 1.0; (ii) maintain a self-financing ratio o f 20% based on a three-year moving
average o f the investment program; and (iii)      refrain from incurring additional debt unless the
debt service ratio, as measured by current net revenues and maximum future debt service
requirements, i s at least 1.2. In addition, in the Guarantee Agreement the ROK shall ensure that
KEGOC's tariffs are maintained at levels sufficient to fully cover the company's prudently
incurred operating costs, as well as a regulated rate o f return on fixed assets employed.

                 KAZAKHSTAN: Moinak Electricity Transmission Project

1.      Environmental Management. The project i s in full compliance with environmental
assessment (EA) regulations o f the ROK and World Bank safeguard policies for Environmental
Assessment (OP 4.01). Because o f the limited nature, extent and duration o f any potential
environmental impacts, the project has been assigned Category B under OP 4.01. Consistent
with this rating, KEGOC prepared an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which was
disclosed on i t s website on December 29, 2008. The EMP was also deposited in the Bank's
InfoShop on January 16, 2009. A revised EMP was disclosed on KEGOC's website and in the
Bank's InfoShop on June 26, 2009. The feasibility study included a section on environmental
protection. This was approved by the competent environmental authorities o f the GOK. A
public consultation was held on November 14, 2008, in Almaty with the participation o f a wide
range o f stakeholders, including those in the vicinity o f the project sites and NGOs.

2.       Key environmental issues under the project include the normal construction issues
associated with the movement o f men, machines and materials, dust, noise, engine exhausts,
disposal o f solid (non-hazardous) wastes mostly from packaging and land preparation. In
addition, there will be issues associated with location and operation o f worker camps
(wastewater, sewage, etc.), crossing o f rivers by OHTLs and land clearing. During operation, the
chief issues are public health and safety associated with exposure to electromagnetic fields.
Land clearing and vegetative removal w i l l be performed by mechanical or manual means; no
pesticides w i l l be used. Substation exclusion areas and OHTL right-of-ways (ROWS) w i l l be
designed so that the maximum electridmagnetic field strengths at the plant fence or at the edge
o f the ROW are within internationally accepted standards.

3.      The two project substations and the OHTL routes are located in remote areas on land of
marginal agricultural value or used for cattle grazing. There are no sites or locations o f cultural
value. Furthermore, routing o f the OHTLs w i l l not intersect flight routes o f migratory birds. In
June 2009, a local design company (Energostroyproyekt) has developed the preliminary line
routing for the two transmission lines (pre-final design stage) as shown on the map (Annex 15).
After formal approval o f this line routing, the survey, geological and hydrological works will be
performed by a company to be engaged by KEGOC. Results o f this work will be input into the
detailed working designs for the OHTLs (developed by the turnkey contractor to be selected in
or around July 2010). The detailed designs w i l l have a section on EA, which i s subject to the
state environmental expertise. This w i l l include an updated version o f the EMP reflecting
specific mitigation and monitoring requirements based on information from the EA. The
detailed design stage includes the requirement o f holding another public consultation for the
project. Once the detailed final designs are approved, the Ministry o f Industry and Trade issues
the permit for construction.

4.    The Bank will thoroughly examine the detailed designs, including the EA and updated
EMP, to verify that Bank safeguard requirements are satisfied. Furthermore, under the Loan
Agreement the Borrower shall ensure that the OHTLs will not encroach upon any part o f the
Charyn and Altyn-Emel Specially Protected Natural Areas.

5.      KEGOC's institutional capacity for implementing requirements specified in the EMP i s
satisfactory. Under the two Bank-supported transmission projects, KEGOC's environmental
management performance has been found to be highly satisfactory.

       6.         Land Acquisition. N o physical displacement o f people will take place under the project.
       C i v i l works at the existing Shelek SS and Robot SS will be carried out within existing fence
       lines, not requiring new land acquisition. However, land will need to be expropriated for the
       Moinak HPP switchyard (about 4 hectares or 8.7 acres) and for the OHTL towers (about 8.1
       hectares or 17.6 acres). Land is to be acquired by KEGOC through a special government land
       fund with compensation to the affected ownershsers. Since the exact number o f towers that will
       be built and the exact final location o f the OSY at the MHPP are unknown at this point in time
       and will follow from the detailed working designs during the first year o f implementation (after
       selection o f the turn-key contractor), the exact scope and incidence o f all land acquisition
       requirements cannot be precisely assessed now. Therefore, under the applicable Bank safeguard
       policy (OP/BP 4.12), a L A P F was prepared, which was approved by the Bank. Once the final
       working designs are accepted, KEGOC will prepare a specific Land Acquisition Plan (LAP) and
       submit it to the Bank for approval before proceeding with construction. An LAP will be
       prepared by the Borrower prior to the commencement o f any construction works under the
       project.

        7.     Dam Safety. The Moinak HPP is not part o f the proposed transmission investment.
       Nonetheless, it is considered to be a "connected" project in the sense that performance o f the
       HPP would directly influence performance o f the Bank-supported transmission investment. In
       this context, dam safety i s o f particular importance.

        8.     The dam i s located on the Charyn River.17 D a m design was subject to Soviet EA
        procedures and received Soviet Ecological Expertise approval in 1985. Construction started in
        1986 but stopped in 1992 because o f lack o f funds. Funds were secured in 2005. In the interim,
        Kazakhstan had developed EA regulations and the Ministry o f Environment approved the
        updated environmental section o f the dam feasibility study in 2006. The detailed design was sent
        to the Ministry o f Environment for review. A public consultation was held on July 17, 2008 on
        the HPP and dam complex. The dam project has complied with all GOK EA regulations.

        9.      Because the dam is considered a "connected" project under Bank safeguard policies, the
        Bank engaged an independent dam safety expert to perform a due diligence assessment o f the
        Moinak dam's compliance with O P B P 4.37. The assessment concluded that the dam was
        designed by qualified engineers and an experienced firm. The drawings are o f high quality with
        sufficient details and quantitative calculations. The independent dam safety expert verified that
        the dam design, construction and proposed operation are consistent with the OP/BP 4.37.




" The dam complex includes a small downstream "compensating reservoir" ("counter-dam") component to assure adequate water
flow to protect a stand o f ash trees downstream on the Charyn River.
