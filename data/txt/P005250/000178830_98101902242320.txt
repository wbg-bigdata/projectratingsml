INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
FOR A SECOND POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for the equivalent of US$5.0 mil-
lion, on standard IDA terms, to help finance the Second Power Project. The
proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Jordan Electricity Authority
(JEA) for 25 years, including 3-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Jordan in January 1974, and its report
entitled "Current Economic Position of Jordan", (#479a-JO dated November 5,
1974,) was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 15, 1974.
Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Before the 1967 war with Israel, the Jordanian economy grew at
about 8 percent per year in real terms. Price stability prevailed, and high
levels of foreign assistance sustained a high level of investment and a surplus
in the balance of payments. However, Jordan's economy was adversely affected
by the 1967 war and the confrontation with the Palestinian Fedayeen groups in
1970/71. The occupation of the West Bank, with 30 percent of Jordan's popula-
tion, deprived the country of about 40 percent of its GNP, and over 200,000
refugees emigrated to the East Bank. Growth of agriculture, tourism, and in-
dustry was curtailed, and the economy's dependence on external transfers in-
creased. The latter, together with net factor income from abroad, accounted
for about a quarter of GNP since 1969. In 1970/71, the Government's efforts
to check the activity of Palestinian guerillas provoked economic sanctions
against Jordan by some Arab countries. Jordan was particularly affected
by the closure of the Jordanian-Syrian border from July 1971 to November 1972,
which resulted in a decrease in exports from $41 million in 1969 to. $32 mil-
lion in 1971, bv the suspension of budget support from Kuwait and Libya after
1970, and by the closure of the Syrian-Lebanese frontier during the first half
of 1973.  Following the October 1973 war and an Arab summit conference at
Rabat of 1974, more financial aidl from OAPEC sources was granted to Jordan.
4.        After a period of economic stagnation from 1967 to 1970, signs of
economic recovery began to appear in the second half of 1971, with agricultural
output recovering to the level of 1967. In 1974, agriculture recovered
sharply from the drought of 1973. Industry picked up in 1972, and reached
almost full capacity utilization In 1973. In 1974 industrial production is
estimated to have grown by over 6 percent. Exports of goods rose sharply



-2-
from $32 million in 1971 to $58 million in 1973, and are estimated at over
S150 million in 1974, reflecting increased phosphates prices. Overall economic
growth is likely to have reached 8 percent in real terms in 1974, partly
due to the recovery of agricultural production from a bad crop in 1973. With
the reopening of the Syrian frontiers with both Lebanon and Jordan in mid-1973,
an improved domestic political situation, and a revival of private investment,
the economy of Jordan has good prospects for renewed growth. A five-fold
increase in phosphate prices since 1972 and an expected expansion in phosphates
production from 1 million tons in 1973 to 3 million tons in 1975 (and to 8
million tons by 1980) have improved the balance of payments prospects. In-
creased costs of oil requirements may be expected to be offset by a correspond-
ing increase in royalties from oil pipeline through-put. However, since
imports represent more than 40 percent of GNP, the economy remains strongly
affected by increases of world prices.
5.        The return of internal stability in 1971 permitted the Government
to devote more attention to medium- and long-term economic issues. The
planning machinery was reactivated with the establishment of the National
Planning Council (NPC), in late 1971, and of coordination committees with
the private sector. As a first step, a Three Year Plan (1973-75) was prepared,
which aims at achieving an 8 percent annual rate of growth with relative price
stability; creating new jobs in an attempt to reduce the 8 percent unemployment
rate and the serious underemployment in the East Bank; and improving manpower
skills through vocational and technical education. The Plan also aims at
fostering a more equitable distribution of economic: gains between the various
income groups and geographical regions, mainly through rural development and
improvement of housing and public services; and at phasing out the economy's
heavy dependence on foreign budget support by reducing the budget and trade
deficits through increased domestic revenues and foreign exchange earnings.
6.        The Plan envisages a thorough restructuring of the economy by reduc-
ing its heavy reliance on services (about two-thirds of GDP), and on defense
(about 22 percent of GDP in 1973), and by developing agriculture, manufactur-
ing and mining, both through institutional and infrastructure support to pri-
vate initiative and through public investment in production enterprises if
needed. In agriculture, which accounts for about 19 percent of GDP, one-third
of commodity exports and 30 percent of employment, emphasis is placed on dev-
elopment of irrigation and, to a lesser extent, on improvement of rainfed
farming to exploit the substantial potential for export--especially citrus
and other fruits--and for import substitution of wheat aand meat. Support of
manufacturing and mining, which account for about 14 percent of GDP, 7 percent
of employment and two-thirds of commodity exports (half of which are phos-
phates), aims at making production more competitive and export-oriented,
particularly to neighboring countries; developing fertilizer production based
on the country's phosphate reserves; increasing the production of Jordan's
high quality phosphate rock; and exploiting the country's deposits of potash
and copper. Four large projects, in phosphates, potash, fertilizer and copper
production, aim at reducing budget and trade deficits by generating substan-
tial foreign exchange earnings.



7.        The plan anticipated an aggregate investment of $557 million from
1973 to 1975. However, the achievement in the first two years was somewhat
slower than was expected. Public investments were 49 percent of what was
planned in 1973 and 1974, and private sector investment was 46 percent of the
target during the same period. External financing accounted for 44 percent
of total investment for 1973 and 1974: 59 percent for the public sector, and
12 percent for the private sector. While investments in transportation and
agriculture were about 75 percent of the planned target on the average, in-
vestments in the social sectors such as education and health were very slow
(less than 20 percent). The public sector's performance is expected to improve
in 1975. Budgetary funds were earmarked to compensate for the shortfalls of
the previous twxo vears, in addition to meeting the original target for 1975.
8.        The pattern of external assistance to Jordan in the recent past has
largely been influenced by the unsettled conditions of the region. Transfers
to the Government, mostly in the form of budgetary support and military aid,
averaged $140 million per year during 1967-73. Under the Khartoum Agreement,
Jordan received subsidies amounting to about $105 million annually from Kuwait,
Libya and Saudi Arabia in 1967-69.   Saudi Arabia maintained financial assis-
tance in 1970 and increased its aid from $40 million to $64 million in 1972.
Substantial US transfers (around $60 million in both 1972 and 1973) compensated
for the suspension after 1970 of the payments from Kuwait and Libya; Kuwait
resumed its support in April 1973, raising total official transfers received
by Jordan to $179 million in that year. In 1974, budget support amounted to
$168 million, mainly from the Arab countries ($123 million), but also from
the USA ($45 million). It also received $28 million in development loans
in 1974, of which Kuwait provided $3 million, Federal Republic of Germany
$14 million, and IDA around $5 million.
9.        The new emphasis on development and an extensive project list pre-
sented in the Plan have helped to increase development aid. New commitments
over 1972-73 amounted to $137 million, mostly from Western sources, Kuwait anid
IDA. Average terms on $92 million committed in 1973 were about I percent
interest, 7 years of grace and 30 years maturity. The gross inflow of long-
and medium-term capital to the central and local governments, which had
averaged $10 million per year during 1967-70, increased to an average of mtore
than $30 million annually after 1970.   The external public debt, including
undisbursed amounts, was about $325 million at the end of 1973, of which about
13 percenit was held by the Bank Group. The outstanding and disbursed debt at
the end of 1973 was estimated at $225 million. Because of the concessional
terms, the debt service ratio was low, at 6.5 percent in 1974. Nonetheless,
because of the difficult development problems arising from the country's
still unexploited natural resources, serious underemployment, and the progres-
sive reorientation of the economy which is likely to follow the development
of new centers of economic activity and possibly a peace settlement, Jordan
still needs a substantial part of external assistance on concessional terms.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
10.       Jordan has to date received ten IDA credits totalling $53.8 million
(net of cancellations). Four credits were made before 1967--two for agri-
cultural credit ($6.0 million) and two for water supply ($5.4 million)-- and
are fully disbursed. War and local disturbances adversely affected the pace
of economic development and Bank Group lending resumed in mid-1971. Credits
were made for a highway project ($6 million) in 1971; a first education proj-
ect ($5.4 million) in 1972, and a second one $6.0 million) in 1975; a power
project ($10.2 million) in 1973, a water supply project ($8.7 million) in
1973, and an Irrigation project ($7.5 million) in 1974. Performance under
these projects is generally satisfactory. An engineering credit to initiate
the potash project is being prepared and would be presented to the Executive
Directors before the end of the current fiscal year. IFC made two investments
in Jordan consisting of a $224,000 equity participation and a $1.6 million
loan to Jordan Ceramic Industries Limited (JCI) in 1974, and also a $3.2 mil-
lion equity participation in the promotion of a phosphatic fertilizer project.
Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits and IFC investment as of
April 30, 1975, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
11.       Last year, the Government requested Bank assistance in formulating,
implementing and mobilizing multilateral financing for a package of develop-
ment projects in the Rift Valley. This region includes the largest portion
of Jordan's resources which are critical to the future improvements in the
balance of payments and in incomes and living standards. Large mining proj-
ects in phosphate, potash and copper, a phosphatic fertilizer project, and
the related port and railway development are included in the package, as well
as further development of the water resources of the Jordan Valley and the
region south of the Dead Sea. These developments, together with the estab-
lishment of industrial zones and supporting services for light manufacturing
and tourism in other parts of the country, would contribute to reduce the
present trend of excessive concentration of economic activities in the Amman-
Zarqa area. Preparatory studies are also underway for projects in rainfed
areas which would expand cereal and livestock production and reduce the
country's dependence on agricultural imports. In view of the magnitude of
the new investments contemplated and of Jordan's reliance on external financ-
ing for the bulk of them, the Bank has requested the Government to review this
program in the framework of the current three-year Plan so as to establish
priorities in light of the financial resources likely to be available. This
review has been initiated by Government and the results are being incorporated
in the next Five Year Plan (11976-1980) now under preparation.
12.       Since 1973, the Bank has been acting as Executing Agency to a three-
year UNDP Planning Assistance Project based in the National Planning Council.
The planning team has been working with the NPC on project preparation and ap-
praisal. The Bank is also acting as Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed
study of industrial investmenl: opportunities and industrial estates in Jordan.

PART III - THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
13.       There are no coal deposits nor any known deposits of oil in Jordan.
The only indigenous energy resources are (a) small hydro-power potential of
about 5-MW on the Zarqa River, which is associated with an irrigation program
for the Jordan Valley where a dam is being constructed (the execution of the
power component, however, has not yet been considered pending further study
of its justification); and (b) development of about 50-MW of hydro-power
potential on the Yarmuk River in North Jordan, also associated with Jordan
Valley irrigation. The Government is expected to engage consultants soon
for the final feasibility study of the latter development. Oil is the main
source of commercial energy and is partly imported under an agreement with
the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company (Tapline) for the transit of oil from
Saudi Arabia through Jordan to the Mediterranean. The oil is conveyed by
pipe from Tapline to the Jordan Refinery, located at 7.arqa, in which the
Government has majority shareholding. Presently Jordan's entire power require-
ments is met by diesel stations operating on gas oil and residual oil.
14.       Jordan's total installed electric power generating capacity is about
125 MW, including about 40 MW is captive plant (auto producers). The present
rate of growth of electricity consumption is about 15 percent per annum. Pub-
lic electTicity supplies in northern Jordan are provided by the Jordan Electri-
city Company (JEPCO) and the Irbid District Electricity Company (IDECO), both
private Jordanian companies. The number of consumers served by JEPCO and
IDECO as of September 1974 was about 113,300, of whom 86,400 or 76% were sup-
plied by JEPCO and 26,900 or 24% by IDECO. JEPCO supplies the area with the
greatest growth potential, including the capital city of Amman and the Zarqa
industrial area. The area supplied by IDECO is mainly agriculturally oriented,
In southern Jordan, electricity supply Is provided by isolated undertakings,
the largest public one being the Aqaba Port Authority which supplies a peak
demand of about 3 MW. Some users are generating their own energy. The
largest plants are at the Jordan Cement company (14 M;), near Amman, the
Jordan Oil Refinery at Zarqa (4.8-M;), and at the Jordan Phosphate Company,
which has a load of some 5 MW near its mine at Al Hasa in the south. There
are a number of small private plants, nome of which are used for emergency
standby only. In the Jordan Valley, there are thought to be about 200 small
pumping stations, mostly operated by small individual diesel sets, aggregating
at least 1,500 kW. In 1967, the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA) was estab-
lished by Law No. 21 to provide for a coordinated developmenc of the power
sector and the country's power resources. The various regional power produc-
tion companies are under its general authority.
15.       The national development program is well defined.    In the northern
sector, IDECO would complete by mid-1975 the construction of a new power
station with an installed capacity of about 9 MW and continue to expand its
30-kV networks including the connection to the Jordan Valley in the north.



JEA would complete its 132-kV transmission system, financed with UK develop-
ment funds, linking Zarqa with the Amman ring, and JEPCO would further expand
its 30 kV system including the connection to the Jordan Valley in the south.
Demand is expected to exceed JEPCO's firm capacity in 1975 despite commission-
ing of a third 6-MW diesel unit in the Marqa station, and JEA would meet
JEPCO's peaking requirements for 1975/76 with the gas turbine financed under
Credit 386-JO. By mid-1976, JEA would meet most of JFPCO's requirements from
the Hussein Thermal Station. In order to continue to meet this commitment,
the proposed project should be completed in 1978. JEA's 1974-1978 development
program, together with its cost, is shown in Annex III. It amounts to JD 35.1
million (US$108.8 million), of which the first IDA power project constitutes
about 23% and the second proposed project about 20%. JEA's 1974-80 program
includes (a) completion of the new Hussein Tnermal Station at Zarqa and the
132-kV facilities around Amman (1967/77); (b) the Project and some reinforce-
ment of the 132-kV facilities in the Amman area (1977/78); (c) the fourth
unit (66-MW) at the Hussein station and 24-MW in gas turbine capacity, to-
gether with 220 km of 132-kV lines linking Irbid to Amman, and El Hasa in the
south to the northern grid (1978/79); and (d) a fifth unit (66-MW) and fur-
ther transmission expansion (1980/81). JEA's total investment program through
1978 is about $108.8 million. After 1976, JEA is expected to meet all local
costs of expansion from internal cash generation and Government equity, but
foreign loans of about $76.5 million would be needed to meet the remaining
external financing of the investment program.
16.       In the southwestern part of the country, rapid developments are
expected to take place including the expansion of the El Hasa phosphate mines
requiring about 10 MW in additional capacity in 1978 and a further 20 MW in
1980; the construction of a potash plant (17 MW) at the southern end of the
Dead Sea; the opening of a copper mine east of Shan (5 MW); the construction
of a fertilizer plant (10 MW), a cement plant (20 MW) and a glass factory
(0.6 MW) in the area of Ma'an; the development of tourist facilities through-
out the area, including Aqaba, requiring about 1 MW; and the improvement of
present power facilities in towns and a rural development plan in the Karak
area. In view of the relatively large industrial requirements, JEA has re-
quested IDA to finance from the proposed credit a long-term power development
study for southern Jordan (including the possibilities of future connection
of the area to the northern system); the study should be completed before
March 31, 1976.
17.       The Government intends to conduict a final study of the multipurpose
project on the Yarmuk River on the border with Syria. A feasibility study was
completed in the mid-sixties but further progress was impossible in the after-
math of the 1967 war.   Jordan and Syria aare expected to renew the agreement
embodied in their treaty of 1953 on the use of waters for irrigation and on
the construction of a dam and power station. Since power operation would
depend on the requirements for irrigation and a large part of the power would
be reserved for Syria, the power benefits for Jordan cannot be assessed at
this stage.  Because the countries are also studying the possibility of inter-
connecting their respective power systems, which could have a major effect on
Jordan's requirements for transmission lines (includ:[ng the Yarmuk plant con-
nerting line), these developments are in too early a stage to be included in
the present development program. In anv event, the hydro station would not
be completed before the end of this decade.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
18.       A detailed description of the proposed project is given in the
report entitled "Appraisal of the Second Hussein Thermal Power Project,"
dated May 23, 1975, which is being distributed separately. A Credit and
Project Summary ls attached as Annex III. A map showing the location of the
project is also attached. Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in
Washington from May 19 to 21, 1975. The Jordanian Delegation was headed by
Mr. Ali El Nousour, General Manager, Jordan Electricity Authority.
Background
19.       The Government first requested IDA's assistance in financing the
Hussein Thermal Power Station in 1969. The U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) had previously assisted in financing a feasibility study
for this project, which was to be operated in conjunction with a proposed
hydroelectric power station at Shuneh on the Yarmuk River, and a 138-kV
transmission system interconnecting Amman, Jerusalem, Nablus and Irbid. Sub-
sequently, the envisaged expansion had to be modified because of the June 1967
war and the civil disturbances in 1970 and 1971. The first project (386-JO)
was appraised in June 1971, but the Association concluded that construction
of the steam plant would be premature: it was then re-appraised by the Asso-
ciation and the Kuwait Fund in 1972, on the basis of an updated feasibility
study prepared by the Kulijian Corporation of the United States. A $10.2 mil-
lion Credit (386-JO) was signed in 1973 and the first power project is being
financed jointly (50/50) with the Kuwait Fund. It comprises two 33-MW steam
electric units and one 12-MW gas turbine generator unit at the Hussein Station
(near Amman). Although there were some initial delays, the project is now
progressing satisfactorily; the gas turbine is scheduled to be commissioned
shortly, and the steam unit in 1976, nearly on schedule. The proposed project
includes adding a third 33-MW unit to the Hussein station whose capacity may
ultimately reach some 200 MW.
Beneficiary: Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA)
20.       The JEA is responsible to the Minister of National Economy and its
principal functions are: (a) to establish generating and transmission facil-
ities to supply energy in bulk to distributors whose systems are connected to
the JEA system; (b) to manage and operate any facilities transferred to or
acquired by JEA; and (c) to develop the supply of electricity in areas where
there is an economic demand and which are not within the area of supply
designated in concessions to other companies. Existing power stations may
be designated by JEA as "selected power stations" to operate under JEA's
direction. Subject to Cabinet approval, these power stations may either be
purchased by agreement with the owners, or the energy produced may be bought
by JEA at a cost sufficient to cover the owner's operating costs. JEA may
require that power stations connected to the system but not designated as
"selected power stations" and not considered to be economically justified for
continued generation cease operation. JEA may also purchase any of the other



- 8 -
electricity undertakings in Jordan by agreement with the owners subject to the
Cabinet's consent.
21.       JEA has not yet operated as an electricity supply undertaking; it
presently channels Government loans for power development to JEPCO and IDECO
and supervises the expansion of generation facilities and the 33-kV distribu-
tion networks in the Amman and Irbid areas, the Jordan Valley and other major
towns in the country. JEA is expected to sell small quantities of energy from
the gas turbine in 1974 and 1975, but JEA's operations as a utility company
will not really start until 1976 with the coming into service of the steam
generating units at the Hussein station financed by Credit 386-JO. Initially,
JEA would supply power in bulk to JEPCO and two other large consumers but by
1978/79 would also meet power requirements in Irbid (IDRCO). In order to
prepare for carrying out its new operational functions, JEA has contracted
consultants for a management study to train Jordanian personnel and provide
supervisory staff for the power station.
Project Description
22.       Together with the first IDA project, the Project would assist JEA's
developing as an efficient public bulk supply utility providing economic and
reliable service and removing capacity shortages. It consists of the fol-
lowing:
(a) A third 33-MW steam-electric unit to be installed at the
Hussein Power Station at Zarqa, a site which has existing
access facilities, adequate supply of ground water, and
is adjacent to the oil refinery which will supply fuel.
(b) Reconditioning of diesel units at JEPCO's 38-MW power station
at Marqa and adding radiator cooling to them. The Marqa
station would eventually form part of the standby reserve for
the Hussein station after 1980.
(c) A Power DeveloDment Study for southern Jordan which would
evaluate existing developments and future plans for industrial,
agricultural, tourist, rural, and urban developments in the
area, and prepare forecasts of demand for the period 1976-85.
Project Cost and Financing
23.       The total estimated cogt of the proposed project, excluding interest
during construction, is $22.0 mlllion, including a foreign exchange component
of $17.3 million. The proposed $5.0 million credit would be made to the Gov-
ernment, which would relend the total amount to TEA. The relending terms, to
be set forth in a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and JEA,
and approved by the Association would provide for repayment in 25 years, in-
cluding a 3-1/2 year grace period, at 8-1/2 percent per annum interest. The
Government has asked the Arab Fund to finance the S12.5 million balance of the
foreign exchange cost of the project, and this request is presently under con-
sideration. Should this financing not be forthcoming the Government will bear
the balance of the foreign exchange cost of the project (Section 3.01(a) of
the Development Credit Agreement).   The local costs of the project would be
financed by internal cash generation and by Government equity contribution.



-9-
Enactment of an Electricity Law and Tariffs
24.       Although the Jordan Electricity Authority Law of 1967 and numerous
contracts and licenses to other power entities form a reasonably comprehensive
basis for regulation of the sector, certain aspects of its Law do not give JEA
sufficient authority to carry out its asslgned functions. Under the first IDA
Credit (386-.JO, 1973), the Government had provided assurances that it would
initiate by September 30, 1974, appropriate legislative action to amend as
necessary the existing laws to: (i) enable JEA to become a more fully auton-
omous power company and be subject only in specific matters of sufficient
general importance to the direction of the Minister of the National Economy,
(ii) define more adequately the basic principles needed to regulate the sec-
tor in such matters as tariffs, easements, inspection and testing, a unified
accounting system, the collection of statistics and the preparation of tech-
nical information; and (iii) formulate regulations or bylaws setting out the
detailed procedures and requirements to achieve the objectives of the Law.
In view of the unexpected difficulties in drafting the proposed legislation,
and in order to incorporate the results of the ongoing tariff study discussed
below, the Association has agreed to a postponement of the date for initiating
legislative action. During negotiations, a new date, December 31, 1975, was
agreed (Section 3.06 (a) of the Development Credit Agreement).
25.       As most of Jordan's future power generation is expected to be
thermal, wholesale and retail tariffs for electricity should include a fuel
price adjustment clause to protect the financial viability of the operating
companies. Under this clause, all increases in the price of residual fuel
oil above a pre-determined base price would automatically be passed onto the
retail distributor and, if appropriate, to the consumers. The Government and
JEA have agreed under Credit 386-JO to incorporate such a fuel price adjust-
ment clause in tariffs by mid-1975 and also to maintain JEA's tariffs at a
level high enough to produce an annual rate of return of at least 9 percent
on its average net fixed assets. Because of the significance of this require-
ment in protecting JEA's financial position, introduction of the fuel price
adjustment clause is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit
(Section 5.01 (c) of the Development Credit Agreement).
26.       Consultants were retained under 386-JO to study JEA's future bulk
sales tariffs and to make recommendations for a modern retail tariff structure
to be implemented throughout the country. Their final report is expected to
be completed before the end of 1975, taking into account the effects of
IDECO's new power station, and of JEA's supplies to JEPCO from the new Hussein
thermal plant and future expansion. During negotiations, the Government and
JEA have agreed: (i) to discuss with IDA the final tariff recommendations;
and (ii) to introduce the new tariffs not later than March 31, 1976 (Section
3.02 of the Development Credit Agreement).
Procurement
27.       All contracts to be financed from the proposed Credit would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding, consistent with



- 10 -
the Bank/IDA Guidelines for Procurement. A preference of 15 percent or the
customs duty level, whichever is less, would be granted to Jordanian manu-
facturers.
Disbursements
28.       Disbursement would be against the c.i.f. costs of equipment and re-
lated services, and the foreign exchange cost of civil works, engineering and
consulting services. The proposed credit would finance 30 percent of the
foreign exchange costs of equipment for the Hussein thermal station, 10 percent
of the cost of the civil works, and 15 percent of the foreign exchange cost
of related consulting services. IDA would also finance 25 percent of the
foreign exchange costs of the Southern Jordan Power Development Study. The
reconditioning of the diesel units at the Marqa station would be financed from
Government or other sources. Works under the project are expected to be
completed by June 30, 1978. The closing date would be December 31, 1979, to
allow for unexpected delays final payment of retention monies.
29.       Retroactive financing estimated not to exceed US$100,000 is proposed
for foreign expenditure required before credit signing for the Southern Jordan
Power Development Study which is expected to be initiated as soon as possible,
and for engineering services.
Justification
30.       Power development in Jordan has been on the basis of diesel genera-
tion since the country has no significant sources of hydropower or other
energy sources that can be developed readily. The only feasible alternative
to continued diesel development is therefore steam-electric capacity. The
Hussein Stage I, an all-steam development, was compared with continued diesel
development up to 100-MW in new capacity followed by steam. It was shown
that, at the highest assumed growth rate, an all-steam development would be
the least cost up to a discount rate of about 15 percent. The internal fi-
nancial rate of return (IFR) is about 15 percent on the basis of existing
tariff. The sensitivity analysis shows that the most likely range of the
TFR is 12 to 18 percent, with a most likely average of 15 percent.
Ecology
31.       The proposed extension of the oil-burning steam plant is located
several kilometers from the township of Zarqa, adjacent to the oil refinery.
The surrounding countryside is largely desert. A 95 percent effective me-
chanical precipitator would be installed and no problems with dust emissions
are expected. Sufficient space would be provided to install additional exhaust
gas cleaning facilities, if necessary, in the future.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUZMENTS AND AUTHORITY
32.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
and the Association, Project Agreement between the Association and TEA, the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of
the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft resolution approving the
proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
33.       Features of the draft Development Credit Agreement and draft Project
Agreement of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 26 through 30 of
this Report. Otherwise, the draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern of
Credits for power projects.
34.       The introduction of the fuel price adjustment clause is a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed credit (Section 5.01(c) of the Development
Credit Agreement).
35.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
36.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

President

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Cr. No. 262 Highway Project; US$6 Million Credit of June 28, 1971:
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This project includes the construction of a highway from Amman to
Zarka and the financing of a study to identify the most suitable means of dis-
tributing traffic from this new road within Amman. Completion of the road
construction works has been delayed by about two years (to about August 1975),
due mainly to management problems of the Contractor. Construction costs have
increased by about 20 percent due to this delay, extra works, and higher
prices. The Closing Date, originally December 31, 1974, has been extended to
December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 285 Education Project; US$5.4 Million Credit of February 11, 1972:
Closing Date: April 30, 1976
The project includes construction and equipment of two comprehen-
sive secondary schools, a polytechnic and trade training center, a teacher's
training college for preparatory and secondary schools, and extension of an
agricultural teacher training college and related technical assistance. All
contracts for civil works were awarded to local firms on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. Contracts were signed in May 1974, and con-
struction started in early June 1974. Bids for about half of the equipment
and all of the furniture were received in May 1974, and contracts have been
awarded. Cost overruns are expected to be about 35 percent for the total
project and will be met by the Government. After initial delays of about
five months, physical implementation is proceeding satisfactorily and is
expected to be completed by April 30, 1976 closing date. However, an ex-
tension of the Closing Date by one year will be required for the completion
of the technical assistance program.
Cr. No. 385 Amman Water Supply and Sewerage Project, US$8.7 Million Credit
of May 24, 1973; Closing Date:December 31, 1977
The project aims at alleviating serious water shortages and insuffi-
ciency of sewerage services in Amman, reducing the high percentage of unac-
counted for water, and developing the administrative structure of the entity
responsible for Amman's water supply and sewerage systems. The project is
progressing satisfactorily, and procurement is on schedule. Financial results
are better than appraisal projections, and progress has been made on improving
the organizational and financial systems. However, unaccounted water losses
are still high at about 50 percent, and a leak detection survey has been ini-
tiated in November 1974. A draft water tariff study has been completed.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 386 Power Project, US$10.2 Million Credit of May 24, 1973:
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The project is the first Bank Group power project in Jordan and would
help the power sector to change over from diesel to steam power generation, add-
ing 78 megawatts to present total generating capacity, and helping meet rapidly
rising demand through 1977. The project will also provide a reliable and cen-
tralized source of power. Progress in executing the project is satisfactory,
although the commissioning of the gas turbine was delayed by about one year
mainly due to civil works difficulties.
Cr. No. 498 Northeast Ghor Irrigation and Rural Development Project; US$7.5
Million Credit of July 25, 1974: Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project is part of an overall development scheme for the East
Bank of the Jordan Valley, other parts of which will be financed by the German
Federal Republic, USAID, and the Kuwait Fund. The project consists of the agri-
cultural development of 7,700 ha net, of which 6,660 ha are already under irri-
gation, and the provision of rural development facilities for domestic water
supply, health, education, roads, and community development for a population of
about 25,000. The project is a year behind schedule and progress in implement-
ing it has been unsatisfactory; the cost of the project has increased by about
40%. The Government has taken steps to speed up the implementation of the
project, and the next supervision mission has been scheduled for July 1975 to
review progress in project execution.
Cr. No. 534 Second Education Project; US$6.0 Million Credit of March 12, 1975:
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is designed to expand vocational and technical education,
to promote quality improvements in secondary education by replacing uneconomic-
ally small rented school buildings and providing schools with adequate work-
shops, and to support integrated rural development projects in the Jordan Val-
ley through a pilot scheme of non-formal basic education. The project would
include construction, furniture and equipment for the following institutions:
a polytechnic at Irbid; a training complex at Aqaba; a Hotel Training School
at Amman; three comprehensive secondary schools; extension of preparatory and
secondary schools (seven pre-vocational workshops, five science laboratories,
four women's craft centers); and a rural development center.

Disbursement
Arrangements:       Disbursements would be against the c.i.f. costs of equip-
ment and related services and the foreign exchange cost
of civil works and for engineering and consulting services.
IDA would finance 30 percent exchange costs of equipment
for the Hussein Thermal Station, 10 percent of the cost
of its civil works, and 15 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of related consulting services. IDA would also fi-
nance 25 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the
Southern Jordan Power Development Study. Retroactive fi-
nancing is proposed for foreign expenditure required
before credit signing for the Southern Jordan Power Dev-
elopment Study which is expected to be initiated as soon
as possible, and engineering services estimated not to
exceed US$100,000.

Procurement
Arrangements:       All contracts to be financed from the proposed Credit
(except for consulting services) would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding, consistent
with the Bank/IDA Guidelines for Procurement. JEA is
exempt from paying import duties. A preference of 15
percent or customs duty applicable to non-exempt importers,
whichever is less, would be granted to Jordanian manu-
facturers.
Project
Administration:      The Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA), a Government
entity, will be responsible for the execution of the
project.
Consultants:        About 14 man-years of consultants' services will be
needed for the design and supervision of the project
and for a power development study for southern Jordan.
