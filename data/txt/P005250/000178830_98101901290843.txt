APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND HUSSEIN THERMAL POWER PROJECT
JORDAN
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the second stage of the Hussein
Thermal Power Project of the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA), the Govern-
ment entity established in 1967 to provide for coordinated development of the
power sector. JEA has requested assistance from the Association for financing
part of the foreign cost of the project, and is continuing its efforts to ob-
tain co-financing for the Project. The Government would provide any remaining
funds required.
ii.       The first stage of the Hussein Thermal Power Station was jointly
financed by the Association (US$10.2 million under Credit 386-JO) and the
Kuwait Fund (US$10.2 million): The Power Station with two 33-MW steam elec-
tric units and one 12-MW gas turbine unit under construction is located at
Zarqa about 42 km northeast of Amman, the capital of Jordan.
iii.      The Project comprises addition of a third 33-MW steam electric unit,
reconditioning of the diesel-electric power'station at Marqa presently owned
and operated by the Jordanian Electric Power Company (JEPCO), a licensee for.
electricity distribution in Amman area and JEA's future principal consumer,
and the Southern Jordan Power Development Study. The Project is estimated to
cost JD 7.1 million (US$22 million equivalent), with a foreign exchange com-
ponent of JD 5.6 million (US$17.3 million). The Association is proposing to
finance about 29% of the foreign component (US$5 million), suppliers credits
would finance the reconditioning of the Marqa station, a possible co-finan-
cier and the Government would finance the balance.  The credit
would be made to the Jordanian Government and relent to JEA on conventional
terms commensurate with Bank (8-1/2%) practices. It has been assumed that
the balance of the foreign cost will be made available to JEA at similar terms
through co-financing and/or Government financing, except funds for consulting
and engineering services, which will be made available as a grant. The local
cost of the project and related works would be covered by a mix of funds from
the Government in the form of equity participation and from JEA's internal
cash generation. Retroactive financing of about US$100,000 is proposed for
foreign exchange required before Credit signing for engineering and consul-
tant services.
iv.       Contracts to be financed from the proposed Credit (except for con-
sulting services) would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding, consistent with Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement.
v.        The Project forms part (11%) of JEA's large (US$192 million) 1974-80
development program which includes: (a) completion of Hussein Thermal Station
Stage I and the 132-kV facilities around Amman (1976/77); (b) the Project
(Hussein II) and some reinforcement of the 132-kV facilities in the Amman area



- ii -
(1977/78); (c) a fourth unit (66-14W) and 24-MW in gas turbine capacity together
with 200 km of 132-kV lines linking Irbid to Amman and El Hasa in the south
to the northern grid (1978/79); and (d) an additional 66-MW unit and further
transmission expansion (1980/81).
vi.       The electricity sector of Jordan is _divided between two major re-
gional concessions (JEPCO, and Irbid District Electricity Company - IDECO)
and many small local entities. Service is unreliable. An important objec-
tive of the earlier Credit was to achieve an economical and reliable service
by encouraging the Government to organize JEA as a truly autonomous Govern-
ment entity responsible for all major generation and overall planning. It
has doubled its staff in one year. Its organization is being designed by a
Management Consultant from the U.K. By 1976 JEA would be competently equipped
to lead the power sector in the country. Initially, JEA will supply power in
bulk mainly to JEPCO. An extension of the bulk supply to IDECO would be made
by 1979.
vii.      As required under Credit 386-JO, a tariff study covering the main
supply areas and financed by the UK was substantially completed in 1974. The
study will be updated before the end of 1975 and a revised tariff structure
will replace the existing tariffs by April 1976.
viit.     JEA's reassessment of the power requirements indicates that the
annual increase in JEPCO's sales would be 17.8% and the overall forecast
growth, including JEA's direct supply to large consumers, for JEA and JEPCO
would average about 23%.
ix.       Power development in Jordan has been on the basis of diesel gen-
eration since the country has no significant sources of hydropower or other
energy sources that can be developed readily. The only feasible alternative
to continued diesel development is therefore steam-electric capacity. For
this reason, the Hussein Stage I, an all-steam development, was compared with
continued diesel development up to 100 MW in new capacity followed by steam.
It was shown that at the highest assumed growth rate, an all-steam development
would be the least cost up to a discount rate of about 15%. Under the present
assumptions for growth and early 1973 prices, the equalizing discount rate
would be about 17%. Sensitivity analysis with capital costs doubled indicates
that the equalizing discount rate would be about 13%, which is considered to
be above the opportunity cost of capital (10-12%) in Jordan.
x.        On the basis of the agreements reached as set forth in Section VII,
the proposed project would constitute a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of
US$5 million equivalent to be relent to JEA by the Government at 8-1/2% in-
terest and repayed over a period of 25 years, including a grace period of
3-1/2 years.



APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND HUSSEIN THERMAL POWER PROJECT
JORDAN
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on behalf of the
Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA), has requested the International Develop-
ment Association (IDA) to assist in financing a Project comprising the second
33-MW stage of the Hussein Thermal Power Project (Hussein II), reconditioning
of the Marqa diesel generating station (owned and operated by the Jordanian
Electric Power Company - JEPCO, of Amman), and a power development study for
southern Jordan. The Project is estimated to cost JD 7.1 million (US$22 mil-
lion), with a foreign exchange component of JD 5.6 million (US$17.3 million),
of which the Association would finance US$5 million (about 29% of the foreign
component). The balance of the foreign component would be financed by sup-
pliers credits (Marqa reconditioning), a Government grant (consulting and
engineering services), and by the Government if JEA does not succeed in
finding a co-financier for the Project. The local currency content would
be financed by internal cash generation and Government resources.
1.02      The first power project, which was financed jointly (50/50) by IDA
Credit 386-JO (1973) and the Kuwait Fund, comprises two 33-MW steam electric
units and one 12-MW gas turbine generator unit at the new Hussein Thermal
Station at Zarqa (near Amman). Although there were some initial delays, the
project is now progressing satisfactorily; the gas turbine is in operation
and the steam unit is expected to be commissioned by mid-1976, nearly on
schedule. Until the Hussein station is completed, supply conditions will
remain difficult and unreliable.
1.03      JEA's 1974-80 program includes (a) completion of Hussein I and the
132-kV facilities around Amman (1976/77); (b) the Project and some reinforce-
ment of the 132-kV facilities in the Amman area (1977/78); (c) the fourth
unit (66 MW) at the Hussein station and 24 MW in gas turbine capacity, to-
gether with 220 km of 132-kV lines linking Irbid to Amman, and El Hasa in
the south to the northern grid (1978/79); and (d) a fifth unit (66-MW) and
further transmission expansion (1980/81).
1.04      The Project has been prepared following a feasibility study by
JEA's consultants, the Kuljian Corporation of USA, and an appraisal mission
in November/December 1974 by Messrs. W.F. Kupper (Engineer), C.P. Ranganathan
(Engineer/Financial Analyst), and A.J.D. Hutchins (Financial Ccnsultant).

-II. THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
A. Power and Energy Resources
2.01      Jordan has few natural energy resources.  There are no coal de-
posits nor any known deposits of oil. The only indigenous energy resources
are (a) a small hydro-power potential of about 5 MW on the Zarqa River, which
is associated with an irrigation program for the Jordan Valley where a dam
is being constructed (the execution of the power component has not yet been
considered pending further study of its justification); and (b) development
of about 50 MW of hydro-power potential on the Yarmuk River in north Jordan,
also associated with Jordan Valley irrigation (para. 2.25). The Government
is expected to engage consultants soon for the final feasibility study of
the latter development.
2.02      Oil is the main source of commercial energy and is imported under
an agreement with the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company (Tapline) for the transit
of oil from Saudi Arabia through Jordati to the Mediterranean. The oil is con-
veyed by pipe from Tapline to the Jordan Refinery, located at Zarqa, in which
the Government has majority shareholding. Presently Jordan's entire power.
requirement is met by diesel stations operating on gas oil and residual oil.
Both are supplied from the refinery in road tankers throughout the country
at a fixed base price of 7.4 JD/t or USJ57.8/106 Btu for residual oil and
17.6 JD/t or US0126.2/106 Btu for gas oil. On contracts for larger supplies
a discount is allowed; for the power company in Amman this amounts to about
5% for residual oil and 6% for gas oil.
B. The Sector
General
2.03      The Jordan River divides the country into two main areas -- the
agriculturally oriented West Bank and the more economically diversified East
Bank. As the West Bank has been under Israeli occupation since June 1967,
this report confines the study area to the East Bank, which comprises some
91,000 kmZ of the country's total land area of 97,000 km2. The population
of the East Bank, now estimated to be 1.82 million, includes about 700,000
people who live in cities and towns of more than 2,000 inhabitants and over
500,000 displaced persons living in refugee camps. Development has been
confined almost entirely to the northern part of the East Bank, apart from
a small area around Aqaba in the south, Jordan's only outlet to the sea.
The government, however, has undertaken various development studies covering
the Jordan Valley and a narrow area between the desert somewhat east of the
Amman-Aqaba railroad, the Dead Sea and Israer.



-3-
2.05      The best agricultural area in the East Bank region is the floor of
the Jordan Valley. East of this valley the terrain rises toward the desert.
The Irbid area in the north produces wheat and other grain crops. Phosphate
rock, quarried from one of the world's richest deposits, is the principal
developed resource of the East Bank region and expected to be the base of
development in the south.
2.06      Before the Arab-Israeli war in June 1967, buoyant growth took place
in all sectors. The war interrupted these favorable trends but the Government
took action to alleviate the difficulties from the war and its aftermath and
growth returned rapidly to the pre-1967 trend. Civil disturbances in the
second half of 1970, however, brought the economy virtually to a standstill
and power service was interrupted in the Amman area for some time. Since
1970 the Government's actions have helped substantially to restore a confi-
dent investment climate. As a consequence, demand for power is increasing
at a rate well above past trends. Pfresent generating capacity is inadequate
to meet these requirements fully and will continue to be so until the first
power project is completed.
2.07      Development in the power sector has been on a local basis by pri-
vate and municipal organizations. Integration is in progress in the northern
part of the country, where JEPCO and the Irbid District Electricity Company
(IDECO) are rapidly expanding their networkd in the respective concession
areas. JEA would meet all of JEPCO's requirements with the commissioning
of the first stage of the Hussein power station. The expected interconnec-
tion of the JEA and IDECO system by 1978/1979 would further centralize gen-
eration. From 1976 onward JEPCO and IDECO will supply the future network
in the Jordan Valley, which is being constructed by the Jordan Valley Au-
thority. The IDA power projects will advance the integration trend.
2.08      JEA was established by law (No. 21) in 1967 to provide for a coor-
dinated development of the power sector and the country's power resources.
The law vests in it the authority to designate existing power stations to
operate under its direction as "selected power stations", acquire such power
stations, and cause uneconomic stations to cease operation (see 4.01).
2.09      JEA has not yet operated as an electricity supply undertaking;
presently it channels Government loans for power development to JEPCO and
IDECO, and supervises the expansion of generation facilities and the 33-kV
distribution networks in the Amman and Irbid areas, the Jordan Valley and
other major towns in the country.
Organization
2.10      The sector is under the direction of the Ministry of Economy.  A
draft electricity law (parallel to the JEA law) was prepared in 1967 but never
instituted. Although it comprises all basic elements for regulating the sec-
tor, the Government wished to review the draft to reflect present conditions.
Under Credit 386-JO, the Government undertook: (i) to initiate legislative
action by September 30, 1974, for the enactment of a law adequately defining



- 4 -
inter alia the principles and basic requirements for generation, transmission,
and distribution of power (including licenses), tariffs, easements, inspection
and testing, a unified accounting system, the collection of statistics and
the preparation of technical information; and (ii) to formulate regulations
or by-laws necessary to achieve the objectives of the law, including delega-
tion to JEA of regulatory functions of a technical nature. Since JEA will
now start commence full operation as a utility in mid-1976, and to permit
incorporating the results of the ongoing tariff study (see 2.20), the Asso-
ciation has agreed to postponing the date for initiating legislative action.
Through JEA's management consultants, an expert from the UK's Central Elec-
tricity Board has been engaged who has submitted his preliminary proposals
concerning the legislation. During negotiations the Government agreed to
present its proposals to the legislature not later than December 31, 1975.
Facilities
2.11      Annex 1 gives data on power installations in the country.  Except
in Amman, most of the plants are small, catering to small communities and
to private industries. The generating facilities are in most cases derated
due to cooling problems and are badly maintained. Total installed capacity
is of the order of 125 MW, including about 40 MW in captive plant (auto pro-
ducers.) The rated distribution voltage is 220/380 V, three-phase four-wire,
at 50 Hz.
2.12      The number of consumers served by JEPCO and IDECO as of September
1974 was about 113,300, of whom 86,400 or 76% were supplied by JEPCO and
26,900 or 24% by IDECO (Annexes 3 through 6). JEPCO supplies the area with
the greatest growth potential, including the capital city of Amman and the
Zarqa industrial area. The area supplied by IDECO is mainly agricultural.
2.13      In south Jordan, electricity supply is provided by isolated under-
takings, the largest public one being the Aqaba Port Authority which supplies
a peak demand of about 3 MW. The Jordan Phosphate Company, which has a load
of 5 MW, generates its own requirements near its mine at Al Hasa.
2.14      The largest captive plants are those of the Jordan Cement Company
(14 MW), which is about 20 km south-west of Amman, and the refinery at Zarqa
(4.8 MW). There are a number of small private plants, some of which are used
for emergency standby only. In the Jordan Valley there are thought to be
about 200 small pumping stations, mostly operated by small individual diesel
sets, aggregating at least 1,500 kW.
Jordanian Electric Power Company
2.15      JEPCO, a private company, operates the following three diesel sta-
tions in the Amman area (Annex 7):
(a) the base loaded Marqa station near Amman with 11 units, ori-
ginally aggregating about 54 MW now derated to 38 MW;



(b) the Abdali station at Zarqa with 4 units, originally aggre-
gating 4.8 MW now derated to 4 MW; and
(c) the Ras-al-Ain station in Amman, the oldest of the three
stations, with 10 units, derated from 7.3 MW to 4 MW.
The Abdali and Ras-al-Ain power stations would be retired when the first stage
of the Hussein power station is commissioned. At that time the Marqa station
will either be acquired by JEA or be operated by JEPCO on JEA's behalf as a
"selected" power station (see 5.06).
2.16      Transmission and distribution follows the European pattern:  power
is transmitted at 33 kV and subtransmitted at 6.6 kV, except in Zarqa, where
the intermediate voltage is 10 kV. JEPCO's supply network comprises about
110 km of 33-kV lines and cables and about 150 km of 10-kV and 6.6-kV lines
and cables.
Irbid District Electricity Company
2.17      IDECO, the other major private company, operates a diesel station
in Irbid and some small diesel stations totalling some 670 kW (derated to
500 kW) in townships that are connected to the 33-kV network. It also op-
erates one small isolated undertaking (North Shunah) in the Jordan Valley
and a second at El-Mashari. The Irbid power station has a total capacity
of 5.5 MW, derated to 4.2 MW. IDECO is expected to be connected to JEA
system by 1978/79.
2.18      IDECO transmits power at 33 kV and 6.6 kV, operating some 150 km of
33-kV lines and 42 km of 6.6-kV lines and underground cables.
Statistical Data of JEPCO and IDECO
2.19      The following summarizes the 1970-73 statistics for JEPCO's and
IDECO's electricity generation and supply as shown inter alia in Annexes 3
and 4 (JEPCO), and 5 and 6 (IDECO).
------ JEPCO---------  --------IDECO---------
1970  1971  1972  1973  1970  1971  1972  1973
Installed capacity (MW)    47    47    47    60   3.3   4.7   4.7   4.9
Firm capacity (MW)          32    32    36    40   3.3  .4.7   4.7   4.9

Growth in sales (%)         -1    12    19    14      3    28    30    14
Both in Amman and Irbid, demand is suppressed due to lack of capacity and
regular programs of supply cuts, particularly during the peak hours, are in
force.



-6-
Tariffs
2.20      A tariff study covering the main supply areas (Amman, Irbid and
Kerak), financed by the UK and executed by the North Eastern Electricity
Board (NEEB), was substantially completed in 1974 under terms of reference
acceptable to the Association. The preliminary recommendations for tariff
levels (see Annex 8) are based on 1973 accounts and reflect a 9% financial
rate of return target. NEEB experts will visit Jordan in September 1975 for
final updating and completion of the study before the end of the year. The
final recommendations will reflect (a) the analysis of marginal cost of gen-
erating, transmitting and distributing electricity over the next few years,
(b) a proposal for JEA's bulk sales tariffs, (c) a proposed system for setting
up a system for monitoring price levels within the recommended structures to
ensure that financial viability is maintained, and (d) a proposal for a fuel
price adjustment clause.
2.21      Because all of Jordan's generation is thermal, the Government under-
took, in connection with Credit 386-JO, to include by June 30, 1975, a provi-
sion for a fuel price adjustment clause in JEA's tariffs. No action has yet
been taken and, because of the significance of this requirement in protecting
JEA's financial position, introduction of the fuel price adjustment clause
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit.
2.22      In view of the major improvement and changes in generating facilities
expected in the three main areas of supply in 1975/76, the introduction of a
new tariff structure at the time as enactment of the electricity law appears
appropriate. During negotiations, the Government and JEA agreed: (a) to dis-
cuss with IDA the final tariff recommendations; and (b) to introduce the new
tariffs not later than March 31, 1976, and (c) to further review the tariffs
not later than June 30, 1977, for implementation of the necessary changes,
if any, by September 30, 1977.
C. The Development Program
2.23      In the northern sector the development program is well defined.
IDECO would complete the construction of a new power station with an installed
capacity of about 9 MW by about mid 1975 and continue to expand its 33-kV net-
works including the connection to the Jordan Valley in the north. JEA would
complete its 132-kV transmission system, financed with UK development funds,
linking Zarqa with the Amman ring, and JEPCO would further expand its 30-kV
system including the connection to the Jordan Valley in the south. Demand
is expected to exceed JEPCO's firm capacity in 1975 despite commissioning
of a third 6-MW diesel unit in the Marqa station, and JEA would meet JEPCO's
peaking requirements for 1975/76 with the gas turbine financed under Credit
386-JO. By mid-1976 JEA would meet all of JEPCO's requirements from the
Hussein Thermal Station. In order to continue to meet this commitment the
third 33-MW unit at this station, which would be partly financed by the pro-
posed credit, should be completed in 1978. However, except for 1976, the



-7-
reserve position would be tight throughout the period in view of the unrelia-
bility of the older Marqa diesel, and the time required for reconditioning of
these units. Depending on actual load growth the Government may yet decide
to advance procurement of a gas turbine unit now scheduled for 1978/79, to
ensure reliable supply. JEA's 1974-1980 development program, together with
its cost is shown in Annex 9. It amounts to JD 62 million (US$192 million),
of which the first power prcject constitutes about 12% and the second project
about 11%.
2.24      A summary of the Government's 3-year Rehabilitation and Development
Plan for the Jordan Valley is included in Annex 2. The power would be supplied
from IDECO's system in the north and from JEPCO's system in the south. The
estimated load would increase from 6.5 MW in 1975/76 to 16 MW by 1980/81. In
view of the delays in implementing the plan it appears likely that initial
demand and load growth will be lower than anticipated.
2.25      The Government intends to conduct a final study of the multipurpose
project on the Yarmuk river on the border with Syria. A feasibility study
was completed in the mid-sixties but further progress was impcssible in the
aftermath of the 1967 war. Because the countries are also studying the pos-
sibility of interconnecting their respective power systems, which could have
a major effect on Jordan's requirements for transmission lines (including the
Yarmuk plant connecting line), the developments are in too early a stage to
be included in the development program. In any event, the hydro station
would not be completed before the end of this decade.
2.26      Rapid developments are expected in the south-western part of the
country, comprising:
(a) expansion of the El Hasa phosphate Mines requiring about
10 MW in additional capacity in 1978 and a further 20 MW
in 1980;
(b) construction of a potash plant (17 MW) at the southern end
of the Dead Sea;
(c) opening of a copper mine east of Shan (5 MW);
(d) construction of a fertilizer plant (10 MW), a cement plant
(20 MW) and a glass factory (0.6 MW) in the area of Ma'an;
(e) development of tourist facilities throughout the area, in-
cluding Aqaba, requiring about 1 MW; and
(f) improvement of present power facilities in towns and a small
rural development plan in the Karak area.



- 8 -
2.27      In view of the relatively large industrial requirements which are
expected to considerably improve Jordan's exports and foreign currency earn-
ings, JEA has requested IDA to finance from the proposed credit a long-term
power development study for southern Jordan (including alternative supply
either from a power station in the south or from the northern system), and
has invited proposals from consultants on the basis of terms of reference
shown in Annex 10, for appointment before July 31, 1975. The study, which
would be completed within 12 months, would require 42 expert man-months.
JEA will discuss with IDA the recommendations resulting from the study and
the actions it expects to take.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      Together with the first IDA project, the Project would as its main
objective seek to prepare JEA for being an efficient public bulk supply
utility, providing economic and reliable service, and removing capacity
shortages.
B. Description
3.02      The Project is described in detail in Annex 11.  It consists of:
(a) a third 33-MW steam-electric unit to be installed at the
Hussein power station at Zarqa;
(b) reconditioning of the 38-MW diesel-electric power station
at Marqa presently owned by JEPCO; and
(c) the Southern Jordan Power Development Study.
3.03      The third 33-MW unit would be similar to the first two units at the
Hussein station. Most of the common facilities have been included in the
supply for the first stage. The selection of the site for Hussein Stage I
was based on the availability of water and proximity of .the fuel supply. The
ultimate capacity of the station will be largely determined by the availabil-
ity of water but, since a closed cooling system will be used, total proved
production at the selected site is adequate to sustain a steam power station
of several hundred MW.
3.04      The Project also includes reconditioning of diesel units at JEPCO's
station at Marqa, and adding radiator cooling to them. By 1977 JEA would
acquire the diesel generating station at Marqa, presently owned by JEPCO, or
have JEPCO operate the station as a selected station (reserved to meet the
requirements of JEA) on a cost reimbursable basis (see 5.06).

C. Status of Engineering
3.05      Kuljian of USA has been engaged, with the concurrence of the Asso-
ciation, for the feasibility study of this Project and all aspects of bidding
and supervision of both the first and second Projects. The bidding documents
for the second stage are to be issued in June 1975. Engineering costs for
the first stage are being financed jointly with the Kuwait Fund under Credit
386-JO. Those for the second stage would be financed by the proposed credit
and a Government grant.
D. Cost Estimate
3.06      The estimated cost of the Project excluding interest during con-
struction is US$22 million equivalent, of which US$17.3 million would be
in foreign exchange, based on the appropriate effective parity rate at the
time of appraisal of JD 1 = US$3.1. Annex 12 shows the estimated cost of
the project, which is summarized as follows:
X of
---   TJD '000-------- _------US$'000------- Project

Base Cost Estimate    967.1  4,419.4 5,387.0   3,000  13,700  16,700
Contingencies:

Total           1,529.0  5,577.4 7,106.4   4,740  17,290  22,030    100
3.07      The estimate is based on the results of late 1974 bids received by
the consultants for similar units to which a price contingency of about US$4
million (Local cost;  15% for 1975 and 12% for subsequent yearn; Foreign
cost: 11% for 1975 and 7.5% for subsequent years) was added to allow for
expected future cost increases.
3.08      On the basis of the above estimate, the third unit would cost
about US$600/kW or about double the cost per kW of the first stage which was
contracted in July 1972. Overall cost of the Hussein power station, however,
would not be unreasonable at about US$37 million, or US$370/kW.



- 10 -
E. Financing
3.09      The proposed IDA credit would finance about 29% of the foreign ex-
change cost of the Project, and suppliers credits (Marqa) and a Government
grant (engineering and studies) about 6% each. The balance of the foreign
cost (49%) would be financed by the Government to the extent JEA does not
succeed in finding co-financing for the Project. Local costs would be fi-
nanced by internally generated funds and by Government contributions.
F. Implementation
3.10      Construction of the third unit at the Hussein Station is expected
to commence early in 1977, for operation by mid-1978.
3.11      This report assumes that JEA would acquire the Marqa diesel station
from JEPCO in January 1977 (see 5.06). Reconditioning of the older Marqa
diesel sets would be executed by JEPCO on behalf of and under the guidance
and supervision of JEA.
G. Procurement
3.12      All contracts to be financed from the proposed Credit (except for
consulting services) would be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding, consistent with the Bank/IDA Guidelines for Procurement. JEA
is exempt from paying import duties. Although little participation is ex-
pected, a preference of 15% or actual customs duty, whichever is less, would
be granted to Jordanian manufacturers. It is assumed that the procedures
will also be acceptable to a possible co-financer.
H. Disbursements
3.13      Disbursement would be against the c.i.f. costs of equipment and
related services, and the foreign exchange cost of civil works, engineering
and consulting services. The estimated disbursement schedules for the Credit
are shown in Annex 13. The proposed credit would finance 30% of the foreign
exchange costs of equipment for the Hussein thermal station and related serv-
ices, 15% of the foreign cost of engineering services, and 25% of the foreign
cost of the Southern Jordan Power Development Study. In the event a co-fi-
nancer is identified, the Association would be prepared to adjust these per-
centages to accommodate the available financing. Should the foreign exchange
cost to complete the Project be less than estimated, any undisbursed amount
of the proposed credit would be reallocated to allow full disbursement of the
Credit or, in the event co-financing is obtained for the balance of the re-
quired foreign cost, to consulting services for the next stage of development
or, if not required for that purpose, the undisbursed amount would be cancelled.



- 11 -
The closing date would be December 31, 1979, to allow for final payment of
retention moneys.
3.14      Retroactive financing is proposed for foreign expenditure required
before credit signing for the Southern Jordan Power Development Study which
is expected to be initiated as soon as possible, and for engineering services;
the total is- estimated not to exceed US$100,000.
I. Environment Impact
3.15      The proposed oil-burning plant would be located several kilometers
from the township of Zarqa, adjacent to the oil refinery. The surrounding
countryside is largely desert. A 95% effective mechanical precipitator
would be installed and no problems iith dust emissions or ash disposal are
expected. Sufficient space would be provided to install additional exhaust
gas cleaning facilities, if necessary in the future. The cooling system is
of the air-cooled, closed radiator type.
IV. THE PROJECT ENTITY
A. Background
4.01      JEA was established in 1967 with the enactment of the Jordan Elec-
tricity Authority Law No. 21. The objectives of the law are: (a) to estab-
lish generation and transmission facilities to supply energy in bulk to other
undertakings whose systems are connected to the JEA systems; (b) to manage
and operate any undertaking transferred to or acquired by JEA and (c) to
develop a supply of electricity in areas where there is an economic demand
and which are not within the concession area of supply of other undertakings.
Existing power stations may be designated by JEA as "selected power stations"
and will then operate under JEA's direction. Subject to Cabinet approval
these "selected power stations" may either be purchased by agreement with
the owners or the energy produced may be bought by JEA at a cost sufficient
to cover the owner's related operating costs. Electricity undertakings in
Jordan can be purchased by JEA in agreement with the owners, subject to the
Cabinet's consent. JEA may also require that power stations connected to
the system but not designated as "selected power stations" and not consid-
ered to be economically justified for continued generation, cease operation.
4.02      The non-current assets of JEA are at present:  (a) a plant to manu-
facture poles financed by a U.K. credit and constructed in 1967; (b) its con-
struction loans to IDECO and JEPCO (see Annex 22) and (c) work in progress
under Credit 386-JO -and the Kuwait Fund loan for the Hussein station and a
UK loan for the 132-kV transmission system around Amman. JEA is not yet an
operating utility in the conventional sense.



- 12 -
B. Organization and Management
Organization
4.03      An Implementation Committee managed JEA from 1967 to 1972 until
its first Board of Directors was appointed in accordance with Law No. 21,
with the Minister of National Economy as Chairman, a Vice-Chairman, and
six other members who presently include the President of the Amman Chamber
of Commerce, and the General Managers of JEA and JEPCO. Under Credit 386-JO,
management consultants (Peat, Marwick and Mitchell, who initiated their work
in September 1974) are advising on the appropriate organization for JEA, a
satisfactory preliminary outline for which was presented to the Association.
Staffing
,.o4     With the agreement of the Association as required under Credit
386-JO with respect to the recruiting scheme and remuneration schedules, JEA
had about doubled its staff, to 135. Of these, 34 are technicians of the pole
manufacturing plant; 25 engineers, 19 technicians, 3 accountants, 1 statisti-
cian, 2 draftsmen, 10 foremen and 41 clerical staff make up the remainder.
An experienced chief mechanical engineer has been engaged for the Zarqa plant
and technical staff is either following training courses (see 4.05) or in-
volved in the various aspects of construction of the Zarqa plant. Similarly,
clerical staff is being given on-the-job training with the help of the man-
agement consultants. Total number of staff is expected to be 290 by mid-1976,
when the Hussein power statign is expected to commence operations.
Training
4.05      JEA's training activities are satisfactory.  A U.K. expert of the
NEEB recently completed a draft study of JEA's training requirements, the
proposals of which are presently being discussed for implementation. In view
of the urgency, however, the following actions or decisions have been taken
with the assistance of the U.K. Overseas Development Association (ODA):
-    4 transmission and distribution engineers and 1 mechanical
engineer are being trained in England;
-    Several mechanical engineers will be trained in the U.K. in
1975;
-    9 administrative staff are expected to follow, in 1975, a
4-month training course in the U.K. with ODA assistance.
Additionally:
-    6 mechanical engineers and 6 technicians will be trained in
1975 at Syrian generating stations;



- 13 -
A similar arrangement is under discussion for training in
Iraq;
-    1 administrator is following a 9-month local course in
statistics.
4.06      JEA has contracted with its consultants to provide experienced ex-
patriate supervisory staff for the first 12 months of operation after the
Hussein station is commissioned. No substantial difficulties are expected in
recruiting operational skilled labor and junior staff, since JEPCO's Ras-Al-
Ain and Zarqa diesel stations will be closed down, making available redundant
staff.
C. Operations
4.07      JEA's operations will start shortly, with the commissioning of the
gas turbine financed by Credit 386-JO at the Zarqa power station site.
Forecasts
4.08      JEA, assisted by its consultants, has reassessed power requirements
and the resulting balances of energy and capacities for JEPCO and JEA are
shown in Annex 14 (which are presented for both companies, in view of the
fact that JEPCO is expected to be JEA's principal consumer for many years).
The changes from the previous appraisal are considerable because several
large additional consumers are to be connected. The principal ones are:
(i) the existing cement factory to be connected in 1977 (supply would be
about 72 GWh by 1978, assuming that only the additional requirements of
12 MW due to the expansion would have to be met); and (ii) the existing
refinery at Zarqa (2.4 MW about 12 GWh annually, similarly assuming that
only the additional requirements would have to be met). The average annual
increase in JEPCO sales would be 17.8% (see Annex 16), but overall forecast
growth -- i.e., including JEA's direct supply to large consumers (and to
Irbid by 1979) -- for the two companies would average about 23%.
4.09      Annex 15 provides information on the details of JEA's forecast
sales to its 4 future customers: JEPCO, the Refinery, the Cement Factory,
and Irbid. General information with respect to JEPCO's forecast operations
are shown in Annex 3, and details of sales in Annex 4. Summarizing for the
Amman area (i.e. aggregating the JEA and JEPCO data and excluding Irbid), the
following table shows historic and forecast growth in sales for the various
consumer categories, total generation and capacities:

The above table shows that principal growth would be in industry while other
categories would increase in accordance with past growth rates. Nevertheless
industry would, by 1980, still constitute only 45% of total sales (a lower
proportion than in 1963). In part this is due to the continued operation of
captive plant, although, looking further ahead, this is expected to be re-
placed largely by public supply.
V. FINANCE
A. Past Performance and Present Position
5.01      JEA's only activities at present are the production of concrete
poles, the supervision of projects financed by UK loans, relent by JEA to
IDECO and JEPCO, and the supervision of Hussein I construction. In the past
the pole plant production has been sold at cost since-most customers were
public agencies; however, in future it is assumed that prices would be ad-
justed to yield a 9% rate of return on the pole-plant assets.



- 15 -
5.02      JEA's income statements, balance sheets and fund statements cover-
ing the years 1971 through 1973 are shown in Annexes 19, 20 and 21. JEA's
net fixed assets as at December 31, 1973 mainly comprised the value of the
pole plant and work in progress relative to the first stage of Hussein Thermal
Power Project. Long term investments were the U.K. loans relent to JEPCO and
to IDECO. About three quarters of JEA's long-term debt was in respect of loans
relent to JEPCO and IDECO and the balance was in respect of loans/credits for
Hussein I and 132-kV transmission lines projects.
5.03      The U.K. loans to the Government, which are interest-free, are re-
lent to JEA on the same terms and again relent by JEA to IDECO and JEPCO on
more exacting terms including interest at 4%-6%. The loans are for the con-
struction of IDECO's generation and transmission development schemes and for
JEPCO's expansion of generation. Relending profits are transferred to JEA's
capital reserve in compliance with its agreement with the Government. Annex
17 gives the details of the lending and relending terms of all such loans.
5.04      The debt equity ratio at December 31, 1973 is shown as 80:20.  This
is distorted however, by the inclusion of loans relent to JEPCO and IDECO.
If borrowings for relending are excluded, the ratio would be 42:58.
B. Tariffs
5.05      JEA's average sales price has been assumed to be 9.9 fils/kWh
(US13.1/kWh) for 1976, 10.1 fils/kWh (US43.1/kWh) for 1977, 12 fils/kWh
(US43.7/kWh) for 1978 and 13.4 fils/kWh (US44.2/kWh) for 1979 and 16.2 fils/
kWh (USd5.0/kWh) for 1980, ensuring a 9% rate of return as covenanted under
Credit 386-JO and a cash generation to cover 1.5 times its debt service re-
quirements. The final recommendations of the tariff study (see 2.20) are
expected to result in tariff levels near these averages.
C. Future Operating Results
5.06      Although JEA is expected to sell a small quantity of energy from
the gas turbine in 1975, JEA's operations as a utility company will not
really start until 1976 with the coming into service of the steam generat-
ing units. During the forecast period through 1980, JEA's principal customer
will be JEPCO (IDECO is expected to be connected to the JEA system in 1978-
79), and from 1977 JEA will require JEPCO's Marqa diesel station to generate
power for standby or for peaking purposes in order to ensure the most economic
overall generation for the system. In connection with Credit 386-JO, Govern-
ment agreed with JEPCO that it would designate Marqa as a "selected station",
and that by June 30, 1975, JEA would negotiate a contract with JEPCO covering
the operation of Marqa. The general provisions of the proposed contract were
agreed with the Association. However, the Government and JEA are now review-
ing the matter further, but during negotiations have given assurances that



- 16 -
they will take a final decision on this before March 31, 1976. If they decide
to operate Marqa as a "selected station" a contract acceptable to the Associa-
tion would be executed between JEA and JEPCO before June 30, 1976. If they
decide to acquire Marqa all necessary legal action would be completed by
June 30, 1976 and the assets transferred by December 31, 1976. This report
assumes that JEA will acquire Marqa in January 1977 on an equitable indemnif-
ication of JEPCO against loss of its earning power.
Rate Covenant
5.07      Assuming the above average selling prices to JEPCO and direct con-
sumers (see 5.05), JEA is expected to achieve an annual rate of return in the
order of 9% from 1976 onward (see Annex 19). The Government and JEA have
agreed that JEA's tariffs will be maintained at a level high enough to pro-
duce an annual rate of return of at least 9% on average net fixed assets in
operation, appropriately valued and revalued from time to time.
JEA's Financing Plan
5.08      The financial forecasts cover the period through 1980 in order to
include the results of a few years' operation. The buildup of JEA's fixed
assets will be financed by borrowing, except for the local costs of the Proj-
ect with its associated transmission line which will be financed by JEA's
internal cash generation and the Government's contribution to equity. In
addition to the Project, which will be financed 29% by IDA and the remaining
71% by the Government (or a suitable co-financier, if one can be found), the
associated Stage II of the 132-kV Zarqa/Amman line and connection to the
cement factory will also be financed entirely by JEA and the Government.
Local currency requirements of the latter expansion will be financed by
Government grants and by JEA from internal cash generation. The Credit
would be onlent to JEA under a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to
the Association which would provide for terms of not less than 8-1/2% for
25 years with a 3-1/2-year grace period.
5.09      JEA's financial forecasts indicate that its electricity and pole-
plant operations would start contributing to its internal cash generation
from 1976 onwards, rising from JD 835,000 (US$2.6 million) in 1976 to
JD 7,409,000 (US$23.0 million) in 1980. Its total 1974-1980 internal cash
generation, including its surpluses from "banking" and pole manufacturing
operations, would be JD 23,727,000 (US$73.6 million).
5.10      The report assumes that the Government grants comprising a portion
of the local expenditures mentioned above for the Project and the second
stage of the 132-kV transmission line and other miscellaneous additional
expenditures, including the financing of the cement factory connection and
the purchase price of Marqa, will be treated as Government equity. In view
of the ambitious expansion program and the tight forecast cash position,
assurances included in the 386-JO Guarantee Agreement would be repeated for
the proposed Credit that no return on Government's equity will be declared or
paid before 1980 unless in the opinion of the Association such a distribution



- 17 -
would not be prejudicial to JEA's requirements for its capital expansion.
The Government's agreement to this was obtained. Assurances have also been
obtained from the Government that it will make arrangements satisfactory to
the Association for providing funds for carrying out the Project and the
related Zarqa-Amman transmission line if the funds available to JEA should
be inadequate to meet such expenditures. In summary, JEA's financing plan
for 1974 through 1978 (the Project period), which is realistic, is as follows:

- 18 -
5.11      As is shown, JEA's internal cash generation and its income from
relending operations would be sufficient to meet the local fund requirements
for the Project. However, a mix of internal cash generation and the Govern-
ment's equity contribution would be used for financing the local cost of this
and other projects.
Financial Position-Forecast
5.12      Forecast financial statements for JEA for the period 1974 to 1980
are shown in Annexes 19 through 21.  These reflect the start up and expansion
of JEA as a major wholesale electricity supply organization.  The statements
have been prepared including appropriate adjustments for price escalation in
operating expenses and developme*it program costs and periodic revaluation of-
assets.  Annex 25 sinarizes these statements (Case A) for comparison with
a forecast at constant (1974) prices (Case B). This comparison shows that
tariff increases aggregating about 65% would be required over the period to
offset assumed inflationary trends (see 5.05, 5.07). Without price escala-
tion, increases of 15% would be adequate.
5.13      JEA's debt/equity ratio would be 76/24 in 1976, reflecting the high
level of borrowings for initial operations, but improves to 60/40 by 1980, a
satisfactory level. Debt service coverage would be adequate over the period
(1.5-2.7), but in order to assure that the Association would be informed if
future incurrence of debt would jeopardize this position, the debt service
covenant negotiated in connection with Credit 386-JO was extended to this
Credit. This covenant requires that JEA seek the consent of the Association
to incur debt if JEA's net cash earnings before depreciation and interest
would be less than 1.5 times its debt service in any future year, including
service on the amount to be borrowed.
D. Accounts and Audit
Accounting
5.14      JEA's accounting staff comprises a chief accountant and two junior
accountants. This was adequate before the construction financed by Credit
386-JO was started but, with its present construction program and for its
actual operation as a utility company it will not only need additional ac-
counting staff but also, all the staff (including the present employees)
will require training. The management consultants employed under the
earlier credit have designed an appropriate accounting system and will
provide on-the-job training to the accounting staff. JEA will arrange
to send at least one senior accountant abroad for a period of training with
an appropriate utility organization. The foreign exchange cost of this has
already been provided for in the earlier credit.



- 19 -
Auditing
5.15      In accordance with Section 44 of the Jordan Electricity Authority
Law, the books and accounts are audited annually by auditors appointed by
the Minister. In the past the Minister has appointed the local auditing
firm of Shair, Aweida, Shatara and Ayed. These auditing arrangements are
satisfactory and independent auditors acceptable to the Association should
continue to be appointed.
E. Insurance
5.16      Insurance coverage is provided through private local insurance com-
panies operating under Government regulations; in addition, the Government
guarantees legitimate claims against these companies. JEA's purchases from
abroad are usually covered by insurance provided by the supplier.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Forecast of Sales an'd Demand
6.01      Forecasting industrial power requirements is difficult.  JEA in con
junction with JEPCO and the Ministries have recently initiated a census and
survey of all industrial plants under construction and planned. So far they
have identified some 80 plants. It is not expected, however, that the full
census, providing comprehensive data and forecast demand (taking into account
possible construction delays, actual production pattern, etc.) can be com-
pleted before the end of 1975. For this reason a clear distinction was made
between non-industrial and industrial consumptioin.
6.02      For non-industrial consumers, historic trends (least squares method)
have been used in forecasting power requirements, except for "social supply"
(mosques, churches, hospitals, schools, etc., which have a 25% discount on
the normal tariff) and street lighting. Growth in social supply has been ex-
tremely high (30.9%/a) and it was assumed that the future growth rate would
be about half the historic trend due to increased attention to the criteria
for eligibility for this special tariff. Similarly, street lighting, which
has shown a trend of 18.2%/a, was assumed to grow at a rate of 14%/a (see
Annex 16).
6.03      In forecasting industrial consumption a distinction was made be
tween (i) general future consumers (some 70 smaller plants with connected
loads of less than 500 kW) for which the available information ranged from
fair to poor, and (ii) large consumers (11) which either are awaiting author-
ization to increase their demand (including operation during the peak hours)
or have construction schedules for which significant delays are unlikely.



- 20 -
6.04      For the general industrial consumers the consultants indicated a
growth rate of 18% over 1973 (suppressed). The assumption appears reasonable
because (a) the addition of a total of some 25 smaller plant (of the 70 plants
mentioned above) for which the information was reasonably fair, aggregating
some 6.5 MW in capacity, would account for a growth rate of some 10-12% over
and above the historic trend through 1977; and (b) the average 1973-1980 growth
rate for the aggregate supply to non-industrial consumers and the general in-
dustrial consumers would be about 15% (assuming that 3% of energy requirements
was not met in 1973 due to lack of capacity) which compares favorably with the
historic trend of 12.7%.
6.05      Major growth is caused by the connection of large consumers (see
Annex 16), several of which, like the steel mills, the refinery, a ceramic
factory, and a new MIedical City are awaiting power supply authorization de-
pending on the commissioning of JEA's gas turbine plant. These connections
would aggregate 24 MW in 1976 and 36 MW in 1977. Energy supply would grow
from 18 GWh in 1975 to 132 GWh by 1978. The major supply would be by JEPCO,
JEA supplying directly to the cement factory (12 MW expansion), the refinery
at Zarqa (upon commissioning of the gas turbine plant) and Irbid (1978-1979).
Since the difficulties of estimating coincident demand and hours of operation
of various plant may cause overestimation, it was deemed prudent not to include
in the forecast either the supply to the Jordan Valley Development (6.5 MW
initially, depending on work progress), or to assume specific replacement of
captive plant generation by public supply. A summary of the forecast for the
Amman area for 1980 in comparison with actual figures for 1963 and 1973 is
given in para. 4.09.
A
B. Comparison of Alternatives
6.06      During appraisal of the first power project mixed diesel/steam de-
velopments were compared with all steam developments assuming different unit
sizes and different assumptions for growth rates. It was shown that at the
high growth rate an all-steam development would be the least-cost up to a
discount rate of about 15%. Under the present assumptions for growth, and
early 1973 prices, the equalizing discount rate would be about 17%. Sen-
sitivity considerations indicate that doubling of capital cost (which ap-
pears to be the upper limit of 1974 prices compared with 1973 prices) would
cause the equalizing discount rate to decrease to about 13%, which is above
the opportunity cost of capital in Jordan, assumed to range from 10-12%.
Sensitivity to a rise in fuel costs is small. Tripling of the present fuel
price (JD 6.5/t), i.e. assuming a price of about US$10/bbl, would cause the
equalizing discount rate to decrease to about 14.5% under the present assump-
tions for growth. Thus, the 1972 Government decision to convert to steam
plant generation is reaffirmed and JEA's least cost development program should
comprise three 33-MW units (of which the Project constitutes the third unit)
at the Zarqa station, followed by 66-MW units. It appears necessary, depending
on actual load growth, that by mid-1976 JEA should investigate the economic
justification of installing additional gas turbines before the fourth unit
(66 MW) is commissioned at Zarqa.



- 21 -
C. Economic Return of Project
6.07      The internal economic rate of return (IER) of the Project is the
discount rate which equates the present values of the time streams of the
attributable costs and benefits over the Project's assumed life of 25 years.
In the case of this Project, financial costs and benefits have been used in
the analysis since no shadow pricing of inputs or adjustment for taxes was
considered appropriate. The IER is therefore expressed as an internal fi-
nancial rate of return (IFR). The costs are the capital cost of the third
unit at the Hussein power station, the reconditioning of the older diesels
at JEPCO's Marqa station, Stage 2 of the 132-kV transmission system, a por-
tion of the 30-kV regular expansion, assumed at 200 km, a share in the cost
of distribution expansion, assumed at 2 years, plus the cost of operating
the additional facilities. Willingness to pay, measured mainly through the
revenues, has been used as a first approximation of the attributable bene-
fits. These revenues understate the benefits consumers receive from the
Project because it is considered that a tariff increase of reasonable mag-
nitude (say 20%) would not reduce demand significantly. This is further il-
lustrated by the fact that large capacities in costly captive plant have been
installed (and would continue to be installed were the Project not executed)
to meet the electricity needs.
6.08      The IFR is about 15% on the basis of the present retail tariffs.
Sensitivity considerations indicate the following changes in the IFR for
variations of the basic perameters.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01      The Government has agreed with the Association on December 31, 1975
as the date for initiating legislation of a General Electricity Law (2.10).
7.02      The Government and JEA have agreed to consult with the Association
before implementing the NEEB's recommendations on Jordan's tariff structure
revision and to introduce the new tariffs not later than March 31, 1976.
The tariffs will be further reviewed not later than June 30, 1977 for im-
plementation of the necessary changes, if any, by September 30, 1977,(2.22).



- 22 -
7.03      Consultants for the Southern Jordan Power Development Study will
be engaged before July 31, 1975 and JEA will discuss with the Association
the recommendations resulting from this study and the actions it expects
to take (2.27).
7.04      The Government and JEA have agreed (5.06) that:
(i)  A final decision will be taken not later than March 31, 1976,
whether JEPCO's Marqa power station will be operated by JEPCO
as a "selected station" for and on behalf of JEA, or whether
Marqa will be acquired by JEA;
(ii)  Should Marqa be operated as a "selected station", a contract
acceptable to IDA will be executed between JEA and JEPCO be-
fore JEA and JEPCO before June 30, 1976; and
(iii)  Should Marqa be acquired by JEA, all necessary legal action
will be completed by June 30, 1976, and actual transfer of
all assets to JEA will be completed by December 31, 1976.
7.05      The Government and JEA have agreed that JEA's tariffs will be main-
tained at a level high enough to produce an annual rate of return of at least
9% on net fixed assets,in operation valued and revalued from time to time
in accordance with sound and consistently maintained methods acceptable to
the Association (5.07).
7.06      Assurances included in the 386-JO Guarantee Agreement have been
repeated for the proposed Credit that no return on Government's equity will
be declared or paid before 1979 unless in the opinion of the Association,
such a distribution would not be prejudicial to JEA's requirements for its
capital expansion. Similarly, assurances have also been obtained from the
Government that it will make arrangements satisfactory to the Association,
for providing funds for carrying out the Project and associated transmission
facilities (5.10).
7.07      JEA has agreed to extend the standard debt service covenant under
Credit 386-JO (5.13).
7.08      The introduction of a fuel price adjustment clause would be a con-
dition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit (2.21).
7.09      In view of the above agreements, the Project would provide a suit-,
able basis for an IDA Credit of US$5 million to be repaid over 50 years ir"
cluding a grace period of 10 years to be relent to JEA under a subsidiary
loan agreement acceptable to the Association (5.08).

APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND HUSSEIN THERMAL POWER PROJECT
JORDAN
The Histories of JEPCO and IDECO, and Development Program for Jordan Valley
1.        Electricity is distributed in Eastern North Jordan, the area which
will be supplied by the Project, by JEPCO and IDECO in their respective Con-
cession Areas. The composition, history and future developments of these
companies are described below:
The Jordanian Electric Power Company
2.        Prior to 1947 several small electric power companies were operating
independently in the Amman area. The Government decided at that time that
the activities of these companies should be unified and on August 14, 1947
the Transjordan Electric Power Company Limited was established, with paid up
capital of JD 121,900 to take over these small enterprises.  At the same time
the Government granted the company a concession to generate, transmit and dis-
tribute electrical energy in the area specified by the concession for a period
of 60 years after which the concession could be reviewed or the assets could
be purchased by the Government. The paid up capital was increased to JD
250,000 in 1955.
3.        As of January 1, 1963, the Transjordan Electric Power Company Limited
merged with the Jordan Central Electric Company which supplied the Zarqa con-
cession area, and the new company was named the Jordanian Electricity Power
Company Limited. The combined concession, covering the areas supplied by the
previous two companies, was established by law as published in the Official
Gazette No. 1651 dated November 22, 1962. The authorized capital of the new
company was JD 2,500,000 of which JD 2,040,000 was paid up.  Authorized
capital was later increased in 1973 to JD 6,000,000 with JD 4,588,468 paid
up. The nominal value of a share is one Jordan Dinar. The Company presently
(December 1974) is owned by 9,000 shareholders and the distribution of shares
is shown in the following table:
Shareholders                   No. of Shares             Z

4.        The Board of Directors of JEPCO comprises eleven members, two of
whom are representatives of the Government and the Municipality of Amman
respectively. Total staff is about 1,000 employees.
JEPCO's Expansion Program
5.        JEPCO is presently executing a 5-year development plan (1971-1975)
for the expansion of its own generation, transmission and distribution facil-
ities, pending the commissioning of bulk supplies from JEA's Zarqa station.
A UK loan of JD 3.1 million has been made, through JEA, towards the cost of
this program, which includes 3 diesel units of 6-MW site rating which were
installed and commissioned in early 1974. A fourth unit, financed from
JEPCO's own funds is expected to be commissioned by mid-1975. JEPCO's trans-
mission/distribution program provides for extending its 33-kV network and in-
cludes a routine expenditure of some JD 500,000 annually to develop the com-
pany's 220/380-kV network. The latter financial provisions appear adequate
to meet the increases in power requirements during the period. JEPCO's demand
exceeded its firm capacity in 1974. The fourth 6-MW diesel unit and the
Hussein I gas turbine financed from the Credit 386-JO are expected to meet
these requirements reasonably well except in the event of unscheduled outages.
JEPCO intends to retire and sell the Ras-Al-Ain and Zarqa diesel stations so
that the four newer diesels (24 MW) with the older (to be reconditioned)
diesel units at the Marka station, together with the gas turbine (12 MW)
will comprise the necessary reserve for the Zarqa station. By about 1978/79,
in order to meet JEPCO's requirements as well as those for IDECO (see below),
a further extension of the transmission system would also be required.
A
Irbid District Electricity Company
6.        The company was established as a private company in Irbid in 1957
under the name of Ajlun District Power Company. Irbid power station was ac-
quired in 1961 and the company was converted into a public company with an
authorized capital of JD 1,000,000. The name was changed to the Irbid
District Electricity Company. The Company was granted the present concession
under Law No. 1 dated 23 of January 1961 (as published in the Official Gazette
No. 1535 dated February 16, 1961). The concession is for a period of 50 years,
after which it can be renewed or the assets may be purchased by the Government.
7.        From 1962 onward IDECO has been acquiring smaller municipal under-
takings, a process that has been accelerated since 1968 when the company ob-
tained its first UK loan for expanding its transmission and distribution
system (see 9 below).
8.        The authorized capital of IDECO is still JD 1,000,000 of which
JD 881,217 has been paid up. The nominal value of a share is one Jordan
Dinar and the distribution of shares as of December 31, 1971, is shown in
the following table:

IDECO's Expansion Program
9.        IDECO, which recently completed its Stage I transmission and genera-
tion program with the assistance of JD 360,000 (equivalent) UK financing, ob-
tained two further UK loans through JEA of the equivalent of JD 300,000 and
JD 750,000 respectively toward expansion. The first loan covered the install-
ation of two 1-MW diesel units in the-existing station and the extension of
the 33-kV system by about 120 km. The second loan covered further 33-kV
extensions and the third construction of a new power station at Irbid with
three 3.2-MW diesel units. These works are expected to be completed by the
middle of 1975. Several large existing- pumping stations will all be connected
to the IDECO system for supply during off-peak hours, as soon as sufficient
capacity is available. IDECO's major construction is supervised by JEA.
Additionally, IDECO is budgeting an annual expenditure of some JD 120,000
for expansion of its 220/380-V facilities. IDECO plans to install two addi-
tional 3-MW generating units prior to 1978. By that time, or early in 1979,
the construction of a 70 km long 132-kV transmission line from Zarqa to Irbid
may well be justified.
Jordan Valley Rehabilitation and Development Plan
10.       The Government announced in 1973 its  3-year Rehabilitation and
Development Plan of the Jordan Valley. This plan envisages the migration of
some 100,000 persons to the Jordan Valley by 1980 to participate in the plan-
ned agricultural and environmental improvements of the valley. Towards the
achievement of this aim, the Plan includes a power development project com-
prising a 33-kV line along the valley (200 km including feeders and spurs)
and distribution networks for the expansion of existing townships, for new
settlements and for the pumping of irrigation and drinking water. The line
would be supplied in the north from the IDECO system and in the south from
the JEPCO system. Demand is expected to grow from about 6.5 MW in 1975/76
to 16 MW in 1980/81, including an off peak load for pumping of 2.3-3.6 MW.
Foreign cost of the project (about JD 1.2 million) is expected to be financed
by the German Kreditanstalt Bank. Lahmeyer, the Consultant for the project
has submitted a draft report in October, 1974. The project is expected to
be completed in 1977/78, which appears ambitious. The demand for power will
be entirely subject to progress made in implementing the Plan and to the
extent that the proposed influx of population is achieved and for this
reason this estimated load has not yet been taken into account in JEPCO's
or IDECO's load forecasts until firmer information is available on the
execution of the Plan.

Electric Power Rates and Tariff Studies
1.        JEA's laws require that the prices to be charged by undertakings
shall be in accordance with such tariffs as they may fix from time to time,
with the approval of the Cabinet on the recommendation of the Minister. No
specific concepts or regulations are set forth for the definitions of costs,
rate base, rate of return, etc.
2.        In practice a single and simple uniform tariff structure prevails
in the country, comprising block rates only. On a monthly basis they are the
following for the two most important companies (in fils 0.31 USJ per kWh):
JEPCO                                Fils/kWh       USE/kWh
First 50 kWh                            30            9.3
Next 2450 kWh                           15            4.6
Over 2500                               11            3.4
IDECO
First 50 kWh                            40           12.4
Next 50 kWh                             25            7.7
Next 900 kWh                            20            6.2
Over 1000 kWh                           15            4.6
3.        Special contracts are allowed at lower prices and normally this
takes the form of a discount. In the case of JEPCO, employees have a 75%
discount and institutions considered socially important (churches, hospitals,
schools, charity) 25%. For street lighting under a special contract, the
original discount was 30%. Each year, however, this increases by 5% and the
present situation in Amman is that within 3 years street lighting supply and
replacements will be fully subsidized by other consumers, the municipality
financing the extensions. In 1970, about 12% of all of JEPCO's supply was
at a discount, constituting about 6.3% of revenue. Similar discounts exists
in Irbid where, however, the discount for street lighting increases 10%
annually but is limited to a maximum of 60%. Some larger industrial consu-
mers have a special contract setting the highest block rate at 12 fils/kWh.
4.        As a condition for lending, JEA required JEPCO to have its tariffs
studied by an acceptable consultant to investigate if they could be reduced.
The company's costs were to be analyzed and recommendations were to be made
for any promotional activities to be initiated, including setting up a com-
mercial section. The study was completed by Kennedy and Donkin of the UK
in May 1972.

5.        A study of Jordan's electricity tariffs, financed by UK was sub-
stantially completed in 1974 by the North Eastern Electricity Board, UK.
A summary of its recommendations is included in the Appendix. The final
study which is expected to be completed in 1975, would take into account
the most recent information on costs, the forecast development program, and
the results of a tariff study being undertaken by JEPCO's consultants.

APPRAISAL OF

Recommended Tariff Structure
Memorandum of the North Eastern Electricity Board (UK)
on a tariff study for Jordan
1.        The aims of cost recovery and cost reflection are accepted as
suitable for Jordanian conditions. In particular the earning of proper rates
of return on capital and the pricing philosophy represented by marginal cost
pricing are both acceptable.
2.        The present block tariff and-discount structure is recognized as
unsatisfactory as it leads to the underpricing of some consumers and the over-
pricing of others with consequent cross-subsidization. Also the giving of
incentives to consumers to increase consumption economically is not defined
well in the present structure.
3.        Accordingly, the following tariff structure is agreed (see page 4)
and recommended as suitable for Jordanian conditions (No meter rentals are
charged in-addition):
A.   Standard Tariff
This is applicable to all Domestic and Small Commercial single
phase consumers.
The tariff is a two-block tariff consisting of a first higher
priced block of units and a final lower priced unit rate.
B.   Public Buildings Tariff
This is applicable to all places of worship, schools, hospitals
and other public buildings supplied single phase where the sup-
ply authority is satisfied that the use of electricity during
peak periods (i.e., 16.00 hours to 22.00 hours) is limited
and/or infrequent.
The tariff is of similar structure to the Standard Tariff but
at a reduced price level.
C.   Street Lighting Tariff
This is applicable to all street lighting and similar loads.
The tariff consists of a fixed charge per metering point and
a single unit rate.



ANNEX 8
Appendix 1
Page 2 of 4
D.   Off-Peak Tariff
This is applicable to all off-peak loads connected to an ap-
proved time switch controlled circuit which only allows use
of the supply during off-peak periods.
The'tariff consists of a fixed charge per metering point and
a single unit rate.
E.   Three Phase Tariff
This is ultimately applicable to three phase loads supplied
from the medium voltage network only but will initially apply
to all three phase loads (see F below).
The tariff consists of a modified form of the Standard Tariff
consisting of a larger first block of units at the first unit
rate of the Standard Tariff, a second block of units at the
final unit rate of the Standard Tariff, and a lower final unit
rate.
F.   Subscribed Service Capacity
This will apply to all consumers taking supply from an individual
transforming point on the h.v. (or e.h.v.) network.
The tariff consists of a fixed charge per kVa of agreed service
capacity (Subscribed Service Capacity) and two unit blocks (this
is a simplification of the original recommendation by omitting
the final block of units).
Special forms of charge based on the Subscribed Service capacity
Tariff will be negotiated for special large loads. An example
(Broadcasting and T.V. Special Tariff) is discussed in the main
report.
4.        As the Subscribed Service Capacity Tariff requires the collection
of load information from a trial installation of the special metering equip-
ment required, it is recommended that initially the Three Phase Tariff E be
applied to all three phase consumers.
It is also recommended that the Subscribed Service Capacity Tariff
(or its equivalent) be introduced into the concession area of JEPCO initially
and extended to the few suitable consumers in the concession area of IDECO
only after experience has been gained in JEPCO.
It is recognized that JEPCO are awaiting technical advice from their
consultants, Messrs. Kennedy & Donkin, on the recommended tariff form and the
possible alternative of a maximum demand type tariff. However, it is accepted
that a tariff is required for the larger consumer which contains an element
of charge related to kW demand (be it measured directly or by means of KVA
capacity required) in addition to blocks of units.



ANNEX 8
Appendix 1
Page 3 of 4
5.        It is recognized that the recommended tariff structure will lead
to increase prices to some consumers (particularly street lighting and to a
lesser extent the small domestic consumer) and to decrease prices to other
consumers (particularly industrial consumers). This is not inconsistent
with the assumed aims of the Government to encourage both the efficient use
of scarce resources and the industrial and commercial development of the
country.

ANNEX 10
Page 1 of 2
APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND HUSSEIN THERMAL POWER PROJECT
JORDAN
Outline of Terms of Reference for Southern Jordan Power Supply Development
1.        Power developments shall be studied in a geographical area bordered
by: in the north, the Wadi El-Mujib river north of the town of Karak; in
the east, the desert; in the south, the Gulf of Aqaba; and in the west, the
Dead Sea and the Wadi Araba depression.
2.        The consultants shall:
-    survey all electricity systems throughout the area, including
those under construction;
-    review and update previous reports on power supply for the area;
-    investigate existing development and future plans for industrial,
agricultural, tourist, rural, and urban developments in the area,
preparing forecasts of demand for the period 1976-85, taking into
account realistic assumption for the actual progress expected in
encountering the various plans, of which the most important are:
-    Expansion of the phosphate mine at El Hasa
-    The construction of a potash plant at Safi
-    Development of a copper mine at Fainan
-    Construction of a cement plant at Ma'an
-    Construction of a glass factory at Basta
Construction of a fertilizer plant at Aqaba
Workshops and housing at Aqaba and Ma'an for the
Aqaba Railway Corporation
Development of various tourist centers by the
Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities
-    Electrification of several villages in the study area
-    The Wadi Majib Irrigation Scheme
-    Socio-economic development of Ram Quweira, including
irrigation.



ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 2
3.        On the basis of their findings, the consultants shall:
-    determine the most practical and economic means of generation,
transmission, distribution of meeting the future power require-
ments in the area, applying the method of discounted cash flow
comparison of alternatives and using a suitable range of dis-
counIt rates, appropriate shadow prices (e.g. foreign exchange
and cost and unskilled labor); cost should be based on 1975
prices without escalation, excluding any taxes but including
any subsidies, the economic cost of fuel and secondary benefits
or penalties (environmental effects) to the extent possible and
realistic; the result of the study shall be submitted to a
sensitivity analysis with respect to the basic assumptions
(e.g. load forecast, capital costs, fuel costs, assumed
standards for reliabilities, etc.);
-    include in the basic alternatives, appropriate siting of power
stations at the load center or the location of a new oil refinery
that may be constructed in the area; this comparison should also
consider the environmental aspects with respect to the use of
water for cooling purposes;
-    prepare detailed cost estimate of the final scheme recommended,
construction programs, preliminary design of the required facil-
ities, and such information as may be required for final design
and preparation of bid documents.
4.        The consultants shall calculate the economic return on the least
cost development scheme recommended by comparing the benefits,as measured
by the projected revenues from electricity sales to consumers at the retail
level plus any other identifiable benefits, with the actual costs of supply-
ing them with electricity at that level.

APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND HUSSEIN THERMAL POWER PROJECT
JORDAN
JORDAN ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
Description of the Project
33-MW Steam-Electric Unit
1.        The proposed additional third unit will be added to the two similar
units being installed at Zarqa which is some 42 km northeast of Amman, located
adjacent to and just east of the Jordan Refinery in an area which is presently
unused for any purpose. This site has existing access facilities, an adequate
supply of water, proximity to the source of fuel with consequent savings in
cost, and remoteness from urban areas. The capacity of the power station
will be 99 MW with the addition of this unit, but site facilities are adequate
for the ultimate development of a power station of several hundred megawatts.
2.        The generating plant will consist of a 33-MW turbo-alternator set
and boiler, together with all anciliary equipment, switchgear, etc. The
turbine will be designed to operate with steam conditions of 850 psi and 900F.
The generator will operate at 3,000 rpm, is hydrogen cooled and rated at
38,825 kVA; 33,000 kW at 0.85 power factor, 13,800 volts, 50 cycles, 3 phase.
3.        The boiler will be of the outdoor multi-drum pressurized type with
provision of combustion air by forced draft fans. It will be designed to
burn local residual fuel oil and will be rated at 320,000 lbs per hour at
900'F with final feed water temperature of 395F. The firing aisle of the
boiler will be incorporated in the building housing the turbo generator and
auxiliary equipment. This is an economically designed building (Hussein
Stage I Construction) of steel frame construction with provision also for
housing the low voltage switchgear, the water treatment plant, offices and
other ancilliary facilities.
4.        Fuel will be supplied by pipeline to daily service tanks from the
adjacent oil refinery. Water for boiler make-up, cooling and other purposes
will be available from wells on the site. Eight wells have been drilled of
which five are productive with a total capacity of 1,800 gallons per minute.
In order to conserve water a multi-cell mechanical draft, closed circuit,
dry type radiator type heat exchanger will be installed on the roof of the
building.



ANNEX 1 1
Page 2 of 2
5.        The generator will be connected to a 13.8/132-kV step-up transformer
and the 132-kV substation will be an outdoor type structure with open buses.
All the net power generated will be fed into JEPCO's distribution system net-
work via a double ciruit 132-kV transmission line which is not part of the
Project.
6.        Although, except for a mechanical precipitator of 95% efficiency,
no means of cleaning exhaust gases would be installed, sufficient space will
be piovided to install such facilities if they are necessary in the future.
Marga Recouditioning
7.        The diesel-electric station at Marqa, presently.owned and operated
by JEPCO, would form part of the standby reserve for the Hussein Thermal
Station at Zarqa. JEPCO proposes to retire two older units of total capacity
2.9 MW. The remaining older units have cooling problems and have developed
cracks in the concrete bases. These will be completely dismantled and re-
conditioned adding radiator cooling to them. The machines having concrete
base trouble may have to be provided with skid-bases.
Southern Jordan Power Development Study
8.        The Project includes a power development study for Southern Jordan
(see Annex 10 for terms of reference).
Engineering
9.        Consultants services for the Project including the feasibility study
would be treated as a part of the project.

APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND HUSSEIN THERMAL POWER PROJECT
JORDAN
Justification of the Proposed Project
A.   Forecast of Sales and Demand
1.        JEPCO will be JEA's principal customer for several years after com-
missioning of the Zarqa plant and would require 80% or more of JEA's output
for the rest of the century.
2.        As shown in Appendix 1 historic trends have been used in forecasting
requirements for all categories except industries, subject to the following
observations.
(a) The historic data have been distorted due to the effects of
the 1967 war and the 1970 civil disturbances, but no adjust-
ments have been assumed in order to avoid over-optimistic
forecasts.
(b) The supply for "Social Purposes" (mosques, churches, hospitals,
schools, etc.) having a discount of 25% on the normal tariff,
has grown out of proportion, indicating the possibility of the
designation "social" beyond normal limits. It has been assumed
that the Government will take some action to reduce this desig-
nation and that future average growth will be about half historic
trend. Similarly, for street lighting, payment of which by mun-
icipalities is expected to phase out (but would be billed directly
to all consumers), it has been assumed that the Government will
wish to restrict the extraordinary growth trend of 18.2%. A
reduction to 14.3% annually is forecast.
3.        For industry, JEA in conjunction with JEPCO and the Ministries, have
recently initiated a census of all industrial plants under construction and
planned. At the time of appraisal a total of some 80 plants already had been
preliminarily identified. However, except for plant already committed and
under construction, it is expected that at least up to a year would be re-
quired to finalize the investigation and have available a list of plants and
a forecast of their requirements taking into account possible delay and actual
production pattern. For this reason it was assumed that industrial require-
ments, except large plants, would grow an average of 17.7% through 1980. This
assumption appears reasonable. A total of some 25 small factories (aggregat-
ing some 6.5 MW in capacity) already account for a growth rate of some 10%
through 1977, over and above the trend of 4.3%, for 1975-1977.



ANNEX 16
Page 2 of 5
4.        Large consumers to be connected (some of which have already been
completed, like the steel-mill, and await authorization to use electricity,
which depends on the commissioning of JEA's gas turbine) in 1975 and 1976 are
shown in Appendix 1. The major part of supply would be by JEPCO, JEA supply-
ing directly to the cement factory (which is executing an expansion program)
and the refinery at Zarqa. It is assumed that Irbid will be connected to the
Amman system in 1979, JEA supplying total requirements.
5.        Not taken into account has been the supply to the Jordan Valley.
The demand for power will be subject to progress made in implementing the
Jordan Valley Development Plan, which has suffered delays. It is not expected
that network construction will commence before 1976, and although initial
demand would be in the order of 6.5 MW (growing to 18 MW in the course of the
next 5 years), firm information, and realistic implementation schedules should
be available before including the supply in the forecast.
6.        Also not included are forecasts of possible supply to factories
presently generating their own requirements, due to the uncertainties in this
respect, thus once more using a prudent approach to avoid over-optimistic
assumptions.
7.        Annex 14 shows the Balances of Energy and Capacities, resulting from
the study. Comparison of the previous appraisal estimates, the present esti-
mate and the consultants estimates for the Project, shows the following:

/1   Historic increased by 3% (assumed minimum suppression)
8.        The differences ara considerable but the basic new forecast, i.e.
excluding supplies to the large new consumers, is in general agreement with
the previous forecast taking into account the smaller new industrial connec-
tions already identified in part (see 3 above). This is because trend growth
rates have been used for both projects, to which large consumers were added;
the latter have increased considerably and largely account for the increase
in the forecast.



ANNEX 16
Page 3 of 5
9.        The above table also shows considerable differences with the con-
sultant's forecast in the earlier years, due mainly to conservative appraisal
assumptions for demand of new consumers. By 1978, however, both forecasts are
in general agreement. The appraisal forecast appears reasonable taking the
large pending demand that could not be met in the last 4-5 years (of which
the proliferation of captive plant is a direct indication).
10.       Because the third unit at the Hussein Power Station cannot be com-
pleted before 1978, it follows from the balance of capacities (see Annex 14)
that a small capacity shortage would persist throughout the period and that
further plant would be required by 1979, if not earlier. For this reason
it has been assumed that gas turbine plant (24 MW) would be required by 1979,
and a fourth unit (66 MW) by 1980. The third Hussein unit could only be
postponed by one year if 1978 demand would not exceed 95 MW (installed capa-
city 1977/78 128 MW less largest unit of 33 MW) compared with 131 MW as now
forecast. This is considered highly unlikely (and practically impossible
assuming no further difficulties in the region) because this would negate the
large additional consumers scheduled for connection constituting some 30-35 MW
(most would be operating during the peak) and 100-130 GWh.
B.  Comparison of Alternatives
11.       During appraisal of the first power project two basic alternatives
were compared, one comprising an all steam development with 33-MW initial unit
size, and the second comprising a diesel/stream development with 10-MW diesels
and 33-MW initial steam units. As variations to these alternatives, different
steam unit sizes were also considered and a high and low growth trends were
assumed to test sensitivity of the results with respect to growth. It should
be noted that the highest growth rate assumed (18.3% average for 1972-1980) is
well below the present forecast - assumed 1980 generation was 638 GWh compared
with the present forecast of 786 GWh (1973-1980 growth rate 23.1% p,a.).
12.        The general conclusion of the comparison of alternatives reached
at that time were the following:
(a) at whatever time in the future it is decided to change from
diesel generation to steam generation, steam capacity to be
installed should be about equal to the diesel capacity avail-
able at the time of conversion;
(b) any such development can be expected to appear relatively
marginal because this is inherent in a complete technological
change;
(c) delay in the changeover to steam will cause higher financial
requirements and will make more diesel capacity obsolete at
the time of the change; and therefore it is prudent to make
the change to steam plant without further delay.



ANNEX 16
Page 4 of 5
13.       Actual development and expected increase in demand to be met has
confirmed these viewpoints and the Government's decision to convert to steam-
plant generation, particularly in view of the expected higher growth rate.
The previous study concluded:
(a) under the assumed high growth rate (of 18.3% p.a. see 11 above)
the equalizing discount rate up to which an all steam develop-
ment would be the least cost development, would be 15.3%.
(Sensitivity considerations indicate that at a higher growth
rate--of 23% as presently forecast--the equalizing discount
rate would be in the order of 17%).
(b)  the results are insensitive to changes in operational cost.
(c) the results are little sensitive to variation in capital cost.
(Doubling of capital cost would decrease the equalizing dis-
count rate for the high growth rate scheme to about 13%, which
is above the opportunity cost of capital in Jordan, expected
to range from 10-12%).
(d) the results are relative insensitive to the cost of fuel.
(Tripling fuel cost to about US$10/bbl would decrease the
equalizing discount rate for the present growth rate to
about 14.5%, i.e. above the assumed opportunity cost of
capital in Jordan.)
14.       Because for the previous project the alternative all-steam develop-
ments (in which unit size and growth rate were assumed as variables) were
compared with a common diesel/steam development (only the growth rate was
varied) the conclusions are still applicable in comparing the all-steam de-
velopments among each other (the alternative common to all of these steam
developments would be eliminated by subtracting net present values of two
streams), provided conditions 13(a) and 13(b) mentioned above are met. Be-
cause these conditions are indeed being met, assuming doubling of capital
cost since the previous appraisal in accordance with actual price increases
observed since 1973, the basic development scheme outlined in the previous
study is sustained: JEA should install a total of three 33-MW units in the
Zarqa station (for both economic and technical reasons in view of reserve
capacity requirements) followed by 66-MW units. It appears necessary, de-
pending on actual load growth, that by mid-1976 JEA should investigate the
economic justification of installing by 1978 or 1979 additional gas turbine
capacity before the fourth unit (66 MW) is commissioned at Zarqa.
C.   Economic Return of Project
15.       The internal economic rate of return (IER) of the Project is the
discount rate which equates the present values of the time streams of the
attributable costs and benefits over the Project's assumed life of 25 years.
In the case of this Project financial costs and benefits have been used in



ANN"EX 16
Page 5 of 5
the analysis since no shadow pricing of inputs and adjustment for taxes was
considered appropriate. The IER is therefore expressed as an internal fi-
nancial rate of return (IFR). The costs are the capital cost of the third
unit at the Hussein power station (JD 5.3 million), the reconditioning of
the older diesels at JEPCO's Marqa station (JD 0.4 million), Stage 2 of the
132-kV transmission system (JD 2.0 million), a portion of the 30-kV regular
expansion, assumed at 200 km (JD 1.2 million), a share in the cost of dis-
tribution expansion, assumed at 2 years (JD 2.0 million), plus the cost of
operating the additional facilities. Willingness to pay, measured mainly
through the revenues, has been used as a first approximation of the attrib-
utable benefits. These revenues understate the benefits consumers receive
from the Project because it is considered that a tariff increase of reason-
able magnitude (say 20%) would not reduce demand significantly. This is
further illustrated by the fact that large capacities in costly captive plant
have been installed (and would be installed were the Project not executed)
to meet the electricity needs.
16.       The IFR is about 15% on the basis of the present tariffs.  Assum-
ing that the cost of the third unit at the Hussein station has been 20% over-
estimated, or underestimated, the IFR would respectively be 13.3% and 16.7%.
An increase in fuel cost by 50% would decrease the IFR to 12%. Sensitivity
tests further indicate that the IFR would be about 13.5% in the event that
all costs would have been underestimated by 10%. On the other hand, in the
event all operating costs (excluding fuel) have been overestimated by 20%,
the IFR increases to 14.4%. Assuming that inaccuracies have been made in
the attribution of transmission and distribution facilities to the Project,
a 20% underestimate would decrease the IFR to 12.7%, and a 20% overestimate
would increase the IFR to 17%. Sensitivity to average revenue per kWh is
the following: underestimate of 10%, IFR increases to 18%; overestimate
of 10%, IFR decreases to 11.8%. The range of the IFR is 12-18%, with most
likely average of 15%.

Economic Rate of Return on Project
Assumptions for Costs and Attribution of Costs to the Project
Capital, end 1974 prices
-    Hussein Stage 2 Unit:  100% of capital cost (excluding price
contingency; no import duties are levied); JD 5.3 million
-    Reconditioning of older JEPCO diesels; JD 0.4 million
-    132-kV Transmission:  Second stage, to be completed by 1978;
ID 2.0 million
-    30-kV Transmission:  200 km; JD 1.2 million
-    Distribution:  2 year program, assumed to increase to JD 1 m/a;
JD 2.0 million
Fuel Costs
-    Hussein Stage 2 Unit:  Generation 100 GWh in 1978 and 175 GWh
(load factor 60%) from 1979 onward; heat-rate average 3,270
kcal/kWh (13,000 Btu/kWh); fuel-oil price JD 6.5/t or JD 0.187/106
Btu (US$0.603/106 Btu), i.e. JD 2,440/GWh.
-    Diesels:  Generation of the older, reconditioned, diesels 50 GWh
in 1977, 65 GWh in 1978, 85 GWh in 1979, 45 GWh in 1980, and
25 GWh for another 5 years, before retirement; cost equal to the
total 1973 and 1974 fuel cost of JD 2,400/GWh (including diesel-
oil for starting and lubrication).
Operation and Maintenance
-    Hussein Stage 2 Unit:  30% of fuel cost (previous assumption was
15% of fuel cost; this implies a doubling of all costs, including
spares since 1972).
-    Diesel Plant:  JEPCO's records for 1973 and 1974 for the Marqa
station show about JD 800/GWh for maintenance and JD 500/GWh for
operation, or a total of JD 1,300/GWh. After reconditioning
the costs are assumed to decrease to JD 1,000/GWh.

3%/a of investment; total JD 56,000/a.
Distribution:  5%/a of investment; JD 100,000/a.
Sales and Revenue
-    Sales in GWh: Total generation of Hussein Stage 2 and recon-
ditioned diesels, less 20% losses.
-    Revenue at an average retail price level of JD 0.016 (JD 16,000/GWh)

APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND HUSSEIN THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(JORDAN)
JEPCO Financial Situation
Fixed Assets and Long-Term Debt
1.        JEPCO's actual financial situation at December 31, 1973, was sound
as shown by its Balance Sheet on page 3 of this Annex. The JD 6.8 million
in net fixed assets mainly represented the balance of the original cost of
its three diesel electric generating stations at Ras-al-Ain (built 1948) Zarqa
(built 1958) and Marqa (first unit 1962), plus its distribution networks in
and around Amman, some 330 km of 44-kV and 6.6-kV transmission and asset
revaluation. In 1971, JEPCO started on a 5-year construction program financed
by a JD 3.1 million (E3.6 million) UK loan to the Government and relent (via
JEA) to JEPCO at 6% over 15 years including a 3-year grace period. JD 1.1
million of this was for 3 x 6 MW diesel generating sets at Marqa and the
remaining JD 2.0 million for 33-kV transmission. The report assumes that by
1977 Ras-al-Ain and Zarqa diesels would be retired and Marqa would be acquired
by JEA.
Equity
2.        As of September 1974, JD 4.6 million was paid up out of JEPCO's
authorized nominal capital of JD 6 million. Only 10% of its shares was held
by the Government or municipalities, the remainder being private holdings.
Total equity of JD 5.4 million in 1973 is expected to increase to JD 8 million
by 1980 despite the annual distribution of reasonable amount of dividends.
JEPCO's debt/equity ratio was 17:83 in 1973 and is only expected to reach
30:70 in 1974 before dropping to 14:86 in 1976 and declining thereafter at a
uniform rate of 2% per annum in debt.
Current Assets
3.        In 1973 JEPCO's current assets were 1.26 times current liabilities.
In 1971 its consumer accounts receivable was at an abnormally high level of
JD 244,000 (equivalent to 66 days billings). JEPCO has since improved its
procedures and has reduced consumer outstandings to about 15.7% of sales or
the equivalent of 57 days billings, which is an acceptable level.



ANNEX 24
Page 2 of 5
Income Statements
4.        JEPCO's income statements (pages 3 through 5 of this Annex) show
that the tariffs, 1/ would be adequate till 1978. With the advent of JEA's
Zarqa power station JEPCO's rate of return is expected to drop to about 7.9%
in 1979. It would drop to a figure as low as 3.8% in 1980 unless tariffs are
suitably revised as recommended by NEEB to permit JEPCO a minimum of 9% return.
In estimating JEPCO's expenditure and income, it was assumed that due to the
forecast increase in the industrial load at the average growth rate of 27.9%
per year the average retail tariff will reduce from 16 fils/kWh in 1975 to
15 fils/kWh in 1980. Other major financial assumptions are shown in Annex 17.
Sources .nad'Applications of Funds
5.        JEPCO's future construction program through 1980 is shown in its
Sources and Applications (page 5 of this Annex) and comprises general exten-
sions and reinforcements of its distribution network costing about JD 600,000
annually. This will be additional to the cost of the 4 diesel units and 33-kV
lines mentioned in 1 above and to miscellaneous items such as vehicles and
office equipment, etc.  Debt service for the forecast period except 1976 is
covered at least 2.5 times by net cash generation. In the year 1976 the
ratio appears low due to the accelerated repayment of part of the UK devel-
opment loan it received through JEA (see Annex,22),.
1/   JEPCO's forecast tariffs are based on JEA's forecast average selling
prices at constant (1974) JD (see 'Case B' forecasts at Annex 25). Any
change in JEA's tariffs to provide for inflation and on account of re-
valuation of assets (see Case A at Annexes 19 thru 21) is expected to
hp passed on to the consumers.
