PROJECT COMPI.ETION REPORT
INDIA: THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED
LOAN 1097-IN AND LOAN 1475-IN
HIGHLIGHTS
The two loans subject of this review were the eleventh for US$100 million
and twelfth for US$80 million of a series of fourteen loans, totaling
US$765 million, made to date to the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation
of India Ltd. (ICICI). The Bank's association with ICICI dates back to the
Corporation's establishment in 1955. The Bank's objectives under these two loans
were to continue to tutilize ICICI as an efficient channel for financing high
priority industrial projects and to undertake studies of specific industrial
development problems and support its promotional efforts (para. 5).
Both loans were disbursed in a timely fashion to finance projects which
have had a positive impact on industrial development in India (para. 23).
Compared to previous Bank loans, the eleventh and twelfth loans were utilized
for more projects located in backward areas in line with agreed objectives
(para. 25), the projects were implemented more efficiently and are operating
satisfactorily (para. 27). Also, ICICI has successfully developed new operations
to assist industry, primarily in the areas of merchant banking and leasing
(para. 11). It also is involved in promoting industrial research and improving
labor and management skills through assistance to various technical institutions
in India (para. 18). With Bank support and assistance, ICICI has also initiated
more policy-oriented sector work, which has served as basis and has led to the
formulation of the Bank's proposed Industrial Export Development Project and
Cement Project (para. 29). Other important developments at ICICI have been the
sizeable amount of foreign currency resources mobilized in the international
markets (para. 21), the reorganization of its operational structure along subsec-
toral lines (para. 11), the strengthening of its regional offices, and the con-
tinuity and ability of its management (paras. 10 and 29). However, ICICI will
need to be more actively involved in the appraisal, implementation and supervi-
sion of projects financed with bank consortia, and to take steps to improve loan
collections (para. 22). Overall, ICICI is successful in adapting its operations
to changes and constraints in the financial and industrial environment and
thereby promote efficient and profitable operstions (para. 29). These two loans
were helpful in contributing to institutional improvements in ICICI, reinforcing
ICICI's development objectives and increasing ICICI's role in making recommenda-
tions on industrial policy reform.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA: THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED
LOAN 1097-IN AND LOAN 1475-IN
1.      Loan 1097-IN for US$100.0 million was the eleventh loan extended to ICICI
under a Loan Agreement signed on April 2, 1975. The Loan carries an 8.5% rate of
interest repayable in accordance with a composite of amortization schedules of
subloans with a maximum maturity of 15 years including grace period of up to
5 years. The Loan became effective on July 1, 1975.
2.      Loan 1475-IN for US$80.0 million was the twelfth loan to ICICI, which
became effective on October 4, 197i, under a Loan Agreement signed on July 22,
1977.  Loan 1475-IN carries an 8.2% p.a. rate of interest repayable in accordance
with a composite of amortization schedules of subloans with a maximum maturity of
15 years including a grace period of up to 5 years.
I. BACKGROUND
3.      ICICI was established in 1955 with an initial capital issue of Rs 50
million to provide financial assistance to industry and to promote the develop-
ment of Indian capital markets.  The Bank Group was actively involved in ICICI's
establishment, as it assisted in setting-up a steering committee and organizing a
strong group of private shareholders. After a slow start in the first three or
four years, ICICI operations grew steadily through the sixties and seventies and
contributed significantly to industrial development in India. Throughout the
30 years of its existence ICICI has been the prime source of foreign currency
financing to private industry. As of December 31, 1984, its paid-up capital and
reserves stood at Rs 1,327.2 million and its cumulative assistance to industry
since 1955 totaled Rs 24,250.0 million. Since ICICI's establishment, the World
Bank has extended 14 loans for a total amount of US$765 million, of which the two
loans covered in this report are the Eleventh and TweLfth, respectively. This
long association with ICICI has been satisfactory, as Bank funds have been allo-
cated efficiently and judiciously while ICICI developee into a mature, well-
managed and diversified financial institution.
4.      Previous PCRs.  The last PPAR (PCR included) was issued on April 24,
1981, covering the Ninth (Loan 789-IN) and Tenth (Loan 902-IN) Loans to ICICI.
The report's main conclusion was that ICICI continued to be a viable, profitable,
well-managed, and mature financial institution. It suggested that ICICI should
capitalize on its stature and maturity to develop into a more "dynamic and pace-
setting institution" in development efforts, i.e. expand clientele and the
geographic coverage of its operations. The report also suggested a "target
approach" to achieve specific development objectives. As a strategy, ICICI opted
to intensify projec: promotion to complement efforts of other GOI agencies in
developing new entrepreneurs and backward areas. With Bank assistance under the
proposed First Industrial Export Project, ICICI is adopting a "target epproach"
by sector and activity with important and substantial support to oOI's policy
measures to promote increased competitiveness and exports of manufactured
products, especially engineering products.



-2-
5.      Objectives.  The basic objective of both loans under review was to con-
tinue to utilize ICICI as an efficient channel for financing high priority
industrial projects, encourage ICICI to undertake studies of specific industrial
development problems, and support its promotionel efforts. Appraisal and sub-
sequent negotiations on both loans dealt with adjustments in ICI'Is
organization, procedures, and strategies to achieve more effective operations.
The recommended and agreed adjustments within ICICI centered on the diversifica-
tion of both local and foreign currency resources, the strengthening of regional
offices, the building-up of sector information to g'ide lending strategy, and the
revision of lending rates to reflect the cost of funds and allow adequate opera-
tional margins. During the implementation of these loans, close contact was
maintained between ICICI and the Bank and these adjustments were largely carried
out, making ICICI's assistance to industry more effective.
II. ENVIRONMENT
6.      The period covered in this report, from effectiveness of the Eleventh
Loan in July 1975 to the closing of the Twelfth Loan in September 1983, witnessed
many changes in the environment affecting industrial development and the finan-
cial institutions. The period opened under the full effects of world price
increases and stagflation that followed the first world oil crisis, and closed
with the equally adverse effects of the second major oil price increase. Indit,
however, came through tCis difficult period without major economic disruptions.
This was possible mainly because of the relatively minor importance of the
country's external economy, although other factors also facilitated the
adjustment. Principal among these were: (a) high foreign exchange reserves built
up during the late sixties and early seventies; (b) channelling of product
surpluses to exports as world prices rose in the mid-seventies; (c) demand for
labor and services in the Middle East, resulting in remittance flows from Indian
laborers and businesses migrating to that area. This period, however, was also
characterized by low levels of economic activity, with GDP growth averaging
3.8% p.a. The situation in the industrial sector was a reflection of the macro
picture. During the period, industrial value added expanded by an average rite
of 4.2% p.a., as compared to 5.6% p.a. during the 1961-1970 period. Industrial
development was hindered by: the slow rise in disposable incomes, particularly in
the rural areas; raw material shortages resulting from complex import
regulations; poor weather conditions in some years; serious infrastructural
deficiencies in energy and transport; and a restrictive environment resulting
from government regulatory policies in the sector. With a favorable balance of
payments position and some relaxation in industrial and trade regulations,
industrial growth has picked up. Expectations are that this trend will continue,
but more steps still need to be taken to liberalize further restrictions on
investments and imports. A favorable development during the period was the
expansion of manufactured exports, led by engineering products. This was
facilitated by rising world prices which attracted exports. Although these
exports were mostly production not absorbed by the internal market, it had a
demonstration effect that may prove to be longer lasting if supported by
appropriate policy adjustments which provide stronger incentives and support for
exports.



-3-
7.      During the period 1975-1983, gross domestic capital formation in industry
was characterized by the substantial expansion of public sector investment.
Private industrial investment, which accounted for 31.3X of total industrial
investment in 1916, was reduced to 15.5! by 1979 and recovered partially Lo 26.1S
by 1983, as the general performance of the economy improved. During most of the
period, however, private industrial activity suffered from policy, infrastructure
and power supply constraints; all of which, together with labor disturbances,
affected adversely its performance and financial results. Declining
profitability at the firm level in turn affected the pattern of industrial
financing, tending toward greater dependence on external finance. In the area of
short term finance, private industry relied more heavily on non-institutional
sources of finance, 1/ particularly as commercial banks had to yield resources to
the demands of agricultural production, public sector enterprises, and other
priority allocations. In the area of term financing, private industry increased
the pressure on the development finance institutions to expand their operations
to make up for the reduction in reinvestable profits. More recently, since 1981,
with GOI taking some liberalizing steps in financial instruments, some of this
pressure was reduced as public offerings of bonds and debentures have gained
increasing acceptance in the market. Still, the contribution of the financial
institutions' assistance for term lending, as a percentage of private industrial
investment, increased from 15.7X in 1976 to 50.4X in 1983.
8.      In this context, ICICI continued to be the principal source of foreign
exchange funds, accounting for over 80Z of foreign exchange loans extended by the
financial inst{tutions to the private industrial sector. However, the require-
ments for rupee financing have been much more significant. Consequently,
although expanding rapidly over the past years, ICICI's assistance in relation to
total private industrial investment has been decreasing and was only 7.1! at the
end of 1984. Furthermore, its activities, as those of other financial
institutions, fall under a guideline limiting the maximum size of loan that a
finencial institution can commit (presently around Rs. 30 million) to a single
enterprise. To arrange financing in excess of the guideline amount, the
All-India financial institutions operate on a consortium basis. The consortium
appoints a "lead" institution to appraise proposals which exceed the limit. The
institutions then subscribe to participation certificates on the basis of this
appraisal. Participation by all institutions in one proportion or another is
normally expected, with ICICI providing most of the foreign currency
requirements. In 1983, consortium financing accounted for 59X of ICICI's total
lending operations, down slightly from levels exceeding 60! in previous years.
ICICI has been successful in undertaking competent appraisal of projects, par-
ticularly on economic evaluation. However, ICICI should continue to guard
against the potential pressures to finance doubtful projects led by other members
of a consortium, particularly since ICICI is often the primary source of foreign
exchange financing in such consortia, while the critical stages of implementation
and supervision remain the responsibility of the lead institution.

III. PERFORMANCE OF ICICI
Institutional Aspects
9.     Ownership.  About 79% of ICICI's share ^apital is held by public institu-
tions as a result of the nationalization of banks and insurance companies.
Foreign commercial banks hold 14% and the balance of 7% is held by about 4,000
private Indian investors. Under the Companies Act ICICI is classified as a
government company, as the public sector holds more than 5OX of its shares.
However, this classification does not affect ICICI's operational autonomy, except
in respect of the procedures for appointing auditors. Relations between GOI and
the Corporation are good and, because of its close relations with the business
community, ICICI continues to be an important link between the private sector and
the Government.
10.     Management.  ICICI is well-managed and operates effectively under the
guidance of an experienced Board and competent staff. During the period covered
by the loans, Mr. S.S. Mehta was Managing Director until 1979 and then Chairman
until early 1984, when Mr. S.S. Nadkarni, Managing Director (1979-1984), assumed
the Chairman's post. The Board consists of 14 members in addition to the
Chairman. Two represent GOI, one the financial institutions, two the foreign
shareholders, one is ICICI's Deputy Managing Director and eight are businessmen
and professionals. The Board meets regularly, sets ICICI's overall financial and
operational policies and decides on individual loan proposals involving an
exposure above Rs 10 million. During the period under review, the Board provided
the direction, guidance and support to management necessary to expand and diver-
sify ICICI's activities.
11.     Organization.  ICICI's Organization Chart is attached as Annex 1.  Major
organizational changes and more decentralized decision-making and authority were
made in 1982 and 1983 to respond to a more dynamic industrial inveat.ment
environment. Non-traditional activities, such as merchant banking, leasing,
management services, investment counselling to overseas residents, and resource
planning, were given more importance. The reorganization aimed at:
(a) strengthening the appraisal and supervision functions by developing expertise
along subsector lines; (b) recognizing the contributions of experienced staff;
and (c) providing openings for promotion of younger professionals. Under the new
structure, the management team consists of the Chairman and the Deputy Managing
Director, Mr. S.V. Shah. Five groups: operations; development and planning;
finarce; merchant banking and rehabilitation; and regional offices make up
ICICI's core organizational structure.
12.        The Operations Group, headed by the General Manager, is the largest in
professional staff and volume of business. The group is responsible for apprais-
ing new loans and monitoring the portfolio; in the past, the supervision function
was carried out by a separate department. The new arrangement is useful for more
immediate feedback and could produce closer and more effective supervision



-5-
arising from established contact and knowledge of the project/company and more
identifiable accountability. Most legal staff, who were previously in a separate
Legal Department, were brought into the Operations Group. The objective is to
reduce the period between appraisal and loan signing. However, some legal
matters, which by their nature take time, and also legal issues not directly
related to the loan documents will continue to be handled by the Legal
Department, which reports to the General Manager and Legal Adviser. The Finance
and Resource Planning Group is headed by a Deputy General Manager, and is divided
into two subgroups, foreign exchange and accounts, and resources and management
information. With the increased importance of borrowings from foreign commercial
sources, the resource mobilization function has been given a more prominent role
in ICICI's structure. The merchant banking and rehabilitation functions are
presently supervised by a Deputy Ceneral Manager assisted by an Assistant General
Manager. The functions are divided into two departments, Merchant Banking and
Rehabilitation. The Rehabilitation Department is responsible for the problem
projects, which are transferred from the operating divisions when more in-depth
analysis and substantial rehabilitation measures are needed for their
restructuring. This Department carries out intensive monitoring of hard-core
cases and is looked after by experienced and senior staff. The Development and
Planning Group has three functions: market and economic research;
administration; and cons.ltancy services to other DFIs and other developmental
activities. Regional offices report directly to the Deputy Managing-Director.
ICICI now has three regional offices in New Delhi, Madras, and Calcutta staffed
with 52 professionals who carry out a good portion of the promotional, appraisal
and supervision functions for projects in those areas. The New Delhi office is
responsible for liaison with the Government in addition to its lending functions.
ICICI started its leasing operation in early 1983, and this business has grown
rapidly. The Leasing Division is headed by a competent middle-level manager in
ICICI. A corporate office with a senior person as Executive Assistant was
created to ensure that performance is evaluated through a comprehensive manage-
ment information system.
13.     Policy/Strategy.  During the first 20 years of activity ICICI had no
formal policy statement, but relied on its Memorandum of Association, together
with government guidelines and the periodic resolutions of its Board, to provide
a satisfactory operating policy framework. However, in 19f7 at the Bank's
prompting, the Corporation's Board adopted a Statement of Financing Strategy,
which set out, in general terms, its intentions for lending. In this statement,
six broad areas were specified for priority attention: (a) export oriented
industries; (b) power and transport projects; (c) manufacturers of agricultural
inputs and processors of agricultural outputs; (d) mass consumption goods;
(e) capital equipment and tool manufacturers; and (f) balancing and modernization
projects. The statement also noted ICICI's commitment to promote projects in
backward areas and new entrepreneurs. This policy statement was reaffirmed on
the occasion of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth loans to the Corporation.
14.     ICICI's appraisal procedures and standards continued to be satisfactory
during the period under review. Similarly, project implementation and supervi-
sion have received continuous and systematic attention by competent staff.
Quarterly progress reports are required during implementation, in addition to
periodic visits by staff. Problem projects are handled by a separate unit and,



-6-
in serious cases, ICICI has appointed a Director to the enterprise's Board (as it
is empowered to do by the terms of its Loan Agreements). These Directors provide
additional monitoring and, together with the Rehabilitation Unit, have often been
instrumental in bringing about solutions to a company's problems.
Recent Performance
15.     ICICI had another year of good performance in 1984.  Disbursements during
the year totaled Rs 3,881 million, an increase of 162 over the Rs 3,348 million
disbursed in 1983. The 312 projects financed are expected to generate 600,000
new jobs, and contribute added value equal to Rs 10,400 million. Of the assis-
tance sanctioned, 57 was for projects in the backward areas and 50X was for new
projects. Leasing operations aggregated Rs 223 million against Rs 121 million in
1983. The Merchant Banking Division was successful in raising Rs 5,050 million
for its clients. ICICI also underwrote issues of shares and debentures totaling
Rs 157 million and subscribed directly to shares and debentures valued at Rs 50
million. These operations and other services to the industrial sector and finan-
cial institutions resulted in a profit after ta.; of Rs 221 million, or a return
on equity of 25X, which compares favorably with the results in previous years.
This return is high, since ICICI increased its equity capital by 50% during the
year. At the end of 1984, its authorized capital was Rs 500 million of which
Rs 405 million were issued and fully paid. Collections of amounts due in 1984
amounted to Rs 1,964 million, representing a collection rate of 73%. Net of
Rs 350 million in rescheduling, total arrears as of year end stood at Rs 366
million, or 1.8% of outstanding loan portfolio. ICICI's liquidity position and
debt service capability remained satisfactory. During the year ICICI's efforts
at resource diversification continued; ICICI obtained two syndicated loans for
US$40 million, Stg 10 million, ECU 30 million, private placement of bonds worth
JY 5,000 million and credit line of DM 25 million from KfW (equivalent to US$114
million in 1984 compared to US$54 million in 1983). For the first time, ICICI
also raised additional local currency funds of Rs 155 million from long term
deposits and loans from the Army Group Insurance Fund, the Unit Trust of India,
and the Life Insurance Corporation. The financial condition of ICICI remains
sound with totaL assets of Rs 16.5 billion, of which Rs 14.9 billion were loans
to industry; equity was Rs 1.3 billion, or 62 of total assets.
Operational Performance
16.     A comparative summary of ICICI's operational performance for 1978-1983,
is shown in Annex 2. 1/ As of December 31, 1983, ICICI had approved financing
totaling Rs 26.4 billion (US$2.4 billion) for 3,764 projects, committed Rs 22.8
billion, and disbursed Rs 19.7 billion. During the 1978-1983 period, ICICI
increased its lending operations at a compounded annual rate of about 26%. By
1983, foreign currency loans were 5 times the amount in 1978, while rupee loans
1/ The Completion Report on Loans 789-IN and 902-IN covered the period,
1911-1977.



were twice the amount in 1978. The growth of ICICI's operations compare
favorably with the rate of growth in private industrial investment, which was
about 16% p.a. for the corresponding period. ICICI's actual performance was
generally higher than projected; during 1978-1983 period, actual cumulative
approvals and total disbursements were 44% and 29% higher than projected amounts
respectively. Additionally, during this period ICICI's operations expanded in
new areas, with merchant banking and leasing operations becoming important in its
overall assistance to industry. Because of the substantial increase in non-
lending operations and more demand for locally manufactured equipment, the share
of foreign currency lending as a percentage of ICICI's total operations was
declining from a high of 37% in 1981 to 31% 1983.
17.     In addition to its direct lending, investment operations and merchant
banking activities, ICICI undertakes a broad range of complementary activities
and services aimed at enhancing its overall developmental impact. In this
respect, ICICI undertakes industrial subsector and policy studies, identifies and
promotes new projects, participates in backward area development programs,
promotes industrial research, and offers training and support services to other
domestic and foreign financial institutions. Most of these activities were
initiated following the joint Bank ICICI study of the Corporation's developmental
impact in 1973. Since then, the Bank has been actively involved in planning some
of these activities, particularly the industrial studies. In accordance with
agreements reached between ICICI and the Banks the focus of these activities
involve addressing major industrial bottlenecks, encouraging improvements in
industrial efficiency and improving the export performance of the manufacturing
sector. ICICI's program of industrial subsector and policy studies was, in fact,
initiated under Loan 1097-IN, with a study on manufactured exports. Loan 1475-IN
also involved a study of the automotive sector. In addition to these major
studies, ICICI completed a number of shorter papers on subjects such as price and
distribution controls in the sugar and cement industries, the impact of
industrial licensing regulations, and the economics of small cement, steel, and
paper plants. Under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth loans, three other studies
were completed: one on energy utilization and conservation in industry, another
on the electrical equipment manufacturing subsector, and the last on a survey of
exporters of manufactured goods. In addition, ICICI participated in the Bank's
study of the cement subsector. These studies and papers have received wide
circulation in India and have been used by various government committees in their
review of different aspects of industrial policy.
18.     ICICI's other development activities involved assistance in training for
other financial institutions. ICICI also participated actively in the estab-
lishment of a Foreman Training Institute, and a Financial Management and Research
Institute. In collaboration with the other financial institutions, ICICI has set
up several state technical consultancy institutions to assist new entrepreneurs.
In addition, apart from its regular activity in training staff from other Indian
and foreign development banks, ICICI has seconded staff to DFCs in other
countries and has been involved in consultancy assignments in support of Bank
lending in Sri Lanka, Ghana, Jamaica, and Nepal. ICICI has also made financial



-8-
contributions to industrial research to develop new indigenous industrial
technologies.
Financial Results and Condition
19.     ICICIVs income statements for the period 1978-1984 are summarized in
Annex 3. During this period, ICICI has performed exceptionally well; from
1980-1984, return on equity was maintained at about 25% compared with about 15%
from 1978-1980. The improvement in profit was due to higher volume of
operations, wider operating margins, and lower effective tax rates. Interest
rate gross spread increased from 2.8% in 1980 to 3.8% in 1983, as the interest
charges to borrowers were revised upward. Administrative expenses measured as
percentage of average total assets declined from 0.6% in 1978 to 0.5% in 1984.
Fee based income from ICICI's non-lending operations increased from Rs 4 million
in 1978 to Rs 24 million in 1984. Compared to projected figures, its actual
gross income was higher on the average by 21% per year, and net profit by A3%.
20.     Annex 4 shows ICICI's balance sheets for 1978-1984.  ICICI's total assets
reached the US$1.0 billion (Rs 10.0 billion) mark for the first time in 1982 and
increased further to Rs 17.6 billion in 1984. These assets were financed by
rupee borrowings (58%), foreign currency borrowings (29%), other liabilities
(5X), and net worth (8%). The rapid growth in assets since 1981 was due to the
improvement in the investment climate, as a result of initial liberalization
steps by GOP in the industrial sector and the recovery of the world economy and
internal demand. ICICI efforts to diversify and promote business was also
relevant, as witnessed by the start of leasing operations and the diversification
of both foreign and rupee resources.
21.     In 1984, IBRD loans outstanding accounted for 53% of foreign currency
loans, down from 85% at the end of 1978. In fact, since 1980 ICICI has been
quite active in raising foreign currency resources from the international capital
markets, partly at the prompting of the Bank. Up until 1983, ICICI had obtained
four Eurocurrency loans from banking consortia and one direct loan from a
European bank, aggregating US$62 million, DM 95 million, SF 40 million and
JY 3,000 million (para. 15). In addition, since 1981 KfW has granted loans to
ICICI totaling DM 90 million. Rupee borrowings by way of debentures and bonds
have also increased substantially. In the period 1979-1983, bonds and debentures
issued totaled Rs 3,720 million. These large borrowings, however, have not
affected adversely the Corporation's debt equity ratio, which was actually
reduced from a high of 10.5 to 1 in 1981 to 9.8 to 1 in 1984, because of ICICI's
earning capability, its policy of substantial reinvestment of profits, and
increase in share capital in 1984. The Corporation's liquidity position and its
debt service capability have also remained satisfactory.
22.     Arrears Position.  Annex 5 shows the trend in ICICI's arrears from
1978-1984. Annex 6 shows an analysis of arrears as of December 31, 1984. Total
arrears increased from Rs 129 million in 1978 to Rs 366 million in 1984.
However, as a percent of its total portfolio, its total arrears declined to 2.4%
in 1984 from a high of 3.8% in 1980; likewise, the principal outstanding of



-9-
companies in arrears as a percent of total portfolio was down to 11.7% in 1984
from a high of 20.1% in 1980. The number of companies in arrears increased from
156 in 1978 to 241 in 1984 although this was maintained at 11% of total client
companies.  ICICI has been able to contain its arrears through reasonably high
collections (73% of total dues in 1984) and regular supervision and rescheduling.
ICICI has also managed to achieve an adequate debt service coverage (average
about 1.3 times). ICICI's portfolio remains basically sound; ICICI has also
built an adequate equity base and accumulated reserves which amounted to almost 4
times its arrears at end of 1984. There are, however, some aspects which would
need greater attention by ICICI. At the end of 1984, there were 99 companies
facing severe difficulties, These hard-core cases accounted for 61% of total
arrears. In 1984, ICICI rescheduled Rs 350 million, or 13% of the total amounts
due. However, there were still 92 companies with loans rescheduled (Rs 597
million) which were still in arrears; these had outstanding loans of Rs 858
million or 6% of total portfolio. Part of the arrears problem has been due to
projects financed under consortium financing in which ICICI is not the lead
institution. While recovery of difficult cases is coordinated by all members of
a consortium and joint periodic reviews are made of common arrears, ICICI has
less flexibility and more limited control on the speed with which recovery deci-
sions are taken in consortium projects. Some arrangement may have to be made
to speed up recovery including ICICI taking a lead role in problem project
analysis and/or restructuring. Another aspect is the adequacy of experienced
staff to handle a growing number of problem projects. One option is to utilize
outside consultants as the need arises; ICICI has on occasion engaged these
services for this purpose.
IV. LOAN UTILIZATION/PROJECTS FINANCED
23.     Actual Utilization and Disbursements.  Both loans were committed and
disbursed very much as anticipated. Loan 1097-IN was fully committed by
December 1977 and disbursements completed by 1981. Similarly, Loan 1475-IN was
fully committed by December 1980 and fully disbursed by 1983. Final amounts
disbursed were US$93.8 million and US$79.0 million, respectively. The subloans
under both loans are broken down as followsS
Number of Subloans        Amount Disbursed
(US$ 'million-
Above Free Limit:
Loan 1097-IN                   2                          8.971
Loan 1475-IN                   2                          9.830
Below Free Limit:
Loan 1097-IN                 233                         84.836
Loan 1475-IN                 159                         66.181
Total                    396                        169.818
Annex 7 shows a detailed breakdown by size of loan.  The average loan size was
about US$429,000. Above free-limit ioans were 11% of the total disbursements and
about one-third was for loans between US$1.0 - US$2.0 million. However, 213



-10-
subloans (54%) were less than US$250,000, though the amount of such loans was
only 10% of the total. Due to cancellations, about 95% was disbursed which is
considered normal, but slightly higher than the two previous Bank Loans (92%).
The Bank loans (Rs 1.936 million) accounted for about 78% of total ICICI assis-
tance with rupee loans (Rs 400 million) and underwriting/direct subscriptions
(Rs 129 million) representing 16% and 6% respectively.
24.     Subsector Distribution.  Under both Loans, about one-third (Rs 554
million) of the subloans went to chemical and petroleum products (Annexes 8 and
9). The textile sector was a major recipient accounting for 15% (Rs 291 million)
of subloans in each Bank loan. Two subsectors, basic metal and fabricated metal
products/machinery manufacturing, accounted for 12% (Rs 238 million) and 10%
(Rs 210 million) of the subloans, respectively. Of the total subloans (Re 1,936
million) 67% went to the above four subsectors. Under the Eleventh Loan, ship-
ping was provided Rs 22 million or 5%. Other subsectors financed included elec-
trical machinery (8%), automotive ancillaries (6%), rubber/rubber products (5%)
and mining (4%).
25.     Location and Type of Projects.  Of the total 396 projects, 84 projects
(21%) were located in backward areas; these received Rs 586 million, or 30% of
the total disbursements under the Eleventh and Twelfth Loan. The performance in
this regard compares favorably with the experience under the two previous Bank
Loans (Loans 789 and 902), where 16% of the projects were in backward areas and
accounted for 20% of total disbursements. Thus, ICICI achieved its objective of
promoting more projects in the backward areas. By the type of projects, the
experience was as follows:
Tne                      Number                      Amount (Rs Million)
Loan 1097   Loan 1475   Total   Loan 1097   Loan 1475   Total
New                 30           23          53         156        138        294
Diversification    24            20          44         166        227        393
Expansion           62           45         107        444         296        740
Modernization       31           19          50         157        135        292
Balancing/
Replacement       88           54         142        112         105        217
Total        235           161        396       1,035         901      1,936
In line with ICICI's priorities (para. 13), modernization and
balancing/replacement projects (192) accounted for 48% of total projects.
However, new projects accounted for 13% by number and 15% by amount compared to
15% by number (60) and 25% by amount (Rs 359 million) under the two previous Bank
Loans. By amount, expansion and diversification projects continued to have a
substantial share of 58% of total loans.
26.     Time and Cost Overrun.  Based on data for 350 projects, 189 projects
(54%) were implemented on schedule which is a substantial improvement over tho v
in the previous Loans, i.e. 92 projects (27%) out of 333 projects. Projects with
delays of over 12 months were fewer, i.e. 55 projects (15%) compared to
90 projects (27%) in previous Loans. Only 102 projects (29X) experienced cost



-11-
overruns versus 150 projects (48%) in previous loaas.  The aggregate overrun of
actual over estimated cost for 350 projects was 10.8%. However, for the projects
with cost overrun, the overrun was 23.8% of estimated costs; there were only
29 projects with overrun over 20% of estimated costs compared to 56 projects in
previous loans. Overall, project implementation under Loans 1097 and 1475 has
been satisfactory and much better than the two previous Bank Loans. The major
delays were in arranging project finances including equity contribution, delivery
of equipment, government licenses, shortage of power, and modification of
design/location during implementation. In addition to delays in implementation,
cost overrun were due mainly to increases in excise and customs 4uties, price
increase of steel and cement, and changes in project location and scope/design.
27.     Financial Performance.  Based on available data for 81 companies, only
eight companies showed net losses and 41 companies (51%) showed profits higher
than estimated. Average return on investment was 18% which is adequate. Actual
capacity utilization (45 projects) averaged 75% ranging from 21% to 160%. Three
companies with losses had capacity utilization of less than 35%. Repayment
experience of Bank financed projects has been satisfactory and better than
ICICI's overall portfolio. Out of the 396 projects, 164 subloans have been fully
repaid and repayrments of 52 cases were rescheduled. As of September 30, 1984,
the outstanding loan balances were US$37.3 million, or 40% of Loan 1097-IN and
US$49.1 million, or 65% of total disbursements for Loan 1475-IN.  Total arrears
from 13 companies (5%) amounted to Rs 8.3 million or 0.1% of outstanding amount.
The arrears were due to poor performance arising mainly from inadequate
management, power shortages, technical problems leading to low capacity utiliza-
tion and labor problems. In many cases, ICICI has arranged the merger or pur-
chase by larger, more efficient companies to rehabilitate these projects.
28.     Economic Indicators.  The actual average economic rate of return (ERR)
for a sample of 16 subprojects was 25%, which is satisfactory, ranging from 7% to
50%; four projects showed ERRs of below 7-8% compared to expected ERRs of 11%
and above. Six out of ten subprojects had actual ERRs higher than expected. A
sample of 15 projects showed exports averaging 9% of sales with one company
exporting as high as 34% of sales. Results of an ICICI study lt of export per-
formance of ICICI-financed projects indicated the following: [a) exports as
percent of sales declined to 9% in 1981 from 12% in 1979 due to the larger growth
in domestic sales; (b) companies with more than 10% exports decreased from 32 in
1979 to 20 in 1981; (c) in general, profitability of domestic sales remained
t higher than exports; (d) there was an increasing number where exports had become
profitable, although in the majority of the sample, export profitability remained
negative despite the export incentives; and (e) in general, exports were not
competitive in price due mainly to prices of local raw materials and less liberal
credit facilities. To help address the disappointing export performance, ICICI
would be implementing the Bank's proposed Industrial Export Development Project.
Data on actuai employment in 28 companies was estimated at 12,900 workers at a
cost per job of about Rs 400,000 or US$32,000 which is still reasonably low given
the type of projects and size of enterprises financed (para. 25).
1/ Sample of 90 companies of which 81 were exporting; share of the sample to
India's total exports was about 32% (1978-1981)

V. CONCLUSIONS
29.     Since the two projects under review were first appraised, ICICI has
developed well. It has expanded and diversified its operations. It has made
important resource mobilization efforts, both domestically and in international
markets. Its present activities go beyond the simple transfer of funds to
industry and encompass support in developing skilled labor, carrying out
industrial research, promoting project development, and several other development
activities. This has been achieved by continuity and dynamism in management, and
dedication and capacity on the part of staff. The profits attained by the
Corporation have been consistently satisfactory and its financial condition is
sound. It is not surprising, then, that ICICI was able to execute the two
projects with good results and the achievement of positive developmental impact.
ICICI is successful in adapting its operations to changes and constraints in the
financial and industrial environment and thereby promote efficient and profitable
operations. At the same time, ICICI with Bank support and assistance, is
developing new initiatives particularly in policy oriented sector work. For
example, ICICI's sector work served as basis and has led to the formulation of
the Bank's Industrial Export Development Project and the proposed Cement Project,
which are expected to be present to the Executive Directors in FY86.
30.     However, an area that is of some concern to the Bank relates to an
incipient rise in the overall level of arrears, particularly in respect of loans
under consortium arrangements. ICICI's management is fully conscious of the
potential problems in this area and is acting to minimize them by expanding its
independent operations, subjecting consortia operations to harder scrutiny at
appraisal, and maintaining close contact with the consortium leader during
implementation, supervision and collection for early detection of problems in
these projects. It is important to address these arrears, particularly in com-
panies whose loans have been rescheduled but remain in arrears with ICICI which
indicate more serious problems. ICICI needs to be cautious in reschedulings
since these adversely affect its debt service capacity and could represent an
under assessment of collection problems.

Chairman & Managing Director                                 November 30, 1985
Mr. Yukinosi Watanabe
Director
Operations Evaluation Department

1818 H. Street, NW

U. S. A.
Dear Mr. Watanabe:
Project Completion Report -
ICICI - Loans 1097 & 1475 IN
I acknowledge with thanks, receipt of your letter dated
October 22, 1985, enclosing a copy of the draft completion report
prepared by your Operating Staff in respect of the captioned loans.
We have gone through the draft completion report and appreciate
the detailed analysis of ICICI's activities, including institutional
aspects, financing strategy, operational results, development role
besides review of projects financed under the captioned loans.
Whil the draft completion report appears to us as a well balanced
document providing your analysis of ICICI's activities and overall
conclusions, we would like to offer our comments on a few observa-
tions made in the draft completion report.
In para 8 of the draft cornpletion report, a reference    /reflected in
is made about ICICI's financing of marpinal projects led by other      para 8.
members of the consortium. We wish to clarify that, ICICI commits
itself to financing of projects only after it is satisfied regarding
long-term viability of the projects assisted. With regard to foreign
exchange resources for industrial enterprises, while ICICI continues
to be the major source of foreign exchange funds, other financial
institutions have also recently augmented their foreign exchange
resources by raising the funds in European and Japanese capital
markets.

In the same para, it is mentioned that the maximum   /para. 8
size of the loan a financial institution can commit is Rs 30 million    corrected
to any one enterprise. In this connection, we would like to clarify
that it is the general policy of the financial institutions to restrict
their exposure iI an enterprise to a prudent level in each case;
however, there is no statutory limit on financing an enterprise
beyond Rs 30 million.
In para 22 of the completion report, you have commented   /initially
on ICICI's Arrears position which shows increase in absolute terms    stated in
from  Rs 129 million in 1978 to Rs 366 million in 1984.  Howesver,   para. 22
this may be viewed in relation to the total outstandings of the
loan portfolio which increased from Rs 4,105 million in 1978 to
Rs 15,265 million in 1984. However, as you have rightly observed,
total arrears have declined to 2.4% of outstanding loans in 1984
from a high of 3.8% in 1980 and principal outstanding of companies
in arrears as a percentage of total portfolio declined to 11.7%
in 194 from 20.1% in 1980.
As regards arrears in respect of uni is in which ICICI   /reflected in
is not the lead institution, we may mention the problems of the    para. 22
units are discussed at various institutional forums and proposals
for recovery are finalised after examining various aspects. Recovery
of loans is considered as an important function, and a co-ordinated
approach is followed by all financial institutions.  Timely recovery
of loan amounts has assumed importance in the context of increase
in volume cf operations of the financial institutions, and need
for revolving funds for financing new projects. Recently, institutions
have started intensive review of arrears of assisted units located
in different regions by Regional Committees. These reviews would
highlight the problems like, shortage of power, raw materials,
labour, transport bottlenecks, etc., as also specific problems faced
by different units in the region.  These reviews would enable the
institutions to take co-ordinated approach in taking up the issues
at apjpropriate levels to solve the problems of various units which
wouldlead to the improvement in operations and recovery of the
outstanding amounts.

We may mention, that ICICI is quite aware of the problems   /reflected ii
of recovery and is exerting itself for containing arrears. Towards    para. 30
this end, it has been maintaining close contact with the lead insti-
tution. ICICI has been participating in joint inspection programmes
and subsequent discussions on review of operations and steps to
be taken for recovery of overdues. We agree with your observation
that ICICI needs to be cautious in rescheduling as this may affect
its debt service capacity and could represent an under assessment
of the collection problems.
You have referred to increase in number of hard core
cases from  43 at the end of 1982 to 99 at the end of 1984.  In   /corrected
this connection, you may kindly refer to the Dossier prepared by    and
us for IBRD Mission (Annex 28) in March 1983, in which we have      reflected it
indicated that the hard core cases at the end of December 31,    para. 12
1982, were 98 and not 43 as mentioned in the Draft Completion       and para. 2;
Report.  Rehabilitation Departmernt, which carries out intensive
monitoring of hard core cases, is looked after by experienced persons,
including a Deputy General Manager, Assistant General Manager,
Chief, 5 officers and two other staff members.  While ICICI has
over the years gained considerable experience in handling problem
projects, services of outside consultants are utilised in appropriate
cases.  ICICI has, in the past, engaged consultants not only for
critical study of problems and suggest remedies, but also for laying
down detailed management information and costing systems.  We
propose to continue obtaining services of outside consulstants to
supplement our efforts in the rehabilitation programmes.
We would like to express out thanks to the staff of
the Bank for end-use evaluation of the l1th and 12th Lines of
Credit and the continued support to the ICICI's Operations.
With kind regards,
Yours sincerely,
N. VAGHUL
