INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVEST-
MENT CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF INDIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited (ICICI)
with the guarantee of India for the equivalent of US$100 million to help
finance ICICI's operations through June 1977. The terms of the loan would
be an interest rate of 8-1/2% per annum and repayment according to the
amortization schedule of sub-projects up to a maximum of 18 years, including
3 years of grace.
PART I - TIIE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(402-IN dated May 7, 1974) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 20, 1974. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size, diversity, and the difficulty of its economic conditions. India's
economic policies and performance have their shortcomings, many of which are
attributable to the open political system, where the reconciliation of con-
flicting political views tends to inhibit optimal economic solutions; others
are due to the sheer magnitude of the task facing the Government. Governing
a country divided into more than 20 States with a population of some 580
million and over 60 languages is an extraordinary responsibility. The
country's poverty and poor natural resource endowment, supplemented by a
net transfer of external resources averaging in recent years well below
US$1 per head per annum, have imposed sharp limitations on the rate of
growth. Any judgment of India's economic performance must take these under-
lying circumstances into account. So, also, must account be taken of the
uncertainties imposed by the erratic availability of water. A bad monsoon,
which is inevitable from time to time, has a pervasive influence over the
entire economy and wipes out the results of years of effort.
4.        In the past 25 years, national income has grown at nearly 4 per-
cent per annum, which compares very favorably with the average annual growth
rate of less than 1 percent during the preceding 50 years. Population has
also grown faster in the past two decades than previously, but per capita
income has nevertheless risen from a more or less stagnant level in the first
half of this century to achieve an average growth of roughly 1 percent a
year since independence.
5.        Progress has been impressive on many fronts, but disappointing on
others and has all too often fallen short of India's massive needs. The
growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport, education, health



-2-
services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been achieved at high
cost and has yielded results of variable quality. Many industrial and agri-
cultural investment schemes have been highly successful, but others have
taken excessively long to be completed and have operated well below full
capacity. In some regions of the country growth and structural change have
been rapid and compare favorably with developments in many other parts of
the world, but in other regions there has been stagnation and possibly even
decline. Despite these improvements and although the distribution of income
in India is relatively even by comparison with many other countries, there
has been little impact upon the living standards of the vast masses of the
urban and rural population. The Government has become increasingly concerned
about the plight of the lower income strata, which - conservatively measured -
consist of some 200 million people with incomes of less than US$60 per head
per year, and has initiated in recent years a variety of programs specifically
designed to alleviate poverty.
6.        The structure of the economy has been slow to change.   Agriculture
remains the dominant sector, accounting for some 43 percent of national pro-
duct in the early 1970s compared with around 49 percent twenty years pre-
viously. The share of output contributed by the industrial sector has in-
creased only slowly and since the late 1960s has remained approximately
constant at a level of 23 percent. There has, however, been a shift in the
composition of industrial production, with consumer, intermediate, and capital
goods now contributing about one-third each, compared with an overwhelming
preponderance of consumer goods production 25 years ago.
?.        The economic report of May 1974 contained a review of the immense
difficulties confronting the Indian economy as the Fourth Plan period drew
to a close. The final year of the Plan, 1973/74, witnessed a severe deterio-
ration in India's terms of trade which was led by, but by no means restricted
to, the dramatic increase in oil prices. The resulting balance of payments
difficulties were compounded by the need for food imports following the
drought of 1972/73, in order to sustain the public distribution system on
which the poorest section of society is particularly dependent. Given India's
pervasively agricultural economy, the drought also had the effect of causing
a general slow-down in economic activity which was further aggravated by in-
frastructure constraints, particularly widespread power shortages and labor
problems of Indian Railways. Food shortages and other scarcities touched
off an unprecedented inflationary spiral fueled by large budgetary deficits
which were at least partly attributable to mounting expenditures for drought
relief. The inflation in turn contributed to labor unrest while efforts to
cope with it through budgetary cuts affected, among other things, the level
of real expenditures for development programs.
8.        Thus, at the commencement of the Fifth Plan period (1974/75-1978/79)
the most urgent tasks facing policy makers were: to get agricultural pro-
duction moving again; to bring inflation under control; to reduce India's
dependence on oil imports by compressing energy consumption and by formulating
and implementing programs to develop domestic energy sources; to boost export
earnings and to tap additional sources of aid in order to sustain imports;



- 3 -
and, finally, to maintain a minimum investment program so as to avoid economic
standstill in the longer run. Even in the best of times, it would have been
extremely difficult to pursue simultaneously such a variety of potentially
inconsistent objectives.
9.        Events since the preparation of the last economic report provide
little encouragement. For the second time in the last three years, the
weather has let down India's farmers with the result that the kharif (fall)
crop harvested towards the end of 1974 is believed to be considerably below
the previous year's (about 60 million tons as compared with 67 million tons).
The outlook for the present rabi (spring) crop is quite encouraging despite
continuing shortages of power for irrigation pumps and fertilizer shortages.
However, the reduced availability of foodgrains and the depletion of official
food stocks during the course of 1974, the inflationary setting and frequent
changes in the Government's food procurement policy have led to hoarding for
both speculative and insurance purposes, thus making procurement for distrib-
ution through Government shops extremely difficult.
10.       The balance of payments situation is likely to remain difficult
in the current year as there will be a continued need for foodgrain imports,
hopefully at a somewhat lower level than the 6-7 million tons required
last year, and because there is little evidence of a major break in the
prices of other commodities imported in substantial quantities by India (e.g.
oil, fertilizers, steel, rock phosphate). One of the few bright spots in
the balance of payments picture has been the growth of export earnings.
Export earnings recorded an unprecedented increase of 22% in 1973/74 and
are expected to rise again by 29% in 1974/75. While these increases -
particularly that in 1973/74 - are primarily attributable to unit value
increases caused by worldwide inflation, there is greater willingness to
take advantage of export opportunities, as illustrated most dramatically by
the recent diversion of sugar from domestic consumption to exports.
11.       Nevertheless, despite the increase in export earnings, India is
expected to run a massive trade deficit in 1974/75 - probably of the order
of US$1,800 million as compared with US$560 million in 1973/74 and a negli-
gible one the previous year. Moreover, despite the magnitude of the current
deficit, it is unlikely that India's imports, excluding foodgrains, will be
as large in volume as in 1972/73. In addition to financing a trade deficit
of this order, India will have to meet debt service payments of about US$730
million. These financing requirements will be partly offset through Con-
sortium assistance and Non-Consortium aid (including assistance from oil
producing countries), which are together expected to reach disbursement
levels of about US$1,750 million in 1974/75 compared with about US$1,175
million in 1973/74. Nevertheless, these various sources of financing fall
short of India's current requirements. India will have to draw on her
foreign exchange reserves, which, at about US$1,400 million, are currently
equivalent to less than three months of imports. During Fiscal Year 1974/75,
India has drawn down her First Credit Tranche in the IMF for $282 million,
as well as her Gold Tranche for $91 million. The Government has also taken
advantage of the Oil Facility, from which $240 million was drawn in October.



- 4 -
12.       On the domestic front, the Government's present efforts are con-
centrated primarily on maximizing production in key sectors through a system
of priorities in the allocation of scarce resources and through careful
monitoring of developments and performance. In agriculture this entails
provision of power on a priority basis for minor irrigation and fertilizer
production and allocation of adequate foreign exchange for as much fertilizer
as can be imported from the limited world supplies. Similarly, efforts are
being made to identify production bottlenecks in such sectors as fertilizer
production, coal mining and power generation; and special arrangements exist
for meeting expeditiously the foreign exchange requirements of these sectors
for such items as captive power units where appropriate, spares and replace-
ment parts. The railways are also tied into this system and accord priority
to the movement of goods required by these sectors. In the fertilizer, coal
and power sectors, senior officials are provided on a continuing basis with
detailed production figures along with explanations for production shortfalls.
Attempts are also being made to rationalize the administrative machinery of
the Government in these sectors, as evidenced by the October 1974 decision
to bring irrigation under the wing of the Food and Agriculture Ministry
and to regroup power generation and coal mining under an Energy Ministry.
13.       The recent discovery of new oil reserves offshore in the Bombay
High structure has considerably improved prospects for domestic oil production,
which presently accounts for about 7 to 8 million tons or one third of India's
consumption. It is still too early to give a firm estimate of the overall
level of extractable reserves concentrated there, but it is possible that in
the early 1980s output from this field could double the present domestic
production. So, even after allowing for some increase in demand, it is pos-
sible that Bombay High production could reduce India's future oil import
needs considerably. However, the feasibility of the program to extract Bombay
High oil will depend upon the availability of expertise, finance and equipment,
and while the Government of India may be able to overcome the first two
constraints, the international scarcity of offshore oil extraction equipment
may delay exploitation.
14.       In the short term, however, there are limits to the extent to which
India's dependence on oil imports can be reduced and production of domestic
sources of energy can be stepped up. Insofar as the compression of demand
for oil products is concerned, these limits are determined, on the one hand,
by the relatively small proportion of oil products used for private con-
sumption (possibly one-sixth) and, on the other hand, by the limited avail-
ability of domestic substitutes (i.e. coal and power). The 13 million tons
of crude oil plus 3 million tons of product imports planned for 1974/75
probably represent the lower limit beyond which these imports cannot be
curbed without serious repercussions on domestic production. Had consumption
been allowed to grow in line with recent trends, the present level of crude
and product imports taken together would probably be of the order of at least
18 million tons.



- 5 -
15.       A major effort is being made to use existing capacity as fully as
possible throughout the economy. To this end, despite the serious balance
of payments problem described above, the Government is pursuing a relatively
liberal policy toward imports of raw materials required by industry. Never-
theless, it is hard to get away from the current infrastructure constraints
and particularly the shortage and unreliability of power supplies which,
though somewhat eased, continue to affect production. Fiscal and monetary
policies, including the cutback in budgetary expenditures and limitations
on bank credit, are also restraining industrial output; and there is some
evidence that, due to rapidly rising food prices and the consequent erosion
of real purchasing power, the demand for some consumer items and industrial
products is being affected. Given the various constraints, there was little
industrial growth during 1974 which, in combination with the current agri-
cultural situation, makes it unlikely that there will have been any GNP
growth either.  In regard to inflation, the Government has made impressive
efforts to curb budgetary expenditures and to tap additional sources of
revenue. In spite of continuing food shortages and other scarcities, these
actions appear now to have achieved some results as the rate of inflation
had declined from an annual rate of 30%, which was being experienced in mid
1974, to 23% by the end of November 1974.
16.       In present circumstances the Draft Fifth Plan, published in late
1973, has not been finalized. In real terms investment in the current Annual
Plan is about 30% below the annual level implicit in the Draft Fifth Plan,
and even this is unlikely to be reached. To adjust to reduced resource
availability a number of investments are being postponed. Expenditures on
some of the social sectors such as education and family planning are un-
fortunately also affected. The focus once again is primarily on investments
in key sectors such as fertilizer, coal, power, and steel, and quite rightly
within these sectors the emphasis is on completing ongoing investments
before committing resources to new schemes.
17.       In the long run, given her groundwater, coal, hydroelectric, iron
ore, non-ferrous metals and human resources, India undoubtedly has the
capability to overcome her present difficulties. It is, however, clear that
to overcome them and to resume the interrupted process of economic develop-
ment, India will require substantially larger capital inflows than foreseen
by the authors of the Draft Fifth Plan. It is equally clear that as large
as possible a proportion of these requirements should be provided on con-
cessional terms. However, even on very optimistic assumptions regarding
India's success in narrowing her resource gap and the response of both
Consortium and other donors, a gap will remain between external financing
requirements and the availability of concessional aid.
18.       India's external public debt outstanding on March 31, 1973, stood
at US$9.9 billion. As a consequence of world-wide inflation and its effects
on India's export earnings, service payments of about US$730 million due
on this debt in 1974/75 are expected to be equivalent to about 17% of merchan-
dise exports as compared with about 26% in 1972/73. However, substantial
additional debt will have to be incurred as a result of increases in the



- 6 -
prices of India's imports. In the future, therefore, the debt service ratio
is likely to rise, given the magnitude of India's requirements and the un-
avoidability of having to finance part of these on non-concessional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
19.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 43 loans and 67 development
credits to India totalling US$1,338 million and US$3,050 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$674 million has been
repaid, and US$1,273 million was still undisbursed as of January 31. 1975.
Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements as of January 31, 1975,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.       Since 1957, IFC has made 14 commitments in India totalling US$51.8
million, of which US$7.6 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$30.3 million, US$23.3 mil-
lion represents loans and US$7.1 million equity. A summary statement of
IFC operations as of January 31, 1975, is also included in Annex II (page 2).
21.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting minor
irrigation and other on farm investments through agricultural credit operations.
Major irrigation, marketing, and seed development are other agricultural
aptivities supported by the Bank Group. In recognition of the importance of
adequate fertilizer supplies for agricultural output, the Bank Group has been
active in financing the expansion of fertilizer production. Apart from
investments in fertilizer plants, the Bank Group has lent support to the in-
dustrial sector through its sizeable assistance to development finance
institutions, in particular ICICI. IDA financing of industrial raw materials
and components for selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facl-
itating better capacity utilization in these sectors. The Bank Group has
also been active in supporting infrastructure development for power, tele-
communications and railways. Family planning, education, water supply
development and related urban investments have also received Bank Group
support in recent years.
22.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, and transport remains highly
relevant. The priority of the agricultural sector has been further enhanced
in the present world commodity situation. Thus, projects designed to foster
agricultural production through the provision of essential inputq such as
credit for on-farm investments, command area development of existing irriga-
tion schemes, fertilizer and seeds form an important aspect of the Bank
Group's program for the next years. Special emphasis will be given to
projects designed to increase the productivity of small farmers and landless
laborers. Lending in support of infrastructure and industrial investments



will focus on energy-related projects. Repeater credits for power and rail-
ways have high priority in this context, and discussions are under way with
the Government in an effort to identify and prepare projects specifically
designed to facilitate coal production and coal transport. Lending for
fertilizer projects, which has been an important feature in recent years,
is expected to continue to occupy a prominent place in the future program.
23.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic reports
and of the discussions within the India Consortium. The need for readily
usable foreign exchange assistance is especially pressing at a time when
output and investment have to be adjusted to a radically different price
situation. Consequently, Bank Group lending for critical industrial raw
materials and components continues to be an essential element within the
overall program of assistance. As in the past, Bank Group assistance for
projects in India should include, as appropriate, the financing of local
expenditures. India imports relatively few capital goods because of the
capacity of the domestic capital goods industry. The import component of
projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas as agricul-
ture, education, and family planning. For the Bank Group to be able to make
an appropriate contribution to the financing of projects in these sectors,
it is important to cover a proportion of local expenditures.
24.       As mentioned in the foregoing discussion of the Indian economy, as
much as possible of India's external capital requirements should be provided
on concessionary terms. Accordingly, the bulk of the Bank Group's assistance
to India has been, and should continue to be, provided from IDA. However,
the amount of IDA funds that can reasonably be allocated to India remains
small in relation to India's need for external assistance, and some Bank
lending to India is appropriate. In recent years the Bank has been lending
to India at the rate of some $50 million a year with the result that the
amount of outstanding and disbursed loans to India has been stabilized at
something less than $600 million ($565 million as of January 31, 1975, as
comfpared to the peak figure of $613 million reached in 1970). As mentioned
in paragraph 18 above, India's debt service ratio has recently dropped con-
siderably, as a consequence of inflation, from about 26 percent in 1972/73
to 17 percent in 1974/75; on the other hand, this ratio is expected to rise
in the future as India begins to service the increased level of debt which
it has recently been undertaking. In these circumstances, and in view of
the special requirements of India as one of the countries most seriously
affected by recent commodity developments, I believe it is appropriate, and
within a reasonable judgment of India's creditworthiness, to increase the
rate of Bank lending to India this year, although I think our longer-term
policy toward lending to India should be held in abeyance pending further
appraisal of India's rapidly evolving situation. The present loan, together
with the $109 million loan to IFFCO approved on January 7, 1975, would raise
total lending to India in the present fiscal year to $209 million. Assuming
no Bank lending to India in future years in excess of the $50 million level,
this would raise India's outstanding and disbursed debt to the Bank to a
peak of between $600 and $650 million in 1981.



- 8 -
25.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70 the Bank Group
accounted for 34 percent of total commitments, 13 percent of gross disburse-
ments, and 12 percent of net disbursements as compared with an estimated
35 percent, 27 percent and 37 percent, respectively, in 1973/74, and the
contribution of the Bank Group is expected to continue growing. Whereas on
March 31, 1973, the Bank Group share of India's outstanding external public
debt was 21 percent, by 1979 it is projected to account for about 25 percent.
Because Bank Group assistance to India is predominantly in the form of IDA
credits, debt service to the Bank Group will rise slowly. In 1973/74 about
12 percent of India's total debt service payments were to the Bank Group.
PART III - INDUSTRY
26.       Over the past two decades the Government of India (GOI) followed
a policy of vigorous import substitution which gave rise to quite a rapid
growth of industrial output of about 9% per annum during the late 1950's
and the first half of the 1960's. As a consequence by the middle 1960's
India had developed an industrial structure capable of producing a wide
diversity of goods, including highly sophisticated items. However, since
1966 the record of industrial growth has been disappointing, having aver-
aged less than 4% in the seven years through.1972. More recently, the
record has been even more disappointing with a growth in output of less
than 1% in 1973 and the expectation that there was little, if any, more
in 1974.
27.       The reason for the poor record of recent years is complex, but
undoubtedly important factors have been the overall stagnation of the eco-
nomy, the inadequacy of vital inputs, and the economic and social environ-
ment. The drought induced periods of stagnation over 1965-67 and over the
past three years have had such a severe impact on the economy that the
average rate of growth for the economy from 1965/66 to 1972/73 has been
just under 2.5%. This stagnation set in just after the potential for
import substitution had been largely exploited, thus there was no other
internal stimulus to industrial activity. Exports could, of course, have
provided some stimulus but until very recently export development has been
given inadequate attention.
28.       The inadequacy of vital inputs arises from the acute shortage of
foreign exchange for imported raw materials and the variability in the out-
put of domestic agricultural raw materials upon which about 40% of industrial
activity is dependent. In addition, over the past two years industry has
been plagued by chronic shortages of power and has had to contend with often
inadequate rail and road facilities. Finally, the many social and political
objectives which in addition to the prevailing shortages have led the Govern-
ment to rely on a system of controls for the industrial sector that easily
comes into conflict with the need to exploit more fully India's growth poten-
tial and comparative advantage.



- 9 -
29.       There are three main elements of industrial policy administration,
industrial licensing, price controls, and import licensing. In February
1973, the Government made an announcement which re-confirmed the areas for
private and public sector activity and clarified the criteria for expansion
by large industrial houses and investment by foreign corporations. The
Government also said that a single secretariat would be set up to stream-
line administrative procedures for the granting of industrial licenses.
This announcement was well received by the private sector at the time, and
since then there is a clear consensus that administrative arrangements have
improved under the new Secretariat for Industrial Approvals. Steps have
also been taken to remove price controls which had had a deleterious effect
upon a number of industries. By the end of 1974, the prices of a wide range
of industrial raw materials and manufactured goods had been decontrolled.
Measures have also been taken to simplify import licensing and to improve
the administration of the export incentive schemes.
30.       The changes in the administration of industrial policy have
induced a much more favorable climate for investment. Indeed, despite
the depressed state of the economy, there are indications that industrial
investment in 1974 and intentions for 1975 will at least maintain the 1973
level of activity. However, the distribution of this investment is likely
to show a shift towards the high priority sectors of electrical equipment,
agricultural machinery, fertilizer, transportation and machine tools. Fur-
ther, evidence of sustained investment interest is the rising demand for
assistance from the principal financial institutions, including ICICI.
31.       Underutilization of capacity is prevalent in the industrial sector
and the reasons are complex and vary from industry to industry and, indeed,
from firm to firm. In general, the domestic supply and demand situation as
well as the shortage of imported raw materials have been important factors.
The improvement of utilization has been given priority by the Government and
aid donors are also helping by providing foreign exchange in non-project form.
Notwithstanding the need to increase output from existing plants, there is
also a need to promote the restructuring of industry to make it competitive
and responsive to the high priority requirements of the economy. For this
purpose new investment is required to modernize and balance existing plants,
to expand capacity where there are constraints, and to develop export-oriented
industries.
Industrial Financing
32.       The industrial sector is served by a number of financial institu-
tions. The Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the Industrial Finance
Corporation of India (IFCI), and ICICI, the beneficiary of the proposed loan,
operate on a large scale throughout India. At state level, there are State
Financial Corporations (SFCs) and State Industrial Development Corporations
(SIDCs). The national institutions are primarily engaged in term lending.
Their assistance has been directed mainly to medium and large scale enter-
prises, primarily in the private and joint sectors.



- 10 -
33.       IDBI is the most important source of institutional industrial
finance. It provides funds both directly to industrial enterprises and in-
directly through refinancing SFCs and commercLal banks. Its activities
include granting loans, rediscounting commercial bills, providing export
financing and underwriting and guarantee operations. In January 1973, IDA
extended a credit of US$25 million to IDBI in order to meet the foreign ex-
change cost of SFC-financed projects and thereby to assist the small scale
sector. Utilization of this credit had a slow start, but commitments for
sub-projects are now gaining momentum (US$4.7 million as of February 28,
1975) and disbursements have begun.
34.       IFCI, which is owned by IDBI and other financial institutions,
also provides Rupee and, to some extent, foreign currency loans. Its
emphasis lies on financing cooperatives, particularly in the traditional
sub-sectors such as sugar and cotton. Commercial banks, the Life Insurance
Corporation of India (LIC), and the Unit Trust of India (UTI) also provide
long-term industrial finance. The latter two primarily underwrite new
issues and invest in industrial shares and debentures. The Industrial
Reconstruction Corporation of India (IRCI), originally established for
the State of West Bengal, is expanding beyond the State borders and pro-
vides both, managerial and financial assistance to "sick" enterprises.
The National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) has specialized on hire-
purchase financing for small scale industries.
35.       For industrial financing at the State level, the SFCs' role has
considerably increased over the last years. Total loans sanctioned by the
SFCs have increased sharply, reaching Rs 1,057 million in 1973/74 (38% in-
crease over 1972/73). The bulk of SFC assistance has been to the small-
scale sector. For the medium and large scale industries, the SIDCs are
more important and generally account for nearly 10% of all institutional
industrial financing. The SIDCs also engage in promotional activites.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       The Bank has been closely associated with ICICI since its founda-
tion in 1955. The proposed loan would be the Bank's eleventh to ICICI and
would bring the total amount of lending by the Bank to ICICI to US$426 mil-
lion (net of cancellations). It would help finance ICICI's projected for-
eign exchange requirements through June 1977.
37.       The project was appraised in July/August 1974.   A loan and proj-
ect summary is given in Annex III. A report entitled "India - Appraisal
of the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited",
dated March 14, 1975, Report - No. 637a-IN, is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were held in Washington from
February 20 to 26, 1975. The Borrower was represented by Mr. S.S. Mehta,
Managing Director, and Mr. S. Kumarasundaram, General Manager. The GOI as
guarantor has reviewed and approved the proposed legal documents.



Role, Ownership and Resources
38.       ICICI's role is to promote large and medium scale enterprises in
India, primarily in the non-traditional sectors of industry. It is the
principal source of foreign exchange for industrial projects in the private
sector. Ownership of ICICI is dominated by public sector corporations in-
cluding the Life Insurance Corporation of India, the Unit Trust of India,
and a number of commercial banks, which were nationalized in 1969. Of
ICICI's paid in share capital, which stood at Rs 150 million as of January
31, 1975, public institutions hold 71% of ICICI's capital. Foreign share-
holders, mainly banks, hold 18%. The balance of 11% is held by private
Indian investors.
39.       The Bank has been ICICI's most important source of funds.   Up
to the end of December 1974, the Bank had provided 46% of ICICI's total
outstanding resources and 83% of its foreign currency resources. Other
sources of foreign funds have been USAID, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
(KfW), the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the United Kingdom
and, in 1973, a Bond issue in Switzerland. ICICI has raised its rupee
funds through Government and IDBI borrowings, through share issues, internal
cash generation and more recently through a successful series of debentures.
In the future, ICICI plans to supplement the traditional local currency
sources by larger and more frequent debenture issues. In 1976 ICICI plans
to increase its share capital by an additional Rs 50 million. For foreign
currency, ICICI is keen to diversify its sources, a policy that the Bank
bas encouraged and entirely supports. Starting in 1975, ICICI expects to
be able to raise new foreign exchange resources in the Middle East in the
order of US$15-25 million at a reasonable cost. It is also exploring the
possibility of raising funds from the US Exim Bank.
Management and Board
40.       ICICI is well-managed and operates effectively.   Mr. H. T. Parekh
and Mr. S. S. Mehta continue to be Chairman and Managing Director respec-
tively. In April 1974, Dr. Medhora was appointed Joint Managing Director
and became a member of ICICI's Board of Directors. The Board now consists
of 16 directors, of whom five are private industrialists, three are from
public financial institutions, three represent foreign shareholders, two
represent the Government of India, and the remaining three are officers of
ICICI (Chairman, Managing Director, Joint Managing Director). Though ICICI
maintains close contact with GOI on industrial policy matters, it nonethe-
less retains its operational autonomy.
Operating Policies and Procedures
41.       ICICI's policy is to promote primarily large and medium scale
enterprises within the framework of the industrial policy set by the Govern-
ment. A major objective is to assist enterprises using newer technologies,
and in this ICICI has been successful. In addition, ICICI underwrites share
issues, particularly for new industrial enterprises, which would not otherwise
have been able to approach the capital market.



- 12 -
42.       At the Bank's suggestion, ICICI has prepared a statement outlining
its development strategies and financing priorities over the next few years
(see Annex 32 of the Appraisal Report). In line with GOI policies, emphasis
is being put on the development of high priority industries such as: coal,
power and transport; agricultural inputs and food processing; capital goods
industries for industrial expansion; mass consumption goods, which need to
be available in adequate quantity; and balancing and modernization programs.
The statement highlights in particular the priority of export-oriented in-
dustries and supporting activities and points out that ICICI-assisted projects
undergo systematic examination of their international competitiveness. In
order to obtain a deeper understanding of the basic problems facing exporters
and, at the same time, to indicate the contribution of ICICI clients to
India's exports and to analyze what ICICI itself has done and can do to
promote export activities, ICICI has undertaken to prepare a detailed study
of the problems and prospects for manufactured exports on the basis of a
sample survey of its clients. The results of this study would also be
of interest to the Bank, as they could form an appropriate platform to comment
sensibly on Indiats programs and progress in this vital area.
43.       ICICI's investigations into projects continue to be thorough and
sound. Technical, financial, management and market aspects are well covered.
Evaluation of the projects' economic contribution is adequate. ICICI was
among the first development finance companies associated with the Bank Group
to include an assessment of the economic rate of return in its appraisals.
Follow-up procedures and project supervision are satisfactory.
44.       ICICI's lending rates were increased in August 1974, against the
background of rising interest rates in India. The rate for Rupee Loans
is now 10-1/4% per annum, in line with IDBI's rate increase. Foreign cur-
rency rates rose to 10-1/2% per annum for ordinary loans and to 9-1/2% per
annum for concessionary loans to industries in backward areas. A commit-
ment fee of 1% per annum is levied on undisbursed loan amounts. The for-
eign exchange risk is passed on to the sub-borrowers, as previously. ICICI's
lending rates are in accord with the general interest rate structure in
India. In view of the Bank's recently increased lending rate, ICICI will
review its own lending rate for foreign currency loans by September 30, 1975.
45.       ICICI generally requires that its clients procure equipment on
the best terms. It insists on competitive quotations from three or more
manufacturers or suppliers of international standing. Bids are carefully
evaluated. Disbursement procedures are satisfactory. ICICI intends to
open its own letters of credit in order to provide faster service to its
clients.
Past Operations
46.       The sectoral distribution of operations continues to be wide.
Modern non-traditional industries remain prominent, such as chemicals and
petro-chemicals, followed by metals and metal products as well as machine
manufacture. ICICI-assisted projects account for substantial portions of



- 13 -
country's manufacturing capacity in some leading industries like syn-
thetic rubber and electrical machinery. They have contributed significantly
to employment creation and have generated satisfactory net benefits to the
economy.
47.       Operations tend to be geographically concentrated in the estab-
lished industrial centers of the Western States. In line with GOI objec-
tives, ICICI has continued to put increasing emphasis on lending to backward
areas. Loan and investment approvals for backward areas accounted for 45%
of total approvals in the first half of 1974, compared to 17% since ICICI's
inception. This impressive result has been aided by ICICI's recent emphasis
on project promotion, particularly in backward areas. In addition, ICICI
established a new department in 1973 to develop and promote new project
ideas. It also plans to expand the role of its Regional Offices.
48.       Over the past years, ICICI's operations have continued to expand.
Total approvals, however, increased in 1974 by only 6% (representing a
decline in real terms) to Rs 627.2 million, compared with Rs 592.7 million
in 1973 and Rs 523.5 million in 1972. Commitments, which had sharply in-
creased in 1973 to Rs. 629 million from Rs. 362 million in the previous year
because of a large backlog of foreign currency loans approved, declined to
Rs. 505 million in 1974, mainly because of foreign resource constraints,
which forced ICICI to slow down foreign currency commitments. Disbursements
went up by 16% in 1974 to Rs. 484 million, compared with Rs. 416 million in
1973 and Rs. 375 million in 1972.
Portfolio and Financial Results
49.       The repayment performance of ICICI's borrowers has remained good.
On June 30, 1974, the total principal outstanding from loans affected by
arrears was Rs. 109.7 million or 6.8% of the total loan portfolio. Prin-
cipal in arrears was only 1.7% of the outstanding loan portfolio. The in-
vestment portfolio has also shown satisfactory results.
50.       During 1974, ICICI's net income rose by 7% to Rs 26.6 million,
though the return on equity investments declined slightly from 10.7% to
10.1% on account of a reduction in income from equity investments. The
1974 increase in lending rates, scheduled for review again by September-
1975, will permit ICICI to retain its earnings record at an adequate level.
ICICI's liquidity position is somewhat tight but remains adequate and is
expected to improve again in 1976. Its debt service coverage ratio, at
1.2 times during 1974, has been satisfactory. Total reserves and provisions
stood at.Rs 146.4 million on Demceber 31, 1974 or 7% of the loan and invest-
ment portfolio, which is adequate.
51.       In recent years, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have been
affecting ICICI's ability to plan its future operations within the debt/
equity ratio of 9:1 set out under the three previous loan agreements.   ICICI
fully understands the need&to raise additional equity and intends to do so
in regular intervals as its business expands. However, the Indian stock



- 14 -
market has been severely depressed by the Government's ceiling on dividend
payments introduced in July 1974 as part of GOI's policy to curb inflation.
ICICI's shares have been adversely affected along with the rest of the marker,
thus making it uncertain at this point in time that ICICI could go to the
market on reasonable terms in early 1976, when ICICI had originally planned
to raise additional equity. In the course of reviewing ICIC's debt/equity
ratio, it was concluded that it would be reasonable for ICICI to treat as
short-term debt all portions of long-term debt maturing within twelve months,
so that current portions of long-term debt would be excluded from the
calculation of the debt/equity ratio. The effect of applying this redefini-
tion is that ICICI's debt/equity ratio as at December 31, 1974 would be 8:1.
Projected Operations and Resources
52.       Despite the poor overall performance of the industrial sector in
1973, the prospects for certain segments of the sector have shown promise,
particularly over the long-term. Specifically the capital goods indus-
tries, in which ICICI is particularly active, recorded a growth of 13.7%
in the first nine months of 1973 and, for the most part, enjoyed satis-
factory levels of capacity utilization. Moreover, GOI has shown a keen
interest in improving the situation through recent actions (as stated in
paras 30-33 above) and investor interest has continued to grow, as meas-
ured by the issuance of letters of intent and industrial and import li-
censes, particularly in those industries where ICICI is active. Thus,
ICICI can expect a continued growth in loan applications.
53.       ICICI's uncommitted foreign currency resources at December 31,
1974 were US$15 million. Of the previous Bank loans to ICICI not fully
disbursed, the Ninth Loan (Ln. 789 of October 1971) is fully, and the
Tenth Loan (Ln. 902 of June 1973) is more than three quarters committed,
both ahead of schedule. ICICI expects to exhaust its foreign exchange
resources by July 1975, when the proposed loan would become effective. For
the two year period starting July 1, 1975, ICICI expects to commit total
foreign currency loans of US$143 million, of which about US$40 million would
be financed from expected KfW and UK lines of credit and Middle East borrow-
ings. Thus, ICICI's foreign resource gap for the two years from approxi-
mately the time the proposed loan would become effective is about $100
million. A Bank loan for this amount would meet about 70% of ICICI's
requirement over this period.
ICICI's Developmental Impact
54.       A Special Study was undertaken in 1973 jointly by the Bank and
ICICI to measure ICICI's developmental impact. ICICI itself prepared
economic rate of return analyses on an ex post basis for 42 of its projects.
These formed the core of the Study. The results showed that as many as 32
of these projects had economic returns exceeding 12% and 20 projects had
economic returns of more than 20%. Only 10 projects had low or marginal
economic returns (12% or less). Since then, ICICI has continued to calcu-
late such returns for proposed projects where ICICI assistance is greater



- 15 -
than Rs 5 million, or where total project cost is greater than Rs 25 mil-
lion. The results of these calculations have generally been similar to
those of the Special Study. On the basis of an analysis of 39 projects
(ex ante), none of the projects had economic returns of less than 8%,
while 18 had economic returns in excess of 20%.
55.       Thus, the results reinforced ICICI's long-standing reputation
of high quality project assistance. Further, they have shown the inter-
national competitiveness of ICICI-financed projects and their potential
for export. In a selected group of industries, in which ICICI is active,
its clients accounted for almost 18% of India's total exports. ICICI's
other contributions have included the training of many development banking
staff from both India and abroad, client assistance in the formulation of
foreign technical and financial collaboration agreements, advice on appro-
priate product mixes, as well as general financial counselling and under-
writing assistance, which has been enhanced through its recently established
merchant banking unit.
The Proposed Loan
56.       ICICI remains a creditworthy borrower.   It is a financial inter-
mediary, through which the Bank can continue to play an important role in
providing assistance to the Indian industry. The amount of the loan has
been proposed on the basis of ICICI's financing requirements. The use of
the proposed loan would be limited to foreign expenditures. The terms
would follow those of recent Bank loans to development finance companies,
including the standard commitment charge. As in the last three Bank loans
to ICICI, only projects that need more than US$4 million of ICICI's re-
sources, including Bank funds, will require prior approval by the Bank (see
Sec. 2.02 of the draft Loan Agreement). It is expected that the proceeds of
the loan will be used for both modernization and balancing, which would
increase the level of capacity utilization, as well as for new and expansion
projects, where appropriate, on a case by case basis.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
57.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Industrial
Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited, the draft Guarantee
Agreement between India and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the
text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distri-
buted to the Executive Directors separately.



- 16 -
58.       A feature of the Loan Agreement is referred to in paragraph 56.
The draft legal documents conform to the normal pattern for loans to devel-
opment finance companies.
59.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
60.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Generally, the implementation of projects has been proceeding
reasonably well. Details on the execution of individual projects are
below. The level of disbursements was $368 million in FY74 or 83% of
Bank Group commitments in that year. The undisbursed pipeline of $1,273
million as of January 31, 1975, corresponds roughly to commitments over
the preceding 24-month period and reflects the lead time which would be
expected given the mix of fast and slow disbursing projects in the India
program.
Ln. No. 789    Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Prolect; US$60.0 million loan of October 21, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
Ln. No. 902    Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$70.0 million loan of June 8, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
These loans have supported' industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. Loan789-IN is fully committed;
and disbursements under Loan 902-IN are ahead of schedule.
Ln. No. 614    Tarai Seeds.; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969; Closing
Date: December 31, 1974
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in
the development of seeds of high-yielding varieties. The Corporation is
working efficiently and has developed a reputation for excellent seed
quality. Seed production is meeting targets. Implementation problems
over processing plant construction and land-leveling have been resolved
although, as a result of-these delays, an extension of the closing date
by two years has been necessary. Expansion of an existing processing plant
has been completed and expansion of another existing plant is in progress.
Orders are about to be placed for construction and equipment of a new plant
and for a controlled-environment store.
Cr. No. 176    Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana Dam
on the Mahi River and the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam.
The project also includes field channel construction, land-leveling, drain-
age works and roads, and a program to support agricultural development. The
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

project will be completed about two years behind schedule because of delays
in dam construction. The agricultural components of the project are also
behind schedule. Some of the delays in implementation have occurred at the
start of the project before major investments have been made. These will
not affect the economic justification of the project. Further delays have
occurred as a result of building materials shortages. The Government has
recently intervened and made adequate quantities of building materials
available. Progress is now satisfactory.
Cr. No. 268    Pochampad Irrigation; US$39.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The project will assist the comprehensive agricultural development
on the right bank of the Godavari River by providing perennial irrigation to
some 100,000 ha. It includes the construction of Pochampad Dam, a concrete-
lined main canal, distributary canals, field channels, drains and roads.
Until mid-1973, overall performance on the project was satisfactory with
construction and credit disbursements progressing ahead of schedule. Acute
shortages of construction materials, especially explosives for the canal
excavation, have hampered progress. As a result, construction of the main
canals was now falling about one year behind schedule. This is likely to
delay the introduction of irrigation to over 40% of the project area. Land
development is presently haphazard and increasingly lagging behind water
availability in the project. Government is aware of the inadequacy of the
credit operation for land development and has requested IDA financing for
a Command Area Development Project, to be implemented by a Central Authority
.for all farmers in need of land development. Construction of the dam, which
was also affected by temporary shortages of building materials, is now pro-
gressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 532    Godavari Barrage Project; US$45 million credit of March 7, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
This credit has been signed on March 7, 1975, and conditions of
effectiveness will have to be fulfilled by July 7, 1975.
Cr. No. 191    Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million credit of
June 3, 1970; Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Cr. No. 203    Punjab Agricultural Credit Project; US$27.5 million credit of
June 24, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975

Cr. No. 481    Trombay IV Fertilizer Expansion; US$50.0 million credit of
June 19, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Cr. No. 520    Sindri Fertilizer Project; US$91 million credit of
December 18, 1974; Closing Date: September 30, 1978
Ln. No. 1079   IFFCO Fertilizer Project; US$109 million loan of January 24,
1975; Closing Date:  March 31, 1979
The Cochin Fertilizer Project is intended to help finance the ex-
pansion of fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin. The project is now
proceeding about 24 months behind schedule mainly because of procurement de-
lays, slow progress on civil works, and shortages of steel and cement. Pro-
curement problems have been largely overcome, and most of the equipment
is either at the site or at the Gochin port. Another factor which has
contributed to the delay has been technical problems in the commissioning
of the Cochin I plant, which has required a disproportionate amount of man-
agement attention. Credit No. 481 contains funds for a Plant Operations
Improvement Program which will be used in part to overcome these problems;
the use of these funds has been identified on a plant-by-plant basis and
procurement has been initiated. The engineering design for the Gorakhpur
project is well advanced and virtually all the equipment has been ordered.
Although delivery of some equipment is taking longer than forecast during
appraisal, the project is progressing without serious difficulties. Engi-
neering work, procurement and site construction for the Nangal Fertilizer
Project are proceeding satisfactorily. Progress on the Trombay IV project
has been good although project completion may be delayed by about four
months because of longer than expected delivery times for critical equip-
ment. The Sindri Credit became effective on February 27, 1975. Engineer-
ing design and procurement preparations are proceeding on schedule. The
IFFCO loan was signed on January 24, 1975. Conditions of effectiveness
have to be met by March 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 448    Railway XII; US$80 million credit of December 21, 1974;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975
This project consists of new and ongoing works in the Indian
Railways investment program. Disbursements are on schedule.
Cr. No. 294    Bihar Agricultural Markets; US$14.0 million credit of March 29,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Cr. No. 378    Karnataka Wholesale Agricultural Markets Project; US$8.0
million credit of May 9, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
These projects were designed to help with establishment of whole-
sale markets in a number of towns in Bihar and Karnataka. Progress under the
projects has generally been satisfactory. Markets construction in Bihar was
delayed due to legal challenges arising out of the state's acquisition of
land for market sites; however, these difficulties have been satisfactorily
resolved. Market construction in Karnataka is expected to be on schedule.

Cr. No. 312    Population; US$21.2 million credit of June 14, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1978
This credit will help finance an experimental and research
oriented population project in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. Project
implementation is gaining momentum; the construction program is well
under way, and all key project staff have been appointed.
Cr. No. 342    Agricultural Universities; US$12.0 million credit of
November 10, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Progress of implementation has improved with the selection of
campus planners/executive architects, project architects and specialist
advisers. Contract negotiations for these personnel are presently in
progress and appointments are expected to be made shortly. University
development plans and fellowship programs have been submitted to the
Association and are under review. Equipment lists are still being
prepared.
Cr. No. 356    Industrial Development Bank of India; US$25.0 million credit
of February 9, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project had a particularly slow start which was mainly due
to institutional problems in the participating State Financial Corporations.
The last review mission reported in May 1974 that satisfactory progress
could be expected soon. As of February 28, 1975, commitments for sub-
projects reached $4.7 million and disbursements have begun.
Cr. No. 390    Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$55.0 million
credit of January 22, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Project implementation is about 24 months behind schedule because
of delays in appointing consultants and the redesign of major contracts by
a year. Disbursements have been delayed for the same reason, but several
large contracts are now being let, and the disbursement rate should then
improve.
Cr. No. 474    Ninth Industrial Imports Project; US$150.0 million credit of
May 29, 1974; Closing Date: November 30, 1975
Cr. No. 528    Tenth Industrial Imports Program; US$200.0 million credit of
February 14, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The ninth credit was declared effective on June 24, 1974. It is
now fully disbursed. The tenth credit was signed on February 14, 1975 for
the initial tranche of US$100 million and amended to US$200 million on
March 7, 1975. Conditions of effectiveness have to be fulfilled by March 31,
1975.
