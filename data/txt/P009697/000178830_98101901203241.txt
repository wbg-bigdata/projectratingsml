APPRAISAL OF THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND
INVESTMENT CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI)
was twenty years old in January 1975. During this period, ICICI has developed
into a strong institutional source of industrial finance with a level of
approvals reaching about US$80 million per annum. In 1973, ICICI financed
3-4% of total private industrial investment, and disbursed about 20% of all
institutional industrial finance, and 90% of all foreign currency through
industrial institutions.
ii.       The Bank was actively involved in the creation of ICICI, and
has since continued to maintain close contact specifically through the
provision of ten loans amounting to US$326 million (net of cancellations).
The most recent was a US$70 million loan in 1973, of which disbursements
are running well ahead of the original schedule. Up to the end of
December 1974, the Bank had provided 46% of ICICI's total outstanding
resources and 83% of its foreign currency resources. Other sources of
foreign funds have been the USAID, KfW and the UK as well as a Swiss bond
issue. ICICI's rupee funds have been raised through Government borrowings,
share issues, internal cash generation, and more recently through a success-
ful series of debentures.
iii.      ICICI's ownership structure consists of public sector enter-
prises (71%), foreign (18%), and 11% from the Indian private sector.
ICICI has continued to enjoy strong management with all promotions having
taken place from within. Mr. H.T. Parekh continues to be Executive
Chairman, Mr. S. S. Mehta, Managing Director, while Dr. Medhora was recently
appointed Joint Managing Director, and became a member of ICICI's Board
of Directors, which now consists of 16 members. Five are private indus-
trialists while two are from Government. Though ICICI maintains close
contact with Government on industrial policy matters, it nonetheless retains
its operational autonomy. It continues to benefit from a strong well-trained
staff.
iv.       ICICI's operational results showed in 1974 a growth in total
approvals of 6%. ICICI has emphasized the modern non-traditional industries
such as chemicals and petro-chemicals, which account on a cumulative basis
for 21% of total approvals followed by metal and metal products (18%) and
machinery manufacture (16%). In recent years, ICICI has made a concerted
effort to diversify geographically its portfolio towards backward areas
which, in the first half of 1974, accounted for 45% of its total approvals
compared to 17% on a cumulative basis since its inception. This result
has been aided by ICICI's recent emphasis on project promotion, particularly
in backward areas, for which a new Department in ICICI was established in
1973.



- ii -
v.        A Special Study was undertaken in 1973 jointly by the Bank and
ICICI to measure ICICI's developmental impact. Unlike similar studies,
ICICI itself was responsible for preparing economic rate of return analyses on
an ex post basis for 42 of its projects. These formed the core of the Study.
The results showed that, excluding one poor project, the weighted average
economic rate of return was 19.3% and the weighted average financial rate
of return 17.5%. Since then, ICICI has continued to calculate such returns
for proposed projects where ICICI assistance is greater than Rs 5 million
or where total project cost is greater than Rs 25 million. These ex ante
results have generally been similar to those of the Special Study, having
weighted average economic rates of return of 20.3% and weighted average
financial rates of return of 14.0%. Thus, the results reinforced ICICI's
long-standing reputation of high quality project assistance. Further, they
have shown the international competitiveness of ICICI-financed projects and
their potential for export. In a selected group of industries in which
ICICI is active, its clients accounted for almost 18% of India's total exports.
ICICI's other contributions have included the training of many development
banking staff from both India and abroad, client assistance in the formulation
of foreign technical and financial collaboration agreements, advice on
appropriate product mixes, as well as general financial counselling and under-
writing assistance which has been enhanced through its recently established
merchant b,anking unit.
vi.       ICICI's financial position remains satisfactory.  During 1974, net
income rose by 7% to Rs 26.6 million, though the return on equity declined
slightly from 10.7% to 10.1% on account of a reduction in income from equity
investments. The quality of its loan portfolio has remained sound with
a collection record of 90% and only 6.8% of loans outstanding affected by
arrears as of June 30, 1974. Provisions for both loan and equity portfolios
are considered adequate. ICICI's long-term debt/equity ratio as of
December 31, 1974 was 8.0:1 as defined in the proposed Bank loan agreement
to exclude the current portion of long-term debt against a contractual limit
of 9:1. ICICI intends to increase its share capital by an additional Rs 50
million in 1976. For the first time in 1973, ICICI's accounts were audited
in the 'long form'.
vii.      Trhe overall performance of the industrial sector in 1973 was poor
with virtually no growth in industrial production, reflected in declining
levels of capacity utilization. This was on account of temporary shortages
of raw materials, power cuts, labor unrest, and transport bottlenecks rather
th'r4 lack of demand for product output. Nevertheless, the prospects for
certain segments of the industrial sector have shown promise particularly
over the long-term. Specifically, the capital goods industries in which
ICICI is particularly active recorded a growth in industrial production
of 13.7% during the first nine months of 1973 and for the most part enjoyed
satisfactory levels of capacity utilization. Moreover, the Government has
shown a keen interest in improving the situation through recent actions
such as the streamlining of licensing procedures, flexibility towards price
increases iLn a number of industrial commodities, and handling of labor



- iii -
dispu!.es  investor interest has therefore cotntinued to grow, as measured
by the issuance of letters of intent and industrial and import licenses,
particularly in those industries where ICICI is active. Thus, a continued
growth in ICICI loan applications is expected. Given ICICI's sound performance
in resource allocation and its overall developmental impact, it has shown
itself to be of important and effective assistance to Indian industry.
vitii     On the basis of ICICI's present resource position and of its own
and the private industrial sector's foreign resource requirements for the
two ye.ir period ending June 30, 1977, an eleventh loan of $100 million
is recomiiended.  The use of the loan would be limited to expenditures for
impor':s of capital equipment.  It would carry the standard commitment charge,
an interest rate of 8.5% and would be repayable in 18 years including
3 yearr grace. As in previous loans to ICICI, the amortization schedule would
be based on the aggregate amortization schedules of ICICI's loans to sub-
borrowers. ICICI would relend at the rate of interest it normally charges
for its foreign currency loans (presently 10.5% on ordinary loans and 9.5%
on loans in backward areas). The proposed free limit is $4 million (with
no aggregate free limit), the same as in the last three Bank loans.






APPRATSAL OF THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND
INVESTMENT CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI)
was established in 1955 with active World Bank Group assistance. Since then,
the Bank has made ten loans to ICICI totalling $326 million, net of cancella-
tions. In the case of the tenth loan, which amounted to $70 million, approxi-
mately $55 million had been committed as of December 31, 1974 and $19.4 mil-
lion disbursed as of the same date. This is well ahead of the origiual
schedule.   Commitments on earlier loans are already completed.  Somewhat
less than $9 million remain to be disbursed under the ninth loan. The
performance in terms of utilization of these loans is satisfactory.
1.02      ICICI has recently requested an eleventh loan for $100 million.
The loan would be to finance the foreign exchange requirements of ICICI's
clients, for new, expansion, balancing and modernization projects, where
appropriate, in the industrial sector. ICICI's long established appraisal
capacity would ensure that only economically viable projects would be
financed. This would contribute to fulfilling GOI's objectives, such as
growth in industrial production and a potential increase in exports. With
these objectives in mind and on the basis of the appraisal contained in this
report, an eleventh loan of $100 million is recommended.
II. ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT
The Economic Enivironment
2.01      An assessment of India's present economic position is contained
in the Bank's latest Economic Report No. 402-IN entitled "The Economic
Situation and Prospects of India" dated May 7, 1974. The annual growth
rate of net domestic product (at factor cost) fell from 5.5% in 1969/70
to -1.7Y in 1972/73 in constant prices. However, due to an improvement
in agricultural production, on which the economy is primarily based and
which contributes 43% to value added, net domestic product was expected
to grow at 5.5% in 1973/74 reaching a level of about US$56 billion. Growth
rates for the subsequent two years are expected to average 2.6% per annum.
This is partly attributable to the fact that the monsoon this year (1974/75)
has fallen well short of expectations.
2.02      In addition, the impact of the substantial increase in oil
prices 1/ in late 1973 eliminated one of india's few relative strengths,
1/   As well as the price of foodgrains, fertilizer, and many other basic
imports.



-2-
namely a reasonably adequate foreign exchange reserve position, since it
is expected to reduce India's terms of trade index by about 25% from 1972/73
to 1974/75. In the case of merchandise trade, India experienced a deficit
of US$560 million in 1973/74 which is expected to increase to a deficit of
$1.8 billion in 1974/75. The oil component of India's imports is expected
to increase from 10.2% to 26.8% over this period. India's total foreign
reserves declined from US$1.4 billion in June 1973 to about US$1 billion by
December 11973. 1/ Subsequently, India has been forced to avail itself of
the compensatory finance scheme of the IMF in addition to drawing down part
of its credit tranches and all of its gold tranche.
2.03      As a result of the substantial changes in both the world and Indian
economies, the Fifth Five Year Plan, which was expected to commence in April
1974, is being revised. The Draft Plan had envisaged an average annual
growth rate of 5.5% with heavy emphasis on agriculture and industry as well
as the social objectives of eradicating poverty and reducing unemployment.
The Fifth Five Year Plan has yet to emerge in a revised form and thus
investmenl: continues to take place without any official long-term frame-
work.
2.04      One important problem facing GOI at present is the level of infla-
tion. Large price increases began in the middle of 1972 and continued to
grow inI intensity. The wholesale price index grew by 28.9% between March 1973
and March 1974 compared to 14.4% in the previous year. The most significant
part was accounted for by a 28.5% increase in food prices (food represents
41% of the index by weight), though fuel and power prices increased by 53%
and industrial raw materials by 37%. GOI has taken a variety of measures to
reduce the level of inflation (para 2.33) with some recent success as the
wholesale price index actually fell by 4.3% from September to December 1974.
From February 1974 to February 1975, the rate of inflation was about 14%.
.,05      For the past several years, the Central Government has continued
to record budgetary deficits (Rs 1.5 billion projected in 1974/75). Moreover,
tOI introduced a mini-budget in July 1974, to increase tax revenues by
Rs 2.3 billion largely through increased excise taxes, as well as taxes on
capital gains and commercial bank income. These increased revenues are
e.x_pected to merely maintain the original budget deficit of Rs 1.25 billion.
Further, total domestic savings as a percentage of NNP at factor cost is ex-
pected to decline from 11.9% in 1972/73 to around 11% in 1973/74 due to a
decline in savings in the Government and household sectors while as a result,
net inVeStment as a percentage of NNP at factor cost is expected to record a
decline from 12.8% to around 12% over the same period.
industrial Sector
*.00      The industrial sector 2/ presently accou1its for about 24% of Gross
nomest c Product of which mantufacturing represents 16%. From 1969 to 1974,
1/   During 1972/73, total exports grew by 24.9% while total imports grew
by LL6.7%.
I Manufacturing, construction, electricity, gas and water supply.

the industrial growth rate averaged 4% per annum and was well below the Plan's
target of 8.0%. Industrial investment in 1972/73 represented 23% of total
gross fixed capital formation of which about 60% related to the private
sector.   Nonetheless, private industrial investment contributes about 85%
of value added, partly due to inefficient management of the industrial
public sector.
2.07      The structure of the industrial sector has undergone a considerable
change during the past 20 years as a result of GOI's concerted import sub-
stitution drive. Specifically, the historical preponderance of consumer
goods (mainly textiles) in the industrial sector has been superseded by
the growth of intermediate and capital goods which contributed 56% to total
industrial value added in 1973 compared to 49% in 1961 and 32% in 1951. A
detailed breakdown of registered industrial factories showing value added is
given in Annex 1. At the same time, over a similar period, GOI has put
increasing emphasis on small scale industry. 1/ It is estimated that SSI
contributes almost 50% to industrial value added and employs between five and
six million people.
2.08      There continues to be considerable unutilized capacity amongst
industries, particularly in the public sector. It is estimated that overall
industrial capacity utilization actually fell from 72% during 1971/72 to
66% during 1972'73.  This is on account of a general shortage of foreign
exchange, particularly for the purchase of raw materials in short supply,
substantial power cuts which have affected levels of production, and a certain
amount of 'abor unrest. Moreover, the restrictions through a variety of
regulations and controls over the growth, particularly of the Large Houses, 2/
as evidenced by the adoption of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade
Practices Act (1969), has inhibited industrial output, though these have
recently been eased (para 2.13). It is not surprising, then, to find that
industrial production recorded virtually no growth in 1973, though it is
significant to point out that the capital goods industries experienced a
growth rate of 13.7% for the first nine months of 1973 (Annex 2).3/
2.09      The total industrial sector employs an estimated 20 million people
or a liteLe more thani 11% of the total labor force.  The industrial regional
developmTnent of India as measured by value added has tended to be concen-
trated In a few more advanced states such as Maharashtra (28.7%), West Bengal
(14.9%)  Ki.arnataka (9.1%) and Gujarat (8.1%) (Annex 3).  GOI, through fiscal
incentives, is making efforts at attaining a better geographical diversifi-
cation,
I/   Defined as investment in plant and machiinery valued at less than Rs 750,000
($100,000), and in the case of ancillary industry valued at less than

2.10      The manufacturing sector has contributed to the country's overall
export performance with exports of approximately US$1 billion in 1971/72
(40% of total exports), US$1.0 billion in 1972/73 (42% of total exports and
US$1.5 billion in 1973/74 (46% of total exports). A substantial increase in
exports might be achieved if an appropriate export plan were developed by
GOI, particularly against the background of rising international prices
that have made the possibility of exports much more attractive to Indian
manufacturers. As part of the proposed loan, ICICI confirmed that it would
undertake a study of the problems and prospects of manufactured exports
(para 5.07).
Industrial Policy
2.11      GOI has articulated over the years a number of industrialization
objectives including an emphasis on import substitution, employment generation,
the development of small scale industries, regional development particularly
in backward areas, diversification of India's industrial base, and greater
income distribution through restrictions on monopolies particularly by Large
Houses. To implement such multiple objectives, GOI has utilized a variety
of instruments including rigid controls on licensing all new investment (in
excess of Rs 10 million with a few exceptions) as well as controls of imports
of capital equipment, foreign technological collaboration, capital issues,
monopoly restrictions and through taxation policy and price controls.
2.12      In an effort to encourage industrial investment, a number of policy
changes have taken place in the past 18 months. In November 1973, GOI over-
hauled its industrial license system to cut down on processing time. Speci-
fically, a Project Approval Board (an inter-Ministerial Group) was established
to process all license requests. It created its own Secretariat for Indus-
trial Approvals (SIA) made up of representatives of various ministries. Of
key importance was the establishment of specific target dates for the first
time wherein decisions had to be taken within 90 days on industrial license
applications, within 120 days where any additional clearances were required,
and within 150 days for MRTP clearance. At the same time, firms were expected
to begin operations within two years after receiving licenses while entre-
preneurs who had received letters of intent were required to obtain a license
within six months or the letter of intent would lapse. To date, the targets
have generally been met and this has acted as a considerable boost to
entrepreneurs.
2.13      GOI has liberalized its conitrol over prices of key products such
as cement, commercial vehicles, steel, and aluminum, etc. GOI's Annual
Budget in the Spring of 1974 did not impose additional taxes on the industrial
sector, and even extended the development tax rebate for equipment by a
year where contracts for purchases had been made prior to December 1, 1973.
Further, GOI's control over the Large Houses was somewhat relaxed in 1973
by enlarging the list of industries in which they could invest. Finally,
GOI successfully withstood the recent railway strike.



- 5 -
2.14      Partly as a result of these changes in GOI's industrial policy, and
despite the overall difficulties faced by the Indian economy, private indus-
trial investment (as measured by the granting of industrial licenses) has con-
tinued to grow substantially in the past 18 months. From January to June 1974,
697 letters of intent were issued to industrialists compared to 274 for the
same period of the previous year. Likewise, 525 industrial licenses were
issued between January and June compared to 241 for the same period for 1973.
Of particular relevance, intermediate and capital goods industries represented
the majority of the industrial licenses, particularly electrical and chemical
industries. A similar pattern hias been apparent in capital goods clearances,
where the value of import clearances to ICICI and IFCI, the two major sources
of foreign exchange for term loans was Rs 814 million during January-June
1974 compared with Rs 235 million for the same period in 1973. Thus, in-
dustrial investment in the more sophisticated technical areas in which
ICICI is particularly active continues to grow despite the uncertain overall
economic situation in India.
2.15      Offsetting this, however, have been a number of other GOI decisions
some of which have had an impact on industrial investment. A Foreign Exchange
Regulations Act which came into effect in January 1974 stipulated that enter-
prises with foreign shareholding would have to reduce the level of foreign
ownership to 40/' over an unspecified time except where the enterprise exports
over 60% of its output, uses sophisticated technology or operates in a high
priority industry in which case the shareholding must not exceed 74%.
2.16      In addition, GOI recently enacted two related Ordinances i-n July
1974a in response to the mounting rate of inflation. The first, The Addi-
tional Emolument (Compulsory Deposit) Ordinance requires that all incre-
mental. wages and salaries 1/ of employees for one year and 50% of dearness
allowances for two years be withheld and deposited in banks at 2-1/2% above
the bank deposit rate to reduce purchasing power. At the same time, the
Companies (Temporary Restrictions on Dividends) Ordinance was issued which
limited dividend payments of corporations to one-third of net profits or 12%
of the face value of equity shares in addition to dividends payable on
preference shares whichever is lower. The latter Ordinance had a dramatic
impact on the stock market prices and reduced the number of capital issues
(para 2.35). The dividend restriction is expected to last for two years, and
thus investors with long term objectives should not be unduly affected.
2.17      Overall, the prospects over the long-term for additional industrial
investment, both in the case of balancing and modernization as well as new
and expansion projects, is good particularly in the capital goods industries
where ICICI is active.

IndustriaJl Finance
2.18      Though there are no definitive data on sources and uses of funds
for the industrial sector as a whole, estimated industrial gross fixed capital
formation totalled Rs 18.2 billion in FY 73, up from Rs 15.0 billion in the
previous year (Annex 4);1/ of this amount Rs 10.6 billion (58%) represented
capital formation in the private sector.
2.19      ICICI has estimated that 50% of long-term finance of the private
industrial sector was internally generated, 35% represented foreign invest-
ment and institutional finance, and 15% capital issues. On the other
hand, public sector enterprises have obtained a much lower proportion of
their financing from institutional sources. Small scale sector industrialists
financed at least 50% of their operations through non-institutional sources
such as moneylenders. The term lending financial institutions represented
an estimated 11.9% of total industrial investment and 20.5% of total private
industrial investment in 1972/73 (Annex 4). Sources of industrial finance
in India can be usefully divided into All-India and state institutions.
2.20      All-India Institutions.  The major sources of funds for industrial
long-term finance are the All-India institutions namely IDBI, ICICI, IFCI,
LIC and UTI 2/ (Annex 5). All of these institutions have concentrated their
lending in the medium- and large-scale industrial sector.  These institutions
have financed primarily the private and joint sectors despite the 1970 GOI
directive to these institutions to finance, where possible, public sector
enterprises to expose such enterprises to the discipline of comprehensive
appraisal and follow-up work. Nevertheless, in the past few years GOI has
continued to allow public sector enterprises to rely primarily on government
appropriations for their funds.
2e21      With the exception of the recent IDA Credit to the State Financial
Corporations 3/ channelled through IDBI primarily for small-scale industries,
the only institutional sources of foreign exchange in India are ICICI and to
a linited extent IFCI. ICICI and IFCI have received about 40% by value of
capital goods committee (CGC) approvals over the past few years. The balance
has come from direct government allocations from free foreign exchange,
bilateral assistance and suppliers' credits.
2.22      IDBI.  The most important source of institutional industrial
finance is IDBI which acts as the apex institution for all other financial
1/ Reprefsenting a growth of 7.7% in real terms.

intermediaries and is a strong institution in its own right. Its activities
include granting direct loans, rediscounting commercial bills, the re-
financing of loans made by the SFCs and commercial banks, providing export
finance, underwriting, and guarantee operations. As of December 31, 1973,
IDBI had outstanding about Rs 4 billion in financial assistance of all types.
Nevertheless, IDBI finances only an estimated 4-5% of total industrial
investment in India. Its direct loans have been concentrated on fertilizers,
chemicals, and iron and steel, while its rediscounting has been concentrated
on textiles and machinery. It is expected that IDBI will shortly be appraised
for a direct line of credit. A detailed review of its activities is in
Annex 6.
2.23      IFCI.  IFCI, established in 1948, is the oldest term-lending
institution in India with total assets of Rs 2.2 billion as of June 30, 1973
and is presently a subsidiary (50% ownership) of IDBI, though it operates
relatively independently. IFCI does a sma'll amount of foreign currency
lending, but its activities have been primarily in local currency financing
particularly in the traditional subsectors such as sugar and textiles. A
detailed analysis of IFCI3s operations is in Annex 7.
2,24      lIC. LIC is the most important institution underwriting equity
and debenture issues for the industrial sector.  It was formed by the
nationalization -"7 numerous private insurance companies in 1956.  Its total
assets as of March 31, 1973 were Rs 25.2 billion.  Of this, Rs 20.5 billion
is invested in a variety of Indian financial instruments of which approxi-
mately 75% are in the public and only 14%r in the private sector.  Unlike
rcIcI, IDBI1 and IFCI, it is guided by policy directives which emphasize profit
maximization despite the requirement that 50% of its funds must be invested
in government securities.  A breakdown of LIC's investments outstanding in
industries as of March 31, 1973 is in Annex 8. Total investments (excluding
loans) were Rs 2.3 billion of which 98% were in  the private sector.
2.25      UTI. Unit Trust of India (UTI) is similar to LIC in terms of
investment policy.  It was established in 1964 and designed to attract house-
hold savings. UTI has also contributed to the growth of the capital market.
Like LIC, 'ITi has its own source of funds (trust certificates) as well as a
policy of profit maximization. UTI's share of total underwriting and direct
subscrintion to shares and debentures of financial institutions has averaged
about 22% of sanctions over the past three years.  At the end of March 1973,
UTI had Rs 1,42 billion invested, distributed amongst ordinary shares (Rs 0.6
billion), preference shares (Rs 0.15 billion), debentures (Rs 0.48 billion)
and others (Rs 0.18 billion).
2.26      IRGI.  A sixtlh institution, though not officially an All-India
instit%:tior, is tl)e IlkCI (Industrial Recolnstruction Corporation of India),
a subsid'larv oe$ IDBI, which was established in 1971 to provide managerial
and financial assistance to "sick" industries in WesL Bengal. Though IRCI
is still relatively new, its operations have begtn to grow and involved
Rs 9 million in arprovals in FY73. In re~cent years, it has tried to expand



- 8-
the scope of its operations beyond West Bengal. A detailed analysis of its
operations is in Annex 9.
2.27      NSIC.  Finally, the National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC)
has provided since 1956 hire purchase financing for small scale industries
resulting in equipment deliveries of Rs 656 million, though it has been
a largely ineffective institution. A detailed discussion of its activities
is in Annex 10.
2.28      State Financial Institutions.  At State level, the most important
institutions in terms of financing medium- and large-scale industry are the
State Industrial Development Corporations (SIDCs) (excluding the commercial
banks). In FY73, the SIDCs, which have been formed in nearly all States,
accounted for about 10% of institutional finance to the industrial sector.
A substantial proportion went to the joint and public sectors. The functions
of the SIDCs themselves vary widely from one State to another. In some, they
are actively involved in all sectors of industry through loan and equity
investments as well as through handling the implementation of government
incentive schemes. The possibility that the SIDCs might be included under
the IDBI refinance scheme 1/ is under active consideration.
2.29      The State Financial Corporations (SFCs) have been active in making
term loans, largely to the small-scale sector (Annex 11), and had outstandings
of Rs 1.9 billion as of March 31, 1973. Since 1973, the SFCs have had
access to foreign exchange amounting to US$25 million from the IDA Credit
(356-IN) channelled through IDBI of which US$4.0 million had been committed as
of November 30, 1974. The proposal to establish Special Capital facilities
with all SFCs through contributions from State Governments and RBI/IDBI
to be used for equity financing of risky projects should, if implemented,
meet a crucial requirement of new small-scale enterprises. Moreover, the
State Small Industries Corporations (SSICs) also provide a modest amount of
financial assistance to the small-scale sector through hire purchase finance.
Further, the State Small Industries Development Corporations (SSIDCs) are
responsible to the State Directorates of Industry in the promotion of indus-
trial estates. Finally, State Governments have utilized "State Aid to
Industry" programs to channel funds to the small-scale sector totalling about
Rs 30 million per annum. In five States, the SFCs are used as the channel.
Loans are usually limited to Rs 100,000 for industries and Rs 200,000 for
cooperatives and carry interest rates varying from 2-1/2% to 7%.
2.30      Commercial Banks.  Historically, commercial banks in India have
played an important role in the financing of industry, medium-, large-
and small--scale. Since 1969, when 14 commercial banks were nationalized,
lending byr commercial banks has become a more direct instrument of govern-
ment industrial policy, (though this emphasis had already begun by govern-
ment seveiral years before nationalization) by giving priority to financing

the sma1ll-scale sector, and also to establishing an adequate branch network
to cater to this group.
2.31      The level of scheduled commercial bank credit outstanding (both
short- and long-term) to large and medium industry, increased from Rs 20.7
billion in MXarch 1968 to Rs 30.5 billion as of Ju-ne 30, 1972.  At the same
time, outstanding credit to the small-scale sector increased from Rs 2.1
billion in March 1968 to Rs 6.4 billion as of December 1972. 1/  The propor-
tion of total bank lending to mediumn and large industries declined from 60.6%
to 45.',% while tihat to small industries increased from 6.9% to 12.1%.  Com-
mercial banks had 3,632 branches in 1969, almost doubling to 15,632 in the
past four years.
2X32      The commercial banks have also become active in industrial term
lend:ing with an estimated 15% of total outstandings in this form.  From
Arnex 12, as of June 197J lhe scheduled commercial banks had Rs 1.2 billion
in term loans outstanding to the small-scale sector, a somewhat lower amount
than the total outstanding financial assistance by the SFCs at September 1973
of Rs 1.9 billion.a The rate of interest charged by commercial banks has gradually
increased over tle past few years ranging between 11% and 13% in calendar 1973,
the lower rate representing the minimum that can be charged except for some
specific priority sectors, Penalty fees in some cases were as high as 4%.
In the case of term loans, maturities were generally up to seven years.
2.33      interest rates.  Because of the rising rates of inflation and the
rapid growth in money supply (15% in each of the past two years), since the
middle of 1973 when the Bank Rate was first raised from 5-7%, GOI has
adopted a policy of credit restraint, This covers a series of measures to
restrict the expansion of credit in the form of credit ceilings, changes in
commercial bank statutory and liquidity ratios, and increased borrowing rates
from REI. In addition, Interest on deposits was raised by between 0.25% to
1%, while commercial banks raised their lending rate from 11% to 12% in
April/May, 1974. The various measures were unsuccessful in cutting the expan-
sion of credit. Against this background, GOI, in July 1974, raised the Bank
rate again from 7, to 9% (Annex 13).  Commercial banks followed by increasing
their own prime lending rate to 12,57, though most banks charge more (up
to 15%).  Finally, in July 1974, as part of the mini-budget, a tax on comnercial
bank ieterest income was imposed and was expected to be passed on to final
borrowe.rs in the form of a 1%. rate increase. T'he All-India institutions also
increased their local cuirrenrcy lendring rates following the lead of IDBI, while
ICICI and IFCI increased their foreign currercy lending rate by 1%.
2.34      Conimoinm  Appraisal Jn.t.  A Bill is presently undc:r discussion in
Pariiame.t, which would, amongst other things, amend the IDBI Act to transfer
IDBBI shares 17rom the RBI Lo COIT  and ivr general, increase IDBI's role as the
apex term .-i.n   nsttlLution o       u ' ,>L  oLher :.crk lending irstitutions (Annex
14). A crollarv of this Bill has beeni a proposal (which is not included
I   Rts ~73 bil_ion as of June 1973.



- 10 -
in the Bill itself) to establish a Common Appraisal Unit as a subsidiary of
IDBI to appraise projects jointly financed by term lending institutions.
The proposal arose as a result of complaints from entrepreneurs who felt that
there was excessive duplication involved in the appraisal and follow-up of
projects which were jointly financed by two or more All-India institutions.
Over the past few years, the All-India institutions, conscious of this
criticism, had taken steps to reduce the duplication of work by entrepreneurs
through the use of joint appraisal teams (while still reserving the right of
each institution to submit to its own Board a recommendation by its staff
for each project). The coordination has been aided through the use of the
Inter-Institutional meetings where all such projects are discussed in detail.
The degree of independence of the financial institutions over loan recommenda-
tions by the Common Appraisal Unit has not yet been established, nor have
many other details such as staffing been resolved. In any case, the proposal
could not be implemented until after the consideration of the IDBI Bill by
Parliament. It is expected that this unit will take some time to become
operational and would probably not affect the allocation of the proposed loan.
In any event, it is expected that the term lending institutions, all of whom
have high appraisal standards, will take the lead in the actual implement-
ation of the proposed and arrive at a satisfactory system.
2.35      Capital Market.  Though the number of capital issues for industrial
concerns increased from 143 to 202 from 1972 to 1973, the issued amount fell
from Rs 1.19 billion to Rs 1.1 billion (-7.4%) while new issues 1/ actually
showed a decline from Rs 935 million to Rs 730 million (-22%). This reflects
the emergence of small and medium firms on the market. RBI's index of security
prices increased from 93 in January 1973 to 133 in July 1974. However, with
the recent restriction on dividends (para 2.16), the Stock Exchange was forced
to suspend trading in certain shares, and limit purchases and sales of other
shares within prescribed limits, in order to hold down the decline in the
stock market. The new dividend Ordinance has already had a significant nega-
tive impact on the prospects for new issues which declined to 47 (Rs 201
million) from July to December 1974 compared to 88 (Rs 361 million) for the
same period in 1973. The RBI's share price index fell from 133 in July to
103 in January 1975.
III. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Share Capital and Ownership
3.01      As of January 31, 1975, ICICI's paid-in capital was Rs 150 million.
The last increase took place in November 1973 when ICICI made a rights
issue of Rs 50 million, of which Rs 25 million was paid-in then and the
balance by January 1975. With this latest capital inflow, the Indian public

sector shareholding increased to 71%, compared with 64% at end of 1972. As
in previous issues, a number of foreign shareholders either did not part-
icipate or sold their shares entirely. 1/ Thus, foreign shareholding decreased
from 25% to 18%. The share of Indian private investors remained at about 11%.
Principal shareholders are listed in Annex 15.
Organization and Staff
,.02   Board of Directors.  ICICI's Board now comprises 16 directors 2/
(including the Chairman) of which 5 are connected with leading industrial
groups, 3 represent foreign shareholders, 3 are full time officers of ICICI,
3 are senior officers of public financial institutions and 2 are GOI senior
officials (Annex '6).  To relieve the Chairman from some Board respon-
sibilities, the pesiLion of Vice Chairman was created during 1973. It was
filled by Mr. J. S. Raj, a former Vice President of IFC, and now Chairman
of UTI. Mr. ii. T. Parekn continues to be ICICI's Board Chairman.  The Board
members meet once a month and maintain a very close relationship with ICICI's
management.  They take a keen interest in ICICI's affairs and decide on all
project proposals except for operations of Rs 1 million or less which can be
approved by the Chairman (up to a limit of Rs 10 million a month). Equity
and debenture sales by ICICI are decided upon by an Investment Committee of
the Board headed by the Chairman. The two GOI directors provide a useful
liaison with GGT on general policy issues and on specific project proposals,
thus adequately complementing the background and experience of the other
directors.
3,03       alnagement.  A number of changes in ICICI's management became
effective in April 1974. Dr. P. B. Medhora, previously General Manager,
was promoted 'o Joint Managing Director, and now shares with Mr. S. S. Mehta,
the senior Managing Director, the responsibility for all operational aspects
of ICICI (para 3.06). He was also appointed the sixteenth member of the
Board of Directors (para 3.02). Mr. S. Kumarasundaram (formerly Deputy
General Manager) has been promoted to General Manager, Mr. S. Nadkarni
(formerly Assistant General Manager) has become the Deputy General Manager
and Mr. R. 1 Ohari (formerly head of ICICI's Madras office) has been appointed
Azsistant G-eneral1. fanager.  Though Hlr. Parekh still actively functions as
Executive Chairman, the trend continues towards a gradual transfer of execu-
tive respunsibility. In addition, ICICI's management has expressed its inten-
tion to iive more decision making responsibility to heads of departments.
Tris appciars appropriate in view of the increasing volume and complexity of
ICICI's operations.  ICICI's middle management is capable and experienced
and should be able to undertake the added responsibilities. As evidence of
chis, ICICI has been able to fill all its top management positions with
promotions frorm withini.
1/   However, the Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken of Sweden became a shareholder
for the iirst time. Foreign shareholdings are likely to diminish further
as a proportion of ICICI's capital as the latter increases.
2/   Previously ICICI's board had 15 directors (para 3.03).



- 12 -
3.04      Staff.  As of December 31, 1974, ICICIts staff numbered 386 of which
165 were professionals, compared to 116 professionals at the end of 1972.
The 1973 recruitment was the largest in ICICI's history and has somewhat
mitigated the shortage problems discussed during negotiations for the 10th
Bank loan. Almost half of the new professional staff were assigned to
project appraisal and follow-up work, the two areas where the need was more
apparent. However, further recruitment is necessary for the Project Ap-
praisal Department since, despite the recent hirings, resignations and
transfers to the Project Promotion Department (para 3.06) resulted in a net
gain of only three additional professionals 1/.  The Project Promotion
Department and the regional offices (para 3.07) are also at present under-
staffed, with 4 and 14 professionals respectively. During negotiations,
ICICI confirmed that it planned to recruit three to four new professionals
for both the Projects Department and the Project Promotion Department
by the end of 1975.
3.05      The overall quality of ICICI's staff remains high.  Because of its
prestige, competitive remuneration and working conditions, ICICI has been
able to attract qualified and competent new recruits, whose training is
systematically and adequately undertaken through orientation programs, rota-
tional assignments in different departments, as well as on-the-job instruction.
Permanent staff attend general refresher courses, lectures and classes on
specialized topics. ICICI also considers the secondment of its staff to
other financial institutions as part of its overall staff development. Staff
morale is good and turnover low. Over 55% of the professionals have worked
for ICICI for more than 5 years.
3.06      Organization.  ICICI's organizational structure is shown in the
attached chart. In practice, the organization is flexible and informal and
no conventional demarcation of responsibilities exists amongst the two
Managing Directors. However, Mr. S. S. Mehta tends to focus more on project
evaluation and development, administration, establishment, and personnel,
while Dr. Mledhora is more closely associated with follow-up, resource mobili-
zation, finance, and general problems of economic analysis. In view of the
intention to delegate increasing responsibility (para 3.03) some effective
streamlining of the organizational structure has recently taken place. Also,
three new operational units were established in 1973: the Project Promotion
Department, the Small Loans Division, and the Merchant Banking Division.
All three were put under the supervision of the Deputy General Manager, who
closely coordinates their activities with those of the Project Department.
3.07      The regional offices in Calcutta and Madras, established in 1969,
are now imdertaking almost 30% of ICICI's follow-up work. Though there has
been an increasing involvement in project anpraisal work by regional office
staff, this is still done with significant assistance from lheadquarters.
Also, the increase in appraisal activity has been at the expense of follow-up
visits. M1oreover, the regional offices could make a more substantial con-

Department have 21 and 4 professionals respectively.



- 13 -
tribution to ICICI1s activities, not only in project appraisal, but also in
promotion, partly as a useful device to attain a better overall geographical
distribution of its portfolio (Annex 18, para 10). Thus, thie regional offices,
with 8 and 6 professionals respectively, are at present under-staffed
(para 3.04). During negotiations, ICICI confirmed its intention to expand
the staff of its two regional offices in Calcutta and Madras in the near
future to increase their appraisal and follow-up activities, and to appoint
another senior staff member in each office so as to provide the appropriate
promotional input through liaison with other financing institutions, State
Governments, and private entrepreneurs. ICICI would also arrange for periodic
transfer of staff between its Head office and Regional offices to strengthen
the regional office and facilitate effective delegation of authority. Never-
theless, "grass roots" promotion of new project ideas (para 5.13) would
still be confined to the Head office to ensure adequate supervision by
management.
3.08      ICIGI has decided to establish an office in Delhi, mainly to serve
as a liaison with the Government. In view of the growing public sector
shareholding in ICCICI, and of ICICI's increasing coordination with the Govern-
ment in industrial policy matters (para 5.16), this is highly desirable.
Policies and Procedures
3.09      0       gPolicies.  ICICI has no formal policy statement to guide
its overall operations.  However, its Memorandum of Association sets a
number of specific objectives, which, complemented with Board resolutions
adopted from time to time, and Government guidelines provide a framework
for ICICI's activities. Its lending and investment policies have not changed
much in tne last few years and continue to be satisfactory. Decisions on
exposure in a single enterprise continue to be made on the merits of each
case. As of June 30, 1974, there were 15 companies in which ICICI had an
exposure (approvals net of cancellations and repayments) amounting to more
than 10% of its equity. None of these companies is in financial difficulty
and all have satisfactorily serviced their debts to ICICI and others.
3ot`      ICICI's interest rates and other charges as of August 31, 1974 are
.1aowr1 in Annex  7. Against the background of rising interest rates in India
(para 2.33), its lending rates were increased in August, 1974.  Local currency
rates were increased from 9% to 10-1/4% (in line with IDBI's increase), and
foreign currency rates from 9,5% to 10.5% on ordinary loans and from 9% to
9,5% for concessionary loans (backward areas). 1/  IFCI's foreign currency
lending rates i ave also been increased, in line with those of ICICI.  As ICICI
passes on the foreign exchange risk to sub-borrowers, and in view of the
general liarest rate structure in  the countrYv  ICICI's present lending rates
are ade.iia<  Tiowevesr, because of the receat increase in the IBRD lending
rate, ICICT   s confirmed that it will review its foreign currency lending
rates by September 30, 1975.
1/   5CIC  also charges an additional irterest rate of 1, to private limited
cem3arnics s;ince it does niot have the opportunity to enjoy equity
participations.



- 14 -
3.11      Project Evaluation and Follow-up.  ICICI's standards and practices
for project appraisal and supervision continue to be high. Technical,
financial, and market aspects of projects are well handled in appraisal
reports. Coverage of the economic contribution of projects is now also
adequate. ICICI was among the first of the DFC's associated with the Bank to
use the economic rate of return criterion (para 5.01), in addition to other
partial indicators for economic evaluation of projects. Through its appraisal
work, ICICI has in the form of a "spread effect" helped its clients to intro-
duce new financial and management techniques such as the cash flow concept,
internal rate of return, break-even analysis, etc.  It has also helped its
clients irn marketing arrangements, determination of optimal product-mixes,
cost estinmation, formulation of foreign collaboration agreements, 1/ and
strengthening of capital structure. In projects not requiring an industrial
license, ICICI has been able to become involved at an early stage, before the
project's essential specification (location, capacity, technical processes, etc.)
have been determined. In these cases, it has usually been able to help in
shaping these specifications. In the other cases, it also plays a useful, but
more limited role. For example, though it is difficult for ICICI to suggest
increases in plant capacity after a license has been issued, it is able to
suggest lower plant sizes when economies of scale and/or the level of existing
capacity in the country justifies it.
3.12      Its post-finance follow-up activities, are likewise designed to
assist IC]:CI's clients in project implementation and management tasks. For
example, ICICI has successfully persuaded many of its clients to adopt project
scheduling techniques such as PERT and Critical Path Analysis, to help the
sponsors keep track of project implementation. The good condition of ICICI's
portfolio (para 6.04) reflects in part its effective follow-up procedures.
Its clients submit detailed quarterly progress reports which it regularly
reviews. From these reviews, difficult projects or those with potential or
actual problems are visited by ICICI's staff at least once a year. ICICI
also reserves the right to appoint a director on a borrower's board and has
done so in 60 cases.
3.13      Procurement and Disbursement.  Though ICICI does not in general
require ilts clients to apply international competitive bidding, it insists
on competitive quotations from three or more reputed manufacturers/suppliers
of plant and equipment, which it carefully reviews and updates where
appropriate. Disbursement procedures also remain satisfactory. ICICI is
now also considering opening its own letters of credit in order to provide
speedier service to its clients.
1/   50% of all ICICI projects have involved some sort of foreign collabora-
tion agreement.

Overall Operations
3.14      As of December 31, 1974, ICICI had financed 1,615 projects for some
900 clients since its inception. Aggregate approvals of loans, guarantees
and investments amounted to Rs 5.1 billion at that date. Foreign currency
loans accounted for Rs 3.0 billion or 59% of total approvals, and foreign
currency guarantees for Rs 62.8 million, or 1%; rupee loans, underwriting,
and direct investment were 23%, 14% and 4% respectively. 1/ Its loan dis-
bursements account for about 3% - 4% of total private industrial investment
and about 20% of disbursements by All-India development finance institutions.
ICICI's financing has mainly gone to medium and relatively large-scale
manufacturing enterprises in the private sector. Emphasis has been given
to the modern and non-traditional sectors such as chemicals/petrochemicals
(21%) and metals/metal products (18%), and has involved introduction into
India of complicated and new technologies. The geographical distribution
of ICICI's assistance has tended to concentrate somewhat unevenly in the
Western states, though an increasing effort to assist backward areas is
apparent. Reflecting the good quality of ICICI's appraisal work, the
capacity utilization performance of its projects has been satisfactory. The
financial performance of its clients has also remained good. ICICI's clien-
tele is adequately diversified. Details on the above characteristics of
ICICI's operations, and a discussion of recent trends are in Annex 18.
IV. RESOURCE MOBILIZATION
General
4.01      ICICI's resources totalled Rs 2,782.7 million as of December 31,
1974. Foreign resources ($242 million) accounted for 63% of the total
while domestic resources provided the balance of 37% or Rs 1,019.8 million.
ICICI's resource position is summarized in Annex 19.
Local Currency
4.02      Out of its total domestic resources of Rs 1,019.8 million, ICICI's
own debentures (5 issues) accounted for Rs 350 million, or 34%. The balance
was obtained from GOI and IDBI loans (39%), share capital (12%), and inter-
nal cash generation (15%). Annex 20 gives details of the terms and condi-
tions for ICICI's rupee borrowings. ICICI has been attempting to diversify
its sources of local currency funds away from GOI and IDBI loans in order
to increase its mobilization impact and reduce its dependence on official
sources of funds. It is not possible to go to the shareholders too fre-
quently, and thus ICICI has approached the market three times after 1955
(in 1967, 1971, and 1973) to raise its share capital from Rs 50 million to
1/   Domestic currency guarantees account for about 0.2%.



- 16 -
Rs 150 million. It also has followed a prudent dividend policy (para 6.02)
ploughing back to reserves and retained earnings some Rs 13-14 million
per year. The importance of the debenture issues has been gradually growing.
The last issue, for Rs 90 million, was made in June, 1974, at 6-1/4% (com-
pared to 6% for the previous issues) and had a term of 12 years. It was
oversubscribed. Some 54% of all the debenture issues have been taken up by
comercial banks, 32% by financial institutions and 14% by private institu-
tions and individuals, mostly ICICI's clients. Though ICICI's effort in
helping develop the financial markets by floating these debentures is laud-
able, little actual mobilization of primary savings is generated in this
process. ICICI, like other financial institutions, is mostly tapping
resources which have already been mobilized by commercial banks and other
institutions (primarily insurance companies). This is, however, the result
of traditional investment habits and the lack of secondary markets for deben-
tures, which are major obstacles to attracting funds directly from the public.
Also, RBI controls all debenture issues by determining amounts, maturity and
rates of interest, thus limiting ICICI from making the yield on its deben-
tures more attractive.
4.03      Its increasing reliance on debenture issues for its local currency
resource needs has created some problems for ICICI. It had rupee resources
of Rs 98.2 million available for commitment as of December 31, 1974 (Annex 19).
However, it had to forego some business in the past two years, and to increase
its joint financing with other institutions (especially IDBI) on account of
a shortage of local resources.  ICICI has found it increasingly difficult
to obtain subscriptions for its debenture issues from commercial banks and
institutional investors, because they are not classified as trustee securities
under the Indian Trust Act of 1882.  This has meant that commercial banks
and institutional investors have not been able to include their investments
in ICICI clebentures to meet their reserve ratio requirements, which in the
present period of tight money are extremely burdensome. The latest issue
was oversubscribed because of ICICI's strong efforts in attracting investors
including the offering of a small portion of ICICI's equity portfolio (at
market prices) to potential purchasers in exchange for debenture subscription.
ICICI has asked GOI to reclassify its debentures as trustee securities. This
would greatly increase their attractiveness among commercial banks and
financial institutions. ICICI anticipates a positive reaction.1l/ ICICI
intends to approach the market twice a year (instead of once as it presently
does) to raise additional rupee resources.  However, in view of the import-
ant role ICICI plays in efficiently allocating local resources (as well as
foreign currency) and the growing emergence of the Indian capital goods
industry, there is a need, in the longer-term, for ICICI to increase its
mobilization of local currency. 2/  ICICI's long term strategy for raising
1/   Recently, the GOI passed an Ordinance permitting  .UTI's trust certificates
to be classified as trustee securities for purposes of investment by
private trust.
21   Annex 18 para 13 discusses ICICI's present role in domestic currency
financing.

local currency funds was discussed during negotiations. Aside from its
traditional sources (loan collecting, share capital, internal cash generation),
ICICI expects to emphasize larger and more frequent debenture issues.
Foreign Currency
4.04      The bulk of ICICI's foreign currency resources (Annex 21) have come
from IBRD. Of total foreign exchange resources of $242 million as of
December 31, 1974, ten IBRD loans account for $201 million or 83%. Thirteen
KfW lines of credit account for 10% and five UK lines of credit for 6%; the
balance of 1% was provided by one AID line of credit, and a recent Swiss
bond issue. 1/ The Swiss bond issue for SF 8 million ($2.1 million) was
floated during 1973 at a fixed rate of 8% and was the first of its kind
for ICICI. Though the amount was modest, it represented an important step
in diversifying ICICI's sources of foreign exchange. ICICI had also envisaged
obtaining a $15 million Euro-currency loan which was never finalized because
of rising borrowing costs and increasing uncertainties in the Euro-dollar
market. ICICI is keen to diversify its sources of foreign currency funds,
a policy, which the Bank has encouraged and entirely supports. However, in
view of the difficult monetary situation worldwide, ICICI was unable, in the
short term, to mobilize new foreign commercial funds at a cost acceptable
to GOI or to ICICI's borrowers. During negotiations, ICICI's plans for
foreign commercial resource mobilization were discussed. The Bank stressed
that ICICI would have to reduce significantly its reliance on Bank financing
in the future. ICICI's efforts in this regard are promising. Starting in
1975, ICICI expects to be able to raise between $15-25 million in foreign
exchange resources in the Middle East (Kuwait) at a reasonable cost (para
7.06). Preliminary discussions have already started, and GOI is strongly
backing ICICI in its attempt to tap this market. ICICI is also exploring
the possibility of raising funds from the US Eximbank.
Mobilization at Project Level
4.05      Though ICICI's share in financing the total cost of projects varies
from case to case, a typical project in ICICI's portfolio would involve
financing by ICICI of about 20% of the total capital costs (about two-thirds
1/   In addition, a loan of DM 7 million from KfW has recently been sanctioned
and is expected to become effective shortly. ICICI's foreign resource
requirements in relation to its present resource position and projected
operations are discussed in para 7.05.



- 18 -
of it in foreign exchange). 1/ Some 60% of the cost would be financed by
the promoters' contributions and internally generated funds, and the balance
by other sources. This would mean that every rupee equivalent invested by
ICICI would generate 4 rupees of additional investment in the economy. Joint
financing activities by ICICI with other Indian financial institutions are
very common. During the last two years, some 65% by value of ICICI's approvals
were for joint financing operations. In these operations, one institution
generally becomes the "lead bank" depending on its particular expertise; ICICI
has thus led joint financing operations in many cases, particularly for pro-
jects in the modern industrial sector. ICICI has also participated in joint
ventures with foreign financial institutions such as IFC, CDFC, and DEG for
some 26 projects involving a total capital cost of over $300 million; ICICI
took the lead in about 18 of them.  Thus, ICICI has played an important role
as a catalyst for investment.
4.06      Other indirect contributions ICICI has made to resource mobil-
ization in India are its pioneering role in underwriting share capital (Annex
18, para 5), its merchant banking activities (Annex 18, para 8) and arrangement
of technical and financial collaboration with foreign institutions (para 3.11).
V. DEVELOPMENTAL IMPACT
Special Study
5.01      In 1972, a Joint Study of ICICI's developmental impact was launched
as a combined effort by the Bank and ICICI. The Study's objectives were
(a) estimating through an appropriate sample the economic rate of return for
projects in ICICI's portfolio; (b) appreciating the factors responsible for
the economic quality of ICICI's portfolio, including those deriving from
the policies and practices of ICICI itself as well as those stemming from
objectivet circumstances and government policies; and (c) deepening the
understanding of ICICI's role in resource mobilization, both directly
and through its influence on its clients, given prevailing conditions,
policies and institutions in the country.
5.02      TIhe core of the study involved the calculation of ex-post economic
rates of return for 42 projects financed by ICICI selected on a broadly-
based sample basis but where a full year of production had taken place.
Unlike similar DFC studies of this type, this portion was utndertaken solely
by ICICI, though the Bank assisted in formulating the economic methodology
and agreed on the terms of reference.
1/   A typical ICICI project is likely to show an import content of about 30%
in initial investment.  One fourth of the raw materials consumed during
prod&uction are likely to be imported; however on the output side, it is
likely to make a significant contribution to import replacement.  An
ex-ante calculation of the domestlic resource cost per unit of foreign
exchanged earned/saved for 39 projects recently approved by ICICI,
indicates that only 13 had DRCs of over 8.5 (Annex 22, Attachment 3).



- 19 -
5.03      The Study was completed in mid-1973, and the results showed, after
excluding a large pharmaceutical project which had a high negative economic
rate of return, a weighted average economic rate of return (ERR) of 19.3%
and a weighted average financial rate of return of 17.5%. Subsequent tests
showed the results were highly sensitive to changes in international prices
as well as the level of the shadow wage rate. The results point up a
satisfactory return on that particular sample of ICICI's portfolio, though
it was not possible in the absence of additional data to compare these
returns with overall industrial averages. Overall, the Study showed that
ICICI's performance has generally been good.
5.04      Since the Study, ICICI has continued to undertake such analyses for
projects and loans above a certain amount using the methodology described in
Annex 22 that is identical to the one used in the Study. On the basis of an
analysis of 39 projects (ex ante), the weighted average ERR has been 20.3%
and the weighted average financial rate of return 14.0%. None of the project
had ERRs of less than 8%, while 18 had ERRs in excess of 20%. Thus, the more
recent ex ante analyses have been reasonably consistent with the ex post
results and reinforce the conclusion of the Special Study.
Contribution to Exports
5.05      ICICI's contribution to the export performance of the Indian manu-
facturing sector through its direct finance assistance to its clients can be
measured in a variety of ways. To begin with, it is estimated that about 55%-
60% by number of ICICI-financed companies exported part of their output,
though only about 4% of total output is actually exported.
5.06      However, ICICI's contribution to manufactured exports is much
greater in those industries in which it is particularly active. For
example, 89% of total rubber product exports in 1972 were accounted for by
ICICI companies (Annex 23) as well as 45% for electrical machinery and 42%
for metal manufacturers. Overall, in that year ICICI clients contributed
17.7% of total Indian exports of manufacturers for selected commodity
groups.
5.07      Utilizing data for ICICI clients, where available, for both 1972
and 1973, total exports increased in 1973 by 22% (Annex 24). The largest
increase was recorded by the textile sector. With the continual changes
in the relation between international and domestic prices, the potential
for exports by the Indian manufacturing sector should continue to increase.
However, a basic review of the export potential is required to ensure that
once the domestic market has been satisfied, export opportunities are fully
exploited. Since ICICI has continued to finance only those projects with
sufficiently attractive economic rates of return, its project selection, even
within the confines of the GOI's licensing system, has contributed to the
expansion of those industries which have at least some potential for export.



- 20 -
During negotiations, ICICI agreed to prepare a detailed study on the prob-
lems and prospects for manufactured exports on the basis of a sample survey
of its clients. The terms of reference for the study will be finalized in
the course of a Bank mission to India in April.
EApOlyem t Generation
5.08      Data for direct employment are available for 363 ICICI assisted
companies. Growth in employment in these companies in FY73 (from 613,000 to
634,000) was slightly faster than the growth of employment in the private
manufacturing sector which grew from 4.78 million in 1971 to 4.84 million in
1973. The aggregate investment/employment ratio in nominal terms was found
to be Rs 32,890 in FY73 compared to Rs 30,950 in the previous year and
Rs 16,500 for the entire industrial sector in 1968. The relatively high
average ratio for the ICICI sample is due to the capital intensive nature
of the non-traditional industries which were heavily represented in the
sample, such as chemical and petro-chemical industries.
Assistance to Backward Areas
5.09      In line with GOI objectives, ICICI has continued to put increasing
emphasis on lending to backward areas. As of June 30, 1974, it had lent
Rs 815 million to 154 enterprises for the establishment of 207 projects, with
a total capital cost of Rs 6.9 billion. This assistance has been spread over
62 of the 225 districts and seven union territories which GOI has designated
as backward. Of greater significance, however, is the trend over the past
five years of this kind of assistance. Specifically, up until the end of 1969,
only 12.9% of ICICI's total approvals had gone to backward areas. However,
this has gradually increased, and in the first half of 1974, 45.6% went to
backward areas (Annex 25), while on a cumulative basis, 17.3% of approvals
had gone to backward areas. However, GOI's classification of backward areas
has changed somewhat over the years, which distorts results to some extent.
Moreover, a significant portion of ICICI's assistance has been in the backward
districts of advanced states.
5.10      The improving geographical diversification in ICICI's assistance
can be attributable to its increasing emphasis on project promotion through
the financing of feasibility studies, contacts at Inter-International Group
(IIG) levels and the provision of concessionary financing as well as the
GOI's stepped up efforts to provide financial incentives to projects in
backward areas. ICICI's assistance should continue to grow in future in
these aretas.
Assistance to Small Scale Industries
5.11      Historically, ICICI's assistance to small scale industries has been
nominal 0mostly in foreign currency) with only Rs 16.6 million in approvals
represent;ing only 0.4% of its total approvals, as of June 30, 1974. Over



- 21 -
the past four years there has been a decline in assistance from Rs 2.6 million
in 1970/71 to Rs 1.2 million in 1973/74 since IDA has recently made a credit
to the State Financial Corporations which specialize in medium and small scale
industry. It would not be necessary for ICICI to continue to finance this type
of business, since the SFCs have much greater expertise in the field and are
much better situated through location and branches to cater to the particular
needs of the small scale sector.
Promotion
5.12      During negotiations of the tenth Bank loan, ICICI undertook to
increase its promotional role by identifying new projects and entrepreneurs,
particularly in backward areas. In the past, its promotional role has consisted
largely of: (a) training of local development bank staff from the SIDCs and
SFCs, (b) participation in industrial surveys conducted throughout India from
which new project ideas have emerged, (c) coordination and cooperation with
both State and All-India institutions through inter-institutional group
meetings; and (d) supporting technical consultancy services centers such as
NEITCO. 1/
5.13      In a significant step, ICICI established a Project Promotion De-
partment in late 1973 to act as the nucleus of its project promotion efforts.
The Department was expected to focus on the identification of projects which
would have linkages with existing industrial units, would fill identifiable
gaps in the industrial sector, would be of long term significance to indus-
try, would be located in a backward area and would be conceived by new or
relatively new entrepreneurs. To date, the Department has generated four
new project ideas of which two are more advanced; a sand beneficiation project
and an industrial estate in West Bengal for small scale industry. The staff
of the Department consists only of four people, Z/ though this should grow as
business develops (para 3.04). The staff have already visited four states
(Gujarat, Andhrah Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal) in order to
review with local authorities the prospects of new projects. 3/
5.14      ICICI receives some financial assistance from KfW for promotional
work in the form of interest rebates on its loans which amounted to Rs 7.74
million as of June 30, 1974 (split 50-50 between loans and grants) of which
Rs 5.05 million still remains to be utilized. The grants have been used
largely to finance expenditures in a variety of institutes of financial

Organization.
2/   Though augmented by the staff of other Departments as needed.
3/   ICICI's proposal for the establishment of a housing development finance
corporation along with insurance companies, commercial banks and other
institutions has been dropped on account of GOI opposition to a proposal
which would promote the construction of medium income housing.

management, while part of the loans received have gone to finance an equity
subscription (Rs 0.02 million) in NEITCO.
5.15      ICICI has made a promising beginning in the promotional area, though
there is still plenty of scope for increased activity, particularly as the
staff of the Project Promotion Department grows in size and experience. More-
over, ICICI's promotional activities should be enhanced when more effective
use is made of the Regional Offices (para 3.07).
Relations with Government
5.16      From its inception, ICICI has maintained an independent though
effective and mutually advantageous relationship with GOI, which has both
provided and guaranteed funds, while ICICI, particularly through its success-
ful mobilization of scarce foreign exchange, has been in a position to
implement effectively many GOI policy objectives (para 2.11). The opportunity
for close dialogue exists because of the two GOI directors on ICICI's Board.
Moreover, ICICI's management attends numerous GOI meetings in Delhi on
industrial questions. Since 1973, ICICI has been represented on the Capital
Goods Committee (para 2.14) where it provides a valuable input to decision-
making particularly in the case of complex projects using advanced tech-
nologies. To increase the dialogue and ensure closer liaison, ICICI proposes
to establish a regional office in Delhi (para 3.08). It is anticipated that
ICICI's export study (para 5.07) should provide the GOI with valuable insights
into the problems and prospects of manufactured exports.
Relations with Financial Institutions and Clients
5.17      ICICI maintains close contact with the other All-India institutions
particularly through joint financing, and the setting of lending terms.
ICICI also maintains contact with state level institutions through its
participation at IIG meetings and through the training of their staff. 1/
ICICI maintains a reputation for high quality and efficient work amongst
the business community. In the past, ICICI has been very influential in
shaping investment proposals (by providing cost estimates, appropriate product
mixes, technological improvements, etc.) as well as assisting clients to
arrange technical and financial collaboration agreements with foreign partners.

development banks both in India and other countries; and deputation of

VI. FINANCIAL RECORD AND POSITION
Earnings Record
6.01      ICICI's profitability in nominal termsl/ remains satisfactory.
Income statements from 1970 through 1974 are given in Annex 26. During 1974
net income rose by 7% to Rs 26.6 million compared to Rs 25.0 million in
1973 and Rs 23.3 million in 1972. However, return on average equity
decreased from 11.7% in 1972 to 10.7% in 1973, and 10.1% in 1974, mainly
because of the Rs 25 million increase in share capital in 1973 and in 1974,
to a reduction in income from equity investments which resulted from the
adverse capital market conditions (para 2.35). ICICI's gross income derives
mostly from its lending operations. During 1974, income from foreign cur-
rency loans accounted for 67% of gross income (versus 65% in 1973, and 61%
in 1972) and income from rupee loans and debentures for 23% (versus 21% in
1973 and 23% in 1972). The increase in the proportion of income from
foreign currency loans is due to their more rapid disbursements. The table
below summarizes ICICI's income relative to average total assets.
1971     1972      1973     1974
.......... ...,,,,percent........
Income:  Income from loans                 6.8       7.1       7.7      8.1

Profit before tax and provisions            2.8      2.7       2.6       2.3
6.02      Besides the increase in income from loans discussed above, this
table also shows a relative increase in financial expenses. Borrowing costs
on foreign lines of credit disbursed, including World Bank loans, have been
gradually rising and the spread on lending operations has declined from 3.1%
in 1970 to 2.9% in 1973. However, as a percentage of average total assets,
income from loans (net of financial expenses) has remained the same. The
1/   When reviewing ICICI's financial record and position, it should be borne
in mind that figures are given at current prices and do not reflect the
impact of inflation. On the income side, as ICICI's major sources of
revenues and expenses come from foreign currency operations, and as
ICICI lends at a positive spread, inflation does not pose too much
of a threat. On the other hand, from the point of view of ICICI's
capital structure, inflation adversely affects the growth in share
capital and retained earnings vis-a-vis the foreign currency assets
and liabilities (para 6.11).



- 24 -
overall lower profitability is due to a reduction in dividend income and
capital gains, a result of the bad economic and capital market conditions.
Also, administrative expenses increased by 32% during 1973 in view partly
to the new hirings but mainly to administrative costs resulting from the
Swiss bond issue. Nevertheless, these expenses remained quite low at 0.5%
of average total assets, reflecting ICICI's effective cost controls. During
1974, administrative expenses increased by 1O% (0.5% of average total assets).
Despite the somewhat reduced profitability, its earnings record has remained
adequate.. Increases in lending rates (para 3.10) will permit ICICI to
preserve it at that level. ICICI has been paying a 10% annual dividend
per share, and has maintained a dividend payout ratio of about 40%, thus
being abLe to add some 60% of its net earnings to reserves. In view of the
new dividend ordinance, introduced by GOI in 1974 (para 2.16) ICICI will be
able to strengthen its reserves even more each year, by ploughing back an
additional proportion of its yearly net profits. 1/
Quality of Portfolio
6.03      Loans.  The repayment performance of ICICI's clients has remained
good, with collections comprising about 90% of amounts falling due. As of
June 30, 1974, 53 companies (out of 850) were in arrears. The total principal
outstanding on these loans was Rs 109.7 million or 6.8% of the total loan
portfolio. The principal in arrears comprised 1.7% of the outstanding loan
portfolio. The trend in arrears remains favorable. The percentage of the
loan portfolio affected by arrears has been decreasing from 12.4% as of
December 31, 1970 to 8.9%, 8.2%, 7.1% and 6.8% as of December 31, 1971, 1972,
1973 and June 30, 1974, respectively (Annex 27). ICICI has continued to re-
schedule loans where appropriate, and usually enforces a tight new repayment
schedule to maintain pressure on its clients to clear their accounts. Even
when including these reschedulings into the portfolio analysis, the trends
remain favorable. 2/ Annex 28 shows the characteristics of ICICI's loans in
arrears.
6.04      The good condition of the loan portfolio not only reflects the
adequate profitability of its clients (Annex 18, para 18) but also the high
standards of ICICIts appraisal and follow-up work.  Its management watches
closely all delinquent projects and tries to help in solving their diffi-
culties, for instance by seeking a strengthening of management (including
1/   This would mean that ICICI would pay dividends of about 7.1% of share
capital during 1974 and 7.2% in 1975 to achieve the maximum dividend
payout of 33%.
2/   If the principal outstanding of loans rescheduled were added to the
principal outstanding affected by arrears, the proportion of the port-
folio affected by arrears would have been: 1970: 16.6%; 1971: 16.7%;
1972:  12.2%; 1973: 10.1%; 1974: 8.7%; see Annex 27.

the appointment of directors to a borrower's board - para 3.12), the input
of additional capital or the reorganization of capital structure. As of
June 30, 1974, only 6 cases, involving overdues of Rs 4.2 million, and debt
outstanding of Rs 13 million, were under litigation. Loans outstanding
considered doubtful were estimated at less than Rs 15 million. However,
ICICI's loans are well secured and losses are expected to be minimal. In
any event, its reserves against doubtful debts, of Rs 18.5 million as of
June 30, 1974 (1.1% of the loan portfolio), are adequate to cover any
eventual loss.
6.05      Investments.  As of June 30, 1974, ICICI's investment portfolio
amounted to Rs 335.1 million. Of these, Rs 105.7 million (32%), represented
common share investments in 193 companies; Rs 86.4 million (26%), preferred
share investments in 129 companies, and Rs 143.0 million, (42%), debenture
holdings in 64 companies. In addition, ICICI held temporary investments of
Rs 15.2 million, comprising mostly Government securities and debentures but
also a Rs 1.9 million contribution to IRCI's (Annex 9) share capital. Some
86% of all these investments are quoted on the stock exchange.
6.06      ICICI's debenture portfolio is good.  Debenture investments have
mainly been in first rate industrial concerns. The average annual yield
on all debentures (new and old) over the last two years has been 7.7%. After
the recent rise in its lending rates (para 3.10), ICICI also proposes an
increase in the yield for new debentures from 8-1/2% and 9% (for public
issues and privately placed, respectively) to 10% and 10-1/2% 1/. The
higher rates would make debenture investments more attractive, and improve
their marketability in secondary markets (Annex 18, para 5). The recent
dividend ordinance (para 2.16) may also make debenture investments more
attractive.
6.07      The condition of ICICI's equity investment portfolio is illustrated
in Annex 29. The average market value of ICICI's holding of quoted common
shares 2/ was 132% higher than their book value as of June 30, 1974. As
of that date, 51% of the common share investments were in companies operat-
ing profitably, 16% were in companies under construction, and the balance
of 33% were in companies having financial or technical difficulties, of
which about Rs 3 million (3% of the common share portfolio) was in some
jeopardy. The preference share portfolio, though also adequate, is not of
as good a quality. As of June 30, 1974, some 37% of that portfolio was in
companies operating profitably; 17% in companies under construction, and
46% in companies facing difficulties. About Rs 1.5 million, or 2% of the
preferred shares portfolio, was in some jeopardy. Including common and
preferred shares, possible losses on the equity investment portfolio thus
amounted to about Rs 4.5 million. ICICI makes no specific provisions for
its equity investments, but the net capital gain realized from the sale of
1/   For debentures with maturities longer than seven years, the respective
figures are 10-1/2% and 11%.
2/   Quoted common shares comprise 89% of the common share portfolio.



- 26 -
investments is earmarked to a capital reserve fund which was Rs 34.2 million
as of Juae 30, 1974. This is an adequate cushion against the need for any
write-off or deterioration in investments.
6.08      The dividend yield on equity investments was 3.4% in 1974, compared
to 4.2% in 1973, 4.8% in 1972, 4.2% in 1971, and 3.6% in 1970.  ICICI
realized capital gains before tax of Rs 4.6 million in 1974 (58% profit)
Rs 7.6 million in 1973 (46% profit), and Rs 6.8 million in 1972 (32% profit).
Taking dividends and capital gains together, the average yield on the equity
portfolio was 5.5% in 1974, 8% in 1973 and 8.8% in 1972 and 1971. The
reduced return on the equity portfolio during 1973 and 1974 is due to a
more conservative dividend policy by companies due to the liquidity squeeze.
Nevertheless, ICICI's equity portfolio continues to be sound. ICICI's
investment policies are directly supervised by its Chairman who had valuable
experience in investment operations before joining ICICI. He is assisted by
a staff committee.
Financial Position
6.09      General.  As discussed above, ICICI's profitability (in nominal
terms) arnd the quality of its portfolio remain satisfactory. The liquidity
position is somewhat tight but remains adequate. Cash flow statements for
1970 through 1974 are in Annex 30. ICICI follows a policy of matching the
maturities of its borrowings with the maturities of the loans in its
portfolio. The debt service coverage, at 1.2 times during 1974 has thus
been sufficient. As of December 31, 1974 ICICI's net working capital
exceeded undisbursed rupee commitments by 15%. The somewhat strained
liquidity position will continue through 1975 but is expected to improve
thereafter (para 7.09).
6.10      Balance sheets from 1970 are summarized in Annex 31.  During 1974
ICICI's loan and investment portfolio grew by 14%, the same rate as in
1972 and 1973. Total assets during the same period increased by 10%,
compared with 16% in 1972 and 10% in 1971. ICICI's long-term debt outstanding
as of December 31, 1974 was Rs 2.0 billion, of which Rs 1.0 billion ($142
million) consisted of IBRD loans outstanding. The latter represents 50% of
ICICI's loan and investment portfolio, and 44% of its total assets. Reserves
and retained earnings reached Rs 146.4 million at December 31, 1974, account-
ing for 7% of the loan and investment portfolio. Some Rs 22.0 million, or
15%, of these reserves have been earmarked to cover doubtful debts 1/ and
are presently adequate for this purpose (para 6.04).
1/   These reserves against doubtful debts provide for possible losses on
principal repayments; they are not passed through the revenue/expense
accounts but allocated directly in the balance sheets as reserves.
Prior to 1973, doubtful interest income was included in the revenue
accounts and a provision was made as an expense against their recovery.
For the 1973 and 1974 accounts this doubtful interest income is not
accrued as income, but added directly to current assets in the balance
sheets against a current liability account called "interest in suspense".
This "interest in suspense" procedure has been adopted to avoid payment
of tax on income that might not be realized (provisions are not deducti-
ble in India).



- 27 -
6.11      During negotiations, ICICI requested that the limitation on its
debt equity ratio be raised. The ratio had been deteriorating because of
the weakening position of the rupee vis-a-vis non-sterling currencies. If
calculated at current exchange rates the ratio stood at 8.5:1 at December 31,
1974 (including as equity the Rs 25 million share capital paid in January,
1975). The situation could deteriorate further if there was a continuation
in adverse exchange fluctuations, and also because limitations on dividends
imposed by the GOI Ordinance (paras 2.16, 2.35), could render difficult the
completion of ICICI's projected share capital increase in 1976 (para 7.07).
However, despite the good condition of ICICI's portfolio and the quality of
its management, it would be undesirable to change the present limit on
ICICI's long term capital structure, particularly because ICICI's debt
service coverage, though adequate, does not leave, enough of a cushion if
for circumstances beyond ICICI's and its clients' control, collection per-
formance deteriorated. It was therefore understood during negotiations,
that ICICI will go ahead with its present program for increasing share
capital, and that the debt/equity limit remain at 9:1. 1/
6.12      Market Quotation.  The book value of ICICI's own shares as of
December 31, 1974 was about 2.2 times the par value of Rs 100. The market
price during the first half of 1974 ranged from Rs 90 to Rs 118 per share,
or about 42% to 55% of the book value. ICICI's shares have traditionally
been priced below book value, and little trading takes place. At the
closing price of Rs 90 at December 1974, ICICI's dividend yield amounted to
9.9% and the price/earnings ratio to 4.6:1. The fact that ICICI's price
is below par reflects the poor stock market conditions.
6.13      Audit.  N. M. Raiji & Co. (Bombay) and Ray & Ray (Calcutta) con-
tinue to be ICICI's auditors.  None of their audit reports on ICICI has
been qualified. As agreed during negotiations for the 10th Bank loan,
beginning with the 1973 accounts, ICICI has started submitting reports on
its accounts in the required "long form." The accounts for ICICI's foreign
currency assets and liabilities have in the past been kept at central
exchange rates. ICICI has confirmed that its auditors would be asked to
verify ICICI's foreign currency assets and liabilities as of December 31,
1974 at the then prevailing (floating) exchange rates. Thereafter, it is
expected that the audited accounts will provide this information.
VII. PROSPECTS
General
7.01      In response to the unfavorable economic performance in the recent
past, GOI has taken a number of economic policy measures to ameliorate the
1/   However, the current portion of long-term debt would not be included
as debt for purposes of calculation of the ratio since this does not
affect the long-term capital structure, and ICICI is not involved in
short-term operations.

situation. Recent actions, discussed earlier, such as simplification of
licensing procedures, no drastic cuts of imports of essential industrial
inputs, flexibility towards price increases in a number of industrial com-
modities, and handling of strikes, should stimulate private industrial pro-
duction and investment. It is yet too early to quantify the impact of
these policies on the overall growth of the industrial sector. 1/ However,
recent data on licenses granted and Capital Goods (CG) clearances (para
2.14) show increasing investment interest, particularly in the sectors in
which ICICI is most active, most of which have continued to perform well. 2/
In light of these developments, a continued growth in ICICI's operations is
expected. ICICI is aware of the important contribution it can make in this
adjustment process and has outlined its financing priorities over the next
few years in line with GOI policies. Annex 32 shows ICICI's statement of
financing priorities which was discussed with IBRD at negotiations and
reviewed by GOI and ICICI's Board.
7.02      On the other hand, there are severe problems still facing the
industrial sector, such as inflation, substantial unutilized capacity in many
industries due to shortages of raw materials, transport, and power, as opposed
to lack of demand for product output. In addition, the general prospects of
the economy rest on uncontrollable factors such as the behavior of the
monsoon.   In the context of this uncertainty, ICICI's proven capability
in financing high return, economically viable projects, with a good record
of capacity utilization, many of which are export oriented is sufficient
evidence that it would continue to allocate Bank funds efficiently under
the new loan.
Business Forecasts
7.03      ICICI has estimated that its total approvals, which were Rs 627
million in 1974, will increase by 13% annually to Rs 1040 million in 1978.
Foreign currency loans are projected to grow by about 9% per annum during
this periLod. In view of the prevailing inflation (para 2.04), these growth
rates imply that in real terms, ICICI will not maintain its present level
of operations. ICICI's caution in these projections appears appropriate,
in view of the uncertainty still surrounding the future course of the Indian
economy.
1/   The Fifth Five-Year Plan, which was expected to commence on April 1,
1974 anticipated industrial investment in the private sector over the
five years of Rs 62 billion, a significant increase over the previous
one,. It was expected that industry (public and private) would grow at
an annual rate of 8.1% against the 5.5% target in the previous Plan.
The substantial impact of the energy _risis in India caused the new Plan
to be discarded and completely reworked under new assumptions. New
growth rates are not yet available.
2/ Annex 18, para 18 also shows that the financial performance of ICICIts
clients continues to be good.



- 29 -
7.04      Annex 33 shows ICICI's forecast of approvals, commitments and
disbursements from 1975 through 1978. Approvals and commitments of foreign
currency loans in 1975, Rs 385 million and Rs 443 million respectively, are
largely based on projects ICICI presently has in its pipeline. The large
level of commitments in 1975 is because foreign resource constraints required
ICICI to substantially curtail commitments during the last six months. This
situation would be corrected after the proposed loan becomes effective. Over
the projected four years, foreign currency loan approvals are expected to be
Rs 1.9 billion ($259 million), accounting for about 55% of total approvals
during that period. Local currency financing is expected to reach Rs 1.5
billion and to account for 45% of the total, compared with 41% in the previous
five years.   The trend towards an increasing proportion of local currency
financing is thus expected to continue, and though in the most recent past,
the trend is partially explained by the squeeze in commercial bank credit,
the anticipated continuation of this trend in the future is on account of the
continuing development of the Indian capital goods industry. 1/ Despite the
present market conditions underwriting and equity investments are projected
to increase again and to account for 35% of total local currency activities
(compared with 28% for the period since 1971). This recovery in the
importance of its investments reflects ICICI's continued interest in contri-
buting to the development of the capital market, and is based on an expect-
ation that the present downturn in the stock market due primarily to the
divided ordinance (para 2.16) will be temporary, and should not affect
long-term investment interest.
Resource Requirements
7.05      Foreign.  ICICI's uncommitted foreign currency resources at December
31, 1974 were $15 million. ICICI plans to continue its slowdown in commit-
ments during the first half of 1975 and to exhaust these resources by July,
1975 when the proposed loan would become effective. Por the two year period
starting July 1, 1975, ICICI's resource situation would be as follows:

recent years.

7.06      As shown above, ICICI's foreign resource gap for the two years
from about the time the proposed loan is expected to become effective is
about $100 million. A Bank loan for this amount would meet about 70% of
ICICI's requirement over this period. The balance would be provided by
traditional sources of funds for ICICI such as KfW and UK lines of credit,
and also from Middle East borrowings. Annex 34 shows ICICI's projected
foreign currency resource position from 1975 through 1978, and illustrates
ICICI's intention to further diversify its foreign currency resources to
avoid undue reliance on IBRD (para 4.04).
7.07      Domestic.  ICICI's projected rupee resource position for 1975
to 1978 is given in Annex 34. For this period, disbursements for local
currency loans and investments are expected to be Rs 1,229 million. The
total rupee requirements, Rs 1,649 million, are expected to be funded by
debenture issues and GOI borrowings (47%), loan collections (2%), IDBI
counterpatrt funds for the UK credits (9%), internal cash generation (6%),
sales from portfolio (6%) and share capital (4%). The balance of 6% is
expected to be financed from ICICI's resources on hand from previous bor-
rowings. ICICI expects to increase its reliance on its own debenture issues
as the major source of its rupee ftuds, Tt intends to go to the market
twice a year instead of once as previously) to raise funds through debentures,
and is striving for the reclassification of these as trustee securities,
to make them more attractive (para 4.03). Nevertheless, the projected
resource position still shows a steady declne, in view of the increased
local currency financing (para 7.04). This implies that there might be a
need for ICICI to use IDBI's refinance facility, if its domestic currency
financing is to be increased as projected.

Financial Projections
7.08      Projected income statements for 1975 to 1978 are shown in Annex 35.
Net profits after tax are expected to grow steadily from Rs 26.6 million in
1974 to Rs 47.4 million in 1978, or by 15% per year. lhowever, the return
on average net worth will remain at around 10% in view of capital increases
of Rs 25 million in 1975, 1976 and 1977. 1/ The overall profitability will
remain satisfactory. The recent increases in lending rates will offset
increasing borrowing costs2/, and thus the spread for lending operations
will be around 2.8%. Administrative expenses have been projected to grow
by 14% per annum and to remain at 0.5Z of average total assets. The
projected growth in administrative expenses might be underestimated in view
of inflation and of increasing involvement in promotion and expansion of thle
regional offices. NIevertheless, the present level is sufficiently low such
that a larger increase would not substantially affect profitability. The
projected dividend rate would be 6.8% of share capital in 1975, in view of
the recent dividend ordinance (para 6.02). Afterwards, ICICI expects to
return to its normal payout of about 40%, reflecting a dividend rate of about
10% on share capital.
7.09      Projected balance sheets and cash flow statements for 1975-78
are shown in Annexes 36 and 37. Total assets are forecasted to grow
from Rs 2,339.8 million at the end of 1974 to Rs 3,897.2 million in
1978, an annual growth rate of 14% per year. The loan and investment port-
folio is projected to go up by about 14% per year from Rs 2,080.6 million
in 1974 to Rs 3,512.9 million in 1978. The outstanding long-term debt would
increase from Rs 1,950.1 million in 1974 to Rs 3,250.2 million in 1978 (14%
annual growth), while net worth would increase from Rs 273.2 million to
Rs 450.9 million. This increase in equity includes an annual appropriation
of Rs 3.5 million to reserve against doubtful debts, which by 1978 would
amount to Rs 36 million, or 1.2% of the projected loan portfolio. The debt/
equity ratio (Bank definition)3/ will fluctuate between 8.0:1 and 8.3:1
throughout the projected period, below the contractual limit of 9:1, thus
permitting ICICI to expand its operations. However, to remain at the above
debt/equity levels, ICICI would have to increase its share capital as pro-
jected (para 7.08). The increases in share capital are, in any case, neces-
sary to provide an adequate cushion If there is a sudden deterioration in
collections. Liquidity is expected to remain satisfactory, though the cash
position would decrease in view of the local resource constraints (para 7.07)
bringing the current ratio down to 1.7:1 in 1978. This is due to an increase
in expected local currency operations and not to debt servicing capacity.
1/   These include the balance of the November, 1973, share issue which was
paid in January, 1975, and one more issue of Rs 50 million in 1976, of
which Rs 25 million is assumed to be paid-up in 1976 and the balance in
1977.
2/   Foreign currency lending rates are expected to increase again to offset
IBRD's increase (para 2.33).
3/   At floating (not central) exchange rates but excluding the portion of
long-term debt maturing with a year.



- 32 -
Debt service coverage is expected to decline to 1.06 times in 1975, when
ICICI expects to redeem a Rs 60 million debenture issue, but thereafter
would recover to the previous level of 1.3 times. The overall financial
position of ICICI is expected to remain satisfactory. Annex 38 shows the
estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed loan.

ANNEX 6

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OF INDIA (IDBI)
Origins
1.        IDBI was established in 1964 as a subsidiary of RBI to function
as the apex development bank to coordinate the activities and extend finance
to the other industrial term-lending institutions as well as provide direct
and indirect assistance to industrial units. IDBI is now the largest insti-
tutional source of individual finance (Annex 4).
Board of Directors
2.        Ihe members of IDBI's Board of Directors as of September 30, 1973
are shown in Attachment 1. Since June 1972, about half of the 18 members
of the Board, which is identical with RBI's, have changed, but the Board
continues to be broadly representative of business, professional and Govern-
ment circles. Nine directors including the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman
constitute the Executive Committee which is the highest decision-making
body for II)BI's day-to-day operations, including all investment decisions
(except for loans of smaller amounts which are approved at the management
level).
Management and Staff
3.        Mr. Chari continues to be the chief executive of IDBI.  Under him
are Messrs. C. S. Venkat Rao and B. N. Malhotra,the General Manager and the
Joint General Manager, respectively. Mr. Venkat Rao has been in the post
since September 1972.
4.        ])uring the 15-month period through September 1973, the total staff
strength increased from 612 to 754 and the number of professional staff from
229 to 272. More than half of the increase in professionals were used to
strengthen the three Regional Offices; within the Head Office, the Refinance
Department obtained the largest share of the increase. The new professionals
were mostly recruited from private-sector institutions. Only four professionals
left the service of IDBI during the period, including two who were seconded to
other organizations. IDBI continues to be active in training its staff; during
FY73, it sent 56 officers to training programs organized by various domestic
and foreign institutions, including the Bankers' Training College, Bombay and
the UN Asian Institute for Economic Development and Planning, Bangkok.
Resources
5.        IDBI's resource position as of December 31, 1973 is shown in
Attachment 2. of total long-term resources amounting to Rs 3,908 million,
share capital has remained at Rs 400 million since January 1972. The Gov-
ernment has discontinued its budgetary lending to IDBI since FY70, and
IDBI's lending since FY73 has been financed mainly by borrowings from RBI



ANNEX 6
Page 2
and bond issues. During the 18-month period through December 1973, IDBI
borrowed Rs 446 million from RBI's National Industrial Credit (Long Term
Operations) Fund. Maturities of RBI loans range from 12-1/4 years to 20
years, and the recent rates of interest from 3.5% to 6.5%, both depending
on the purpose of relending. IDBI issued a second series of 12-year, 5.75%
bonds in August 1972 for Rs 160 million, all of which was subscribed by 20
commercial banks. It plans another bond issue for Rs 165 million during
the second half of FY74.
6.        During FY73, RBI allocated Rs 300 million from its annual profits
to the Long Term Operations Fund, bringing the cumulative allocation to the
Fund to Rs 2,050 million, of which Rs 681 million was available for disburse-
ment to IDBI at end-December 1973.
Lending Policies and Practices
7.        Interest rates.  Following an increase in the Bank Rate in July
1974 (from 7% to 9% per annum), IDBI's lending rates were revised upward.
The new rates are shown in Attachment 3.
8.        Assistance to backward areas.  IDBI has since 1970 been providing
its direct and indirect assistance to projects located in the backward dis-
tricts on concessionary terms. Some modifications in IDBI's lending poli-
cies to these projects took place during FY73. With respect to its direct
assistance, the previous limit on the total cost of projects (up to Rs 30
million) which qualify for concessionary assistance was removed, and a new
limit was set on the aggregate amount of assistance provided by all national
term-lending institutions (up to Rs 20 million for loans and Rs 10 million
for underwritings), irrespective of the project cost. Likewise, with respect
to refinance, the eligibility criterion changed from the project cost to the
loan amount. Now, loans up to Rs 3 million each can benefit from IDBI's con-
cessionary refinance, provided the net worth of the enterprise does not ex-
ceed Rs 10 million.
Trends in Operations
9.        General.  A summary of IDBI's operations since FY71 is shown in
Attachment 4. After a rapid growth during FY71 and FY72, IDBI's business
volume somewhat declined in FY73. Total approvals for direct and indirect
assistance decreased from Rs 1,632 million in FY72 to Rs 1,417 million in
FY73. The main factors that contributed to the overall slowdown in business
were a decrease in direct project assistance (loans, investment and guaran-
tees to industrial units) which dropped by 13% during the year, and a sharp
contraction in export finance, the approvals of which fell to one-eighth of
the FY72 level. Decreases in these types of assistance more than offset the
significant increases in refinance and rediscounting business. On the other
hand, owing to time lags, both commitments and disbursements of IDBI assist-
ance continued to grow fast in FY73, reaching a new high of Rs 1,479 million



ANNEX 6
Page 3
,a 42% inc:ease over FY72) and Rs 1,066 million (13%), respectively.  Approv-
als for the first half of FY74 indicate that IDBI's business has recovered on
the whole to the FY72 level.
10.       Direct assistance to industry.  Approvals of direct project assist-
anice decreased from Rs 647 million in FY72 to Rs 535 million in FY73. On
the other hand, the number of projects financed increased from 25 in FY72
to 60 in FY73. The decline in the amount of assistance in FY73 appears to
have been a temporary slowdown; approvals for the first half of FY74 (Rs 260
million) showed a significant increase over the corresponding period of FY73
(Rs 67 million), and the pending applications as of end-December 1973 amount-
ed to over Rs 2,000 million. Since IDBI finances a relatively small number
of large projects, its annual approvals are prone to fluctuate. In addition,
as the lender of last resort, the volume of IDBI assistance depends on the
amounts taken up by other financial institutions.
In recent years, most of IDBI's direct assistance has been financed
from its General Fund. Since July 1972, only one loan (of Rs 10 million) has
been made from the Development Assistance Fund (DAF) which IDBI uses to fi-
nance risky projects with long gestation periods and large capital costs. As
of end-December 1973, IDBI had provided assistance from this Fund to four
projects totalling Rs 431 million, of which 89% represented loan financing.
12.       Refinance of industrial loans.  During FY73, IDBI refinanced 2,355
loans totalling Rs 327 million which were originally financed by SFCs and
covmmercial banks. This represents a 37% increase by number and a 19% growth
by amount over FY72. The momentum appears to continue in FY74. Between the
two groups of the recipients of IDBI refinance, the SFCs' share further in-
creased fromn 82% in FY72 to 92% in FY73. However, as a result of the recent
credit squeeze, an increasing number of applications have been received from
commercial banks since late 1973.
13.      _Rdiscounting of machinery bills.  This scheme is designed to
facilitate sales of indigenous machinery on a deferred-payment basis, with
IDBI rediscounting commercial paper originally discounted by other finan-
cial institutions. Bills and promissory notes rediscounted under the scheme
increased significantly from Rs 453 million in FY72 to Rs 498 million in FY73
and further to Rs 613 million for the first half of FY74 (on an annual basis).
As of end-FY73 machinery manufacturers who have benefitted from this facility
nuribered 361, and end-users of the machinery 1,659.
14.       Export finance.  IDBI's export finance, comprising direct loans
and guarantees to exporters of engineering goods, and refinance of such
loans made by commercial banks, decreased dramatically from Rs 227 million
in FY72 to Rs 28 million in FY73; this despite a 19% increase in India's
engineering exports during 1972/73.  Several events that took place during
the year contributed to the decline in export financing, including the un-
certainties prevailing on the international monetary scene (coupled with
a lack of longi-term exchange risk cover) and the suspension of new deferred-
payment contracts with some countries, although IDBI's export credits have



ANNEX 6
Page 4
recovered somewhat in 1973/74 to a level of Rs 106 million. Against this
background, the adoption by IDBI of an exchange risk cover scheme in June
1974 for export finance as well as the large pipeline of application sug-
gests that IDBI's export finance activities will grow in future.
15.       Investments in financial institutions.  During FY73, IDBI provided
long-term capital to five financial institutions for a total of Rs 28 million
(Rs 32 million during FY72). This includes subscriptions to the shares of
SFCs and IFCI, and to the debentures of ICICI. During the first half of FY74
similar assistance was given to three institutions totalling Rs 29 million.
Characteristics of Portfolio
16.       Breakdowns by industrial classification, geographical distribution
size of loans and investments, maturity of loans, nature of assisted proj-
ects, and type of clients, in respect of IDBI's direct assistance, refinance
and rediscounting approved between July 1968 and September 1973, are shown
in Attachment 5.
17.       Industrial distribution.  IDBI's direct assistance has been allo-
cated mainly to modern types of large industries, including fertilizers (23%),
iron and steel (17%), petro- and heavy-chemicals (15%), and paper and paper
products (12%). More than one-third of India's total capacity for fertil-
izer production was created with IDBI assistance, and so was about 40% of
its special steels and steel rolls production capacity. The distribution
of IDBI refinance shows a relatively heavy concentration on traditional
lines of industries such as light chemicals (13%), food manufacturing (13%),
textiles (10%), and road transport (10%), but some new types of industries,
including machine manufacturing (12%) and metal products (9%) are also taking
on an increasing importance. The machinery sold under the IDBI rediscounting
scheme went mostly to the textile (51%) and machine manufacturing (25%) in-
dustries.
18.       Geographical distribution.  Reflecting the imbalances of indus-
trialization among States, IDBI's assistance has generally concentrated on
several relatively industrialized States. The States of Gujarat, Maharash-
tra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal together account for 49% of total direct
assistance, 46% of refinance, and 66% of rediscounting provided in the past
five and quarter years. However, the proportion of direct assistance given
to projects in the industrially backward districts (including those in the
relatively advanced States) has somewhat increased recently: 50% by amount
of direct assistance approved in FY73 was in respect of such projects, com-
pared with 44% for a period from July 1968 through September 1973.
19.       Size of assistance and projects.  A breakdown by size of direct
loans and investments shows that about 70% by amount of total approvals were
for Rs 10 million or more each, whereas less than 2% were for below Rs 1
million each. Sector-wise, about 83% by amount of total approvals went to
the large-scale sector, and the rest to the medium-scale sector. This is



ANNEX 6
Page 5
a logical consequence of IDBI's primary emphasis on modern and relatively
capital intensive projects. By contrast, its refinancing loans have mainly
financed smaller projects. Loans below Rs 1 million each account for 80%
of total refinance approvals, and no refinance proposal over Rs 10 million
has been approved during the past five and a quarter years. About 61% by
amount and 93% by number of these approvals were in respect of small-scale
units.
20.       Loan maturity.  Of total direct loan approvals, the largest num-
ber (39 out of 89 loans) had maturities between 9 and 12 years. It is note-
worthy that 23 loans representing 52% by amount of total approvals had no
fixed repayment schedules as of September 30, 1973, even though the loan
documents were signed. Most of these loans were supplementary assistance
to prcblem projects (cost overruns, debt service difficulty, etc.) for which
IBI has been considering a rehabilitation program. For about half of these
loans, IDBT has since fixed the repayment schedule. The maturity pattern
of IDBI refinance shows that three-fourths of loans (by number) had repay-
ment periods below 10 years.
21.       Nature of proie-!ts.  Both IDBI's direct assistance and refinance
loans have financed mainly new projects as opposed to expansion or modern-
ization of existing projects. 1-f total direct assistance approvals, 59%
by amount went to new projects, 37% to expansion projects, and the remain-
ing 4% covered working capital requirements. As to refinance, 64% were for
new projects and 36% were for expansion projects.
22.       Type of clients.  Of a total of 100 companies to which IDBI's
direct loaas were approved during the five and a quarter years, 61 received
IDBI assistance for the first time, and 39 were old clients. The former
group represented 54% of total loan amounts, and the latter 46%. An over-
whelming majority of the loan recipients belong either to the private sec-
tor (78% by number) or the joint sector (13%); only 9 clients with loans
totalling Rs 79 million (5% of total amounts) are public sector companies.
IDBI's refinance has all been given to private sector companies. The
modest size of IDBI's public-sector financing does not reflect its reluc-
tance to provide such financing, but rather indicates the small demand
from public-sector enterprises.
Economic Impact of IDBI Operations
23.       Some indicators of performance by the recipients of IDBI's direct
assistance, which are at the operational stage, are given in Attachment 6.
Between FY71 and FY73, the cumulative number of companies increased from 88
to 119, their direct employment from 133,000 to 160,000 and the total capi-
tal employed by these companies from Rs 9.7 billion to Rs 13.6 billion. Thus,
the average investment per job created has increased from Rs 73,000 in FY71
to Rs 85,000 in FY73, indicating that IDBI-assisted projects have become in-
creasingly capital-intensive over the past three years. At the same time,
IDBI has financed an increasing proportion of the total capital requirements



ANNEX 6
Page 6
of assisted projects: IDBI's direct assistance as a percentage of total
project costs has risen from 12% in FY71 to 20% in FY73. Financial per-
formance of IDBI-assisted projects has improved: the net value-added/
capital ratio has increased from 24% in FY71 to 32% in FY73.
Promotional Activities
24.       IDBI's promotional activities have been intensified since 1970
when IDBI started taking the initiative in conducting a series of indus-
trial surveys of less developed States and Union Territories, coordinating
the activities of State-level financial institutions, and strengthening the
mechanisms of technical assistance. IDBI has recently further stepped up
its activities in these areas.
25.       Industrial surveys.  By end-December 1973, 16 surveys covering
all but one of the States and Union Territories classified by the Govern-
ment as industrially backward were completed, and 14 reports were pub-
lished. These surveys were carried out by joint-institutional study teams
comprising officials of IDBI, RBI, IFCI, ICICI, et al. to identify indus-
trial potentials and specific project ideas in these States. In addition,
IDBI has extended assistance to similar surveys of backward areas in the
relatively developed States, such as Kerala, Karnataka and West Bengal, by
having its officials participate in such surveys or by bearing the survey
cost. Altogether, 330 project ideas have so far emerged from these surveys,
of which 28 are already under implementation, 11 are pending with financial
institutions for assistance, and 152 are being pursued by prospective entre-
preneurs.
26.       Inter-Institutional Groups (IIGs) at State level.  Since July 1972,
eight more IIGs have been formed, bringing the total number of such groups to
14. Consisting of representatives of SFCs, SIDCs, lead banks, State Govern-
ments, and the All-India term-lending institutions, IIGs have met periodi-
cally to discuss issues arising from project identification and implementa-
tion. Some of the topics discussed at recent IIG meetings in various States
include: (a) organizing an entrepreneurial training program (Kerala, Andhra
Pradesh, Assam, Bihar); (b) disseminating information on identified projects
to attract prospective entrepreneurs (Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa); and
(c) following up on industrial licenses issued by the Government (Karnataka,
Andhra Pradesh).
27.       Technical assistance.  In view of the difficulty for every State-
level institution to be equipped with adequate technical capabilities, IDBI
has been encouraging the establishment of jointly-sponsored Technical Con-
sultancy Service Centers (TCSCs) which conduct technical appraisals for
financial institutions as well as prepare project feasibility reports for
prospective entrepreneurs. The first TCSC, the Kerala Industrial and Tech-
nical Consultancy Organization (KITCO), was established in February 1972,
and has been very active in providing these services. In May 1973, another



ANNEX 6
Page 7
TCSC was organized at Gauhati, Assam, to offer similar services to the States
and Union Territories in the North Eastern Region. IDBI has contributed to
the share capital of both organizations and is represented on their boards
of directors. Finally, in June 1974, the Bihar Industrial and Technical
Consultancy Organization was established for similar purpose. Additional
TCSCs are planned in other States.
Financial Performance
28.       IDBI's income statements for the three and a half years through
December 1973 are shown in Attachment 7 and summarized below:
As % of Average Total Assets
FY71   FY72   FY73        FY74
(first half)
Gross Income              6.07   6.00   6.15         6.42
Financial Expenses        3.83   3.99   4.04         4.23
Administrative Expenses  0.36   0.39   0.36          0.43
Profit                    1.88   1.62   1.75         1.76
29.       After a low in FY72, IDBI's profitability improved slightly in
FY73. The main reason was a substantial increase in income from share
investments in industrial enterprises, which, including capital gains on
share sales, more than doubled from Rs 6 million in FY72 to Rs 14 million
in FY73. The average yield on shares increased from 3.4% to 7.7% between
these two years. On the other hand, the growth of interest income from
term loans, which accounts for the bulk of total income, has been slow in
recent years. The yield on IDBI's term loan portfolio declined from 6.6%
in FY72 to 6.2% in FY73. This is partly explained by a significant in-
crease in the proportion of refinancing loans made at concessionary rates
of interest: at end-FY73, almost 40% of the refinance portfolio carried
interest at 5% or below, compared with 27% a year before. Since the aver-
age cost of IDBI's term debts rose slightly during FY73, the margin on its
term loans dropped from 1.5% in FY72 to 1.2% in FY73. IDBI's administra-
tive costs have been maintained around 0.4% of average total assets. For
FY73, IDBI paid dividends to RBI at 3.75%, the same rate as in the past.
30.       IDBI's balance sheets for the past three and a half years are
attached as Attachment 8. It's total assets increased by 22% during FY72,
and further by 14% during FY73. Among all items, the balance of redis-
counted b:Llls, which grew by 85% during the two years, made the largest
contribution to the overall growth of portfolio, followed by direct proj-
ect loans and refinance of industrial loans, both of which increased by
22% over the period. On the liabilities side, the bulk of the increase
is accounted for the borrowings from RBI, which more than doubled over
the two years. As of June 30, 1973, IDBI's debt/equity ratio (including
guarantees in debts) stood at 5.0, a slight increase from 4.6 a year ear-
lier, and its reserves amounted to 9.2% of total portfolio.

INDUSTRIAL FINANCE CORPORATION OF INDIA (IFCI)
Origins
1.        The Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI) was established
soon after India gained independence in 1947. IFCI was created by Parlia-
mentary statute in March 1948 and officially began operations on July 1, 1948
with the objective of making "medium and long term credits more readily avail-
able to industrial concerns in India, particularly in circumstances where
normal banking accommodation is inappropriate or recourse to capital issue
methods is impracticable". In subsequent years, IFCI's activities have broad-
ened substantially both in terms of the range of assistance it offers and the
types of projects and the regions it finances.
Scope of Activities
2.        As in the case of all other All-India institutions, IFCI is pre-
pared to grant both foreign and local currency loans, underwrite or make
direct subscription to shares and debentures, and provide local and for-
eign guarantees. Concerns which are eligible for IFCI assistance include
public and private limited companies, and cooperative societies which are
engaged in manufacturing, shipping, mining, tourism, and the generation or
distribution of any form of power. There are no official limitations on
the amounts that IFCI is prepared to loan to individual enterprises, though,
in practice, it would be reluctant to put more than Rs 20-30 million in any
one project. Beyond this it would rely on joint financing arrangements with
other All-India institutions. IFCI does not provide working capital finance
save in exceptional circumstances. IFCI's policies and priorities correspond
to those of GOI and include:
(a) the promotion of new entrepreneurs;
(b) the development of backward areas;
(c) the development of the cooperative sector;
(d) the development of indigenous technology; and
(e) the development of import substitution and
export-oriented projects.
Ownership
3.        IFCI's ownership structure consists of a 50% shareholding by IDBI
with the balance held by scheduled banks (20%), insurance concerns (22%),
and cooperative banks (8%). As of June 30, 1973, the paid-up capital stood
at Rs 100 million, while the authorized capital was Rs 200 million.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
Board
4.        IFCI's Board consists of 13 members, including the Chairman, who
is appointed by the Union Government. Four members are appointed by IDBI
and two by the Union Government while the remaining six are elected by the
scheduled banks, insurance concerns and cooperative banks. Under Article
6(3) of the Industrial Finance Corporation Act, 1948, "the Board shall be
guided by such instructions on questions of policy as may be given to it
by the Development Bank." The Chairman is appointed for a three-year term,
while elected directors hold office for four years. IFCI's Board and Man-
agement is also assisted by five Advisory Committees (chemicals, jute, en-
gineering, textiles and sugar).
Management and Organization
5.        IFCI's management is headed by Mr. Khanna, the Chairman of IFCI
since its inception and is assisted by the General Manager, Mr. B. Pasricha.
One important feature of the organization is the extent to which IFCI has
opened regional and branch offices in order to increase its assistance to
the less developed regions of the country.
Lending Terms
6.        IFCI provides rupee financing at 10-1/2% per annum (with a 1/2%
rebate for prompt payment), a slightly higher rate than other All-India
institutions. Like ICICI it provides foreign exchange financing at 10.50%
per annum. IFCI normally offers grace periods of up to three years with
total maturities ranging from 10-12 years. In the same way as the other
All-Indian institutions, it also provides concessional financing to proj-
ects in backward areas.
Operational Results
7.        A summary of IFCI's operational record is contained in Attach-
ment 1. From its inception up to June 30, 1973, IFCI has sanctioned 990
loans involving Rs 3.5 billion of which Rs 2.96 billion has been disbursed
and Rs 1.85 billion is outstanding. Within this amount, the great majority
is represented by local currency financing totalling 86% by amount of sanc-
tions and 84% by amount of outstandings as of June 30, 1973. These propor-
tions reflect IFCI's limited access to foreign currency. If underwriting,
direct subscription and guarantees are aggregated, IFCI has financed 1,403
projects amounting to Rs 4.4 billion since inception, of which Rs 2.2 bil-
lion was outstanding as of June 30, 1973.
Charactexistics of Operations
8.   (a)  Industrial distribution:  Because of the expertise IFCI has
acquired in certain subsectors, it is not surprising to find that IFCI's
approvals (which stem from allocations made by CGC) are concentrated in
areas such as sugar (22.7% by amount) chemicals (18.2% by amount) and
textiles (12% by amount) (Attachment 2).



ANNEX 7
Page 3
(b) Regional distribution: A breakdown of IFCI's historical approvals
on a regional basis is contained in Attachment 3 and shows that the States
of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have been the most important recipients of
IFCI assistance (22.6% and 13.0% respectively). Similarly, some of the
small and less developed States such as Assam have received only small
amounts of assistance. Nevertheless, it is estimated that 32.7% of total
approvals up to December 31, 1973 has gone to less-developed States, while
29.2% has gone to less-developed districts for the same period.
(c) New versus existing: IFCI has attempted, where possible, to give
priority to new projects. As of June 30, 1973, 65% by amount of IFCI's as-
sistance had gone to new undertakings, with the balance for expansion, mod-
ernization and diversification.
(d) Size of loan: Though IFCI has made a number of loans for amounts
less than Rs 1 million (15 by number), generally speaking the majority of
its loans have been for amounts in excess of Rs 5 million, with 21% by num-
ber and 58% by amount involving loans of more than Rs 10 million.
Resource Position
9.        A breakdown of the sources of finance on a disbursement basis as
of June 30, 1973 for IFCI projects is contained in the following table:
Rs million          %
Paid-up Capital                              100.0           3.10
Reserves                                     183.4           5.69
Bond Issues                                  851.7          26.44
GOI                                          694.7          21.57
RBI                                           26.8           0.83
Foreign Credits                              427.3          13.27
Loan Repayments and Investment Sales         937.2          29.10
3,221.1         100.00
It shows that aside from loan repayments and sales of investments, bond
issues (26.44%) and Government of India loans (21.57%) have been the most
important sources of funds for IFCI. On the other hand, foreign credits
have represented only 13.27% of total assets.
10.       In the case of the bond issues, which are considered trustee
securities under the Indian Trust Act of 1882, IFCI's policy is to make
one issue per year which for the past eight years has carried rates of
5-3/4% (except for the latest issue at 6%). IFCI's foreign resources are
not abundant. Aside from US assistance, which has been fully committed,
IFCI had relied as of June 30, 1973 on KfW (DM 128.5 million), the UK (E 3.5
million) and Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur (FF 15 million), the
latter two sources being tied with respect to procurement. As of June 30,



ANNEX 7
Page 4
1973 IFCI had Rs 46.8 million in foreign exchange equivalent available for
approvals, consisting of, in equivalent terms, Rs 26.9 million from the UK,
Rs 17.2 million from KfW and Rs 2.7 million from France.
Promotion
11.       Along with its establishment of more branch and sub-offices,
and the provision of concessional finance to backward areas, IFCI in
recent years has taken on a much more promotional posture. Along with
the other All-India institutions, it has actively participated in the
surveys of each State that were undertaken in the past few years. At
present, IFCI has specific responsibility for the States of Rajasthan,
Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and the Union Terri-
tories of Chandigarh and Delhi. IFCI also participated in the estab-
lishment of the Kerala Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organization
(KITCO) and the North Eastern Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organi-
zation (NEITCO).
12.       In addition, by another amendment to the IFCI Act, a "Benevolent
Reserve Fund" was established within IFCI to finance the cost of feasibility
studies, to promote projects in backward areas particularly by new entre-
preneurs and to finance research and development banking through the estab-
lishment of institutes and through training of personnel. As of June 30,
1973, Rs 4 million had been transferred to this fund. Even prior to the
creation of the fund, IFCI had financed the establishment of the Management
Development Institute (MDI) which has made a successful beginning in train-
ing staff from financial institutions. Moreover, IFCI has become relatively
active in seconding its own staff to those of State Financial Corporations
(e.g. three staff seconded to the Punjab SFC), the financing of which also
comes under the Benevolent Reserve Fund.
Public Sector Financing
13.       In response to a Government directive in 1970 for all All-India
institutions to consider the financing of public sector projects, IFCI has
to date financed nine projects in the public sector with loans amounting
to Rs 97.7 million. There does not appear to have been much demand for
this financing perhaps partly because until December 1972, IFCI was not
permitted to finance private limited companies even though they were in
the public sector.
Financial Position
14.       IFCI's financial position for the past two years is contained in
Attachmenits 4 through 7, showing income statements, balance sheets, sources
and uses of funds, and operational ratios for FY72 and FY73. Specifically,
IFCI's net profit increased from Rs 21.9 million in FY72 to Rs 29.0 million
in FY73. Profit after tax as a percentage of year-end share capital in-
creased from 22.8% in FY72 to 29.0% in FY73. Administrative expense as a
percentage of average total assets was approximately 0.6% in both years.



ANNEX 7
Page 5
15.       IFCI's debt/equity ratio increased from 6.3:1 to 6.4:1 while the
debt service coverage increased from 1.30:1 to 1.66:1. Total assets which
grew by only 0.8% from FY72 to FY73 increased by 13.7% in FY73. Reserves
plus provisions as a percentage of year-end portfolio increased from 7.9%
to 8.4%. IFCI's loan portfolio is reasonably sound with actual arrears of
principal and interest as a percentage of total loans outstanding amounting
to 6.91% as of June 30, 1973. IFCI's book value as a percentage of par
value reached 283 in FY73 and a record high dividend of 6% was declared.
IFCI's accounts have been audited by the auditing firm of Ray & Ray and
Haribahkti without qualification.

INDUWSTRIAL RECONSTRUCTION CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED (IRCI)
Origins
1.        The Industrial Reconstruction Corporation of India Limited (IRCI)
was established on April 12, 1971 with the objective of reviving industrial
units that had either been closed or were in substantial difficulty. IRCI
was set up in Calcutta primarily because, at least in the initial years,
it was exlpected that most of its activities would be concentrated in West
Bengal.
9Ojct ives
2.        IRCI's objectives are contained in Articles 2 and 3 of its Memo-
randum oi: Association which state that it was established:
"To promote and operate schemes for industrial development
of the country and in particular for the rehabilitation of
industrial concerns which need rehabilitation; and to promote
industrial development of the country by providing, affording
or procuring financial and all other kinds of assistance for
the establishment, maintenance, working equipment, development,
expansion, reorganization, diversification, rationalization,
modernization or rehabilitation of industrial concerns and
for the provision of infrastructure facilities for the use of
industrial concerns and generally for industrial development
of the country and to operate schemes for the same."
=wnership
3.        IRCI has an authorized capital of Rs 250 million of which Rs 100
million had been subscribed and Rs 50 million paid-in as of March 31, 1974.
The major shareholder is the Industrial Development Bank of India which
nolds 50% of the shares and indirectly an additional 5% by virtue of the
ownership of the Industrial Finance Corporation of India. Other prominent
shareholders include LIC (4%), ICICI (2.5%), State Bank of India (3.5%) and
the 14 nat:ionalized banks (each with 2.5%).
Organization
4.        IRCI's organizational structure is made up of an Appraisal Cell
(stuidy and investigation, economic planning, and legal departments), Fol-
low-up and. Specialist Services. IRCI recently established a representative
office in New Delhi to liaise with government officials.



ANNEX 9

Board of Directors
5.        IRCI has a 12-man Board of Directors as shown in Attachment 1
which consists of some of the most prominent banking officials in India,
including the Chairman of ICICI and the General Manager of IDBI. Under
Article III of the Articles of Association, the Board can have a minimum
of 9 and a maximum of 15 members. IDBI is responsible for appointing the
Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and the Managing Director. The President
of India appoints one Director, while the remainder are elected at the
Annual Shareholders' meeting. One third of the Board is expected to
rotate each year. An Executive Committee has been established which
can approve loans up to Rs 5 million. The Board handles all loans in
excess of this amount. However, under Article 189 of the Articles of
Association:
"The Chairman shall reserve for the approval of the Industrial
Development Bank of India any proposals to or decisions of
the Board of Directors in respect of any matter which, in the
opinion of the Chairman, are of such importance as shouXd be
reserved for such approval."
Management
6.        The Managing Director is appointed by IDBI for a maximum of five
years. Mr. C. T. Das, the first and only Managing Director, had a three-
year contract which expired in April 1974. There is also a General Manager,
Mr. Tiwari, who was seconded by IDBI.
Staff
7.        IRCI presently has 56 professional staff, and is expecting to
recruit 10-12 more in the coming year. Of these, approximately 60% are
financial analysts and 40% are engineers. Initially, it was somewhat
difficult to attract competent staff to IRCI both as regular employees,
and employees to be seconded to its client units, partly because IRCI
had an unproven record and because of its location in Calcutta. As a
result, many of those recruited had reached the retirement age with
other financial institutions, though this trend has been reversed in
the last couple of years as IRCIts performance had become better inown.
Policies and Procedures
8.        IRCI does not have a specific Policy Statement apart from the
Memorandum and Articles of Association but does have priorities in terms
of the types of industries it will assist. Specifically, it prefers to
work with existing rather than closed units, those that involve high em-
ployment potential, and those that stand high in national priorities.
IRCI is prepared to provide loan financing (in some cases with converti-
bility clauses which are not normally exercised)q guarantees primarily



ANNEX 9
Page 3
for working capital financing from commercial banks, and direct managerial
assistance. IRCI first attempts to utilize existing capacity before pro-
viding additional fixed asset financing. IRCI charges 8-1/2% on its loans,
but will charge 7-1/2% for small-scale units, and 7% for units in backward
areas.  [RCI is prepared to consider in exceptional cases a moratorium on
interest to improve the liquidity position of an enterprise in the latter's
earlier years. This appears to have occurred fairly frequently since in-
terest income as a percentage of average portfolio was 5.4% in FY73.
Appraisal Procedures
9.        Applications come to IRCI from a variety of sources including
the entrepreneur, the banking institution presently financing him, and,
in cases where the State Government has taken over the institution, the
State Government itself. In the early years, there was an avalanche of
applications, many of which were in search of cheap money rather than
requiring restructuring assistance. Hence, it is not surprising to find
that out of 325 applications studied in detail up to June 30, 1973, only
67 were accepted (21%) while the remainder were rejected as undeserving.
IRCI prepares an elaborate appraisal report which normally takes appro-
ximately two months, though in small-scale units it might be two weeks.
Hlowever, for complex projects a one-year period is possible.
10.       Though complete information is not available, it appears that
much of [RCI's financing has gone to repay the current debts of entrepre-
neurs to other financial institutions, though some fixed asset financing
(32% of the total) has also taken place.
Resource Mobilization
11.       IRCI has relied mainly upon its share capital which now totals
Rs 100 million and its unsecured interest-free loan from Government of
Lhe same amount for its major resource requirements. Moreover, where
other All-India institutions have previously financed one of IRCI's
clients, joint financed proposals are not uncommon during the recon-
structioia phase. To date, IRCI has had no access to foreign exchange.
Operational Results
12.       As of January 31, 1974, IRCI had assisted 73 industrial units
with loans amounting to Rs 198.5 mvilion. Details of these operations
are contained in the table below:

It is worth noting that of the 73 units assisted, 66 are iocated in West
Bengal, with the remaining seven located in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh,
Bihar, Delhi, Kerala and two in Maharashtra; 45% by number of the units
financed were for the small-scale sector while 19% were in backward areas.
Causes of Difficulty
13.       IRCI has conducted a study of 200 applications that it has received
for assistance to determine the origins of the problem. The most common rea-
sons (in most cases there is more than one reason) were a shortage of working
capital (41%), labor problems (27%), lack of financial discipline (21%), and
lack of raw materials (17%). It is estimated that of 53 units which have
resumed production, 28 are operating in the "black", 15 are breaking even,
while about 10 are still in significant difficulty.  IRCI is extremely active
in the area of follow-up (beyond normal follow-up procedures) to include con-
tacts with suppliers of raw materials, marketing assistance, secondment of
IRCI staff as chief executives and detailed reporting requirements.
Other Activities
14.       IRCI has taken the lead in the establishment of a central textile
processing house to provide facilities for bleaching, dyeing and printing,
etc., involving an investment of Rs 45 million, of which IRCI is contributing
Rs 6 million in the form of equity. It is expected that the unit could pro-
duce 150,000 meters of cloth per day.
Financial Position
15.       Profitability:  IRCI's profit and loss statement for the past
two years in provided in Attachment 2. Profit before tax increased from
Rs 1.6 million in FY72 to Rs 4.8 million in FY73. At the same time, profit
before tax as a percentage of year-end share capital increased from 1.5% to
2.9%. Administrative expenses in FY73 as a percentage of average total assets
were 1.5. In the early years of its operations, IRCI's earnings were sub-
stantially more from investments and deposits than from reconstruction as-
sistance, though this will change as business expands. However, given the
developmental orientation of the Corporation, it is odd that it is obliged
to pay taxes which have amounted to over 50% of gross profit for the past



ANNEX 9
Page 5
two years. IRCI is apparently petitioning GOI to waive the tax obligations
of the Corporation.
Capital Structure
16.       IRCI's balance sheet for the past two years is contained in
Attachment 3. Total assets have grown by over 50% in the last fiscal
year. IRCI's debt/equity ratio increased from 0.99:1 in FY72 to 1.88:1
in FY73 despite the fact that under Article 71 of the Articles of Asso-
ciation, IRCI's borrowing cannot exceed its own share capital and reserves.
IRCI's reserves as a percentage of average portfolio were 3.7 in FY73. No
dividends are reported in the near future. As for IRCI's future resource
requirements, its forecasts indicate a continued reliance on government
funds (Rs 125 million) and a bond issue (Rs 25 million).
Conclusions
17.       IRCI has made a successful start in the difficult task of revi-
talising sick industrial units particularly in the State of West Bengal.
After some early "teetching" problems, IRCI appears to have developed
into a reasonably effective institution with competent staff and an in-
creasing All-India orientation.

NATIONAL SMALL INDUSTRIES CORPORATION (NSIC)
Origins
1.        The National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) was established
in 1955 to assist in the financing and promotion of small-scale industry.
In its early years, it functioned largely as a promotional organization
but by 1960 it had become more active in the areas of hire purchase and
industrial estates.
Objectives
2.        NSIC's objectives are to assist the small-scale industry through
an "integrated approach". This includes:
(a) hire purchase facilities for machinery;
(b) managerial training;
(c) provision of technical know-how through prototype
development and training centers (PDTCs);
(d) arrangement for the supply of raw materials;
(e) domestic and export marketing assistance;
(f) the arrangement of Government purchase of small-
scale sector output.
Organization
3.        NSIC is a centrally controlled organization with its head office
in New Delhi and regional offices in Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta, though
all investment decisions are taken in Delhi.
Ownership
4.        NSIC is wholly Government-owned with a paid-in share capital of
Rs 35 million. NSIC has a 10-man Board of Directors chaired by Mr. K. Sapru.
NSIC's staff amounts to almost 1,500 of which about 340 are managerial and
supervisory staff. The quality of the staff is not considered to be high.
Policies and Procedures
5.        The most important part of NSIC's activity is its hire purchase
operations which are limited to industries in the small-scale sector and
for machinery which costs more than Rs 1,000. As of April 1, 1974, NSIC
charged 9% per annum on the sale price while offering a 2% rebate for



ANNEX 10
Page 2
pror.ipt pa,ment. In the case of overdues a penalty fee of 12% was charged.
Applicants paid an application fee ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 250, an admin-
istrative charge of 2% which was added to the installment obligations, and
'earnest'' money payments which were down payments and which amounted to 5%
for limported machines and 10% for indigenous machines. The repayment period
varied from about 6 to 8 years with approximately 1-1/2 years of grace, dur-
ing wihichi time NSIC retains title to the equipment. NSIC has been criti-
cized by entrepreneurs for the lengthy period of time it takes to process
a loan application which is some cases has amounted to several years, per-
haps parliy on account of its centralized approvals. When applications are
received, enquiries are "floated" to suppliers mentioned in the applications
from which firm quotations are sought. According to NSIC management, appraisal
work is thin.
Rscurces
.         NiS'IC has relied largely on Government resources to finance its
operatonjs w-hich amounted at the end of FY73 to Rs 143.2 million outstand-
ing .(in_:-.uding foreign credits 1/ to the GOI which are on-lent to NSIC in
P-upees).  -n addition, NSIC has approximately Rs 50 million in share capi-
.3l and reserves and Rs 30 million in bank credit. However, at the same
time it carried losses on its balance sheet amounting to Rs 21.6 million
(para 1M1. In the case of foreign resources, NSIC had received financial
assistance from USAID though all this has been repaid, and the only out-
Land1it; foreign assistance comes from KfW and amounts to Rs 92.3 million.
preserLt NSIC management considers itself to be short of financial re-
sources.
Operational Results
7         Hire purchase.  Since inception up to the end of FY73, NSIC
has supplied machinery to the small-scale sector valued at approximately
Rs 680 million wVhich represented 26,000 machines allocated to 13,000
small-scale units. In FY72, NSIC did record business in hire purchase
amounting, to Rs 107 million, though this declined in FY73 to Rs 74.7
million, on accounit of, according to NSIC, a shortage of resources.
Approximately 65% of machinery is imported, while about 45% of machin-
ery financed has been for the engineering industry.  The Southern,
Northern and Western Regions have each received about 29% of hire pur-
chase assistance with the balance (13%) going to the Eastern Region.

8.        Government purchases.  The value of contracts secured under the
Government Purchase Scheme has grown from Rs 6.2 million in FY58 to Rs 550
million in FY72. At the end of FY73 1/ the total amount of contracts was
Rs 3.1 billion representing 33,316 contracts.
9.        Marketing.  With the establishment of the Export Department of
the Corporation recently, NSIC has succeeded in securing orders amounting
to Rs 5 million for the products of small-scale industries.
10.       Prototype Development and Training Centers (PDTCs).  NSIC has
established three PDTCs at Okhla (New Delhi), Rajkot and Howrah with four
more proposed in the near future. To date, 54 prototypes have been devel-
oped in these centers. In addition, over 7,000 trainees have attended
courses at the centers.
Financial Position
11.       NSIC's financial position can only be described as weak.  A
breakdown of NSIC's profitability for FY73 is contained in the following
table. Net profit for the year was Rs 6.58 million but only because of
the subsidy of Rs 18.2 million by which the Government offset the histor-
ical effects of the rupee devaluation in 1966 and subsequent DM revalua-
tions for which NSIC bore the risk. Since FY67, NSIC has operated at a
loss in every year; the accumulated loss amounted to Rs 24.4 million.
Thus, NSIC presently carries a net cumulative loss of Rs 17.8 million
on the assets side of its balance sheet, an amount greater than its
total reserves and surplus.
1/   192 items are secured under the Scheme for procurement in the small-
scale sector.

Proposed Reforms
12.       NSIC has been the subject of two studies, one by a Review Com-
mittee and the other by a One-Man Enquiry Committee headed by Mr. R. P.
Sinha.  In general, the suggestion is that NSIC become the refinance
agency for the SSICs in the case of domestic machinery while limiting
itself to direct financing of imported machinery. There is still con-
siderable discussion both in the Government and in NSIC as to the best
approach to take, and until decisions are taken, it is not possible to
assess NSIC's future potential. Nevertheless, on the basis of past per-
formance, NSIC does not appear to have been an effective institution.

ANNEX 14
Page 1
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE IDBI ACT
1.        The IDBI Act was last amended in December 1972, when IDBI was
empowered to give assistance to a wider range of industries with a longer
period for repayment. A proposal for further amendments to the Act is
currently under discussion in the Parliament. If enacted, the proposed
amendments could bring about a fundamental change in IDBI's character,
structure and its role vis-a-vis other financial institutions in general
and SFCs in particular. Another recent development which may have a pro-
found effect on the functions of the five All-India term-lending institu-
tions is the proposal, under discussion by Government officials, to estab-
lish a "common appraisal unit" as a separate institution, which would assume
the responsibility for appraising and following up on projects jointly fi-
nanced by these institutions.
Proposed Amendments to IDBI Act
2.        The draft Bill proposing a series of new amendments to the IDBI
Act as well as to the statutes of RBI, IFCI, the SFCs, LIC and UTI was
introduced into the Parliament in December 1973, and after brief debate
in February 1974, was referred to a Select Committe.  The Committee is
expected to report its conclusions by late 1974 and the Parliament is
likely to reach a final decision about the same time. The more impor-
tant amendments to the IDBI Act, and to the SFC Act insofar as they would
affect ID:BI's relationship with SFCs, are summarized in the following para-
graphs.
3.        Ownership.  IDBI's authorized capital would be increased from
the current Rs 500 million to Rs 1 billion, with GOI having the power to
increase it further to Rs 2 billion. The issued capital, currently held
entirely by RBI, would be transferred to GOI, and any further share issues
would be wholly subscribed by GOI.
4.        Board of Directors.  Instead of sharing a Board with RBI 1/,
IDBI would have an independent Board of Directors with a maximum member-
ship of 21, consisting of a Chairman, a Managing Director, an RBI Deputy
Governor, two Government officials, up to five representatives of other
All-India term-lending institutions, up to six representatives of the
commercial banks and SFCs, and at least five persons who have special
knowledge or experience which, in GOI's opinion, would be useful to IDBI.
Except for the Deputy Governor of RBI, all Directors are to be appointed
by GOI. Both the Chairman and the Managing Director would have a term
1/  The statutory limit on the existing Board membership is 20; the actual
number of Directors is currently 18.



ANNEX 14
Page 2
of office not exceeding five years, but would be eligible for reappoint-
ment. Their salaries would be determined by GOI. IDBI would have an
Executive Committee consisting of 11 members including the Chairman,
the Managing Director and the Director nominated by RBI.
5.        Government Directives.  GOI would have a new power to give
directions to IDBI in matters of policy involving the public interest,
and IDBI would be guided by such directions.
6.        Staff.  Those staff members currently assigned to IDBI would
have 18 months in which to decide whether to return to RBI or to remain
in IDBI; the actual transfer of staff would take place within 30 Months.
Likewise, if any of RBI's functions is transferred to IDBI as a result
of the reorganization, the RBI staff who were performing such functions
would be given a similar option. While IDBI would have autonomy regard-
ing the appointment of its staff, the staff salaries would be determined
by regulations which the IDBI Board could make with the previous approval
of the Government.
7.        Audit.  IDBI's accounts would continue to be audited by auditors
duly qualified under the Companies Act, but the auditors would be appointed
by GOI and not by RBI as before.  IDBI's accounts and the auditor's report
have been published in the Official Gazette, but after the amendment, they
would first be placed before the Parliament.
8.        Amendments to SFC Act.  The proposed amendments to the SFC Act
would substantially increase IDBI's powers to control and supervise SFCs'
operations, mainly by transferring to IDBI the powers hitherto held by
RBI. The more important amendments in this regard are as follows:
(a)  Ownership.  RBI's holdings of share in SFCs wou14 be
wholly transferred to IDBI;
(b)  Board representation.  IDBI's representation on an SFC's
Board would increase from the present one to two. Also,
the State Government would consult with and obtain the
advice of IDBI, instead of RBI, in appointing the Man-
aging Director;
(c) Inspection. The responsibility for inspecting SFCs
would be transferred from RBI to IDBI. This would
necessitate transferring the functions currently per-
formed by RBI's Industrial Finance Department to IDBI;
(d) Resource Control. IDBI would take over from RBI (or
join with it in performing) the supervisory functions
with respect to SFCs' resource mobilization. SFCs
would thus be required to consult with or seek the
approval of IDBI regarding their bond issues, borrowing



ANNEX 14
Page 3
from RBI and the State Government, accepting deposits,
and raising a special class of shares with no dividend
requirements; and
(e) Policy Control. The State Government would consult with
and obtain the advice of IDBI, instead of RBI, in issuing
instructions on questions of policy. IDBI would also
replace RBI in giving approvals to SFCs which wish to
retain their share investments beyond seven years.
9.        As can be seen from the above synopsis, the proposed amendments
reflect the Government's policy intentions in two matters. One is to sever
the organizational relationship between IDBI and RBI, and bring IDBI under
direct control of GOI. The other is further to strengthen IDBI's role as
an apex Lnstitution in the field of industrial financing, and centralize
in IDBI the coordinating and supervising functions, hitherto shared by
IDBI and RBI, vis-a-vis other national and State-level financial institu-
tions catering to the industrial sector.
10.       One favorable consequence, in the context of the IDA Credit to
the SFCs, would be the proposed transfer to IDBI of the responsibility to
inspect zmd otherwise supervise SFCs, which currently rests with RBI. This
transfer would facilitate IDBI's efforts to upgrade SFCs' performance. Also,
it appears that most of the IDBI staff would opt to stay with IDBI, though
the RBI staff association (which includes IDBI staff) objects to the pro-
posal on the grounds that it reduces the career prospects of RBI staff.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to predict how effectively the new set-up
would work if the Bill were passed in its present form, for so much depends
upon how it is implemented. Whether or not IDBI could continue to recruit
qualified staff would depend partly on its pay-scale which are proposed to
be regulaLted, though indirectly, by GOI.

ICICI'S OVERALL OPERATIONS
Trends
1.        General.  Despite the stagnating economic conditions, the capital
goods industries have been performing well, and the general investment
climate has been relatively good. 1/ ICICI's operations have continued
to rise in nominal terms. Total net approvals increased by 6% in 1974
to Rs 627.2 million compared with Rs 592.7 million in 1973, Rs 523.5 mil-
lion in 1972 (a year of good industrial performance) and Rs 405.0 million
in 1971. Approvals in 1974 did not grow as fast as in 1973 partially be-
cause of the economic slackness, but also because of a cyclical levelling-
off after a period of extensive activity. Commitments sharply increased
during 1973 to Rs 628.7 million from Rs 362.3 million in 1972 and Rs 357.9
million in 1971; the sharp increase in commitments during 1973 is mainly
explained by commitments of a large backlog of foreign currency loans
approved. During 1974 commitments declined to Rs 505.4 million mainly
because of foreign resource constraints, which caused ICICI to slow down
foreign currency commitments pending sanction of the proposed IBRD Loan.
Disbursements went up in 1974 to Rs 483.6 million (or an increase of 16%)
compared with Rs 416.1 in 1973, Rs 374.9 million in 1972, and Rs 305.7
million in 1971. A summary of ICICI's recent operations is shown in
Attachment 1.
2.        Loans.  Foreign currency loans account for 59%, and local cur-
rency loans for 23% of total ICICI approvals since its inception. From
1971 to 1974, rupee loans accounted for 29% of total ICICI approvals. The
reasons for the increasing importance over the last 4 years of ICICI's
rupee loans are given in para 13.
3.        From 1971 to 1974, foreign currency loans accounted for 60% of
total approvals. Approvals of foreign currency loans grew from Rs 224.8
million in 1970 (a record year) to Rs 419.1 million in 1974, or by a com-
pounded annual growth rate of 17%. 2/ Disbursements grew by about 10% per
annum during that period. Commitments have also attained a satisfactory
growth; they more than doubled in 1973 (rising from Rs 214.6 million in
1972 to Rs 435.0 million), thus clearing up a substantial portion of the
backlog. The reduction in 1974 was mainly for reasons not related to the
economic environment or ICICI (para 1).
1/   As evidenced by data on issuance of industrial license and capital
goods clearances (para 2.14 of the text).
2/   Foreign currency loan approvals decreased by 10% in 1971, and grew
by 63% in 1972, 3% in 1973, and 24% in 1974. The irregular growth
is due to bunching of capital goods clearances.



ANNEX 18
Page 2
4.        Investments.  ICICI's investment operations include both direct
subscription and underwriting of debentures and share issues. The two com-
bined constitute 17% of ICICI's total approvals (41% of rupee operations)
since its inception and 11% of total approvals (28% of rupee operations)
from 1971 to June 30, 1974. The decreasing trend in the proportion of this
type of financing by ICICI, contrasted with the growth of rupee loans, re-
flects ICICI's resource constraints, and also the emergence of brokers in
the last few years. Most equity investments are executed in conjunction
with a loan, and for large projects they are arranged jointly with other
financial institutions.
5.        Including underwriting and direct subscription, investment oper-
ations by ICICI reached Rs 34.2 million in 1974 compared to Rs 78.2 million
in 1973, Rs 77.1 million in 1972, and Rs 54.2 million in 1971. Apart from
resource constraints, the reduction in 1974 was also due to the recent
Dividend Ordinance (para 2.16, text). Attachment 2 summarizes the changes
in the volumes and types (shares and debentures) of ICICI's investments.
In view of the weak state of the secondary markets, investment in deben-
tures is now mainly done through direct subscriptions rather than under-
writing (ICICI started directly subscribing to debentures in 1970).  Most
of ICICI's underwriting is in equities. Its policy is to undertake under-
writings of up to about 20% of a company's equity, and to underwrite only
an amount it could absorb in total should the issue fail. ICICI is one
of the pioneers in underwriting in India.
6.        To date, a very small part of ICICI's equity portfolio has been
obtained through conversion rights on its rupee loans and debentures. This
is the result of a OI policy introduced in 1970 to help prevent a concen-
tration of economic power in private hands and to give financial institu-
tions representation on the boards of relatively large enterprises in the
public interest. Conversion rights are sought where the total of ICICI's
rupee assistance exceeds Rs 5 million. Through June 30, 1974, the number
of ICICI projects where the conversion clause had been stipulated was 98,
involving ICICI approvals of Rs 414 million, and amounts convertible of
Rs 81.8 million (excluding 3 cases where ICICI exercised its rights; these
cases involved ICICI approvals of Rs 12 million and the amount converted
was Rs 2.2 million).
7.        Guarantees.  Of total guarantees approved since ICICI's inception
(Rs 74.5 million), some Rs 62.8 million or 84% are to foreign suppliers.
ICICI's guarantees continue to comprise an insignificant part of its oper-
ations (about 1.5% of total approvals since inception). Appraisal and fol-
low up standards are the same for projects financed by ICICI through guaran-
tees (though most projects to which ICICI issues guarantees, usually also
receive ICICI loans as well). Only two projects to which ICICI has issued
guarantees have had defaults. ICICI had to make advances of Rs 2 million
to the foreign suppliers. These advances are then treated as demand rupee
loans to ICICI clients.



ANNEX 18
Page 3
8.        Merchant Banking.  A merchant banking unit with a staff of three
was set up in 1973 (para 3.06). It offers a range of services including
management of underwritings (negotiations with brokers, etc.), assistance
in raising term loans and share capital, accounting, market research and
other financial services. Up to June 30, 1974 it had successfully managed
one equity issue and four more proposals were on hand, for projects in dif-
ferent sectors of industry (aluminum, tinplate, polypropylene fibres,
power boilers, and tissues). The total funds to be raised (including
share capital and term loans) for these projects amount to Rs 330.5 mil-
lion; ICICI's fees total Rs 1.15 million, besides recovery of out of pocket
expenses. In view of ICICI's long experience and contacts in the financial
field, it should be able to make an important contribution through these
activities.
Characteristics
9.        Sectoral Distribution.  Although there is no fixed policy for
distribution of assistance amongst industries, ICICI has tended to con-
centrate more on the modern and non-traditional sectors. Thus, 21% of
all approvals since ICICI's inception have been for chemical and petro-
chemicals, 18% for metals and metal products, and 16% for machinery
manufacture (including electricals). The balance of ICICI's financial
assistance has gone to textiles (9%), automobiles and cycles (6%), pulp
and paper products (6%), rubber (5%), ceramics and glass (4%), shipping
(4%) and other industries (11%). The trends have remained relatively
constant in the last few years (Attachment 3). Though ICICI assists a
wide range of industries, its financing of traditional industries, such
as textiles, is mostly for meeting balancing equipment needs. Large-
scale inclustrial financing in India is mostly undertaken in a joint ven-
ture basis, where the institution with a particular expertise becomes the
"lead bank" (para 4.05, text). In view of ICICI's expertise in the tech-
nologically advanced projects, and of the fact that other institutions
cater more to the traditional sectors, the sectoral distribution of
ICICI's f'inancing is adequate.
10.       Geographical Distribution.  The geographical distribution of
ICICI's approvals of financial assistance from 1955 to June 30, 1974 is
as follows (see Attachment 3): Western India (50%), South India (19%),
North East India (15%), North India (11%), and East India (5%). Compared
to the national averages, 1/ a definite skew in favor of Western India is
apparent. This subject has been under discussion between ICICI and IBRD
1/   The geographical distribution of industrial value added in India for
1969 was: Western India (41%), South India (18%), North East India
(22%), North India (13%), and East India (6%); however, the figures
are not strictly comparable since the overall data for India include
both. private and public sector investment.



ANNEX 18
Page 4
for some time and a small decline in the proportion of financing in Western
India (48%), in favor mainly of South India can be observed in the period
January 1, 1972 to June 30, 1974. Despite the marginal improvement in the
overall geographical diversification (which is in part due to the fact that
a large proportion of non-traditional industries are located in Western
India), there has been marked improvement in terms of financing in backward
areas of the country. Some 46% of ICICI's total financial assistance during
the first half of 1974 was in areas officially defined as "backward" com-
pared to 32% in 1973 and 9% in 1970 (para 5.09, text). The strengthening
of the regional offices (para 3.07, text) should be a useful device to help
ICICI attain a better overall geographical distribution of its financial
assistance.
11.       Diversification of Clientele.  As of June 30, 1974 approvals of
financial assistance by ICICI aggregated Rs 4.7 billion for 1,506 projects
and 888 clients.  Of these 1506 projects, 618 (or 41%) were sponsored by
clients which had received financial assistance from ICICI previously. In
terms of amounts financed, these projects accounted for 45% of ICICI's total
approvals, a reasonable ratio for a development finance company which had
been in operation for almost 20 years with well established clients having
sizeable cash flows. Financial assistance to ICICI director-interested
companies has amounted to about 20% of the total, which is not surprising
given the high quality and diversified nature of ICICI's board. Some 103
projects, accounting for 6% of total ICICI financing, were established by
new entrepreneurs. 1/
12.       Although originally established to finance only private sector
industries, ICICI recently started also financing joint sector companies
(companies with Government ownership between 25%-49% though there is
still some uncertainty over the exact definition). Up to June 30, 1974
it had extended assistance of Rs 240.9 million to 27 such companies,
which represented 5% of its total approvals as of the same date. Though
a nominal amount of ICICI's financing has gone to small scale industries,
large and medium-scale industries have been the major beneficiaries of
ICICI's assistance (para 5.11, text).  As of June 30, 1974, 43% of ICICI's
total outstanding portfolio was in the form of assistance to the 73 Large
Houses in India, compared to about 50% in 1966. The share of ICICI's
lending to these 73 is, and has always been, lower than the investment
share of these houses in the private corporate sector served by ICICI,
and no indication of undue favoritism is apparent. The above evidence
suggests that previous criticisms of ICICI regarding concentration of
its portfolio and diversification of clientele have been largely unjusti-
fied.

ANNEX 18

13.       Local Currency and Import Financing. ICICI is the main source
of foreign currency finance for large projects. 1/ In the last year it
provided 90% of the foreign currency loans extended by term lending insti-
tutions; IFCI provided the rest. Since inception up to June 30, 1974, 592
of ICICI's approvals of financial assistance has been for foreign exchange.
However, import financing has accounted for 56% of total approvals, from
January 1, 1971 to June 30, 1974 and for 53% during the first half of 1974
(Attachment 3). The recent increase in the importance of rupee financing
is partially due to the availability of more rupee resources after the flo-
tation of ICICI's first debenture issue in 1967, to the rupee devaluation
of 1966 which made locally fabricated equipment more attractive, and to the
improving quality of the Indian capital goods industry. It also reflects
the financing of a few large projects, and more recently, the squeeze in
commercial bank credit which increased the demand for ICICI's rupee funds,
since most of its projects include both foreign and rupee currencies. De-
mand for ICICI's rupee loans has been even larger (para 4.03, text). Local
resource constraints have been a factor in a proportional reduction of other
local currency activities (underwriting in direct subscriptions of deben-
tures and equities) vis-a-vis local currency loans and total financing
(para 4). It is important that ICICI be able to continue contributing seed
capital through its equity investment, and it is probable that demand for
ICICI's local currency funds will continue to grow as the Indian capital
goods industry further improves. Thus, the Bank should persist in watching
closely ICICI's progress in raising local currency funds (para 4.03, text).
14.       Nature of Project.  Since inception to June 30, 1974, ICICI had
approved assistance to 1,506 projects, of which 431 (accounting for 37% of
ICICI's assistance by amount) were new projects, and 1,075 (accounting for
63% of ICICI's assistance by amount) were projects for expansion of capa-
city, balancing or modernization. Attachment 3 indicates a relative in-
crease in the financing of new projects during 1973 and the first half of
1974. 2/ The increasing trend towards financing new projects is explained
by ICICI's efforts in promoting projects in backward areas (para 10). ICICI
has presented data on capacity utilization during 1970-71 for 76 new proj-
ects and 33 expansion projects. Out of these 109 projects, 36, or about
one third, were working near capacity (80% or more) during that year. The
number of projects working at a capacity utilization range of 60% - 80% was
33, while there were 21 projects where the capacity utilization level was
below 40%. Taking into account the fact that many of these projects had
been completed. only a year or two earlier, the level of capacity utiliza-
tion could be considered fairly satisfactory, and partly reflects ICICI's
1/   Small and medium sized projects benefit from the IDA credit to IDBI
through the State Financial Corporations.
2/   During 1973, of the 166 projects approved, 56 were new projects and
40 were expansion projects.  Financing of the rem.iini;g 70 pro4ects
was for balancing, modernization, or supplementary financing to meet
cost overruns.



ANNEX 18

appraisal capabilities. It should be also borne in mind tnat capacity
utilization figures do not entirely reflect either the market conditions
or the efficiency of the firm. A number of external factors, such as
availability of essential raw materials, power shortages and interrup-
tions, transport bottlenecks, and disturbed industrial relations were
also responsible for variations in performance.
15.       Size of Loans.  In view of the fact that ICICI caters mainly
to big clients, the average size of its loans is relatively large. During
1973 and the first half of 1974 the average size of loans has remained at
$432,000 per project in the case of foreign currency loans, and reached
Rs 3.5 million per project in the case of rupee loans. Details on the
size of ICICTI's loans are given in Attachment 4. The increasing trend in
the size of ICICI's rupee loans is explained by its increased role in do-
mestic currency financing (para 13).
16.       Maturity of Loans.  Foreign currency loans committed during 1973
and the first half of 1974 had similar maturity structures as in previous
years: 79% had terms of ten years or more; 20% between 5 and 10 years and
1% less than 5 years (Attachment 4). On the other hand, local currency
loans committed during that period has somewhat shorter maturity structures
than previous commitments. Up to 1972, 44% of local currency loans committed
had maturities of 10 years or more, while 55% and 1% had terms of between
5 and 10 years and of less than 5 years, respectively. During 1973 and the
first half of 1974, however, 43% of local currency loans committed had terms
of more than 10 years; 38% between 5 and 10 years and 19% less than 5 years.
The relative increase in medium term loans is explained by the squeeze in
commercial bank credit. While it is anticipated that ICICI might, in the
future, continue increasing its overall domestic currency financing (para
13), it is also expected that once the credit squeeze subsides, the trend
will reverse toward more long-term rather than medium-term funds.
17.       Project Execution.  Up to June 30, 1974, some 1,045 projects, of
the 1,506 projects financed had been completed and started operations, while
the balance were at different stages of construction and/or planning. At-
tachment 5 gives data on the projects completed from 1971 through 1973.
Over 70% of the projects completed during that period were ready on schedule,
or with less than one year delay. Unpunctual completions are mainly due to
import license delays, changes in project design and late delivery of
machinery; performance in this regard has remained steady. However, an
increasing trend in cost overruns can be observed. While 54% of the projects
had been completed within the estimated costs in 1971, more than half of
them had cost overruns during 1972 and 1973 (actual costs were about 12%
over the estimated ones during 1972 and 1973 compared to 5% in 1971). Data
on projects completed during the first half of 1974, also show an increasing
trend in cost overruns (actual costs were about 19% higher than the estimated
ones). The growth in cost overruns is mainly explained by inflation, both
at home and abroad. ICICI is carefully monitoring developments in this

area and reviewing even more carefully the project cost at the time of ap-
praisal. During 1973 and the first half of 1974, some Rs 37.7 million
(4% of total approvals), was for supplementary financing to meet over-
runs. Usually, ICICI expects the promoters to bring in their own funds
to cover cost overruns (as stipulated in the loan agreements) but ICICI
is willing to be flexible when this financing is out of the promoter's
capacity. ICICI's policy of financing overruns only on the merits of
each case is adequate.
18.       Clients Financial Performance.  Attachment 6 gives comparative
financiaL data for a sample of 201 ICICI clients in operation during the
periods April to December 1971, 1972 and 1973. Against the background
of adverse economic factors, the broad financial indicators show that
performance during the latter year has been fair.  On the average, these
companies earned a return on total capital employed of 15.2% during 1973,
compared to 15.9% and 15.0% during 1972 and 1971, respectively. The slightly
lower overall profitability is explained by reduced profit margins; sales
(net of excise) grew by 9% during 1973 compared to 15% during 1972 while
costs escalated more rapidly than sales during 1973 (13%). However, the
general decline in profitability for the total sample was not shared by all
industry groups. Industry groups such as automobiles and cycles, machinery
manufacture, ferrous metal products, rubber, shipping and textiles improved
their profitability 1/ during 1973, while chemicals and petrochemicals and
food products maintained it. Though slightly lower than in 1972, the pro-
fitability of electrical equipment manufacturing industries, continued to
be the highest (24.7% return). The above mentioned subsectors account for
about 702 of ICICI's portfolio. The only industry group which incurred
operating losses in 1973 was the non-ferrous metal group, which accounts
for about 6% of ICICI's portfolio. Thus, the overall performance of ICICI's
portfolio in terms of profitability remains satisfactory.

ANNEX 22

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS BY ICICI
Background
1.        As part of the agreement for the tenth loan to ICICI, ICICI
undertook to conduct economic rate of return analyses for all new and
expansion projects where its proposed assistance was more than Rs 5 mil-
lion and total capital cost was more than Rs 25 million. In addition it
was agreed that effective rates of protection (ERP) and domestic resource
cost (DRC) computations would also be undertaken. For projects where
ICICI proposed assistance would be less than the above amounts, only the
ERP and DRC calculations would be required. Finally, where ICICI assist-
ance was less than Rs 1 million or involved balancing and modernization
projects or service industry projects, economic calculations would not be
required.
Coverage
2.        ICICI financed 185 projects amounting to Rs 681 million from
August 1973 to June 1974 as in the table below:
ICICI's Total
Number         Assistance
(Rs million)
All Projects                                     185               681
Projects Eligible for Economic Rate of
Return Calculation                           39               295.4
of which
New Projects                          30             229.1
Expansion Projects                     9              66.3
Projects Eligible for only ERP and
DRC calculations                            48                149.8
of which
New Projects                          20              56.6
Expansion Projects                    28              93.2
Thus, projects eligible for economic rate of return calculations amounted
to 21% by number and 43% by amount of ICICI total assistance to all projects
during this period.

Methodology
3.   (a)  Little/Mirlees
ICICI used the same methodology for these most recent studies
as it had in its own preparation of the Special Study. The following
were the most important assumptions:
(i) International prices were used to value where possible
tradeable inputs and outputs;
(ii) In the case of non-tradeables, a Standard Conversion
Factor (SCF) of 1.5 was used;
(iii) A shadow wage rate of 0.5 was utilized throughout based
on prevailing norms regarding the industrial wage rate,
the marginal product of an average worker in rural areas,
and the average savings rate out of wages;
(iv) Cost and benefit valuations were based on the cash
flow assumptions in the appraisal reports based on
constant prices and a normal year of production. Plant
and machinery were assumed to have zero scrap value at
the end of project life, buildings were valued at 33%
of their original cost, land at 100%, and the total
working capital was added back.
(b) Effective Rates of Protection
Two sets of calculations were made, namely Balassa
method (where non-traded inputs were valued at domestic
prices) and the Corden method (where non-traded inputs
were included as part of value added).
Major Findings
4.        A sunmary of the major findings of the economic analysis is
contained in Attachments 1 through 3. As can be seen from Attachment 1,
the weighted average economic rate of return for the 39 projects was
20.3% compared to financial rates of return of 14.0%. In 28 of the
39 cases, the economic rate of return exceeded the financial rate of
return. None of the 39 projects showed economic rates of return of
less than 8% while 15 of the 39 projects enjoyed rates of return in
excess of 20% (Attachment 2).
5.        The projects with the highest economic rates of return belong
to industry groups such as sugar, textiles, and ferrous and non-ferrous
metal products. The basic reasons for the high rates of return in these
industries were:



ANNEX 22
Page 3
(a) a preponderance of raw materials in operating costs
which gave higher value added at world rather than
domestic prices;
(b) The projects were labor intensive and with the shadow
wage rate of 0.5, labor costs at world prices were low;
and
(c)  The proportion of non-ttadeables in operating costs was
high, which with a standard conversion factor of greater
than one, showed a higher value added at world rather
than domestic prices.
6.        At the other end of the scale, the projects with lower rates of
return suffered from an unfavorable relationship between input and output
prices internationally compared to domestically, low capacity utilization
in some cases and less than optimal scale of output.

INDUSTRIAL CREDIT FOR INVESTMENT CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED
ICICI's Financing Strategy
(Prepared by ICICI and reviewed by its Board and GOI)
1.        ICICI's industrial assistance and its composition over the years
have followed a pattern reflecting fairly closely the current priorities
of the country in the industrial field. The early years of ICICI, saw the
emergence of active policies towards broadening and deepening the
industrialization process in the country. In tune with this,ICICI's own
financing, then and to a significant extent even now, has been towards
the building up of the country's non-traditional industries while support
to the traditional industries has been generally restricted to their
modernization and balancing needs.
2.        At the project financing stage,ICICI assisted projects now
undergo systematic examination of their viability in terms of their
international competitiveness on the basis of tools in use at the wTorld
Bank and elsewhere. ICICI financed projects, both past and present, have
generally indicated fairly satisfactory economic returns, whether they
belonged to non-traditional or traditional industries, and whether import
substituting or export earning.
Past Operations
3.        ICICI's industrial financing during the first ten years of its
operation - when the country was building up a new industrial structure
and when the new industries were largely connected with strengthening
the intermediate and capital goods manufacturing base in the country -
was mainly directed to projects of import substitution. Several of these
new industries - wire ropes, steel tubes, hand tools, wire rods and wagons,
to mention only a few - became export earners in the subsequent years.
ICICI's fairly substantial assistance to the modernization prpgram in the
textile industry largely went to companies which had been and had continued
to be important exporters of textiles.
4.        As compared to the earlier years, when certain sectors like
machinery and engineering goods, paper and cement claimed a considerable
share of ICICI assistance, in the later years, basic chemicals (including
petro-chemicals), fertilizers, alloy and special steels, heavy duty tyres,
hotels and shipping assumed a greater weight in ICICI operations.
Modernization and export oriented investments connected with the textile
industry have continued to absorb a sizeable portion of ICICI assistance.
Among the newer claimants of ICICI assistance are the leather processing
industry and electronics which have a significant potential for export.
Need for Overall Growth
5.        A healthy industrial sector in the country will require
uninterrupted growth on a broad front to be able to cope up with the
diversified demands made on it by exports and the growing input needs
of Indian agriculture. The industrial sector has also to play an adequate



ANNEX 32
Page 2
role towards enlarging the supply of manufactured goods of mass consumption
essential for dealing with the price inflation in the country.
6.        Taking specifically the question of securing a rapid expansion of
the countryts industrial exports, a sector which is likely to receive
priority attention for many years to come, the basic requirement here is
that any sustained export effort is possible only on the basis of an
overall balancedindustrial growth. Thus the conditions most favorable
for exports are those permitting a continuous increase in domestic
capacity and production.
7.        Equally, the opportunities that are now offered by the high
income markets of the Middle East are capable of being exploited only
when India's industrial capacity itself grows at a sufficient pace to
take care of both domestic demand and the rising consumption and capital
goods requirements of these markets. Thus, industrial priorities or
selective channelization of resources in particular fields must remain
consistent with the realization of other complementary objectives.
New Priorities
8.        ICICI's financing policies will continue to be in line with the
national priorities, more so in the immediate future, in view of the current
economic difficulties of the country and the resource constraints that
have held up the implementation of the Fifth Plan.
9.        At present,several of the Fifth Plan priorities are undergoing
a revision and it will be some time before these acquire a formal shape.
At the same time, there are certain ascertainable national priorities
within the industrial field, and from this angle the areas requiring a
considerable stepping up of investment would comprise:
(a) export industries and supporting activities;
(b) coal, power and transport, including ancillaries
connected therewith;
(c) agricultural inputs and outputs;
(d) industries basic to industrial expansion and serving
a wide spectrum of uses such as caustic soda, soda ash,
alloy and special steels and machine tools;
(e) mass consumption goods which need to be available in
adequate quantity to contain inflation;
(f) balancing and modernization program contributing to
higher output and productivity both in new and in old
industries.



ANNEX 32
Page 3
10.       A classification of ICICI's rupee and foreign exchange
operations during the period 1973 and 1974 would indicate
that roughly 80% of its assistance was to the six groups of industries
mentioned above. The remaining assistance went principally to a large
variety of industries contributing to industrial self sufficiency and
progressive import substitution, many of which having linkages to the
six groups of production activities mentioned above.
11.       Any precise quantification of ICICI assistance for priority
industries in the sense of laying down   sector-wise targets will not
serve the national objectives adequately and will only inhibit ICICIs role
as a development institution. There are changing urgencies in regard to
industrial investment and growth to which ICICI would like to respond
requiring flexibility of approach in the disposition of its funds.
12.       ICICI's financing policies, as seen from its past operations
and the new priorities indicated above, will reflect awareness of prime
objectives in the industrial field as reorganized by the Government
of India and the World Bank, keeping in view needs of sectoral development
as well as requirements of balanced industrial growth.

from 1974 (actual) to 1978 (20% for 1973). The total debt/equity ratio includes
as debt both current liabilities as well as the portion of the long term debt
maturing within a year. The debt/equity ratio (Bank definition) excludes from
debt the portion of the long term debt maturing within one year.
