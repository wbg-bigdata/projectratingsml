PREFACE
1. This document is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Power
Rehabilitation and Extension Project in the Republic of Togo, for which Credit 2171-TO
in the amount of SDR 11.4 million (US$ 15 million equivalent) was approved on
September 12, 1990 and made effective on January 3, 1991.
2. The Credit was closed on March 31, 1999, compared to the original date of December
31, 1994. Final disbursement took place on May 4, 1999 at which time the total amount
of available funds in the Credit was disbursed.
3. The ICR was prepared by Mr. Etienne N'Guessan (Power Engineer, Consultant). The
ICR was reviewed by Messrs. Noureddine Bouzaher, Said R. Mikhail, and Ms. Colleen
de Freitas.
4. Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's final supervision mission to Togo
from June 3 to 11, 1999. The ICR is based on the appraisal report, supervision missions
reports, mid-term evaluation report, correspondence between the Borrower and the Bank,
during project implementation and other material available in the Bank's project files.
The Borrower contributed to the ICR by preparing its own evaluation of project
implementation attached to the ICR as Appendix B.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1. The Power Rehabilitation and Extension Project was a follow up to the Nangbeto
hydroelectric project, which was approved in 1984 to help CEB (Benin Electric
Company)-- the wholesale power company jointly owned by Togo and Benin -- increase
its capacity and improve its operations. Serious deficiencies remained, however, in the
management of the two national utilities, CEET (Togo Electrical Energy Company) in
Togo and SBEE (Benin Electricity and Water Company) in Benin. Two projects were
formulated to correct these deficiencies, including the project under review.
Project Objective
2. The objective of the project was to correct deficiencies in the power sector by: (i)
streamlining the relationship between CEET and the Government (GOT); (ii) reinforcing
CEET's organization, and effecting improvements in all aspects of operations, including
the introduction of a performance contract with specific efficiency targets between CEET
and the GOT; (iii) financing part of the investment program of the power sector for the
period 1990-1994 including rehabilitation, reinforcement and extension of the
distribution grid, as well as the connection of new loads.
Implementation Experience and Results
3. In December 1990, the Government enacted a law to bring more efficiency in the
management of state-owned companies, by giving them more management autonomy.
Subsequently, a performance contract was signed between CEET and GOT covering the
period 1991-1995, and containing specific targets to be achieved by CEET, as well as
obligations for the Government to pay its bills on time. A new board was set up. A
number of studies were executed during project implementation for improving the



management of CEET and prepare the extension and rehabilitation of its network. Most
of the planned investment program was executed, with the exception of the rehabilitation
of CTL (Lome Thermal Power Station), the thermal unit in Lome, and the related
transmission line.
4. Implementation of the project was much delayed by the political crisis that crippled
Togo from late 1990 to 1993. Modem sector activities were brought to a standstill, and
as a result, the performance of CEET deteriorated. The devaluation of the CFA franc in
January 1994 contributed to further imbalance CEET's financial results. During the mid-
term review of July 1996, the government of Togo, confronted with heavy losses for
CEET in 1994 and 1995, agreed with IDA on the privatization of CEET. A management
contract was signed with a private operator in 1997, bids for a concession were requested
in 1999, and a concession agreement is expected to be signed in early 2000.
5. The project outcome is marginally satisfactory and its sustainability uncertain. The
performance of CEET in all aspects of its operations almost five years after the initial
closing date of the credit is far below the targets set at appraisal for 1995. On the other
hand, CEET will be privatized, which represents a major breakthrough.  The
sustainability of the project hinges upon the restoration of a more favorable
macroeconomic framework, and an adequate performance of the yet untested regulatory
authority in the sector.
Lessons from experience
*  The first and most important lesson learned is that a performance contract which was
envisaged during the project preparation as a tool for strengthening the institutional
set-up in the sector, has turned out to be not a sufficient tool to improve the
performance of the utility and to reduce Government interference. This was evident
during the Mid-Termn Review (MTR) and an agreement was reached with the
Government for the privatization of CEET. At the time of the project appraisal,
privatization was not an option as the Government and the public opinion in Togo
were not ready for it. The only option remaining, during the MTR, was the
privatization of CEET which was fully accepted and supported by the Government
and later by the staff of the utility.
*  The second lesson is that the performance of a utility is strongly affected by the
overall economic and political environment. Projects should only be undertaken
when a reasonably sustainable sound macroeconomic framework is in place and the
risks of major political disturbances are minimal.
- ii -



*  The third lesson is that a comprehensive mid-term review can help identify problems
and take corrective actions, especially when decisions taken earlier on in the project
design and implementation become less relevant or obstacles to the achievement of
project objectives. Credit closing date extensions used judiciously can help in
bringing new ideas and instruments to bear to ensure sustainability even if they go
beyond the initial objective set for the project (e.g. privatization instead of simply
strengthening the existing utility).
*  Coordination and consultation with donors is vital to the success of a jointly financed
project and for the achievement of project's objectives. A full coordination and a
common approach agreed upon with the project co-financiers, paved the way for the
privatization of CEET.
*  Regional cooperation, including pooling arrangements, and common norms and
standards, can help reduce cost to utilities and improve system reliability. For years,
CEET has depended for its supply on the Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB), a
jointly owned company by Benin and Togo which imports most of its requirements
from Ghana. This system, however, has its drawbacks in case of crisis because of
over reliance on a single source and/or single fuel (in the case of CEET, on hydro-
electricity from Ghana, so that when the drought hit Ghana, the ill effects were also
felt in Togo). Import sources and fuel should be economically diversified to the
extent possible and some indigenous generating capacity should be maintained as
reserve, above and beyond that necessary to supply the load.

PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT BACKGROUND
1.    The Power Rehabilitation and Extension Project was a follow up to the Nangbeto
hydroelectric project, which was approved in 1984 to help CEB -- the wholesale power
company jointly owned by Togo and Benin -- increase its capacity and improve its
operations. Serious deficiencies remained, however, in the management of the two
national utilities, CEET in Togo and SBEE in Benin. Two projects were formulated in
the late 1980s to correct these deficiencies, including the project under review.
B.    OBJECTIVES
Project Objective
2.    The project objective was to correct deficiencies in the power sector by: (i)
streamlining the relationship between CEET and the Government; (ii) reinforcing
CEET's organization and effecting improvements in all aspects of operations, including
the introduction of a performance contract with specific efficiency targets between CEET
and the State; (iii) financing part of the investment program of the power sector for the
period 1990-1994 including rehabilitation, reinforcement and extension of the
distribution grid, as well as the economically justified connection of new loads.
3.    To achieve this objective, the project included two components:
(a) an institutional development program focussed on the strengthening of
CEET through: (i) a detailed study to define the relationship and to
streamline responsibilities of CEET and the State; (ii) a performance
contract between CEET and the State to improve CEET's efficiency as a



power utility, containing performance targets and incentives for improved
productivity; (iii) a program of technical assistance to CEET and staff
training; (iv) the overhauling of the billing system and provision for new
software for better handling of customers' accounts; (v) the development
of computer-based management information and accounting systems; and
(vi) studies for future system requirements and a tariff study.
(b) an investment program comprising part of CEET's investment program
through 1994 focussing on: (i) the rehabilitation, reinforcement and
extension of the distribution network in the Lome interconnected system,
(ii) the supply and installation of a supervisory control and radio
communications system; (iii) the rehabilitation of the gas turbines in CTL,
the thermal unit in Lome, and (iv) the acquisition of tools, materials, spare
parts and office equipment.
Evaluation of Objective
4.   In the late eighties, CEET was poorly managed and the quality of its services was
deteriorating. Technical and non-technical losses were increasing, reaching over 26
percent of supply in 1989. Limited funds were available for rehabilitation and network
extension/reinforcement. The project was designed to help CEET stem the deterioration
in its technical, managerial and financial performance. The project objective focused on
issues important to the development of the power sector in Togo. It was in agreement
with Togo's structural adjustment program initiated in 1983, and particularly with the
public enterprise reform program supported by the fourth adjustment credit approved by
the Bank in 1990.
C.   ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVE
5.   Implementation of the project, as initially conceived, has been substantially
completed, but with delays, mostly due to the political crisis of the early 1990s. The
expected outputs have been delivered, but, as discussed below, the overall objective of
the project has been only partially achieved.
- 2-



I. INSTITUTIONAL REINFORCEMENT
(a) Streamlining of the relationship between CEET and the Government: Partially
Achieved
6.   In the context of its adjustment program, in December 1990, the Government
enacted a law giving more autonomy to public enterprises and introducing more
transparency in their financial management. Little thereafter, the Government signed a
performance contract with CEET for the period 1991-95. The contract included specific
targets to be achieved by CEET, and committed the Government to pay its bills on time.
A new Board was put in place in 1992. Implementation of the performance contract was
jeopardized, however, by the political turnoil, which crippled economic activities in
Togo from late 1990 to end 1993. The autonomy of CEET was also undermined by the
frequent changes in its top management. The devaluation of the CFA franc in January
1994 contributed to a deterioration in CEET's financial performance. A tariff increase of
20 per cent was approved starting on July 1995. CEET was on its way to recovery, but,
with renewed political tensions following charges of fraud in the June 1998 presidential
elections, the management of the economy has sharply deteriorated, resulting in the
accumulation of new arrears by Government. This is a serious issue that is not yet fully
resolved.
7.    The privatization of CEET was not envisaged when the project was approved.
During project implementation, however, it became clear that the changes brought about
under the institutional development component would not be sufficient to stem the
serious deterioration in CEET's performance, which took place in 1994-95. In 1994,
revenues from sales covered only 56 percent of operating expenses. In 1995, the situation
deteriorated further but it showed how much more was needed to make CEET a self-
standing utility. During the mid-term review of the project in July 1996, the Bank and
GOT agreed that the only way to salvage the power sector was through the privatization
of CEET. A study was launched in march 1997 to examine the feasibility of introducing
private investors in the distribution of electricity in Togo, and make proposals for the
reorganization of the sector. The conclusions of this study were approved by the
Government, and an information seminar was organized to brief key officials, customers
representatives, CEET staff and the workers' union. CEET was immediately put under
private management in Spring 1997 to await the completion of the selection process of a
private concessionnaire to take over CEET. This is expected to come to closure in early
2000.
-3 -



(b) Program of Technical Assistance and Staff Training: Partially Achieved
8.    Several studies were executed under this component, including: (i) the diagnosis
of CEET, designed to evaluate its operating system and to define the
rehabilitation/extension needs of the distribution network of the greater Lome area; (ii)
the improvement of customer management designed to physically identify each customer,
clean up the customer file and make a geographical mapping of customers' location in
Lome; (iii) the optimization of spare parts management, including setting up new
standards for equipment for distribution, and development of a computer-based
management of spare parts; (iv) the development of the Strategic Plan of CEET that led
to the setting up of the Financial and Accounting Division; and (v) the development of
computer-based management information and accounting systems. CEET staff was
associated to the implementation of these studies, but there was no systematic staff
training.
(c) Development of computer-based management information and accounting
systems: Achieved
9.    Based on the above studies, new  software was acquired to improve the
management of CEET. The development of the new customer management software was
completed in July 1992, enabling CEET to have a complete picture of its relations with
each of its customers. New accounting software named "COBYS" was acquired in 1991.
Software was also acquired for the future development of the distribution network and for
the online management of the low voltage distribution network in the greater Lome area.
Currently, CEET's management systems are fully computer-based, but, further staff
training is needed to ensure an efficient use of the new systems.
(d) Studies for the future system requirements: Achieved
10.   Several studies were executed under this component. The rural electrification
Master Plan study began in November 1994 and was completed in July 1996. A study
was carried out for the electrification of about 100 villages, some of which are located
along the route of the 161 kV transmission line expected to be built from Atakpame to
Kara. The tender documents for the project have been prepared. A study helped CEET
define standards and normalize distribution equipment. Another study led to the
introduction of prepaid meters to discourage fraud. A tariff study was included in the
project, but it was carried out by CEB.
-4-



II. INVESTMENT PROGRAM
(a) Rehabilitation of CTL's units: Not Achieved
11.   With the exception of the rehabilitation of CTL's gas turbines and related
transmission line, all physical investments were completed or exceeded (Statistical
Tables, Table 5). A consultant was engaged to study the options for the rehabilitation of
CTL. He concluded that the best solution was to let the original constructor rehabilitate
and operate the units. In 1998, however, faced with a critical shortage of power due to
the inability of VRA, the Ghanean wholesale power supplier to CEET (through CEB) to
meet its contractual obligations, CEET had no other alternative but to rehabilitate one of
the gas turbines of CTL. This unit is available and could generate up to 20 MW. GOT is
investigating the best way to put the whole CTL back into operation, probably as a
ROOT (rehabilitate, operate, own and transfer project).
(b) Rehabilitation/Extension of the distribution network: Achieved
12.   Other investments scheduled in the project were completed.  A new radio-
communication system was installed in 1991 and is able to cover most of the southern
region of Togo. The telephone system of CEET was modernized in 1994 and the number
of telephone lines serving CEET's headquarters was increased. A small dispatching
center was put in service in 1996 allowing for the remote control of the distribution
network of the greater Lome area. Under the component related to the extension of the
distribution network of the greater Lome area financed by AFD, the French bilateral aid
agency, 25 distribution substations were rehabilitated, 25 new one constructed, and 39 km
of overhead MV line and 299 km of LV distribution line were constructed between
November 1, 1995 and May 31, 1996. In the context of the rehabilitation of the medium
voltage network of Lome financed by AFD, 13 distribution substations were
rehabilitated, 42 new substations were built, and 38 km of underground MV distribution
lines were constructed between January 1995 and March 1996. The last investment
program financed by the Credit and executed during the implementation of the project
concerns connection works on thirty one distribution substations, associated with the
rehabilitation of 33 km of LV distribution line, the construction of 37 km of new LV
distribution line in Lome, the construction of 30 km of 33 kV MV line between Notse and
Agbelouve and the electrification of eight villages located along the routing of the new
line. This program also included the acquisition of a meter calibrating unit, as well as a
mobile unit for underground cable fault localization.
5-



D.   MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
13.   Four major events outside the control of CEET affected implementation of the
project and the performance of the utility. The social/political crisis of 1990-93 brought
modem sector activities to a standstill. It had a negative influence on CEET's operations
and on project implementation. The devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994
almost doubled the price of all imported goods and equipment. It further affected
CEET's financial viability. While revenues from sales covered on average about 90
percent of operating expenses during 1990-93, this percentage sank to a low 56 percent in
1994. In 1998, because of a serious drought, Ghana was unable to supply power to Togo
for about three months. Finally, renewed political tensions following charges of electoral
fraud in the June 1998 presidential elections led to a reduction in external assistance, and
to a steady deterioration in the management of the economy. Domestic arrears increased
sharply, with negative results for CEET. Project implementation also suffered from the
frequent changes in the top management of CEET. From September 1990 to March
1999, seven General Managers served at CEET, some of them for no more than a short
period.
E.  BANK PERFORMANCE
14.   The Bank's performance in identification, preparation and appraisal was generally
satisfactory. The definition of the objective of the project was clear, even though it
appears now that the amount allocated for investment on the distribution network was
short of the actual needs. Supervision missions were regular but during the crisis of
199 1-1993 the implementation of the entire Togo portfolio was halted. With the
resolution of the crisis in 1994, the Bank extended the closing date of all projects across
the board, including the project under review. The mid-term review of the project
identified that the key development objectives of the project could not be met through the
original project design. On this basis, a second and a third extensions were granted to
June 1998 and to March 1999 on an exceptional basis, respectively, to finance the interim
management and to complete the privatization process of CEET.
F.  BORROWER PERFORMANCE
15.   The performance of the Borrower was not satisfactory.  Contrary to the
commitments it made when the credit was negotiated, the Borrower continued to interfere
with the management of CEET. It kept changing the general managers, with a negative
impact on the performnance of the company. During credit negotiations the Borrower also
agreed to reduce the level of arrears in public sector receivables to no more than the
equivalent of three months' billings. At times the Government has made efforts to pay its
bills and reduce arrears, but the three-month limit was never reached. Confronted with a
- 6 -



disastrous financial situation of the company in mid-1990s, the Borrower eventually
agreed to privatize the management of the utility.
16.   The performance of the utility was marginally satisfactory. However, under
difficult circumstances, it complied with most of the covenants. Procurement was done
according to Bank's guidelines. Periodic reports were issued by CEET. Its accounts
were audited yearly and transmitted to the Bank according to the Project and Credit
Agreements. All scheduled investments have been executed under the supervision of the
project manager and his staff, with or without the technical assistance of consultants. The
financial management of the project was meticulous. Finally, even during the political
crisis of 1990-93, CEET staff have always reported to work and power was not
interrupted.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
17.   Most project components have been implemented, and despite a difficult
environment, CEET is now a stronger utility than it was at project inception. To improve
CEET's performance, the project sought to reduce government interference in its
management and to reinforce its internal organization. The signing of a performance
contract between the Government and CEET was expected to give CEET more autonomy
and a clear road map for enhancing its technical and financial performance. It did not
work, however, as the 1990-93 political crisis in Togo had a negative impact on all
modern sector activities.  More radical solutions were needed, and in 1996 the
Government decided to privatize CEET.
18.   The overall outcome of the project is rated marginally satisfactory.  The
privatization of CEET represents a major progress, not foreseen at appraisal. The project
helped build the foundations for an improved operation of the utility. On the other hand,
the overall environment has not been conducive to the improved performance expected at
appraisal. Major deterioration of CEET performance happened due to the social and
political unrest of 1991-93 which was followed by the FCFA devaluation of January
1994. The drought of 1998 and the recent reduction of external assistance to Togo by
donors were also major factors in CEET's poor financial performance. However, the
private management of CEET made it possible for the company to return to its 1989-90
performance level. Nevertheless, there has been no significant reduction in losses, and no
progress on payment by Government of its electricity bills. The cost of electricity to
consumers is still high, at about USc 13 per kWh on average.

H.   SUSTAINABILITY OF PROJECT
19.   The sustainability of the project is uncertain. The project has helped CEET
develop the tools required for a more effective management of its technical and financial
operations. The utility is being privatized and its performance has improved in the past
two years. Under normal circumstances, the investment made should be sustainable, but
the serious deterioration of Togo's economic management in the recent past is a major
factor of uncertainty for the utility. Government arrears have accumulated at a rapid pace
in the past year. After a solid recovery in 1994-97, the Togolese economy is again
declining, which does not provide a supportive environment for improving the
performance of the utility. Another element of uncertainty is the performance of the
regulatory authorities, following the effective privatization of the utility.
I.    FUTURE OPERATION
20.   During project implementation, institutional, financial and technical arrangements
to ensure effective operation of the project have been in place as part of CEET's normal
operations. The performance indicators that were used during implementation of the
project should be maintained and used as part of the Bank's ongoing dialogue with the
Government. The experience and the know-how acquired by CEET during project
implementation represent an important element of its capacity building efforts. For these
efforts to bear fruit, however, it is important that the investment climate in Togo improve
rapidly, which in turn depends on a solution to the political crisis, which erupted after the
presidential elections of June 1998.
21.   The restructuring of the power sector that was agreed with the Governuent after
the MTR and is now being implemented, has opened the sector to private investors in
Power Generation and IPPs. Support to new IPPs as well as to the private
concessionnaires for the Distribution System could be provided through the future power
sector investment operation.
J.    KEY LESSONS LEARNED
22.   The first and most important lesson learned is that a performance contract which
was envisaged during the project preparation as a tool for strengthening the institutional
set-up in the sector, has turned out to be not a sufficient tool to improve the performance
of the utility and to reduce Government interference. This was evident during the Mid-
Term Review (MTR) and an agreement was reached with the Government for the
privatization of CEET. At the time of the project appraisal, privatization was not an
option as the Government and the public opinion in Togo were not ready for it. The only
option remaining, during the MTR, was the privatization of CEET which was fully
accepted and supported by the Government and later by the staff of the utility.

23.   The second lesson is that the performance of a utility is strongly affected by the
overall economic and political environment. Projects should only be undertaken when a
reasonably sustainable sound macroeconomic framework is in place and the risks of
major political disturbances are minimal.
24.   The third lesson is that a comprehensive mid-term review can help identify
problems and take corrective actions, especially when decisions taken earlier on in the
project design and implementation become less relevant or obstacles to the achievement
of project objectives. Credit closing date extensions used judiciously can help in bringing
new ideas and instruments to bear to ensure sustainability even if they go beyond the
initial objective set for the project (e.g. privatization instead of simply strengthening the
existing utility).
25.   Coordination and consultation with donors is vital to the success of a jointly
financed project and for the achievement of project's objectives. A full coordination and a
common approach agreed upon with the project co-financiers, paved the way for the
privatization of CEET.
26.   Regional cooperation, including pooling arrangements, and common norms and
standards, can help reduce cost to utilities and improve system reliability. For years,
CEET has depended for its supply on the Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB), a
jointly owned company by Benin and Togo which imports most of its requirements from
Ghana. This system, however, has its drawbacks in case of crisis because of over reliance
on a single source and/or single fuel (in the case of CEET, on hydro-electricity from
Ghana, so that when the drought hit Ghana, the ill effects were also felt in Togo). Import
sources and fuel should be economically diversified to the extent possible and some
indigenous generating capacity should be maintained as reserve, above and beyond that
necessary to supply the load.

APPENDIX A: MISSION'S AIDE-MEMOIRE
PROJET DE REHABILITATION ET D'EXTENSION DU RESEAU
DE DISTRIBUTION ELECTRIQUE AU TOGO
Credit 2171 - TO
AIDE-MEMOIRE
MISSION DE SUPERVISION
1.    Une mission de la Banque mondiale composee de Messieurs Said Mikhail,
ingenieur electricien senior, Colleen de Freitas, analyste des operations, Etienne
N'Guessan, ingenieur 6lectricien (consultant) et Nourredine Bouzaher, economiste, a
sejourne au Togo du 3 juin au  1I juin, 1999. L'objectif de la mission etait de faire le suivi
du processus de privatisation de la CEET et de preparer le rapport d'achevement du projet
en cours. La mission tient A remercier la CEET pour son accueil et sa collaboration.
Preparation du rapport d'achevement du Credit 2171-TO
2.    La mission a discute du contenu du rapport d'achevement avec la CEET et leur a
fourni une copie des directives de la Banque. Le calendrier suivant a ete adopte:
Action                   Responsabilit6    Date
Preparer et soumettre a l'IDA: (i) le plan pour le
fonctionnement du projet; (ii) la contribution de  CEET  15 juin 1999
1'emprunteur ; et (iii) les tableaux 5, 6, 7, 8A et 8B.
IDA preparera et soumettra pour commentaires a la
CEET la version preliminaire du rapport   IDA            2 juillet 1999
d'achevement
Finalisation du rapport d'achevement      IDA            31 juillet 1999
3.    Puisque le projet est essentiellement compose de materiel de distribution
electrique, le plan de fonctionnement du projet s'appliquera A ces composantes dont la
rentabilite peut etre evalu6e (elles contribuent A l'augmentation des ventes et necessitent
des depenses d'entretien). L'Agence Francaise de Developpement, (AFD), sera invitee A
commenter la version preliminaire du rapport d'achevement.



Privatisation de la CEET
4.    La mission a pris note de l'evolution du processus de privatisation de la CEET.
Cette composante n'etait pas initialement inclue dans le projet. L'evolution de la gestion
de la CEET l'a rendue necessaire et la mise en oeuvre des reformes a ete rendue possible
par l'engagement politique du Gouvemement du Togo. Le rapport d'achevement mettra
l'accent sur cet important changement dans le secteur de l'energie electrique au Togo.
Audit des Comptes 1998 et Situation Financiere
5.    La mission a discute de l'etat d'avancement de l'audit des comptes et des etats
financiers pour 1'exercice 1998. Les auditeurs sont en train de finaliser leur audit et la
mission a re,u des assurances que le rapport d'audit parviendra a la Banque le 30 juin
1999, au plus tard.
6     Les etats financiers provisoires (en cours d'audit) font apparaitre un benefice
d'exploitation de 1.028 millions de FCFA et un resultat beneficiaire de 1.010 millions de
FCFA. Les comptes clients ont evolue favorablement en 1998: le solde du compte
general clients est passe de 20 milliards de FCFA en debut d'exercice a 12,6 milliards a
fin decembre 1998. Les differentes categories de clients ont evolue de la maniere
suivante: (i) le solde du compte administration generale passe de 2.5 a 3 milliards de
FCFA; (ii) le solde du compte societes d'etat qui s'elevait a 9.6 milliards de FCFA en
debut d'exercice a ete reduit a 3 milliards de FCFA en fin d'exercice. Cette evolution
favorable s'explique principalement par des operations de compensation; et (iii) le solde
du compte clients prives a egalement evolue favorablement de 8 a 6.5 milliards de FCFA
au 31 decembre 1998.
7.    Durant le premier trimestre 1999, la tendance pour les clients prives s'est
confirmee: le solde de ce compte est de 6 milliards de FCFA au 31 mars 1999. Par
contre, les societes d'etat et l'administration n'ont pas evolue dans le meme sens (une
augmentation de pres d'un milliard de FCFA). Une operation de compensation est en
cours afin de resorber cette augmentation de ces comptes clients.
Modele Financier de la CEET
8.    La mission a egalement discute de la preparation du modele financier et des
perspectives financieres de la CEET suite a la privatisation de la compagnie. Ce modele
pourra servir a l'elaboration de divers scenarios tenant compte de l'evolution de
parametres cles tels que la demande, les tarifs et les charges.

9.    Probleme informatique du passage a l'an 2000. La CEET a pris des dispositions
pour faire face a ce probleme. Un comite travaillant sur differents aspects de ce probleme
avait e  mis en place des l'annee derniere. Toutes fois, il subsiste le probleme de
financement des mesures prevues et estimees a 150.000.000 FCFA (environ 300.000
US$). La mission va etudier la possibilite de trouver ce financement.

APPENDIX B: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION
PROJET DE REHABILITATION ET D'EXTENSION DU RESEAU
DE DISTRIBUTION ELECTRIQUE AU TOGO
Credit 2171 - TO
Introduction
Sur requete du Gouvemement Togolais, l'Association Internationale de Developpement a
mis en place le credit 2171-TO d'un montant de 11.400.000,00 DTS pour le financement
du Projet de rehabilitation et d'extension du reseau de distribution electrique au Togo.
Ce credit a ete complete par une contribution de l'Agence Fran,aise de Developpement
(AFD) ancien CCCE a hauteur de 90.000.000,00 FFR.
Objectifs et description du projet
(a) Objectifs initiaux
L'objectif essentiel du projet etait de corriger les principales insuffisances diagnostiquees
dans le secteur electrique par:
1. (Streamline) la revue des relations entre la CEET et le Gouvernement;
2. le renforcement de l'organisation de la CEET y compris Famelioration de tous
les aspects de 1'exploitation et l'introduction 'un contrat de performance
indiquant des objectifs specifiques entre la CEET et le Gouvernement;
3. le financement partiel du programme d'investissement 1990-1994 de la CEET
comprenant la rehabilitation, le renforcement et 1'extension du reseau de
distribution ainsi que le raccordement de nouveaux consommateurs.
(b) Description du projet
Le projet comportait deux volets:
Renforcement Institutionnel: Ce volet devrait permettre de mettre en place
le cadre institutionnel dans lequel la CEET devrait evoluer. II comportait:
- 26 -



Une etude detaillee en vue de definir les relations et les
responsabilites entre la CEET et le gouvernement togolais
*     L'elaboration d'un contrat de performance entre la CEET et le
Gouvemement Togolais en vue d'ameliorer le rendement de la CEET en
tant que entreprise publique, incluant des performances specifiques
pour la periode 1990-1992 et des incitations pour motiver la
productivite;
*     La mise en place d'un programme d'assistance technique et d'un
programme de formation du staff de la CEET
*     Diagnostique du systeme de facturation et acquisition d'un nouveau
logiciel de gestion clientele
*     Mise en place d'un systeme d'information de gestion et d'un
systeme de comptabilite;
*     Une etude tarifaire.
Programme d'investissement: Ce volet devrait pernettre le financement
d'une partie du programme d'investissement de la CEET bas6 notamment sur:
*     la rehabilitation, le renforcement et l'extension du reseau de
distribution sur le systeme interconnecte de Lome;
*     I'acquisition et la mise en place d'un bureau de conduite centralis6
*     I'acquisition d'un systeme de radiocommunication
*     la rehabilitation des turbines A gaz de la CTL
*     I'acquisition de materiels et d'equipements divers d'exploitation
(c,) Evaluation des objectifs dui projet
Mise en ceuvre et Resultats obtenus
Le projet etait con,u pour mettre de l'ordre dans la gestion du secteur par une clarification
des r6les de chaque intervenant, un renforcement des ouvrages de production et de
distribution ainsi qu'une amilioration sensible de la gestion interne de la CEET.
(a) Resultats par rapport aux objectifs initiaux au niveau organisationnel et
institutionnel.
*     Le diagnostic organisationnel mene par le cabinet Arthur D. Little au debut du
projet a permis de faire prendre conscience A tous les acteurs du secteur et
notamment aux personnel de la CEET de tout le potentiel mal utilise dans le
secteur. Certaines des recommandations de ce diagnostic qui ont ete mis en euvre
ont eu un veritable succes.
- 27 -



L'introduction de l'outil informatique demeure de loin le succes le plus
palpable du projet. Depuis le debut du projet plus de 150 micro-ordinateurs ont ete
achetes. Un mini ordinateur IBM AS/400 a e  acquis des 1990 et un second a e
mis en place en 1997.
*     La mise en place du contrat de performance durant la periode 1991-1995 a
constitu6 un reel espoir pour tous les partenaires.
*     Les etudes institutionnelles ont abouti egalement a la modification du statut de
la CEET et a la nomination d'un nouveau conseil d'administration vers la fin de
1992.
Malheureusement, l'ensemble des objectifs n'a pas 6t6 atteint et certains succes sont restes
efemaires. La cause principale est la crise socio-politique que le Togo a traverse entre
1990 et 1994. Mais cette crise n'est pas la seule cause. On note ainsi au passif du projet:
*     La non mise en ceuvre de la formation du personnel.
*     La mise en place d'une politique de responsabilisations des agents au travers
d'une comptabilite budgetaire basee sur les engagements du contrat de performance
a et de courte duree.
*     Le logiciel de gestion des abonnes n'a pas donnr entiere satisfaction. I1 en est
de meme pour le logiciel de gestion des stocks. La mise en place des procedures
qui devrait suivre celle des logiciel n'a pas e faite.
(b) Resultats par rapport aux objectifs initiaux au niveau investissements
Le volet rehabilitation des reseaux a permis de modemiser et de renforcer:
-     Les 3 postes sources de Lome
-     Une quarantaine de poste MT/BT
*    Une cinquantaine de km de reseau MT
*    Une vingtaine de reseau BT
*    Le volet extension de reseau a permis de:
*     Construire .km de reseau MT
*     Construire .km de reseau BT
*     Construire ..... poste MT/BT
*     Mettre en place la teleconduite du reseau MT de Lome
(c) Tableau comparatif des couts reels par rapport aux previsions
(d) Difficultes rencontrees
L'execution du projet a beaucoup ete affecte par le changement permanent des Directeurs
Generaux a la tete de la Compagnie. Entre septembre 1990 date de signature des accords
et mars 1999 date de cl6ture du credit, la CEET a vu passe7 Directeurs Generaux. Le
- 28 -



temps d'expliquer le projet a un Directeur General et qu'il apporte ces amendements, un
nouveau DG est nomme.
Le second point conceme la mise en place d'un reel bureau du projet. Ce bureau s'est en
quelque sorte reduit a une seule personne permanente. Le comptable prevu dans le bureau
de projet a passe moins d'une annee.
(e) Performance de la Banque et de l'Emprunteur
Malgre de petits desaccords de temps en temps, la Banque a toujours su nous comprendre
et delivrer A temps les avis de non objection pour la bonne marche du projet. Les
relations entre la Banque et la CEET vis-a-vis de la gestion du projet ont et en general
satisfaisantes.
L'Emprunteur (Etat Togolais) a respecte en general les engagements pris dans le cadre du
projet. Aucune difficulte particuliere n'est A imputer directement A l'Emprunteur.
(f) Evaluation des resultats finaux du projet
Le projet dans son ensemble a et satisfaisant. La plupart des objectifs principaux a et
atteint. L'apport du projet dans la fiabilisation des r6seaux est tout A fait remarquable. Les
extensions de reseaux effectues par le projet ont permis de subvenir au besoin en
electricite d'une bonne partie de la population de Lome.
Conclusion et recommandation pour les projets futurs
Enseignements tires de la mise en ceuvre du projet
Au niveau du personnel de la CEET, la mise en ceuvre du projet a permis de noter un reel
envi des agents d'apprendre et de se familiariser aux nouvelles techniques (informatique,
Bureau central de conduite etc...). On a egalement note la capacite du personnel A
prendre des responsabilit6s lorsque le systeme est bien organise. Les outils perfectionnes
qui ont ete mis A la disposition du personnel ont e  en general bien utilises.
Au niveau institutionnel, les autorites nationales ont demontre leur disponibilite A
apporter des modification dans le cadre organisationnel et institutionnel pour permettre A
la societe d'&voluer de maniere autonome.
La plus grande le,on demeure l'attente de la population pour avoir l'electricite. A l'arriv6e
de l'electricite, des quartiers entiers se sont batis avec des habitations reelles. Les besoins
se sont accrus et les demandes ne cessent de parvenir A la CEET.
-29 -



Fonctionnement et perennisation des acquis du projet
Pour permettre une bonne exploitation des acquis du projet ainsi que longue vie aux
ouvrages, il est evident que la CEET doit investir sur deux aspects: continuer a former
son personnel et mettre en place une veritable politique de maintenance des ouvrages.
La mise en place d'un systeme de motivation bien pense donnera en plus un gain certains
dans le fonctionnement et la maintenance des ouvrages.
Recommandations pour les futurs projets
L'organisation nationale n'a pas pu profiter de ce projet pour mettre en valeur des
entreprises nationales dans le secteur. Tres peu ou presque pas de cabinets locaux de
consultance n'a et utilise. Pour un futur projet, la conception devra des le depart integrer
cette preoccupation afin de mettre en place un tissu de societe capable de realiser des
reseaux MT et BT.
De meme dans la mise en place d'un futur proj et, la Banque devra etre assez severe sur la
mise en place effective du Bureau du Projet avec les moyens humains et materiel
necessaire pour une bonne gestion du Projet.
