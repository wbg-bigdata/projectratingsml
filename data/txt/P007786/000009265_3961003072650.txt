OF Tax INTE3&TIONAL DEaVLOWIT ASSOCUTION
TO TEE EXECUTrVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA
101 A SOCIAL INVISTET FUNM  PROEWCT
1. I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed credit to the Republic of Nicaragua for SDR17.3 million (US$25
million equivalent) to help finnmce a Social Investment Fund (FISE) project.
The proposed credit would be repayable on standard IDA terms with a maturity
of 40 years, including 10 years of grace. The project would be co-financed by
other donors for US$33.6 million equivalent.
2.    Backgrud_.  Nicaragua, with a population of 3.8 million, is one of the
poorest countries in the Western hemisphere. Its 1990 GNP per capita of less
than US$400 only exceeds that of Guyana. In 1989, poverty affected 551 of the
urban population and over 851 of the rutal population. Infant mortality is
7211,000 live births, due largely to diarrhea and acute respiratory
infections. Nutritional deficiencie* are a contributing factor in 70% of
infant deaths. Health and nutrition indicators reflect the acute problems
facing the Nicaraguan poor: lack of water and sanitation, deficient hygiene
and dietary habits, inadequate empiasis on preventive services at the primary
level of the health system, and a severe deterioration of primary health care
facilities. Education indicators are also critical, with high repetition anc
dropout rates, particularly between the first and second grades (451). There
is a lack of qualified teachers and the education system suffers from a severe
deterioration of existing facilities, particularly in rural areas, lack of
school furniture and equipment, and insufficient teaching-learning materials.
3.    Nicaragua's economy deteriorated sharply during the 1980s as a result of
inappropriate macroeconomic policies and institutional changes toward a
centrally planned economy, ten years of continued civil strife, and a
crippling U.S. trade embargo. By the end of the decade, production was well
below the 1980 level, exports were running at about half of the pre-1980
level, international reserves were depleted, and external debt of US$10
billion, equivalent to seven times GDP; hyperinflation had reached 14,700Z in
1988. The financial system, much of the productive structure, and external
marketing of the principal export products were in the hands of an oversized
public sector. What was left of the private sector after extensive
expropriations, was heavily regulated, and productive capacity diminished for
lack of maintenance and spare parts. Moreover, serious damage had been done
to the country's infrastructure.
4.    Beginning in March 1991, the Govermment of Nicaragua (GON) launched an
economic stabilization program, designed to eliminate hyperinflation, arrest
the decline in GDP, and strengthen the balance of payments through tight
fiscal and monetary policies. The package of economic measures included
devaluation of the currency, reduction of the fiscal deficit through cuts in
government expenditures and tax increases, and tight monetary policy. In
addition, key barriers to private sector participation have been lifted and a
trade liberalization program is underway, including the elimination of public
sector monopolies on importing and exporting activities, and restored access
to foreign exchange by the private sector. Finally, over 100 enterprises have
been already privatized, reducing the share of state-owned enterprises'
production in GDP from 422 in 1990 to 252 in 1991.



-2-
5    While restoring economic growth will ultimately benefit the poor by
increasing per capita incomes, significant reforms are also required to
improve services delivery by the Ministries of Health (KOH) and Education
(MOE). To develop the social reform program, the GONs (i) presented a policy
letter describing its main objectives and broad directions for the sociel
sector-; and (ii) will formulate a comprehensive polic, and strategy document,
based on the policy letter, detailing priority programs and measures to be
pursued over the short and medium term, including an implementation plan.
Presentation by the GON of this document to IDA by May 31, 1993 will be a
performance indicator of the project and reviewed during the mid-term review
(para. 15).
6.   The Social Investoent Fund (WISE).  Because of the need to take short-
term poverty alleviation measures and prevent a deterioration in the already
precarious living standards of the poor duzing the adjustment period, the GON
created FISE in November 1990. FISE has a limited life of five years. It
combines poverty alleviation and employment objectives through the provision
of financing for: (i) social infrastructure subprojects such as
rehabilitation of health posts, schools, water and sewerage systems; (ii)
economic infrastructure subprojects such as public markets, road improvement,
retention walls and drainage works; and (iii) social service subprojects in
health, nutrition, and education targeted to women and young children. WISE
is not an executing, but a financing agency. Subprojects are executed by
decentralized entities such as private local contractors, NGOs,
municipalities, or other public agencies. There have been consistent efforts
to make WISE as effective and efficient as possible, with an independent
Chairman of the Board who comes from the private sector, a high quality
management and staff, and close vigilance by foreign donors. FISE's
operational procedures and practices have been sound and would be strengthened
further under the proposed project. A satisfactory audit of PISE's accounts
for the period ended June 30, 1992 shows its accounts to be in good order.
Under the project, WISE will be audited annually by private external auditors,
acceptable to the Association, who will also undertake a quarterly audit
combining financial review, physical inspection of works, and verification of
procurement for subprojects.  The GON has given strong support to WISE through
a budgetary allocation of US$10 million in 1991 and 1992, which was
complemented by donor resources, but FISE will run out of funds in December
1992 and will need significant additional external financing for its program
in 1993 and 1994. During its first 18 months of operations, FISE approved
funding for 549 projects totalling US$21 million. For 1993, FISE has already
a pipeline of subprojects requiring US$15 million, i.e., about 602 of the
total subproject commitments expected for the year.
7.    FISE-financed subprojects are clearly targeted to the poor.  FISE aims
at a nationwide coverage, but more funds are allocated to poorer
municipalities based on a poverty index composed of displaced population,
child malnutrition, and water supply indicators. Information provided by
VISE's monitoring system will allow WISE to strongthen its promotion in
municipalities where there is a deficit of subprojects and provide technical
assistance for project preparation when necessary.
8. Cost-recovery is one of the important subproject selection criteria and
takes distinct forms depending on the type of subproject. In the case of
social infrastructure, local comittees will be formed and trained to maintain
schools and health facilities financed by FISK. In the case of vater and
sewerage, local communities will set up tariffs and administer revolving funds



- 3 -
to recorer sufficient resources to cover the costs of operation and
maintenance. In the case of social services subprojects, fees would be
charged for those services or items where legally possible; for example,
modest fees for medicines to replenish stocks.
9.    Rationale &or IDA Involvement.  The proposed project fits well with
IDA's country and social sector assistance strategy, which is to provide
technical assistance and financial support for the GON's adjustment and short
term safety net programs, as well as for its efforts to introduce sectoral
policy reforma over the medium term.  The proposed FISE project would
complement a possible future IDA Health project and USAID-financed primary
health care &nd primary education projects, and would also contribute to the
institutional strengthening of the line ministries by sttpporting the MOB and
MOR to develop planning and project preparation and implementation capacity.
IDA support for FISE is corsidered critical to ensure that: (i) the GON's
stabilization and adjustment programs, for which IDA has helped mobilize and
coordinate international donor support, are carried out with support by all
main segments of the population, especially the poor; (ii) lessons learned by
IDA in similar projects in other countries (e.g., Bolivia and Honduras) are
properly transferred to FISEK (iii) sufficient concessional funds are
mobilized from the international donor community to help the CON continue with
its safety net programs; and (iv) the FISE project is defined within an
overall social strategy framcwork.
10. Proiect Obiectives. The project would help the GON sustain its poverty
alleviation efforts and maintain social cohesion during the period of economic
adjustment until line ministries strengthen their institutional capacities and
complete policy reform programs. To the extent feasible, the methods of
operation, procedures, and experience of FISS would be transferred gradually
to social ministries to help them improve their efficiency and equity of
service delivery.
11. Proiect Description. The project would have four components: (i) the
financing, through FISH, of a range of small-scale subprojects in social and
economic infrastructure and social services (US$60.5 million); (ii) technical
assistance to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC) to
implement a Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) program and impact
evaluation of FISE (US$0.9 million); (iii) technical assistance to strengthen
the capacity of MOR and NOR to prepare subprojects (US$1.8 million); and (iv)
technical assistance to help the Government, through the Ministry of Finance
(NOF), to improve budgeting and financial management capacity in the social
ministries (US$0.8 million). Operating costs of the executing agencies would
be US$4.0 million. The proceeds of the credit would be lent to the Republic
of Nicaragua, which would pass on US$23.5 million as a grant to FISE. FISE,
in turn, would use the credit proceeds, jointly with funds from other
international donors and the National Treasury, to finance subprojects through
grants in local communities and implemented by private contractors, NGOs, and
public agencies under the technical supervision of appropriate agencies. The
GON would allocate the balance of US$1.5 million for the implementation of the
technical assistance components of the project.
12. The project cost is estimated at US$68.0 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of US$17.7 million equivalent (26.02). The
proposed IDA credit of US$25.0 million equivalent would finance 36.8S of total
project costs. Retroactive financing of up to US$1.5 million equivalent would
be allowed for eligible expenditures incurre6 since July I, 1992. Funds would
be used for financing a backlog of eligible subprojects approved by FISH in



-4-
line with evaluation criteria acceptable to IDA. A breakdown of costs an1 the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurem.ant
and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing evento and the status of Bank Group
operations in Nicaragua are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 11108-NI, dated October 26, 1992 is also attached.
13. Prolect Imnlementation. The project would be implemented over a period
of about two years. The main executing agency would be PISE for subproject
financing. FISE's staffing criteria and procedures for the identification,
preparation, appraisal, and implementation of subprojects were reviewed by IDA
and are satisfactory. FISE's management is satisfactory to IDA. The other
executing agencies would be INEC for the LSMS, MOB and MOE for the planning,
preparation, and maintenance of subprojects, and MOP for improving budgeting
and financial management capacity in the social ministries in line with GON
social sector strategy (para. 5).
14.   Lessons Prom Previous IDA Involvement.  The following lessons learned
from IDA's experience with SIFs were taken into consideration in the design of
the proposed project. First, FISE was designed as a semi-autonomous
organization to: (i) avoid political influence on management; (ii) allow to
pay competitive salaries &nd recruit high-quality staff; and (iii) allow
simplified procurement procedures which are a necessary condition for fast
subproject implementation. Second, to ensure efficiency and transparency of
operations, FISE's design includes: (i) the use of a standardized menu of
subprojocts resulting in efficient subproject implementation by limiting the
range Q  specialists to F'e recruited by FISE, providing standard parameters
and specifications used by sponsors in subproject preparation, and
facilitating appreisal and supervision of subprojects by FISE staff; (ii) an
operational Manual with clear eligibility and appraisal criteria; (iii) a
targeting mechaaism based on a poverty map using population and poverty
criteria, allowing funds to be allocated to each municipality, and providing
additional funds to poorer municipalities; (iv) additional promotion and
support for subproject preparation to be provided by FISE in poorer
municipalities; (v) annual financial audits and quarterly operational audits
to show FISE'e transparency, an essential element in attracting external
funds; and (vi) a mid-term review to assess project perfonmance and improve
implementation.
15.  Actions Agreed.  During negotiatiogs, agreements were reached as
follows: (i) FISE would use its targeting mechanism, satisfactory to IDA, to
channel more funds to poorer municipalities and that, without IDA's approval,
FISE would not commit more than 181 of funds to Managua and 7X of funds to
other medium poverty municipalities; (ii) the Borrower would provide funds as
indicated in the project financing plan and as needed to cover the operating
costs of the FISE; (iii) any future appointment of the Chairman of the Board
and Executive Director of FISE would be subject to prior IDA approval; (iv)
quarterly and annual audits would be carried out by external auditors on the
basis of acceptable sets of accounts; (v) IDA may refrain from disbursing for
new subprojects when: (a) aggregate limits reach SDR4.6 million by June 30,
1993 and SDR9.2 million by February 28, 1994; and (b) in case of
unsatisfactory progress in project and/or failure to meet performance
indicators; and (vi) the Borrower would carry out a mid-term review of FISE no
later than February 28, 1994, prepare a satisfactory action plan by March 31,
1994, and would implement actions agreed upon as a result of this review in
accordance with the timetable in the plan.



16.   Special Conditions of Effectiveness would be:  (i) a signed technical
ass:stance contract, satisfactory to IDA, between UNDP and FISE; (ii) a
finalized Operational Manual, satisfactory to IDA; (iii) full implementation
of the management information system, satisfactory to IDA; (iv) a signed loan
agreement of US$16 million between FISE and IDB; and (v) signed funding
agreements totalling US$3.5 million equivalent between FISE and other
financiers.
17.   Prosect Benefits.  By providing resources to poor urban and rural
communities, FISE would help to: (i) prevent a deterioration in the living
standard of the poor during the period of economic adjustment; (ii) improve
the social infrastructure so that services can be better delivered and
beneficiaries enjoy better sanitation, and less erosion damage in their
communities; (iii) reduce the rates of mortality, malnutrition, and
illiteracy, particularly among women and children; (iv) strengthen the
Government experience with a decentralized mechanism for delivering
development assistance to municipalities and small businesses and mobilizing
grass-roots efforts, which could subsequently be used by other agencies; aiid
(v) provide long-term benefits by contributing to institution building by
improving social ministries' capacity to prepare subprojects and their
budgeting and financial management capacity.
18. Environmental Asgects. The project has o B rating. The Operational
Manual of FISE would ensure that subprojects financed by FISE do not adversely
affect the environment. On the basis of this manual, FISE evaluators would
undertake a short environmental impact assessment for each subproject and
ensure that subproject design would include measures to avoid negativ:e
environmental effects.
19.  Risks.  There is a risk that the GuN may attempt to implement the FISE
program with excessive speed, and project funds might be poorly used and
diverted to uses outside the 3cope of the project. The risk would be reduced
by establishing ceilings ensuring that disbursement of IDA funds before the
mid-term review would not exceed about 552 of the total credit amount. A
second risk is the inadequate subproject preparation capacity of line
ministries, municipalities and NGOs. This will be addressed by FISE making
additional promotion efforts and providing subproject preparation assistance
and through technical assistance provided under the project to social
ministries. A third risk is the lack of maintenance of physical facilities
rehabilitated by FISK. This risk will be mitigated by FISe providing
assistance to local communities for maintenance of subprojects, and by
contractual agreements between FISE, line ministries and agencies, and user
committees in charge of maintenance.
20. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
vith the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
