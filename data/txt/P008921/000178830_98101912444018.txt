STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. The Role of Agriculture in the Economy
1.01      Turkish economic development has been predicated on industrial
development, with agriculture playing a supporting but, nevertheless, substan-
tial role. Agricultural development has thus been designed to save the
foreign exchange that would have been necessary to meet the growing domestic
requirement for food and fiber and to earn the foreign exchange needed for
heavy imports of industrial equipment.
1.02      As the country moved towards industrialization, agriculture's share
in GDP declined from 38% in 1963 to less than 25% by 1975. Nevertheless,
agriculture's role is still important: it employs more than 50% of the total
labor force; over 60% of the population are dependent on the sector; it
supplies the country's requirements for grains and most other basic foods;
and produces more than half of Turkey's merchandise exports.
1.03      It has been the aim of Government to make Turkey self-sufficient in
food and fiber. Towards this end, it has long adopted a policy of assuring
agricultural producers a market for their crops at attractive and relatively
stable prices. Accordingly, except for fruits and vegetables, all important
agricultural produce enjoy price supports established and maintained by
the Government.  Guaranteed prices are decreed annually by the Council of
Ministers for each field crop and implementing Government agencies must buy
any quantities offered; however, farmers are free to sell in the open market.
Likewise, except for sugar beet production (where area quotas are set) and
those for opium poppies and tobacco (where production areas are licensed),
farmers are free to make their own production decisions.
1.04      With the incentive of price supports and subsidized inputs, farmers
have quickly adopted new technology: mechanization has been going ahead
rapidly and the use of improved seeds, fertilizers, and farm chemicals have
risen many times over. Turkish agriculture has considerable potential.
Progress has been constrained, however, by inadequate planning and ineffec-
tive program implementation, particularly at the public institutional level.
B. Bank Lending Strategy to the Agricultural Sector
1.05      The Bank's Agricultural Sector Survey Report of September 1977 (ASSR)
concluded that "rational development of Turkish agriculture depends as much
on adequate planning and coordination as it does on the level and choice of
investments." The ASSR recommended that "priority should be given to removing



institutional obstacles that stand in the way of a re-orientation of invest-
ment priorities towards quick-yielding projects, strengthening of technical
and financial support services, and providing a sharper development focus
to price and support policies."
1.06      The proposed Project is in line with the ASSR's recommendation.
The Project aims to strengthen the organization and capabilities of Toprak
Mahsulleri Ofisi (TMO), the official cereal marketing agency. It would
also finance an evaluation of Turkey's agricultural price support and import
subsidy program as well as alternative land-use strategies; this is expected
to develop policies in terms of sector objectives.
C. Project Origin
1.07      A UNDP project executed by FAO in 1975-76 produced a Master Plan
for the grain storage needs of TMO to 1980. The necessity for such a Master
Plan had become apparent because of continuing increases in and the changing
geographical pattern of grain production. The Master Plan, which was then
based solely on the goal of self-sufficiency, recommended the construction of
1.72 million tons of storage and the expansion of the silo facilities at the
port of Izmir to 55,000 tons.
1.08      The Bank expressed interest in financing TMO's storage requirements
at the time and a FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program (CP) mission visited Turkey
in October 1976. By then, however, TMO's storage problem had become so acute
that it obtained approval for Government itself to finance a first-stage much-
needed construction of 530,000 tons of storage facilities.
1.09      In late 1977, renewed Government and TMO interest was expressed for
Bank assistance in fulfilling TMO's additional storage requirements. A CP
mission visited Turkey during May 1978 and submitted a preparation report
to the Bank in August 1978. The Government's proposal to the Bank is based
largely on the CP preparation report. On the basis of this report the project
was appraised in October, 1978 by Messrs. C.E. Eugenio and J.D. McCrary (Bank),
F. Adams, C. Fowler and N. Davey (Consultants).
II. THE CEREALS SUBSECTOR
A. Production and Demand
Production
2.01      Wheat is the staple food grain of Turkey.  Before 1975, the growth
in wheat production 1/ was relatively slow and Turkey still had to import to
keep up with domestic demand. Since 1975, however, three successive years of
good harvest have quickly enabled Turkey not only to be self-sufficient in
1/   Wheat is the commodity almost exclusively dealt with by TMO.

wheat but to become an exporter, as well.  The following table shows selected
wheat production statistics during the years 1965-1977:

The average compound rate of increase in the ten year period 1965-1974 was
almost 3%, while the three year period 1975-1977 was 14.8%; overall, the rate
was 5.5%.
2.02      The continuing rise in production is undoubtedly due to the price
support program which has encouraged farmers through attractive wheat support
prices and the existence of a Government agency to which they can readily
turn to to sell their produce.  Farmers were thus enabled in most cases to
adopt modern technology (including the use of improved seeds, fertilizers,
and farm chemicals) and to increase the area in wheat made possible by the
mechanization of many farms.  It is important to note from Table 2.1 that
while technology has raised average yields, the possibility remains of sub-
stantial production variation due to weather and that the range of this
variation is likely to expand considerably under improved technology. 1/
Nevertheless, future production of wheat (and other cereals) is importantly
dependent on future price policy. For this and other reasons, Turkey's price
support program has been the subject of a UNDP sponsored study 2/ which must,

however, be taken another step forward by evaluating the agricultural consumer
price support and input subsidy program as well as alternative land-use
strategies consistent with Turkey's future objectives.
2.03      Increases in wheat production are expected to continue.  In many
areas, the production impact resulting from the use of improved seeds, fertil-
izers, and farming machinery is a reality; their use are spreading to less.
advanced areas. While it is the national policy to ensure self-sufficiency in
wheat, it is, however, not presently the Government's plan to make Turkey a
major wheat exporting country. The State Planning Organization (SPO) states
that it would endeavor to keep the country's exports at the 2 to 2.5 million-
ton range. Government support programs in the future affecting cereals
production cannot be forecasted with certainty; nevertheless, it would be
safe to assume that Government would continue to see to it that the fact of
self-sufficiency already attained would, at least, be maintained.
2.04        Official statistics (Table 2.1) show that average annual produc-
tion (representing the two lowest and two highest years of production) during
1968-77 was about 13.2 million tons. Using this as a basis and conserva-
tively applying the 3% growth rate derived from Table 2.1, 1/ annual produc-
tion should reach about 19.4 million tons by 1985. Consequent implications on
TMO storage requirements are discussed in paras. 2.16 to 2.22.
2.05        Future production of cereals other than wheat is less predictable;
however, it is equally dependent on future price policy. The development of
intensive livestock farming would result in an expanded market for coarse
grains, 2/ especially barley. Most non-wheat cereals are not marketed and
TMO's role in them for the present is minimal.
Demand
2.06      Wheat is consumed mostly in the form of bread although consumption
in the form of pasta and pastry is also significant. In 1975, a TMO survey
of 3,512 families found that per capita annual wheat consumption averaged 215
kg, not far from the 225 kg per capita used in official estimates. These
figures represent a remarkably high consumption level when compared to ASSR's
suggestion of a much lower figure of 135 kg per capita. In the absence of a
more encompassing survey and reliable figures of production and consumption,
there is no way of verifying which figures are correct. Be that as it may,
the fact remains that whereas prior to the 1975/76 harvest Turkey was a net
1/ This is also the growth rate derived in the ASSR from a three-year
moving trend analysis of Government production figures for the period
1963/64/75 through 1973/74/75, which includes the first of the "good
weather" years (1975) but not the subsequent even better ones.

ment for Bank assistance.

importer of grain, beginning with that year, it became self-sufficient in
wheat (although still importing about 118,000 tons of barley) and, thereafter,
it became an exporter, selling abroad in 1977/78, for instance, 1.5 million
tons and 100,000 tons of wheat and barley, respectively.
2.07      Internal consumption of wheat during 1968-77 has been estimated to
average about 13.0 million metric tons per year, and reached 15.0 million tons
in 1977. This figure includes all uses such as seed, livestock feed, and
human consumption.  The annual rate of increase in consumption is estimated at
about 2%. 1/ At this rate, yearly consumption by 1985 is predicted at 16.8
million metric tons.
B. Marketing
Private Sector Marketing
2.08      The cereals trade in Turkey is a mixture of private and public
sector activities, each of them significant. Of the total wheat production,
2/ it is estimated that a little over a half is consumed locally; of the
remainder, about one-half is marketed privately and the rest by Toprak
Mahsulleri Ofisi (TMO).
2.09      Private grain marketing represents that part which is not covered
by TMO's supply to the municipalities of 10 kg per month per head of popula-
tion. TMO wheat must be milled at an extraction rate of at least 90% and the
end products sold at controlled prices. Wheat from private sources is used
for white bread and other high quality bakery products which enjoy "free"
prices. Generally, millers obtain their free market supplies directly
from producers (also some from TMO; see para. 2.11), middlemen play only a
small part. Those producers who choose not to sell to TMO tend to be the
larger farmers who can hold grain on their farms for better prices. Others
sell at a slightly lower price to avoid the delay in crowded TMO depots at
harvest time. Conservatively, it was assumed under the Project that TMO would
continue to market no more than its past share (25%) of total production, thus
assuming in effect that private sector capabilities and facilities would grow
at the same rate as TMO's.
1/   The ASSR suggests wheat demand growth rates of 1.8% for food consumption
and 1.5% for all uses including food. The rate of 2% used here is in the
same magnitude as the ASSR prediction but is more conservative in the
*              sense that it tends to underestimate TMO's storage requirements.  Although
the population growth rate is an estimated 2.6% p.a., the 2% rate used
is considered adequate in view of the rising standard of living, par-
ticularly in urban areas, resulting in replacement of wheat by other
foods.
2/   The production and marketing of coarse grains is of very minor importance
compared to wheat.

TMO and Public Sector Marketing
2.10       Organization, Responsibilities, and Finance.  The public sector role
in cereals marketing is the responsibility of TMO. 1/ Established in 1938 as
a State Economic Enterprise (SEE), it operates under the general supervision
of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock. It is directed by a
Government-appointed Board of Directors, maintains a main office in Ankara
and a country-wide network of nine regional offices, 220 local buying offices,
and a variable number of temporary buying points.  Its policy is to locate
buying offices as close as possible to centers of production.
2.11       TMO's essential functions with respect to cereals are:  to buy from
producers any quantities offered at official prices (set annually by the
Council of Ministers); to store grain for later sales and for national reserve
requirements; to supply approved users (flour mills, armed forces, etc.), also
at official prices; after supplying approved users, to sell in the open market
for the purpose of stabilizing prices; and, as the sole entity authorized to
do so, import or export as may be appropriate.
2.12       Although it has its own Board of Directors (all members appointed
by Government), TMO's functions are circumscribed by law, decrees, and
policies formulated by MA and the Council of Ministers. For all purposes,
TMO is a Government bureau performing a governmental service whose policy
decisions and lines of activities are determined by Government. For instance,
with TMO's buying and selling prices for grains determined by the Council of
Ministers, trading losses are unavoidable and outside its control. Naturally,
TMO is reimbursed from the Treasury for all such losses; these amounted to
TL 733 million, TL 118 million, and TL 1,379 million in 1975, 1976, and 1977
respectively. Nevertheless, TMO has managed to show profits from its opera-
tions in the free market. During fiscal years 1975 to 1977, for instance, TMO
showed net gains of TL 49, 56, and 376 millions, respectively, after being
reimbursed by the Treasury for trading losses in the years mentioned above.
2.13       TMO's paid-in capital of TL 600 million has remained constant
in recent years while its volume of grain trading has greatly increased.
Operations have been financed by short-term funds from the Central Bank (at
1.25% interest p.a.) and interest-free loans from the Treasury. The 530,000
tons of new storage under construction is being financed by a long-term loan
from the Government. TMO's equity position is unimpaired, having grown from
TL 722 millions at end 1974 to TL 839 million at end 1976.
2.14       Domestic Marketing.  Grain is normally brought to TMO by farmers
and payment is made on delivery. Since TMO's prices are fixed for the entire
season, producers normally have no interest in delaying delivery after harvest.
This means that virtually all purchasing in a particular area is completed
within two months, resulting in congestion at delivery points. On the sales
side, TMO's basic obligation is to supply wheat for the needs of each munici-
pality up to the equivalent of 10 kg per month per head of population. Wheat
is sold to millers who then sell the flour to bakeries. TMO's storage require-
ments, therefore, has to serve both producing and consuming areas.
1/   TMO is also the Government's sole agency in the purchase, storage, and
export of poppy heads in the production of opium products.



2.15      Import and Export Operations.  Up to 1974, Turkey was an importer of
wheat and TMO handled all operations up to delivery to millers. Beginning
with 1975, this changed dramatically. Recently, TMO had an export program
involving deliveries of 2.5 million tons in 18 months to end 1978; shipments
on a comparable scale are expected to continue in 1979. Not being a regular
shipper to world markets, Turkey has been obliged to accept selling prices
well below those obtained by established exporting countries. Sales terms
would no doubt improve if TMO could attain stricter standards of quality and
could improve its capacity for regular and punctual deliveries.  For the
Project, it has been assumed that TMO would export around 2.5 million tons
annually at most, a modest figure given the level of its present exports.
2.16      Storage Requirements.  TMO's annual purchases and sales since 1974/75
have been as follows (in '000 tons):

Because of the rising wheat purchases from 1975/76, stocks were accumulated
and an increasing portion of the purchases were stored in the open air. After
the harvest of 1977, for instance, more than 5 million tons were in open stor-
age, on the ground, with only the protection of chopped straw, polyethylene
sheeting, and a covering of soil. While open storage is acceptable under
emergency and/or temporary conditions, quality and physical losses are signif-
icant when stocks have to be stored for a long time (especially the case in
deficit areas) and in the more humid coastal regions (especially in the
Istanbul and Iskenderun regions).
2.17      Without the Project, TMO would have available about 1,630,000
tons of storage facilities (1,600,000 tons of existing storage, less 500,000
tons of facilities which would soon become obsolete, plus 530,000 tons of
horizontal warehouses now under construction and expected to be finished by
end 1979). Assuming annual purchase of 4.5 million tons 1/ by 1985 (2.0
*         million tons for domestic consumption and 2.5 million tons for export),
massive amounts of grain would be in open storage with consequent larger
losses if additional storage was not built.

2.18       Pending study of Turkey's agricultural price support and input
subsidy programs and land-use strategies proposed under the Project (para.
3.13) and because of possible financial, construction, and operational con-
straints, the Project proposes construction of 860,000 tons of inland facili-
ties and 50,000 tons of port facilities, as a first-phase program representing
a time slice of a larger program of inland storage facilities. Even if the
implementation of the study's findings result in slowing down production
growth, it is expected that TMO will still require to build 2 million tons of
storage by the mid-1980's.  This first-phase program was analyzed to determine
its sensitivity to various factors and to this end a simulation model of
future production, consumption and TMO purchases and sales was developed. One
thousand 15-year time period simulations of these parameters were made and
each sample was analyzed to determine the time-history impact on storage
utilization, exports, and imports. A brief description of the model and a
summary of the results follow.
2.19      Data for the past fifteen years was utilized to generate a statis-
tical "predictive" model of future production and consumption of wheat and
the consequent implications on TMO purchases and sales. The key assumption
in such a model is, of course, that the major factors that influence these
parameters (e.g., weather, technological improvements, area under production,
Government policy) will not experience major qualitative changes other than
those reflected by the past fifteen years. That is not to say that these
factors will remain constant, but rather that the magnitudes of changes
that these factors experienced in the past is a reasonable predictor of the
magnitude of changes they will experience in the future. There is, however,
an underlying trend toward an increase in production, and this trend is
subject to quantitative measure in terms of its expected magnitude as well
as confidence levels associated with any estimated level of increase. The
stochastic model that was used to generate estimates of future conditions
then reflects both the "non-explainable" (i.e., random) components of the
data as well as the trend.
2.20      The necessity for performing such an analysis (as opposed to simply
looking at expected values of future conditions) is due to the rather large
variance in production from year to year and the very significant impact that
this variance has on storage operations. Thus, the model used for the anal-
ysis of future storage conditions, in essence, generated a possible (i.e.,
from the same set of distributions of variables affecting past production)
production sequence for the next fifteen years and evaluated the consequences
of this production sequence on the proposed storage facilities under the
Project; it then generated a second fifteen-year sequence and evaluated the
consequences of it on the Project; a third sequence and so on for one thousand
such sequences.  Implications were thus generated for inland and port storage
utilization, amount of open storage required, possible imports and exports,
and other relevant data. While the above discussion uses production as the
example parameter, consumption, TMO purchases and TMO sales were also similarly
generated for each sequence. An example of this output is shown as Table 2.3.

2.21              Table 2.3 is separated into three sections.  The top Section is
input data, showing proposed storage construction, projected port turnover,
and expected values of 1982 production, consumption, TMO purchases and sales.
The next Section provides a summary of the storage utilization and deficits
for the thousand fifteen-year sequences. The lower Section shows the expected
values, on a year-by-year basis, of each of the relevant parameters. It is
important to note that these are expected values of the sequences and that in
any given year no two expected values figures are simultaneously valid; e.g.,
in 1987 there is a very small, but positive, value for imports and a large
value for exports. The interpretation of these values is that in any given
year where exports are positive, imports will be zero; however, in a few of
the fifteen-year sequences, a sizeable amount of grain would be imported (in
the 1987 sample, for instance), and in those few sequences, there would be no
export.
2.22              The results of this analysis indicate that, without the Project,
the amount of grain in open storage (thus the amount of resulting losses)
would grow at an extremely rapid rate. The need for additional storage is
made very evident. With the Project, using the baseline estimate of produc-
tion (19.4 million tons by 1985), turnover rates of I to 1.7 for inland silos
(depending on type and location), and port turnover capability of 8, there is
a less than one-percent chance that storage will not be fully utilized and



- 10 -
about a 5% chance that the port facilities will not be used at their maximum
capacity. Additionally, the analysis indicates that:
(a)  even if growth rate is at 2.2% per annum compounded, 1/ there is
still less than one percent chance that storage will not be
fully utilized.
(b)  even with the full proposed Project, the country would have
a strong need for additional storage capacity by the mid-to-
late 1980's.
(c)  unless port turnover ratios exceed those currently projected
(which is doubtful), there would be need for additional port
facilities by the late 1980's.
2.23      Grain Transportation.  Three modes of bulk transportation are used
by TMO for domestic movements of grain: road, rail, and coastal shipping.
With the exception of the Thrace, Ankara, and Adana districts, the major pro-
duction areas tend not to correspond geographically with the heavy consuming
areas, and much of the grain has to be moved several hundred kilometers,
often over difficult terrain. It is important, therefore, that maximum use
be made of the "least cost" mode of transport to the extent that this is
possible.
2.24      One of the most acute problems in the transport sector is the
overall shortage of railway rolling stock to service an expanding economy.
Turkiye Cumhuriyeti Devlet Demir-yollari (TCDD), the Turkish State Railways,
operated only just under 19,000 wagons in 1976 of which a little over 17,000
were available for commercial service at any one time. It is able to meet
only a part of the demands placed upon it. None of these wagons are specifi-
cally designed to carry grains.  The only hopper wagons available are for
borax transport and are owned by the mining companies.
2.25       Concerning TMO's use of rail to transport grain, requests for rail-
way wagons are made locally by the TMO agency concerned, with no advance plan-
ning from TMO headquarters, and appear to cover only the immediate needs and
such capacity as can be loaded within the time allotment--4 hours per wagon--
without incurring demurrage charges. A very important reason for this is
inefficient communication between TMO and its field offices and the resulting
lack of up-to-date information on stocks, among others (para. 4.05). TCDD is
dissatisfied with this system because it results in a large number of station
stops to drop off or pick up wagons for each train, thereby slowing down the
whole system and using equipment inefficiently. TMO finds this also unsatis-
factory because it can get no assurance of when wagons will be supplied, or
in what numbers, or when grain shipments will reach their destination. It is
no wonder, therefore, that TMO has preferred to use trucks for transport, in
spite of their higher cost, for their greater availability and flexibility.
1/   A very conservative rate derived from the series of wheat production
during 1962-1974.



- 11 -
2.26      While TMO's preference for road transport is understandable, it is
to a great extent, also unavoidable since much of the production areas are
not served directly by the rail network. However, it is in the interest of
the Turkish economy as a whole to maximize the use of rail transport for
long-haul, high-volume movements of a homogenous commodity like bulk grain.
The degree of reliance on road transport which currently exists is wasteful
of natural resources: road transport costs are higher than rail costs both
in economic terms (para 5.04) and in terms of foreign exchange requirements
for equipment and fuel. Moreover, highway traffic is becoming increasingly
congested as more grain traffic is moved by roads to ports and urban centers.
Also, the layout and handling capacity of existing terminal silos are not
suited to heavy or exclusive reliance on receipts by truck, while their
capacity for receipt by rail is often underutilized. At a time of high
production levels and an export program that should be handled expeditiously
at least cost, it seems mandatory that greater use be made of the railroad for
long-haul grain transport.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objective and Concept
3.01      The proposed Project would improve TMO's operational capability thus
enabling it to better discharge its official responsibility of marketing
grains domestically and for export. Accordingly, the Project includes the
following components:
(a) A construction program to build 860,000 tons of inland
and 50,000 tons of port storage facilities;
(b) Improvements of some existing port silos;
(c) Improvement in grain transport by the provision of 300
rail hopper wagons;
(d) Improvement in TMO's operations with respect to:
(i) timely processing of key management data;
(ii) communication between the TMO offices; and
(iii) training of silo managers and staff.
3.02      Approximately two-thirds of the inland storage capacity to be
built would be located on the rail network and equipped with rail handling
facilities to improve handling efficiency and cost and, in the case of many,
so that they can backstop port silos as well. Together with minor improve-
ments to some existing port silos, this would permit better storage turnover
at the ports and should allow existing port storage facilities to handle 2 to
2.5 million tons a year, the country's present export target.



- 12 -
3.03       In view of the important linkage between the Government's price
support and input programs affecting grains and the possible effect on land-
use patterns and the future overall grain storage requirements, 1/ the Project
would require study of Turkey's price subsidy program in relation to alternate
land-use strategies (para. 2.02).
3.04      The Bank has financed eight projects in the Turkish agricultural
sector. A common problem in project implementation in all these projects
are related to project start-up. These include delays in providing the
initial local funds required, in setting up the project organization, and
in hiring consultants where necessary. Coordination among project units
(when there are several) and also with and among involved government agencies
have also been initial problems. To help avoid these, the proposed Project
would require an initial increase in the capitalization of TMO (para 3.17)
and the hiring of consultants to make the engineering studies and design of
project silos (para 3.14) as conditions of effectiveness. The Project also
requires that silo sites be acquired prior to tenders to construct Project
silos being issued (para 3.18). To ensure the efficient utilization of the
specialized grain wagons to be financed under the Project, an agreement on
their efficient use would be made between TMO and TCDD, the two Governmment-
owned agencies principally involved in the Project. This agreement would
contain, as a minimum, certain covenants prescribed by the Bank (para 3.10).
B. Detailed Features
Inland Silos
3.05      Thirty-six inland grain silos with a total capacity of 860,000 tons,
representing about 76% of total estimated Project cost (TPC), would be built
in producing and consuming areas. On the basis of a computer analysis of
regional needs, the facilities would be located in eight regions (Map IBRD
14195):
1/   Because of TMO's very large storage requirements as now projected, a
second grain storage project is foreseen.

/a   Type A - 20,000 tons without rail facilities.

The choice of silo capacities under the Project was made on economic grounds
and are discussed in Chapter V. Consequently, an assurance was obtained
during negotiations that unless the Bank otherwise agrees, the silos would be
built according to the types and at locations indicated in Annex 2. Sites for
silos which would be built on locations which at this time are not specified
would be determined in agreement with the Bank not later than October 31,
1980.
3.06      All the storage facilities would be in the form of vertical silos.
They have the following advantages over horizontal warehouses: separating
of grain varieties is convenient and blending can be easily accomplished
to obtain desired grades; fast handling can be done with minimum amount of
machinery due to the advantage of gravity flow; fumigation can be accomplished
in a selective manner; monitoring the condition of the stored grain by means
of permanent temperature sensors is greatly simplified; grain found to be
going out of condition can be localized and, if necessary, can be moved out
and treated; aeration facilities can be permanently incorporated at minimal
cost; by proper machinery selection and location dust problems can be greatly
minimized; and less ground space is required for the same amount of storage
capacity. In terms of overall costs, vertical silos are cheaper to build and
operate than horizontal warehouses with similar functions. The estimated
annual overall cost of vertical silos in the Project (including depreciation,
operating costs, and losses) is about TL 247 per ton compared to TL 438 per
ton in the case of horizontal warehouses of the same capacity. The silos
would be in reinforced concrete; they last at least twice as long as those
of steel and are easier to maintain. During negotiations, an assurance was
obtained on the foregoing.
Port Silos (about 6.4% of TPC)
3.07       Tekirdag.  Grain from the surplus-producing Thrace area is stored
at Tekirdag where it is received from trucks and manually unloaded into



- 14 -
old Nissen-type warehouses. To transfer grain from these warehouses, trucks
are loaded by means of portable pneumatic units, a very inefficient method.
The trucks are then driven to a jetty across the road and the grain loaded on
ships by similar pneumatic equipment. A modern port is being contemplated for
Tekirdag, but it will be several years before it would be even in the planning
and design stage. Tekirdag is important to the Thrace area and there is need
to relieve the existing conditions. An export silo would be built under the
Project which, if the new port goes through, could still be utilized for
loading coasters and barges. The proposed 30,000-ton storage facility will
receive grain through two hydraulic truck dumpers and will load out at 500
tons per hour through an automatic scale and through a belt conveyor which
will transport grain across the road to a gallery above the jetty; discharge
to ships will be through four movable and telescoping spouts. The assumption
was made that the jetty (owned by the Government) would support this hopper
gallery. In all probability, reinforcing work must be done to the jetty;
therefore, an assurance was obtained from Government during negotiations that
it would take steps to ensure that the jetty would be able to support the
gallery contemplated in this Project component before the silo is actually
built.
3.08      Iskenderun.  The present facility at Iskenderun has a capacity of
20,000 tons and is used for loading grain into ships berthed at an adjacent
jetty which is operated by the TCDD. There are many delays in obtaining the
use of the jetty because TCDD has spur tracks that run on the jetty to load
or unload TCDD freight directly into or from vessels tied to the jetty. To
expedite the loading of TMO grain into vessels, additional storage of 20,000
tons would be provided to increase the available stocks (surge capacity) to
load out whenever TMO is allowed use of the jetty. In addition, the present
rail sidings would be revamped and a truck and rail receiving facility pro-
vided (similar to that to be used in the inland silos) to expedite the receiv-
ing of grain. Future port plans for Iskenderun include a new port elevator;
if this comes into being, the proposed facility would then be used for loading
coastal vessels. Also, during some years when Turkey might have to import
wheat and other grains (para 2.21), the expanded capacity in Iskenderun, as
well as that in Takirdag, could be used for import purposes.
Improvements to Existing Port Silos
3.09       Improvements would be made to two existing port silos in order
to increase their handling capacities. At Haydarpasa, truck unloading is
manually done; therefore, two hydraulic truck dumps and a weighbridge would
be provided to facilitate the truck receiving operation. At Izmir, two
hydraulic truck dumps will also be added for the same reason. Cost of
improvements is negligible in relation to TPC.
Rail Hopper Wagons
3.10       It is envisaged that hopper cars would operate, at least initially,
between major surplus production areas and export silos or urban holding
silos. Assuming average turnaround time of 4 days (para 5.04), and assuming
further that the hopper wagons would be operated in block or units, it is
estimated that there is need for around 600 rail hopper wagons to service the



- 15 -
requirements of TMO by 1985. The Project, however, would provide finance
(17% of TPC) for 300 wagons as a first tranche. Each wagon would have a load
capacity of 60 tons and would have top-loading hatches and hopper bottoms for
rapid unloading. The fleet of hopper wagons would be an investment by TCDD,
which would operate and maintain them. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that the hopper wagons would be used exclusively for the transport
of grain; that at least 150 wagons would be put into operation by TCDD not
later than December 31, 1980 or such later date as may be agreed by the
*          Borrower and the Bank and the balance, in the following 12 months.  An assur-
ance was likewise obtained that TCDD and TMO would establish procedures for
the efficient use of the hopper wagons and that this agreement would be
conveyed to the Bank for its information not later than September 30, 1980.
The agreement would contain, among other things, covenants to the effect that
the use of hopper wagons would be subject to the approved TCDD tariff struc-
ture for bulk grain; that the wagons would be used on agreed specific long-
distance routes with the objective of operating them in unit trains to the
maximum extent possible; TMO's transport requests would be confined as far as
possible to a minimum number of loading points per train and for full train
loads to a single destination; and procedures would be established for iden-
tification of each unit and tracing its position at any point in time, in
order to monitor equipment use. Agreement was also obtained that TCDD would
aim to achieve targets of 90% of the hopper wagons in service at any one time
and an average turnaround time of four days.
Improvements to TMO Organization (negligible in terms of TPC)
3.11      Processing of Key Management Data; Communication Between TMO Offices.
To aid in stock management, particularly their movement, there is need to
improve the kind and time availability of key management data. Accordingly,
the Project would finance, during the first year of the Project following the
signing of the Loan, the services of a consultant for approximately three
weeks who would advise on more effective use of TMO's present rented computer
and on the possible justification for acquiring a more versatile one. The
consultant would also look into the form of communication system (e.g., telex
vs. computer) that would be best for the various TMO offices. Once a decision
is made, the Project provides for acquisition of the pertinent equipment
together with consultant services for about six weeks to set up the system
and another two weeks for the training of TMO personnel. An assurance was
obtained that the consultants would be employed under terms of reference
(Annex 3) agreed with the Bank.
3.12      Training Program.  The new silos would be relatively more mechanized
than present facilities: silo operation would require new binning procedures
and turning and blending of grades and there would be additional attention
to quality control, grading, and conditioning of grain with respect to stocks
for export. A training program would, therefore, be necessary to prepare
managers and supporting staff for the operation of the silos to be built under
the Project. The training program would be in two stages. Firstly, the
Director of TMO's Training Department and/or his Deputy would be given
external training on global grain marketing during the first year of the



- 16 -
Project following signing of the Loan (such a course is given, for instance,
by the Canadian International Grain Institute and includes such subjects as
quality analysis and control, grain transport, grain processing procedures and
equipment, etc.). Following this training, the Training Department would draw
up and supervise a 3-month course of study for potential silo managers and
senior supporting staff. Candidates would be selected under uniform guide-
lines at least 6 months before the first Project silos are scheduled to become
operational. Lecturers for the course would be largely drawn from TMO staff,
but could include international consultants on specific aspects of the course.
The training program would be prepared by TMO and agreed with the Bank.  An
assurance to this effect was obtained during negotiations. Terms of reference
for the Training Programs are in Annex 4.
Study
3.13      An evaluation of Turkey's agricultural land use strategy, commodity
price support and subsidy programs would be made under the responsibility of
the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock (MA). The study would be
carried out by the recently created unit in MA with the assistance of inter-
nationally recruited consultants. It would be based on terms of reference
agreed with the Bank (Annex 5) and would begin on or before January 31, 1980,
or such later date as may be agreed with the Bank, and would be completed not
later than November 30, 1980. The report and recommendations of the study
would be provided to the Bank for its comments. The results of the study are
expected to lead to recommendations on how to make existing policies more
effective in terms of basic national economic and agricultural sector objec-
tives and, in particular, how to encourage optimal use of agricultural land
resources, to orient the commodity price and input subsidy program towards
production objectives, and to indicate the budgetary implications of the pro-
ducer support price and subsidy programs together with the related consumer
subsidy programs. Accordingly, not later than September 30, 1981, Government
would prepare and initiate implementation of a plan to carry out and encourage
improvements in agricultural land use, price support and subsidy programs,
after considering the Bank's comments on the report and recommendations.
C. Status of Design
3.14      The construction components of the Project (construction of inland
and port silos and improvements to existing port silos) was appraised on
the basis of preliminary drawings by a Bank consultant.  Engineering study
and detailed designs with variations (particularly on foundations and silo
heights) to suit chosen silo locations, assistance with preparation of bid
documents, evaluation of bids and preparation of contracts, as well as super-
vision of actual construction would be made by consultants (about 400 man-
months at an average cost of $10,000 per month over four and a half years)
employed under terms of reference (Annex 6) agreed with the Bank. The employ-
ment of such consultants would be made not later than November 1, 1979. On
the other hand, design of the 60-ton capacity rail hopper wagons would follow



-17 -
basically those now used for hauling borax in Turkey or one accepted inter-
nationally as a standard for grain transport. However, the choice of design
would be made by TCDD in agreement with TMO and would be satisfactory to the
Bank. An assurance was obtained during negotiations to this effect.
D. Implementation Schedule
3.15      It is expected that the construction of inland and port silos and
improvements to existing port silos would take about four and a half years to
complete: engineering study and design and the contract award process would
take about 15 months and the subsequent actual constructions would take about
three years. While constructing a silo and its commissioning period would
each take about 15 months, winning contractors are expected to phase their
construction program to make efficient use of labor and equipment. The
construction of the 300 hopper wagons would be completed by December 31, 1981.
Improvements to the TMO organization and the training of the Director of TMO's
Training Department and/or his Deputy would be completed not later than the
end of the first year of the Project following Loan signing. Overall, the
Project should be completed in five years. An implementation schedule is in
Annex 7, Chart IBRD No. 19744.
E. Cost Estimates
3.16      The estimated total cost of the Project is TL 5,156 million
(US$206.1 million equivalent), of which about TL 2,126.0 million (US$85.0
million), or 41%, would be the estimated foreign exchange requirement.
Details of Project costs are given in Annex 8 and are summarized hereunder:

The total estimated Project cost is in terms of October 1978 prices, exclusive
of taxes and duties and includes: (a) provisions for physical contingency
equal to 10% of the estimated base cost; and (b) price contingency applied at
compounded annual rates as follows: local - 40% for the first year, 30% for
the second, 20% for the third, and 10% yearly thereafter; foreign exchange
component - 7%.  Devaluation of the Turkish lira would result in increasing
the local currency cost of the Project as well as total Project cost in terms
of Turkish lira; devaluation would also change project costs in terms of US
dollar equivalents.
F. Financing
3.17               The Project would be financed as follows:

March, 1979
The proposed Bank loan of US$85 million equivalent, with the Government as
Borrower, would finance the entire estimated foreign exchange cost of the
Project. Turkish lira funds needed by TMO would be met by increasing TMO's
present paid-in capital of TL 600 million to its authorized capital of TL
1,400 million:   TL 100 million would be paid-in as a condition of effective-
ness, and the remainder, TL 700 million, no later than December 31, 1980, or
such later date as may be subsequently agreed by the Bank. The balance of
funds required by TMO under the Project would be in the form of loans by
Government in amounts as may be needed. In the case of TCDD, funds would,
likewise, be provided by the Government in the form of a loan. The loans to
TMO and TCDD [both from the Bank loan (the Government would bear the foreign
exchange risk) and the Government's own resources] would be at an interest
rate no less than the rate charged for the proposed Bank loan. Assurances on
the foregoing were obtained during negotiations.



- 20 -
G. Procurement
3.18      During negotiations, an assurance was obtained that contracts for
the construction of inland silos (US$147 million) and port silos (US$12.3
million) as well as for improvements to existing port silos (0.7 million)
would be awarded after tendering through international competitive bidding
(ICB) on a single contract basis, exclusive of engineering study and design.
The inland silo contracts would be tendered in groups of silos by regions
or parts of regions and bidders would be able to bid for one or more groups
thereby attracting greater competition. Each group of inland silos would
contain at least three silos except for the Izmir and Afyon regions which
have allocations under the Project of one and two silos, respectively. Pre-
qualifications of bidders would be required to ensure that bidders have the
necessary experience and technical resource capacity to carry out the work.
An assurance was also obtained that TMO would not invite bids for the con-
struction of inland and port silos unless it has a clear ownership title or
a valid lease of not less than 50 years on the land on which a silo is to be
built.
3.19      In the case of rail hopper wagons, construction would be undertaken
by TCDD in their workshops. Turkish law prohibits the purchase of finished
wagons and consequently, wagons are reserved for domestic procurement (para
4.10). However, in order to construct railway wagons, TCDD has to import
certain parts (brake pneumatic equipment, wheel sets, drawbar and buffer
equipment, and axle bearings) which are not manufactured in Turkey. The
direct foreign exchange cost of these parts for 300 rail hopper wagons is
about $3.0 million including contingencies (about 9% of the total wagon cost
of $35 million) and the proposed Bank Loan would finance these imported parts.
An additional $4.0 million in indirect foreign exchange costs is excluded from
the Loan and would be financed by TCDD as part of the $32 million equivalent
it would contribute. The imported parts would be bulked as much as possible
and procurement would be by ICB; an assurance to this effect was obtained
during negotiations. The rail hopper wagons, under the proposed unit train
operating procedure are expected to have the highest separate ERR (39%) of any
Project components. They are essential to achieving the expected turnover of
eight at the port silos (thereby avoiding at this time the need for further
expansion of port silo capacities), achieving the expected turnover of up to
1.7 in inland silos, and reducing heavy reliance on road transport of grains.
In view of Turkey's present dire foreign exchange difficulties and taking
account of the major contribution of the hopper wagons to the ERR, achieving
improvements in grain handling, turnover of silos and reduction in trans-
portation costs, the financing of the direct foreign exchange costs of parts
has been included in the Loan.
3.20      Prudent shopping would be observed for the procurement of computer
and communications systems for TMO, costing about $170,000, on the basis of
the consultant's report which will describe the specific requirements and
general characteristics of the equipment required to improve TMO's data
communications systems. During negotiations, an assurance was obtained on the
foregoing.

H. Disbursements
3.21      The Bank would disburse on account of the various Project components
as follows:
Project Components                      Percentages of Expenditure to be Financed
Design and engineering                  100% of foreign expenditure disbursements
Inland silos                            50% of total expenditures
Port silos                              50% of total expenditures
Improvements to port silos              70% of total expenditures

IV. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Toprak Mahsulleri Ofisi
Project Implementation
4.01       Cost-wise, TMO would be responsible for implementing about 83% of
the Project. TMO departments (Annex 10) which would be intensively involved in
Project implementation are: Research, Planning, and Coordination; Purchase
and Storage; Sales; Transport; Central Accounts; Office of the Legal Advisor;
and Training. There would generally be an intermingling of tasks among the
Departments. For instance, engineering study and design would be the main
responsibility of the Engineering Department with the Purchase and Storage,
Sales, and Research, Planning, and Coordination Departments deciding on
silo sites and determining particular silo features. Preparation of bid
requests and contract awards would be by the Engineering Department (assisted
by consultants (para 3.14); and the Office of the Legal Advisor. Together,
the Purchasing and Storage, Sales, and Transport Departments would discuss
with TCDD guiding arrangements for the efficient utilization (para. 3.10) of
hopper wagons provided under the Project. Finally, the Central Accounts
Department would be in the center of efforts to improve TMO's communications
system and data processing, while the Training Department would be responsible
for the training of silo managers and operational staff; in all these, they
would be assisted by the Research, Planning and Coordination Department.

4.02      As mentioned earlier (paras 2.11 and 2.12), TMO's principal function
is to act as a residual buyer of cereals at prices set by Government and to
supply these to approved consumers, also at official prices. Such being
the case, THO's past performance cannot be judged on the basis of financial
results; nevertheless, it can be pointed out that TMO's cost of handling wheat
have dropped from TL 0.39 (US cents 1.6) per ton in 1975 to TL 0.32 (US cents
1.3) per ton in 1977 (cost decrease of 18%). Also, despite the suddenness of
wheat surpluses during the past four years, TMO has effectively arranged and
operated temporary storage and handling in the face of considerable difficul-
ties, thus avoiding losses which could have been very excessive. TMO is a
well-managed, well-organized institution. Officers in key positions, as well
as technical staff are experienced university graduates which have been with
TMO for some time. It has a highly-motivated staff. Also noteworthy is the
fact that TMO has an in-house review unit (para 4.06) directly responsible to
TMO's General Director which scrutinizes and evaluates TMO operations, parti-
cularly stock accountability (TMO regulations, for instance, require that all
quantity losses of more than 1% must be investigated and explained) and, in
general, acts as the eyes and ears of management.
4.03      In view of the relatively large construction program envisaged
under the Project, to hasten Project implementation and afford valuable
training to TMO personnel, consultants would be employed to assist in
engineering study and design, in the preparation of the technical aspects
of bid requests and contract awards, and in the supervision of silo con-
struction (para 3.14). Consultants would also advise in the improvement
of TMO's data processing and communications system (para 3.11).
Accounting
4.04      The accounting principles and basic procedures used by TMO are
those laid down for all Turkish State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) and conform
closely to international accounting standards. The great majority of the
entries processed through TMO's accounting system come from the field agen-
cies. Uniform recording procedures are followed by even the smallest tem-
porary agency. Accounting documents are forwarded directly to TMO, Ankara,
at least every ten days, and generally daily during the harvest. Delays
in dispatch from agencies may occur if their location is remote from post
collection points, or if they are too busy during the harvest to summarize
and dispatch, or if in the winter climatic conditions so prevent.
4.05      At Ankara, the coding of the documents from the field is checked
by the Central Accounting Department and they are passed on to the Card-
punching Unit of the Computer Center. Three or four weeks after month-end,
all cards are ready for computer processing.  Under the circumstances, delays
of as much as five months in producing accounting and management data occur.
The Project would provide for improving this situation (para. 3.11) since
undoubtedly, up-to-date data (especially in the matter of stock control) is
necessary for TMO management to operate efficiently and expeditiously.



- 23 -
Auditing
4.06      Internal Audit.  Internal audit of TMO's operation is carried
out by the TMO Inspection Board, established under Law No. 440, Article 2.
The Board is responsible directly to the Director General. At the end of
October 1978, the Board had 53 staff, all classified as managerial. It
conducts routine inspections of field units, prepares reports on the general
situation of the regional offices, and makes special investigations at the
behest of the Director General. The Inspection Board is a positive force as
it makes proposals, on the basis of its investigations, for improvements in
TMO operations.
4.07      External Audit.  The independent audit of TMO, as of the other
SEEs in Turkey, is conducted by the Supreme Auditing Board (SAB), which is
attached to the Prime Minister's Department. Four of the Board's staff are
permanently stationed with TMO. They visit at least the most important
Regional Offices annually.
4.08      Auditing of TMO's accounts and operations is satisfactory.  During
negotiations, assurance was obtained that TMO's operations and accounts would
be examined by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Audit reports
certified by the independent auditors must be furnished to the Bank not later
than seven months after the end of TMO's fiscal year.
Monitoring
4.09      In order to have a reliable measure of the benefits derived from
the new silos to be constructed and improvements to be made on existing port
silos under the Project, which data, for one thing, would be very important
in assessing a possible second storage project (para. 3.03), TMO would keep
detailed records of grain receipts and deliveries from these silos as well
as details of costs of operating them. On the basis of the resulting informa-
tion and those supplied by TCDD, TMO will prepare: (a) semi-annual progress
reports to be submitted within three months of the completion of each semester;
(b) an annual report on each crop year within six months of the end of the
crop year; and (c) a Project completion report not later than six months after
the closing date of the Project.  The format for these reports would be agreed
with TMO during negotiations. An assurance was obtained to this effect during
negotiations.
B. Turkiye Cumhuriyeti Devlet Demir-yollari
4.10      In 1973, the Bank financed a first-phase of a multi-year rehabili-
tation and modernization of TCDD facilities. TCDD has generally been able
to overcome physical problems encountered and implementation has improved.
Under the Project, TCDD would construct, in their own workshops, 300 grain
rail hopper wagons, costing about $35 million (17% of total Project cost) and
subsequently operate them exclusively for the transport of grain. Beginning



- 24 -
with the Second Five-Year Development Plan (1968-1972), the importation of
railway rolling stock, which could be manufactured in Turkey, was prohibited
by law. Accordingly, TCDD would build the wagons in any of their four work-
shops located in Eskisehir, Sivas, Adapazari, and Ankara, which have a com-
bined building capacity of 1,500 wagons per year. The workshops are separate
entities within TCDD and are accountable directly to the TCDD Board. The
shops are efficient and have produced rolling stock of satisfactory quality
(over 1,000 wagons in 1977). Materials used in the manufacture of rolling
stocks are produced locally save for specialized components (brake pneumatic
equipment, wheel sets, drawbar and buffer equipment and axle bearings) which
have to be imported. The estimated base cost of these grain hopper wagons,
manufactured by TCDD, is $68,000 each, at the exchange rate of US$1 = TL 25.
If the Turkish lira is devalued to say TL 30 = US$1, the cost of the Turkish
wagons are likely to fall to about $62,000 each (labor cost is about 55% of
the total). It has proved difficult to obtain comparative costs. Similar
wagons can be purchased currently on the eastern seaboard of the United States
for about $38,000 ex-factory; however, freight costs to Turkey from the
eastern seaboard, at this point in time, is estimated to be $45,000 per wagon.
Grain wagons from India are estimated to cost about $45,000 ex factory and
freight to Turkey is estimated at about $20,000. Also grain wagons can be
purchased currently in France and Germany at a cost of about $52,000 plus
transportation by rail to Turkey of about $2,000 per wagon. It would thus
appear that grain hopper wagons can be manufactured by TCDD in their workshops
at prices similar to imported wagons from USA and India and can be imported
at a lower cost (20%) from France and Germany. The manufacture of 300 grain
hopper wagons, over two years, should not offer TCDD any physical problems
provided the direct foreign exchange needed to import the specialized com-
ponents is made available through the Project (para 3.19).
C. The Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock
4.11      The Study component under the Project would be implemented by the
General Directorate of Planning, Research, and Coordination of the Ministry
of Food, Agriculture and Livestock (MA). This is in line with the recom-
mendation of the ASSR that principal responsibility for agricultural sector
analysis and for the formulation of sector policies should be given to
the MA. As stated in para. 3.13, the General Directorate would employ con-
sultants under terms of reference agreed with the Bank to assist in carrying
out the studies.
V. PROJECT BENEFITS
A. Direct Benefits
5.01       Important benefits that would accrue from the Project include:
reduction of the amount of grain in open storage and, hence, the resulting
losses therefrom; reduced cost of grain handling and transportation; and
increased export capability.



- 25 -
Reduced Losses from Open Storage
5.02      The CP mission estimated that in a full year, annual losses from
open storage can range from 3% to 5% in the plateau regions to 6% to 9% in
the coastal areas. Conservative figures have been used in the economic
analysis to estimate losses from open storage; the following figures are
probably in the lower range of actual losses:
Table 5.1: AVERAGE LOSS ASSUMPTIONS ON A
COUNTRYWIDE BASIS ACCORDING TO DURATION OF OPEN STORAGE
%          TL/ton
Six months or less                   3.0             113
1st full year                        4.5             170
1 1/2 years                          5.6             213
2 years                              6.7             255
2 1/2 years                           7.4            284
3 years                              8.9             340
The use of open storage would be substantially less with the Project and
major benefits would include savings in operating costs and reduced storage
losses (physical and quality). Without the Project, the simulation model
shows that, under the base case (para 2.22), average stocks in open storage
would increase progressively to a level of six million tons in 1985 and as
much as 14 million tons ten years later. Even with the Project, there would
still need to be considerable reliance on open storage; average annual stocks
in the simulation model for the base case lie between two to three million
tons at the end of the simulation period. In the with-Project case, the bulk
of grain in open storage would be shipped out in less than a year and storage
for more than 1-1/2 years would be unnecessary. In the without-Project case,
all grain would be stored for one year or longer after 1986 and during the
1990's much of the grain would need to be stored for two years or longer.
Taking into account the above assumptions and the varying duration of storage
in the open, the net difference in the total annual value of losses occurring
with and without the Project is estimated to reach around TL 440 million in
the mid 1980's and over TL 1,020 million in the 1990's.
Reduced Handling and Transport Costs (Inland)
5.03      The introduction of hopper wagons with direct top-loading and bottom
discharge would eliminate the need to employ contract labor in loading and
unloading operations, and such costs of handling as there are effectively
incorporated in the silo operating costs. At present, even where direct
loading facilities are available at vertical silos, the use of box cars and
the practice of "bagging" the open sides to minimize spillage in transit
results in a slow and cumbersome operation incurring high labor costs.



- 26 -
5.04      The provision of hopper wagons and the construction of new inland
storage (two-thirds of which would be equipped with rail-loading facilities)
would together, also allow substantial transport cost savings. Grain which
would otherwise have to be moved by road would be transported by cheaper
rail; there would also be a reduction in rail costs by operating the hopper
wagons as a unit or block. Under unit train operation, it should be feasible
to improve turn-around time by a factor of 2 through a reduction of "hot-
watching" time and of shunting and marshalling operations and an additional
factor of 0.5 by improvement in average train speed of 25% (to 25 km/hour).
Assuming that 90% of the 300 cars are in service at any one time, the follow-
ing annual capacity would be available:
Table 5.2: RANGE OF HOPPER WAGON PERFORMANCE
Good    Moderate    Poor
Average turnaround time (days)                  3        4           5
No. of trips/wagon/year                      120        90          70
Total fleet capacity/year (million tons)    1.9          1.5          1.1
Costs have been based on a moderate level of operating efficiency, or an
annual capacity of about 1.5 million tons; however, this could fall below
a million tons if average performance fell short of expectations. At the
worst, if wagons were not employed in unit trains at all and average turn-
around time achieved were no better than the system average (8.5 days), the
fleet capacity would fall to about 700,000 tons a year; TMO would still
benefit from improved availability of wagons reserved for grain and there
would still be cost savings in relation to road transport. In the analysis,
the economic cost of wagons operated in units at average turnaround time of 4
days is estimated at TL 0.46 per ton/km against TL 0.72 and TL 1.20 for box
cars and road transport, respectively. It was also assumed that 40% of TMO
grain movement would be moved by rail beginning with the fourth year of
the Project. This was a rate already achieved in 1975 but which fell to
31% in 1977 because of the conditions described in para 2.25.
Increase in Export Capability
5.05      The capacity of Turkey to export grain is at present constrained
by several factors: limited and irregular availability of transport to the
ports; constraints on access to inland stocks in open storage during much of
the year; inadequate reception/outloading facilities at some port silos; and
inadequate silo capacity and/or low silo utilization at the main ports.
5.06      Without the Project, it is expected that the annual export capability
would remain below the average annual exportable surplus and, in consequence,
valuable foreign exchange earnings could be deferred or lost. The following
separate Project components would together raise export capacity to match
average annual exportable surpluses and improve the quality of exportable
grain:



- 27 -
(a) improved reliability and availability of transport with
the introduction of hopper wagons and unit trains for
grain;
(b) improved access to inland storage sites with the replace-
ment of some open storage by silos with rapid outloading
facilities;
(c) minor port silo improvements at Izmir and Haydarpasa,
allowing faster reception;
(d) expanded port silo capacity at Tekirdag and Iskenderun;
and
(e) improved inventory control system.
The chief benefits to be derived from these improvements would include the
following: gains in foreign exchange earnings and reduced port handling
costs.
5.07      Gains in Foreign Exchange Earnings.  Following the port silo
turnover assumption of 8 (para 5.09) adopted for the base case, the maximum
annual export capacity with the Project would be 2.5 million tons, compared
with 1.64 million tons without the Project. The simulation model results
suggest that average annual exports over the fifteen year period would be 0.73
million tons higher with the full Project than without it. In US dollar
terms, this means about 14 million annually.
5.08      Reduction in Port Handling Costs.  Provision of automated truck-
receiving facilities at Haydarpasa and Izmir should allow a reduction in truck
unloading costs compared with the manual system now operating. At Tekirdag,
use is made of trucks, screw conveyors and pneumatic conveyors in loading from
the existing flat storage to export (and coastal) vessels. The automated
handling incorporated in the new silo would avoid double handling of grain.
B. Results of Economic Analysis
Global Analysis
5.09      During 1977 to 1979, average turnover of silos at the ports of
Iskenderun, Mersin, Izmir, Haydarpasa, and Tekirdag, with a combined capacity
of 238,000 tons, was 5.5. With the increasing experience of TMO in the export
market, even without the Project, port silo turnover should easily reach an
average of 6. Because of improvements under the Project, port silo turnover
is conservatively expected to rise to 8 (this is not a high standard for a
modern export silo; recent performance has been below this level largely
because of transport and delivery problems and inadequacies in the receiving
facilities); on this assumption, the internal economic rate of return is
estimated at 21%.

5.10       Switching values were calculated to determine how individual bene-
fits and cost streams would have to differ from base projections to drive the
Project's net present value to zero. The analysis shows the largest change
in invididual items which the Project can absorb (with all other benefits
and cost projections constant) and still remain viable are:

(iv)  Transportation costs               3,825            13,653         +255
The analysis also shows that total costs would have to increase by 70%, or
total benefits would have to decrease by 40% for the Project not to be
economically viable.
5.11      Other sensitivity exercises that were performed on the base case
resulted in the following rates of return:
(a)  One year lag in benefit stream                     19%
(c) Inclusion of 1% quality-related price
increase in grain handled by Project silos    22%
5.12       Turkey is currently experiencing a rate of inflation well in excess
of that of major world currencies. Although the rate is expected to moderate
(para. 3.16), a significant divergence may persist for some time. The country
is also facing an acute balance of payments situation and persistent pressure
on reserves. Further devaluation of the Turkish lira in the short term is a
possibility which needs to be taken into account.  The Project was subjected
to a sensitivity test based on a 20% devaluation against the U.S. dollar (US$
= TL 30), but otherwise holding all costs and benefits at constant 1978 price
levels. The result would be to increase investment costs by about 8%, and the
benefit stream by about twice that level: the net effect would be to raise
the Project rate of return by about 1%.



- 29 -
5.13      The sensitivity analysis (para 5.10 and 5.11) indicate that it would
take a major shortfall in base assumptions to arrive at unsatisfactory rates
of return on investments. The risk of underutilization of Project storage
capacity appears small (para. 2.22): a deliberately cautious approach has
been adopted in respect of port storage on the thesis that existing capacity
should be adequate to handle projected exports if turnover could be raised to
a plausibly moderate level; other components of the Project are designed to
ensure that this can be achieved. Even in the unlikely event that Turkey
failed to maintain any export capability, the risk of underutilization of
Project inland storage would be low: total inland capacity with the Project
(assuming elimination of obsolete storage) would still be only 2.5 million
tons. The majority of the silos are designated for areas with large net
production surpluses which would continue to require storage and redistribu-
tion to deficit regions even if there were no net national exportable surplus.
Other key silos are designed to provide holding storage to meet demand in
large urban centers nearby. Again, should Government agricultural policy be
deliberately switched away from wheat production for food towards a greater
concentration on livestock, there would then be a compensating storage
requirement for feedgrains.
Analysis of Individual Project Components
5.14      The question of attribution of benefits to different Project com-
ponents is an academic one, for in practice individual components implemented
in isolation would have limited impact without the interaction of other
parts of the Project. The Project should properly be viewed as an integrated
improvement of the whole Turkish grain storage and distribution system.
However, it is clearly of interest to gain a broad indication of the relative
importance of the individual components. An attempt was made accordingly to
allocate benefits. The resulting conclusions are as follows:
(a) clearly, the port silo expansion component has a significant
effect on physical export capacity. However, this should
not be taken as a general prescription for increasing port
storage capacity. Existing ones should be sufficient to
handle projected exports if an annual turnover of about
10 could be achieved, the Project expects turnover to rise
to 8;
(b) the minor improvements at Izmir and Haydarpasa represent a
small investment with large potential returns;
(c) the analysis gave a return of 39% to the transport com-
ponent, making it probably the most crucial element of the
Project. This is emphasized by the fact that if transport
component is removed from the Project, the ERR falls from
21% to 14%;
(d) the inland storage component gives the following ERRs 1/:
1/   During this exercise, silos of 10,000 and 30,000 ton capacities, which
would be almost as expensive to build as those respectively of 20,000
and 40,000 ton capacities were found to be economically not feasible.

C. Employment Impact
5.15      It is estimated that Project construction would provide over 3,100
man-years of unskilled employment distributed over about four years. However,
once in operation it is expected that the Project would have a slight negative
impact on unskilled employment since it is designed to substitute more effi-
cient, automated storage and handling operations for the present more labor-
intensive system of open storage which relies to a large degree on manual
handling. During the first ten years of the Project, the net decrease in
annual unskilled labor requirements (as against without the Project) is esti-
mated at 1,800 man-years equivalent; however, since much of the labor employed
on contract in open storage and handling operations is part-time, at least
twice this number of men could be affected. There would, in contrast, be a
small net increase in skilled labor requirements for silo operation, estimated
at 150-200 man-years.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      Agreement having been reached on the various issues referred to in
Chapters III and IV of this report, and subject to the condition of effective-
ness in para 3.17, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$85 million
equivalent to the Government of Turkey, for a term of 17 years with 4 years
grace.

GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Wheat Production, Consumption, Exports,
Price Support Policies and Land-Use Strategy
Past Wheat Production, Consumption, and Exports
1.        Wheat is Turkey's main staple food crop and constitutes about two-
thirds of all cereal production. It has long been Government policy to
encourage wheat production towards self-sufficiency and ensure supplies to
domestic consumers at stable prices. From the late 40's to the late 50's,
wheat production increased erratically, but at more than 5% per year on
average, in response to rapidly expanded plantings (mainly in rainfed areas),
despite low and fluctuating productivity that averaged under 1,000 kg/ha.
From the late 50's to the early 70's, productivity became more stable and
increased gradually, but the average rate of growth of output cropped to
about 2% because of much slower expansion of wheat acreage. In the 1970's,
growth of production has accelerated again, to over 5% per year, largely
because of increased productivity, which has reached an average of over 1,400
kg/ha. This is attributable to much higher levels of inputs and four consecu-
tive years of favorable weather beginning in 1975. Wheat acreage has con-
tinued to expand at about 1% per year. This pattern has resulted in output
levels, since 1975, that for the first time have on a sustained basis exceeded
average domestic demand, currently estimated at about 13 million tons. Thus
in 1975-78, output averaged well over 15 million tons and enabled Turkey to
export wheat for the first time. Such exports reached 1.5 million tons in the
1977-78 crop year. The Bank estimates that by 1985, annual production would
reach the 19 million ton level. This estimate is corraborated by estimates
prepared by the Wheat Research and Training Program, an internationally-
assisted organization under the Ministry of Agriculture (Table).
2.        The continuing rise in production has been encouraged by the Govern-
ment's wheat support price program as well as by subsidies on input prices and
credit. These encouragements have enabled large numbers of farmers to use
improved seeds, fertilizers and farm chemicals and to increase the area in
wheat through mechanization. The Government's SEE for grain marketing, the
Soils Products Office (Toprak Mahsulleri Ofisi--TMO) has had insufficient
permanent storage capacity to cope with the resulting surpluses. Large
amounts of wheat have had to be stored in the open with only a covering
of polyethelene and straw. At the end of 1977, for instance, some 5 million
tons of grain were left in the open, with consequent substantial losses.
In addition, the wheat price support program has led to considerable losses
for TMO. Buying prices set high enough to encourage production have often
been substantially higher than international prices, thereby impeding exports.
Selling prices have been fixed low (about 10% below buying prices) to "protect"
consumers.



- 32 -                            ANNEX 1
3.        Against this background, the Government requested a UNDP-financed
FAO study of the price support program, which was completed last year. The
study concluded that, while the price support program had increased the level
and stability of producers' incomes and encouraged increased production,
certain undesirable features were also contributing to the problems noted in
paragraph 2 and to the already strong inflationary pressure in the economy.
For example, the study found that support prices were determined mainly by
adding a fixed percentage to the costs of production of each commodity, with
little attention paid to the market prospects or the relative price levels
between commodities; the sharp rise in wheat productivity in recent years has
not been properly reflected in the calculated cost per ton; and support prices
have usually been announced so late in the production year that they have only
affected the subsequent year's plantings and inputs. As a result, support
prices have tended to be increased for those commodities (such as wheat) that
are benefitting from high input costs, with the higher prices giving still
further encouragement to a compounded increase in use of inputs. The sub-
sidized inputs themselves have thereby not been adequately directed towards
the production of crops with high priority comparative (or export) advantage.
4.        The FAO study recommends a number of specific reforms including
an annual late-summer Government review to define production targets for the
coming year for all major agricultural products (including livestock), estab-
lish corresponding input and credit needs, and determine a balanced set of
support prices to achieve production targets and implement the Government's
farm incomes policy. In line with this, a unit has recently been established
in the Ministry of Agriculture to undertake production planning studies and
make price policy recommendations in the framework of an agricultural land-use
strategy.
Place of Wheat in Land-Use Patterns
5.        The Bank's Agricultural Sector Survey for Turkey (Report No. 1684-TU)
points out that over the past 50 years, Turkey's total crop area has more than
tripled, but that now the possibilities for expansion are becoming exhausted.
The more recent additions have been largely former grazing lands of much lower
productivity, which has led to extensive plowing of steel hillsides, much of
it for wheat, severe over-grazing of the remaining grazing lands and destruc-
tion of vegetation on large tracts of previously forested land. A study
completed in 1974 by TOPRAKSU (the General Directorate of Land and Water
Resources of the Ministry of Village Affairs) estimated that more than 17
million ha of the total land area of 78 million ha are used inappropriately,
most seriously in rainfed areas. Incentives have led to wheat being planted
on lands better suited for barley; barley in turn has been pushed onto land
best left in pasture. An estimated 54% of the total land area is subject to
severe erosion, of which 17% is classified as very severe. Aside from erosion
control in the forest regions, afforestation and irrigation, little is being
done to correct the misuse of land or to arrest the trend of accelerating
erosion.



- 33 -                              ANNEX 1
6.         A major effect of land misuse is the loss of potential production
and income, the latter affecting particularly the lower-income farmers.
The most serious long-term effects are evident in livestock productivity.
Increases in feed resources from wheat stubble and fallow have been more
than offset by the long-term decline in available grazing land (down 2.3%
per year since the mid-fifties) and by increased numbers of animals. As
a result, from 1963 to 1975 the average adult cattle carcass weight declined
from 90 kg to 78 kg and the proportion of immature cattle slaughtered in-
creased sharply.
7.         The TOPRAKSU study concluded that about 12.4 million has should be
shifted from rainfed cropping and 2.5 million ha from grazing and pasture.
With such shifts during the next decade, an annual rate of growth of 5%
in forage production is believed feasible, which, if properly managed
as encouraged under Bank-financed livestock projects, could yield an average
growth rate of red meat production of more than 5% per year. It is estimated
that by the withdrawal of marginal wheat land, the area in wheat production
could be reduced by about 1.4 million, from the 1976 level of 9.2 million ha
to the 1962-64 average of about 7.8 million. This would still be sufficient
acreage through 1987 to meet projected domestic demand in average crop years
by wider use of irrigated land or wider diffusion of improved production
practices in rainfed areas.
8.         As detailed as the TOPRAKSU studies were, however, more analysis
is needed. Some of the land-use recommendations should be reexamined--for
example, the targets for land to be irrigated. There is need for study of
viable alternatives to the present cropping patterns and farming practices
of subsistence farmers and for more information on the costs of present
policies in terms of lost future production. There is also need for an
evaluation of the effect of Turkey's input subsidy and price support programs
on land-use patterns and strategy, as well as an assessment of the related
consumer subsidy program. The Project provides for such a study, based on
agreed terms of reference and to be undertaken by the Agriculture Ministry
through internationally recruited consultants. After completion of the study
and after considering the Bank's comments on the report and recommendations,
the Government would initiate an action plan to carry out and encourage
improvements in the use of agricultural lands and in price support and input
subsidy programs including the related consumer subsidy program.

yield increases annually by about 3%,
the annual production by 1986 will be:

C. Second Case
Assuming: (a) a reduction in area planted to wheat by 1.0 million ha,
(b) a yield of 3.3 t/ha (essentially irrigated or in better
rainfall areas) on 20% or 1.65 million ha, and
(c) a yield of 2.2 t/ha on 80% or 6.6 million ha by 1986,
1.65 million ha x 3.3 t/ha = 5.445 million tons
6.60 million ha x 2.2 t/ha = 14.520 million tons
8.25 million ha                19.965 million tons
/1 The above assumptions are based on investigations, research and development
carried out by the Wheat Development and Training Program assisted by the
Rockefeller Foundation, USAID, and other institutions. It was on these
assumptions that Government established the policy, expressed by SPO, that
Turkey would plan to reduce its wheat acreage by about 1.0 million ha,
remain self-sufficient in wheat production, and produce an average annual
surplus of 2.5 to 3.0 million tons of wheat.

Proposed Terms of Reference -
Training Program for Silo Managers and Supporting Staff
A. Objective
1.        The storage facilities provided under the Project would have a
greater degree of mechanization; silo operation would be more sophisticated,
with new binning procedures, turning, and blending of grain required; while
additional attention would be needed to quality control, grading and condition-
ing of grain for export. Consequently, a training program designed to meet
these requirements is necessary. Such a training program, consisting of two
phases, would be started not later than the spring of 1980.
B. Training Program - First Phase
2.        The Director of the Training Department, TMO, and/or his Deputy would
undergo training in global grain marketing: quality analysis and control,
grain marketing systems, grain transfer, international grain finance, ocean
chartering, grain processing procedures and equipment, principles of milling,
baking, and feed compounding 1/.  This would provide a broad knowledge of the
grain industry as a whole and give expcsure to training techniques and course
preparation. An adequate knowledge of the language of instruction would be
required.
C. Training Program - Second Phase
3.        Following the first phase of training, the Training Department would
be responsible for drawing up, and supervising a course of study for potential
silo managers and senior supporting staff in the following areas of operation:
(a) Variety identification and grading procedures;
(b) Grain weighing; construction, maintenance and calibration of scales;
(c) Silo equipment function and operation;
(d) Infestation detection and control;
l/ Such a course, for 6 weeks, is given, for example, by the Canadian Inter-
national Grain Institute.



- 40 -                          ANNEX 4
(e) Sampling procedures and quality control - familiarization with basic
analysis and implications for quality;
(f) Crop forecasting;
(g) Familiarization with TMO authority, objectives and operations;
(h) Orientation lectures in grain marketing, sales invoicing, role of
the private sector;
(i) Personnel management, labor legislation as appropriate; and
(j) Accounting procedures and familiarization with report preparation
and all reporting forms.
The course of study would be drawn up in agreement with the Bank.
4.        Lecturers for the course would largely be drawn from TMO staff, but
could include international consultants on specific technical aspects of the
course.
5.        The selection of candidates for the training course should be com-
pleted at least 6 months before the first Project silos become operational,
to allow time for completion of the course, followed by complete familiarization
with the unit to which each manager would be assigned before operations actually
commence. Selection of trainees would be the responsibility of TMO management
but minimum educational standards would be established, and some prior experience
in management would be required.
6.        The course of study would cover approximately three months, of which at
least one month would involve practical silo experience. There should be at
least two trainees for each Project storage unit, one for managers' position,
the other for senior supervisor. Because of the number of personnel involved,
the training program should be conducted in two separate courses, the first in
late 1981 for managers and supervisors for the initial group of silos, the
second in 1982 to train personnel for the balance of the facilities.

GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Study to Evaluate Agricultural Land Use Strategy, Price
Support and Subsidy Programs
A. Background
1.        Agriculture is the most important sector in the Turkish economy.
Almost 60% of population is employed in this sector. Also, agriculture
generates 23% of the GNP and about 90% of the country's exports. The
Government is heavily involved in agriculture directly and indirectly
through market intervention. However, the structural problems in both
price policies and agricultural organization have led to large surpluses
of certain crops and deficits in others. The final burden of support prices
and subsidy programs of the Government has risen sharply and added to the
existing inflationary pressure on the economy. Recent publications of the
Ministry of Agriculture as well as an FAO study 1/ have identified the fol-
lowing factors as causes for these problems:
(a) Structural and organizational problems in determining support
prices for agricultural commodities. At present time, support
prices are fixed by cabinet decree separately for each of the
principal crops. The decisions are made on the basis of
information and often conflicting recommendations made by
different Government agencies and farmer organizations.
(b) Inconsistency of information and methodology in determining
agricultural prices and agricultural development policy.
Production costs have been taken as the primary basis for
price determination. However, each agency is using different
techniques and sources of information in estimating the produc-
tion costs. Since individual commodities are considered
separately, prices have not been used effectively as a policy
instrument in land use strategy.
(c) Announcement of prices comes too late to influence farmer
decision making on crop planning in the current year.  Usually,
the announcement of prices is made just before the harvest of
each major crop.
(d) Lack of production planning at regional and provincial level.
Even though the State Planning Organization sets a national
production target for each crop and animal product, there is
not available a detailed and consistent set of actions assuring
the availability in place and time of the required inputs,
investments and extension assistance to meet these production
targets.

-42 -                           ANNEX 5
2.        The Prime Minister's office has recognized these problems and has
authorized the Ministry of Agriculture to establish a special unit for
agricultural production planning. This unit has been established in March
1979 and has begun its work with organizing a comprehensive agricultural
information system in preparation for an integrated production planning
effort.
B.  Objectives
3.        The basic objectives of the Production Planning Unit are to:
(a) estimate demand and supply for the principal agricultural
commodities, taking into consideration international compa-
rative advantage as well as policy variables such as the
Government's self-sufficiency and employment goals;
*(b) Improve the system of determining support prices and input
subsidies in line with national production and incomes
policy objectives;
(c)  develop an integrated action plan that specifies detailed
input, investment and institutional requirements to achieve
the national production targets; and
(d) develop a comprehensive accounting system for the agricul-
tural sector that will provide reliable information about
production cost of farm commodities and about farm incomes.
4.        The specific objectives of the study to be carried out under the
project are to:
(a) formulate alternative land use strategies for Turkey that would
optimize resource allocation in the light of the supply-demand
balance referred to under 3(a) above;
(b)  evaluate present policies and procedures for determining farmer
support prices and input subsidies with a view to strengthen
their role in furthering the land use strategy selected;
(c) assess the implications for the Government's budget of the
present and alternative support price and input subsidies
programs together with related consumer price subsidies; and
(d) develop an action plan, based on the analyses referred to
under (a) through (c) above, giving recommendations for support
price and input subsidy levels, and investment, input and insti-
tutional requirements to achieve the Government's objectives.
C. Implementation
5.        This project will be carried out in Ankara, Turkey, by the General
Directorate of Planning, Research and Coordination of the Ministry of Agri-

Phasing
6.        A detailed work plan will be prepared and submitted to the Bank
for comments. The preliminary work plan, summarized in Annex 5, Chart
is as follows:
(a) Phase 1: The conceptual design of agricultural production
planning.
1.1 Collect and review work of a similar nature
done in Turkey and elsewhere.
1.2 Develop an overall agricultural production
planning concept, including detailed breakdown
of required economic analysis.
1.3 Determine and document the specific information
needs for each step of the analysis.
(b) Phase 2: Review and collection of required information.
2.1 Review relevant data available from all agencies
in the agricultural sector.
2.2 Determine the information gap, based on what is
needed in Task 1.3 and what is available in
Task 2.1 and develop a means to collect this
information. (This part of the work may be
coupled with the development of the agricultural
informat,ion system which is underway in the Minis-
try of Agriculture, with UNDP assistance.)
2.3 Collect the available information and put it in
form required for the analysis.
(c) Phase 3: Selection and implementation of computer programs.
3.1  Review the software, hardware and personnel
capabilities of the available computer centers
in Turkey. Determine the limitations and potential
of the available software in selected computer
sites.
3.2 Determine the needs for additional software and
review the software packages available from the
United States' National Technical Information
Services or other sources and adapt the selected
packages.
3.3 Perform the required analysis.
