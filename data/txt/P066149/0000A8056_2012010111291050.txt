                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Steady progress has been made towards SEP's Project Development Objective in the last year. However, implementation of project activities have has slowed in recent months,
                         owing to MONEs focus on internal reorganization and earthquake-recovery activities in VAN. The School Development Program (SDP) has made satisfactory progress and has
                         continued to generate interest at all levels of Government and local communities for further expansion. Consequently, the Government of Turkey has requested the Bank to expand
                         the SDP to 4 additional sub-provinces, covering 170 additional schools, along with an extension of the LOan Closing Date to April 30, 2012 .

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Given the steady progress towards SEP's Project's Development Objective , especially in the preparation and implementation of the School Development Program (SDP) grants, the
                         assessment of progress towards achieving the PDO is maintained at Moderately Satisfactory. A slow-down in project activities in recent months has resulted in implementation
                         progress being downgraded from MS to MU.
