1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1. Turkey’s Secondary Education Project (SEP) was approved by the World Bank’s Board of
Executive Directors on March 15, 2005. The Loan Agreement was signed on February 22, 2006.
The loan became effective on May 8, 2006, and closed on April 30, 2012.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2. Country and sector background. In 2001, less than four years before SEP was approved, the
Turkish economy had suffered a serious financial crisis with devastating consequences, including
a devaluation of the currency, a jump in nominal interest rates to 100 percent, the virtual collapse
of the banking system, and the bankruptcy of scores of enterprises. In the aftermath of the 2001
crisis, authorities announced a New Economic Program, which included a series of stabilization
measures. The combination of such interventions and the political stability that followed in
Turkey since 2002 helped the economy rebound from the crisis. During the 2002-05 period
Turkey enjoyed robust economic growth, with GDP growth averaging 7.3 percent annually.

3. According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), some of the challenges faced by
Turkey from an education perspective included:

    (i) Low educational attainment and learning achievement. Comparative international
    studies indicate that the educational attainment and educational performance of the Turkish
    population and labor force at the time of project appraisal were among the lowest of
    Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. In 2004,
    Turkey’s adult 1 population had, on average, less than 10 years of formal education, compared
    to the OECD average of 12 years. 2 Similarly, only 27 percent had completed upper secondary
    education, compared to an OECD average of 68 percent. 3 Low quality of secondary
    education was reflected in the 2003 results from OECD’s Program for International Student
    Assessment (PISA), which indicated that between 37 and 84 percent of Turkey’s 15-year-olds
    were not proficient in mathematics, reading, and problem solving beyond the lowest level of
    competency, including considerable proportions scoring below such level. 4 5

    (ii) A growing working-age population. Turkey’s working-age population grew by 10
    percent from 2000 to 2005 alone. 6 Sustained economic growth following the 2001 crisis
    provided the right conditions for generating new jobs vis-à-vis this increasing trend. This,
    however, would require future workers to acquire the relevant competencies and knowledge
    to be competitive in a rapidly changing, increasingly knowledge-intensive and global
    economy.

  The following percentages of Turkish 15-year old students participating in the 2003 PISA scored below
Level I, the lowest in the PISA scale: Mathematics, 27.7 percent; Reading: 12.5 percent; Problem-solving:
51.2 percent.

  Working-age population (15-64 years old) increased from 41 million in 2000, corresponding to 63.8% of
total population, to 45 million in 2005, corresponding to 65.7% of total population. Source: OECD

    (iii) Income inequality. Despite a steady decline over the previous four decades, income
    inequality remained a concern for Turkey. In 2004, Turkey’s poorest quintile of the
    population controlled 6 percent of total disposable household income, compared to 46.2
    percent controlled by the richest quintile. 7 Analytical work suggests a close link between
    income shares and education in Turkey. In 2005, for example, 56% of the lowest income
    quintile had only a primary school certificate compared to less than 35% for the richest
    quintile, while only 0.50% of households with a university degree belonged to the lowest
    quintile. 8

4. Rationale for Bank involvement. The main reasons behind the World Bank’s involvement in
Turkey’s Secondary Education Project can be summarized as follows:

    (i) Desire of the Bank to remain engaged in Turkey’s education sector. The three
    decades preceding SEP approval had seen the development and consolidation of a
    collaborative relationship between the World Bank and Turkey’s Ministry of National
    Education (MoNE). Eight projects had been implemented since then. The earlier projects
    focused on vocational education and training, but over time the priority shifted to projects
    supporting the Government’s broader education reform agenda. At the time of appraisal two
    operations, the First Basic Education Project (BEP 1) and the Second Basic Education Project
    (BEP 2), were still ongoing. Both of them encountered implementation difficulties and, at
    closing, were rated Unsatisfactory and Moderately Unsatisfactory, respectively, by the
    Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) on overall outcome.

    (ii) Bank experience in supporting reform programs similar to those being undertaken
    in Turkey. Turkey’s 8th National Development Plan, covering the period from 2001 to 2005,
    called for an extension of compulsory basic education from 8 to 12 years. Simultaneous with
    this expansion, the Government wished to align the structure and improve the quality of its
    secondary programs with those of the European Union (EU). According to the PAD, the
    Bank had supported similar reforms in nearby countries, working closely with the EU, and
    had international expertise in the areas of curriculum reform, integration of ICT in instruction
    and learning, career guidance and counseling, and assessments.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5. The original objective of the Project was “to improve the quality, economic relevance, and
equity of secondary education to support lifelong learning.? The key indicators were:

    (i) Secondary school graduates from schools receiving new curriculum and related support
    via the Project will have improved performance, as measured by scores on national and
    international assessments and graduate tracer studies, than those from schools not receiving
    project support.

    (ii) Secondary schools receiving new curriculum and related support via the Project will have
    a reduced variance in student achievement between schools in different regions, between
    general and vocational schools, and an overall rise in achievement.

                    overall rise in achievement.



7. The main reasons for the changes in the objective and design of the Project are summarized
below.

First Level I restructuring of March 25, 2008

     Request to finance a new activity. Soon after approval, MoNE formalized a proposal to
    finance teachers’ foreign language training overseas under SEP. Although this idea had been
    put forward earlier in the preparation stage, the Project, subject to time pressures on the
    Bank’s side, was approved without the activity, but with the understanding that it could be
    included shortly after. Project implementation stalled for three years while both parties tried
    to reach an agreement about this activity. This phase was characterized by intense and at
    times difficult discussions between MoNE and the Bank as well as within the Government
    itself, about the appropriateness of funding overseas teachers’ language training under SEP.
    The Bank expressed concerns over MoNE’s proposal on technical and efficiency grounds. In
    2008, with virtually no implementation, SEP was restructured to include a Training for

                                                  3
    Foreign Language Teachers sub-component at an estimated cost of Euro 24 million,
    corresponding to 30 percent of the loan amount. The component aimed at financing training
    for foreign language teachers, mostly English, in Turkey and overseas.

Second Level I restructuring of April 7, 2010

     Cancellation of newly added component. MoNE requested that the Training for
    Foreign Language Teachers sub-component be implemented with the support of a consulting
    firm, whose role would be to provide technical and logistical assistance in Turkey and
    overseas. A disagreement between MoNE and the Bank on the composition of the shortlist of
    consultancy firms and the inability to reach an agreement eventually resulted in a request by
    MoNE to drop the activity altogether. The Ministry requested that the funds previously
    allocated to this activity be reallocated towards a new sub-component in support of school
    grants.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8. The PAD puts great emphasis on social and gender dimensions, highlighting a need to focus
on students from poor families with low levels of adults’ education. It specifically notes that the
Project would target resources to schools with lower socio-economic status, and strengthen
education and career counseling to address social inclusion, job information flows, and equity
issues. Cited beneficiaries include students, teachers, parents, community leaders, policymakers,
and employers. Social and gender dimensions, however, were only marginally reflected in the
original project design through a reference to improved equity of secondary education in the
original PDO. This objective, to be measured by variance in performance between schools in
different socio-economic regions, was not supported by relevant project activities. In addition, it
is not clear how an intermediate indicator intended to measure improved equity in the university
selection process fit into the Project’s scope, though it was included in the original Results
Framework.

9. As part of the March 2008 restructuring, teachers became a more prominent beneficiary
group. A new component, Staff Development Capacity, was added to support teachers’ foreign
language training, which was eventually dropped, while vocational teachers in selected vocational
schools, and vocational schools themselves, would benefit from competitive grants under a new
Vocational Training Initiatives sub-component.

10. As part of the April 2010 restructuring, primary and secondary schools in sub-provinces with
low enrollment rates and in areas likely to have been more adversely affected by the global
economic crisis were to benefit from the newly introduced School Development Program (SDP)
sub-component.

1.5 Original Components

11. The Project, as described in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) consisted of two
components, each comprising three sub-components.

Component 1: Secondary Education Reform (Estimated cost at appraisal: Euro 64.7 million;
Actual disbursements: Euro 35.5 million):

     1.1 Secondary Education Programs. The objective was to revise and implement new
     general education and vocational education curriculum programs to provide students with
     core skills for the knowledge economy and lifelong learning.

                                                4
     1.2 Information and Communications Technology (ICT). The objective was to provide
     ICT training as a core competency for youth to function in a modern knowledge economy, to
     improve instruction by using ICT to expand access to learning opportunities, and to support
     better management of learning and administrative processes.

     1.3 Career Guidance and Counseling. The objective was to provide youth and adults
     with access to career information and guidance services to promote informed career choices
     and related education and training decisions and facilitate lifelong learning.

Component 2: Quality, Assessment and Management (Estimated cost at appraisal: Euro 5.5
million; Actual disbursements: Euro 3.8 million):

     2.1 Student Assessment and Evaluation. The objective was to improve the quality and
     outcomes of secondary education by developing systems to collect and disseminate reliable
     information on student learning and outcomes, and on the performance of the education
     system staff and institutions, and to use information from these assessments to improve
     system performance and student outcomes.

     2.2 School Development. The objective was to help secondary schools staff, parents, and
     students improve the performance and outcomes, educational achievement, and quality in
     education through school development activities to be designed and implemented within the
     school development process.

     2.3 Project Management. The objective was to ensure effective administration and
     coordination of the overall Project.

1.6 Revised Components

12. SEP’s components were revised twice during the course of implementation. The main
changes are summarized in Table 2 below (see Annex 10 for a detailed description).

13. The first revision took place as part of the Level I restructuring approved in March, 2008. A
new component, Staff Capacity Development, which included teachers’ foreign language training,
was added. In addition, the Project Management sub-component became a self-standing
component and was expanded to include Monitoring and Evaluation.

14. The second revision took place as part of the Level I restructuring approved in April, 2010
(see Section 1.3). The main changes were the introduction of a new School Development
Program sub-component, and the cancellation of the sub-component intended to finance training
for foreign language teachers.

1.7 Other significant changes

15. The Project underwent the following significant changes in addition to those outlined in
Sections 1.3 and 1.6:

       School Development Program (SDP) expansion. As part of a Level II, July 2011
      restructuring, following the availability of additional funds from the partial cancellation of an
      ICT contract (see Section 2) and the accelerating implementation of SDP, the program was
      scaled-up from 2,710 schools in 46 sub-provinces to include an additional 809 schools in 10
      new sub-provinces. Subsequently, as part of the Level II, December 2011 restructuring,
      MoNE requested to further expand the program to include an additional 170 schools in four
      new sub-provinces, on the basis of further project savings and continued progress of SDP. 9 In
      the original SDP design, schools were allowed to use up to 60 percent of total allocated
      amounts for the procurement of goods, with the rest allocated to services. In May 2011, this
      percentage was increased to 80 percent.10 The additional 10 sub-provinces included as part of
      the July 2011 restructuring, however, were given full flexibility.

       Cancellation of pilot and control schools for curriculum reform. In the original project
      design, 210 pilot general secondary education schools, 149 pilot vocational and technical
      schools, and 259 control schools were identified for the implementation of curriculum
      programs. As part of the March 2008 restructuring, MoNE and the Bank agreed that the
      notion of pilot and control schools no longer made sense, given MoNE's plans to implement
      revised curricula in all secondary education schools over the following two years. As a result,
      it was decided that SEP would support the development and implementation of curriculum
      reform in all schools in Turkey while supplying materials and equipment to a selected
      number of schools.

       Changes in the number of schools receiving materials and equipment, including ICT.
      The introduction of a new component on Staff Capacity Development, as part of the March
      2008 restructuring, resulted in a significant reallocation of funds. This led to a reduction in
      the number of general secondary education schools which would receive equipment and
      supplies (from 280 to 210) and to a reduction in the number of schools which would receive
      ICT equipment (from 400 to 322). Subsequently, as part of the April 2010 restructuring,
      provision of ICT equipment was scaled up from 322 schools to 1,629 schools, identified
      across Turkey on the basis of classrooms and students’ numbers, targeting students in grades
      1 through 5. ICT expansion was made possible through a reallocation of funds, mostly from
      Career Guidance and Counseling, Student Assessment, and M&E.

       Three loan closing date extensions, for a cumulative period of 23 months. The loan
      closing date was extended three times, within the scope of the March 2008, April 2010, and
      December 2011 restructurings. The first, a seven-month extension from May 31, 2010 to
      December 31, 2010, aimed to allow the implementation of a new component, Staff Capacity
      Development, and of the expanded Project Management, Monitoring & Evaluation
      component. The loan closing date was extended a second time by 12 months, from December
      31, 2010 to December 31, 2011, to allow the implementation of the newly added School
      Development Program (SDP). The last extension, from December 31, 2011 to April 30, 2012,
      aimed to allow the completion of all activities under the SDP and under the Secondary



9
    Of the 3,689 targeted schools, 18 were closed. As a result, SDP funds were used by 3,671 schools.

     As reflected in the Project’s Operational Manual dated May, 2011
                                                      7
   Education Reform component, in particular the delivery of goods and equipment needed for
   training associated with curriculum reform.

    Loan funds reallocations.          Throughout implementation, SEP underwent several
   reallocations of funds to reflect changes in project design. All reallocations were approved as
   part of the restructurings.

    Results Framework revisions. SEP’s Results Framework underwent two significant
   revisions as part of the March 2008 and April 2010 restructurings, to reflect changes in the
   PDO and project design. Some ISRs reflected different key indicators and targets than those
   reported in the approved results frameworks.

    Cancellation of most of the originally planned assessments and surveys. The PDO
   revision during the April 2010 restructuring was accompanied by a further scaling-down of
   the M&E activities, including the cancellation of most of the assessments and surveys
   planned in the original design. These included: (i) graduate tracer studies and qualitative
   parent and student surveys to assess the impact of curricula reform and ICT skills; (ii) an
   independent review of revised curricula and teaching; (iii) a student survey and assessment to
   measure the improvement of student decision-making as a result of the new career guidance
   system; (iv) an ICT impact assessment to measure the extent to which ICT skills improved in
   322 selected schools; (v) annual assessment of teacher performance as part of the school
   performance management system; and (vi) an impact study on the overall Project. The
   cancellation of such studies is not discussed in the 2010 Restructuring Paper, but only
   reflected in the revised Results Framework.



2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

16. Key strengths of project preparation are summarized below:

    Frequent interaction of the Bank both at the central ministry and beneficiary levels.
   Documentation from the preparation phase indicates regular communication between MoNE
   and the Bank. Treasury and the Ministry of Development were also closely involved in
   preparation, and took the opportunity to comment on Aide Memoires and other relevant
   documents. The Bank also had frequent interactions with targeted beneficiaries, such as
   informal focus group discussions with parents, school foundation members, teachers, and
   school staff and students in different regions, and multiple meetings with key stakeholders
   representatives, including labor and the enterprise sector, and Non-Governmental
   Organizations (NGO).

    Extensive analytical work conducted to provide inputs to project design. The PAD lists
   several pieces of analytical work as having contributed to project design. These include a
   Knowledge Economy Assessment, a Poverty Survey that included questions directly related to
   the functioning of the education system in Turkey, labor sector analysis and surveys, and
   “additional education sector work?.

    Complementarities with EU program. At the time of approval, the EU had two ongoing
   investment projects supporting the reform of secondary vocational education programs. The
   goals of the EU’s two ongoing projects, Strengthening the Vocational Education and
                                               8
     Training System Project and Modernization of Vocational and Technical Education Project,
     were to establish a more qualified vocational education and training system in line with EU
     standards, and to further modernize and adapt the system to make vocational education and
     training more responsive to the socio-economic needs of the country and to the key principles
     of lifelong learning. SEP was designed to complement these two operations.

17. However, several shortcomings undermined the quality of project preparation and design.

      Limited initial client ownership, attributed to several factors:

       (i) A broadly-owned secondary education strategy was not in place. The PAD contains
           references to government plans for reforming secondary education, as outlined in the
           8th National Development Plan. The key elements of such reform were an increase in
           compulsory education from 8 to 12 years, with a corresponding extension of the
           secondary school cycle from three to four years, and an increase in secondary education
           enrollment. The PAD indicates that, simultaneous with this expansion, the Government
           wished to align the structure and improve the quality of its secondary programs with
           those of the European Union, broaden vocational secondary programs to better reflect
           the needs of the knowledge economy, and allow increased flexibility to move between
           programs and schools. The PAD, however, does not contain any references to a specific
           secondary education strategy, while documentation from the preparation phase
           indicates that such strategy was not in place and that basic policy reform agreements
           were reached in the course of project design. 11 According to MoNE officials, the main
           implication of this was an overall lack of clarity within MoNE on how to best utilize
           Bank funds, resulting in a fragmented design approach, with activities being adapted to
           the Project’s financial envelope rather than built on a strategy-based needs assessment.
           As MoNE’s General Directorates each put forward their respective priorities, the
           original design came to include several sub-components addressing very different and
           complex areas - from curriculum reform to ICT, career guidance and counseling,
           student assessment and evaluation, and school development – lacking synergies within
           a common strategic framework.

       (ii) The initial dialogue on project design appears to have been driven largely by the World
            Bank, with the support of Treasury and the Ministry of Development (MoD). The Bank
            had an interest in maintaining education as an area of engagement in Turkey and to
            have the Project delivered under the 2004-07 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), while
            Treasury and the MoD welcomed Bank financing and technical expertise. The
            implication was that SEP was perceived by the Ministry of National Education (MoNE)
            as a supply-driven Project without clear ownership, despite addressing key areas of
            reform.

       (iii) MoNE’s lack of strong incentives to borrow from the Bank. The fact that Bank
             financing would not translate into new budget resources for MoNE was a contributing
             factor to the Ministry’s low interest in the Project. This was compounded by MoNE’s
             then-recent experience with two problematic education projects.



11
 The May 2001 Identification Aide Memoire, for example, states that during the identification mission
agreement was reached on priority areas for investment that could support the development of a
comprehensive secondary education system for Turkey. Furthermore, the November 2001 minutes of the
Concept Review Meeting point to a clear perception of the need for reform within and outside MoNE, but
no consensus or discussion on how to bring that about.
                                                  9
  (iv) The original project design differed from MoNE’s initial request. An Aide Memoire
       dated as early as April 2006, before loan effectiveness, indicates MoNE’s intention to
       include overseas teachers’ training into the Project. This idea, according to MoNE and
       Bank officials, had been brought forward prior to project approval. However, the
       Project was submitted for approval without the inclusion of the activity but with
       assurance by the Bank that it could be easily incorporated shortly after. In fact, this was
       not the case and following project approval the Bank voiced technical concerns over
       MoNE’s proposal. In retrospect, submitting the Project for approval leaving this issue
       unresolved is likely to have contributed to a stalling of implementation for three years,
       with a negative impact on project ownership and on the dialogue between MoNE and
       the Bank.

 Overly ambitious and broad PDO. At the Project Concept Note stage, concerns were
raised over the difficulty to achieve multiple reform objectives and suggestions were made to
focus on one objective or implement them incrementally. However, the Project maintained
an ambitious objective and went on to finance a broad set of activities.

 Inconsistencies between sector background analysis and diagnosis, as described in the
PAD, and actual project design. The PAD emphasizes the Government’s goals to improve
equity and reduce disparities in the quality of education, and to improve the participation of
girls and children from low income families. The PAD further states that these issues are
consistent with the Project’s focus on schools serving students from poorer families with low
levels of education. However, as stated earlier, these dimensions were not adequately
reflected in project design. The PAD also cites the issue of flexibility within secondary
education and into tertiary education and other issues identified through analytical work, such
as access to education and the link between education and employment. Although the latter
would theoretically be addressed through revisions of curricula, in so far as they would
become more relevant to employment needs, the Project did not incorporate activities to
address the above aspects directly.

 Excessively long and costly preparation. SEP preparation, from Concept Note to
approval, took 42 months, well above Turkey’s average of 18 months in Fiscal Year 2005.
This was indicative of some of the underlying issues described above.

 Important lessons from earlier operations not adequately incorporated into project
design. These include: (i) the need to keep project design straightforward, simple and realistic,
with a scope appropriate to existing implementation capacity; (ii) the importance of having a
robust monitoring and evaluation system in place before project launching (see Section 2.3);
and (iii) the need to pay close attention to the political, social and institutional aspects of
education reforms (see Section 6).

 Key risks not adequately identified and/or mitigated. The PAD rates MoNE’s
Implementation Capacity risk as the highest, citing activity reporting issues, weak
accountability and complex management systems, and a lack of follow-up and feedback
mechanisms. Mitigating measures included putting in place a dedicated SEP team within
MoNE, utilization of a Project Implementation Plan, and consolidation of technical assistance
for each component to reduce the complexity of procurement. On the other hand, the PAD
omitted to explicitly discuss fiduciary issues, and SEP was ultimately designed as a
procurement-intensive operation despite concept-stage concerns within the Bank at the
prospect of adding another project to MoNE, given the difficulties it experienced in
implementing procurement according to the Bank's guidelines under BEP 1. The PAD is also
silent on the political economy risks that ended up affecting implementation (see Section 6).

                                             10
       Failure to implement a project preparation grant. Project preparation was to be
      supported by a US$286,000 Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant 12, of
      which only US$31,000 was disbursed. The grant was approved in June 1999, became
      effective in March 2001 and closed in June 2003, after two extensions. Funds were mostly
      allocated to develop a methodology for streamlining existing secondary general and
      vocational educational programs, develop new training programs for the new curricula, and
      provide technical assistance for the development of a career guidance system. The PAD states
      that delays due to multiple factors, including changes in Government leadership, Government
      policy efforts directed at the Basic Education Program, and several changes in the Bank’s
      task team caused the grant to be closed without any significant disbursement.

18. Quality Assurance Group (QAG)’s assessment of Quality at Design was Moderately
Unsatisfactory. SEP was included in a Quality Assessment of the Lending Portfolio (QALP) in
October 2008. The assessment rated Quality of Design as Moderately Unsatisfactory. It found
that the March 2008 Project restructuring resulted in a more realistic PDO and positively
acknowledged the inclusion of the Training for Foreign Language Teachers’ sub-component.
Main weaknesses identified include: (i) original design not including training for foreign
language teachers, despite it being thought to be desirable; (ii) inappropriateness of the outcome
indicator related to increased scores on the PISA and National Assessment, judged as unrealistic
and with attribution issues; (iii) implementation arrangements not sufficiently capturing the
institutional and cultural complexities of MoNE’s bureaucracy; and (iv) lack of focus and follow-
up on equity, despite it having been extensively discussed at the Decision Meeting and noted in
the PAD. The QAG review argued that if equity was not a major issue to be addressed in the
Project, such a shift should have been addressed during restructuring. However, it noted that the
Project Paper submitted to the Board in 2008 states that the proposed changes were not expected
to have an impact of the Project's original social aspects.


2.2 Implementation

19. Positive features of implementation allowed the Bank and MoNE to overcome challenging
design and implementation issues, and ultimately agree on a design that was highly owned at all
levels of MoNE.

       New teams and approach. After a long period of underperformance, implementation went
      through an impressive turnaround during the last two years. Two main factors contributed to
      this: (i) the introduction of the School Development Program (SDP), which represented a
      milestone in MoNE’s ownership of the Project. With exceptional efforts on the part of MoNE
      and the Bank, the SDP was designed and implemented quickly; (ii) the ability of new Bank
      and Project Coordination Center (PCC) teams to revamp a dialogue which had been
      hampered by persistent implementation issues and differing views on how to address them.
      The last two years of implementation were repeatedly referred to by MoNE as the most
      constructive phase since project inception, characterized by increased responsiveness and
      flexibility on the Bank’s side. These efforts translated in a disbursement of about Euro 62
      million during this period, corresponding to 77 percent of loan funds; SDP accounted for half
      of this amount.

                                                 11
    Bank’s desire to remain engaged in Turkey’s education sector. The decision to retain
   and extend SEP in spite of a history of non-performance provided an opportunity for the
   Bank to remain more deeply engaged in a sector of high importance to Turkey’s development.

    Decentralized Bank team. A Bank team consisting largely of country-based staff provided
   regular implementation support to the client. Country-based procurement and financial
   management staff was an integral part of the project team and facilitated the resolution of
   most fiduciary issues emerging throughout implementation, also thanks to a solid
   understanding of the country context. An Operations Officer, also country-based, functioned
   as a liaison between the Washington-based Task Team Leader (TTL) and the Project
   Coordination Center (PCC).

20. At the same time, implementation suffered from a number of shortcomings and delays,
including some that were not entirely under the Bank’s or the PCC’s control.

    Pressures to deliver and disburse. Following a long preparation period, the Bank found
   itself under pressure to finalize and approve SEP, which was the only education project
   included in the 2004-07 CAS. However, as already mentioned, unresolved design issues
   would ultimately lead to a lack of implementation for three years. Similarly, pressures to
   disburse funds following a long history of unsatisfactory performance later contributed to
   some SDP design shortcomings and an overall decrease in strategic relevance.

    Political economy factors. Political transitions affected project implementation and
   content. SEP’s seven-year implementation history saw the appointment of four Education
   ministers. Even though some level of continuity was maintained at MoNE’s under-secretariat
   level, implementation delays occurred as new consensus needed to be built during each
   transition, which often resulted in new agendas and priorities.

    Staff turnover. On the Bank’s side, SEP task team leaders (TTL) changed three times,
   while two additional TTLs led the preparation phase. Similarly, MoNE’s PCC was led by
   three different directors, and its operations were somewhat affected by staff turnover at the
   technical level. Although these changes were not a key factor in project delays, they did cause
   some discontinuity, because of the time needed for new teams to become familiar with the
   Project and respective counterparts.

    Technical and relationship challenges. For good part of implementation, technical
   disagreements between MoNE and the Bank over project content and procurement
   procedures delayed implementation, and also negatively impacted the dialogue between the
   two parties.

    Request for evidence of progress from the ongoing Basic Education Project. Although
   SEP was approved in March 2005, Turkey’s Council of Ministers’ ratification and
   publication in the Official Gazette of SEP’s loan agreement, necessary to declare
   effectiveness, came only one year after Bank approval. The reason for this delay was largely
   linked to the Ministry of Development’s request to see some progress on the ongoing Second
   Basic Education Project (BEP 2) prior to moving forward with the implementation of a new
   operation.




                                               12
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

21. The original M&E design was hindered by unrealistic and unattributable indicators.
The original Results Framework was built around broad and longer-term outcome indicators that
were unrealistic both in terms of (i) the time needed to see the results of major curriculum reform
in student learning and employment outcomes; and (ii) the difficulty in attributing changes in
such outcomes to project interventions, considering the many factors involved. During
implementation, this should have been addressed through the use of more realistic, shorter-term
intermediate indicators. Instead, unrealistic indicators were replaced by ones that were vague,
subjective, and difficult to quantify, such as beneficiaries’ satisfaction with the use of school
grants. In addition, the original Results Framework lacked meaningful baselines, while the
instruments to be used for collecting information were vaguely defined, with no explanation on
how some of the planned reports, assessments, and graduate tracer studies would be carried out.

22. Results indicators were progressively reduced in scope and in their outcome-focus,
reflecting changes in the Project’s development objective as well as the shorter
implementation period remaining after each restructuring. As part of the 2010 restructuring
the Results Framework was significantly simplified, with limited emphasis on outcomes.
Indicators became largely output-oriented, while most of the originally planned surveys and
assessments were deleted. It should be noted that the increasingly limited time left for
implementation after each restructuring made it inevitable to choose revised objectives and
indicators that were more short-term and output-oriented. The SDP intermediate outcome:
“Schools in districts with low enrollment rates benefit from school grants designed to improve
quality and/or increase enrollment? was an exception, in that it was more outcome-oriented. This
intermediate outcome was never monitored during implementation, because it was judged to be
unrealistic given the short amount of time available for implementation.

23. M&E implementation was significantly scaled back over the life of the Project, limiting
evidence on effectiveness of project activities. The original project design did not include any
M&E component but extensive M&E activities were listed in the Results Framework to assess the
outcomes of project activities. During the March 2008 restructuring a self-standing M&E sub-
component was introduced, with an allocation of Euro 1.57 million. While this was a positive
development, the sub-component was overly ambitious and vague, particularly with reference to
an “evaluation of the overall impact of the Project on the quality and relevance of education?.
Although the M&E sub-component’s description remained unchanged throughout
implementation, its targets were significantly scaled-back after each restructuring. Initial plans to
conduct project impact studies were substituted by a more generic reference to key project
assessment studies. Accordingly, funding allocations were cut back by 67 percent, to Euro 0.52
million. While the cancellation of such impact studies was in line with project design changes and
a shortening implementation period, efforts should have been made to maintain or introduce other
means to measure the effectiveness of key activities financed under SEP. For example, the Project
financed in-service training to some 59,000 teachers and administrators, but without any
independent evaluation of the effectiveness of such training. Also, no assessment of the Career
Information System was carried out, even though the website became effective two years before
project closing.

24. Beneficiary assessments were a valuable instrument to better understand project
contributions. The three Beneficiary Assessments conducted under SEP for Curricula Reform,
Vocational Training Initiatives, and School Development Program, provided useful insights on
beneficiaries’ views of project activities and generated useful lessons. However, as noted in some
of the assessments themselves, the lack of baseline surveys and of ongoing monitoring and


                                                 13
evaluation activities from the outset limited the usefulness of those results in terms of assessing
the Project’s achievements.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

25. SEP did not trigger any safeguard policies, and was rated as a Category C project. As
part of the SDP design, both the Loan Agreement and the SDP Operational Manual were
amended to specify the types of expenses eligible for small civil works. These were limited to: (i)
improving the hygiene conditions in the lavatories and wash rooms of the schools by means of
rehabilitation and/or renewal of sanitary facilities; (ii) improving lavatories and wash rooms of
the schools by means of rehabilitation and/or renewal of sanitary facilities; and (iii) improving the
energy efficiency in the schools by replacing the lighting facilities with "A class" energy saving
bulbs and minor heat isolation works to improve heat losses through the walls, doors and
windows. Given the small size of grants, the Bank did not require a separate safeguards review.

Procurement

26. MoNE’s procurement capacity improved over time, and procurement activities were
mostly carried out in compliance with Bank’s policy and procedural requirements. The
PCC’s procurement capacity was inadequate at the initial phase of implementation, but improved
through an increase in the number of procurement specialists to four. During the last two years,
two of them left but the effect of their departure was mitigated by civil servants taking over some
of the procurement activities.

27. Nonetheless, procurement-related issues posed significant challenges to project
implementation, generating tensions between MoNE and the Bank and taking time to find
mutually satisfactory resolutions. Noteworthy examples include: (i) a disagreement between
MoNE and the Bank on the shortlist composition of consultancy firms to carry out the teachers’
foreign language training led to the cancellation of this Euro 24 million component; (ii) another
disagreement between MoNE and Bank on the technical specifications for the procurement of
322 ICT classrooms estimated at Euro 6 million also led to the cancellation of this activity. (iii)
Bank's conclusion that MoNE did not carry out the procurement of ICT equipment for 1,629
secondary education schools in accordance with Bank's Procurement Guidelines. This resulted
from differences between national and Bank procurement rules with regards to the participation
of nationally debarred firms, for which the Turkish Procurement Law, differing from Bank rules,
explicitly indicates that national regulations prevail over international financial agreements, such
as those stipulated with the Bank itself. Part of this procurement was completed with contracts
worth Euro 5.75 million for the provision of photocopiers and projectors while the remaining,
amounting to about Euro 7 million, was cancelled by MoNE. Funds resulting from the above
cancellations were eventually reallocated to other activities during project restructurings.

Financial Management

28. The Project was in compliance with the audit requirements of the loan agreement.
Treasury Controllers audited the Project on an annual basis and submitted their reports and
management letters on a timely basis. The opinions were unqualified (clean). Following the
introduction and rapid implementation of the School Development Program (SDP), the Bank’s
Financial Management Team requested an internal audit report of the Program, which was never
received.

                                                 14
29. Nonetheless, financial management performance fluctuated throughout implementation,
with issues related to quality and reliability of reporting. These were largely attributable to
high turnover and lack of sufficiently qualified staff in the PCC. In addition, the Project
maintained the accounting data in outdated financial management software that was procured for
the previous Basic Education Project. The software did not enable the generation of adequate
reports and the PCC eventually shifted to using spreadsheets to maintain project accounts. These
issues resulted in a downgrade of financial management (FM) performance to Moderately
Unsatisfactory in November 2009 in the annual FM Supervision Report. The rating was reversed
to Moderately Satisfactory shortly after, following specific remedial actions taken or planned by
the PCC. Overall, FM reporting was generally acceptable until the last semester of 2011. Issues of
quality and reliability of FM reporting re-emerged in the months leading to the closing of the loan.
The PCC did not submit acceptable reports in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 and for the
year 2012. 13 From the second half of 2011 onwards, in addition to recurrent staffing issues, some
errors and delays in the interim un-audited financial reports indicated some level of internal
controls deficiencies over financial reporting. These factors, together with the lack of an audit
report for the SDP, resulted in a second downgrade of FM performance to Moderately
Unsatisfactory in the last FM Supervision Report, dated April 2012.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

30. Curriculum reform was a priority of the Government at the time of SEP preparation,
and is likely to be sustained in the long run through Government funding. MoNE’s
implementation of curriculum reform at the national level and good implementation progress of
this sub-component further point to strong commitment in this area.

31. Despite its popularity, the SDP ceased operation at project closing and the central
management capacity has been disbanded. Furthermore, the future of school financing
decentralization in Turkey is not yet certain. On the national level, the implementation of SDP
coincided with a sector capacity building project which identified decentralization as an important
aspect of the Turkish education system. By demonstrating the viability of decentralized financing,
the SDP is seen to have contributed substantially to the ongoing dialogue and planning for
decentralization. There is a risk, however, that the momentum created by SDP at local and
national levels will not be sustained, considering that MoNE’s immediate priority is
implementation of the compulsory 12-year education program and that the development of
detailed plans for decentralization would be a complex and time consuming process likely to meet
with some resistance.

32. Prospects of future operations are uncertain. While the World Bank and MoNE continue
to develop an analytical program, 14 and the ongoing 2012-15 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
indicates a potential education project in FY15, the prospects of this materializing appear
uncertain at this stage. It should be noted, as indicated by MoNE officials, that the Ministry’s
inclination to borrow from the Bank is affected by a number of factors, including: (i) perception



13
   Although the PCC did not submit acceptable financial reports for the third and fourth quarters of 2011,
the auditors (Treasury Controllers) issued a clean audit opinion on the 2011 annual project financial
statements. Therefore, the overdue reports for the third and fourth quarters of 2011 are considered as
submitted. The 2012 reports are still outstanding at the time of the ICR.

MoNE’s preference to work with its own procurement guidelines and operational procedures; and
(iv) availability of EU grants.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

33. Relevance of the original PDO is rated High. Notwithstanding its overly ambitious design,
the original PDO’s focus on improving the quality and economic relevance of secondary
education was in line with Turkey’s desire to adapt to the knowledge economy, as noted in the
8th National Development Plan. The Project was listed under the 2004-07 CAS for Turkey,
which pursued four major objectives: (i) supporting sound macroeconomic management and
governance; (ii) promoting equitable human and social development; (iii) creating a more
attractive business climate; and (iv) strengthening environmental management and disaster
preparedness and mitigation capacity. SEP was designed to support the second objective and,
indirectly, the third by enhancing the development of human capital. In the 2008-11 CPS,
education is highlighted as an important element, in view of the importance of skills to improve
competitiveness and employment, and its role in reducing inequalities. In the CPS,
implementation of the Secondary Education Project was expected to contribute to the
achievement of the Government’s strategic target of considerably increasing the net enrollment
rate in secondary education, which, however, was not an objective of the Project, and improving
the quality of secondary education by updating curriculum, providing effective use of ICT and
raising qualification of teachers.

34. Education as a whole remains a priority in Turkey and was identified as the biggest
area of concern for the Turkish people, according to a recent World Bank survey of 29
countries in the Europe and Central Asia Region. According to the survey, roughly 5 in 10
Turkish citizens believe that education should be the highest priority area for additional
Government investment. 15 In this context, the Bank’s engagement in Turkey’s education sector
continues to be highly relevant.

35. While the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) recognizes that the
original Project development objective (PDO) was overly ambitious, the two revisions to it
also meant that it lost its strategic relevance in terms of the Government's overall program
and the CPS's objectives. As a result, relevance is rated Modest for the two revised PDOs.

      SEP was approved in March 2005 as an ambitious reform project. In March 2008, three
     years later and with virtually no disbursements, the Project was restructured and its
     development objective narrowed down, becoming fragmented and output-oriented. The
     justification for the introduction of teachers’ foreign language training was not supported by
     evidence that this was an essential element in Turkey’s reform of the education system, and
     both the Bank and other Government agencies had raised concerns over the activity’s
     relevance and efficiency.

      Two years later, in April 2010, following limited progress, the Project was restructured
     again and its development objective further narrowed down to focus solely on improving

    conditions for student learning, to be achieved largely through the provision of school grants
    and through continued revision of curricula. The basis for the School Development Program
    (SDP), as outlined in the 2010 Restructuring Paper, was that the economic crisis in Turkey
    had made it harder for parents and families to provide support to their local schools,
    adversely impacting learning conditions at schools in economically disadvantaged areas. The
    new SDP was designed to provide additional assistance to schools in areas likely to have been
    affected adversely by the economic downturn, and thus ameliorate the effects of the
    economic slowdown while building capacity at primary and secondary schools. However, no
    evidence is available that schools in selected sub-provinces had been adversely affected by
    the crisis, and that this had translated into worsening learning conditions. In fact, when the
    SDP was designed, data at the sub-provincial level were not available for economic variables
    but only for educational variables, most notably net enrollment rate for primary schooling,
    which was ultimately chosen as the driving targeting criteria.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Original PDO: To improve the quality, economic relevance, and equity of secondary education
to support lifelong learning.

Key Performance Indicators                                             Status
1. Secondary school graduates from schools receiving new               Achieved but no evidence
   curriculum and related support via the Project will have            meaningfully linkable to
   improved performance, as measured by scores on national and         project.
   international assessments and graduate tracer studies, than those
   from schools not receiving project support.
2. Secondary schools receiving new curriculum and related support      Not achieved
   via the Project will have a reduced variance in student             (lack of evidence)
   achievement between schools in different socio-economic
   regions, between general and vocational schools, and an overall
   rise in achievement.

36. No evidence on improved student performance and reduced variance in student
achievement between schools. According to the PAD’s Results Framework, improvements in
student performance and reduced variance across schools from different socio-economic regions
were to be measured through (i) an annual administrative report on flow to higher education; (ii)
student follow-up surveys; (iii) results from the Program for International Student Assessment
(PISA); and (iv) annual national assessments. None of these planned reporting and assessments
were conducted under the original PDO. Both PDO and key performance indicators were
eventually judged to be overly ambitious and unrealistic, as many factors are known to contribute
to improved student performance, with curriculum reform being just one of them. The indicator
on reduced variance between schools was removed from the Results Framework as part of the
2008 restructuring. All remaining references to improved student performance were removed
from the project’s Results Framework as part of the 2010 restructuring.

           37. Achievement of the original PDO is rated Highly Unsatisfactory. Implementation under
           the original objective was very limited, with no measurable contributions to the PDO. In the three
           years since approval, disbursements amounted to Euro 1.85 million, corresponding to two percent
           of loan funds. None of the key performance and intermediate outcome indicators were met.
           Notwithstanding the good progress on curriculum reform throughout the remaining of project
           implementation, project activities cannot be meaningfully linked to improvements in quality,
           economic relevance, and equity of secondary education.


           Revised PDO (March 25, 2008 – April 7, 2010): To support the Government’s reform of
           general secondary and vocational education by improving conditions for student learning,
           establishing a career guidance system and enhancing foreign language teaching.

           Key Performance Indicators                                 Status
           1. Improved student performance as measured by             Achieved but no evidence
              national and international assessments.                 meaningfully linkable to Project.
           2. Improved curricula and teaching, based on an            Largely achieved (but no follow-up
              independent review.                                     independent assessment after 2008).
           3. Improved foreign language capabilities of teachers to   Not achieved
              enhance future student foreign language capacity, as
              measured by assessments carried out following the
              training.
           4. Improved student decision-making as a result of the     Not achieved
              new career guidance system, as measured by a survey     (lack of evidence)
              of students.

           38. Student performance improved between 2003 and 2009, but there is no evidence linking
           these achievements to Project interventions. From 2003 to 2009, the performance of Turkish
           students in PISA assessments improved significantly, with a sharp increase over the last three
           years (Figure 1). The rise in quality was accompanied by a decrease in inequality, evidenced by a
           narrower performance gap between the richest and poorest students (Figure 2). However, it would
           be difficult to link these improvements to the Project as in 2009, by the time the PISA was



                                                          18
administered, only few curricula had been developed within the scope of SEP, and with a limited
implementation period. 16 No study was carried out to evaluate the Project’s contribution to
learning achievement and this indicator was removed from the Results Framework in 2010 with a
consensus that such link was unrealistic. Given the lack of any sort of evaluation of the
curriculum reform undertaken under SEP, it is not possible to determine how this activity
contributed to better learning outcomes for students in Turkey.

39. Progress was made on curriculum revisions, but with no evidence of improved teaching
methods. Between 2008 and 2010, implementation of the curricula reform component made
considerable progress. According to MoNE’s Progress Report No. 4, as of mid-April 2010, 49 out
of 66 curricula had been revised for most of the grades from 9 to 12. Of these, 14 had been
published or were in the process of being published, and most of the corresponding textbooks had
been published or were under review. Improvements in the quality of the new general and
vocational-technical secondary education curricula were assessed through an Assessment of the
Beneficiaries of the Curriculum Reform of the Secondary Education Project, undertaken in April
2012. The assessment highlights both strengths and weaknesses of the revised curricula. On the
one hand, revised curricula were generally judged appropriate with respect to teaching, learning
process, and measurement and evaluation dimensions. Beneficiaries also indicated an overall high
level of satisfaction, including positive opinions on the possibility to integrate ICT into teaching
and learning process, apply diverse methods, and link between teaching and assessment. On the
other hand, aspects related to context, objectives/attainments, content measurement and, for some
subjects, evaluation, were judged to be partly appropriate. One of the most important
shortcomings identified by beneficiaries was a lack of a clearly defined philosophy and learning
theory underlying the curricula reform.

40. No progress made towards improving teachers’ foreign language skills. The sub-
component in support of this objective was fully cancelled at the request of MoNE before any
implementation took place.

41. A career guidance system is in place, but it is too early to see its benefits. As part of SEP,
a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Turkish Employment Agency
(ISKUR), the Ministry of Development, the Council of Higher Education, and other relevant
institutions. In close partnership with these agencies, a new web-based Career Information
System (CIS) was developed and launched on April 1, 2010. The CIS (http://mbs.meb.gov.tr) is
run by the Special Education General Directorate of MoNE. Designed to provide support to
people of all ages based on the principle of lifelong learning, it includes three main sections: (i) a
self-assessment of abilities, interests, and career values; (ii) an overview of available educational
options; and (iii) labor market information, opportunities, and job application tools, including
guidance on CV and preparation of job application letters. The website also includes several links
to Turkish institutions, including ISKUR. By project closing the CIS website grew to 1.3 million
registered users, against a target of 300,000. The scope of the CIS, however, remains limited in
that it does not yet connect individuals and institutions to employers and existing job openings.
Plans are underway to further evolve the system and to better serve the needs of various
beneficiaries. A survey of CIS users, planned under the original project design, was deleted as

  Four general secondary education curricula for Turkish literature, Mathematics, Geography, and
Language and Expression were developed in 2004-05 by MoNE outside of the scope of the Project, and
implemented in the 2005/06, 2006/07 and 2007/08 academic years, respectively, for grades 9, 10, and 11.
Between end-2008 and mid-2009, the Project directly supported the revision of curricula for grade 11 for
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and History.

part of the 2010 review of the Results Framework, along with the intermediate outcome indicator
measuring improved students’ decision-making on education and career choices as a result of
strengthened career guidance services. At the time of the ICR no evidence is thus available to
evaluate the effectiveness and benefits of the system.

42. Insufficient evidence to determine the contributions of Vocational Training Initiatives
(VTI) to the PDO. Although the PDO makes a reference to vocational education reform, and a
Vocational Training Initiative (VTI) sub-component was added as part of the 2008 restructuring,
a result indicator and a target for this activity were only introduced during the 2010 restructuring,
after VTI implementation had been completed. De facto, the target value reported in subsequent
ISRs was the actual achieved result. The relevant intermediate outcome was vague and not easily
measurable: “Vocational schools benefit from competitive school grants designed to modernize
vocational training methods and education technologies?, and no directly relevant outcome
indicators were introduced to measure the contributions of VTIs in terms of improved conditions
of student learning in secondary education (PDO). The VTI sub-component financed grants to
vocational technical schools on a competitive basis, with the aim of promoting innovation, and
improving the quality of vocational secondary programs and their relevance to employment needs.
A total of 433 applications were received, of which 46 proposals were accepted from 33
provinces and were implemented between 2008 and 2009. Evidence of outcomes is limited to the
opinions of participating staff of the vocational schools, as reported in the Beneficiary Assessment.
Participating teachers and administrators considered the impact of the initiatives to have been
positive on all the levels examined: program development, professional development, school-
industry cooperation, suitability to project goals, contribution to student-based learning, and
sustainability. The highest impact was found to be on staff professional development. However,
the Beneficiary Assessment report also flagged significant weaknesses with respect to the impact
on school-industry relationships and sustainability. It was found that, while initiatives did tend to
foster existing school-industry relationships, they did not facilitate the development of new ones.
The benefits of both staff professional development and the provision of new equipment were
thought not to be readily sustainable considering that: (i) foreign language skills regressed
quickly without regular practice and follow-up training; (ii) the pace of technological change
meant that new equipment quickly became out of date; and (iii) keeping up with relevant
technology depended on close cooperation with industry which was often lacking. Overall, the
design and implementation of the VTI sub-component did not take into account the constraints to
promoting initiative at the school level and building effective school-industry cooperation in a
centralized and hierarchical education system.

43. Achievement of the revised PDO is rated Unsatisfactory. Under the revised PDO,
implementation progressed on several fronts, including the successful establishment of a Career
Information System, an increased number of revised curricula, and implementation of several
vocational training proposals. At the same time, PDO relevance weakened, while overall
implementation remained slow, with only Euro 15 million disbursed five years after original
project approval, corresponding to 19 percent of total loan funds. No evidence is available to
assess PDO achievement, with the exception of the establishment of a career guidance system,
whose benefits cannot however yet be measured. No progress was made on foreign language
teaching enhancement, as the component was eventually cancelled with no implementation.
While Turkish students’ performance improved significantly between 2003 and 2009, as reflected
by PISA scores, there are clear attribution issues preventing from linking this improvement to
project interventions. Further, no systematic evidence of efficiency gains is available (see
Section 3.3).

Revised PDO (April 7, 2010 – April 30, 2012): To support improvements of conditions for
student learning in secondary education and in schools in sub-provinces with low enrollment
rates.

     Key Performance Indicators                                         Status

                                                                        school grants.


44. Early independent assessments indicate that curricula revised by MoNE were generally
more aligned with international standards, but no follow-up assessment was conducted on
Project-supported curricula revisions. By project closure, 66 curricula in general secondary
education, representing the universe of all secondary education courses, were revised, and 62 of
them were implemented. With respect to vocational secondary education, 1,151 modules were
revised, and 924 of these were implemented, meeting the original target of 1,000 modules. 17
Independent assessments financed under SEP in 2007 and 2008 indicate that four curricula
developed by MoNE outside of the Project scope were generally in line with current international
standards. Specifically, they were found to: (i) offer a clear set of learning objectives and content
enabling the development of students’ knowledge and key competencies; and (ii) support students
in structuring a firm set of values and attitudes necessary for further personal growth and social
insertion. Textbooks designed and published in line with the revised curricula were also found to
be pedagogically sound, to offer a large range of learning opportunities for students, and
sufficient examples of teaching practices to be used in the classroom. At the same time, the
assessments highlighted the fact that despite significant improvement of individual subject
curricula, the country had not developed a national curriculum framework or underlying
philosophy for secondary education that would provide the conceptual and theoretical basis of the
new curricula, outline expected outcomes on students, and ensure cross-curricula coordination
and a common set of cross-curricular objectives. The assessments also recommended increasing
emphasis on monitoring the curriculum implementation process through teachers’ feedback and
student assessments as well as increasing professional development support to teachers for
curriculum implementation. Although extensive teachers’ in-service training was provided and
individual, ad-hoc seminars were conducted to seek feedback on the implementation of the
Geography, Mathematics, Turkish Literature, and Foreign Language curricula, respectively, there
is no evidence that these recommendations were reflected more broadly and on an ongoing basis
in the final years of the project implementation. Further, because no follow-up independent
assessment was conducted after 2008 and because of MoNE’s decision to rely solely on national
consultants, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the totality of curricula revised under the
scope of SEP were aligned to international standards.

45. The School Development Program (SDP) introduced a paradigm shift in Turkey’s
management of school funds, and was made possible by exceptional joint efforts of the
Government and the Bank. With remarkable efforts on the part of MoNE and the Bank teams,


17
   Outside of the Project’s scope, MoNE developed and implemented an additional 6,197 vocational
secondary education modules.

                                                  21
SDP was designed and implemented quickly, and extended twice to expand coverage. By project
closing, Euro 31.8 million were disbursed in school grants for 3,671 projects identified at the
school level, exceeding the original targets. Although beneficiaries were satisfied with some
aspects of the grants, pressure for rapid disbursement contributed to weaknesses in design and
implementation. The SDP featured several positive aspects:

      Eighty percent or more of beneficiaries 18 agreed that SDP funds contributed to
     improving school learning environment. Beneficiaries also generally agreed that SDP
     contributed to several aspects of school life, including a general improvement in school
     environment and in students’ social behavior.

      Although not an explicit objective, an important outcome of the SDP was the capacity
     built at the school and sub-provincial levels in participatory development of school
     plans, and in budgeting, procurement and financial management. The SDP generated
     interaction between Parent Teacher Associations, Non-Governmental Organizations, and
     municipalities that did not exist before the Project.

      By demonstrating the viability of decentralized financing, the SDP is seen to have
     contributed substantially to the ongoing dialogue and planning for education decentralization.

      SDP planning and implementation provided for the first time an opportunity of close
     and regular communication between schools and sub-provincial MoNE Directorates.
     Furthermore, because the SDP grants provided the Directorates with a tool to proactively
     respond to some of the schools’ needs, schools’ confidence towards them was enhanced.

46. At the same time, several other factors limited the Program’s effectiveness:

      Targeting did not always identify the neediest schools. Sub-provinces with less than 90
     percent primary enrollment rates were selected for SDP support. Grants were targeted to all
     primary and secondary schools in these sub-provinces. Of the 3,671 schools that received
     school grants 3,513 were primary and pre-primary schools. This targeting approach was
     based on then existing data and had the advantage of simplifying criteria and administration,
     but not necessarily of reaching the schools with the greatest needs. The additional sub-
     provinces benefitting from the expanded SDP had enrollment rates above 90 percent. MoNE
     also found that the reported enrollment rates were not always accurate, due to unrecorded
     migration of families to other districts and, hence, in some cases the real enrollment rates in
     beneficiary sub-provinces were closer to 100 percent. Also, within sub-provinces, high
     variation was found in schools’ learning conditions and the severity of need.

      Participatory processes and local community decision-making, both innovative
     elements of the SDP, turned out to be more limited than expected. The Beneficiary
     Assessment results suggest that the participatory process and decision-making role of local
     stakeholders was weaker than expected. Participation of students, parents, and local
     community members appears to have been relatively low compared to that of school
     principals, Parent Teacher Associations (PTA), and teachers. More than 80 percent of
     respondents indicated that local community members had no saying in final decisions.




18
  The SDP Beneficiary Assessment sample consisted of 150 beneficiaries in 11 districts and 50 schools;
face-to-face interviews with 73 beneficiaries in 2 districts and 6 schools.

                                                   22
   Although survey results indicated that PTAs had an active decision-making role, fieldwork
   evidence did not support this conclusion.

    Mixed beneficiary satisfaction with the use of grant funds. The Beneficiary Assessment
   indicates that 80 percent of total grant funds were spent for the purchase of equipment,
   namely computers, copying machines, and projectors and for minor school improvements.
   Schools visited as part of the assessment were found to have invested heavily (up to 20-50
   percent of total grant funds) in seminars, special tutorials, publications and materials related
   to improvements of students’ scores in the Seviye Belirleme Sinavi (SBS), a central
   examination used as an entrance exam for secondary schools, administered to 8th grade
   students. While beneficiaries were generally satisfied with the use of grant funds for
   equipment and recreational facilities, study materials and tutoring services for the SBS are
   more controversial. On the one hand, these materials were viewed to create equal
   opportunities for particularly disadvantaged students, but on the other hand they were
   perceived to have little or no contribution towards enhanced student performance. This
   perception is supported by the findings of a study funded under SEP, where stakeholders
   (including administrators, teachers, parents and students) identified weaknesses with the SBS,
   including an excessive focus on test-taking skills, a perception that the test provides only
   partial feedback, and its low contribution to raising the quality of education (see Annex 2).

     Lack of a strong M&E framework and structure from the outset reduced the value of
    the program as a pilot, limiting both the ability to learn from lessons about process and the
    availability of information on the outcomes of school projects. Although the level of
    beneficiaries’ satisfaction is an important indicator, it does not itself provide any
    measurement of the extent to which conditions for student learning were improved. The
    Ministry of Development indicated that at the time of SDP design it had requested that an
    impact assessment be included in the sub-component, to complement the findings of the
    Beneficiary Assessment with more objective data. However, such assessment was never
    incorporated. The Beneficiary Assessment itself points to monitoring deficiencies, such as
    lack of a regular and systematic reporting both at the sub-province and school level, and lack
    of well-functioning community monitoring and accountability mechanisms. The fact that
    SDP financed items such as volleyball and basketball courts and other smaller items that were
    not included in the Loan Agreement list of small civil works seems to suggest MoNE’s own
    difficulty to fully monitor the use of SDP funds.

47. Achievement of the last PDO is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Under the last PDO, the
pace of implementation was positively reversed, resulting in the disbursement of about Euro 62
million in two years and in the achievement of most revised key performance and intermediate
outcome targets. However, due to lack of evidence of improved conditions of student learning -
neither one of the indicators being a sufficiently good measurement of this objective – modest
relevance, and no systematic evidence of efficiency gains (see Section 3.3), this PDO is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

48. Efficiency is rated negligible, based on short evidence of the benefits attributable to the
Project compounded by its long implementation period. At appraisal, the economic
justification of the Project focused on improvements in productivity, competitiveness and equity
of earnings through reform of secondary education. No Internal Rate of Return was estimated.
With the evolution of objectives, components and targets through successive restructurings,
project focus narrowed to improvements in learning conditions in both secondary and primary
schools. The Project’s fragmented and evolving structure, combined with limited evaluation

                                               23
studies, make it difficult to identify benefits directly attributable to the Project or assess impacts
of the investment.

49. The components in initial project design were not well integrated across MoNE departments
and they were implemented in relative isolation, without exploiting potential synergies and
efficiencies across the program. Major sources of inefficiency during implementation included a
lengthy implementation period – 5 years from approval, only 19 percent of allocated funds had
been disbursed – and the time and resources allocated to components and procurements that were
eventually dropped, in particular the large and complex components for foreign language training
and ICT. Cost effectiveness in implementation is obscured by the frequent changes in
components and targets and the lack of information tracking unit costs through project monitoring
and reporting. For example, at a total cost of Euro 32 million, the SDP disbursed grants for some
3,700 school projects. Anecdotal evidence suggests that procurement under these grants was
efficient because incentives were strong at the local level to make the most of the funds. However,
no systematic monitoring or analysis of costs was conducted to support this. Based on comments
in the SDP Beneficiary Assessment report, efficiency of the program may have been compromised
to some extent by deficiencies in training local government and school staff in the new
procedures.

50. From a fiscal perspective, SEP had negligible impact on sector recurrent costs. No new
institutions or school enrollment capacity were created, with the exception of the Career
Information System.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

51. Because of the large amounts disbursed under the last objective, the outcome ratings
weighted in proportion of the share of loan disbursements under each PDO would result in
an overall project rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory. The ICR, however, rates the overall
outcome of the Project Unsatisfactory (see Table 3) for the reasons outlined below. SEP’s
positive contributions include:

    (i) Independent assessments indicating that curricula revised by MoNE were in closer
    alignment with international standards. In addition, the Beneficiary Assessment suggests
    an overall high level of satisfaction with the revised curricula, including positive opinions on
    the possibility to integrate ICT into teaching and learning processes, apply diverse methods,
    and link between teaching and assessment.

    (ii) SDP beneficiaries’ perception of improved school learning environment as a result
    of school grants. Most areas of activity funded through the SDP are perceived to have
    improved schools’ learning environment. More specifically, the Beneficiary Assessment
    suggests that SDP is largely perceived as a tool to overcome physical deficiencies of schools
    and, although to a lesser extent, as having increased the satisfaction of teachers towards their
    working environment and the autonomy of schools in identifying and fulfilling their needs.
    The majority of survey respondents also agreed that the SDP contributed to the improvement
    of students’ social behavior and to their satisfaction with their schools.

52. Notwithstanding these contributions, several factors undermined the overall outcome of the
Project:

    (i) No sufficient and measurable evidence of PDO achievement. While the very limited
    implementation under the first two PDOs resulted in no tangible outcomes, the absence of an
    adequate M&E framework makes it difficult to measure the extent to which the last PDO was

                                                 24
        achieved. Though an increased alignment of revised curricula with international standards
        and beneficiaries’ views on SDP are important indicators, they do not themselves provide any
        objective measurement of the extent to which improved conditions for student learning were
        achieved.
        (ii) Decreasing relevance and outcome-focus of the PDO. As noted earlier, the two Level I
        restructurings resulted in the introduction of large sub-components that altered project design
        and resulted in output-oriented and overly narrow objectives whose relevance was
        significantly reduced (see Section 3.1).

        (iii) Frequent, substantial changes in design and objectives led to a lack of focus and
        effectiveness. SEP’s final design is substantially different from the original one. Over the
        course of implementation, the emphasis of the PDO shifted from improving “quality,
        economic relevance and equity of secondary education to support lifelong learning? to
        supporting “improvements of conditions for student learning in secondary education and in
        schools in sub-provinces with low enrollment rates?. Similarly, the focus of related outcome
        indicators changed from targeting improved student performance, as measured by national
        and international assessments, to curricula being more aligned to international standards.

        (iv) Overall limited contributions to reform. Although SEP originated to support Turkey’s
        secondary education reform, it did not contribute to any significant reforms beyond the
        development of revised curricula. Similarly, although the SDP is seen to have contributed
        substantially to the ongoing dialogue on school decentralization, this remains a medium to
        long-term agenda, with prospects that are difficult to determine at this stage.

        (v) Low efficiency. As noted earlier, design and implementation factors resulted in
        negligible efficiency (see Section 3.3).

      Because project objectives were formally revised, project outcome was assessed against both the original
   and revised objectives. Separate outcome ratings were weighted in proportion of the share of loan
   disbursements made in the periods before and after the approval of the revisions. Outcome ratings comprise
   an assessment of PDOs relevance, extent of PDO achievement, and project efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

53. A social assessment was planned during project preparation, but was never carried out.
However, informal consultations and discussions with stakeholders and beneficiaries, including
focus group discussions with parents, students, teachers, employers, NGOs, community leaders,
and community members took place. The social analysis was also informed by a nearly
simultaneous Labor Market study on Turkey, a Knowledge Economy Assessment, and a Poverty
Assessment. 21

54. SEP did not have any visible poverty, gender, or social development impact, though the
PAD puts great emphasis on social and gender dimensions (see Section 1.4). Equity is also
explicitly addressed in the PAD and was discussed extensively at the Decision Meeting. The 2008
Project Paper also points out that changes proposed for the Project were not expected to have an
impact of the Project's original social aspects. However, project activities did not specifically
target disadvantaged groups, nor were these issues followed through during implementation.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

55. SEP was implemented by a Project Coordination Center that was an integral part of
MoNE and almost entirely staffed by civil servants. In this respect, institutional strengthening
in the areas of project management, procurement, and financial management occurred within
MoNE. At the same time, PCC dismantling at project closing resulted in the dispersion of such
capacity. While experiences of former PCC staff remain within the Government, the cumulative
knowledge and capacity of the PCC as an entity are no longer accessible.
56. Although not an explicit project objective, an important outcome of the SDP was
expected to be the capacity built at the school and sub-provincial levels – in participatory
development of school plans, budgeting, and procurement. However, SDP beneficiaries indicated
that even though the SDP encouraged schools to determine their own needs and develop plans
accordingly, control exercised by MoNE sub-provincial directorates over the tendering process
limited school autonomy and contributed to an overall perception of low transparency. Moreover,
the SDP Beneficiary Assessment found that participation of students and parents in the decision-
making for grant allocation was low, and significantly more so for local community
representatives.22

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

57. No other unintended outcomes and impacts were observed.

Economy Assessment Study, March 2004; World Bank Report 29619-TU Turkey Joint Poverty Assessment
Report, August 2005.
22
   According to the SDP Beneficiary Assessment, PTAs had an active role within mechanisms of decision-
making. According to findings from the fieldwork, however, PTAs were excluded from decision-making
mechanisms.
                                                 26
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

58. No beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshops were conducted as part of the ICR. MoNE
organized a closing conference for the Project in June 2012, and the ICR draws from the
discussions held as part of it.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

59. The risk to the development outcome is rated Substantial. Whether and to what extent
curricula reform and school development grants, through school planning autonomy, contributed
to improved learning conditions cannot be concluded with the evidence available from the SEP
experience. While curricula revisions are likely to be sustained at regular intervals through
government funding, and there are indications that school decentralization has become an
increasingly important item in MoNE’s agenda, the latter remains a contentious topic that will
require high-level political commitment and that will likely not be implemented in the short-run.
As a result of limited evidence on PDO achievement and uncertainties over the future and timing
of school decentralization and financial autonomy in Turkey, the risk to development outcome is
rated Substantial.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

60. Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Unsatisfactory. Although the
original focus of the Project was relevant to Turkey’s context and consistent with the general
priorities outlined in the 8th National Development Plan, several shortcomings at the design stage
significantly limited the effectiveness of the operation: (i) lack of client ownership; (ii) lack of a
well-defined and broadly owned secondary education strategy; (iii) overly ambitious PDO and
results framework; (iv) excessively long and costly project preparation; (v) only partial reflection
of lessons from earlier projects; and (vi) inadequate anticipation of some key risks and relevant
mitigation measures.

(b) Quality of Supervision

61. Bank performance at supervision is rated Unsatisfactory.

62. The ICR recognizes the Bank’s positive contributions to supporting project implementation,
including:

    (i) Contributing to a positive reversal in project performance during the last two years
    of implementation, resulting in the disbursement of 77 percent of loan funds and in the
    achievement of most of the Project’s revised targets. These include: (a) revision of 66
    curricula for general secondary education, and implementation of 62 of them; (b)
    development of 1,151 modules for vocational education and implementation of 924 of them,
    against a target of 1,000; and (c) provision of school grants to 3,671 schools in 60 sub-
    provinces. Notwithstanding the design issues associated with it, the SDP, introduced as part
    of the 2010 restructuring, represented a turning point in establishing greater client ownership
    of the Project, and in improving the pace of disbursements through the use of school grants.

                                                 27
   (ii) Regular supervision of fiduciary aspects by a fully decentralized team. As noted
   earlier, Procurement and Financial Management staff was entirely country-based. This
   allowed a more active involvement of the Bank in the resolution of complex procurement
   issues by assisting MoNE in identifying solutions that were in line with the Bank’s guidelines
   but that would minimize further delays and reputational risks for both the Client and the Bank.

   (iii) Quality and frequency of performance reporting increased over time. A total of 14
   Implementation Status and Results reports (ISR) were prepared throughout the duration of the
   Project. Aside from the first two ISRs, which rated both PDO achievement and
   Implementation Progress as Satisfactory, overall performance ratings were generally realistic
   and agreed by Bank’s sector and country unit management. A mid-term review was planned
   in May 2008 but not formally carried out. Instead, intensive implementation support and
   review missions took place at the time of both Level I restructurings, in early 2008 and 2010.

63. At the same time, a number of aspects, which weighted heavily in the overall project
performance, were not adequately addressed:

   (i) The dialogue with the client focused, in large part, on short-term design adjustments,
   leaving little room to focus on the broader, national priorities for secondary education.
   The two restructurings were thus a missed opportunity for the Bank to recalibrate its support
   and remain relevant to Government policies on secondary education. Instead, the Bank
   focused on addressing short-term agendas that were not in line with national priorities, such
   as the teachers’ foreign language training, or on identifying fast-disbursing activities that
   heavily shifted the focus of the project, such as the School Development Program. In addition,
   reaching consensus on design changes and implementation issues involved long and difficult
   processes. Despite four restructurings and close follow-up in the field, SEP remained a
   Problem Project for 63 out of 82 months, corresponding to 77 percent of the entire
   implementation period. Although underlying issues were at times outside of its direct control,
   the Bank appears to have contributed to some of them. For example, SEP’s first restructuring
   proposal, stemming from MoNE’s request to reallocate a substantial amount of project funds
   to overseas teachers’ training, should have been resolved prior to submitting SEP for
   approval. Instead the Bank, under pressures to deliver the operation within a given fiscal year
   following a long preparation period, appears to have oversimplified the resolution of the issue
   by reassuring MoNE that the activity could have been easily added after approval.

   (ii) Repeated restructurings led to increasingly narrow results frameworks, which were
   much more short-term and output-oriented. Significant scaling-back of M&E throughout
   implementation was a deliberate choice but also one that was dictated by the decreasing time
   available for implementation. Nonetheless, the resulting indicators were output-oriented and
   difficult to measure, thus providing limited information on the Project’s overall results. The
   ability to measure project results was further impaired by the exclusion of virtually all key
   studies and assessments from the original project design, including failing to conduct a
   follow-up independent assessment on an important activity such as curriculum reform.
   Additional implications of this decision were a missed opportunity to support relevant
   capacity and M&E culture in MoNE, and to provide information on the effectiveness of
   different project activities and approaches that would have been of value to MoNE in
   planning future programs.

   (iii) The Bank was not well placed to resist internal and external pressures to proceed
   with project activities that were not grounded in best practice and linked to national
   priorities. For example, despite its technical concerns on the Training for Foreign Language
   Teachers sub-component, the Bank ultimately agreed to include the activity in the Project.

                                              28
    Apart from a compromise reached with MoNE to evaluate the first phase of the training to
    inform the design of the second phase, no new technical evidence or international experiences
    had been brought forward to address the underlying concerns.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

64. Overall Bank performance is rated Unsatisfactory based on the Unsatisfactory rating for
both Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

65. Government performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The rating reflects several
factors, including: (i) the fact that despite a long preparation time, the original Project was
submitted for approval with low ownership on MoNE’s side, and with a lack of a well-defined
and broadly owned secondary education strategy; (ii) a lack of intervention over a progressive
decline in M&E focus following the cancellation of key impact studies and surveys, including a
weak M&E framework for the SDP; and (iii) positive contributions to the project dialogue
throughout implementation on the one hand, but its inability to assist in resolving issues in a
timely manner, resulting in very limited implementation over a five-year period. The rating does
recognize the fact that Bank’s communication on initial design issues was not sufficiently clear
and resulted in the Project being submitted for approval without a full resolution to MoNE’s
requests.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

66. The performance of MoNE and the Project Coordination Center (PCC) is rated
Satisfactory during the last two years of the Project’s life, in recognition of fast
implementation, particularly with respect to the School Development Program, and
Moderately Unsatisfactory overall. The rating recognizes the fact that the Project was prepared
and approved with limited ownership by MoNE, which was initially perceived as being supply-
driven. As is the case for Government performance, the implementing agency rating also
recognizes the fact that the Project was submitted for approval with unresolved design issues, and
without sufficiently clear and transparent communication from the Bank on how to best address
them. MoNE’s overall achievements in secondary education, reflected in increased enrollments,
improved student performance, and reduced performance inequality are also noted (see Figures 1,
2, and 3). At the same time, with respect to the Project, MoNE was found to have contributed to
delays, some of which were the result of weak procurement practices and frequently changing
priorities at the political and decision-making levels. Although Fiduciary capacity fluctuated
throughout implementation, the PCC’s capacity was generally adequate, reporting of project
progress was done through comprehensive and annual progress reports, and the PCC played a
pivotal role in the significant implementation turnaround towards the last stages of
implementation. However, as noted by QAG, the effectiveness of PCC staff was constrained by
weak accountability mechanisms and complex management systems within MoNE, particularly
during the earlier stages. In general, the costly and lengthy design process, weak implementation
reflected in less than 20 percent of loan funds disbursed during the first five years, and a
progressive weakening of the Project Development Objective contribute to an overall Moderately
Unsatisfactory rating.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory based on the Moderately
Unsatisfactory ratings for both Government and Implementing Agency performance.


6. Lessons Learned

General

(i) Ownership of the implementing agency remains the single most important factor in
determining the success of a project. Clearance and support from central Government
agencies are a necessary but not sufficient condition for success. The initial dialogue on
project design appears to have been largely driven by the World Bank, albeit with the support of
Treasury and the Ministry of Development. As a result, SEP was long perceived by MoNE as a
supply-driven project without clear ownership.

(ii) A significantly flawed initial design is difficult and costly to correct during the course of
implementation, despite instruments available to restructure operations. Such tools are best
suited to adjust project designs which are based on solid premises and ownership, which was not
the case for SEP.

(iii) Better understanding and increased awareness of the political economy surrounding a
specific program or operation is likely to positively affect its ultimate outcome. Specific
factors that the Bank should be more attentive to include the differing roles and incentives driving
institutions within the Government and their differing perceptions and rationale for working with
the Bank, as well as a thorough understanding of sector developments and of the national policies
driving them.

(iv) An investment project approach may not be the most effective to support a program’s
roll-out at the national level. Such approach has value-added in piloting new programs or
policies, as was the case in the original project design with respect to curriculum reform, or in
cases where the Government sees value in the Bank’s technical and/or financial support of
national programs. In the case of SEP, when the pilot approach to curriculum reform was no
longer relevant because MoNE had decided to roll-out the program nationwide, the Bank was not
able to support and add sufficient value to MoNE’s scaling-up of its secondary education
programs, aside from the financing of curricula revisions which the Government would have
likely carried out even in the absence of SEP. 23 In such circumstances, the use of a results-based
operation would seem more appropriate.

(v) From a Government perspective, carving out a relevant role for the Bank in a
sophisticated country needs careful discussion of where the Bank’s value-added is, and how
it can be maximized. In the case of SEP, this does not seem to have been the case, with Bank
support being scattered across various and often changing activities, with no evidence that its
technical and international knowledge, or availability of financing instrument options, was used
to maximum effectiveness and efficiency.



23
  Outside of the Project’s scope, MoNE carried out the revision and implementation of about 6,200
vocational secondary education modules, in addition to the 1,151 financed under SEP.

                                                  30
(vi) Assessing the outcomes of project activities should be at the core of each Bank-financed
operation, because of the implications that such findings have on beneficiaries, but also on the
implementing agency and government at large, by providing information on the effectiveness of
different project activities and approaches to inform future policies and programs. In the case of
SEP, attention towards the quality of M&E and the overall outcome-focus of the Project
decreased overtime, hampering the ability to assess the ultimate benefits of most activities on the
beneficiaries.

(vii) Remaining engaged in non-performing operations should be carefully evaluated
against longer-term implications. Decisions to remain engaged in a given sector may provide an
opportunity for the Bank (and the client) to broaden their engagement. However, while in the
short term this approach may pay-off, the medium to long-term implications of extending a non-
performing operation should be carefully evaluated. In the case of SEP, a negative perception
towards Bank procedures has developed at some levels of MoNE, and was cited as one factor
contributing to the Ministry’s decision to limit its engagement with the Bank on the lending front.

School Development Program

(i) The specific needs for improving learning conditions vary greatly between schools and
can best be identified at the local level. At the outset, the SDP Operational Manual specified the
proportion of each grant to be allocated between teaching needs and goods and it precluded some
types of expenditure. After finding in the course of implementation that real priorities varied
greatly between schools, more discretion was given to the school in the revised Operational
Manual for subsequent projects.

(ii) The SDP experience supports the case for decentralization of school financing in Turkey,
which should be high on MoNE’s agenda, but with some important adjustments.

(iii) Better criteria are needed for identifying the schools with the greatest needs. Because of
SDP design, resources were given indistinctly to all schools in a given sub-province, without the
possibility to single-out those with greatest needs.

Vocational Training Initiatives

(i) Strong information and promotion activities are needed to ensure that calls for
proposals reach beyond school administrations and existing project group members. In the
case of VTI, the Beneficiary Assessment found that notifications did not reach all teachers, with
the result that the same group of teachers tended to appear as beneficiaries in all projects and the
opportunity for diversification through the VTI was hence limited.

(ii) To achieve project ownership and capacity development at the school level, strong
support and guidance is needed to schools in developing their own proposals. In the case of
VTI, the Beneficiary Assessment observed that “participation in programs was generally guided
by private companies with experience in project development. Because these companies generally
act as service providers during the implementation phase of projects, they contact schools when a
project call is published and undertake important responsibilities in determining the needs, as well
as development and implementation of project.? This led to problems regarding ownership,
unsuitable content and quality of projects, lack of sustainability, as well as lack of improvement
in the project development capacity of the participating schools.




                                                31
(iii) Stipulating partnerships with sector representatives or NGOs as a requirement in
project proposals is ineffective in promoting such relationships unless the partner’s role and
responsibilities are clarified and monitoring mechanisms are established. The Beneficiary
Assessment found that, except where partnerships already existed, these tended to be treated as a
formality for the sake of the proposal and that the role of partners was not significant.

(iv) Sustainability of project benefits depends on partnership between schools and industry.
VTI beneficiaries highlighted that investments in equipment have great positive value initially,
but this is lost as technology becomes outdated. In this context, they highlighted the importance
of cooperation between school and industry, to provide vocational teachers and students access to
the latest technology.

(v) Incentives and information dissemination are needed to spread the benefits of school
projects beyond the individual institution. Formal evaluation of in-service trainings and
broader recognition for professional development would increase the motivation for participation.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

67. The World Bank welcomes and appreciates the constructive and candid comments provided
by MoNE, MoD, and the Undersecretariat of Treasury, as well as their support throughout the
preparation of the ICR. In recognition of the remarkable efforts of MoNE and the Project
Coordination Center during the last two years of implementation, and in response to comments
received, the Project counterparts’ performance is explicitly recognized as being Satisfactory for
that phase of the Project.

(b) Cofinanciers

68. There was no co-financing with other international financial organizations.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component 24

Component 1: Secondary Education Reform

Sub-component 1.1: Curricula Reform

1. Objective

The objective of this sub-component was to revise and implement new general education and
vocational education curriculum programs to provide students with core skills for the knowledge
economy and lifelong learning. This objective remained unchanged throughout project
implementation. At the time of project approval, primary education curricula and textbooks had
already been revised and introduction of similar changes at the general secondary and vocational
education levels was a high priority.

2. Achievement of the final Intermediate Outcome Indicators

Intermediate Outcome Indicator: Curricula reform (including at least 1000 modules for
vocational education), textbooks, and other educational materials and equipment have been
developed and implemented in general secondary schools and for at least 15 occupations in
vocational education.

• 66 curricula in general secondary education were revised, and 62 of them were implemented;
  1,151 modules were developed, and 924 of them were implemented under 15 areas for
  Vocational Secondary Education institutions, against a target of 1,000.
• About 50 textbooks were finalized by the end of the project, and others were under preparation.
• A number of workshops were organized to coordinate curricula development activities in 10
  pilot provinces. About 20,000 teachers were provided with in-service training for curriculum
  implementation through 186 seminars/workshops (see Table A below).

Sub-component 1.2: Information and Communications Technology (ICT)

1. Objective

The objective of this sub-component was to provide ICT training as a core competency for youth
to function in a modern knowledge economy, to improve the medium of instruction by using ICT,
to expand access to learning opportunities and support better management of learning and
administrative processes.

2. Achievement of the final Intermediate Outcome Indicators

Intermediate Outcome Indicator: Teachers in at least 1,600 secondary education schools that
previously had no ICT equipment use ICT in their classroom teaching.

• ICT equipment worth Euro 5.3 million, namely projectors and photocopiers, was provided to
  1,629 schools. The scope of work under this sub-component was significantly reduced during
  restructuring. Initially, the sub-component targeted installation of 322 ICT classrooms,
  procurement of multi-media software and materials for e-learning, installation of computer
  assisted science labs, monitoring integration of ICT technologies in the classrooms, extension
  of e-learning and in-service training for the use of ICT classrooms. Throughout implementation,
  a large share of the ICT contract envisaged under the Project was cancelled because of outdated
  specifications and differences between national procurement and World Bank procurement
  procedures.


Sub-component 1.3: Career Guidance and Counseling.

1. Objective

The objective of this sub-component was to provide youth and adults with access to career
information and guidance services to promote informed career choices and related education and
training decisions and facilitate lifelong learning. This objective was also part of the original
project design and remained unchanged during implementation.

2. Achievement of Intermediate Results Indicators:

Intermediate Outcome Indicator: New career guidance and counseling system used by at least
300,000 students in secondary education.

• As part of SEP, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with Turkish Employment
  Agency (ISKUR), Ministry of Development, Council of Higher Education and other respective
  institutions.
• In close partnership with these agencies, a new web-based Career Information System (CIS)
  was developed and became operational in April 2010.
• By project closure, the site (http://mbs.meb.gov.tr) had 1.3 million registered users.

Component 2: Quality Assessment

Sub-component 2.1: Student Assessment

1. Objective

The objective was to improve the quality and outcomes of secondary education by developing
systems to collect and disseminate reliable information on student learning and outcomes, and on
the performance of education system staff and institutions.

2. Achievement of the final Intermediate Outcome Indicators

Intermediate Outcome Indicator: Student achievement results reported and shared with
stakeholders and public.

The activities under this the sub-component focused on two areas: (i) piloting of a national
assessment of student outcomes; and (ii) carrying out research in the education sector.

Piloting of Student Achievement Assessment Exam (OBBS)
• SEP supported design of measurement tools for the OBBS, as part of which 13 academicians
  were involved in the review of questions for Turkish Language and Literature, Mathematics,
  Science, Social Sciences and English courses. The new measurement tools were piloted in 20
  schools in Ankara between May 26 and May 30, 2008.
• SEP also supported the piloting of OBBS at the secondary education level. OBBS was launched
  in 2002 under the Bank-financed Basic Education Project, covering primary education.
  Secondary education was included for the first time in 2009 under SEP. The test covered five
  areas: (i) Turkish Language and Literature; (ii) Mathematics; (iii) Natural Science; (iv) Social
  Sciences; and (v) English. The test was piloted on May 28, 2009. It was administered in 300
  schools across Turkey, including 210 general secondary education schools and 90 vocational
  high schools in 30 provinces from 7 regions. A total of 140,000 students from grade 9 and 10
  took the test.
• OBBS assessment results provided a picture of student knowledge and skills across the country.
  The results, however, were published and disseminated only in 2011, after significant delay.
  Dissemination took place through two workshops organized in Ankara in 2011 for Ministry
  representatives, academicians, provincial and sub-provincial staff of the Ministry. The
  following were gathered based on the assessment results: (i) one of the factors influencing
  learning difficulties for grade 9 and 10 students is the weak education received by these
  students in earlier grades; (ii) Females in grade 9 outperform males in Turkish, Social Sciences,
  Sciences and English; but no significant difference was found between male and female
  achievement rates in Math. In grade 10, absolute achievement of female students in Turkish and
  English tests is higher than that of male students.
• MoNE plans to conduct future assessments every three years through new computer-adapted
  tests. Nonetheless, at this stage, the ICR team could not find evidence on the application of
  assessment results for policy-making.

Education sector research
The Project also supported implementation of nine research studies commissioned at the request
of the Educational Research and Development Division (ERDD) of MONE looking at different
aspects of secondary and vocational education. The results of these studies were widely
disseminated and discussed with public in various workshops.



                                                36
• The following studies were carried out:
   (i) 21st Century Student Profile of MONE. The purpose of the research was to obtain
         information to what extent current student characteristics are compatible with the desired
         21st century student profile. The results of the study were disseminated in a workshop
         organized on April 14-15, 2010.
   (ii) Review of Class Applications for Common Grade 9 and Transfers between Schools at
         Secondary Education (vocational and technical education) level. Findings from this
         study suggest that students and parents are not adequately informed about the objective,
         scope and rules of the joint 9th class and school transition practices. The content and
         hours of intensive classroom course were not found suitable given the heavy curriculum
         load in grade 9; the promotion and referral services were also found as not sufficiently
         effective.
   (iii) Expectations of the Sector from Vocational and Technical Education Schools for Girls.
         The objective of this study was to determine whether the education and training in the
         field of food technologies, offered by the schools affiliated with Directorate General of
         Technical Education for Girls, provide students with desired knowledge and skills. The
         findings suggest that professional practice, laboratories and lab equipment, and learning
         materials need to be improved. It was also suggested that teachers who work in the field
         of food technology should have university diploma in the area of food technology
         teaching.
   (iv) Assessment Study on the Relations between Non-governmental Organizations and
         Provincial and Sub-provincial National Education Directorates. According to the study
         results, directors of provincial and district national education directorates have more
         positive views than the directors of NGOs. The main difference was about the use of
         physical facilities of schools and other educational institutions for educational activities.
   (v) Assessment Study on Contribution of the Trade and Tourism Schools Serving the
         Needs. According to the study, teachers and administrators have theoretical knowledge
         but lack practical skills. Graduates and last grade students seem to be satisfied with their
         schools and changes in curricula affect education of students. Nonetheless, departments
         at schools do not meet the need for intermediate labor force of their areas: students are
         facing problems in using tools and equipment at enterprises since the schools are not
         equipped with the latest technological devices; most of the employed graduates are
         working in other fields rather than their own field of specification. Graduates do not meet
         the expectations of the enterprises.
   (vi) Assessment Study on Contribution of Common Cultural Lessons into Vocational and
         Technical Education. The objective of this research was to identify the extent to which
         common courses contribute to vocational and technical education and to present
         suggestions for solutions to raise the level of contribution. According to the research,
         while common courses contribute to general culture and communication skills, they were
         not found to sufficiently support area/branch courses. The research suggested that
         common courses could be formulated more in line with the characteristics of the
         vocational area.
   (vii) Assessment Study on Branch Preferences of Secondary Education Students. The
          objective of the research was to determine the factors that influence secondary schools
          students’ branch preferences. Results revealed that teachers out of branch should not be
          employed in the guide services of the schools and students and their parents should be
          provided with sufficient information about branches and professions. The results of this
          survey reveal the need for students to be encouraged to choose their branches according
          to their interests and capacities by means of an effective guidance.
   (viii) Assessment Study on Level Determination Exam (SBS). This research was intended to
          evaluate the economic, sociological, psychological and physical impacts of SBS as well
          as its overall impact on academic achievement, school achievement and teaching

                                                 37
         processes, and to analyze the contents and structure of SBS and the existing and
         potential models in transition to secondary education. The research found that SBS
         affects families financially by creating increased dependence on extra-school resources
         such as private tutoring schools and private lessons. While students were found more
         eager to study due to SBS, the test is viewed as the source of an exam-focused structure
         in the education system, including teaching methods. Furthermore, the research found
         that SBS results cannot be considered a sufficient indicator of academic achievement,
         and cannot be used for measuring the level of academic qualifications, due its focus on
         instantaneous performance on cognitive learning and basic skills. As a result, the
         majority of respondents suggested that SBS be abolished, and that arrangements be
         made to enable an open admission system in the long term.
    (ix) Evaluation of Secondary Education in terms of Learning Period. The objective of this
         research was to evaluate the implications of raising the duration of secondary education
         to four years for schools, programs, students and parents. While teachers thought that
         increasing the duration of secondary education to four years made limited contributions
         to education, students and parents viewed the four-year secondary education as a change
         that improves the quality of the education process.

Sub component 2.2: School Development

1. Objective

The objective of the School Development sub-component was to help secondary schools improve
their own performance, their students’ educational attainment, and quality in education through
school development activities to be designed and implemented within the school development.

2. Achievement of the final Intermediate Outcome Indicators

Intermediate Outcome Indicator: School development management teams, comprised of
teachers and school administrators, established in all secondary education schools and prepare
school development plans in line with strategic management guidelines.

• The Project supported creation of School Development Management Teams in all secondary
  education schools, and 3,689 primary schools. As part of the process, 15,000 educational staff
  were trained in school plan preparation.
• The Project also supported design of a performance management system to evaluate the
  performance of teachers, school managers and civil servants of MONE. In this regard, the
  General Directorate of the Teacher Training and Education (GDTTE) set out the general field
  proficiencies for secondary-school teachers in general as well as in all special fields, with the
  exception of the occupational and technical fields. In addition, the general field proficiencies
  for managers, together with special field proficiencies of branch managers working in
  provincial organizations and the principals, head teachers and vice-principals of pre-school,
  primary, secondary and occupational/technical educational institutions have been set out by the
  General Directorate of Personnel. Finally, the Inception Board set standards for provincial
  organization branch directorates, preschool, primary, secondary and Occupational/Technical
  educational institutions. SEP supported the piloting of the performance management system in
  education in 14 provinces (Kayseri, Sincan, Kirikkale, Kirsehir, Hatay, Osmaniye, Nigde,
  Bartin, Karabuk, Aksaray, Nevsehir, Yozgat, Bilecik and Bursa) during September and October,
  2011. At the time of this ICR, it is not yet possible to evaluate the outcomes of this sub-
  component. The pilot of the performance evaluation system is still ongoing and has not been
  finalized at the time of the ICR.

Component 3: School Grants

Sub-component 3.2 25: Vocational Training Initiatives

1. Objective

Introduced to the SEP in the 2008 restructuring, this sub-component financed grants to vocational
technical schools on a competitive basis, with the aim of promoting innovation, improving the
quality of vocational secondary programs and their relevance to employment needs. To address
concerns in particular that vocational schools needed to be more responsive to the needs of the
labor market, the program would help improve the quality and economic relevance of vocational
technical education programs by supporting innovative proposals -- by vocational schools in
cooperation with other partners -- to improve the skills and qualifications of vocational teachers
and improve the quality of the vocational training institutions.

2. Achievement of the final Intermediate Outcome Indicators

Intermediate Outcome Indicator: Teacher training skills in selected vocational schools are
adapted to modernized education technologies, teachers start implementing the new training
methods, and teachers and school administrators are satisfied with the use of competitive school
grants.

• Forty-six project proposals were approved and implemented in 33 provinces. Training and
  consultancies accounted for the largest share of disbursements which amounted in total to Euro
  2.7 million.
• Of the allocated budget of Euro 3 million for this sub-component, Euro 2.75 million was
  disbursed, of which 66 percent was for training and consultancy services, 22 percent for “per
  diems? and 12 percent for goods. Teacher training – in foreign language and technical subjects
  – featured prominently.

Sub-component 3.3: School Development Program

1. Objective

The rationale for the School Development Program (SDP), from the March 2010 Restructuring
Paper, was the need to address the adverse impact of the economic crisis on schools in Turkey’s
poorer districts. The objective of the sub-component was to provide grants to schools in sub-
provinces with low enrollment rates in order to provide additional assistance to schools in areas
likely to have been affected adversely by the economic downturn.

2. Achievement of the final Intermediate Outcome Indicators

Intermediate Outcome Indicator: Use of school grants is consistent with the needs identified in
the school development proposals.
• The original target was for SDP to support 2,710 schools in 46 sub-provinces. As a result of the
  popularity of the program and demand from other provinces, the Government requested an



25
   Sub-component 3.1, Training for Foreign Language Teachers, was dropped as part of the April, 2010
restructuring.

                                                  39
  expansion of the program, which eventually benefitted 3,671 schools, of which 158 were
  secondary schools, in 60 sub-provinces.
• A total of Euro 31.8 million was spent under this component, against an original allocation of
  Euro 24 million.


Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation

Sub-component 4.1: Project Implementation Support

1. Objective

The Project Implementation Support sub-component had the objective to support effective
administration and coordination of the Project, including Project execution, managing the
resources of the Project, procuring goods and services under the Project, operating the financial
management system, and ensuring timely and appropriate reporting. This sub-component was
also intended to finance public awareness activities through dissemination of the key messages
and accomplishments of the Project

2. Achievement of the final Intermediate Outcome Indicators

Intermediate Outcome Indicator: No intermediate outcome indicators were formulated
specifically for this sub-component.

• The Project Coordination Center functioned as the administrative and coordinating unit
  throughout the Project, and was instrumental, particularly during the last two years of
  implementation, in ensuring fast implementation of the School Development Program. Under
  its leadership during this phase of the Project, 77 percent of total loan funds were disbursed.
• At project closing, MoNE organized a closing conference for the Project in June 2012, in which
  main lessons were drawn and shared among MoNE central and provincial-level departments
  and directorates, with the participation of consulting companies and academicians involved in
  Project activities.

Sub-component 4.2: Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

1. Objective

The revised objective of the M&E sub-component was to support regular monitoring of the
Project, evaluation of Project sub-components, and an evaluation of the overall impact of the
Project on the quality and relevance of education.

2. Achievement of the final Intermediate Outcome Indicators

Intermediate Outcome Indicator: Key project assessment studies carried out and results
discussed.

• Under the Project, the following Beneficiary Assessments were conducted: (i) Vocational
  Training Initiatives; (ii) Curriculum Reform; and (iii) School Development Program.

• The results of these assessments were discussed within MoNE and with other relevant
  stakeholders. The SDP Beneficiary Assessment was completed in August, 2012 and has, at the
  time of the ICR, only been discussed within MoNE.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

        The limited information on outcomes, combined with the Project’s evolving and
fragmented structure, and the large scale of Turkey’s education sector in relation to the Project,
make it difficult to assess or quantify the benefits of the SEP in relation to costs, or to discern an
overall impact. In the circumstances, an economic analysis is not possible but some relevant
comments are provided here.

Economic rationale

         The economic rationale of the SEP as presented in the PAD was “to better prepare
Turkey’s future workers to participate and compete in an economy that is experiencing rapid
technological change, demanding of higher levels of productivity, and becoming increasingly
knowledge-based.? The reform of secondary education reform was also justified by the need to
narrow the wage gap between different segments of the youth population entering the labor
market. The economic analysis in the PAD endorsed the government’s policy of expanding
access to secondary education and increasing the proportion of secondary pupils in vocational
schools, and assessed some of the policy options for achieving expansion. The original Project
Development Objective was to improve the quality, economic relevance and equity of secondary
education to support lifelong learning. The project design, however, addressed issues related only
to the quality and content of secondary education, not to the access or equity issues. No expected
rate of return was estimated for the project.

        In subsequent restructurings, the objectives shifted first to improving conditions for
student learning in general and vocational secondary schools, and then to improving the
conditions for student learning in primary and secondary schools in sub-provinces with low
enrollment rates. The broader economic rationale under the first Level 1 restructuring was not
made explicit. Under the second major restructuring, at the time of the economic crisis, there was
an explicit equity rationale of targeting schools with low enrollment rates, based on the
assumption that these schools were disproportionately affected by the crisis, but substantiating
data were not provided.

Expected Benefits

         According to the original Results Framework, achievement of the project’s development
objective would be demonstrated through better student and graduate performance and reduced
regional variance in student achievement in the schools benefiting from the project’s
interventions as compared with other schools. While it was probably overly ambitious to expect
the benefits of the new programs to be reflected in national assessments and graduate tracer
studies within the proposed time frame of the project (considering the time needed to develop and
fully implement new curricula and related in-service training, and for graduates to have benefited
from the full four-year program), in the event this was not tested. Project objectives and
indicators were revised through the two restructurings, the new curricula and related project-
financed activities were not focused in selected schools, and no comparison could be made of
results in beneficiary and non-beneficiary schools.

        The expected benefits under the restructured operation – improvements in conditions for
student learning -- were not quantified or related to economic outcomes.

Actual Project Benefits

         As reported in section 3.2 of the ICR, the information available on project achievements
is limited largely to the outputs that were delivered. The most significant were: revision of
general education curricula; revision of vocational education modules; and support to
implementation of the new curricula through textbook development and teacher training; support
to establishment of a career guidance system; trial of student assessment; grants for sub-projects
to improve teaching quality and relevance of vocational school programs; grants for sub-projects
to improve learning conditions in schools in low-enrollment districts; and studies/research to
inform policy. Beneficiary Assessments indicated broad satisfaction of the beneficiaries of the
training and grants as well as approval of the revised curricula. No assessments were available to
provide an indication of the expected educational, economic or social outcomes.

SEP in the Sector Context

        A sector study conducted by the World Bank in 2005 26 identified a number of
weaknesses in Turkey’s secondary education system constraining its effectiveness in supporting
national economic and social development. Only 27 percent of the adult population had a
complete secondary school education, compared with 65 percent in the EU, 74 percent in Korea,
82 percent in Poland, and 87 percent in the US. Unemployment rates for recent graduates were
quite high: more than half of eighth-grade graduates and nearly a quarter of secondary school
graduates were still looking for work in their early twenties. The performance of Turkish students
on international tests was far below the OECD average. Variance in student performance between
regions and schools was particularly high and was reflected in high inequality in the incomes of
school leavers. The Government of Turkey had recognized that an inefficient education sector
was constraining economic growth, competitiveness and social cohesion and responded with its
Eighth Five Year Plan outlining an ambitious collection of national education objectives. Yet the
existing array of laws, programs and actions did not add up to a comprehensive strategy for
achieving these objectives.

         The key challenges for improving equity and efficiency in the sector as well as the
quality and relevance of secondary education programs, as identified in this study and in
subsequent analytical work, 27 included: changing governance and financing arrangements to
increase efficiency and equity in the allocation of public resources; moving from a selection-
based system (which favors students whose families can afford private tutoring for entry exams to
secondary and higher education) to a results or outcome-based model to support lifelong learning;
modernizing general education curricula in line with international standards; increasing the
relevance of vocational training curricula to changing employment needs in the modern sector;
restructuring to facilitate flexible transfer of students between general and vocational tracks;
improving the quality and management of teachers.

        At the time of preparing this ICR, most of the above reform issues remained to be
addressed and a comprehensive national strategy for the sector was still needed. Nevertheless,
Turkey had made significant progress in expanding enrollments (see Figure 3) and in

modernizing basic and – through the SEP -- secondary education curricula. Some headway was
made in strengthening learning outcomes: the 2006 and 2009 PISA results for Turkey pointed to
improvements in student performance and reduction in inequalities (see Figures 1 and 2),
although still well below the OECD average. It is unlikely that the improvements in PISA results
could owe much to SEP, when revised secondary curricula were only very recently being
implemented.

Value added by SEP

        In practice, the SEP picked up several elements of MoNE’s agenda, based on the
respective priorities of different departments, rather than constituting in itself an integrated
approach to meeting a specific objective. SEP funding was not additional to MoNE’s budget and
it can be speculated that, in the absence of Bank funding, most of the items financed by SEP
would have proceeded in similar fashion through other sources of funding. The question arises as
to how much if any value was added by using the World Bank to finance these activities. The
views expressed by MONE officials indicated some instances when SEP-funded activities
benefited from technical inputs and support from the Bank, although this was balanced to a
considerable extent by the costs and difficulties they experienced in meeting the Bank’s reporting
and procurement requirements. The Bank’s input was particularly appreciated in design of the
school grants program (SDP) which was an entirely new approach for Turkey and stimulated new
confidence in the potential viability of decentralized financing of schools.

Efficiency and Cost Effectiveness in Implementation

        The components in initial project design were not well integrated across departments of
MoNE and they were implemented in relative isolation, without exploiting potential synergies
and efficiencies across the program. Major sources of inefficiency during implementation
included lengthy delays – 5 years from approval, only 19 percent of allocated funds had been
disbursed – and the time and resources allocated to components and procurements that were
eventually dropped, in particular the large and complex components for foreign language training
and ICT.
                                                       44
        Cost effectiveness in implementation is obscured by the frequent changes in components
and targets and the lack of information tracking unit costs through project monitoring and
reporting. For example, at a total cost of Euro 32 million, the School Development Program
disbursed grants for some 3,700 school projects. Anecdotal evidence from staff responsible for
implementation suggests that procurement under these grants was efficient because incentives
were strong at the local level to make the most of the funds; however, no systematic monitoring
or analysis of costs was conducted to support this. Based on comments in the assessment report,
efficiency of the program may have been compromised to some extent by deficiencies in training
local government and school staff in the new procedures. Similarly, training and consultancies
accounted for Euro 20.3 million and 26 percent of disbursements (see Table C). According to
MoNE’s Closing Report, about 58,900 teachers and administrators benefitted from in-service
training under SEP, at a unit cost of Euro 283. The Project also utilized 196 consultants (see
Table D), at a unit cost of Euro 18,900 and at a man/month cost of about Euro 2,500. No
information, however, was available from project documents or M&E assessments concerning the
effectiveness or cost effectiveness of these activities, for example compared to in-service training
or consultancy employed by MoNE outside of the Project scope.

        The project had negligible impact on sector recurrent costs. No new institutions were
created by SEP, with the exception of the career guidance system, and the Project did not
contribute to expanding enrollment capacity.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


The following comments from the Ministry of National Education (MONE) and the Ministry of
Development (MoD) on the draft Secondary Education Project ICR were sent by the
Undersecretariat of Treasury via a letter dated December 11, 2012.


                  Ministry of National Education’s (MONE) Comments

The Secondary Education Project ICR (Implementation, Completion and Results) Report (Report
No: ICR00002264) prepared by the World Bank has been submitted to our Ministry for
assessment.

As stated in the Report, the Secondary Education Project, which came into effect on 22 February
2006, was restructured on various dates as required during the implementation phase. In line with
the purpose and objectives identified as a result of these restructuring efforts, the Project
outcomes, indicators, components and activities have also changed. These changes were also
found appropriate by the Word Bank, who provided the Project funding.

The studies carried out in line with the objectives and outcomes redefined after the restructuring
are as follows:
    • Within the scope of the restructuring of secondary education in a way that is sensitive to
         the experiences and interests of students and prioritizes problem-solving and coping in an
         environment of change, a total of 66 curricula, prepared with a structured approach and
         centred on the student, have been developed and put into implementation. Lessons and
         textbooks were prepared in accordance with these new programmes. Trainings were also
         delivered for effective and accurate utilization of the programmes.
    • The classical programmes of the vocational high schools transferred to our Ministry from
         other Ministries (such as Justice Vocational High Schools, Title & Cadastre Vocational
         High Schools, Meteorology Vocational High Schools, Health Vocational High Schools
         and Agricultural Vocational High Schools) were replaced with new education
         programmes (curricula) prepared in a modular format based on qualifications with
         adequate flexibility and sensitivity towards the requirements of labour markets. In this
         scope, around 1150 education modules were prepared along with their corresponding
         booklets.
    • Vocational education fields that were in conformity with, and oriented to endure the
         successful implementation of, the newly developed programmes and modules, and that
         had high socio-economic value in today’s world with good employment opportunities,
         such as aircraft, agriculture, health and justice, were provided with modern devices and
         equipment, hence upgrading the education environments to today’s conditions and
         rendering them capable of meeting the sector’s needs.
    • IT equipment were purchased for 1629 secondary education schools in 50 provinces with
         development priority, in line with our Ministry’s policies to support usage of current
         technologies in education.
    • For the first time in Turkey, a web-based National Vocational Information System (MBS)
         was established, which facilitates access to vocational guidance for individuals of all ages
         and which aims to spread vocational guidance works, support and coordinate the
                                                 52
       vocational guidance efforts of the MoNE, İŞKUR (Turkish Employment Authority) and
       other agencies and organizations, and provide guidance to all individuals above the age of
       13 on their life-long path of development and learning. Various activities were carried out
       to promote the MBS. As of September 2012, the system has 1.7 million registered users.
   •   With the Secondary Education Project, nine nationwide studies, aiming to contribute to
       identifying and developing the Ministry’s education policies, have been carried out –
       such as “MEB’in 21. Yüzyıl Öğrenci Profili? (MONE’s 21st Century Student Profile).
   •   In order to ensure a transparent, measurable, participatory and accountable management
       approach in our Ministry, the qualifications of all students, teachers and administrators of
       all levels were identified along with the standards for their educational institutions, and a
       web-based performance management system was created to enable transition to
       performance-based evaluation and assessment.
   •   Vocational Education Initiatives aimed to expedite the localization process of the system
       by including local vocational education institutions in the implementation of the
       secondary education reform process. In this scope, it was aimed to improve, through
       services procured domestically or from abroad, the competencies of vocational education
       and training institutions in the areas they provide education services, improve the
       vocational qualifications of technical vocational education branch teachers, and thereby
       raise the quality of both institutional and individual vocational education. In this scope, in
       order to improve the quality and economic feasibility of vocational education
       programmes, a competitive Project contest was designed with the purpose of improving
       the quality of vocational education institutions and developing the skills and
       qualifications of vocational courses teachers; from among the 433 projects applying for
       the competition, it was decided to support 46 project proposals that were innovative,
       sustainable and not for commercial profit.
   •   By implementing a grand programme at the national level (School Development
       Programme), it was aimed to increase schooling rates and education quality in
       disadvantaged schools; 3671 schools in 60 districts prepared projects to meet their own
       needs, through which they used grants equal to EUR 31,768 Million.
   •   In order to evaluate the Project, beneficiary evaluation studies were carried out for the
       Curriculum Reform, Vocational Education Initiatives and School Development
       Programme, and the results were shared with relevant agencies and organizations.
   •   In order to increase service quality at all levels in our Ministry, various training activities
       were carried out, workshops were organized and equipment support was provided.

When carrying out the Project activities:
  • The Project was executed in concordance with the Project objectives, aims and
      performance indicators agreed upon in line with the final restructuring.
  • All activities were carried out according to the Bank rules, and all Bank approvals were
      obtained.
  • Activities carried out under the Project were subjected to External Auditing every year,
      and these external audits did not find anything violating the Bank rules. Also, our
      Ministry has always done the internal auditing, supervising and auditing the Project
      activities.



                                                53
    •   The Project management, Project activities and procurement activities were reviewed
        during all mission visits paid on a regular basis by the Bank, and no noteworthy problems
        have ever been expressed in any of the mission reports.
    •   Regarding the expenses, constant communication was maintained with the Zagreb Office
        of the World Bank, and no significant problems were encountered in this area.
    •   Of the total Project funds of EUR80 million, EUR 76.95 million has been used. As stated
        in the ICR report, the fund utilization rate is 96%.
    •    The School Development Programme, introduced with the final restructuring of the
        Project, was successfully implemented in 3671 schools, and contributions were made to
        education and training in our country with the grand programme (please find below the
        comments of a students and parent regarding the SDP)

        Tuğba Ergün – Student, Diyadin, Ağrı: “The physical structure of the school was
        improved, enabling students to have their classes in a healthier environment. With the
        arrival of the electronic goods, the classes became more visual, making the courses
        easier-to-understand for students.?

        Kıyasettin Ekin – Parent, Hınıs, Erzurum: “We are very happy with the work done under
        the SDP; all the needs of the school were met and all lacking items were supplied. It has
        been a very significant success for our students. The new things provided to the schools
        increased our children’s desire to go to the school. We want such projects to continue.?

        In addition, in the evaluation made under F. Results Framework Analysis (a) PDO
        Indicator(s) in the ICR prepared by the Bank, the report includes the following
        statements:

                for Indicator 1: “…generally in line with international standards?
                for indicator 2: “Stakeholders partially satisfied with the use of school grants.?
                for Indicator 3: “The career Information System was launched… At Project
                closing, it counted 1.3 million registered users.?
                for Indicator 4: “Piloting of Student Achievement Assessment Exam at the
                secondary education level completed in May 2009. Dissemination took place in
                2011 for MONE representatives and academicians.?

Taking into consideration the abovementioned activities and explanations, we are of the opinion
that the ICR and evaluations by the Bank are incorrect in the ratings:

                1.  “Moderately Unsatisfactory? as expressed under C. Rating Summary, C.1
                   Performance Rating by ICR Borrower Performance and C.2 Detailed Ratings
                   of Bank and Borrower Performance (by ICR)
                2. “Moderately Unsatisfactory? as expressed under G.Ratings of Project
                   performance in ISRs

Looking at the data and evaluations included under the heading H.Restructuring (if any), it is seen
that there was a great progress in the last two years of the Project, and that 75% of the Project
activities and Project spending were done in the last two years. The assessment for the last two
years is MS. It is our opinion that the ratings fall short since the overall Project is rated as MU
while 75% of the Project activates and financing are rated as MS.



                                                54
Thus, we think it would be appropriate to review OOP’s assessments in the ICR report and revise
them in consideration of Project outputs, loan usages and beneficiary evaluations.


                Ministry of Development (MoD) Comments on the Draft ICR

        As a result of the evaluations made, it is seen that the Project process starting in 2005 is
described in a systematic and objective way in the draft completion report. As known, upon the
request of the Ministry of National Education, various revisions were made within the scope of
said Project. In this line, a new component was added to the Project, which allowed lending
against projects prepared by schools, so as to increase access and education quality in districts
where schooling rates remained under 90%. Then it was identified that some purchases of goods
and educational activities would not be carried out until the Project end. Moreover, it was stated
that problems continued in the purchase of information and communication technologies (ICT)
equipment and that progress was slow in some provinces within the scope of the School
Development Grants (SDG) components, while it was found appropriate to transfer the remaining
2 million Euros to the “Quality Assessment? components so as to ensure that the appropriation
was used fully. In addition, it was evaluated that it would be appropriate to transfer all remaining
funds to the “School Development Grants? component in case the allocated appropriations
remained unspent due to cancelled activities or tenders.

         In addition to the revisions, another point that should be mentioned is that carrying out an
impact analysis to assess the grant outcomes is vital in terms of achieving the Project objectives.
However, as stated in the report, no impact analyses were carried out in the Project. Hence, it has
not been possible to measure the outcomes clearly. Moreover, there is no data showing the ways
in which the ICT equipment provided to the teachers have been used. Additionally, the fact that
the Project activities were adjusted according to the existence of a funding source has prevented
the realization of strategy-based activities. The financial resource-based perception of the Project,
the constant revision of Project components, and the changes in the Project team have created
negative impacts on Project ownership. Despite these adversities, the Project has resulted in
important gains for future projects as also described with meaningful expressions under “Lessons
Learned? in the draft completion report.


                  Undersecretariat of Treasury Comments on the Draft ICR

         We are of the opinion that the rating of the MoNE does not sufficiently take into account
that ‘The Project was submitted for approval with unresolved design issues, and without
sufficiently clear and transparent communication from the Bank on how to best address them.?
The ICR rated MoNE’s performance as moderately unsatisfactory with the justifications
mentioned on page 29, paragraph 66. However, MoNE’s limited ownership was mainly due to the
project design which did not reflect MoNE’s priorities.
