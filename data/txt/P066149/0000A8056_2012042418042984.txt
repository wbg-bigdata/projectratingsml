                         Implementation Status Overview
                         SEP's restructured Project Development Objective is likely to be achieved by the closing of the project, as measured by the two PDO indicators - the curricular reform indicator and
                         the school development program (SDP) grants indicator. The former has been met and the latter will likely be met as soon as the independent beneficiary assessment is available. It
                         is expected that this beneficiary assessment will be available at the time when the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is prepared, thus making it possible to conduct a fuller
                         assessment of the achievement of the PDO. There are however moderate shortcomings in the efficiency with which the PDO is likely to be been achieved, as evidenced by a 23

                         components have improved significantly. For example, by project closing 65 out of 66 secondary education curricula have been revised and implemented in line with international
                         practice. Similarly, the School Development Program has benefited 3690 schools in 60 sub-provinces (against an original target of 2710 schools in 46 sub-provinces) and is likely to
                         achieve positive impact on improving school conditions, pending an independent beneficiary assessment, which is currently underway.

                         Given that a critical source of information to assess the achievement of one of the PDO indicators is not in hand as of the writing of this final ISR, the team errs on the side of caution,
                         and proposes a rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory for PDO performance, with the understanding that this will be revisited and at the time of writing the Implementation Completion
                         Report (ICR) if the results of the independent beneficiary assessment of SDP warrants it.

                         Given that a critical source of information to assess the achievement of one of the PDO indicators is not in hand as of the writing of this final ISR, the team errs on the side of caution,
                         and proposes a rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory for PDO performance, with the understanding that this will be revisited and at ICR if the results of the independent beneficiary
                         assessment of SDP warrants it.
