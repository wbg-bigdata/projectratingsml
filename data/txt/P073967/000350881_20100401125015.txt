F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall project development objective (PDO), as described in PAD, was to have rural
school students benefit from improved access to quality education, as evidenced by
higher achievement scores and completion and transition rates. It further states that "This
objective would be achieved through: (i) professional development of teachers and
principals of rural schools; (ii) improvement in learning conditions of rural schools both
with respect to adequate minimum facilities and provision of basic teaching-learning
materials; (iii) promotion of school- based innovation programs and community
participation; and (iv) improvement of policy making capacity of local and central
education authorities/agencies."


                                                ii
  In the Loan Agreement (LA), the objectives are grouped differently. According to the
LA, "The objectives of the Project are: (i) to provide benefits to rural school students
from improved access (sic!) quality education, as evidenced by higher achievement
scores and completion and transition rates; (ii) to enhance education policy making
capacity; and (iii) to strengthen school-community links." This slight difference in
phrasing the PDO(s) in the LA and PAD was common practice of the Bank back in the
time when the Project was designed. Content-wise, the PDO(s) in the LA and PAD do
not differ.

  This ICR assesses the Project using the list of key performance indicators provided in
the PAD and the Supplemental Letter No. 2 to the LA. Accordingly, project performance
was assessed based on the following six outcome/impact indicators:

  *     Increasing rural students' achievement scores in compulsory education as
evidenced by assessments and examinations by end of school year 2008/09;
  *     Reducing the gap between urban and rural achievement scores in compulsory
education by end of school year 2008/09;
  *     Increasing compulsory education completion rates in rural areas by end of school
year 2008/09;
  *     Reducing the gap between urban and rural completion rates in compulsory
education by end of school year 2008/09;
  *     Increasing transition rates to upper secondary and tertiary education for rural
students by school year 2008/09; and
  *     Reducing the gap between urban and rural transition rates to upper secondary and
tertiary education by end of school year 2008/09.

  The Results Framework established at negotiations remained the same during project
implementation. The only change was made at Mid-Term Review (MTR) to three project
targets for intermediate project outputs. This was due to the severe depreciation of the US
dollar in the early 2000s, as well as because of the increase in commodity prices.
Additionally, during implementation specific numeric targets were set for two of the
outcome indicators, which at design simply stated "increasing rural students achievement
scores" and "reducing the gap" in scores between rural students and the national level.

  The Rural Education Project (REP) had a significant nation-wide impact that goes
beyond rural areas of Romania, as the project name suggests. It contributed to the
improvement of the overall policy making capacity of the Romanian education
authorities and agencies. This is evidenced by the development and application of
national education indicators compatible with international reporting systems, the
utilization of a coherent database structure for informed decision making and the
elaboration of annual national reports on the status of education. In addition, successful
project interventions are already expanded at national level (e.g. mentoring activities,
open distance learning programs). For its National Education Database, the then
Romanian Ministry of Education, Research and Youth, and its Project Management Unit,
were awarded a Good Practice Label 2007 by the European Commission in the category

e-Government, under the topic Efficiency and Effectiveness, Benchmarking. Also, for its
demonstrated impact and the innovative approach, the REP was one of the winning
projects in the World Bank's competition "Improving Lives of People in Europe and
Central Asia" in 2008.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal (country, macroeconomic/sector context and the rational for
Bank's intervention).

Following the 1989 revolution and a decade of transition reforms, at the time of appraisal of the
Rural Education Project (REP) Romania had a long track record of education reforms. REP was
designed as the fourth in a series of World Bank supported education investment projects, which
were the back-bone of a comprehensive large-scale education reform in the country. The key
education reform priorities in the early 1990s were focused on pedagogy and curriculum reform.
Those were in focus of the Bank-supported Education Reform Project - ERP (IBRD 46910)
approved in 1994, followed by the Higher Education Reform Project (IBRD 40960) in 1997 and
the School Rehabilitation Project - SRP (IBRD 42130) in 1998. After restructuring of ERP in
2000, a rural education pilot was funded and it served as the basis for the REP, approved in 2003.

REP was seen as a building block of the wider reform supported by the Romanian CAS. The CAS
(May 2001) recognized the need for further investment in education and placed it on the agenda
of the unfinished structural reforms. Together with the Rural Finance Loan (IBRD 46020) and the
Rural Development Loan, REP (IBRD 46540) was expected to contribute to two out of four CAS
pillars--strengthening community-based development and revitalizing economy in rural areas.

While basic education indicators for Romania were deemed favorable by the then CAS,
inequalities in access to good quality education services between rural and urban areas were too
high. In 2001, Romania already had almost universal access (95 percent) to compulsory education
(grades 1 through 8) but it was lower in rural areas and among some ethnic groups. There were
significant differences in learning outcomes as well. In 2000, only 36 percent of rural students
taking the Capacitate examination at the end of compulsory education scored `very good'
compared to 71 percent of urban students. Rural candidates were eight times more likely to score
`unsatisfactory' in science examination than urban candidates. In addition, school infrastructure
in rural areas was highly dissatisfactory, as evidenced by a beneficiary assessment from 2001.
Long time underinvestment in rural schools, the lack of qualified teachers and high rural poverty
were identified as the key factors for disparities in education indicators between urban and rural
areas.

The Government was resolved to address these disparities by using the REP as a vehicle.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the Project Development Objective was to
have rural schools students benefit from improved access to quality education, as evidenced by
higher achievement scores and completion and transition rates. The PAD further states that this
objective would be achieved through: (i) professional development of teachers and principals of
rural schools; (ii) improvement in learning conditions of rural schools both with respect to
adequate minimum facilities and provision of basic teaching-learning materials; (iii) promotion of
school-based innovation programs and community participation; and (iv) improvement of policy
making capacity of local and central education authorities/agencies.




                                                1
According to the Loan Agreement (LA), project objectives were to provide benefits to rural
school students from improved access to quality education, as evidenced by higher achievement
scores and completion and transition rates; to enhance education policy making capacity; and to
strengthen school-community links.

Whereas the difference in wording is significant where it should be non-existent, the ICR team
concluded that content-wise, the difference was negligible. Further, key performance indicators
were fully aligned to both formulations of the PDO.

The six outcome indicators outlined in the PAD and the Supplemental Letter No. 2 to the Loan
Agreement (LA) are the following:
 Increasing rural students' achievement scores in compulsory education as evidenced by
    assessments and examinations by end of school year 2008/09;
 Reducing the gap between urban and rural achievement scores in compulsory education by
    end of school year 2008/09;
 Increasing compulsory education completion rates in rural areas by end of school year
    2008/09;
 Reducing the gap between urban and rural completion rates in compulsory education by end
    of school year 2008/09;
 Increasing transition rates to upper secondary and tertiary education for rural students by
    school year 2008/09;
 Reducing the gap between urban and rural transition rates to upper secondary and tertiary
    education by end of school year 2008/09.

(b) Intermediate Outcome Indicators
The PAD presents four sets of indicators or a total of 14 indicators, or, which follow the four
Project components: (i) Improve teaching and learning in rural schools (4 indicators); (ii)
Improve school-community partnership (3 indicators); (iii) Strengthen monitoring, Evaluation
and Policy making capacity (3 indicators), and (iv) Strengthen project management capacity (4
indicators).

The number and organization of intermediate outcome indicators remained unchanged during
project implementation although the targets for three of them were revised during the mid-term
review (MTR), in agreement with the client and recorded in the October 2006 Aide Memoire.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

During the REP implementation, the PDO remained the same.


1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The Project was to benefit: (i) rural students in compulsory education (grades 1 through 8,) who
would have more education opportunities and would face less obstacles to expanding their
education opportunities when compared to urban students; (ii) teachers from rural areas who
would have better career development opportunities; (iii) education policy and decision makers at
national and local level who would enhance their knowledge and skills; (iv) independent training

                                               2
providers who would benefit from professional development programs that would create
opportunities for them to offer services in a competitive market; and (v) local authorities and
communities who would benefit from capacity building activities.


1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Improve Teaching and Learning in Rural Schools (US$67.91 million, total
estimated cost)

The Objective of this component was to develop professional competences of rural teachers and
to improve basic education conditions in schools. This component was organized around four
sub-components.

The first sub-component (1.1) aimed at supporting a conceptual and practical change in teaching
critical to student learning. Since rural teachers could not easily attend the traditional in-service
trainings due to distance, the lack of transportation and its high costs, the Project proposed the
school-based approach to teacher training. This sub-component would support the design of such
training, along with the needed equipment, technical assistance and materials to increase
professional competences of rural teachers. A group of mobile mentors would support clusters of
teachers in all rural schools.

The teacher career development sub-component (1.2) was meant to assist 4,000 rural teachers to
obtain formal qualifications through an Open Distance Learning (ODL) program, given that the
majority of unqualified teachers in the Romanian education system were teaching in rural
schools. The ODL program would be designed in close cooperation with Romanian universities
selected across the country. They were supposed to develop a curriculum framework and teaching
materials, as well as the software for distance learning courses. The sub-component would also
pay for the tuition fees for teachers taking the courses, as well as the materials and exams.

Sub-component 1.3 would support sizable investments in providing basic facilities in some of the
most deprived rural schools so they could meet the minimum functioning standards. The intention
was to provide targeted small-scale rehabilitation interventions in four priority areas: (i) water
and sanitation facilities; (ii) heating facilities, (iii) electricity; and (iv) school furniture. The
activities would be guided by the National Education Standards and the Ministry of Education
and Research's inventory of rural schools not meeting those standards. There were 1,500 schools
in the initial list. The schools would be selected based on the severity of school deprivation,
number of students, and level of poverty in the community. This sub-component would be
managed by the same unit that managed the School Rehabilitation Project (SRP), to avoid
duplicating implementation arrangements.

Finally, sub-component 1.4 sought to supply 8,000 primary and 4,000 secondary rural schools
with teaching-learning materials selected by teachers, and educational materials such as booklets,
posters, maps, science equipment, sports materials and others.

Component 2: Improve School-Community Partnership (US$11.93 million, total estimated
cost)

The objective of this component was to empower rural schools and communities in order to
develop a broad collaborative environment supportive of education. This component would
include an outreach and behavior change, communication and sensitization activity through

                                                 3
which schools and communities would be assisted by facilitators in discussing local education
needs and in preparing their own school improvement plans, as well as school improvement
projects. Those would be financed through competitive grants under the School-Community
Grants Program (SCG). Local Education Councils (LECs) would be set up at the level of each
commune, involving the mayor and representatives of schools, local authorities, local firms and
other organizations. They would be involved in managing planned activities and mobilizing
community resources.

The grants would support three categories of sub-projects: (i) Sub-projects promoting students'
participation in the learning process and supporting disadvantaged students; (ii) Sub-projects
supporting the improvement of teachers' performance and; (iii) Sub-projects strengthening
community partnerships, opening the school to the community and providing small repairs to
schools.

The grants would be awarded to all counties although the amount per county would depend on a
county risk index, making higher grant amounts available to those counties with higher risk
indices. Grants would be made available on the condition that local communities provide a
minimum of 10 percent of matching fund per grant either in-kind or as a financial contribution. A
clear but complex selection process was set up to ensure transparency and fairness of grant
distribution. It was expected that at least 2,500 grants of an average value of US$4,000 would be
awarded during the Project life.

Component 3: Strengthen Monitoring, Evaluation and Policy Making Capacity (US$3.34
million, total estimated cost)

The objective of this component was to ensure sustainability of educational reforms by
strengthening the MER's analytical capacity at national and local levels for policy analysis and
formulation, as well as for planning and evaluation. These objectives would be achieved through
establishing the National Education Indicators (NEI) , improving the National Education
Database (NED), and preparing a National Assessment (NA) of Basic Education.

The NEI were supposed to be selected and agreed-upon in order to allow regular monitoring of
the education system performance, as well as monitoring of the status of education indicators
between urban and rural areas. The NED would contain the NEI and make it accessible to the
education stakeholders. As a national electronic education database, the NED would be a main
source of administrative and statistical data on education in Romania, with the accompanying
procedures and protocols for data access.

The Project would also support the design of the national assessment of basic education with a
goal to provide a comprehensive report on the results of the 10 year education reform, and
finance the national assessment for grade 4 in 2003 and 2006. Many other studies were to be
undertaken, including a multi-year school-based longitudinal study.

The Project sought to produce a national annual report on education system performance, as well
as make possible the publishing of the results of Romania's participation in PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS
and 4th grade National Assessment.




                                               4
Component 4: Strengthen Project Management Capacity ($6.56 million, total estimated
cost)

The objective of this component was to provide support to project implementation, including
project monitoring and evaluation and to ensure that all stakeholders and public at large were
informed about the Project. Under this component support was provided to: (i) the work of
implementation units (REP PMU and SR PMU); (ii) project monitoring and evaluation activities;
and (iii) the design and implementation of an information, education and communication strategy
for increasing awareness of different sub-sets of project stakeholders.

1.6 Revised Components: None.

1.7 Other significant changes

While formal revision of project components did not take place, some project activities'
financing allocations were changed. This was a result of the severe US dollar depreciation and
the increase in commodity prices, partly influenced by the fact that Romania joined the European
Union (EU) in January 2007. Because of those, the Bank and GoR agreed on new targets for three
key performance indicators at MTR. The most significant change was made under the School
Rehabilitation sub-component where the funds used after the MTR were directed towards the
preparation of the school rehab designs rather than to civil works. The Government decided to
finance the remaining portion of works from its own budget using designs developed under the
Project.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Sufficiency of background analysis. The Project benefited from an extensive analytical base at the
preparation stage. Several years prior to REP, the OECD prepared the Romania Education
Review (1999) and the Bank issued its Education Policy Note (2002), shortly before project
preparation started. The Project also benefited from a PHRD grant, which financed preparatory
work, including a participatory assessment of the obstacles to school attendance and satisfactory
student achievements in rural areas. Extensive consultations with stakeholders in rural areas
helped filter recommendations from background studies.

In parallel, the MER's concern about the growing inequalities between urban and rural settings
led to the design of a Government program--Program for Educational Development in Rural
Areas (1999). In 2000, the Public Institute of Educational Studies developed a comprehensive
study of rural schools "Rural Education in Romania: Conditions, Issues and Development
Strategies." The results of this study prompted the the GoR and the Bank to agree on reallocation
of US$11.5 million from the then ongoing Education Reform Project to a rural education pilot in
seven Romanian judets (counties). The Impact Evaluation study of this pilot informed the design
of the REP.

Lessons from earlier operations. Project design incorporated important lessons from past projects
such as:




                                                5
        (i) Education reforms needed to focus more on equity issues. Most education reform
        interventions prior to REP strove to improve the quality of education. The entire pre-
        university education was reshaped over a decade and many rural schools did not have
        capacity to keep up the pace with the reform. As a result, the already poor status of rural
        education indicators was worsened compared to the education indicators in urban areas.

        (ii) Education issues in rural areas differed from those in the cities. Poverty in rural areas
        was much higher than in urban areas, and poverty was one of the key factors leading to
        lower enrollment and higher dropout rates in the communes (rural municipalities). The
        situation was further aggravated because poverty did not decline rapidly in the 1990s and
        early 2000s. Prior to REP start, there was evidence that insufficient investment in rural
        school infrastructure, the lack of qualified teachers, low mobility and poor
        communications in rural areas all led to lower quality of education in rural areas.

        (iii) Education reform in rural areas needed a different model in addressing teacher
        professional development. Rural teachers had difficulties in accessing traditional in-
        service trainings due to high distances between schools and teacher training centers
        (traditional teachers' houses), the lack of transportation and the cost of training. For these
        reasons, the school-based teacher training was the advocated solution under REP.

        (iv) Capacity building at local level and strengthening the links between the schools and
        communities increase trust and motivation of stakeholders. The results of the impact
        study undertaken during the Education Reform Project's pilot in seven judets (counties)
        indicated that there was a need for more stakeholder participation in education reform.
        Also, the Social Development Fund APL (IBRD 44340) demonstrated that community
        driven development is effective in Romania.

        (v) Public awareness and education campaigns needed to be well targeted towards
        different audiences. The reforms undertaken prior to REP did not reach all of the
        intended stakeholders, including rural school teachers and principals, parents and
        students. REP design addressed this problem by ensuring that information and
        communication campaign is integrated in the original project design.

The implicit definition of equity used by REP influenced the selection of project activities and the
overall project design. First, the REP was fully focused on differences in student achievements
based on residence, as opposed to individual or household factors influencing inequities within
rural or urban settings. The Romania Country Case Study1 showed that when it comes to
enrollments, rural residence is less important than some other variables: being Roma, being
disabled or extremely poor, having no parent that attended more than primary education, or
coming from a household with a large number of adults or children 0-14 years of age. In this
respect, gender as a variable has no effect. At the time of project preparation, the Government
made a decision to use residence as a primary criterion given the scope of the Project (nation-
wide) and the size of population the Project would affect (all rural students or 46 percent of all
student population of the country). Second, based on selection of key performance indicators, the
Project addresses the need for an improved access to quality education in rural areas for those
students already enrolled in schools. No documented project activity dealt with children out of

school and/or access to education itself, although this problem was discussed during project
preparation2.

Assessment of risks. The overall risk rating in PAD was assessed as substantial. It was recognized
early on that community-focused interventions were not common in the countries dominated by
centralized structures in the past. The team anticipated a resistance to change by bureaucracies at
various levels given the Project's innovative approach and the importance given to
communication and participation. Most of the risks anticipated at start were mitigated during
project implementation and did not represent a threat to project results. However, some of the
early identified risks did cause some of the implementation delays or project funds reallocation,
including delays in getting the counterpart funding and making enough funds available to schools
and local authorities for improvement projects.

The Project's quality at entry was evaluated as satisfactory. One potential shortcoming of
preparation was that the Project Development Objectives were set ambitiously and, at the level of
outcome indicators, it was difficult to anticipate the degree of change of outcome indicators
resulting from project intervention. Already in the PAD, it was noted that the real impact of
project interventions to the key outcome indicators would most likely not be visible at project
closure. In case of intermediate output indicators, a manageable set of adequate indicators was
selected and the Project funded the data collection to make possible regular updates.

The Bank used the REP to promote innovative approaches--from school-based teacher training
and improving teachers' qualifications through Open Distance Learning, to a design of a specific
selection process for acquisition of teaching materials. For the first time, teachers in rural areas
were making choices based on local needs instead of receiving packages of materials selected by
a central institution. Moreover, the REP was the first rural education project in ECA. It was
followed by at least one other education project in the ECA region whose design was inspired by
the REP.

2.2 Implementation

The REP implementation was timely and the Project closed as planned, despite the initial delay of
effectiveness caused by complicated government approval procedures. The original target date for
effectiveness was extended for two months, making it possible for the Parliament to ratify the
loan. Following ratification, another delay was caused by a full month needed to publish this law
in Romania's Official Gazette.

GOR's commitment to implement the Project was stable, regardless of frequent changes in the
Ministry of Education's leadership (seven different ministers in the Ministry over project
implementation period). Also, the REP was not restructured nor was considered a project at risk.
On the contrary, a series of Joint Project Portfolio Reviews qualified the REP as one of the best
performing and best disbursing projects in Romania's WB portfolio.

REP's implementation challenges included ensuring timely availability of the sizable portion of
counterpart funding (one third of the total Project value). Under such circumstances, there were
situations in which project activities were postponed. For instance, the budget allocation planned
for 2004 was much lower than needed--out of expected US$12 million, the Project got

US$5million from the GoR budget. At the time, due to a lower than requested overall budget for
the entire education sector, the then Minister of Education resigned.

The Ministry was efficient in setting up the implementing arrangements for REP. As the
implementing agency of the REP, the Ministry of Education decided to use the Project's
management unit (PMU) of the previously closed WB-financed Higher Education Project, which
took over the REP implementation. This PMU worked together with the separate School
Rehabilitation PMU, which was in charge of the REP component 1.3. It was expected that both
PMUs use the county project implementation units (CPIU), and ensure coordination with the
Ministry's departments and various institutions of the education system participating in REP
(school inspectorates, local authorities, NGOs). This way, the Ministry successfully avoided
duplicating project implementation capacity.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. The Project's monitoring framework was outlined at Project design phase and it
was used almost unchanged for the full six years of project implementation. The Project
Development Objectives were set ambitiously and, at the level of outcome indicators, it was
difficult to anticipate the degree of change of outcome indicators resulting from project
intervention. On the other hand, a manageable set of adequate intermediate output indicators was
selected, and the Project funded the data collection to make possible regular updates.

M&E Implementation and Utilization. Progress towards PDO targets was monitored and recorded
throughout implementation. In addition, project implementation was closely monitored through
the regular semi-annual and annual progress reports prepared by the REP PMU and the School
Rehabilitation PMU. The establishment of the set of National Education Indicators supported by
the Project and the improvements in the design and operation of the electronic National Education
Database substantially contributed to the regularity in monitoring project results. The Project
supported a number of studies, including a three-phased longitudinal study on student
performance and the associated factors, and created a basis for regular production of the National
Report on the Status of Education in Romania that is presented by the Minister of Education to
the Romanian Parliament each fall. In addition, the Project supported Romania's participation in
international student assessments (TIMSS, PISA, PIRLS), as well as the National Assessment for
grade 4. These reports on student achievements were made publicly available.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environment. At appraisal, the Project was categorized as FI (Financial Intermediary Assessment)
under the Bank's Operational Policy 4.01 `Environmental Assessment.'

The Project financed small rehabilitation works to improve school's water, sanitation, electricity
and heating facilities. These, together with the activities under the School-Community Grant
Program, were expected to have a positive effect on the environment since they would improve
public health, living conditions and environmental awareness. No major environmental impact
was anticipated given the small size of the planned investments. Apart from small civil works, no
new structures or works of significant size were envisaged under the Project. The potential
negative environmental impact was expected to be localized or mitigated during construction
stage.




                                                8
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared and it included procedures and
implementing arrangements for ensuring full consideration of environmental safeguards. The
plan included project components, a brief summary of conditions in rural schools, Romanian
environmental regulatory framework, EMP for sub-component 1.3 as well as the Operational
Manual (OM) for grants selection, assessment and monitoring under the Component 2. The EMP
was publicly disclosed in an announcement in a national daily with contact details of Project
Management Unit (PMU) and the county school inspectorates. It was also distributed to the
libraries of the county school inspectorates and posted on the MER's web site.

During project implementation no major environmental issue occurred.There were five
supervision missions to check on the compliance with the agreed environmental procedures and
the safeguards specialist found the situation satisfactory.

Financial Management (FM). The FM system followed the Bank's procedures. The REP was
implemented by the Ministry of Education as an implementing agency, which hired two
experienced PMUs, both having implemented Bank supported projects in the past. This unique
arrangement was a result of a long-time Bank involvement in Romanian education reform and the
Government's decision to use the existing capacities. The exception was made in the case of the
REP's school rehabilitation sub-component, which was managed by a separate unit--School
Rehabilitation PMU (SR PMU). SR PMU was already in charge of managing the ongoing School
Rehabilitation Project and the client made a decision to use the existing SR PMU capacity for the
implementation of a similar component under the REP. For this reason, the Project used two
separate special accounts operated independently by two PMUs, while the Government
contributions were received in two ROL separate accounts opened at the Treasury, Bucharest
branch.

Throughout project implementation, the FM was evaluated consistently as either satisfactory or
highly satisfactory. The Borrower has respected the relevant IBRD loan financial covenants, by
submitting to the WB quarterly financial monitoring reports and annual audit reports in a timely
manner and in a format and content acceptable to the Bank. Audit opinions have been
unqualified (clean) and no significant internal control issues have been mentioned.

Disbursement. The Project cost a total of US$91.88 million or US$0.88 million more than
originally planned. Out of the total project cost, US$30 million was expected to come from the
central government budget and an additional US$1 million from local and country level
authorities. However, local contributions to REP were two times higher than planned at project
design--they reached close to US$2 million.

Procurement. Procurement was carried out according to the procurement guidelines and was
continuously rated as satisfactory. No major issues were reported during project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Sustaining reforms and institutional capacity.
Following the change of administration in the fall of 2009, it is encouraging to see that the new
Romanian Government included a substantial education program in its Government Program for
2009-2012. This education program is based on the Strategy for Education and Research for
Knowledge Society developed by the Presidential Commission for Education and is reflected in
the new draft Education Law submitted to the Parliament. Also, Romania's EU membership


                                                9
makes it eligible to access large funds, some of which will be used to sustain changes initiated
under the REP.

The Government is working towards institutionalization of some of the most valued interventions
under REP. Those include the work of mentors who were supporting teachers in school-based in-
service training. A high turnover of teaching staff in rural schools is one of the factors influencing
more demand for this type of in-service training. The new draft Education Law contains a
provision related to mentoring activity as a part of teachers' professional development program.
With this provision, the Government's effort will be extended beyond rural areas. In fact, using
the REP experience with mentoring, the Ministry has also undertaken a similar program in peri-
urban and urban settings using the EU Structural Funds.

Regarding the Open Distance Learning, Romanian universities are now offering modern Open
Distance Learning programs/ courses developed under REP, and the criteria and methodologies
developed under the Project were adopted by the Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in
Higher Education (ARACIS).

Facilitation of school development planning most likely will not be sustained but the capacity of
rural schools to articulate local needs and raise external funds was significantly increased. This
was demonstrated in the round of grant competition organized by the Ministry of Education when
rural schools demonstrated higher capacity by submitting more and better quality proposals than
the schools not affected by the project. In addition, during project life the School Administration
Councils were legislated and will continue to provide support to schools.

The government commitment to school rehabilitation across the country continues to be firm. The
results of civil works under the SR component will remain in beneficiary schools and those
undoubtedly changed the state of public health in those schools. Plus, the designs for utility
upgrades are available to more schools. Although in most schools the quality of civil works under
REP was evaluated as very good, in some schools this was not the case. About 1 percent of all
schools which benefited from small civil works/ utility upgrades had to deal with somewhat lower
quality of civil works. Fortunately, the Bank team's original recommendation that all schools
have to have protective clauses ensuring repairs within a two-year guarantee period, original
problems in schools experiencing problems was successfully overcome.

The capacity for data collection, significantly improved by the REP, may be threatened with
project closure. The school-level operators of the NED will continue to exist, as those are made
up of education sector employees with working hours allocated for this specific task. The
capacity for maintenance and operation of the database as well as capacity to use data will,
however, need more support in the time to come. So far operated by an external consulting
company, the NED will need to be serviced from the government budget, either by its own
employees or by some other outsourced capacity.

Next phase/follow-up operation. Following Romania's membership in the EU, the country
became eligible for the fairly generous European Structural Funds. This alternative source
somewhat reduced the demand for Bank funding in the education sector. Romania is currently
using the EU Structural Funds to extend the work on mentorship schemes/ school-based in-
service training to the urban areas of the country. A project for continuing the qualification of
teachers through ODL will also be financed using the EU Structural Funds. Under the Bank-
supported Social Inclusion Project (IBRD 48250), access to education services by Roma is being
addressed as a component of the wider project led by the Ministry of Social Policy. The Bank's
attention in assisting education reforms in Romania shifted to the support to setting up the student

                                                 10
loan program and the reform of education financing with a prospective introduction of a per
student financing scheme.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The REP was designed at the Romanian Government's request for Bank assistance in its efforts
to reduce inequities in education. By the time of REP preparation, public awareness about the
situation in rural areas was already high. The then Ministry of Education and Research, the public
Institute of Education Studies, a well-known education NGO, Education 2000+, school
inspectorates and others had been involved in a national debate about how to improve education
in rural areas of Romania.

Prior to REP, several governmental programs did try to address the same set of issues in the
education sector but on a smaller scale. No other donor was available to provide the financial and
technical resources for an intervention at the needed scale, and the Romanian Government was
interested in benefiting from the Bank's support, including its value added--the global
knowledge base.

As a result of the GoR's long-term commitment to education reform in Romania, the REP was
included in the Bank's lending program for FY03 under both the low and the high case CAS
scenario. Both the CAS preceding the REP and the one covering the period of REP preparation
and implementation put education reform high on its agenda. In the CAS approved in May 2001,
together with the Rural Finance Loan and the Rural Development Loan, the REP was expected to
contribute to two out of four CAS pillars--strengthening community-based development and
revitalizing the economy in rural areas.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

A set of six PDO indicators and fourteen Intermediate Outcome Indicators were designed to
monitor progress towards the achievement of the PDO (for intermediate outcome indicators, see
Annex 2). On the basis of the available data, the ICR team rates the Project as satisfactory in
terms of achieving its Development Outcome. The PDO indicators are discussed below.

PDO Indicator 1: Increasing rural students' achievement scores in compulsory education as
evidenced by assessments and examinations by end of school year 2008/09. (EXCEEDED)

During the six years of REP project implementation, the Romanian education system reformed its
national examination at the end of compulsory education (Capacitate), which led to the need to
retrofit the value of this outcome indicator--to allow for comparisons across years. By and large,
the value of this indicator exceeded its intended target of having 4.5 percent of students achieving
the highest scores at national examination at the end of 8th grade. By 2008/09, 10.68 percent of
8th grade rural students were achieving the highest scores at the national examination.

PDO Indicator 2: Reducing the gap between urban and rural achievement scores in compulsory
education by end of school year 2008/09. (EXCEEDED)

The Project sought to reduce the gap between urban and rural student performance at national
examinations as measured by percentage of students achieving `good and very good' (7-10).


                                                11
Whereas in 2001/2002, that gap was 16.5%, by project closing the gap had been reduced to 10.89
percent of rural students, compared to the target of 15.5 percent.

PDO Indicator 3: Increasing compulsory education completion rates in rural areas by end of
school year 2008/09. (ACHIEVED)

Reporting on completion rates in Romania is distorted by the fact that the length of compulsory
education was extended from 8 to 10 years as of the school year 2003/043. For this reason, the
indicators in the Data Sheet are presenting the end of 8th grade completion rates and not the
completion rates at the end of compulsory education. According to the data of the Institute of
National Statistics, completion rates for 8th grade for children of 15 years of age were 86 percent
in the school year 2003/04. By 2008/09, this indicator increased to 86.8 percent of children
completing 8th grade. However, Romanian professional community believes that the completion
rates are higher than recorded because of the ongoing administrative practice by which the
children migrating and joining their parents abroad are not correctly recorded as transferred but
rather as drop outs. This creates a challenge in assessing the progress against this indicator.

PDO Indicator 4: Reducing the gap between urban and rural completion rates in compulsory
education by end of school year 2008/09. (ACHIEVED)

As in the case of indicator 3, this indicator was affected by the legislative change related to the
extension of compulsory schooling from 8 to 10 years. In the school year 2003/04, 88.8 percent
of students completed lower secondary education in urban vs. 86 percent of students in rural
areas, accounting for a 2.8 percent gap in completion rates between urban and rural students. In
2007/08, the data show the decrease of the gap (1.4 percent), with 88.2 percent of urban students
completing 8th grade of schooling, compared to 86.8 percent of rural students.

PDO Indicator 5: Increasing transition rates to upper secondary and tertiary education for rural
students by school year 2008/09. (FULLY ACHIEVED)

Indicators 5 and 6 were also affected by the legislative change extending the length of
compulsory education. It is, however, highly likely that this legal change was a significant factor
contributing to the recorded increase of transition rates in Romania. Namely, the data on
transition rates to 9th grade of education/upper secondary education were at 85.5 percent for rural
students in the school year 2003/04. A significant increase was recorded in 2008/09 where 99.4
percent of rural students continued education after completion of the 8th grade.

PDO Indicator 6: Reducing the gap between urban and rural transition rates to upper secondary
and tertiary education by end of school year 2008/09. (EXCEEDED)

As mentioned above, according to the Institute for National Statistics, transition rates for rural
and urban students have changed significantly over the Project's implementing period. In 2003/04
more urban students were continuing education beyond the grade 8th (98.5 percent), as opposed to
85.5 percent of students in rural areas; the difference between urban and rural students was at
12.7 percent. However, in the school year 2008/09, the gap between urban and rural students was

grade 9th than urban students (97.9 percent) in Romania.

Link between PDO and Intermediate Outcome Indicators and Data Availability

While there is no doubt that the REP significantly contributed to advancement of education status
in rural areas Romania, it is difficult to assess the degree of change in PDO indicators resulting
specifically from project interventions (as discussed in the section 2.3)4. Already in the PAD, it
was noted that the real impact of project interventions to the key outcome indicators would most
likely not be visible at project closure. This assumption did not prove right especially in the case
of the outcome indicators 1 and 2, which show significant improvements. The remaining outcome
indicators have significant limitations in interpretation. For instance, in the case of completion
rates, the extension of the length of compulsory education somewhat distorted the prospects of
comparison over time although comparisons across years is possible for completion rates for the
grade 8th..

The underlying assumption of the REP's results framework was that the improvement of key
education inputs would result in achieving the PDO. The Project components and the associated
outputs are directly linked to the stated PDO--more precisely, to the structure of project
components derived from the REP's PDO. However, much of the Project success is not captured
by the agreed outcome indicators. For instance, the curriculum and teaching material, developed
for distance learning program under REP, are used at teacher colleges in Romania. This way, the
initial training of teachers is also affected, not only teachers in-service training. The same holds
true for the increased involvement of local authorities in school life and enhanced cooperation
between them. This is illustrated by the higher level of investment in grant-supported projects
than expected, which local authorities made available to the schools. The status of public health
in schools also improved thanks to the school rehabilitation subcomponent. Both students and
teachers in schools benefiting from utility upgrades spend time in safer environment--with
improved water supply, toilets, heating systems and electricity.

For more details on intermediate outcome indicators, see Annex 2.

   For its demonstrated impact achieved and the innovative character of the intervention, the
    REP was one of the winning projects in the World Bank's competition "Improving the Lives
    of People in Europe and Central Asia" in 2008.
   The REP-supported NED won the Good Practice Label 2007, awarded by the European
    Commission in the area of E-government.

3.3 Efficiency

No economic rate of return was calculated for this project.




4
  For instance, we have no means of knowing the degree to which the teacher training raised student scores.
We know that the REP trained 86 percent of rural teachers and that there are 10.68 percent of rural students
with marks 9-10 in the national examination of grade 8 in 2008/09. While teacher training may have
contributed to a higher percentage of rural students with highest marks (at project start, there were only 2.4
percent of students achieving this result), we cannot state with certainty that teacher training led to these
results as many other factors not influenced by the Project could have also contributed to this outcome.

                                                     13
While improving the efficiency of spending was not a stated objective of the Project, the Project
probably contributed to more efficient spending by enhancing learning outcomes, completion and
transition rates into upper secondary and tertiary education. It proved difficult, however, to
quantify the benefits relative to the costs. As presented in the above section, the REP influenced
the increase in completion rates for Romanian children in primary education. For any
government, a high level of school drop outs is costly - poverty is highly correlated with the low
education status and, as a rule, the lower qualifications, the higher prospects of unemployment.
By actively reducing school dropout rates and by increasing the number of children who continue
education from primary to secondary and tertiary education (transition rates), the Government
increased efficiency in the education sector.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory.

The REP project objectives were highly relevant for the Romanian education reform process and
the Project achieved its stated PDO. The ICR team is aware of limitations in attributing the
achieved level of PDO indicators to REP interventions alone. While, indeed, we cannot
demonstrate that the PDOs were achieved only through the REP project interventions, the Project
had a strong monitoring and evaluation tool in place, i.e. the three-phased longitudinal study that
confirmed the Project's positive impact based on a complex evaluation methodology applied on a
sample basis.

With this in mind, the ICR team is rating the Project as satisfactory for the following additional
reasons: apart from the documented status of PDO indicators, the REP contributed to the
improvement of education quality in rural areas; at the same time, this project was strongly
owned by the client--where the local contribution was two times higher than planned at project
design. Moreover, the client is continuing to work on project supported interventions through a
series of Government programs already supported by the EU Structural Funds. Finally, the REP is
one of the best implemented projects in Romania's WB portfolio; its impact was recognized by
the Bank and the EC, which both awarded this project for its innovative and positive impact in the
education sector in Romania.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The REP is a poverty-targeted intervention with the key aim of reducing the gap in education
outcomes between rural and urban areas of Romania. By succeeding to increase the student
achievement scores, the completion and transition rates of rural students, the Project is likely to
have a substantial poverty-reduction impact in mid to long run.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development)
The Project increased institutional capacity of the Romanian education system for data collection
and management. The Project helped produce a functioning National Education Database and it
set up a network of school-level NED operators who are regularly supplying the school level data
into the database. The identified set of National Education Indicators is a basis for regular
monitoring and reporting about the status of education in Romania. However, sustainability of the
use of data for policy making purposes will most likely be a challenge in the future.



                                                14
In terms of local-level capacities, the REP increased capacity of local-level actors to address
education challenges. As a result of the REP efforts to build Local Education Councils and use
them as a link between schools and local communities, during project implementation, the School
Administration Councils were legislated and are now present in all schools in Romania. Also, the
capacity of rural schools to produce project proposals and compete for external funds is much
higher as a result of the Project5. The links between the schools and communities are much
stronger and there is a higher level of involvement of local authorities and other stakeholders in
the schools' lives.

Project management capacity of the Ministry of Education was increased and it is currently used
for all externally-funded projects in the education sector in Romania, particularly EU-funded
projects. The REP PMU was transformed into a Ministry Unit (the Management Unit for
Externally Funded Projects) with clear placement in its organizational scheme.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative).
The REP-supported distance learning (DL) program, its standards and methodologies for
teachers' training were designed in cooperation with Romanian public universities. The Distance
Learning coursework is accredited by the Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Higher
Education and, independently from REP, used also by the National Center for In-Service Teacher
Training.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

Although the Project successfully delivered on the set project development objective, the
challenge of sustaining the achieved will remain. Continued government engagement and
resources are needed if the discrepancy in rural and urban areas is to be further reduced or even
preserved at the same level in terms of education outcomes. Both the Bank team and the
Government recognize that the work is not finished.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory
Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry was evaluated as satisfactory. Project selection was
in line with CAS priorities and was based on an extensive sector work and the OECD country
education review. The task team fully integrated lessons learnt from the previous Bank-supported
projects, held extensive stakeholder participation, and built on the experience of the two well-
performing PMUs.

  Within the only round of national competition for the Program of Grants for School Development,
organized by the MERY in 2007, rural school demonstrated good capacity for creating grant-winning
project proposals. Also, the rural schools previously involved in the School-Community Program under
REP were more successful in accessing the grant funds than the rural schools that did not take part in this
Program.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory
The quality of Bank's supervision of REP was evaluated as satisfactory. Bank's supervision of
the Project was done regularly (twice a year) with procurement, financial and technical specialists
brought in to help with the supervision work. The Project implementation/ activity plans were
regularly produced and the Bank was proactive in helping the client address the implementation
challenges. The team's interventions at critical points of project implementation were made with
an honest assessment of risks and opportunities both when those were communicated to the
management and to the client.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.
The overall Bank performance for REP is evaluated as satisfactory on the basis of: (i) project
preparation based on solid sector analysis; (ii) good use of past experiences and incorporation of
lessons learned from past operations; (iii) participatory preparation process with significant
stakeholder consultation; (iv) regular and well-staffed missions; (v) pro-activity in addressing
problems; and (vi) open and honest communications with client and Bank management.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall, the performance of the Government of Romania was satisfactory in implementing the
REP--despite many government changes and challenges to secure timely counterpart funds. The
Project was designed with the then Ministry of Education and Research, a strong champion of the
Project with the commitment to devote one third of its own resources towards the REP objectives.

Despite the shortcomings, the ICR team recognizes the continuous effort and commitment of the
Ministry of Education to ensure implementation of a complex and demanding project in times of
numerous political changes. The REP was implemented within its planned time frame, it used the
entire loan amount towards the defined project development objectives, and it was implemented
by the Project implementing units that became departments in the Ministry's organizational
scheme.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Project was managed by the Ministry of Education through the two experienced Project
Management Units (both fully staffed soon after Project effectiveness), and the County Project
Implementation Units located within the county level School Inspectorates. Highly motivated and
skilled staff of the REP PMU and SR PMU ensured the overall coordination of the activities
implemented under REP both with the stakeholders internal to the public education system and
those outside of it. The two PMUs demonstrated their ability to undertake fiduciary work all
throughout implementation without any problems.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall, over the six-year implementing period, the Borrower's performance is rated as
satisfactory. This is based on the Borrower's ability to manage a complex project in a timely
manner and to achieve the Project objectives. This assessment also acknowledges the value of
contribution to project implementation made by the REP PMU and the SR PMU.

                                                16
6. Lessons Learned

The REP's implementation generated a set of lessons for future Bank operations. Some of those
are linked to the wider context of such a complex project design and implementation, while others
are more specific and relate to the knowledge acquired through project implementation. They are
presented as follows:

Stakeholder participation in project preparation and implementation is critical to achieving
community-level impact. First stakeholder consultations were undertaken early in project
preparation when the Bank team solicited views of the key education stakeholders, including
school teachers and principals, parents and students. An extensive public campaign during project
implementation was aimed at both informing stakeholders about the opportunities available under
the Project, and its results. The Project succeeded in creating stronger links between schools and
local stakeholders, including local authorities. The clear evidence of local ownership is two times
higher level of counterpart funding allocated to school-level projects by local stakeholders than
expected at project design.

Education sector ability to generate good quality data is invaluable in increasing awareness
about the problems and transparency in resolving the problems in education. The Project
supported numerous studies and student assessments, including the production of a three-phased
longitudinal study on student performance and the associated factors, participation of Romania in
PISA, TIMSS and PIRLS, as well as the National Assessment for grade 4. It also produced a set
of studies addressing local level issues and produced the valuable NED and NEI. By making the
results of these available to general public, it contributed to a healthier public debate about the
education reform directions. Throughout project life, regular monitoring and reporting was a
practice within the country.

Equity-targeted interventions may have stronger impact if individual and household
characteristics of students are made an explicit part of project design. The REP's focus on
disparities in education indicators between urban and rural areas in Romania was justifiable at the
time of project design, as all the available assessments pointed at this specific problem. The intra-
county inequalities were not made an explicit part of project design although poverty assessment
showed the influence of other factors to the poor learning outcomes. Those include being
extremely poor, being Roma, being disabled, speaking Romanian as a second language; all these
are currently being addressed under the Social Inclusion Project, and should be taken into account
in future efforts to reduce disparities in learning outcomes across the country.

A model of school-based teacher professional development is beneficial in smaller communities
distant from main urban centers. A mobile network of mentors that are carrying out the in-service
teacher training and career development support is both cheaper and more effective for small
rural schools, which are far away from traditional teacher training centers. The in-house support
to teachers and principals contributes to the improvement of teaching and learning but also leads
to the improvement in school atmosphere.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

     (a) Borrower/implementing agencies
The Borrower's contribution is included in the Annex 7. The key dissent between the Bank's
assessment of the Project and the Borrower is the rating, which the Borrower considers highly
satisfactory.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Improve Teaching and Learning in Rural Schools
The Objective of this component was to develop professional competences of rural teachers and
to improve basic education conditions in schools.

Under the school-based teachers' professional development sub-component, the REP supported
the design of teachers training and supplied the needed equipment, technical assistance, and
training materials. The Project trained 146 mentors, who operated across 41 judets. They were
providing training and career development support to the clusters of teachers in rural schools, and
acted as mobile resource centers using the cars procured under the Project. The mentors could be
easily `redeployed' per need and funds available, and a full ` Mentors' Toolkit' is an additional
resource for the education system that is at hand. Also, the Project funded another 463 fixed
resource centers with all information and communication equipment.

Under the sub-component for career development opportunities for teachers, the REP supported a
design of the Distance Learning Program for primary school teachers (classroom teachers) and
subject teachers in lower secondary schools. These professional conversion programs comprised
of courses accredited by the mandated national Agency and designed in cooperation with 7
selected public universities across Romania. 200 new textbooks with DL coursework were
created for this purpose. Over 90 percent of all teachers who started the DL program, completed
it. About 3,000 teachers obtained new professional qualifications. The learning process was
supported by university-based tutors assigned to each rural teacher taking the DL course. The
REP also covered for the cost of tuition fees for all participating rural teachers. See
www.rural.edu.ro/index.php/articles/45

Both the ODL and the mentoring programs were presented at international conferences organized
by the European Commission--RURALEARN- Lifelong Learning for Rural Europe in Greece in
June 2007.

Under the sub-component addressing the basic education conditions in schools, the REP made a
sizable investment in rehabilitation and refurbishing of the most deprived rural schools so they
could meet the minimum functioning standards of the country. The targeted interventions
covered: (i) the upgrade of water and toilet facilities; (ii) of heating facilities, (iii) lighting/
electricity; and (iv) school furniture. The Project supplied 1,467 schools with new school
furniture (benches, chairs and blackboards), 428 schools benefited from new installations for
running water, out of which 352 schools also upgraded its other facilities (heating, electricity and
toilets); in total, 1,385 schools benefited from the design for rehabilitation investments. In parallel
and as a part of the same effort, local authorities financed the purchase of boiler houses for
heating installations. The GoR financed works in additional 833 schools based on the designs
financed by the Project.

The teaching-learning materials sub-component made possible acquisition of teaching materials
that were not renewed in most of the rural schools for several decades. The REP funded the
purchase of books for primary and lower secondary education for 8,000 schools in 33 counties
(where those participating in the ERP pilot were not included). The books were purchased after
the fairs were organized so that the teachers and principals can get acquainted about different
options for books to be used in classrooms. It was for the first time that Romanian teachers could
choose themselves those books they believed were most appropriate for their students. This was
one of the most innovative aspects of the REP project, along with the mentoring program and the

                                                  20
OLD program. Also, about 1.2 million books were provided to school libraries for all rural
schools with grades 5-8; 2.5 million books, 2 million posters, 130,000 wall maps, 7,800 globes,
53,000 balls, 14,000 mattresses, 4,260 chronometers were also distributed. About 8,000 schools
received scientific kits and multimedia labs were established with about 2,300 video projectors,
1,875 laptops and 1,725 video cameras. In every county, the County School Inspectorates
received the materials and distributed it to schools through its warehouses.

The acquisition of teaching and learning materials was a major success for the Project and one of
the best news for the schools. For instance, the number of libraries in rural schools doubled--
there are now 30 percent of rural schools with libraries today, as opposed to 15 percent at project
start.

Component 2: Improve School-Community Partnership
The objective of this component was to empower rural schools and communities in order to
develop a broad collaborative environment supportive of education.

The Project supported the process of facilitation of the school development planning process in
6,964 schools within four rounds of school competitions. The schools submitted 4,130 school
project proposals out of which 4,095 were deemed eligible for a selection procedure, implying
that the quality of submitted proposals was satisfactory. In total, 1,537 schools received grants
and implemented school-level projects in the value of about US$8.3 million.

This component had a positive effect on school atmosphere and collaboration both within the
school and between schools and communities. As noticed by the representatives of the British
Council and the Education 2000+ during the meeting with the author of this ICR, the facilitation
process supported by REP increased school capacity to raise external fund and implement a
school-level project. While there is still a need for facilitation process, a starting point for future
support to the schools is now different.

Local stakeholders generously supported implementation of school level grants by allocating
close to US$2 million in form of either matching funds or in-kind contributions. This is a two
times higher level of local contribution than expected at the Project design. It can be also
interpreted as an indicator of local stakeholders' ownership of the school-community partnership
process.

In an effort to establish an institutional link with local authorities, the REP supported creation of
Local Education Councils (LEC). However, during project implementation (in 2004), the new
School Administration Councils were formed and those replaced the LECs. By law, every school
is obliged to have a SAC consisting of representatives of school staff, parents and local
authorities. The original plan to support three categories of grant-funded sub-projects was
followed and the grants supported 535 sub-projects from the first category, 993 sub-projects from
the third, and 9 from the second sub-project category. The low number of sub-projects in the
second category can be explained by the parallel set of activities to assist teachers, also
undertaken under the REP.

Component 3: Strengthen Monitoring, Evaluation and Policy Making Capacity
The overall objective of this component was to ensure sustainability of educational reforms by
strengthening the MER's analytical capacity at national and local levels for policy analysis and
formulation, as well as for planning and evaluation.



                                                  21
Under REP, the set of National Education Indicators (NEI) was formulated following a
comparative study of international indicators, including OECD, EUROSTAT, UNESCO,
European Commission's Standing Group on Indicators, and WB's indicators, and an analysis of
their applicability to the Romanian education system. A set of 34 `core' NEI indicators are used
for annual reporting on the status of the education system. These reports are available at
www.edu.ro/index.php/articles/c483

The REP also supported the redesign of the previous education database, now known as National
Education Database (NED). It provides administrative data about 9,000 schools (legal entities)
and about 24,000 education units across Romania. The administration of this database was
assured by the externally hired consulting company, which was contracted until December 2007
and continues to provide on-call support for free. The Romanian NED won the Good Practice
Label 2007, awarded by the European Commission in the area of E-government. See
www.epractice.eu/cases/NED. See also the school map with extensive information on Romanian
schools: http://harta.edu.ro/

Thanks to this project, Romania succeeded in undertaking the National Assessment of students in
grade 4th in May 2005. Consecutive assessments were undertaken by the Ministry outside of the
Project. The REP also funded Romania's participation in international student assessments, such
as PIRLS in 2005 and PISA in 2006. The Project supported the analysis of the results of TIMSS
in 2004. Romania continued to participate in PISA and TIMSS without using project funds.

With project funding, a longitudinal study on student performance and factors influencing student
performance was carried out in three phases on a sample of 142 schools, and three separate
studies were produced focusing on issues specific to rural education.

Component 4: Strengthen Project Management Capacity
The objective of this component was to provide support to project implementation, including
project monitoring and evaluation, and to ensure that all stakeholders and the public at large are
informed about the Project. Under this component, an experienced PMU of the previously closed
Higher Education Project took over the work on REP implementation. Together with the SR
PMU, and the county project implementation units (CPIU), the REP PMU ensured general
coordination with the MER's departments and various institutions of the education system
participating in REP (school inspectorates, local authorities, NGOs). Over the course of the
Project, it became a Ministry Department reporting to the State Secretary for Pre-University
Education. Its new role is to manage all externally funded projects within the Romania's MERI.

                              Final Evaluation Project Report - summary

      In the context of the changes that have characterized the Romanian society in the last
decade and a half, educational reforms occupy a special place: their dynamics and scope
surpassed most of the sectoral reforms, benefiting from significant mobilization of human and
financial resource. The Rural Education Project was considered a priority and a timely solution in
place for the difficulties that existed in this area, a project that was addressed to a sector that had
never been specifically addressed.
      The Rural Education Project is an example of best practice with a great impact for the rural
area, for creating equal opportunities, a project that flagged the reform in the rural area and was
sustained all the time by the Romanian Government.

Design of Rural education project:
      The PHRD grant in value of US$462,540 has been the starting point in the design of Rural
Education Project out of which US$402,199 was spent.
      Student achievements in 2002 were much lower in rural schools than in urban areas. More
than half of the students from rural areas were rated at the national examination for ending
compulsory education (Math and Romanian language) with marks less than 6 (on 1 to 10 scale),
compared with less than one third in urban areas.
      The proposed Rural Education Project was built on the earlier achievements of the
Education Reform Project and the Rural Education Pilot in 8 counties (US$11.5 mil) and aimed
to support activities for a major, country-wide education operation in rural areas.
      Perceived causes of problems in rural education were: insufficient resources, equipment
and supplies, unqualified teachers, improper conditions for learning, old school buildings not
maintained without basic conditions.

Diploma for graduating teachers
     The PMU and the National Center for In-service Teacher Training established a certifying
mechanism for delivering to the graduates of the mentoring activity the formal diploma for 30
professional credits.
Accreditation
    The mentoring activity is structured into 3 stages and types of training:
     Activities with the mentor  direct training, basically at cluster level: 28 hours divided
        into: Input (3 days), Follow up (2 days)  the follow up stage will take place after most of
        the participants have completed half of the classroom applications
     Individual and/ or joint planning  pair/ group work at school level : 16 hours
     Classroom application and reflection  individual work at classroom level: 52 hours
      On the basis of these 96 hours of training and mentoring, after accreditation rural teachers
have received 30 credits needed in order to progress in their careers, in accordance to the Ministry
of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (MERYS) requirements.

Sub-Component 1.2: Career Development Opportunities for Teachers

Development of the distance learning DL study programs
Several steps were followed in order to set up a national DL program for unqualified teachers:
(i) A team of external consultants and local experts have designed the guidelines for the DL
      program, DL educational materials design, have developed the DL courses, adapted to the
      printed form. The total number of consultants hired is 171 and the number of modules
      developed is of about 208.
(ii) For each domain a model course was first of all developed, by the subject chair, which was
      submitted to evaluation by potential beneficiaries. The model course was used by the rest of
      authors as referential.
(iii) Each module was accepted only after successful evaluation in what it concerns the scientific
      content and the degree of compliance with distance education technology, performed by the
      subject chair and, respectively, by the expert in DL. Most modules needed several revisions
      in order to comply with the established criteria.

Promotion of the learning programs and submission of applications
      In order to ensure participation in the training programs, the promotion of the learning
programs have started in November 2004, that is one year before the training started.
      A leaflet was elaborated and was made available on the web page of the program and
transmitted through CPIUs in all rural schools. About 3,500 expressions of interest were received
from rural schools teachers who were intending to join the training programs. About 3,700
teachers subscribed.

Selection of implementation institutions and accreditation of training programs
      In order to underline the national character of the study programs they were approved by a
Ministerial Order based on an application submitted by universities. The training programs for
teachers for primary education were implemented by universities who previously received
accreditation from the relevant bodies.



DL programs implementation

                                                29
      The Universities selected (7) to deliver the training adopted the curriculum and the courses
designed by the teams of individual consultants, within REP.
      The responsibilities of universities, which are implied by a quality delivery of DL training
programs, are stipulated in the contracts concluded with the PMU, and were as follows:
      Organizing the submission process, registering the participants, evaluating and making
     available the necessary academic staff, distributing the learning materials, assuring the
     secretarial activity, on-line information and support points for students, establishing a
     system of quality assurance.
     The implementation started in the academic year 2005 / 2006 with a first series of students.
Using additional funds obtained for this activity, taking into consideration the need existing in the
system, a second admission was organized in 2007. Consequently, 1360 have graduated in 2007
(3/4 semesters), 1205 in 2008 (6 semesters and 470 in 2009 (3/4 semesters), which makes a total
of 3035 graduates.
     The drop-out rate, for students that actually have participated at courses, is very low, under 5
percent, and generally motivated by medical or family reasons.

Sub-Component 1.3: Basic Education Conditions in Schools
Design and Works:
       The Project supported the design of rehabilitation interventions for 1,385 schools. One
contract for a sanitary group standard design (awarded through IC procedure) was signed and the
documentation was endorsed by the technical department of SUNRPMU (SRPMU).
       428 school units were provided with water facilities (under 16 contracts awarded through
NCB procedure). 352 schools also benefitted from upgraded heating, electricity and sanitary
facilities.
       During Project implementation, SUNRPMU (SRPMU) delivered furniture for 1,467
schools benefiting 155,000 students and their teachers.
       The Government financed works in 833 more schools using the designs developed under
the Project.

Sub-component 1.4. Provision of teaching-learning materials to schools
Lower secondary education reading materials
       Following the invitation of the REPMU in January 2004 toward the publishers, 66
publishing houses and distributors have submitted offers. A committee of 30 teachers has selected
1,542 books, atlases, dictionaries and other reading materials corresponding to the curriculum, out
of 4,250 proposed titles. The catalogue circulated in all schools in rural areas within the 33
participant counties. In the period September-October 2004, PMU and CPIUs within Teachers'
House have organized county exhibitions for lower secondary education with all books available
in the catalogue. 4,259 schools from the rural area, involving 396,855 students in the lower
secondary education, have received an allocation in order to procure reading materials for the
above mentioned teaching level. After centralizing the orders from all the schools, 56 contracts
were signed with suppliers for 1,053,584 books. These books were delivered to County School
Inspectorates warehouses until middle of October 2005 and distributed to schools until the end of
December 2005.
Primary education reading materials
       Under the same procedure the primary education reading materials were procured in 2007.
       The schools presented the orders in the limit of the allocated budget; they were centralized,
resulting in 39 contracts with publishing houses. The books were delivered at the warehouses of
the county school inspectorates until the middle of December 2007 and in schools in the first
couple of months 2008.

                                                 30
Teaching learning materials
      In May 2005, all the schools from the rural area of the counties which were not endowed
during the Rural Education Pilot Project of 2001, have received a list with teaching learning
materials (other than books) composed of 4 types for primary education (posters, wall maps,
educational materials for integrated teaching of sciences and educational games) and 6 types of
materials for lower secondary education (posters, wall maps and globes, educational materials for
integrated teaching of sciences, models, educational games and sport equipments).
      Based on this list, the needs and characteristic priorities, each school involved has ordered
those basic materials needed for a normal educational activity. The orders of more than 8,500
schools were centralized at the county level and then at national level.
      Based on the schools' orders, all the materials were procured by International Competitive
Bidding as follows:
     Stage 1. Posters, wall maps and globes,
     Stage 2. Sport equipment,
     Stage 3. Kits for sciences and models,
     Stage 4. Kits for physics.
      Considering the economy of scale resulted from the procurement of the teaching  learning
materials, it was also possible to endow a multimedia laboratory for 2,030 schools with video
projectors and projection screens, multifunctionals, laptops and video cameras.

Component II - Improve school - community partnerships

     During the life of the School Community Grants program, about 1,537 grants were financed
using positive discriminatory criteria. Positive discriminatory criteria were required to ensure that
more proportional SCG resources were allocated on a yearly basis to the county showing
significant acute rural school inequity issues.
I.     Design and Implementation of the Facilitation Process
       The training materials and modules were elaborated based on the Operational Manual and
the Applicants' Guidelines that the PMU placed at the TA's disposal. Also, these materials and
modules were designed and aimed to develop specific competencies of facilitators, evaluators,
SACs and STPs members. The Consultant has designed a useful resource material: the
"Facilitators' Kit";
       By the end of the Project, a total number of 6,964 of schools were involved in the
facilitation process.
II.   Submission and evaluation process of the application forms for proposals
      The body of 82 evaluators that was created within the Project included two types of
specialists: an economist and an expert in education.
    The evaluation process was organized in several stages:
    9 Stage 1: conformity checking
    9 Stage 2: the proposals were declared eligible or not
    9 Stage 3: cross-cutting evaluation of the eligible proposals. The minimum score that must
         be obtained in order to be financed was 70 points.
    9 Stage 4: approval of the County Commission for Education, Innovation and Development
         (CEID)
    9 Stage 5: based on the list received from CEID, PMU issued the Ministry's Order.
    9 Stage 6: sign the grant agreements between PMU and the grants' beneficiaries (schools).
      During the life of the Project, almost 4,130 grants' proposals were submitted.




                                                 31
III.  Implementation of awarded grants
      The grants were developed based on the Grant Agreement signed between PMU and each
school that was awarded with grant.
      According to the grants' agreement, the PMU released an advance of 60 percent from the
amount of the grant and 40 percent was released based on the intermediary report developed by
the grants' beneficiaries and approved by the CPIUs' representatives.

Community involvement
       There are clear signs that the school-community partnership improved, not only regarding
the communication between parents/local authorities and schools but also regarding their
involvement within the educational process, in addition to the financial contribution (cash/in
kind) to the subproject.
       There are communities that reacted very well to the grants' implementation since in some
cases local authorities increased the amount of money they contributed (most of the times the
local contribution was increased by up to 50 percent from the total amount of grant).
       During the life of the Project, a total number of 1,537 grants were implemented in four
rounds of competition.
       During the grants' implementation, the local contribution exceeded the minimum 10
percent from the total grant; compared to US$1 million estimated at the beginning of the
Project, the final local contribution amounted to US$1.99 mil (cash/in kind).

Component III Strengthen monitoring, evaluation and policy- making capacity
1. National Education Indicators (NEI) System
       Comparative study "Indicators for Education and Professional Training" comparing the
various systems of indicators, particularly those frequently used in international analyses (World
Education Indicators, Education for All, European Statistics, ETF Key Indicators, OECD, World
Bank, EU Quality Indicators for LLL etc.)
       Manual for implementing the National Education Indicators system -The NEI system
manual includes the comprehensive list of indicators for education (100) covering not only the
specific education field, but also the professional training and the long life learning field. Out of
these 100 indicators, a set of 34 indicators ("core indicators") are prioritized specifically for the
education system in order to be used for annually data reporting and diagnosis of the education
system.
       The NEI system was officially launched by organizing a press conference in May 2005. An
official protocol for collaboration was signed between the MERYS and the National Institute of
Statistics.
       Indicators for the quality of education at school level were also established.
2. National Education Database (NED)
      The activities carried out by the Local Consultant refer mainly to system analysis and
software applications development and installation of the software applications and start-up
assistance, as follows:
       Development of data collection tool software application which collects data about
      schools infrastructure, financial procedures, schools network, students, teachers,
      administrative personnel.
       Development of NEI software application aimed to implement various and complete
      analysis based on NEI system.
       Development of NED software application, mainly aimed to ensure the upgrading of
      current database structure with capabilities for storing consistent and accurate data.
       Development of Public Web software application, including the "school map" (access to
      http://rural.edu.ro/harta/index.html).

                                                 32
     All these specific software application have been delivered to the REPMU and to MERYS,
as well, being successfully installed to the MERYS's Data Center (MERYS central and county
nodes).
3. National Assessment of Basic Education

3.1. PISA, PIRLS, TIMSS  2005 and 2006
       International students assessments like PISA (coordinated by OECD) and PIRLS
(coordinated by IEA) in which Romania is participating (Field Trials in 2005 and Main Studies in
2006) have standardized procedures for preparing and administering evaluation instruments. The
evaluation instruments related to these studies are externally administered on representative
samples at the national level: about 50 schools and about 1,500 students for each study in Field
Trials; about 200 schools and about 5,000 students for each study in Main Studies.
       As far as the TIMSS study is concerned, the National Report has been published and
distributed to the MERYS, WB mission, county inspectorates and school representatives (the
evaluation instruments for TIMSS Main Study had been already administered and data analyzed
by that time - 2004).
3.2. National Assessment of Students Achievement in Grade 4 - 2004
       The National Assessment in grade 4 is aimed to evaluate basic students' skills and abilities
at the end of primary education - first cycle of compulsory education - in order to get a valid
diagnosis of students' performance and curriculum impact on the education system. The national
assessment is sample-based and the target is the school population in grade 4. The students were
tested in three subjects: Mother Tongue (Romanian Language), Mathematics, and Sciences.
        The National Report was published at the end of May 2005 and sent to the policy makers.
Based on the analyzed data, the results reflect the 4 graders level of performance and evaluation
standards level of attainment at the end of primary education.
3.3. Local studies' preparation and implementation
       Three Local Studies contracted by the PMU have been developed on the three major issues
which the education system faces, namely:
   (i) the early school leaving in the Romanian education system ;
   (ii) the factors which influence the students' performance at the school level;
   (iii) the transition and the completion rates by education levels.
       The results of the research and the correlated conclusions have been disseminated through a
half day workshop, with the participation of national and local representatives of the decision
makers in December 2008.

Monitoring & Evaluation System
Project monitoring and evaluation system  design phase
      The methodology and specific data collection instruments for project monitoring and
evaluation system were designed and published in May, 2006.
      The main M&E activities for which the contracted Consultant designed the methodology
and appropriate data collection instruments refer to:
       a)         the annual review of the Project's performance.
       b)         the annual data on project indicators.
       c)         the longitudinal study on student performance and school-level variables.
Project monitoring and evaluation system  implementation phase
Longitudinal studies on student performance and school-level variables (3 longitudinal studies 
baseline, mid-term and final study)


                                                33
      The Project's indicators for monitoring and evaluating the Project's activities and results
were tracked through longitudinal studies of a representative sample of schools, which are formal
research studies, externally developed based on the specific methodology and instruments
mentioned above.
      The longitudinal studies included data on other variables that may influence student
outcomes. The longitudinal study also included data on beneficiary assessment.
      The representative sample proposed for the research consisted of 142 schools from rural
areas already nominated in the above mentioned Methodology, from 39 counties of the country.
      The first longitudinal study on the student performance, in the same time the Project
baseline study, was published in March 2006 and was followed by other two longitudinal studies,
(Mid-Term and Final Longitudinal Study) in 2007 and, in 2009, respectively, in order to assess
project outcomes progress and the impact of project interventions.
Conclusions of the longitudinal studies
       The Final Longitudinal Study (2009) provided valuable information for all factors involved
in the decision-making process and in the administration at national and local levels, offering not
only a diagnosis on the educational system at this moment, but also a starting point for
comparisons with the data included in The First Longitudinal Study (baseline study of the
Project) and an operative and efficient feedback focused on the results and products of all
activities undertaken under all the Project's components.
Annual review of the Project's performance
       The PMU instituted an annual structured, overall management review of Project
performance, as internal evaluation and monitoring instrument. The aim of the review was to
assess how the Project has performed during the previous year in all areas across all components.
       For the field visits, in each county, every year, the PMU, in co-operation with the
monitored CPIU's staff, has chosen 2-3 schools in a non-representative sample, according to the
selection criteria stipulated in the methodology of the Project monitoring and evaluation system.
Using the data collected at the school level by applying specific data collection instruments
(questionnaires for teachers, students, local community's representatives, focus-group with
teachers and parents, interviews with the school's head teacher etc.). The PMU finalized at the
end of each project's year, the Annual Review Report, adding conclusions and recommendations
in order to ensure the Project sustainability at the local level. The reports (2005, 2006, 2007,
2008) represented a valuable tool for PMU internal project monitoring, aimed to demonstrate the
efficiency of the activities' implementation for all project's components.

3.4. Project Management Units
       Within the MERYS, the overall responsibility for managing the Project was placed with a
national executing body (PMU) and its county offices (CPIUs). The PMU is the institution
assuming general coordination responsibilities, accountable for procurement, financial
management and reporting, as well as monitoring and evaluation activities. The PMU is the
institution representing the executing agency's ownership and authority over the Project,
responsible for achieving its objectives and accountable to MERYS for the proper and effective
use of Project resources. The PMU creates an interface for the coordination of the project with
MERYS and its local correspondents and ensures that all Government inputs committed to it are
made available. The PMU was responsible for all centralized procurements except for
procurements under sub-component 1.3. The PMU through CPIUs supervised and assisted the
procurement under grants in component 2. The procurements were made in accordance with the
Procurement Guidelines (paragraph 3.15 - Community Participation in Procurement) and the
Operational Manual Procurement Handbook for SCGP-financed projects (Procurement
Handbook).

                                                34
       The School Rehabilitation (SR) PMU, a unit experienced in conducting similar activities
under the School Rehabilitation project, implemented the Basic Education Conditions sub-
component (1.3). The SR PMU was responsible for: Evaluation of investments for each school
on the MERYS list; Procurement of designs; organizing consultations with local stakeholders on
the proposed designs; procurement of works based on standard biding documents that included
detailed designs; general monitoring of progress of works; and monitoring and tracking of
financial transactions.

Sustainability
Sub-component 1.1: School-Based Teachers Professional Development
      As a sustainable action MERYS developed a project that continues and expands the
mentoring program, the "Professional development of professors through mentoring activities"
for 29,000 professors within an amount of US$6 million over 3 years (2009-2012).
      In this project the same institutions and actors that implemented the school based mentoring
program under the REP are involved: PMU, mentors, technical assistance (CEDU 2000+).
Sub-component 1.2: Career Development Opportunities for Teachers
      The "Distance learning Introductory Course" and ,,Guide for elaboration of distance
learning study materials" were revised and printed, and will be used in the training programs
organized by ARACIS (Romanian Agency for Assuring Quality in Preuniversitary Education).
      The REP language profession conversion programs were also selected to be included in the
"European Profile for the Language Teacher Education  A Frame of Reference" report to the
European Commission, as example of best practice. Other European countries could in this way
benefit from the experience accumulated within REP, and eventually transfer it to their
educational systems.
      The PMU has applied and obtained funds for continuing the study programs elaborated by
REP from the Sector Operational Program for Human Resources Development, within the
European Social Fund. The study programs will be improved, based on the experience
accumulated during the implementation of the REP; 1,000 teachers will be trained both from rural
and urban areas, in different postgraduate specializations, as well as 100 teachers from higher
education institutions, on distance education technology, within an amount of 6 million US$ over
3 years period (2010-2013).
Component 2: Improve School-Community Partnerships
       MERYS launched a national round of competition having as objective to build capacity for
project design and implementation in schools (which was an indirect outcome of the Component
II). Even if the schools didn't benefit from facilitation activities, almost 2,300 projects proposals
were submitted at the first round of competition's deadline. A number of 938 project proposals,
out of 2,414 submitted projects proposals, were from rural schools. After the evaluation process
(regional evaluation), a number of 583 schools (urban and rural) were awarded grants. From the
total number of projects awarded (583), 204 rural schools received financing. Annually, there will
be rounds of competitions organized with funds from the budget for competitions among schools.
Component 3:
      The following cycle of international studies PISA, PIRLS and TIMSS (2007/2009) and the
national evaluation at grade 4 (2007/2008) have been financed from the MERYS budget and
implemented by specific institutions subordinated to the MERYS, following the same design and
procedures as previous exercises described above. They become a common activity budgeted,
administered, used as specific tool for the educational strategy by MERYS.


                                                 35
      We need to emphasize that it is for the fifth time after its development, when the National
Education Indicators (NEI) system has been used in the preparation of the Annual Report of the
Education System Status, presented by the minister to the Parliament (November, 2009) and
posted on the official MERYS website for public consultation. This action shows once again the
integration of Project's activities and products in MERYS policy in terms of strategies, diagnosis,
quality assurance system etc.
Component 4:
       Given their experience on project management, both PMUs are currently implementing
other projects with different foreign donors: World Bank, Development Bank of European
Council, European Union, etc.; each unit is implementing at least 4 or 5 different projects
utilizing the resourced raised.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT
