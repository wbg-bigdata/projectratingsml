INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE PHILIPPINES.
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent
of $12.7 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for
development of technical and vocational education and for improvement in
curriculum development and teacher training.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
the Philippines" (EAP-30a dated May 10, 1972) was circulated to the
Executive Directors on May 17, 1972. Since this report appeared,
the Central Luzon area has suffered one of the worst floods of the century,
and President Marcos has imposed martial law.
3.        The Philippine Constitution gives the President the power to
declare martial law if there is imminent danger of insurrection. The
President has announced that he will undertake sweeping social and
economic reforms in the country and at this stage there appears to be
considerable public support for his action.  However, this support may
dwindle unless these reforms are implemented quickly. It is not clear
how long martial law will last. The Constitutional Convention, which
recently voted for a parliamentary system of government, has continued
to meet and a referendum on a new Constitution could be held early next
year. The President has begun to promulgate as decrees a number of bills
which had been awaiting Congressional approval including the customs and
tariff bill and the government reorganization bill. The Government expects
the former to increase revenues substantially. The latter could improve
the quality of public administration, including economic planning, and
project execution. It should also reinforce the efforts of the able group
of administrators that have been brought into the top levels of public
service in the past two years.
4.        The Philippine economy has grown at an average rate of about
6 percent during the past decade. The ratio of gross fixed capital
formation to GNP rose from an average of about 13 percent during 1960-62
to about 20 percent during 1968-70 and the marginal saving rate was
around 20 percent. However, despite the inpressive growth in total
investment, public infrastructure and agricultural investments were
relatively neglected. Public investment constitutes only 10 percent of
total investment. Moreover, little headway was made in strengthening the



-2-
balance of payments during the decade and large external borrowings were
needed to finance current account deficits, especially in the latter
half of the decade.   Much of this borrowing took the form of suppliers'
credits and short- and medium-term loans to the Central Bank.   The
Philippine economy thus faced a serious foreign exchange crisis at the
end of 1969 which was aggravated by a large fiscal deficit.   The
stabilization program adopted in February 1970 consisted of measures
aimed at reducing excessive liquidity in the economy and limiting the
growth of short-term external debt.   A floating rate of exchange for
the peso was adopted and import restrictions liberalized. During the
last two and a half years the Government has followed a fairly strict
fiscal and monetary discipline.   Although these measures slowed down
output growth at first, econom#ic activity recovered somewhat in 1971
with GNP growth estimated at 6.5 percent in real terms.   This occurred
despite the inflation set off by the 1970 devaluation and sustained by
a shortfall in rice production which resulted in a rice deficit for the
first time since 1967.   Management of the external accounts has also
improved, especially by instituting comprehensive external debt controls.
However, a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade since early 197n,
combined with the rice deficit, has made it difficult to strengthen the
balance of payments position.
5.       The floods in July, which caused extensive damage, made the
economic situation'in the Philippines more difficult.   Public
infrastructure, in particular, roads, flood control dikes, irrigation
works and schools, have been damaged.   A recent Bank reconnaissance
mission estimated that rehabilitation of infrastructure together with
flood control needs'would cost about $125 million.   Because of the
extensive damage to the rice crop, the Philippines' rice imports will
double to 500,000 to 600,000 tons in FY 1972/73.   This will further
strain the balance of payments.   Together with production losses and
damage to private property, the total cost of the flood damage was
estimated at about $200 million.
6.       The administrative, fiscal and monetary reforms that the Marcos
administration has begun to implement under martial law could lead to
improved economic performance in the Philippines in the years ahead.
Progress, however, will depend on how successfully the Government tackles
the difficult and inter-related problems of (a) effective use 'of
investment resources, (b) balance of payments management, and (c) employment
creation and income distribution.
7.       Capital formation in the Philippines is quite high, and the
problem will be to ensure that investment outlays are more effective in
future.   This would involve better use of industrial capacity than was
achieved during the sixties and sharply accelerated public development
outlays if bottlenecks in production are to be avoided and if the
deterioration in social services is to be reversed.   Tne floods have
made it more urgent to accelerate public investment spending which has



been stagnating for nearly two years. Larger infrastructure spending is
needed not only to rehabilitate damaged facilities but also to create job
opportunities for rural families who have suffered a serious loss of
income. If the minimum rehabilitation needs are to be met while maintain-
ing spending levels already programmed for major projects in roads, ports,
power and rural electrification, the infrastructure program would have
to rise to 1,500 million during FY73, from an actual spending of p762
million in FY72. This will present a major challenge.
8.        Substantial additional taxation will be needed to finance the
proposed public investment program. Notwithstanding a much improved
fiscal position in FY1970/71 public savings accounted for little over
1 percent of GNP and were only 5-6 percent of the fairly sizeable total
domestic savings. A disappointing level of tax revenues is at the root
of the problem. The need for a much greater public sector development
effort becomes even clearer in the light of the need to regain
momentum in foodgrain production and to distribute the benefits of
development more widely. But even with greater emphasis on rural
development, the present rate of open unemployment of 7.5 percent is
unlikely to be reduced over the seventies.
9.        The most urgent problem facing the Philippine economyn, however,
is the management of a very difficult balance of payments position. The
most important factor in the tight foreign exchange situation is the
level of external debt repayments. While the total size of medium- and
long-term debt at $1.8 billion does not exceed 15 months' foreign exchange
earnings, nearly two thirds of this debt falls due within the next four
years. Debt service payments, which amount to 28 percent of export
earnings, presently absorb almost the entire gross capital inflow. The
strengthening of the balance of payments will require sustained efforts
over a wide front. Rapid growth of exports, considerable progress
toward import substitution, and increased flows of official assistance,
as well as continued restraint on suppliers' credits, will be needed
if the present serious foreign exchange bottleneck is to be overcome,
and the external debt burden somewhat reduced in the long run. The need
for quick-disbursing assistance increased substantially as a result of
the flood damage.
10.       At the June meeting of the Consultative Group in Tokyo both
Japan and the United States agreed to increase their sizeable assistance
programs in the Philippines. The additional needs during FY1972/73 result-
ing from the floods are likely to be met almost fully by increased US and
Japanese aid.   The other major sources of assistance are the ADB and
the Bank Group. Given the poverty of the Philippines, the magnitude of
the debt problem, and the general improvement in the management of the
country's economy, it is appropriate that the Bank Group continue its
policy begun last April of providing some IDA funds for the Philippines.
The $12.7 million development credit for this project would be the second
such credit for the Fhilippines.



11.       Even with further improvements in raising public revenues, the
Philippine development program will continue to require resources in
excess of expected local savings and of the foreign capital which will.
become available for financing the import component of development projects.
One reason for this is that there are a number of projects of economic and
social importance,but needing only limited amounts of foreign exchange. In
such cases, which include this project, some local cost financing is
justified.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN
THE FHILIPPINES
12.       The Philippines has received 17 Bank loans and one IDA credit
totalling $278.3 million, net of cancellations. A little over half of
the Bank Group's lending, about $140 million, has been for priority
infrastructure projects in power, transportation, water supply and educa-
tion. The remainder has been divided about equally between agriculture
and industry:  about $70 million for irrigation, livestock, rice process-
ing and rural credit and about $65 million for industry in three loans
to the Private Ievelopment Corporation of the Philippines.
13.       Of total Bank Group lending for the Philippines of $278.3 million,
two loans and one credit totalling $39.5 million were made in the last
quarter of FY1972 and disbursements on these have only just begun. Of the
remaining $238.8 million, the undisbursed balance on October 31, 1972 was
about $55.5 million, almost all of which was accounted for by five loans
made since the beginning of FY1969. Although there have been no serious
problems on any of these five projects, disbursements on three of them are
behind schedule due in part to the general economic slowdown in the
Philippines following the February 1970 devaluation and the subsequent
stabilization program. Disbursements on these loans have now begun to
pick up, although postponements of the closing dates of two loans are
likely. Annex II contains the status of Bank Group operations.
14.       Future Bank Group lending will continue to concentrate on
public infrastructure and agriculture which, as indicated in paragraphs
7 and 8, have high priority and have been relatively neglected by the
Government in the past. The Bank Group will also continue to help
industry and provide more assistance-for social sector projects. In the
agricultural sector, assistance to general agriculture, including rice,
would be continued through further loans for rural credit, and the Govern-
ment would be helped to diversify production through a fisheries project
which was appraised in November. The reconstruction of fishponds damaged
by the recent floods is expected to be included in this project. A
possible irrigation rehabilitation project is also being discussed with
the Government. In addition, a recent agricultural sector mission has
identified several irrigation and credit projects which would promote
export crops, some of which may be prepared for Bank financing in the
years ahead. Bank/IDA infrastructure lending will continue to emphasize
transportation and power projects. The Bank is acting as exBcuting agency



- 5 -
for UNDP-financed feasibility studies for four major ports and for roads
and are financing detailed engineering of some further roads in Luzon under
our first highway project. These studies are expected to lead to loans in
the next twelve months, and a second highway project will include rehabilita-
tion of roads damaged by the floods. The Bank's fifth power project, for
which a loan and credit were signed last April, includes feasibility studies
which could lead to further Bank lending for power in FT1974.   The proposed
education credit, together with a population project which we are helping
to prepare,would increase our role in financing social investments.
15.       I expect Bank Group lending to increase substantially above
present levels provided the economy continues to be managed reasonably
well and provided that the Philippines continues to improve its capacity
to prepare and implement projects.
16.       The Bank's next economic mission will as usual analyze balance
of payments, external debt and fiscal problems. It will give particular
attention to development planning and administration, the public infrastruc-
ture program and industrial policy relating to exports and small-scale
industry. Two sector missions are also scheduled for the coming year:
a telecommunications mission and an industrial mission which, among other
things, will look into the prospects for developing metal-using industries.
17.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $47.3
million for investments in eight companies in the field of development
banking, power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum
products and nickel mining and refining. Of these investments as of
October 31, 1972, $9.3 million have been sold, $O.4 million cancelled
and $0.9 nillion repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $36.7 million. On
the same date, $18.0 million were undisbursed. A loan to the Private
Development Corporation of the Philippines is being considered and
preliminary proposals have been received for an aluminum smelter and other
projects in the pulp and paper, dinnerware, metal alloys and shipbuilding
fields.
PART III - THE SECTOR
18.       The quantitative achievements of the Philippine education system
are impressive:  the literacy   rate (72 percent) is among   the highest
in Asia and virtually all children of the relevant age group now attend
primary school. The enrollment ratios of 71 percent at the secondary level
and 25 percent in higher education are among the highest in the world.
Elementary schools are public but about 60 percent of secondary enroll-
ments and over 90 percent of higher education enrollments are in private
institutions.  However, the uncontrolled expansion of the education system
has led to low-quality instruction often unrelated to economic priorities
and erployment opportunities.



19.       Elementary education covers six years and English is the language
of instruction after the first two years when t-he local vernacular normally
is used.  Elementary teachers are generally adequately qualified and the
pupil-teacher ratio of 30:1 is acceptable. The quality of secondary
education, where the drop-out rate is 25 percent, is the weakest link in
the educational system. Most secondary school teachers are adequately
qualified by local standards but mary teachers of vocational subjects lack
practical experience. Classes are overcrowded and there is a shortage of
equipment and books. Much of the higher education is also of poor quality.
Training of faculty members is often inadequate. An open admission system
allows any secondary school graduate to enter college.   Moreover, the courses
offered frequently produce graduates poorly prepared to enter employment
related to their training.
20.       Vocational and technical education is offered at public and
private schools. There are wide differences in the quality of the instruction.
The drop-out rate is high and liaison between schools and industry
is inadequate. College degrees in engineering are offered at several
public and over 40 private institutions. The number of engineers being
trained far exceeds demand while there is a need for more skilled crafts-
men and technicians. In 1968 a national manpower training program was
started to promote training in skills required by expanding industries and
in 1969 a National Manpower and Youth Council was set up to administer the
program.  The Government with UNDP and ILO assistance plans to develop
regional manpower training centers to train skilled craftsmen needed by
industry.
21.       Agricultural education is provided at the secondary level by
85 public high schools and a number of private high schools. Many of
these schools originally provided practical farming courses for rural
youth but more recently emphasis has been placed on college preparation
ani about 30 agriculture high schools have introduced post-secondary
courses providing training of low quality. The University of the Philip-
pines College of Agriculture has started a Pilot Barrio (Village)
Development School in which pupils spend 50 percent of their time carry-
ing out supervised farming programs on their own or their parents' farms.
The Department of Education has also recently introduced a new experimental
agricultural curriculum in some of its high schools.   This increases
practical training and emphasizes agricultural economics and farm manage-
ment. At the post-secondary level there are many degree-granting
agricultural colleges whose curricula tend to be too academic and not
sufficiently oriented towards current problems of agriculture. Of the
54 degree-granting institutions, only two offer courses in agricultural
business management and six in agricultural engineering. Irrigation is
not taught as a major subject at any institution. Courses in forestry,
one of the major industries in the [hilippines,are offered in only four
institutions and only one of these has adequate training facilities.
22.       The strong demand for education in the Philippines stems from
deeply held social values and the lack of employment opportunities.



-7-
This situation has had a pronounced fiscal impact as expenditures on
education account for 26 percent of the national Government's budget.
Assuming that the present enrollment and population trends would continue,
the Government's education budget (in constant prices) would have to
double over the next ten years if present standards are maintained. The
Philippine Education Survey Conmission, appointed by the President in
1969, recommended that financial responsibility for primary education,
which absorbs 85 percent of the Government's education budget, should
be transferred to the local governments in order to release funds at the
national level for secondary and higher education. It would be extremely
difficult, however, to secure sufficient revenues at the local level to
meet fully the costs of primary education. Whether financing comes from
the central or local governments, measures to halt the rapid increase in
expenditures for primary education are desirable. There is also a need
to rationalize institutions and to control enrollment at the secondary
and higher levels.
23.      1Masures are now being taken to tackle some of these problems.
In the reorganization of the Executive Branch of Government, following
the imposition of martial law, the Department of Education becomes the
Department of Education and Culture, responsible for developing and
implementing education programs based on the general education objectives
and policies set by a Board of National Education. The divisions
or units in the former Department of Education which dealt, almost
independently of each other, with public, private and vocational schools,
are abolished and the new Department will have bureaus for elementary,
secondary and higher education.  In addition, units for Planning Service,
Finance and Management, Administration, and Information and Publication
will be set up in the Department. The Office of Planning Service will
undertake planning, research and project development and provide
secretariat services for the Board of National Education.   A Board
of Higher Education will be created to assist and advise the National
Board of Education in formulating objectives, policies and programs on
post-secondary education.
24.       Education policy will now aim at making the educational system
more responsive to the needs of the country by providing a broad, general
education and promoting the training of skilled manpower. High priority
will be given to technical education and vocational training. Higher
education will be strengthened through a coherent system of public
universities and incentive schemes for inportant programs in private
education. New colleges can be established only on the recommendation
of the National Board of Education. All these reforms should improve
educational policy-making and make it easier for the Government to
manage the educational system. Accreditation of higher education
institutions is in its infancy (28 institutions are members at present)
and the new structure may enable the system to expand more rapidly.
Nonetheless, Government control over the large number of private secondary
and higher educational institutions has been very weak up to now and it
remains to be seen how far these reforms can increase it.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
25.       In January/February 1971, a UNESCO mission visited the Philippines
to identify a project suitable for Bank Group financing.  It July 1971, the
Government requested assistance for a project.which it had.prepared with
the help of UNESCO. The project was appraised in November/December 1971
and negotiations were hel'd in Washington during July 24p-28,. 1972'. The
leader of the Government's delegation,was thle Honorable Eduardo Z.. Romualdez,
Philippine Ambassador to the United States. The appraisal report (No.. PE-50a,
dated November 30, 1972) is being circulated separately to the. Executive
Directors.
26.       This would be the second' Bank Group operation fbr' eduication in
the Philippines. The, first was a Bank loan (Loan 393P-PE.) of $6.0 million
made in 1964 to assist the Government in financing the enwpansion of the.
University of the Philippines College of Agriculture at Los Banos near
Manila.  Despite occasional delays in construction. resulting from short-
ages in local funds the project will be completed satisfactorily by the
end of this year.
Description of the Project
27.       The project would provide for' some of thee needs of'an e-ducation.
development program required,for re-tormvof the education,system..
It would also help to meet manpower needs for economic development'.
Specifically, the proposed' credit would help to. finance the following
conponents:
(i)     & Curriculum Coord.inating Unit,, an Educatibn: Dbvelop-
ment Center,. two Regional Science Teaching Cente'ts). and'
additional equipment for two exi;sting' Centers-:
(ii)    equipment for 13 4didstirrg agricultural high- schools,
expansion of two agricultural col'leges, and six new
pilot village development schools;
(iii)   two new technical institutes) expansion of an extsst-
ing technical institute, and 10 new Regional Manpower
Training Centers;
(iv)    two social (extension) laboratories, a newr agriculture
radio station, and additional equipment for an e-xAst-
ing agriculture radio station;. and.
(v)     te:chnical assistance.



_9-
28.       The items covered under (i) would help to develop improved
curriculum and teaching standards. The Government would form a Curriculum
Coordinating Unit in the new Office of Planning Service to be established
in the Department of Educatioh. The Unit would coordinate curriculum
research and material development and prepare a program to remedy textbook
shortage.  The proposed credit would finance equipment, books and materials
for the Unit. The Government also intends to establish an Education
Development Council to supervise a new Education Development Center combining
the Science Education Center of the University of the Philippines and the
Social Studies Education Center of the Department of Education. IDA would
help finance physical facilities, including office accommodation and equip-
ment for the Council and the Center. The project would also support the
ongoing program of science teaching by establishing two additional Regional
Science Training Centers and upgrading two others by providing books and
equipment.
29.       The 13 agricultural high schools included in the project would
use the new, more practically oriented curricula recently developed by
the Department of Education. The six new pilot village (barrio) develop-
ment schools would provide a program of 50 percent practical classroom
work and 50 percent supervised farming. The project would upgrade two
agricultural universities, Central Mindanao University and Central Luzon
State University, which should, as a result, become strong regional centers
offering courses and providing training adapted to local needs.   In order
to bring overall agricultural education more in line with manpower needs,
the Government plans to undertake a survey of agricultural manpower and
will ensure that, in three years time, agricultural high schools included
in the project offer courses only at the secondary level. The National
Board of Education has recently adopted a resolution declaring that the
establishment of additional degree-granting institutions will be considered
only where there are clear manpower needs for development.
30.       The three technical institutes included in the project would offer
three-year post secondary courses and would provide about 800 technicians
annually. Until a national polytechnic scheme is established, the three
institutes would be administered by a Governing Council which would ensure
that each institute applies the sare curricula and examination standards.
The ten new Regional Manpower Centers wauld offer full time and evening
courses for youth or adults. The combined output of the centers would be
over 7,000 craftsmen per year. The Government would train sufficient
instructors, teachers and supervisors for the technical institutes and
regional manpower centers. The IDA credit would also assist the Central
Mindanao University to establish and the University of the Philippines
College of Agriculture to expand agriculture radio stations and would help
Central Mindanao University and Central Luzon State University to set up
"lsocial laboratories" designed to give on-the-job training to agricultural
extension workers in the villages.
31.       The technical assistance component would consist of 62 man-years of
specialist services and 56 man-years of fellowships. The specialist



-   10
services are designed to strengthen education planning, management and
curriculum development. They would also help the agricultural colleges
and technical institutes and assist in implementing the project.    Some
of the specialists included in the project may be financed by UNDP, in
which case a corresponding amount of the credit may be cancelled or made
available for other uses related to the project.   Furthermore, the
Government intends to obtain additional technical assistance in the form
of 31 man-years of specialist services needed to strengthen educational
planning, curriculum development and manpower training as well as six
man-years of overseas fellowships for curriculum development and teaching
in the ten Regional Manpower Training Centers.   The Government would
also prepare studies on national and regional manpower needs in the
agricultural sector and on ways and means to meet such needs, formulate
plans for supervised farming projects at the agricultural high schools
and pilot village development schools included in the project .and make
arrangements with existing universities to improve agricultural
education, training and extension.
Cost and Financing of the Project
32.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $17.7 million,
of which the foreign exchange component amounts to about $12.4 million
(for details, see Annex III, Credit and Project Summary).   The credit
would finance the direct foreign exchange cost and about $0.3 million
for equipment, furniture and educational materials, for which contracts
are likely to be awarded to local manufacturers.   If qualified Filipinos
are available to fill some of the positions under the technical assistance
component, IDA would finance them.   The remaining local cost of $5
million equivalent would be met by the Government.   To ensure that local
funds are available when needed, the Government has agreed to establish a
Special Fund (as a condition for the Credit to become effective) and to
replenish it at monthly intervals to a level equivalent to the estimated
total amount of payments for goods and services required for the project
during the next three months less the estimated amount of payments to be
made by the Association directly to suppliers, contractors and consultants.
Management Arrangements
33.       The Government has established a Project Unit in the Department
of Edacation which would be responsible for implementing the project.
After consulting the Association, the Government has selected senior
staff members of the Project Unit.
Procurement
34.       Contracts for civil works would be awarded after international
competitive bidding.   Equipment, furniture and educational materials
mould also be procured under international competitive bidding,. with the
exception of contracts for small and diverse items not exceeding.
$40,000, within a total of $250,000, which may be awarded after local



competitive bidding.   As in the case of Loan 637-PH, approved on
August 12, 1969, which was the last occasion on which the Bank financed
directly the local procurement of equipment, materials and supplies
under international competitive bidding for a project in the Philippines,
bids offered by Filipino manufacturers for items of substantially
Filipino origin would be given a preference of 15 percent in camparison
with other bids.   The draft Development Credit Agreement makes appropriate
provision for this; the amount of local procurement eligible for
preferential treatment is not expected to be more than about $300,000.
Disbursement
35.       The credit would be disbursed to meet 100 percent of the c.i.f.
cost of imported, or ex-factory cost of locally produced, equipment,
furniture and supplies, 38 percent of the cost of civil works (including
professional services) and 100 percent of total expenditures for technical
assistance for the project.   The schools would be constructed and equipped
in about three and a half years, but the technical assistance would be
spread over six years.
PART V  - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTXORITI
36.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association
and the Republic of the Philippines, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Association and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
development credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
37.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms to the normal
pattern for credits for education projects and major features of the
Agreement have already been described.
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECO4MENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

C.   Projects in Execution
Loan 386-PH - Manila Water Supply
Disbursements for this project were completed by mid-1970.   The
project was delayed and local currency cost overruns high for a number of
reasons. The performance. of contractors was poor, local suppliers filed
complaints about the award of bids which resulted in court injunctions to
stop work and the agency executing the project had weak management.
Implementation of a rate increase has been long delayed and the executing
agency is in serious financial difficulties.   Lay-offs of excess personnel
have been contested in court.   Some improvement in top management has been
made, but no substantial impact on operations can yet be observed.
Loan 393-PH - Education
This project for the expansion of the College of Agriculture of the
University of the Philippines has been progressing satisfactorily on the
whole, although it has encountered occasional delays due to shortage of
peso finds.   The project was basically completed by mid-1970, but the
Bank has agreed to the University's request to use project savings to
finance additional related site development and equipment items.   The
Closing Date has been postponed to December 31, 1972 and the project is
expected to be satisfactorily completed by that time.
Loan 491-PH - Power
This project was to assist the National Power Corporation in
financing the construction of a 75-MW thermal plant on the Bataan
Peninsula and a 50-MW addition to the Maria Christina Hydroelectric Plant
in Mindanao.   Construction of the Maria Christina addition was completed
in 1970 and that of the Bataan plant in March 1972.   Delays have
occurred initially because of slow government approval of contract awards
and subsequently because of financial difficulties of the civil works
contractor for Bataan, and strikes in suppliers' countries and some
equipment failures.   The undisbursed balance of $1.3 million of the Bank
loan represents the retention requirements for equipment supplied under
the project. The Closing Date has been further postponed by 18 months to
December 31, 1973.
Loan 607-PH - Second Rural Credit
The slow progress of the Project at first was mainly due to the steep
rise in prices of farm machinery after the peso was allowed to float in
February 1970.   The resulting increases in prices of farm produce,
together with decentralization of loan sanctioning, strengthening of staff
and promotional efforts, have helped improve the pace of disbursements but
postponement of the Closing Date of March 31, 1973 by 15 months will
probably be required.

Loan 630-PH - Development Finance Company
The third loan in an amount of $25 million to the Private Development
Corporation of the Philippines,(PDCP) has been fully committed for sub-
projects, but as of October   31, 1972, $3.8 million of the loan remained
undisbursed, a rate of disbursement slower than expected. The main
reason for this was the general deterioration in the business climate
following the devaluation of the peso  in February 1970.   A postponement
of the present Closing Date of March 31, 1973 by 12 months may be needed.
Loan 637-PH - Irrigation
This project is to help finance the construction of a dam on the
Upper Pampanga River in Central Luzon and the construction and
rehabilitation of irrigation facilities serving about 77,000 hectares.
The project got off to a good start and is progressing satisfactorily.
A,supervision mission visited Manila in September/October 1972 to review
the progress of this project and is preparing its report.
Loan 720-PH - Rice Processing and Storage
This project was designed to provide long-term credit to the private
sector for setting up modern integrated rice processing and storage units
in the private sector.   It would increase rice processing capacity by
480,000 tons of paddy rice per year or 320,000 tons of milled rice per
year.   The loan was made to the Government which would in turn onlend the
proceeds to the Development Bank of the Philippines, responsible for
administering the project.   Disbursement has been very slow in part
because of the deterioration in the investment climate following the peso
devaluation.   Another factor was the detrimental effect of poor weather,
disease and reduced use of fertilizer due to credit restrictions, on the
1970/71 rice crops.   The lower than anticipated demand for investment in
new integrated storage units and administrative arrangements and procedures
caused some delay in processing of sub-loans.   The project was substantially
revised in accordance with the memorandum of the President to the Executive
Directors dated June 8, 1972 (R72-40) to allow for more emphasis on
lending for rehabilitation and improvement of existing facilities, and to
simplify administrative arrangements and procedures.   These changes are
expected to lead to an increase in the rate of disbursement.
Loan 731-PH - Highway
This project for the construction and improvement of the 'Cotabato-
Digos road (160 km) in Mindanao is progressing'satisfactorily.   The
project also includes two components financed by UNDP; technical
assistance to the Bureau of Public Highways (BPH) for operational
improvements and feasibility studies for future highway projects.   Work
on the technical assistance component is progressing well and the
feasibility studies'have been completed.

Loan 809-PH and Credit 296-PH - Fifth Power
Invitation to bid for main equipment is in the process of being
revised.   Prequalification of bidders for civil works is under way.
A supervision mission is scheduled for late November 1972.
Loan 823-PH - Livestock
This loan became effective on November 9.   The project is
progressing satisfactorily.
