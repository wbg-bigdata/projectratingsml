THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(Loan 1737-CO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Completion Report on the Third Agricultural Credit
Project (Loan 1737-CO), for which a loan of US$20.0 millinn was approved on
June 21, 1979. The legal documents were signed on November 30, 1979, and the
project became effective on October 1, 1980. The original Closing Date for
the loan was June 30, 1985. One extension was granted, and the final Closing
Date was June 30, 1986. The final disbursement took place in April 1987.
The loan was fully disbursed.
Over 1966 to 1979, the Bank had made 10 loans to Colombia for
agricultural development, and the Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform
(INCORA), the Borrower under this project, was the executing agency for six
of them: Atlantico I Irrigation (Loaa 502-CO); First Agricultural Credit
(Loan 624-CO); Caqueta Land Colonization Phase I (Loan 739-CO); Second
Atlantico Development (Loan 849-CO); Caqueta II Rural Settlement
(Loan 1118-CO); and Cordova II Agricultural Development (Loan 1163-CO).
PPAR's have been prepared, and in general the project objectives were
attained.
This report was prepared by Agriculture Division A of the Latin
America and the Caribbean Regional Office on the basis of a Bank/FAO CP
mission in February 1987, which reviewed a draft project completion report
prepared by INCORA's monitoring and evaluation unit and delivered to the Bank
in January 1987; information on the project available in the Bank, such as
the Appraisal Report No. 2491-CO dated June 6, 1979; the Loan Agreement and
Guarantee Agreement dated November 30, 1979; supervision reports,
correspondence with the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda contained in
relevant Bank files; and discussions with Bank staff associated with the
project.
A copy of the draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on February 25,
1988 for comments. Comments received from INCORA appear as an Attachment to
the report.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

COLOMBIA
THIRD AGRICUITURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(Loan 1737-CO)
PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
Thls was ths seventh Bank-supported project for INCORA's agricul-
tural development projects in Colombia. It was initiated when INCORA's capa-
bilities as executing agency for Bank-fiLnanced projects had deteriorated
steadily, mainly due to the Government's lack of political commitment to
INCORA (para. 4.01).
Objectives
The project objectives were to increase the income and employment
of about 7,600 families; and to assist small-scale farmers in developing
self-sustaining, viable farms, so that farmers could eventually graduate from
INCORA's assistance (para. 2.02).
Implementation Experience
Project funds were expected to be disbursed over five and a half
years but were actually disbursed over seven years. Delays occurred during
the first four years of implementation because INCORA consisteitly had
insufficient counterpart funds.  A problem that surfaced during the first
two years was the longer than anticipated procurement process for the
acquisition of vehicles (para. 3.03). The total cost of the project in US
dollar terms was about 17% below appraisal estimates. Due to the
Government's continuing financial constraints, the Bank agreed in August 1984
that INCORA could use the proceeds of subloan recoveries as counterpart funds
to Bank resources. Moreover, in order to speed up disbursements, the Bank
included this project under the Special Action Program for Colombia in April
1985 (para. 3.14).  The performance of INCORA in -mplementing the project has
been satisfactory (para. 4.01). The Bank's performance was also satisfactory
(para. 5.01).
Results
The general objective of increasing the production of food crops
and livestock by small farmers has been attained, although not as anticipated
at appraisal (paras. 6.02-6.05). The objective of helping INCORA benefi-
ciaries to become self-sustaining, viable farmers has also been attained to
some extent, though these farmers have not graduated from INCORA's
assistance. Regarding the number of beneficiaries, the project achieved its
goals. The economic impact of the credit component was lower than
anticipated (para. 6.08).



- iv -
Sustainability
The pirospects for sustainability of benefits from the project's
investments appear good at this time. Credit activities are expected to
continue utilizing the recoveries of subloarts under the project an(- 1lso
funds furnished by INCORA's other lines of credit.
Findings and Lessons Learned
The main lessons to be learned are that: (a) the Bank should
proviae more direct guidance and enforce the fulfillment of agreed
consultant services to establish an adequate M&E system at the start of a
project; (b) standardization of procurement bidding documents and procedures
for Bank-assisted projects in Colombia should accelerate procurement in the
future; (c) the Bank must take strocng action from the start of implementation
to ensure compliance with such conditions of the Loan Agreement as timely
presentation to the Bank of audited financial statements; (d) future INCORA
projects of this kind financed by the Bank should have a Project Coordinator
with a high rank within the institution and working full time for the
project; (e) technical assistance to project beneficiaries proved to be
expensive and there was no link between INCORA's extension service and ICA's
services; and (f) INCORA should confine its activities ro those in which it
has gained more experience, and which are in line with its specific
objectives of land tenancy, land distribution, issuance of land titles and
land settlement projects (para. 7.02).



COLOMBIA
THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(Loan 1737-CO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      At project appraisal in November 1978, Colombia's GNP per capita
was US$760. The agricultural sector was the most important of the economy,
accounting for 30% of employment, 28% of GDP and 65% of total merchandise
exports. Coffee, grown in the Andes by small and medium-sized farmers,
accounted for 76% of the sector's total exports. Other major export crops in
order of importance were: cotton, bananas and plantain, livestock (beef and
cattle), sugar, rice, flowers and tobacco. The total population was about 25
million in 1977 and the rural population numbered nearly nine million. The
agricultural sector had a favorable balance of trade, with total food imports
(mainly wheat) averaging about 11% of total food exports.  The Government's
agricultural development strategy was to reduce disparities between rural and
urban incomes by improving living conditions and nutrition, and to secure
higher export earnings. Land redistribution, however, did not have top
priority; it was to be carried out only in response to iocal circumstances in
areas with both high pressure on land and unequal distribution, but it was
not regarded as the primary means for reducing rural poverty. The Bank
supported this strategy and agreed to finance land reform/colonization
beneficiaries who had limited access to credit and technical assistance.
1.02      Over the past eight years, some changes have occurred in the struc-
ture of the economy: agriculture is still the most important sector of the
economy, slowly decreasing to about 25% of employment and 22% of GDP, but
increasing its share in the country's total registered merchandise exports to
70%. Of the total value of agricultural exports of about US$2 billion in
1983, coffee accounted for 73%, followed by bananas (7%) and flo' ers (6%), a
marked change compared with 1978. Food imports accounted for 7.5% of total
registered imports. The population was about 28.4 million in 1985, and GNP
per capita was estimated at US$1,320 that year. The rate of growth of
agricultural production was about 4% in the seventies, but fell to 1.3% in
the early eighties. The Government is now giving priority to projects that
would reduce violence in the countryside (Peace Plan) and others that would
make more efficient use of existing infrastructure. Subsequent to the Third
Agricultural Credit Project, the Bank has financed seven projects in the
sector: the Irrigation RehabilItation I Project (Loan 1996-CO); the Upper
Magdalena Watershed Management Project (Loan 2069-CO); the Integrated Rural
Development II Project (Loan 2174-CO); the Agricultural Research and
Extension Project (Loan 2303-CO); the Agricultural Diversification Project
(Loan 2453-CO); the Irrigat.on Diversification II Project (Loan 2667-CO); and
the Trade and Agricultural P_`-, Project (Loan 2677-CO).

1I. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Identification Through Board Approval*
2.01      The project was identified in April 1978 by an FAO/CP mission, and
preparation was completed by the Government and FAO/CP in September 1978.
The project was appraised by the Bank during November/December 1978. Nego-
tiations took place in Washington, DC, on May 21-30, 1979. The loan was
approved by the Board on ,une 21, 1979, without significant discussion.
B. Project Objectives and Components
2.02      Objectives.  The main objective was to increase the income and
employment of about 7,620 families. Another objective was to assist
beneficiaries of the Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCORA), the
small-scale farmer subsector, in developing their farms to a point at which
they would become self-sustaining, viable farmers. These farmers would
eventually "graduate' from INCORA assistance, thereby making it possible for
INCORA to extend its assistance to other beneficiaries.
2.03      Components.  The project included supervised credit for on-farm
development, including short-term incremental working capital, and for the
development of small agroindustries; and technical assistance, including
consultant services, training programs for INCORA field staff and benefi-
ciaries, vehicles and equipment for staff providing assistance and for the
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) unit, and some staff salaries.
C. Project Cost and Financing
2.04      At appraisal, the total project cost was estimated at US$50.0
million, of which the Bank was to contribute US$20.0 million (40%) to cover
the foreign exchange costs estimated at US$17.5 million (35%) and US$2.5
million (5%) of local currency costs. The Government was to contribute
US$24.6 million (49%) as an equity contribution to INCORA, and farmers, the
remaining US$5.4 million (11%).
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Introduction.  This chapter compares actual performance with the
targets established at appraisal, including an analysis of implementation of
the main items financed (credit, consultants and training, and vehicles and
equipment). assessment of project cost, disbursements, procurement, reporttng
and auditing, and compliance with loan covenants. The implementation
schedule is presented first.
A. Implementation Schedule
3.02      Effectiveness.  The Loan became effective on October 1, 1980,
fifteen months after Board approval and seven months later than tba appraisal
estimate. The delay occurred because it took more time than anticipated to
si.gn the Subsidiary Contract for Loan Administration between INCORA and Caja
de Credito Agrario, Industrial y Minero (CAJA).



-3-
3.03      Implementation Period.  According to appraisal projections, the
Loan was expected to be closed by June 30, 1985; the actual Closing Date was
June 30, 1986, a one-year delay. Project funds were expected to be disbursed
over five and a half years but were actually disbursed over seven years.
Delays occurred during the first four years because INCORA consistently
suffered from insufficient counterpart funds. Moreover, the following
problems initially delayed implementation: (a) INCORA's non-compliance with
Section 4.04(c) and Schedule 5c 2(a) of the Loan Agreement, which required,
first, that the annual value of new loans made by INCORA with tunds other
than project funds should be no less than the average annual value of new
loans for the three-year period 1975-77, and second, that an effective rate
of interest of at least 16% per annum be obtained or, all subloans granted by
INCORA; and (b) the longer than anticipated procurement process for the
acquisition of vehicles. These problems were satisfactorily resolved during
the first two years of implementation (see para. 3.16 for discussion of
procurement issue).
B. Implementatior of Project Components
3.04      Credit Component.  The key indicators of the credit component are
presented in Annex 1. The project financed a total of 6,002 subloans, 122%
of the appraisal estimate of 4,920. Out of the total subloans, 5,802 were
granted to individual farmers and 200 to collective farms (empresas comunita-
rias), as compared with 4,620 and 300 respectively estimated at appraisal.
This indicates a broader distribution of benefits under the project than
anticipated. About 40% of the volume of credit was used for crup
development, 52% for livestock develapment, and the remaining 8% for other
investments, including agroindustries. This distribution between productive
and other investments is almost the same as anticipate4 at appraisal. The
average amount of subloan per beneficiary was also almost the same as
expected at appraisal.
3.05      Crops accounted for 2,341 of the subloans, compared with 3,690
envisaged at appraisal. Most of these were made for rice, vegetables and
fruits. About 3,180 of the subloans were made for livestock development
(about 360% of the appraisal estimate of 886). Most of these were made for
dual-purpose cattle (dairy and beef). About 480 of the subloans were made
for other investments, including agroindustries, compared with 344 estimated
at appraisal.  During project implementation, farmers continued to vary
combinations of crops and livestock and changed the production patterns
envisaged at appraisal to more diversified patterns oriented by commercial
activities and better farmgate prices (see also para. 6.01).
3.06      As a result of these changes, the rate of recovery has steadily
improved and, up to September 30, 1986, the project rezovery rate was 87%
(this figure relates the amount actually repaid by September 30, 1.986, to the
sum in arrears up to December 31, 1985, and the amount that fell due txp to
September 30, 1986). However, at appraisal, INCORA had a poor performance in
loan recovery for its own lines of credit (for land purchases by settlers,
machinery and housing, and supervised credit for settlers) compared with its
Bank co-financed lines of credit. This situation has also improved, with
recovery ratios of 28% in 1981 and 43% in 1982 improvivg to about 70% by
September 30, 1986. Although the rate of recover, for INCORA's overall
portfolio is still unsatisfactory, it is worthwhile to mentiou tb-- in
general the arrears are very young and more improvement is expected shortly.

3.07      It was expected that farmers assisted under the project would
develop financially viable farms and eventually be able to graduate from
INCORA assistance, allowing INCORA to assist new beneficiaries (para. 2.02).
During project implementation, several different lines of credit were
available to INCORA's beneficiaries, and as a result no graduation policy
ex4sts at this time. This makes it difficult to evaluate INCORA's
achievements in terms of creating viable farm units, and there is no pressure
on INCORA to systematically extend its assistance to new beneficiaries.
3.08      INCORA signed a subsidiary contract for loan administration with
CAJA, and no coordination problems were anticipated because its association
with CAJA for lending to agrarian reform beneficiaries (through trust funds
or guarantee agreements) had been working successfully since 1965. However,
during project implementation, the flow of information between CAJA and
INCORA left iuch to be desired. CAJA's information system was centralized
and all field information went to CAJA's headquarters where it was
consolidated. Also, the accounts of CAJA and those of INCORA did not
reconcile because they were closed monthly on different dates. Although some
improvement in coordination has recently been achieved by the new management
of both institutions, more has to be done to resolve these problems.
3.09      Technical Assistance.  The project included about US$0.8 million
for consultant services, training and salaries, but only about US$0.1 million
was actually spent by INCORA. Financing of 24 months of consultant services
was anticipated at appraisal to assist in establishing a monitoring and
evaluation system to assess project impact and to provide training for INCORA
technicians. Although INCORA established the M&E unit, its management
thought that the consultants were unnecessary and did not support the idea of
hiring them. This attitude was maintained by INCORA's management throughout
project implementation, even though INCORA had five different general
managers over that period.
3.10      The project also provided funds to finance short-term overseas
training for about 12 professionals and short local study-tours and on-the-
job training for about 290 technicians and project beneficiaries. INCORA
signed an agreement with the InterAmerican Institute for Agricultural
Cooperation (IICA) and a specific training program was prepared for the over-
seas training of INCORA's professionals to be carried out by IICA. This
activity did not take place, mainly because the internal process of selecting
and approving the prospective candidates was too cumbersome and time
consuming. Some local training was provided using project funds, and INCORA
also financed with its own resources 10 courses for 241 participants under
the INCORA/IICA agreement.
3.11      INCORA provided technical assistance to project beneficiaries and
has accumulated a lot of experience in handling its credit programs, while
CAJA acted only as the banking agent for the project. However, implementa-
tion of the technical assistance was not coordinated among the 12 project
regions. Moreover, technical assistance was oriented to individual producers
rather than to groups, making the provision of assistance more expensive and
time consuming.



- 5 -
3.12      There are currently 694 professionals and technicians providing
technical assistance under the credit component, compared with 534 that were
working at appraisal. The ratio of technicians to individual subloans is now
1:34 compared with 1:40 called for at appraisal. Experience of most of the
professionals is acceptable. It was anticipated that INCORA would train its
technicians to allow them to become more familiar with technology packages
developed by ICA (the Colombian Agricultural Institute, which is in charge of
agricultural research and extension at the national level) for the different
types of agricultural and livestock operations practised in the project
areas, but this did not happen. INCORA officials stated that during the
first years of project implementation, ICA was being reorganized and did not
have sufficient professional staff available to train INCORA's technicians.
3.13      Acquisition of Vehicles and Equipment.  The project included about
US$1.8 million for the acquisition of 132 vehicles and 90 motorcycles
required to provide technical assistance to project beneficiaries and for the
M&E unit. Actual expenditure was about US$1.3 million. A higher number of
units was acquired (140 vehicles and 103 motorcycles), suggesting lower unit
costs than anticipated at appraisal.
C. Cost Estimate
3.14      The total cost of the project at completion is estimated at
US$41.4 million, as compared with an appraisal estimate of US$50.0 million.
The Government, which was supposed to furnish all the project counterpart
funds (US$24.6 million) as equity to INCORA, provided only US$12.2 million.
In view of the Government's continuing financial constraints, INCORA suftered
from insufficient counterpart funding, and the Ba.nk agreed in August 1984
that INCORA could use the proceeds of subloan recoveries as counterpart funds
to Bank resources. INCORA actually financed US$4.6 million (11%) of the
total project cost out of its own resources. The Bank financed 100% of its
share of the project cost, and, in order to speed up disbursements, in April
1985 the Bank included this project under the Special Action Program for
Colombia and increased the disbursement percentage of the credit component
from 46% to 70%. The lower cost of the technical assistance component was
discussed in para. 3.09. A comparison of actual costs with expected costs at
appraisal is shown below:

/a Projezt contingencies (US$8.5 million) are not broken down by component
in the SAR. Contingencies of US$0.3 million were added to the base cost
of the non-credit component, based on expenditures shown in SAR Table 8
of Annex 3 and projected price increases given in para. 3.10 of the SAR.
The remaining contingencies (US$8.2 million) were applied to the credit
component.

D. Disbursements
3.15      The table below shows actual and estimated disbursements by compo-
nent, as well as actual and estimated expenditures by the Government, INCORA
and credit beneficiaries. It is important to point out that during the first
four years of project implementation, only 45% of Bank funds were disbursed,
as shown in the Basic Data Table (page iv). Moreover, the Bank suspended
disbursements for all INCORA subloans using Bank funds for a five-month
period (February 10 to July 12, 1983). This was because INCORA had not
complied with an agreed action plan whereby it was to split its assets with
the Colombian Institute for Hydrology, Meteorology and Land Improvement
(HIMAT), and deliver to the Bank satisfactory reports covering analysis of
its delinquent portfolio and the impact evaluation of the project for 1981.
The suspension of disbursements was lifted when INCORA complied with these
requirements.

E. Procurement
3.16      Procurement of vehicles and equipment was carried out with some
delays. A first international competitive bidding (ICB) was held on
October 8, 1980, and declared void by INCORA's Board on December 1, 1980,
mainly on legal grounds. A second ICB was held on June 2, 1981, and this too
was declared void on July 29, 1981, again for legal reasons. INCORA's Board
then authorized its general manager to undertake international shopping fol-
lowing procedures of local law 150 (unsatisfactory to the Bank) and 22 firms



-7-
were contacted. In order to speed up the acquisition of vehicles, on
October 1, 1981, the Bank sent a telex to INCORA stating that it had no
objection to the direct shopping procedure, provided that the award process
be consistent with the already established criteria of the bidding documents,
previously approved by the Bank, including award of the contract to the
lowest satisfactory bidder. Goods financed under the subloans were procured
directly by the beneficiaries and no serious problems were encountered.
3.17      In order to facilitate procurement in Colombia, the Bank agreed to
amend all the ongoing Loan Agreements in September 1984. The Borrower
prepared and furnished to the Bank standardized bidding documents and
procedures, satisfactory to the Bank, for goods, vehicles and equipment, and
civil works to be procured locally.
F. Reporting
3.18      Under the project, a M&E unit was established at INCORA
headquarters, and one officer assigned in each region (part-time only) to be
responsible for M&E activities at the field level. The unit was expected to
be a tool for management decision-making and would prepare quarterly and
annual monitoring reports, annual evaluation reports and the project
completion report. The consultants in M&E techniques that were supposed to
be hired for establisting procedures during the initial operation of the
system were not hired, as explained in para. 3.09, and the technical staff of
the unit still require training. Although the unit was staffed and
maintained and has produced all the reports that were anticipated at
appraisal, timely presentation of the reports has not been possible for lack
of management support to the unit, operational funds and electronic
processing equipment (all the calculations are done by hand).
G. Auditing
3.19      The project accounts and related financial statements were audited
annually by the Controller General of the Republic of Colombia. The presen-
tation of these reports to the Bank was frequently delayed by eight to ten
months. The auditors have consistently given INCORA's financial statements a
negative opinion due to persistent accounting and managerial problems, and
the discrepancy between the balances of INCORA and CAJA. However, during
project implementation, INCORA has accomplished many of the actions that the
Bank has been urging for years. These included: (a) the installation of a
new accounting system with the introduction of a "double-entry" system, the
expansion of the code of accounts and the decentralization of the accounting
system; (b) the analysis of its loan portfolio problems; (c) the
establishment of procedures for collection of the overdue portfolio,
providing write-offs for uncollectable loans and setting up reserves for bad
debts; (d) the design and generation of computer-printed basic financial
statements; and (e) the transfer to HIMAT of the irrigation district assets.
H. Compliance with Loan Covenants
3.20      INCORA did not comply with the condition of Section 3.05 (a) of the
Loan Agreement, which states that INCORA shall employ consultants on



-8-
monitoring and evaluation techniques. INCORA also did not fully comply with
Schedule 2, Part B (2) and (3) of the Loan Agreement, which states that the
project shall provide short-term overseas training and local study tours and
on-the-job training for technicians and project beneficiaries.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.01      The performance of INCORA in implementing the project has been
satisfactory because of the great effort it made to improve its accounting
system and the rate of recovery of its overall portfolio, and because it
established the M&E unit. When the project was appraised, INCORA's
capabilities as executing agency for Bank-financed projects had deteriorated
steadily, mainly due to the Government's lack of commitment to INCORA. The
project required: (a) the appointment of a project coordinator; (b) the
establishment of a revolving fund; (c) changes in INCORA's financial and
management information systems; and (d) the timely provision of adequate
counterpart funds, which would increase INCORA's equity. A project
coordinator was appointed but did not have a high rank within the
institution, did not have direct access to the general manager, did not
work on the project full-time, and was not delegated the responsibilities
anticipated at appraisal. The revolving fund was established and helped to
speed up Bank disbursements, although it was not replenished in a timely
manner. INCORA improved its project management, accounting and financial
information systems, although the presentation of reports was seldom timely.
The project suffered from its inception from insufficient counterpart
funding.
V. ROLE OF THE BANK
5.01      The role played by the Bank throughout the execution of the project
was satisfactory. The Bank acted in a supportive and flexible manner in
responding to the Government's requests for: (a) using the proceeds of sub-
loan recoveries as counterpart funds; (b) increasing the Bank's disbursement
percentages of the credit component; (c) reallocating the proceeds of the
loan; and (d) extending the Closing Date for the loan to allow completion of
the project. The appraisal was optinistic in anticipating the timely
presentation of INCORA's audited financial statements, and in expecting that
INCORA's beneficiaries would eventually be "graduated" from INCORA
assistance. The Bank could have taken a more forceful position early on to
ensure the contracting of M&E consultants and training of the M&E unit's
staff.
VI. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
6.01      Investment under the project took place over a large geographical
area involving differences in soils, climate, markets, supply of inputs and
communication infrastructure, and, thus, a wide range of production pat-
terns. The agricultural impact of the project is based in an inquiry
conducted by INCORA over 897 families in 12 regions. These families were
asked for information about land use, and the volume and cost of production
in the latest five years. The surveyed farms also made investments using
credit from INCORA's other lines of credit, and it was not possible to
identify investments using different lines of credit. However, the following
data attempt to estimate changes in the survey farms that are attributable to
the project subloans. The production patterns changed as envisaged at



-9-
appraisal, and production increases came mainly through expansion of the
cropped area and the gradual introduction of proven intermediate technology
already known in the project area. The table below shows in general farmers'
preference for investing in livestock, annual crops and some irrigation
facilities:

6.05      The total value of the incremental production generated by the
project was about US$4.8 million in constant prices compared with

Financial Rate of Return
6.06      As explained earlier, the production pattern changed during project
implementation. Actual farm models analyzed by the completion mission did
not resemble the ones anticipated at appraisal. The main differences are:
(a) rainfed individual agricultural farms (SAR Model 1) and collective beef
farms (SAR Model 4) do not exist; (b) mixed livestock collective farms (about
60 ha average size) have actually been developed mainly for rainfed crops;
and (c) there is a substantial farm size difference between the actual mixed

livestock collective farm (about 275 ha) and the one estimated at appraisal
(142 ha, see SAR Model 3). The following table sumarizes the typical 5 farm

Economic Rate of Return
6.07      As already explained, it was not possible to identify the area
benefitting solely from credit provided under the project. For the ERR
calculation, the project area was estimated by expressing project funds as a
percentage of total funding from all INCORA lines of credit, and applying
that percentage to the total area financed by all INCORA credit lines.
The main assumptions used in the ERR analysis were as follows: (a) the
exchange rate was the 1986 average published by IMF: US$1.00 - Col$ 194.26;
(b) agricultural prices were the Bank's projections for 1986, adjusted for
transport costs, etc.; some were also adjusted using conversion factors from
the Bank's Working Paper No. 357. In particular, prices of local marketed
products were adjusted using the standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.92,



- 12 -
while in the specific cases of milk and beef, the SCFs used were 0.64 and
0.90, respectively; (c) input prices were also adjusted using SCFs; (d) the
total project cost at current prices was adjusted to 1986 constant prices;
(e) in view of the size of the project area (12 INCORA regions), an SCF of
0.87 was used for labor; and (f) the life of the project was estimated at
20 years.
6.08      The estimated ERR was 11.9% (see Annex 2), 32% of the appraisal
estimate (38%). This lower than anticipated ERR is due mainly to the
decrease in project area for the most important crops: 67% for rice and 8%
for sugar and cocoa (para. 6.01). Moreover, most yields were a little lower
than anticipated (para. 6.03). The net incremental value of production was
also 55% less than estimated at appraisal (para. 6.05).
VII. SUMMARY AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      Summary.  The objective of increasing the production of food crops
and livestock has been attained by the project, although not as envisaged at
appraisal. The objective of assisting INCORA's beneficiaries to become
self-sustaining viable farmers has also been attained to some extent
(different INCORA lines of credit continue to be available to farmers).
However, these farmers did not graduate from INCORA's assistance
(para. 3.07). Regarding the number of beneficiaries, the project achieved
its goal. The project cost was 83% of the appraisal estimate. The
performance of the implementing agency (INCORA) has been satisfactory. The
economic impact of the credit component was lower than anticipated
(para. 6.08).
7.02      Lessons Learned
(a) As in previous Bank-financed projects implemented by INCORA, this
project was a good vehicle for gradually achieving improvements in
INCORA's institutional management. INCORA organized an M&E unit
but failed to train the staff of the unit. The Bank should provide
more direct guidance and enforce contracting of the agreed
consultant services to establish an adequate moni;:oring and
evaluation system at the start of a project;
(b) procurement of goods and services has caused many delays in the
past. The standardization of bidding documents and procedures for
Bank-asr4sted projects in Colombia should accelerate the
procurement process in the future;
(c) as in almost all Bank-assisted projects in Colombia, presentation
to the Bank of audited financial statements was always delayed by
more than eight months. The Bank must take strong action from the
beginning to ensure proper compliance with this condition of the
Loan Agreement;
(d) although the project had a good Project Coordinator, he did not
have a high rank within the institution. Many issues could have
been resolved early on if the Project Coordinator had worked
full-time on the project and had had direct access to the General
Manager;



- 13 -
(e)  provision of technical assistance to project beneficiaries proved
to be expensive, mainly because it was oriented to individual
farmers rather than to groups of farmers, but also because there
was no link between INCORA's extension service and ICA's services;
and
(f) INCORA has been an autonomous government institution in charge of
reforming the agrarian social structure of Colombia for 25 years.
Now that the Government is giving it new emphasis and more support,
its current broad range of activities should be analyzed so that
they can be confined to those in which it has gained more
experience and which are in line with its specific objectives, such
as land tenancy, land distribution to beneficiaries, issuance of
land titles, and specific land settlement projects.

CCUMKNTS fOl  INSTITUTO COLOHIIANO DE LA RIFORMA AGRARIA (INCORA)
Letter translated from Spanish
BogotA
8 April 1988
Mr. Graham Donaldson
Division Chief
Agriculturo, Infrastructure and Human Resources
Operations Evaluation Department
World Bank
Washington, DC
Dear Mr. Donaldson:
We acknowledge receipt of the Project Completion Report on the
Colombia - Third Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1737-CO).
We find the PCR in general terms reflects the actual events during
project implementation and the analyses made by the project's supervision
missions. We would like to point out that the total project cost of
US$41.4 million given in the PCR includes only the Bank loan (US$20
million) and the local counterpart associated with the loan. INCORA's
total costs were US$52.8 million, broken down as follows: the Bank loan
for US$20 million; US$12.2 million from the national budget; US$12.4
million from INCORA's own resources; US$5.4 million by subborrowers; and
US$2.8 million provided by INCORA for the project's operating costs.
The allocation for the component of training and consultants
amounted to  US$430,000,  including  local  counterpart  funds.   From this
amount, US$314,000 was spent on training in the country. The investments
on vehicles and equipment amounted to US$1.8 million and financed 140
vehicles, 103 motorcycles, and data processing and office equipment.
Finally, we would like to point out that the satisfactory
performance by the Bank during project Implementation enabled INCORA to
reach the basic objectives estimated at appraisal.
Sincerely yours,
Fabio Bermudez Gomez
General Manager
