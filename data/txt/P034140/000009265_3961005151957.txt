MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF AiGRIA FOR
AN EMERGENCY DESERT LOCUST CONTROL PROJF7T
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and reconmendation on
a proposed loan to Algeria for the equivalent of US$30.0 miilion to help finance
an emergency project for the national control of desert locusts. The loan would
be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years,
including 5 years of grace.
2.    Eackaro .  The desert locust (Schistocerca  are_aria) is a serious pest
to agriculture throughout the Maghreb and the Sahel. Outbreaks of the species
are cyclical in nature, occur periodically, and can cause significant damage to
forests,  rangelands,  and crops in the region.   Given favorable climatic
conditions and uncontrolled breeding, plagues can develop rapidly.   Once
established, a locust outbreak can last up to 11 years and hinder farming
development in dozens of countries, thus affecting millions of people. Desert
locust populations started to build up in the Sahel in 1985 with the return of
normal rainfalls and have since been growing constantly due to suitable weather
conditions. Major swarm populations invaded Algeria in October-December 1987 and
between February and July 1988, necessitating large-scale control operations.
Experts predicted a reinvasion of the country, to begin in September 1988 and to
last for the following two years. On September 14, 1988, the Government of
Algeria thus requested urgent Bank support to assist in its locust control
efforts. The Bank mobilized the necessary financing and approved Loan 3017-AL,
in the amount of US$58 million, on January 31, 1989.
3.    The 1987-1988 invasion was exceptionally brief, however.  Between the
period 1988 to 1990 covered by the Bank loan, locust activity was far below
expectations. This was due to climatic phenomena which included torrential rains
in the Sahel and in East Africa in the summer of 1988 followed by strong winds
registered from East to West in the fall of that same year. The winds dragged
most of the swarm populations over the Atlantic. The reduction in the locust
population was also attributable to the successful treatment efforts undertaken
by Algeria.  As the threat seemed to have disappeared, US$36 million were
cancelled from the World Bank Loan 3017-AL on February 6, 1991.
4.     Following successful breeding of the desert locust on both sides of the
Red Sea between December 1992 and June 1993, many swarms originating from Sudan,
Eritrea, Yemen and Saudi Arabia have moved westward to reach successively Chad,
Niger, Mali and Mauritania. Another wave went eastward and reached Pakistan and
India. Over a few weeks, travel by these swarms exceeded 5,000 km westward and
3,000 km eastward.   The average swarm numbers no less than 150 million adults,
weighs 225 tons, and devours at least 100 tons of green vegetation daily. Given
the favorable climatic conditions that have prevailed in recent weeks in the
Sahel, it is estimated that both Morocco and Algeria are now facing a very
serious threat as of November 1993.
5.    It is anticipated that a first wave of desert locust swarms will head North
in November/December 1993.  They will likely be temporarily stopped by the
seasonally cold weather prevailing over the Sahara Atlas mountain chain. As the
locusts will be less active due to the cold, the authorities plan to destroy them
on the ground using the country's last reserves of pesticides equivalent to some
650,000 liters to be spread by a fleet of 100 specially equipped trucks with an



-2-
overall daily fleet capacity of about 40,000 liters. A second, much larger wave
is likely to invade Algeria in February/March 1994 as a result of winter breeding
in Mauritania, where rainfall has favored vegetation regrowth.   Algeria' s
southern oases are under the imminent threat of invasions in December 1993 and
in February/March 1994. Moreover, the fertile coastal area to the North where
most of the country'sa cereals, vegetable and horticulture crops are located,
could face devastating damage in the spring of 1994. As temperatures increase
markedly in late February and early March, the locusts will be on the move once
again.   The treatment will then require the rental of specially equipped
commercial aircraft in order to eradicate as many swarms as possible before they
reach the oases and the fertile coastland.
6.    Progeot Obiectives.  The proposed project would have two main objectives.
The first would be to provide urgent assistance in support of Algeria's national
locust control program. The second would be to further reinforce the existing
surveillance and warning systems, enabling the country to better predict locust
activity and movements, thus facilitating planning and implementation of future
control programs in situations of both plague and recession. The early warning
activities financed under the project will also benefit other countries in the
region as explained in para. 11.  The project will essentially consist of
disaster prevention rather than disaster relief and the dealing with an existing
emergency.
7.    Prolect  Degscrition.   The project would consist  of the  following
components, to be implemented over eighteen months:
(a)   three locust control campaigns over the period February/March 1994
to January 199S, using some 1.5 million liters of pesticides to
treat an estimated 1.5 million hectares of land, 9S percent of which
through aerial spraying, while the balance would be treated using
existing specially equipped trucks;
(b)   further strengthening national desert locust control capabilities by
increasing the existing stock of vehicles by an additional 50 four-
wheel drive vehicles, spare parts for the said vehicles as well as
for INPV's existing stock of trucks, 3 fork-lifts for handling
pesticide containers, 100 atomizer sprayers with spare parts
therefor, 80 manual pumps, laboratory equipment for pesticide
analysis, and health kits for the operators;
(c)   for prospection purposes, provision of small meteorological and
mobile telecommunication equipment, including air to ground
receivers and 10 hand-held Global Positioning Systems;
(d)   provision of short-term consultancy and technical documentation to
strengthen the capabilities of National Institute for Plant
Protection (INPV) in the safe handling, application and storage of
pesticides, and disposal of pesticides and pesticide containers; and
(e)   training  in  locust  prospection  methods,  pesticide  handling,
phytopharmacy and in pesticide-related environmental protection.
8.    The project would provide the necessary funds for pesticides, rental
of commercial aircraft especially designed for the spraying of pesticides,
equipment, vehicles, consultants and training.  The project's total cost is



- 3 -
estimated at about US$51 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$30 million (59 percent). The cost of pesticides (US$12.5 million) and of
the rental of commercial aircraft services (US$12.2 million) alone amounts to
about 80 percent of the foreign exchange needed, whereas vehicles and equipment
account for only 12 percent.   Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Algeria are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
9.    Proiect Imoleme1tation. The INPV within the Ministry of Agriculture would
have overall responsibility for the project. The three campaigns covered by the
project would be conducted in close collaboration with the PCC, created within
the INPV in 1988 and which has been reactivated to manage locust control
operations during the current plague situation. Other governmental agencies to
be associated with the project in an advisory role would include the National
Meteorological Services (ONM); the National Agency for the Protection of the
Environment (ANPE), which is responsible for monitoring industrial pollution, as
well as the impact of pesticide use on the environment throughout the country,
the National Agency for the Protection of Nature (ANN) in charge of Algeria's
national parks, and the toxicology center within the medical university center
of Bab-El-Oued to monitor the health condition of field operators. The President
of INPV, who also heads the PCC, reports directly to the Minister of Agriculture
and is responsible for defining the locust control strategy. The PCC has access
to an Interministerial Committee (CILA) which was created in 1968 for the purpose
of ensuring proper coordination among those ministries involved in locust
control.  Some 10 Wilayate Command Posts (PCW) likely to be affected by the
locusts have been reactivated at the regional level headed by their respective
Wali (governors).
10.   Procurement.  Procurement under the project would be in accordance with
Bank guidelines. Given the urgency of the response required and to ensure that
the necessary pesticides and rental aircraft services - which are available on
the world market - would be on site by the end of February 1994, exceptional
procurement procedures will be adopted. As a result, and in order to avoid
delays in advertising, a first campaign of pesticide and rental aircraft services
requirements up to equivalent respective amounts of about US$5 million and US$6
million will be procured according to Limited International Bidding (LIS)
procedures. This is also justified due to the fact that there are only a limited
number of suppliers of the particular goods or services needed. The balance of
the procurement of pesticides and rental aircraft services will be awarded
according to international Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. Items or groups
of items for vehicles and equipment estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$100,000 or less per contract, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to
US$500,000, will be procured through International Shopping (IS) on the basis of
comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers, from at
least two different countries eligible under the Guidelines, in accordance with
procedures acceptable to the Bank. The hiring of short-term consultants and
training estimated not to exceed the aggregate amount of US$150,000, will be
through direct contracting.
11.   Proiect Sustainabilitv.  The pesticides purchased under Loan 3017-AL are
properly stored, and the vehicles and equipment are well maintained. This is
important for a country far away from the infesting sources with a strategy based
on the preemptive treatment of locusts, including swarm possibly beyond its own
borders. Algeria is actively involved in the Maghreb Task Force that was created



in l988 to combat the previous plague and has teams presently on the ground in
both Mauritania and northern Mali. The means provided by the project would help
the country prevent and mitigate the impact of future locusts invasions. The
country is strongly committed to the monitoring and control of locusts as a
matter of economic necessity. The experience under the previous project has
shown that the Algerians are highly committed to adhering to international rules
regarding the preservation of the environment through the proper selection, use,
storage, and disposal of pesticides as well as the adoption of the necessary
safeguards to protect human health.
12.   Lessons Learned. The Project Completion Report for the first project which
was satisfactory, shows that during recessional periods, Algeria can keep the
locust situation under control with the means currently at its disposal.
However, should the country be invaded by a serious locust plague, it would once
again need to have recourse to external financing to cover the high costs of
rental aircraft services and pesticides.  The speed with which that project
became effective clearly demonstrates the GovernmentIs commitment to solving the
locust problem as a matter of national priority.
13.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The seriousness of the forecasted plague,
the crippling impact of inadequate action not just in Algeria but also in the
region, and the need for immediate mobilization of resources to combat the
problem amply justify Bank involvement in the proposed project. Algeria, which
is currently short of foreign currency to acquire urgently needed pesticides and
commercial aircraft services, is most vulnerable. Meanwhile, other donors are
focusing their assistance on the Sahelian countries. In addition to minimizing,
if not averting, economic disaster to some 12 million people likely to be
affected by the invasion, the project would further complement regional efforts
to provide a concerted approach to the advance monitoring and treatment of desert
locusts. Finally, the Bank's strength also resides in the speed with which the
project would be prepared.   The simple design and flexible procurement
arrangements envisaged should allow the Borrower to implement the proposed
project with the necessary urgency.
14.   Actions Actreed. The following points were agreed upon during negotiations:
(i) the pesticides to be used during the locust control campaigns will be
restricted to those approved by the Bank from among the list of pesticides for
locust control that meet the present standards of FAO/WHO; (ii) the pesticide
operators will be provided with protective clothing and equipment including
health kits, and will be adequately qualified and trained to handle pesticides;
(iii) the local populations in the areas to be sprayed with pesticides will be
given sufficient advance notice prior to any spraying taking place; (iv) the
labelling, packaging and storage of pesticide containers and the disposal of
pesticides and of pesticide containers will take place in accordance with
practices acceptable under the standards of FAO; (v) suitable pesticide effluent
disposal mechanisms will be made available to prevent environmental pollution and
pesticide leakages to ground water, including leakages resulting from the rinsing
of pesticide containers; (vi) the procurement of all goods will take place
according to Bank guidelines; (vii) a special account will be opened with the
Central Bank of Algeria; (viii) INPV will regularly monitor and evaluate progress
in the implementation of the project; and (ix) auditors acceptable to the Bank
will be used to audit the project accounts each fiscal year.
15.   Environmental Asnects.   The project which has been rated a IB" for
environmental purposes has been officially cleared by EMTEN on the basis that an



environmental analysis was carried out during appraisal. SNPV has signed a
contract with t'1e national pesticide formulation plant, ASMIDALI, for it to take
back any remaining stock of pesticides. Puture purchases of pesticides would be
in manageable quantities. Experts financed under the project would be consulted
on the measures to be adopted for the disposal of out-of-date pesticides and of
defective packaging. Maps showing all ecologically sensitive areas have been
prepared by both ANPE and AMN so a8 to minimize spraying of those areas to the
fullest extent possible. National and international NGOs would be informed of
the project prior to implementation and of the measures taken to minimize the
risks to humans and to the environment.  They will also be kept informed on a
routine basis during supervision missions.   In addition, national parks and
ecologically sensitive areas will be protected and their spraying averted to the
maximum extent possible.
16.   Benefits.  Total inaction could seriously cripple Algeria's still fragile
agricultural sector. It could further lower the standard of living of millions
of people. It could also prejudice the success of control programs by mainly
poor neighboring countries. Algeria must therefore continue to play a leading
regional role in locust control.
17.   Risks.  The main risk is that intervention in Algeria might not be enough
unless concrete and sufficient measures are undertaken by neighboring and other
countries sheltering gregarian locust populations. Steps are being taken to
minimize this risk. A meeting of Maghreb and Sahel countries took place on
September 27, 1993 and Algeria was asked to represent the region and liaise with
the international community. The ongoing consultations among the Maghreb and
Sahel countries are aimed at both strengthening regional cooperation and
improving coordination at the field level. Algeria has already 9 teams and 44
vehicles operating in Mauritania and Mali. The Bank is also in close contact
with the Governments of other potentially threatened countries and is monitoring
the control measures being taken. Even though the conditions are optimal for a
large invasion of locusts, the possibility does exist that a fortunate set of
natural occurrences could divert the swarms. This unlikely event would be of
benefit to all concerned.
18.  Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
