1. SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. COUNTRY BACKGROUND
1.1   Lesotho is a poor, mountainous and landlocked country, completely surrounded
by the Republic of South Africa (RSA). Lesotho has been historically described as a
"labor reserve" for South Africa's mines. About one half of those who are formally
employed work in the mines of South Africa and one third of gross national product
(GNP) is accounted for by migrant miners' remittances. However, formal employment
constitutes only 28 percent of total employment in the country, and 72 percent of the
labor force is engaged in agriculture and the informal sector at implicit wages that are
typically below the poverty line. The 1994 Poverty Assessment study shows continuing
high levels of relative poverty (50 percent) and unemployment, principally as a result of
the loss of employment opportunities for Basotho workers in South Africa's mining
industry. Those are a major cause for concern to the Government, which is committed to
poverty alleviation and has developed a strategy, the objectives of which are to: (i) create
jobs; and (ii) generate growth in the economy. A key aspect to achieve these objectives
relies on the shift of the public works program towards labor-based methods. Another
key aspect is to provide access to isolated areas poorly served by the current road network
through instating maintenance and improving road conditions to all-year round
serviceability.
1.2   Despite a growth of about 15 percent per year in the export sector, and 10% gross
domestic product (GDP) growth rates, no substantial unemployment reduction has
occurred. Agriculture, including animal husbandry, which contributes at least partially to
the income and employment of approximately 70 percent of all households, accounts for
only 15 percent of GDP. Manufacturing and construction continue to grow and make up
about 36 percent of GDP. There is significant new employment in garment
manufacturing for export, and good prospects for further employment growth in this
sector. Commerce and government, however, remain the largest contributors to GDP,
with Government services (including the commercial parastatals) accounting for almost
half of the production of this sector. Although equitable, broad-based growth of the
economy will depend on both the agricultural and industrial sectors, since agriculture has
limited capacity to absorb excess labor, growth will have to be led by the private
commercial and industrial sectors. Approximately one half of the government revenue
comes from Lesotho's share of import tariffs collected by the Southern Africa Custom
Union (SACU).



1.3    By the mid- 1980s, the Government of Lesotho (GOL) realized that its former
policy of aiming for economic self-sufficiency by following a parastatal-led, import-
substitution strategy was unsustainable. An alarming fiscal deficit induced the
Govermment to develop in 1988, with the assistance from the World Bank and the IMF, a
strategy aimed at stabilizing the economy. The main objectives of the structural
adjustment program were to strengthen fiscal discipline, diversify the country's export
base, and improve social services. Following a period of slow growth in real GDP in the
first half of the 1980s (averaging 1.7 percent a year), real GDP grew considerably
between 1988 to 1994, achieving an average annual growth rate of 8.5 percent. This
growth was due in large part to a 16 percent growth rate of manufacturing and
construction, including in particular activities within the Lesotho Highlands Water
Project (LHWP), which counterbalanced the effects of two drought years and a decline in
mineworkers remittances. In 1994, GNP per capita was US$700 in current Dollar terms.
In addition substantial progress has been made in controlling expenditures and putting in
place revenue enhancement measures. The fiscal deficit of 9 percent of GNP in 1988/89
was reversed to a small fiscal surplus by 1992/93. Currently, thc government is a net
repayer to the banking system, removing earlier concerns that bank financing would not
be available to the private sector.
1.4    However, during this period of stabilization, implementation of structural reforms
has been slow, in particular in civil service capacity-building, which threatens
achievements of the adjustment program. A fifth five-year development plan has been
elaborated for the years 1991/1996. Its four overarching objectives are: (i) economic
recovery and sustainable growth to provide the population with a better access to basic
services; (ii) creation of an enabling environment to facilitate the role of the private sector
in delivering services, with special reference to the development of a private construction
industry, and privatization or restructuring of public enterprises and parastatals; and (iii)
removal of capacity constraints in the public sector, and decentralization, which has
recently led to the first democratic election of Village District Councils (VDCs). The
recent three-year Policy Framework Paper, supported by an IMF-financed 12-month
stand-by arrangement, recommends to accelerate the creation of a better investmen.
climate for foreign capital, increase the pace of privatization, and not maintain fiscal
surpluses by under-investing in infrastructure and human capital.
1.5   The Government's infrastructure strategy focuses on poverty reduction and
employment creation through the expansion of labor-based public works, improving the
coverage and quality of basic services, increasing the role of the private sector in the
delivery of basic infrastructure services, privatizing public enterprises and parastatals, and
removing capacity constraints in the public sector. It emphasizes (i) increasing the role of
the private sector; (ii) capacity building and investment in human resources; and (iii)
improved cost recovery of services, and a better balanced and increased overall level of
recurrent and investment expenditures. Currently, the implementation of the
Govermment's infrastructure strategy is constrained by limited line ministerial capacity in
planning, accounting and management, and the excessive reliance on force account
arrangements for providing services. Civil service reform, and support to the

development of the private sector and privatization of those activities that can be best
performed by the private sector, are central to the improvement of the efficiency and
management of public utilities and services.
1.6   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Lesotho emphasizes the direct and
indirect poverty-reducing effects of expanding and improving rural and peri-urban
infrastructure, and increasing the share of civil works being carried out using labor-based
techniques. It supports (i) maintaining and strengthening structural reforms to create
employment and improve incomes; (ii) addressing capacity constraints in the public
sector through capacity building and investment in human resources, and involving
communities in the development and management of services; and (iii) capturing the
benefits of the LHWP, and in particular strengthening rural development through a
clearer and more transparent use of the Development Fund (into which the revenues of
the LHWP are being deposited. As a result of the 1994 Bank's Poverty Assessment
study, a poverty reduction action plan was elaborated jointly with the Government and
the Lesotho Council of NGOs. It stresses the need for a major expansion of labor-based
public works, including restoring or instating the serviceability of roads to provide isolated
areas with all-year round access. An improved and better balanced road network will
facilitate economic development and the extension of basic social services in the remote,
poor areas of the country. The Government has already acted on these recommendations,
and is currently executing a major new public works initiative financed from the Revenue
Fund of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) to the benefit of rural
communities, which have overwhelmingly chosen road infrastructure as priority
investments. The proposed operation would be an integral part of IDA's ongoing
assistance to GOL aimed at facilitating economic development and reducing poverty by
extending basic services and growth to isolated parts of the country, through financing key
parts of the National Road Program and ensuring the link between village-built roads and
the rest of the network. A key aspect of the proposed project is to rapidly increase the
institutional capacity and substantially accelerate private sector participation in road
activities, in order to effectively handle the substantially higher level of road activities.
B. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
1.7   Highly mountainous, with rugged terrain and wintery conditions in the Highlands,
Lesotho depends almost exclusively on privately-operated road transport for internal
transport. The country has no navigable rivers and no railway except for a short (2 kcm)
rail link operated by South Africa Railways from the South African border to Maseru.
Air transport by the local company Lesotho Airways accounts respectively for only
0.01% and 0.5% of freight and passenger transport. For external travel, Lesotho depends
almost entirely on RSA's well developed transport system. Because of Lesotho's high
proportion of migrant workers and low level of marketed domestic production, demand
for passenger transport is relatively high.
1.8   The present condition of the transport infrastructure is unbalanced as a result of
past investments in the transport sector in Lesotho, which have been oriented since 1967



- 4 -
towards the primary transit and import/export corridors of the lowlands serving the
emerging manufacturing sector along the border with the RSA. This has led to relative
neglect of the transport infrastructure to serve the transportation needs of the Lesotho
population and large segments of the domestic economy. Most traffic originates and ends
in the lowlands, and freight is 95% lowlands-based, with the exception of the route to the
LHWP dam and transfer tunnels sites. This, and limited budget resources, has meant that
Highlands have been little accounted for in the investment flow.
1.9   The great majority of road transport trips is made by private transport, and 75% of
passenger transport is by privately-owned public transport. The publicly-owned Lesotho
Freight and Bus Services Corporation (LFBSC) accounts for only 0.5% of total public
transport. Inadequate capacity and lack of accountability of responsible government
agencies (largely due to the high dependency on, and poor management of foreign
technical assistance which has prevented the country from successfully developing sound
institutions and retaining a cadre of skilled staff), poor cost recovery practices, and
inadequate regulations of transport services, have led to deterioration of the condition of
the sector.
1.10  Currently, fare levels are set by the Department of Transport and Traffic (DTT) of
the Ministry of Transport and Communication (MOTC), on the basis of average vehicle
operating costs (VOC) and utilization rates which are in fact not well known. This leads
to distortions in the pricing structure, aggravated by the significant differential margin
between lowlands and mountainous areas. They are, moreover, reviewed at irregular
intervals. There is a need for reforming the fare policy to provide for stable prices set on
a route by route basis, or better to leave fares to the market with an eventual passenger-
protecting fare cap (with a transparent direct subsidy to the most costly routes to the
isolated mountainous areas). A key issue is cost recovery of damages imposed onto roads
by traffic (i.e. users of the road network), hence the need for users being charged for the
costs of maintenance and rehabilitation.
1.11  The vehicle fleet is marked by a large percentage of vans and combies (about
60%) and a low percentage of trucks (10%) and buses (2.5%), and by the use of second-
hand vehicles from the RSA. Passenger transport operators are mainly single vehicle
operators (combies) and a few larger operators with up to 100 vehicles. LFBSC has been
restructured as part of the parastatal reform process, with the freight section of the
Corporation liquidated, and the bus section retained, although downsized, to serve remote
areas of the country. The main issues are cumbersome permits administration and
negative licensing by the Road Transport Board (RTB), which could be resolved by
granting a licensing authority to the DTT while focusing the Board role on regulating the
industry, and unregulated army and police vehicles used for paying passenger transport
with a de facto subsidy.
1.12  The existing road safety situation is poor. Lesotho's accident rate is ranking
among the highest by international standards, with a rate of fatalities per 10,000 vehicles
increasing from 105 in the late eighties to 130 in the most recent years. Police
enforcement with regard to moving traffic is generally complained about as unfair and



unreasonable. Road safety measures, either active or passive, are very uncoordinated,
due to the very meager resources actually spent and the fragmented responsibility
between MOTC, the Ministry of Works (MOW), and the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police.
1.13  Axle load surveys conducted as part of the 1994 National Transport Study (NTS)
show that multi-axle trucks account for the bulk of ESA km/year, and that about 40% of
those trucks exceeded the current 8.2 tons limit. There is currently no enforcement of
axle-load regulations, and the two permanent weighbridges near Maseru are not
monitored. Although the mobile weighscales operated by the RB are appropriate for
random checking, lay-bys are non-existent and surveys fairly unorganized. Another issue
concerns the difficulty of raising the axle-load (currently set at 8 tons) to a limit closer to
the recently adopted 13 tons limit in the RSA following the Southern Africa Transport
and Communications Commission (SATCC) recommendations. The NTS estimated that
road damage savings from setting the axle-load limit to a maximum of 10 tons would
more than offset additional transport costs, as most heavy traffic is limited to lowlands
corridors and access routes to LHWP sites.
1.14 GOL's Transport Sector Strategy, defined in the NTS, has four main objectives:
(i) to support improved access to communities, in particular those living in isolated rural
areas, and linking district towns between themselves; (ii) to implement adequate taxation
of transport services; (iii) to enforce traffic control and axle-load regulations; and (iv) to
strengthen institutional capacity. It emphasizes supporting:
(a)   reforming the policy and institutional environment, including: (i)
stimulating participation of the private sector in the sector; (ii) full cost
recovery (wherever possible) and adequate allowances for funding of
capital investments; and (iii) coordinating policy-making, planning and
usage of road transport;
(b) commencing the development of the institutional, organizational and
human resources capacity required to effectively plan for, and manage the
road transport sector;
(c)   removing the limitations that the present transport infrastucture services
place on economic activity, by investing in physical ifratucture
rehabilitation and maintenance, focusing investment on improved access
and increased transport services to mountain communities, and
implementing road works through methods which favor employment.
C. THE ROAD SECTOR
Adminitration of Roads and Maintenance Organization
1.15  Raponsibility for the management of the road network is divided between three
agencies: the Roads Branch (RB) and the Labor Construction Unit (LCU) of the Ministry
of Works (MOW), and the Civil Works Section (CWS) under the Ministry of Local



- 6 -
Govement (MLG).The RB has primary overall responsibility for the classified roads,
which are the most important and most heavily trafficked roads of the network, and
bridges. The LCU is responsible for upgrading earth roads to engineered standards, and
maintaining them using labor-based methods (involving light equipment such as
pedestrian rollers, water bowsers, tractors). The CWS has responsibility for the
construction and maintenance of earth tracks and one-lane earth roads. All works carried
out by CWS are labor-intensive (involving mostly labor and tools), and the roads or
tracks they construct are to a lower standard than LCU-built roads. The workers are paid
mainly through the Food for Work Program (FWP), topped with a cash incentive, which
has attracted a very high percentage of women (estimated at about 80% of the labor force
in this program). Roads are selected on the basis of populations choices and commitment
to provide labor. CWS' role also includes the construction of footbridges and clinics in
the country's isolated areas.
1.16 The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) is the parastatal
responsible for the LHWP, which includes the construction and operation of a series of
dams, hydropower plants, transfer tunnels and pump houses to transfer water to the Vaal
River Basin in the RSA. Incidental to these massive hydraulic works there has been, and
will continue to be, a need to construct and strengthen access roads to the dam sites.
Tlhus the LHDA, which is not a road agency, has de facto temporary responsibility for
certain road links, including the construction of minor village and district roads. It has
been agreed, and this is Government's policy, that maintenance responsibility for the
roads which are currently under the LHDA administration, should be devolved to the
Roads Branch. The larger issue of maintenance responsibility for different categories of
roads will be addressed under the Project.
1.17 The management of urban roads has long been a difficult responsibility and
financing issue. The experience with the only independent local government, Maseru
City Council (MCC), showed that limited local financial and technical capacity resulted
in poor maintenance of urban streets. The institutional arrangements and the nature of the
works to be undertaken in or around Maseru (and their financial implications) need to be
agreed upon by all stakeholders on the basis of the expected increase in truck traffic from
(i) the construction of the Mohale dam and other works under Phase 1B of the LHWP;
and (ii) traffic generated by the construction of a new bridge at the border in Maseru.
This issue requires to be tackled within the context of the current decentralization effort,
and will be partly addressed under this project through the rehabilitation of main corridor
routes around Maseru, and the eligibility of urban roads for financing from the Road
Fund on a cost-sharing basis.
1.18  The road management structure is split between two Ministries (MOW and
MLG), not counting LHDA (under the Ministry of Natural Resources) which has specific
objectives. The analysis of the organization charts for the RB and the current rural roads
organization (LCU and CWS) clearly shows that the road institutional structure is
uncoordinated, in particular with regard to planning/programming, and operations almost
fully independent. The present road classification system is less than ideal from a
functional point of view, and road management, due to its fragmentation between four



- 7 -
agencies and three Ministries, is hampered by unclear responsibilities over extensive parts
of the network and by the fact that a great many LCU and some RB roads have never
been gazetted. In addition, the classification and numbering of roads are inadequate to
the evolving situation of the road network, and in particular do not allow road agencies to
develop a framework to plan, design, construct and maintain their respective networks.
The RB, as per the Road Act, is the road authority for all roads in Lesotho, and other road
agencies are operating within a loose legal context. This has resulted in about 820 km of
rural roads not falling under any agency's responsibility, which means in practice that
these roads are not maintained, although CWS would have to take the responsibility.
Government has agreed with the proposal made in the NTS to conduct a functional
reclassification, and subsequent renumbering, of the network. In parallel, there is a need
to define mechanisms to register and transfer roads, which would require a revision of the
Road Act, which is no longer adequate and responsive to present requirements.
1.19  The RB and the LCU are organized as departments within the MOW, and are
subject to Public Service regulations. Employment conditions are far from being
competitive with those offered in the private sector or even parastatals. To address the
problems raised by the fragmentation of the sector, a proposal to regroup LCU and CWS
under a department of rural roads in MOW, and the restructuring of the RB with more
capacity in project supervision and procurement, has been made in the NTS. This
proposal does not account for the specificity of the CWS (work methods, payment,
community participation) and the need for better coordination and cooperation between
agencies. The project will aim to solve these organizational issues through the
restructuring of MOW and regrouping of all road agencies under its authority. An
amendment of the 1969 Road Act will be necessary to better reflect responsibilities.
1.20 The RB has under its wing a Road Construction Unit (RCU) and a Road
Improvement Unit (RIU), which operate in a very independent and almost contractual
way with separate budgets and accounts, as well as their own equipment and workshops.
These units are mainly carrying out all types of work activities on gravel roads, including
upgrading them to paved standards, and some minor periodic maintenance on paved
roads. Other RB force account units are responsible for routine maintenance. If the
maintenance situation is "acceptable" for the RB network, despite relatively high costs, in
that it is mainly carried out, much of the unpaved LCU and CWS network is not well
maintained. Regular routine maintenance on CWS and LCU roads has been so far given
low priority, and little contracting took place despite Government stated policy of
contracting out maintenance. Very little periodic maintenance activities are carried out
on gravel roads, with the result that only rehabilitation on LCU gravel roads, mainly
donor-funded, is undertaken.
1.21 The Government's Plant and Vehicle Pool System (PVPS), which is under the
administrative control of MOW and assumes ownership of all mobile plant and vehicles,
is in serious difficulty: (i) low productivity; (ii) large vehicle fleet with many
unserviceable items, and scattered plant of which about 50% is not operational; (iii) lack
of spare parts; (iv) poor management and accountability of the fuel services; (v) lack of
trained mechanics due to uncompetitive pay scales; and (vi) very few senior management



- 8 -
staff. This results in operational inefficiencies and high costs, although hire charges are
regularly revised with regard to those high costs. The policy to service all plant and
vehicle services through PVPS for a 2.5% service fee (plus an extra charge of 5% when
services are sub-contracted to the private sector) to cover administrative costs, is highly
cost ineffective. Its enforcement since last year can only result in PVPS being more
overburdened and performing its role even less efficiently and effectively, without
alleviating heavy reliance on private services and facilities, in particular, across the
border in RSA. The size of the government vehicle and plant fleet is in itself a powerful
incentive for local garages to expand facilities. The immediate objective should be to
introduce a degree of competition and restructure PVPS operations and management, and
do away with equipment and plant in line with the Government strategy to contract out
civil works, before PVPS privatization or leased management could take place. The RB
and LCU workshops are small units serving force account units, and could be restructured
in parallel with the restructuring of these force account units.
1.22 In addition to the inadequacy of maintenance funding (para. 1.37), road
infrastructure provision is hampered by poor budgetary planning and programming
procedures, including limited capacity within MOW, the lack of a monitoring/evaluation
and financial/fiscal performance control function, and weak project accounting. The
crucial task of annual programming is currently being developed in the RB, through a
comprehensive and operations-oriented, road network programming and maintenance
management tool (Planning Management and Maintenance System-PMMS). This would
provide a system flexible enough to define rolling plans and annual programs, pending
capacity to update the road data base and users costs. This system is currently being
extended to all parts of the network, and is expected to soon become available to all
concerned agencies.
1.23 Accounting and financial management capacity is inadequate in both the RB and
the LCU (mostly manual procedures, financial statements delayed and accounting records
not kept up to date, no recording of fixed assets, weak accounting and contract
monitoring of civil works, important control functions such as bank reconciliations not
carried out, and lack of information for control and monitoring progress). The only
significant exception concerns contracts financed under donor-funded projects, for which
accounting and monitoring procedures are gradually being put in place.
1.24 Lesotho has adopted the SATCC guidelines harmonizing standards and
specifications. However, there are no detailed design standards and standard
specifications for all the various road classes and bridges. The LCU prepared a "Design
Guidelines" handbook for low volume roads and a technical manual for labor-based
contractors hired under training programs. This was further supported within the
framework of the current IDA-financed Infrastructure Engineering Credit (IEP). In the
RB, design standards and standard specifications vary from one project to the other
depending on which consultants are contracted for design, which results in inconsistent
standards and, eventually higher costs when roads need to be engineered to higher
standards. The lack of complete design standards, standard specifications, and quality
control procedures, results in undue complexity for RB and LCU to properly monitor



- 9-
consultants carrying out road works design and supervision. The RB intends to continue
strengthening its Design Section, and design of rehabilitation works and surveys and bills
of quantities for periodic maintenance on the RB unpaved roads will be carried out in
house. However, the capacity for design of rehabilitation and upgrading works remains
currently weak in MOW, and the few available qualified engineers are needed to take
over more urgent tasks than engineering studies which can easily be carried out by
outside consultants, provided that clear design methods and reporting guidelines are set in
order to harmonize design and ensure comparability and consistency of feasibility and
design studies. No quality assurance plans are included in works contracts and there are
no specific quality control procedures, while field laboratories for material testing are
insufficient. There are neither environmental guidelines for assessing road works
impacts, except for those developed by LCU for low volume roads, nor any regulatory
measures for stricter emission standards.
The Network
1.25   The 5,200 km long national roads network is relatively extensive, particularly in
economically active areas. About 2,000 kIn, managed by the RB and LHDA, are public
("gazetted") roads. Almost all RB and LHDA paved roads are classified as primary
roads, while most RB and LCU gravel roads are classified as secondary and tertiary
roads. Most earth roads, as well as roads transferred from CWS to LCU for upgrading to
engineered standards, are unclassified. The road network is unbalanced in length and
condition, particularly in the eastern mountainous region of the country. The following
table shows the network managed by each road agency and surface type, including the
roads for which no agency takes responsibility:

1.26 The most recent data on the status of the classified network show that about 23%
is in good condition, 56% in fair condition, and 21% in poor condition or currently not
motorable on a regular basis. However, while most paved roads are in good condition
and very little in poor condition, less than 10% of gravel roads are in good condition. In
addition, 400/o of unpaved roads as a whole are in poor condition. Low-volume non
classified earth roads are mostly in poor condition, and most roads not surveyed would fall
within the poor category, which would result in 43% of all roads being in poor condition.

1.27 Many roads, in particular those located in the mountainous areas, can only be
traveled in the dry season, and even then only by four-wheel drive vehicles. As a result,
accessibility to isolated areas is limited, which restricts the availability of basic services for
remote communities, mainly located in the poorer mountainous areas of the country. The
network has started to deteriorate over the past five years, except in those areas servicing
the LHWP sites which have received special attention, and highly-trafficked lowlands
tunk routes, for a number of reasons, including: (a) lack of suitable transport sector
policies resulting in: (i) inadequate arrangements for recovering costs from providers and
users of transport services; (ii) inadequately planned and sequenced; and untimely
financing of maintenance in the past; (iii) inefficient planning of capital investments in a
sector where the prioritization of expenditures has been notably weak; and (iv) ineffective
use of the private sector; (b) inefficient institutional arrangements for carrying out
systematic maintenance and upgrading and rehabilitation works; and (c) lack of
implementation capacity evidenced in a high dependency on foreign technical assistance.
1.28 Vehicular traffic is currently fairly high on many unpaved roads of the network,
and traffic grew on average over the period 1988 to 1992 by an annual rate of 6.5%. The
following table summarizes road traffic per category of roads (as per the NTS, which has

Human Resources and Implementation Capacity
1.29 The MOW has had constant difficulty in attracting and retaining engineers,
technical officers and administrators, due to lack of career prospects and more attractive
employment conditions being offered by the private sector or even parastatals. These
unfavorable conditions are prejudicial to staff morale and their attitude to learning new
operating procedures. This has resulted in acute staff shortages, short assignment
periods, and constant replacements that have not allowed the development of the
necessary skills. Both RB and LCU suffer, therefore, from a lack of appropriately
qualified and experienced staff in complex project design or review, procurement and
day-to-day project management procedures, and supervision. The many force account
units use management resources, which could be better employed for such important
tasks as described above.
1.30  The rate of staff attrition was very high in the early 90's, but has slowed down
somewhat during the last couple of years. However, the attractiveness of the RSA market
is higher than ever, and the plans to decentralize government by creating local councils
could cause the attrition rate to increase again in the near future, as the new councils
would need technical expertise and could be able to offer more attractive employment
conditions than is presently possible for RB and LCU as branches of MOW. In an
attempt to stop the drain, Government has favored engineers and technical officers with
salary scales among the best within the public service, discretionary "retention"
allowances and other fringe benefits. RB and LCU have, however, failed to develop a
long-term strategy to deal with the staffing issue, largely as a result of the perennial use
of foreign technical assistance in line management positions (about a third of the
engineers in LCU, and half of those in RB, are still expatriates), while MOW staff went
on long-term training overseas, only to join the brain drain from the public to the private
sector. This has been particularly acute in the engineering area, where foreign technical
assistance has been considerable and regular for years. The IEP-financed support has
however enabled some capacity building to take place in the areas of planning and
programming.
1.31  The finance sections in RB and LCU report operationally to the Chief Engineer
and are accountable to the Principal Secretary of the MOW, although seconded from the
Accountant General's Office in the Ministry of Finance. Movement of staff is done in
consultation with the line Ministry, but is characterized by high staff turnover, and lack of
continuity. Many of the staff, who have basic secondary education and no formal
accountancy training, have, however, some experience in Government accounting.
1.32 An organization being responsible for the maintenance and administration of a
road network cannot operate effectively and efficiently when it is constantly understaffed
(with a significant number of vacant technical posts), has frequently to substitute newly
graduated staff under bonding for trained staff who have left, employ substantial numbers
of expatriates, and cannot retain staff due to inefficient bonding arrangements. Although
employment conditions for engineers and technical officers have been improved as much
as is possible within the civil service regulations, MOW road agencies still do not have



- 12 -
the full capacity to handle project accounting and management and lack capacity in key
functions, and cannot therefore cope effectively with the implementation of the project.
This dual (retaining staff and staff capacity) constraint will be dealt with under the project
through a number of measures. The capacity issue cannot, however, be solely addressed
through direct capacity building actions, and it will also require regulatory reform and
institutional development.
The Construction Industry
1.33  The construction industry in Lesotho is largely underdeveloped. Despite some
recognition by Government of the potential employment impact of public works,
implementation is slow, largely due to budgetary constraints. In addition to shortfalls of
financial resources to contract out road works, the shortage of skilled managerial and
supervisory staff within the road agencies has hampered implementation.
1.34 The establishment of a Local Road Construction Industry (LRCI) has started
under the IEP, focusing on small labor-based contractors carrying out maintenance and
minor rehabilitation works for the LCU. However, due to the nature of the contracts
which are currently directly contracted out on the basis of LCU force account unit prices,
LCU has limited experience in the evaluation and negotiation of contracts, and needs to
strengthen its supervision and quality control of the contractors' work and conduct more
regular site inspections. The RB possesses previous experience in contract management
and administration, as it has used foreign consultants and contractors for a good part of the
periodic maintenance, rehabilitation, and major road construction and upgrading of its
paved road network. However, supervision of the subsequent works contracts have in most
cases been taken care of by consultants. The RB has not yet proceeded very far with the
planned implementation of road maintenance by local contractors (4 untrained truckers for
small periodic maintenance contracts on gravel roads), and does not have a firm plan for the
training and use of small-scale labor-based contractors for simple routine maintenance of
gravel and paved roads. Overall, these new contractors have no technical staff on site when
their owners are not there themselves. The RB and LCU supervision staff usually find no
responsible contractor technical staff when inspecting the work sites.
1.35  Some small local contractors have been unable to obtain Bank guarantees, which
will create difficulties when recently trained contractors will enter the bidding process.
The lack of adapted standard documents for small-scale contractors in the RB is one
constraint to their use by this agency, although those in use by LCU could easily be
adapted. Payment procedures for local contractors, developed under the IEP, have been
so far effective. However, increasingly larger numbers of contracts could create
bottlenecks in the control and payment of certificates, which would create a risk to the
sustainability of emerging contractors which are usually low on cash and not able to
withstand long delays of payment. Moreover, delays in equipment repairs are common as
a consequence of both cash flow problems of the contractors when servicing their
equipment in private garages, or the inefficiency of PVPS when using hired PVPS
equipment.



- 13 -
1.36  More emphasis on, and greater cooperation, with the private sector is needed to
alleviate these bottlenecks. The next step in the promotion of the industry would be for
GOL to create market incentives, basically by providing a regular flow of works,
simplifying bidding procedures and provision of securities, and paying quickly. The
development and implementation by the RB of routine maintenance activities through
contracting is necessary to help create the competitive market, whereby qualified
contractors would gradually develop into medium size firms able to take on more complex
road works. In order to achieve the creation of a local market, GOL ought to eliminate
those force account units that are redundant and inefficient, and would have to
restructure, commercialize and, where possible, privatize selected units.
Financing and Expenditures
1.37 All road expenditures are paid out from the GOL budget, eventually topped up by
donors funding. Although capital investments, which are mainly donor-funded, vary
from one year to another, road expenditures by MOW represented 85% of the 95 million
Maloti transport sector capital expenditures (themselves amounting to about 28.5% of
total capital investments for the 1993/1994 fiscal year, excluding the Lesotho Highlands
Water Project): 66.5 million Maloti were devoted to RB, while LCU accounted for only
12 million. This clearly shows the strong bias in capital budget allocations towards major
roads mainly located in the Lowlands. Road infrastructure represented 80% of the 55
million Maloti transport sector recurrent budget (itself amounting to about 10% of the
total GOL recurrent budget for the same fiscal year). This illustrates the unbalance
between investment and maintenance, with the result that funding matches less and less
the increasing maintenance requirements brought upon MOW. Although the RB budget
falls somewhat short of planned expenditures, it is by and large adequate to finance
maintenance (36 million Maloti in FY 1993/1994). The LCU budget (8 million in FY
1993/1994, or a mere 0.6% of total GOL recurrent expenditures, with about half of it
devoted to maintenance) is both inadequate in planned and actual expenditures, and has
been very erratic over the past years, as budgetary constraints result primarily in cutting
maintenance funds for rural roads. For its part, CWS had estimated recurrent and
investment budgets of respectively 4.2 and 3.3 million under MHA.
1.38  This unbalanced and low overall level of recurrent expenditures falls short of the
necessary funding to meet maintenance requirements, which has resulted in an increasing
degradation of roads, and increasing impassability of roads to some communities in the
mountainous parts of the country, and particularly in the Highlands. Moreover, LCU has
been upgrading and constructing gravel roads in the last 10 to 15 years (about 100 kms
per year recently), its network has kept expanding, while maintenance has become less
and less adequate due to capacity and budgetary constraints, which has resulted in an
urgent need to rehabilitate them. Taking these considerations into account, the emphasis
of any development program in the sector should be first and foremost on maintenance
and rehabilitation. Upgrading of selected roads should be only considered once recurrent
financing of maintenance and rehabilitation requirements is ensured and sufficient, and
priority for upgrading works should be given to regularly impassable roads. Except for a



- 14 -
few limited cases, new capital investments are neither economically viable, nor required
by network considerations, and the bulk of road construction activities should be carried
out in rural areas, using the Development Fund and project resources, to benefit village
communities on the basis of the CAS-supported Government poverty reduction strategy.
1.39 Government revenues from the road transport sector total about Maloti 89.5
million per annum (from 1994 figures), mainly comprising of about 84 million, paid out
to the Ministry of Finance-MOF, from: (i) returns from the Southern Africa Customs
Union-SACU revenue pool and the General Sales Tax-GST on vehicles and tires, and
fuel on vehicles and tires, and fuel totaling Maloti 49.1 million; and (ii) fuel taxes (oil
impost and equalization fund) amounting to Maloti 35 million. The balance comes from
various fees directly collected by DTT, including motor vehicle licensing and registration
fees (estimated at Maloti 2.5 million per year on the basis of a first registration fee
ranging from 100 Maloti to 1,080 Maloti and an annual fee ranging from 30 Maloti to
920 Maloti), and Road Traffic Administration fees of about 3 million Maloti (0.9 million
from drivers' licensing, 1.6 million from road transport fees, 0.2 million each from
vehicle inspection and plates issuance fees). There are currently no toll charges, but
MOF raises road toll/border fees of about Maloti 1.7 million, and Short-Term
Permits/Transport Fees (SACU Infrastructure Recovery Charge) on heavy vehicles
account for about Maloti 1 million.
1.40 Fuel consumption in million liter per year was estimated by the NTS at 74,
corrected to 88.4 to account for consumption in urban areas and the RSA. The
breakdown between petrol and diesel fuel consumption is estimated at respectively 58.5
and 29.9 million liters, including 5.8 and 3 million tax-free for GOL use. This is a source
of abuse, and the exemption status should be abolished. Current fuel taxes are as follows
(the Excise Duty and the Equalization Fund revenues are paid out to the SACU pool,
which holds these monies in trust):
Current Fuel Taxes
1994 figures                 Petrol fuel     Diesel fuel    Total revenues
(lisente per liter)  (lisente per liter)  (million Maloti)
Oil levy (impost)              43              37              32.6
Equalization Fund               3               3               2.4
SACU (including Excise Duty)    7.95 (4)        8.25 (4)        7.1
GST(10% of wholesale price)    13.9            13.5            10.8
TOTAL                                                          52.9
1.41   The analysis of Vehicle Operating Costs (VOCs) versus variable maintenance
costs shows that heavy trucks are undercharged, hence the need for implementing a more
progressive licensing fee to better account for damages (the recent NTS and SATCC
proposals are to dramatically increase heavy trucks annual license fees from the current
low 900 Maloti per year figure). However, such measures could fall short of raising
enough revenues for road maintenance and rehabilitation, and do not allow for a
transparent and full cost recovery of all damages imposed by traffic to the network, which
would imply that users be charged for the full costs of maintenance and rehabilitation.
The GST being a general revenue, equity and efficiency concerns suggest a fuel levy (as a



- 15 -
proxy for distance, and hence damages caused to roads), calculated in such a way as to
limit fuel prices with respect to those in the neighboring RSA in order to avoid evasion.
In addition, maintenance is currently being revisited to ensure the timely and stable flow
of funds to road maintenance and rehabilitation.
Road Sector Development Strategy
1.42 An improved roads sector has a large facilitating impact on the development of
the productive base that is essential to growth and a balanced economic development in
the medium-term. The road sector strategy also constitutes an essential aspect of GOL
development strategy of poverty alleviation, by providing employment throughout the
country, based on the maximum use of labor-based methods to carry out road
rehabilitation and maintenance works, and the development of a private construction
industry. The Strategic Economic Options Report (SEOR), and other initiatives at the
transport sector level (National Transport Policy, Roads Sector Policy) gave momentum
to the policy-making process and identification of the key issues faced by the road sector:
(i) financial (inadequate cost recovery, low overall level of recurrent and investment
budgets, and biased allocation of expenditures to the different categories of the road
network); (ii) operational (insufficiently efficient force account units, undeveloped
construction industry, limited implementation capacity in MOW); and (iii) institutional
(fragmented structure in too many road agencies, limited planning, programming and
fmancing capacity at the central government level, lack of a comprehensive and
coordinated management of the network).
1.43  The Government is currently focusing on strengthening various implementing
agencies (and their policy environments) for the delivery of infrastructure services,
focusing on provision of infrastructure to: (i) promote economic growth through the
private sector and (ii) reduce poverty and facilitate access to basic and essential services.
Government's road transport policy addresses the financial, operational and institutional
issues by primarily focusing on: (i) improving the performance of administrative bodies,
developing human resources management and career development, and reforming
operating procedures; (ii) revisiting budget expenditures; and (iii) improving the road
transport regulatory framework. The policy goals for the road sector are: (i) to increase
the role of the private sector in road works through the implementation of a sustainable
maintenance system based on the development of small contractors; (ii) to involve
communities in the decision-making and financing process relating to rural roads; (iii) to
improve the efficiency and implementation capacity of MOW; and (iv) to better plan and
program road works.
1.44 Long-term development will require (i) the continued and successful
implementation of a comprehensive manpower development plan; (ii) improvements in
continuous education to ensure that long-term staffing needs are met; and (iii) changes in
GOL's personnel and pay policies. While the last point is a general civil service reforn
issue, QOL is committed to developing a strategy to retain qualified staff in RB and LCU,
and to ensure an environment that allows road agencies to operate on a commercial basis.



- 16 -
One option under consideration is the establishment of a more autonomous Roads
Authority in Lesotho, independently financed through user charges, and focusing on tasks
which should remain in Government's hands (design, standards and technical
specifications, works contracting process, supervision of works and quality control,
financial management). This would introduce more "commercial" management into the
roads sector, and strengthen the capacity to retain qualified staff.
D. LESSONS FROM PREvIOuS BANK GROUP PROJECTS
1.45  There have been four Bank Group road projects in Lesotho. The First Highway
Project (Credit 82-BL, US$4.1 million, 1966) and the Second Highway Project (Credit
619-LSO, US$5.5 million, 1976) provided for the construction of main roads. The
second project also assisted in establishing the LCU on a pilot basis, which turned out to
be successful in establishing alternative work methods suitable for low-traffic roads. The
Third Highway Project (Credit 884-LSO, US$9.0 million, 1979) helped establish one
equipment-intensive and two labor-intensive regravelling brigades and regional offices of
the RB, and equip the Plant and Vehicle Pool Services (PVPS) regional workshops. The
Fourth Highway Project (Credit 1481-LSO, US$15.2 million, 1984) assisted in
strengthening labor-intensive brigades, and provided technical assistance for PVPS.
However, maintenance continued to be hampered by the lack of sustained operational and
institutional capacity of the road agencies, largely as a result of the failure to retain
engineers, and lack of enforcement of axle-load control. One main lesson is that, after
three decades of supporting the development and restructuring of force account units,
sustainability had not been achieved due to the remaining inefficiencies in operations
which could be best performed by the private sector.
1.46 Implementation of the road sector development strategy commenced with the
Infrastructure Engineering Project-IEP (Cr. 2400-LSO, US$12.3 million, 1992) due to
close on June 30, 1996, which focused on capacity building. Progress has been achieved
in establishing procedures in the Implementing Agencies for allocating available funds
for investment and maintenance in line with economic criteria, starting to develop a local
labor-based road construction industry, initiating a training program for the RB,
developing the administrative and financial management capacity of agencies providing
infrastructure services, and designing planning and programming systems, and limited
feasibility studies.
1.47 The main findings and lessons learned from the previous highway projects and the
IEP are that, although accomplishments of both the equipment and labor-intensive
brigades involved in the regravelling and upgrading operations of unpaved roads were
commendable, it is not possible to sustain the network developed by the brigades with the
current institutional structure, budgetary constraints, and departmental units such as
PVPS remaining inefficient. It was also seen that the implementation capacity of the
roads agencies remains hampered by the loss of engineers trained under the projects to
the private sector and neighboring countries, despite Government's attempts to provide



- 17 -
trained engineers with incentives to remain in the public sector. This constitutes a clear
rationale for a drastic reorganization of MOW.
1.48  Lessons from the Poverty Assessment (Report No. 13171 -LS) led to a special
emphasis on poverty alleviation through expanding labor-based road works and labor-
intensive self-targeted earth tracks and footbridges, the latter being achieved by
decentralizing planning and management to the local level of Government with
community participation (paras. 4.13 and 4.14).
1.49 Lessons learned from similar projects in the rest of Africa, in particular from the
Tanzania Integrated Roads Project-IRP (Credit No. 2149-Tan) and Mozambique Roads
and Coastal Shipping Project-ROCS II (Credit No 2599-MOZ), have been given full
consideration in the design of this project, including: (i) using an integrated sector
approach; (ii) carefully phasing policy reforms and investments; (iii) stimulating the
development of a local contracting industry through the provision of suitably packaged
works; (iv) resolving early in the project maintenance funding and organizational issues;
and (v) emphasizing capacity-building by using short-term TA and local consultants, and
ensuring transfer of skills to identified counterparts.
1.50 The Road Maintenance Initiative (RMI) has drawn a number of lessons with
respect to the establishment of sustainable road maintenance in Africa which are reflected
in the policy initiatives to be undertaken under the project, especially those related to
financing and management of the road sector.

2. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
2.1   The primary objectives of the project are to support both continued economic
growth and the Government's poverty reduction strategy through: (i) developing the
Government capacity to regularly maintain the whole classified road network by the year
2000, and upgrade priority roads to improved serviceability standards; (ii) improving
access to isolated areas and basic services in district centers by facilitating road traffic,
and lowering transport costs; (iii) further developing the emerging private local road
construction and maintenance industry, using mainly labor-based methods to generate
productive employment; and (iv) strengthening the planning, implementation and
management capacity of the Road Sector agencies, through policy and institutional reforms
and capacity building support.
B. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT
2.2   One of the specific objectives of the World Bank and IMF-supported adjustment
program was to link budgetary management to economic planning which includes
planning for public investments and associated operational and maintenance
expenditures. Despite progress, this is still needed for the infrastructure sector where the
provision of funds for maintenance and operations has not been sufficient to secure the
expected flow of benefits from investments made. The project would support the
adjustment program and facilitate economic growth by removing road transport sector
bottlenecks, improving access, expanding manpower development, encompassing more
private contractors, and promoting efficient resource allocation in the road sector where
prioritization of expenditures has been notably weak.
2.3   The Project would be an integral part of IDA's on-going assistance to GOL, which
aims at facilitating economic development and reducing poverty (para. 1.6). It will focus
on: (i) implementing regulatory and institutional reforms and strengthening road
agencies' implementation capacity; (ii) financing priority civil works to ensure
sustainability in the road sector; and (iii) coordinating donor participation in the road
sector. IDA will support a program of civil works to improve road conditions and
address the objectives of the Government 5-year road sector strategy. IDA participation
in the project would help to: (i) ensure that the road works program is linked to proposed
policy changes; (ii) manpower development efforts are expanded; and (iii) adequate
resource allocation to road infrastructure is implemented; and (iii) anticipated
improvements in policy formulation and implementation, and capacity-building serve as



- 19-
reference points for pacing the investment program. The project would also build on
ongoing initiatives of the Government, supported by the Bank and other donors, and
provide the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these efforts.
2.4  IDA participation in the project would help to ensure that it is implemented in line
with the overarching goal of sustainable poverty alleviation. The project is designed to
assist a large proportion of poor people (paras 4.11 to 4.13), through: (i) increased access
to markets and services, at lower costs, in particular for people living in poorer
mountainous districts having low access to services and being poorly served by the
current road network; (ii) generation of 2 million person days of work throughout the
country over the five years, mainly through the labor-based employment-generating civil
works program; (iii) support the promotion of growth of the Lesotho economy; and (iv)
resumption of maintenance on those parts of the network (in relatively poorer rural areas)
which have been neglected in the past. The project would also support the cross-cutting
policy goals of the CAS through: (i) increasing the role of local contractors; (ii)
strengthening community ownership through broader participation in the road selection
mechanism and maintenance works; and (iii) improving the efficiency of management
and planning of the road sector through capacity building and human resource
development.
2.5   The Bank's Infrastructure portfolio in Lesotho comprises two projects, Phase IA
of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP IA), and the Lesotho Infrastructure
Engineering Project (IEP). The Project will follow upon the IEP which initiated
participation of the private sector in road works, the implementation of planning and
programming procedures, and improved financial and managerial capacity in MOW.
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.6   This project finances three major components over the July 1996 to March 2001
period: (i) a civil works program focusing on maintenance, and including the
rehabilitation of sections of the RB and LCU network, and selected upgrading of selected
priority roads; (ii) design engineering and supervision services in support of the program;
and (iii) sector institutional reform and capacity building, including logistical support to
MOW. Details are included in the Implementation Manual (para. 3.4).
Project Strategy
2.7   The proposed project would aim at assisting Government to implement its
development strategy and ensure that national objectives are achieved, and coordinating
donors' involvement in the sector within a common policy reform, institutional
strengthening, and investment programming framework agreed upon with Government
(through discrete parallel-financed sub-projects). The proposed project would follow an
approach that phases the policy reform and institutional development initiatives with
existing capacity, while supporting the development of the latter, and defines a rolling
five-year country-wide road investment program, the pace of which would be deternined



- 20 -
by progress with institutional and policy reforms and improved Government financial and
implementation capacity.
2.8   Because of uncertainties associated with Government financial and operational
capacity to fuly maintain the road network, and to implement key policy reforms, the
project will focus, during the first two years, on: (i) establishing a sustainable
maintenance system, while mainly financing road rehabilitation (a few rehabilitation
works would still be carried out during the third year); (ii) restructuring the institutional
environment of MOW; and (iii) supporting capacity building. The following three years
would focus on increased maintenance activities and road upgrading, once the existing
network has been almost fuilly rehabilitated, and on the pursuit of institutional
development. A major mid-term review of implementation and institutional progress, to
be held after two years of project implementation, will assess physical, financial and
institutional progress, and refine the size of the program for the following three years
(para. 3.6). Civil works under the project constitute a 5-year rolling program, whereby,
the details of each year's program, in particular the upgrading of CWS roads, will be
agreed annually.
2.9   The 5-year civil works program (about US$ 93.5 million, or 84% of project base
costs) would include: (i) regular routine and periodic maintenance, estimated to cost
respectively about US$24.5 million each; (ii) rehabilitating roads in poor condition or in
need of strengthening, estimated to cost about US$13.5 million; and (iii) upgrading
selected priority roads costing about US$31 million. Engineering services (assessment of
bridges and urban roads, detailed design for major road works, and supervision of civil
works) account for about US$4 million (about 4% of project base costs). The
institutional reform and capacity building component (about US$14.5 million or 13% of
project base costs) includes short-term support and limited long-term technical assistance
for policy and management issues, refurbishing the LCU training center at Teyateyaneng,
initiating road safety counter measures, and logistical assistance to road agencies
(laboratory and training equipment, office equipment and supervision vehicles).
Civil Works Program
2.10 Given the unbalanced condition of the road network, the civil works program is
based on an optimum balance between: (i) bringing the network back under regular and
sustainable routine maintenance, in order to avoid further deterioration by protecting the
structure of roads, through strengthening maintenance systems and spreading
maintenance funds more widely on secondary and tertiary gravel roads which have been
neglected, and including bridges repair where necessary; (ii) rehabilitating gravel roads to
eliminate the backlog of deferred periodic maintenance before further deterioration takes
place, strengthening key corridor routes with expected significant increases in traffic, and
starting road safety improvements; and (iii) gradually upgrading low traffic volume roads
to provide all-weather all-year round access to isolated mountainous areas, and a few
selected RB and LCU strategic links. The strategy aims at gradually restoring all
classified roads to good and fair condition within 5 years (compared to above 90% of the



- 21 -
paved network and about 60% of the unpaved network at present). The most urgent part
of the program concerns urgent protective routine and periodic maintenance, which will
require a special operational, organizational and financial effort for the lowest tier of rural
roads managed by CWS, and to some extent for LCU gravel roads.
2.11  To support Government's effort to extend maintenance activities, IDA will assist
with financing periodic maintenance of LCU and CWS roads on a decreasing basis (para.
2.46). Road rehabilitation and upgrading works have been phased in such a way that the
increase in subsequent maintenance funding requirements be gradual. Upgrading to
engineered gravel standards of CWS roads by LCU is based on "poverty alleviation and
community participation" criteria (including population preferences, and population
density) agreed with Government (para. 4.3). The CWS roads upgrading program will be
prepared by LCU and reviewed by IDA annually with regard to the FWP program and the
use of the LHWP Development Fund proceeds to match implementation and financial
capacity. A network rationale has been used to package the RB and LCU rehabilitation
and upgrading works to ensure that entire links, rather than only limited road sections, are
brought to good condition. The LHDA plan for upgrading the St. Michael's to Thaba-
Tseka road and other minor links has been incorporated into the definition of the
rehabilitation and upgrading program. The program has been developed not only taking
into account priorities, but also considering the implementation and supervision capacity
of RB and LCU, assessing a reasonable growth rate of local contractors to be able to
cover all maintenance requirements by the year 2001, and funding availability (local and
donor, recurrent and capital).
2.12  The civil works program includes: (i) the gradual implementation of routine
maintenance on the whole classified network, and periodic maintenance on all sections of
the classified network in good or fair condition; (ii) the rehabilitation of gravel road
sections in poor condition that have deteriorated past the point of maintenance to as-built,
maintainable standards, and the strengthening (rehabilitating to provide a reasonable
riding surface) of those RB essential/priority road assets (mostly heavily-trafficked trunk
roads around Maseru); and (iii) the upgrading of key selected rural earth and gravel roads
to all-weather standards (CWS roads from earth to 3.5-meter engineered gravel standards
by the LCU), the upgrading of four LCU roads from gravel to engineered 5-meter gravel
standards by the RB, and the upgrading of four key RB unpaved trunk road sections from
gravel to paved standards (referred to in the Development Credit Agreement-DCA as
paving). Annex A provides the details of the road program. The table below summarizes
the estimated 5-year civil works program:

Unit costs indicated are average for the three terrain categories: lowlands, hilly,
mountainous. The implementation strategy is based on contracting out maintenance
activities increasingly to local contractors, using labor-based methods whenever possible,
while gradually doing away with force account operations (para. 2.24). A complete
definition of what are routine and periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading
activities, and cost figures for each type of roads are included in the Implementation
Manual.
2.14  Maintenance activities account for about 44 % of project base costs. The
minimal-cost rehabilitation program (about 12% of project base costs) includes
strengthening 57 km of priority paved roads (US$8.5 million), 134 km of RB unpaved
roads (US$2.5 million), and 196 km of LCU roads (US$2.5 million). The upgrading
program of about US$3 1.0 million (about 28% of project base costs) covers the priority
upgrading to engineered gravel standards of about 390 km of CWS roads (US$12.0
million), and selected upgrading to RB engineered gravel standards of 42 km of LCU
roads by the RB (US$3.0 million), and about 90 km of gravel roads to be upgraded to
paved standards (US$16.0 million).
2.15 In addition, a 1994-1999 US$7.5 million program of labor-intensive works to
construct and maintain tracks and feeder earth roads, aimed at injecting cash into the
communities of all districts, is currently being carried out by CWS with support from the
donor-funded FWP (Food for Work Program) and cash contribution from the GOL
budget. In order to widen the potential employment impact of civil works, the CWS
program gives local governments a key role in selecting and carrying out local works.
The program for the period 1996-1999 covers constructing about 85 km of additional
roads, upgrading 270 km of tertiary roads and tracks, and an estimated 490 km of
periodic maintenance and 3,450 km of routine maintenance (or about 1,100 km per year).
These four categories of works, although mixed in actual implementation, are already
fully funded for the remaining 1996-1999 period for respective amounts of US$1.1, 2.0,
1.3, and 1.0 million from the FWP food incentive program, and US$0.6, 1.0, 0.7, and 0.5
million from the GOL-funded cash contribution program. An additional culverts and
footbridges program accounts for a total of US$1.6 million. These cost figures are not
accounted for in the project costing. However, the implementation of the FWP program,
and the recently started LHWP Development Fund program to upgrade and construct
village roads on a purely cash payment basis, bear an impact on the organization, mode of
operations and funding requirements of maintenance activities. In particular, the
mechanisms to transfer the responsibility of CWS "high-volume" roads to LCU, issues
involved in regrouping CWS with other road agencies under MOW, the opportunity to
maintain the food for work basis of the FWP program, and the consistency of criteria
used in selecting roads and the various civil works programs will be reviewed under the
project's Institutional Reform sub-component (para. 2.18).



- 24 -
2.16 LHDA-built roads maintenance responsibility will be addressed under the project,
with an action plan to enforce the current Government's policy to transfer responsibility
to MOW in 1996, under conditions to be determined as a result of the overall
restructuring of road management responsibilities (paras 2.21 (b) (iii) and 2.26). The
evaluation of road maintenance funding requirements accounts for the maintenance of
these LHDA-built roads under the RB category.
Engineering Services
2.17  The project would also include engineering services in support of the civil works
program worth about US$4.0 million (4% of project base costs) comprising: (i) feasibility
and detail design studies for upgrading RB gravel roads to paved standards, and design
for upgrading LCU roads to engineered gravel standards, for an estimated amount of
US$1.2 million; (ii) engineering studies for rehabilitation works of LCU roads and RB
paved roads, for an estimated amount of US$0.3 million; (iii) bridge assessment and
engineering studies for urban roads, for an estimated amount of US$0.4 million; (iv)
design and supervision of the extension of the Teyateyaneng LCU training center by a
local consulting firm; and (v) supervision services for major upgrading and rehabilitation
works which are to be carried out by foreign contractors, for an estimated amount of
US$2.0 million. Feasibility and detail design studies for rehabilitating and upgrading RB
unpaved roads (except upgrading to paved standards) will be carried out in-house, as well
as engineering studies for upgrading by LCU of CWS earth roads to gravel standards.
Surveys of exact road condition rather than complete feasibility studies will be carried out
in-house for periodic maintenance. Local engineering firms could be used in studies for
LCU rehabilitation contracts, and later for supervision of works as their capacity
increases. External services will be procured through short-term technical assistance
(estimated at 178 staff-months for engineering studies, and 140 staff-months for
supervision). The EU would finance the detail design and supervision of the three LCU
roads to be upgraded to paved standards that it intends to finance.
Institutional Reform and Capacity Building
2.18 The Institutional Reform and Capacity Building component (US$14.5 million, or
about 13% of project base costs) includes two sub-components and logistical support: (i)
an Institutional Reform sub-component to assist Government in implementing key
regulatory and policy reforms within the framework of its road sector policy, including in
particular restructuring the institutional environment of MOW, and establishing
sustainable road financing mechanisms with the objective of full Government financing
of maintenance and rehabilitation; (ii) a Capacity Building sub-component aimed at
developing the organizational and implementation capacity of the road agencies initiated
under the IEP, through strengthening competencies, and implementing human resources
management and training actions; and (iii) logistical support to RB and LCU.
2.19 The comprehensive institutional reform and capacity building component has
been designed consistently with GOL's road sector policy, and is detailed in the



- 25 -
Implementation Manual. It is summarized in the Government's Letter of Sector Policy
(LSP) setting the policy reforms to be implemented under the project. The LSP signed by
the Minister of Finance has been submitted to IDA before Board presentation (para. 5.3),
and is attached in Annex B. The project will be implemented according to the LSP. In
addition, A Road Fund and a Road Board have also been established (Annex C) before
presentation to the Board (para. 5.3). This component has been designed to address both:
(i) the need for key policy reforms aimed at facilitating operations in the road sector; and
(ii) the implementation capacity constraint, mainly linked to the difficulty to retain qualified
staff and the need for a sustainable long-term development strategy (para. 1.44). It is,
therefore, based on concurrent and mutually reinforcing actions detailed below.
2.20 Given the capacity limitations in MOW, technical assistance is required to ensure
implementation of the project and to avoid overloading management. However, in order
to limit the problems associated in the past with long-term technical assistance (LT TA),
the TA framework has been designed focusing on short-term technical assistance (ST
TA), reducing LT TA as far as possible (paras 3.10 to 3.12) with a mix of foreign and
local experts. Foreign LT TA appointments have been limited to assistance to the
development of a national LRCI (para. 2.25), and project financial and contract
management (para. 2.34). In addition, eight local long-term consultants (for periods of 2
to 3 years) to support the RB and LCU regional offices, and project financial
management, accounting, and contract management, and 2 local trainers for 2 years, will
be appointed. A total of 322 sm of ST TA will be provided for this component under the
project (221 staff-months for institutional reform support, and 101 staff-months for
capacity building), including support to the implementation of road safety and axle-load
control action plans mostly financed by other donors (57 staff-months) and to the training
of MOW staff (para. 2.37) and contractors (para. 2.25).
Institutional Reform
2.21  The Institutional Reform sub-component would focus on the development of a
comprehensive restructuring strategy for the sector and the implementation of key policy
reforms. The project base costs are estimated at about US$7.5 million. Support from
IDA under the project amounts to about US$3.2 million, with the addition of about
US$4.0 million for road safety and axle-load control from GOL and tentatively the EU,
and about US$0.5 million of operating costs financed by Government. IDA's support
would mainly consist of 106 sm of various ST TA, 48 sm of foreign LT TA and an
additional two local trainers for a period of 2 years to develop the LRCI, and 58 sm of ST
TA for training of contractors. The sub-component includes:
(a)   reviewing and improving as needed the cost recovery mechanisms for
maintenance expenditures and their management, and securing local
funding sources for upgrading investments:
(i)   strengthening the sustainability of the Road Fund through
appropriate increase of selected road user charges (fuel user fee,



- 26 -
motor vehicle and heavy vehicle licensing fees, border fees, transit
fees, and fines on overloaded vehicles) as required to mobilize
adequate funding for road maintenance purposes, and assessing the
necessity to give the Road Board more autonomy;
(ii)  reviewing the conditions of utilization of the LHWP Development
Fund for road construction investments and the Food for Work
Program, with regard to the recommendations of the Lesotho
Poverty Assessment Study to move from a mix of food aid and
cash incentives to a labor-wage only basis, and the new initiative
launched by Government to finance rural development projects
initiated by the Village Development Councils (VDCs, from the
LHWP Development Fund;
(b)   restructuring the institutional environment of MOW (which will require
the revision of the Road Act) including:
(i)   streamlining and strengthening the organizational structure of
MOW, through regrouping the three road agencies (RB, LCU, and
CWS) under a single management (and subsequently
disbanding/restructuring force accomnt units), strengthening the
planning unit which has been instated in MOW, and
restructuring/privatizing PVPS;
(ii)  strengthening the Local Road Construction Industry (LRCI) in
parallel with MOW reorganization, through a gradual increase in
contracting out activities and training of contractors, and primarily
aimed at small contractors using labor-based methods;
(iii)  implementing a reclassification of the overall road network,
including renumbering the network, defining a mechanism for
gazetting and transferring roads (from CWS to LCU, and LCU to
RB) according to revised criteria, and allocating responsibility for
roads currently under the de facto LHDA administration; and
(iv)  carrying out a study to determine the feasibility and conditions of
the creation of an independent Road Authority;
(c)   defming environmental standards, quality control procedures, and adapted
design standards for road works (including refining the technical and
procedures manuals produced under the IEP training program), and
elaborating guidelines setting a common methodology and reporting
system for engineering studies;



- 27 -
(d)   carrying out urgent actions related with road transport policy issues which
are key to infrastructure (road safety, axle-load enforcement and control
procedures and legislation); and
(e)   conducting systematic beneficiary assessments with road users,
establishing the necessary advisory groups, and involving stakeholders in
road management through participation in the Road Board, and eventually
(subsequently) the Board of the Road Authority.
This sub-component will be implemented through four action plans to: (i) restructure the
institutional environment of the road sector, including inter alia regrouping the three road
agencies within MOW, instating a planning unit in MOW, and a strategy for
restructuring/privatizing PVPS; (ii) developing local contractors and restructuring force
account units; (iii) implementing road safety actions; and (iv) enforcing axle-load control
procedures. In addition studies will be carried out during project implementation,
including inter alia the following three key ones: (i) implementing a roads reclassifying,
gazetting and transferring mechanism, and allocating responsibility for all roads to each
MOW agency; (ii) strengthening the Road Fund, determining the feasibility and
conditions of the creation of an independent Road Authority, and evaluating the financing
conditions and road selection criteria of the LHWP and FWP programs; and (iii) defining
and adopting quality control procedures and adapted design standards for road works,
preparing detailed environmental guidelines and standards for road works, adopting
construction methods aimed at minimizing possible adverse environmental impact, and
elaborating guidelines for engineering studies.
2.22  To ensure the efficient raising and allocation of funds, their timely release, and a
degree of accountability and transparency, GOL has established a Road Fund, based on
cost recovery from road users, under the form of a special account opened in MOF.
Instructions related to its operation, sources of revenue and amounts appropriated for the
first year -Lesotho FY 1996/7- under the consolidated fund, are under preparation. In the
short term GOL will focus on ensuring the system operates effectively, funds being
deposited on a quarterly basis, and withdrawal requiring the signature of the Chief
Financial Controller in MOF and one official designated by MOW. To ensure
accountability, management of the Road Fund has been devolved to an independent Road
Board, where both institutional stakeholders and road users are represented (para. 2.32).
The Road Board has been appointed by the Minister of Finance, with institutional and
operating modalities agreed with IDA, and could in the future include representatives of the
districts. In the medium term, however, a study will be carried out to assess the
appropriateness of the Road Fund management procedures and revenue sources, the need
for improved allocation procedures and revenue collection to strengthen its sustainability,
and implementing recommendations after consultation with IDA (para. 2.27). GOL
provided assurances at negotiations that they will maintain the Road Board with functions
and responsibilities satisfactory to IDA (para. 5.6). Specific support could be provided to
the Road Fund under the project as necessary as part of the assistance to MOW in
financial and contract management (para. 2.34).



- 28 -
2.23  This strategy will be implemented in parallel with reforms aimed at restructuring
MOW and its institutional environment, which Government intends to lead to the creation
of an independent Road Authority. The first immediate step involves: (a) regrouping all
road agencies under MOW, and subsequently streamlining operations and the
organizational structure of MOW (paras 1.18 and 1.19), with 8 sm of ST TA support
under the project; (b) strengthening MOW in planning, programming, contract
management, and supervision tasks, in particular through support to the newly-created
planning unit responsible for implementing a flexible planning framework (with the
PMMS as an operational programming tool) and a monitoring/evaluation system (paras
1.22 and 2.35); and (c) restructuring/commercializing PVPS (para. 1.21), with 26 sm of
ST TA support provided under the project, based on: (i) starting auctioning off PVPS
heavy equipment and selling PVPS light equipment to local contractors, in line with the
Government strategy to contract out road works; (ii) transfer vehicles to each line
ministry with freedom to contract out maintenance; (iii) commercialization of the vehicle
maintenance services with respect to local private sector capacity, and (iv) reorganizing
the procurement and management of the fleet under MOF. Government will take all
measures required to integrate the roads and footbridges section of CWS within MOW,
and submit an action plan for the restructuring of MOW and the restructuring and
privatization of PVPS, acceptable to IDA, and to be subsequently included in the
Implementation Manual, prior to project effectiveness (para. 5.4).
2.24  An expected second step will consist of privatizing, disbanding inefficient or
restructuring redundant force account activities (paras 1.20 and 1.36), which would save
management costs, to be carried out with 8 sm of ST TA support, in the following
priority order: (i) regrouping of RIU and RCU in the RB, and consolidation and eventual
privatization of the new unit; (ii) gradual restructuring of selected force account units in
line with the contractors development program; and (iii) restructuring of RB and LCU
vehicle and plant maintenance workshops, with respect to the contracting out of regular
maintenance activities. This step would be conducted in parallel with the implementation
of the LRCI strategy (paras 4.14 and 4.15), which aims at facilitating contractors
development (paras 1.33 and 1.36). The extent and the pace of reducing force account
operations have not yet been finalized, although the action plan for the restructuring of
MOW indicates the strategy to be followed and commitment from GOL has been
endorsed in the LSP. General targets for reducing the number of force account units and
staff have been agreed during negotiations as part of the project monitoring indicators. A
common action plan to restructure force account units and develop local contractors will
be included in the Implementation Manual after review prior to effectiveness. The
actions regarding the retrenchment of staff in force account units will be refined as part of
the manpower development action plan (paras 2.37 to 2.39) and implemented with
support from the project in parallel with the MOW training program (para. 2.40).
2.25  Support to the development of the LRCI focuses on: (i) implementing a
sustainable maintenance system whereby local contractors using labor-based techniques
will be progressively taking on maintenance activities; (ii) developing staff from local
contractors through a comprehensive set of training courses; and (iii) putting into place a



- 29 -
comprehensive set of measures to support contractors development. The number of
contractors to be trained has been calculated on the basis of fairly fixed amounts of works
that they could undertake each year, but increased productivity is expected to occur,
which will enable competition. IDA's assistance is based upon LT TA (48 sm foreign, 48
sm of 2 local trainers, and 5 engineers in the regional offices -para. 2.33), and 58 sm of
ST TA training for local contractors, including continuing the routine maintenance and
regravelling training courses for labor-based contractors initiated under the IEP (para.
1.34), extending/adapting courses to benefit contractors who will be involved in RB
routine maintenance activities, and carrying out courses for upgrading gravel roads to
engineered standards aimed at local contractors "graduated" from maintenance activities.
The training program will focus, besides technical aspects, on site management, costing,
answering tenders, and book keeping. The extension and equipment of the Teyateyaneng
training center, aimed at accommodating the large increase in training courses for both
RB and LCU staff and contractors, will be supported by the project (para. 2.40). Various
measures (para. 1.35) include: (i) access to equipment (with the pursuit of the LCU
lease/hire system started under the IEP); (ii) simplified standard contracting documents
for each category of works with adapted technical specifications and simplified payment
procedures for securities and performance guarantees; (iii) improved accounting
procedures in LCU and RB to account for different types of operations (routine and
periodic maintenance, rehabilitation, upgrading); and (iv) appropriate contract packaging,
and direct awarding to local contractors small performance-related contracts (mostly
maintenance, but also gradually rehabilitation and upgrading) to be partly IDA-financed,
and training contracts on a fee basis (para. 3.14).
2.26  A third step will consist of revisiting the road classification and current road
management responsibilities, and introducing changes in the Road Act as appropriate.
This will take place before the planning/programming system is finalized and fully
implemented, and decisions be made regarding a more autonomous road management
structure (para. 1. 18). Proposed changes include revising the road classification system,
with the addition of a fourth class (village access roads), setting out new road gazetting
criteria and mechanisms for transferring roads falling under road classifications to the
responsible agency, and registering all non gazetted roads found to belong in the first
three classes (main and rural road networks). A 10 sm study to define a revised
functional reclassification and renumber the network accordingly, and elaborate a
mechanism for gazetting and transferring roads, will be carried out during the first year of
project implementation. TOR's, to be filed in the Implementation Manual, have been
agreed at negotiations.
2.27 The final step would consist of assisting Government in implementing its
intention, stated in its LSP, to transform MOW road agencies into an autonomous Road
Authority. The objective would be to create a single commercially-oriented, autonomous
and accountable National Road Authority (NRA), with management devolved to a Chief
Executive Officer under the monitoring of the Road Board previously created for the Road
Fund. Support from the project will be extended to senior management of MOW and
road agencies to undertake a series of study tours (para. 2.40) of other African countries



- 30 -
to review alternatives and options for strengthening the Road Fund mechanism and
possibly establishing an autonomous Roads Authority. This, and the revision of the
gazetting mechanism, would call for revising the 1969 Road Act. GOL provided
assurances at negotiations that they will carry out, with support from the project (14 sm
of ST TA), starting no later than March 1997, a study determining the feasibility and
conditions for the creation of an independent Road Authority, jointly with the review of
the Road Fund and Road Board functioning (para. 2.22), as well as the evaluation of the
financing conditions and road selection criteria of the LHWP Development Fund and
FWP programs (para. 2.21 (a) (ii)). TORs, to be filed in the Implementation Manual,
have been agreed at negotiations.
2.28  The need for simplifying and harmonizing standards and specifications, and the
format of engineering studies and consultancy contracts is crucial at a time when many
road works will be carried out (para. 1.24). Design standards will be developed on the
basis of those in force in the region and drawing from the SATCC regional trunk road
guidelines, suitably amended to reflect the local conditions with respect to geography,
materials sources, work methods used, etc. In addition, methodology and reporting
guidelines will be elaborated for consultants carrying out engineering studies, in order to
harmonize design and ensure comparability and consistency of feasibility and design
studies. Short-term engineering assistance (14 sm) will be provided under the project to:
(i) review and elaborate revised road and bridges design standards and standard
specifications for Lesotho, including refining the technical and procedures manuals
produced under the IEP training program; (ii) establish quality control procedures; and
(iii) elaborate environmental guidelines for engineering studies, impact assessments, and
construction standards (para. 4.18). TORs, to be filed in the Implementation Manual,
have been agreed at negotiations.
2.29 There are a number of road transport issues requiring Government decision and
action (paras 1. 1 0 and 1. 11). The key issues concern the restructuring of the Road
Transport Board, the reorganization of the Ministry of Transport and Communications
(MOTC) and the modification of permits issuance, and are highlighted in the National
Transport Study (NTS). Government is expected to take a decision regarding the
recommendations of the NTS before Board effectiveness, and prepare an action plan to
implement key policy reform measures in the transport sector (including in particular the
mechanism to set domestic fares) during the project execution period, and review and
redraft as necessary the existing Road Transport Act and Road Traffic Regulations. This
will be supported from the project with 6 sm of ST TA.
2.30  Road transport issues related to infrastructure (road safety and axle-load control)
will be dealt with through two action plans, which will be included in the Implementation
Manual after review prior to effectiveness. The road safety situation in Lesotho is one of
the worst in the world (para. 1.12). An action plan estimated to cost about US$3.5
million, would be implemented in three phases: (i) development of a traffic and accident
recording form, training of MOW staff and Traffic Police, information, education and
drivers' training; for an estimated 12 sm of external assistance and US$35,000 of



- 31 -
equipment; (ii) organization and legislation (Road Safety Board, Road Safety section),
setting up a computerized accident data base, implementing engineering counter
measures, continuing training, public campaigns and implementation of signs, and law
enforcement equipment, for an estimated 28 sm of assistance, US$2.0 million of works
and US$0.7 million of equipment; and (iii) evaluation, additional training, and further
equipment for law enforcement, for an estimated 10 sm of assistance, and US$100,000 of
equipment. Expenditures relative to the first phase will be financed from existing EU
funds, and the US$2.0 million of road works to improve black spots will be financed
from the Road Fund. Other phases would be tentatively financed by the EU.
2.31  Axle load control enforcement procedures are currently weak (para. 1.13). The
corresponding action plan, estimated to cost about US$300,000 in equipment and lay-bys
implementation, includes 7 sm of ST TA. It would implement the following measures in
three phases over the 5-year project execution period: organization of the control between
traffic police and DTT, selection of control points on roads carrying the heaviest traffic
(in particular on the border points of the corridors to the LHDA dam construction sites
and around Maseru), selection and procurement of reliable and accurate portable
weighscales, installation of facilities at the control points, and establishment of random
control programs at each point, and training of staff. However, it must be noticed that it
will be extremely difficult for Lesotho to enforce even a 10 ton load limit when the limit
in the RSA is 13 ton per axle. This assistance would be tentatively financed by the EU.
2.32  Systematic beneficiary assessments will be conducted with road users. Popular
participation in the design and implementation of the low volume rural roads component
of the project will be strengthened. Beneficiary assessments of road users and
community representatives, and surveys of stakeholders will be carried out during the
whole project execution period by local consultants to be recruited under the project
(estimated at about 4 sm per year). Moreover, road transport stakeholders will be
involved in road management through their participation in the Road Board (paras 3.6
and 3.7).
Capacity-Building
2.33 A comprehensive capacity-building sub-component has been developed, including
the following: (i) strengthening MOW implementation capacity, including RB and LCU
regional offices, focusing on accounting and financial management, supervision of the
contracting out process (including strengthening of laboratory and quality control
functions), planning and programming of road works (including traffic counting
organization and data base updating), and organizing efficient maintenance systems for
all roads; (ii) elaborating a manpower development action plan with respect to the
prospective reduction in the large number of expatriates occupying line management
positions, through instating improved human resources management and career
development; and (iii) implementing a training program focusing in particular on middle
level technicians. Support from the project is estimated at about US$5.8 million,
including US$0.8 million of operating costs to be financed by GOL. It would mainly



- 32 -
consist of: (i) 75 staff-months of ST TA for MOW strengthening, and 60 staff-months of
foreign LT TA to be appointed in a central financial and contract management unit
(FCMU) to be placed in MOW (para. 2.34); (ii) five local contract managers for the RB
and LCU regional offices (with a role in developing the LRCI), a local contract manager
for the LCU Headquarters, and a local accountant and a local financial controller to be
appointed as counterparts to the FCMU foreign experts, all for a period of 3 years; and
(iii) training (ST TA for an estimated amount of 26 staff-months, extension of the
Teyateyaneng training center, and US$0.8 million in support to training). In addition,
Irish Aid is financing respectively two and one engineers in advising positions in the RB
and LCU until December 1997.
2.34 Measures to improve the limited capacity of Implementing Agencies to handle the
financial management, accounting, and contract management functions of the project
(paras 1.23 and 1.31), in addition to strengthening non project-specific procedures in this
area, will focus primarily on the central level of MOW, in particular the finance sections
of RB and LCU. This objective is concurrent with the need to manage the sector in a
more integrated manner (para. 1.22) and the strengthening of the planning unit in MOW
(para. 2.23), so that assistance under the project will include both: (i) supporting
accounting, financial management, and contract monitoring capacity; and (ii)
strengthening budgetary, planning and programming procedures for the roads sector. A
Financial and Contract Management Unit (FCMU) will be created and financed under the
project, and will be staffed with foreign Financial and Contract Managers respectively for
3 and 2 years, and a local Financial Controller and a local Accountant for 3 years.
Evidence of the recruitment of these four staff would be submitted to IDA prior to
effectiveness (para. 5.4). Additional ST TA (8 sm) will also be provided under the
project, when the FCMU would have become fully autonomous and Basotho-run, and
could be extended as necessary to the Road Fund pending the recommendations of the
study of the Road Fund functioning (para. 2.27). The assistance will focus on
strengthening and decentralizing the IEP-initiated accounting, record keeping and
financial management procedures, establishing contract monitoring systems and
consolidated monthly project cost reporting systems, and continuing the IEP-started
training of road agencies staff in project reporting (forms of contract and contract
conditions, disbursement forms) and financial management (para. 3.2). A time-bound
program, aimed at improving capacity in these areas will be defined as part of the work
program of the FCMU team when it will be contracted or right after mobilization.
2.35 Support will be extended to strengthen the newly-created planning unit in MOW,
which will be responsible for coordinating road programming. This unit could in time be
turned into the financial and planning unit of the Road Authority if and when created.
Assistance to planning and programming will take the form of ST TA for an amount of
27 sm to: (i) consolidate the PMMS system with the elaboration of additional modules
(unit cost, traffic counting) and ad-hoc assistance to conduct traffic counts and condition
surveys and operate the system; and (ii) assist the planning unit in budgeting for all
capital projects, and developing maintenance programming procedures to be implemented
by regional engineers after on-the-job assistance and training.



- 33 -
2.36 Proper management of the project requires some strengthening of the
Implementing Agencies in day to day operational management, procurement,
reporting/filing, contract monitoring and supervision (paras 1.33 and 1.34). Support to
MOW implementation capacity will therefore also consist of: (i) additional TA in both
RB and LCU (five local contract and supervision engineers in the regional offices for a
period of two years, with a specific role in developing the local road construction
industry, and a senior contract engineer to assist LCU in managing the heavy load due the
significant increase in road works to be carried out in rural areas); and (ii) 12 sm of ST
TA to implement comprehensive maintenance systems in the districts, and assist in CWS
reorganization after its integration within MOW.
2.37  Key actions to be undertaken in the short-term to enable road agencies to retain
staff (para. 1.30) are: (i) to implement a professional development program for those RB
engineers who received scholarships under the IEP, and review procedures to enforce
bonding agreements and repayment of training fees by staff having benefited from long-
term training overseas; (ii) to elaborate a plan to reassign engineers to vacant positions, or
to specific projects, and rotating them through positions of increasing responsibility
within MOW upon their return from training; (iii) to implement an internal functional
reorganization to give staff more rewarding operational tasks, in parallel with the MOW
restructuring effort and the reduction of force account units(paras 2.23 and 2.24); and (iv)
developing a manpower development action plan for MOW aimed at defining a human
resources strategy, including the necessary retrenchment of force account operational
staff and the recruitment of specialized qualified staff to fill vacant positions and replace
dwindling TA occupying line management positions. This will be supported under the
project with 28 sm of ST TA, and be supplemented by a training program for the
generally insufficiently qualified staff (para. 2.40). Submission by GOL of a long-term
plan to assign staff members trained in the course of their assignment with MOW to
positions commensurate with the responsibilities they were trained for, including
evidence of the reassignment of stafftrained under the IEP upon their return, is a
condition of effectiveness (para. 5.4). Assurance has been provided by GOL at
negotiations that they will elaborate prior to the mid-term review, and implement during
the project execution period, a manpower development action plan (para. 5.6).
2.38  Staff, who will be primarily affected by the disbanding of force account units are
mostly non permanent laborers currently scattered in the field (except for PVPS). This
will minimize the impacts of staff retrenchment, as it is expected that those workers
would constitute a reservoir of labor for the local contractors who will carry out the bulk
of the maintenance works. While the long-term policy is being defined to retain staff
within MOW as part of the manpower development action plan, other short-term
measures, such as short-term training of permanent staff and the provision of supervision
vehicles, will be implemented. In particular, permanent staff of the force account units
are mainly technical officers, technical assistants and laboratory assistants, who will
undergo extensive training to acquire the required skills to carry out the main tasks of
supervising works and monitoring the network condition.



- 34 -
2.39 The manpower development strategy aimed at addressing the capacity issue (para.
1.29) will be based upon assessing the necessary evolution of staff skills vis a vis current
staffing profiles, training needs, and new organizational requirements to take place in
MOW in line with GOL's policy to increase contracting out. Support (12 sm of ST TA)
will be provided for the evaluation of training needs and skill gaps (including a list of
potential trainees, evaluation of their skills deficiencies vis a vis their tasks, analysis of
the job descriptions and staff workload, linkage between such analyses and content of
courses, training modalities, timetable for training programs) vis a vis MOW development
objectives.
2.40  A staff training program will be included in the project, based on short-term
Lesotho-based training in design, environmental assessment, quality control, works
supervision, accounting and financial management methods, and investment decision-
making techniques. A draft training program will be prepared with support form the IEP,
and be submitted to IDA prior to effectiveness (para. 5.4). Further analysis of training
needs, in particular for the senior LCU staff who did not benefit from any IDA-funded
training under the IEP, will be conducted at the onset of the project. A permanent Training
Division (responsible for all road training activities) could be created in MOW under the
project. The project support will take the form of: (i) 14 staff-months ST TA to prepare
and coordinate training short-term programs; (ii) training courses, study tours and
regional fellowships (US$ 350,000); and (iii) extending the training capacity at
Teyateyaneng (design and supervision, civil works estimated at US$350,000, and
US$150,000 of training equipment). The Teyateyaneng training center will be mainly
used for contractor training, but also for requalification courses for MOW staff.
Logistical Support
2.41  An estimated additional US$0.9 million would be provided for logistical support
to RB and LCU, including (i) office equipment, mainly related to the financial and
contract monitoring aspects, as MOW will require appropriate computer hardware and
software, such as computerized accounting packages or Dbase programs (para. 3.4); (ii)
vehicles for works supervision; and (iii) laboratory and quality control equipment.
D. PROJECT COST
2.42  The five-year project (including physical and price contingencies) is estimated to
cost US$129 million, of which about 56% would be in foreign exchange. Of the base
costs of about US$112 million, about US$18.5 million would be for institutional support
and engineering services (including US$0.9 million in logistical support), which are all
IDA-financed except about US$4 million for road safety and axle-load measures
(including US$2 million in road safety works and US$1.1 million in equipment), and
US$93.5 million allocated to civil works (including about US$49 million for the 5-year
maintenance program mostly financed by GOL). Road works costs have been calculated
including unidentified taxes and duties. Price contingencies of about US$7.5 million, or
about 7% of base costs, have been included at rates of 2.6 % for the period based on



- 35 -
expected US$ inflation rates. Physical contingencies of about US$10 million (about 9%
of base costs) have also been included. A summary cost table is included below, and
detailed cost estimates are shown in the two tables of Annex D.

2.43    Cost estimates are based: (i) for road works, on PMMS unit costs revised as per
the latest local and regional contracts and a collection of Lesotho data; and (ii) for
equipment, TA and training on recent quotations. Base costs are based on current prices
as of July 1995. The average rehabilitation costs have been respectively estimated for
paved and gravel roads. The average upgrading costs per km have been estimated
respectively for LCU gravel standards, and RB gravel standards and paved standards. Unit
costs for maintenance of LCU roads -provided by LCU- appear high, a result of the
relatively high cost of labor which accounts for a large share of the cost under the labor-
based works, and will be annually reviewed. Routine and periodic maintenance costs on
CWS roads have been estimated from figures of the FWP program and CWS rates. Costs
are expected to decrease due to increased competition between contractors, which would
mean additional capacity to fund upgrading works for which a financing gap may exist.



- 36 -
E. PROJECT FINANCING
2.44 GOL will contribute about US$64.5 million equivalent (about 50 % of the total
project costs ) for local project expenditures, including maintenance and operating costs.
Total external financing is estimated to be about US$64.5 million. With IDA providing
US$40.0 million, which would finance about 31 % of the total project costs, parallel co-
financing of US$24.5 million will be needed for the remaining 19 % of total project costs.
In the event that other donors cannot commit to the full requirement, GOL would finance
the additional cost, or the upgrading program would be scaled back after the mid-term
review. The detailed financing plan is in Annex E. A summary of the financing plan for
IDA and other potential donors likely to participate in the project is summarized below:
Summary Financing Plan
(USS million)  Local     Foreign  Total    %
IDA           13.2       26.8     400      31%

Total        |56.8      72.2      129.0   100%/0
2.45 All maintenance works and about 85% of rehabilitation and upgrading works are
fully funded. To match capital investments with GOL's capacity to fund their subsequent
maintenance, the upgrading works program, mostly planned for implementation during
the outer years of the program, will be revisited at the mid-term review, and its
implementation paced with progress in policy reforms, implementation capacity, and
maintenance funding (paras 3.6 and 3.24). Full sustainability of Government funding for
road maintenance will be achieved from user charges at the end of the project period.
Foreign Funding
2.46 The proposed IDA credit of US$40.0 million would finance various parts of the
project. IDA will support Government effort during the project life by: (i) financing
periodic maintenance of LCU and CWS roads (para. 2.11) on a decreasing basis from
50% in 1996/1997 to 20% in 1998/1999; (ii) funding a large share of rehabilitation
projects at 70 % of contract costs; and (iii) funding in priority order the upgrading of
CWS roads and selected RB and LCU roads, at 90% of contract costs, at a pace matching
the financial and institutional capacity to operate and maintain such investments. IDA
will finance selected LCU and CWS periodic maintenance contracts, with GOL fully
financing the remainder, such that GOL finances respectively 50% and 80% of the total
periodic maintenance of LCU and CWS roads in 1996/7 and 1998/9.



- 37 -
2.47 About US$24.5 million will be required in parallel financing from the donor
community. Irish Aid is already committed to finance US$1.7 million equivalent.
Pending the conclusions of the upcoming negotiations between the EU and GOL
regarding the eighth European Development Fund (EDF) allocation for Lesotho, the EU
has indicated that US$17.0 million could be secured for civil works, and that about
US$2.0 million of additional funds could be mobilized to help finance the US$4.0 million
road safety and axle-load components. Existing EU funds could finance the first phase of
the road safety and axle-load components. A firm commitment can only be made when
these negotiations are finalized, which is expected to be by October 1996. KfW will be
reviewing its program in 1996, and would reallocate about US$0.8 million of residual
finds to rehabilitating or upgrading LCU roads, and could further allocate from US$1.5
to 4.0 million to civil works, which would cover the existing US$4.0 million to be funded
by other donors. This would leave no financing gap or a small financing gap, which, if
no other donors can be brought in, would have to be financed by GOL or eliminated
through a reduction in the upgrading program.
Local Funding
2.48 Annual domestic funding requirements, for both the maintenance of the network
and the local counterpart funding of the rehabilitation and upgrading program have been
quantified. GOL is committed to increase allocations for road maintenance over the five-
year project period so as to domestically fund all maintenance requirements by 2000.
GOL will finance 100% of road routine maintenance and periodic maintenance of RB roads
over the life of the project, and an increasing share (50% to 100%) of LCU and CWS roads
periodic maintenance (para. 2.46). This will amount to about US$49.0 million, over the
five years, including about US$9.0 million in each of the first two years. Road maintenance
funding requirements will stabilize at about US$11.5 million per annum by 2001 after
project completion. GOL will also finance bridge maintenance and road safety
improvements from the Road Fund, provide an average of about US$1.5 million per annum
as local contribution towards the capital costs of the project (including counterpart funds for
rehabilitation from the Road Fund), and finance operating costs for various activities under
the training and manpower development, local road construction industry development, and
institutional reform components.
2.49  Revenues requirements (in million Maloti at constant prices) for road maintenance
and rehabilitation are shown below:

* Amount lower than total due to IDA financing, on a decreasing basis, periodic maintenance of LCU and
CWS roads
2.50 From the beginning of 1996, the Road Fund will be financed through a fuel
charge of Lisente 39 per diesel liter (about 11 US cents) and 31 per petrol liter (about 9
US cents). For 1996 it is estimated that Maloti 38 million (about US$10.5 million at the
year end exchange rate) would be sufficient to finance planned maintenance and
rehabilitation expenditures, including bridge maintenance and road safety counter
measures (counterpart funds for upgrading works would come from the general budget).
2.51   Various assurances have been sought from GOL in connection with this financing.
Evidence, acceptable to IDA, that GOL has allocated adequate funds to road maintenance
and rehabilitation in the FY 1996 Finance Budget, is a condition of effectiveness for this
credit (para. 5.4). GOL has provided assurances at negotiations (para. 5.6) to: (i) allocate
and disburse adequate and timely annual funding for the project through the Road Fund,
and use its proceeds only for maintenance and rehabilitation; and (ii) undertake no later
than March 1998 a study of the operations of the Road Fund, on terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA, and implement its recommendations as agreed with IDA (para. 2.22).
Changes to the structure of the Road Fund, which could adversely impact the efficient
and accountable financing of road maintenance, would only be done after prior
consultation with IDA.

3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
3.1  In order to maximize capacity building, the project would be implemented by the
MOW, with RB, LCU and CWS having management responsibility for the road
programs. No new agencies would be created at project inception, but MOW would be
restructured under the project, and Government has committed in its LSP to transform
road agencies into an autonomous Road Authority (para. 2.27). However, institutional
development under the Project is complex, and will require a Project Coordinator to
coordinate the various actions. The Project Coordinator will be nominated by the
Minister of Works, in consultation with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of
Economic Planning (MEP), from among senior staff in MOW by no later than project
effectiveness, and report to the Minister of Works. The policy reform and institutional
development process involves other key stakeholders, such as the MEP, MOF, MOTC
and Traffic Police. A Project Coordinating Committee, headed by the MOW Project
Coordinator, and including the Senior Economic Planner in charge of Infrastructure in
MEP, the Chief Financial Controller in MOF, the RB and LCU Chief Engineers, the
CWS Senior Engineer, the Director of the MOW Planning Unit, the Financial Manager of
the FCMU (para. 2.34), and the DTT Commissioner of MOTC, will be created and have
overall responsibility for monitoring the road sector policy reform process. Other
personnel could be appointed as deemed necessary by GOL. The Project Coordinator
(who was to be nominated before project effectiveness -para. 5.4) and the Project
Coordinating Committee have already been appointed. MEP would have particular
responsibility for ensuring proper implementation of sector policies within the framework
set out for the infrastructure sector in the SEOR (paras 1.41 and 1.43).
3.2  In order to be able to meet the accounting, financial and contract management
requirements of the project, MOW will strengthen its capacity, with the support of a
Financial and Contract Management Unit (FCMU), attached to MOW (para. 2.34). The
unit will carry out the tasks of accounting, record keeping and financial management,
contract monitoring and establishing consolidated monthly cost reports, and carrying out
the requisite training for concerned personnel in MOW (para. 2.35). Due to the limited
capacity in the implementing agencies to handle financial matters, the FCMU will in
addition be responsible for managing the project accounts and disbursements (para. 3.23).
The unit will also interface with the Road Fund by assisting in the design and
implementation of appropriate procedures for the financial and budgetary management of
roads. Support from the Project will be based on the recruitment of a Financial Manager



- 40 -
and a Contract Manager (long-term technical assistance of respectively 3 and 2 man-
years). In addition fully professionally qualified local counterparts (Accountant and
Financial Controller) would be recruited on a contract basis by MOW. The IDA credit
would finance an initial period of 3 years, before direct employment can be secured by
MOW through the Road Fund or the NRA. GOL has provided assurances at negotiations
that they will maintain the FCMU throughout the project execution period (para. 5.6).
The recruitment of the four FCMU staff (Financial Manager, Contract Manager,
Financial Controller, Accountant would take place prior to effectiveness (para. 5.4), and
the beginning of services is expected to be as of July 1996.
3.3   A Project Launch Workshop will be carried out. Project Implementation
supervision will be carried out through annual reviews, based on agreed criteria and
procedures to evaluate progress and revise road programs and action plans as necessary.
In addition, a comprehensive mid-term review would be undertaken by the end of the
second year of project implementation, to assess implementation progress, in particular
vis a vis achieved institutional and financial reforms, and determine the scope and pace at
which upgrading investments would be made in the outer years of the project. GOL has
provided assurances at negotiations that they will conduct a comprehensive mid-term
review by no later than March 1998, and annual project reviews with IDA and other
participating donors around March of each year, starting one year after effectiveness, and
will carry out the recommendations of these reviews as agreed with IDA (para. 5.6).
3.4   Key monitorable indicators of successful physical and financial implementation
have been developed to measure implementation success, and progress at the institutional
level will be monitored through completed studies, action plans' achievements, and
regular progress reports (para. 4.9). Project performance indicators (para. 4. 10) have
been agreed at negotiations. CPM will be used for IDA monitoring of the project. A
detailed Project Implementation Manual, an index of which is included as Annex F, has
been prepared by GOL, and will be updated for each annual review. It includes all
documents used in the project preparation, except for the processing documentation
(IEPS, FEPS, authorization memoranda, and comments, which are included in Bank
files). Its primary audience is the implementing staff themselves. Receipt of evidence
that GOL has adopted a Project Implementation Manual acceptable to IDA will be a
condition of effectiveness (para. 5.4). Summaries of the institutional and physical
implementation plans are in Annexes G and H respectively, and have been agreed at
negotiations. GOL has provided assurances at negotiations that they will implement the
project in accordance with the implementation program (para. 5.6).
3.5   The annual reviews will evaluate the status and performance of the project over
the previous year, on the basis of the measure of the performance indicators, after
adequate and proper data collection has been conducted. The following aspects will be
reviewed in particular: (i) Institutional Reform policy actions, and progress in instituting
a coherent legal and regulatory framework, in particular with respect to the road funding
recovery and allocation mechanisms; (ii) effectiveness of the Capacity Building sub-
component; (iii) measures to ensure efficient utilization of TA, including appropriate



- 41 -
transfer of technology to local counterparts; (iv) detailed upgrading, rehabilitation and
maintenance targets (km achieved in various categories), and procurement arrangements;
(v) funding level (financial costs and disbursement targets); and (vi) annual surveys of
road users and other stakeholders, in particular communities benefiting from the
upgrading of rural tracks (para. 2.32). Four weeks prior to each review, GOL will submit
to IDA in preparation for the review a report covering performance over the past year and
a draft action plan to address pending issues. Road programs will be defined in
accordance with the undertakings set out in the LSP, and mutually agreed between GOL
and IDA at each annual project review. GOL has provided assurances at negotiations that
the detailed road programs for each year will be defined: (i) on the basis of the road
selection criteria (para. 4.3) agreed with IDA at negotiations and included in the LSP; (ii)
with regard to progress as measured through the project performance indicators; and (iii)
provided that financing has been secured, and design -including satisfactory
environmental analysis- has been completed (para. 5.6).
3.6   The mid-term review, to be conducted no later than March 1998, will assess
progress with the proposed institutional, capacity building, financial, and physical
requirements, set out Government financial and managerial capacity to implement the
upgrading program in the following three years of the project, and eventually restructure
the project as appropriate (para. 2.45). It will cover the same issues as in the annual
reviews, and include a detailed assessment of the substantial completion of specific
institutional, policy and implementation actions listed in Annex I. It will in particular
focus on the following aspects: satisfactory completion of the first two years maintenance
program (funding and kilometers having undergone actual maintenance work as per
targets agreed at negotiations), progress of the Institutional Reform action plans,
implementation of human resource initiatives and TA performance, and elaboration of
detailed environmental guidelines satisfactory to IDA. Thereafter, annual reviews of
progress will determine the details of the following year program.
3.7   Taking measures to develop capacity in MOW and restructure road management
will not suffice to achieve sustainability, without strengthened ownership and enhanced
participation of road users and Village Development Councils (VDCs) representing local
populations in the decision-making process (para. 2.32). Populations will play a
significant role in the design, priority setting and implementation of the low volume rural
roads component of the project through: (i) accounting for VDCs' priorities and
population density in the selection of rural feeder roads to be upgraded to all-weather
standards, as agreed with Government (para. 4.3); (ii) direct selection by local
communities of roads and footbridges to be funded under the LHWP Development Fund
program, (iii) involvement in maintenance and rehabilitation of village roads, through
labor-based works paid for in cash, and to be increasingly financed from the Road Fund
on a cost-sharing basis; and (iv) food aid from the FWP program managed by the CWS
section. The use of labor-based methods in most works on rural roads is adapted to rural
areas lacking technical skills, and maintenance will greatly benefit from the involvement
of populations on their roads. Monitoring of success at the user level in the communities



- 42 -
is complex, but will be assessed vis a vis baseline data (traffic, deterioration, transport
access) and regular beneficiary assessments.
3.8   Road users will be involved in road management through participating in the
Road Board (para. 2.32), which is currently being established, and eventually in the
subsequent Board of the Road Authority. The Road Board consists of eleven members
and a chairman who have been appointed by the Minister of Finance, with six members
being representatives from Government and five representatives from non-government
organizations (including the Lesotho Bus and Mini-bus Operators Association, and the
Lesotho Transport Association). Advisory groups, on such matters as road safety,
environment, engineering, and funding, and headed by Board members to facilitate the
work and functions of the groups, would comprise designated members (or nominated by
different constituencies having a special interest in the matter). To evaluate the extent to
which the needs of the contracting, consulting, and transport industries are being met by
the project, roadside surveys, surveys of taxi and truckers associations, and surveys of its
sector affiliates by the Lesotho Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) will be
undertaken annually. These surveys will form part of the annual review to keep the
project well focused, and representatives of the Board will participate in the reviews.
3.9   The IDA Credit is expected to become effective by April, 1996. The project
should be physically completed by June 30, 2001, and the project's closing date would be
December 31, 2001.
B. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
3.10  Fragmented and poorly coordinated long-term technical assistance, and excessive
use of long-term foreign expatriates in line management positions to substitute for
qualified staff (particularly at the management level) that Government proved unable to
retain, result, now that foreign assistance is dwindling, in limited local capacity in MOW
(para. 1.28). There is a clear consensus among donors not to maintain the current levels
of LT TA, and to implement new solutions to secure implementation capacity (para.
1.30). LT TA has, while major restructuring reforms are gradually carried out, been
limited to the minimum necessary to meet the short-term requirements of
implementation, avoid delays, and enhance the current implementation capacity (para.
2.19).
3.11  The structure and role of LT TA in implementation has been designed to
maximize capacity building and ensure that it builds rather than destroys capacity, by
using it solely for institutional development and capacity building purposes, phasing out
foreign assistance (amounting to about US$1.7 million for 108 staff-months) as soon as
possible, and using local expertise whenever possible (support to regional offices,
trainers, counterparts to Financial Manager and Contract Manager, for a total amount of
about US$1.2 million and 300 staff-months). Its effectiveness will be closely supervised,
through clear terms of reference, detailed task work-plans for the teams and each expert
and counterpart, periodic monitoring of skill transfer performance and quarterly



- 43 -
reporting, counterpart training, and on the job training for returning graduated engineers
trained under the IEP. Terms of reference for key studies and consultancies have been
agreed at negotiations. Monitoring the performance of consultants' services financed
under the Project will be carried out in accordance with evaluation criteria to be agreed
with GOL prior to effectiveness.
3.12    The assistance strategy focuses on utilizing short-term  technical assistance to
compensate for the diminishing number of long-term expatriates, gradually introducing
greater use of local consultants (for example in LCU for small contractors training
purposes), and training personnel on the basis of short-term courses open to the largest
number of technicians and engineers at the middle management level. Project
Preparation and Implementation Support (engineering services) amounts to US$2.0
million (all ST TA), and Policy Support ST TA amounts to US$2.5 million. ST TA for
Institutional Development amounts to about US$4.0 million, including training courses.
A capacity building program with long-term objectives, focusing on human resources
management, and designing and implementing management systems required for capacity
development, will be supported under the project (para. 2.33). ST TA will be reviewed
on an annual basis.

3.14    All IDA-financed civil works contracts will be carried out by contractors.
Procurement for all civil works contracts (total contract values of US$19.3 million) with
an estimated value of above US$0.5 million would be carried out under ICB procedures
(aggregate IDA contribution of up to US$15.3 million). As no contract is estimated to
cost over US$10.0 million equivalent, no prequalification is expected to be required. For
civil works of up to US$0.5 million (total contract values of US$13.6 million, and
aggregate IDA contribution of up to US$9.1 million), NCB procedures would be
employed, and bidding would be open to all appropriately registered and interested local
firms and foreign firms. The extension works at the Teyateyaneng center will be bid
under NCB procedures. Local procurement rules applicable to NCB were reviewed, and
found acceptable and consistent with IDA guidelines so that no waiver will be required.
Selected small contracts may be directly contracted for periodic maintenance on LCU and
CWS gravel roads (total contract values of US$2.3 million, and IDA aggregate
contribution of up to US$1 million), and rehabilitation works on LCU roads (total
contract values of US$ 1.1 million, and IDA aggregate contribution of up to US$0.5
million), which are to be carried out by local labor-based contractors trained under the
IEP or under this project, provided that: (i) IDA's prior no objection has been obtained;
(ii) prices are established by an independent consultant or through negotiations; and (iii)
within the limit of up to a maximum of US$ 100,000 per contract -equivalent to the
average cost of such contracts- corresponding to an aggregate IDA contribution of up to
US$1.5 million. Small local contractors will be eligible for only one direct contract upon
graduation from training, provided that they have not been previously awarded an ICB or
NCB contract. The standard timing of the procurement process and the various packages
are included in the Implementation Manual. A summarized packaging plan is included in
Annex J.
3.15  Consultants for technical and management services and studies would be
appointed in accordance with IDA's guidelines. Design for most rehabilitation and
upgrading components of the program will be prepared by consultants (design for
rehabilitation of RB unpaved roads and upgrading of CWS roads by LCU will be carried
out in-house), and reviewed by IDA. It is expected that consultancies for engineering
surveys and design could be extended on a sole source basis for the supervision of the
works to be subsequently carried out, provided that performance was satisfactory and
clearance obtained from the IDA Regional Procurement Office. This provision, as well
as the agreement that Lesotho taxation laws will apply to all consultants employed in the
Project, will be included in all Letters of Invitation (LOI). Annex K summarizes the
various consultants packages and selection method.
3.16 Contracts for goods with an estimated value above US$100,000 and all laboratory
equipment (control and field surveys equipment) will be procured using ICB procedures
(total contract values of US$0.5 million and aggregate IDA contribution of up to US$0.5
million). Contracts will be grouped as far as possible to match these thresholds.
However, International shopping, or alternatively, IAPSO procedures, could be used for
vehicles and office equipment up to a maximum of US$50,000 equivalent per contract



- 45 -
(total contract values of US$0.4 million, and aggregate IDA contribution of US$0.3
million). Local shopping could be used for furniture and materials required to refurbish
the Teyateyaneng training center up to US$30,000 equivalent per contract (total contract
values of US$0.2 million corresponding to an aggregate IDA contribution of US$0.1
million equivalent).
3.17 All contracts with consulting firms above US$100,000 and individuals above US$
50,000, and goods packages above US$100,000 equivalent, and all upgrading and
rehabilitation civil works packages above US$500,000, will be subject to prior review by
IDA. Neither LCU and CWS periodic maintenance contracts, nor RB and LCU gravel
roads rehabilitation contracts under US$100,000 equivalent, nor individual consultants'
contracts below US$50,000, will undergo prior review but will be subjected to random
post review (one in eight). Contracts to be reviewed represent about 90 % of IDA
financing. All first contracts of each category will be reviewed by IDA. The first
contracts are scheduled to be tendered in July 1996, and supervision consultants will be
appointed when negotiating the contracts with lowest bidders. Packages financed by
parallel co-financiers will be prepared according to the practices or guidelines of the
respective donors.
3.18  The 1995-revised Bank documents will be used as standard bidding and contract
documents for all ICB civil works and goods contracts, and consulting services. The RB
presently uses the standard FIDIC contract documents for their major construction,
rehabilitation and periodic maintenance contracts. However, the FIDIC conditions of
contract are far too tough and restrictive for use by the new small-scale contractors, with
respect to the requirements for bank guarantees, performance bonds, liability insurance,
etc. The LCU has prepared simpler contract conditions for labor-based local contractors,
which have been reviewed and revised for use as standard documents for small-scale
contractors under the project, and included in the Implementation Manual. Standard
bidding and contract documents for the project have been agreed at negotiations. Short-
term technical assistance is included in the project to further develop as needed, on the
basis of the standard documents for local contractors currently used by LCU, a simpler
set of contract documents and conditions to be used under NCB and direct contracting
procedures by both the RB and the LCU (paras. 2.25 and 2.26).
3.19  A standard LOI format for consultancies will be agreed prior to effectiveness,
stipulating the bid conditions for consultants with regard to reimbursable and allowances
(office, office furniture, and operating costs will be financed by GOL). Improved
standard specifications and design and environmental standards will be developed under
the project (para. 2.28). Updates to existing feasibility studies will be commissioned for
the upgrading of road sections included in the outer years of the program.
3.20  Procurement matters and consultant related activities will be the responsibility of
RB and LCU. The review of procurement management procedures shows that there is a
need to strengthen capacity and organization to efficiently manage the procurement
process of the project. A procurement and contract management system, including



- 46 -
checklists for bidding documents' preparation and standard evaluation report formats,
will be developed and gradually instituted in MOW by the Contract Manager in the
FCMU. Furthermore 5 local contract managers will be appointed in the regional offices
of RB and LCU to handle procurement matters and contract monitoring. The training
program will include sessions for RB and LCU staff responsible for procurement and
engineering, and the restructuring of MOW agencies will be conducted with a view to
ensuring that enough manpower is devoted to procurement.
D. DISBURSEMENTS
3.21    The estimated disbursement forecast is summarized below, and the semester
disbursement schedule is shown in Annex L:
Fiscal Years ending June 30 (US$ million)

The proceeds of the proposed credit would be disbursed in accordance with the allocation
by category shown below, over a period of 6 years although implementation is expected
to be completed in 5 years:

3.22 All applications to withdraw proceeds from the credit will be fully documented,
except for (i) expenditures of contracts with an estimated value of US$ 100,000 or less
for civil works; (ii) US$100,000 or less for goods, consulting firms, and training; and (iii)
US$50,000 for individual consultants which reimbursement may be made against
certified statements of expenditures (SOE). Documentation supporting expenditures



- 47 -
claimed against SOEs, would be retained by FCMU, and would be made available for
review by IDA supervision missions and annual audits as necessary.
3.23  To facilitate disbursements, the Government would open a Special Account (SA)
in a Banking Institution located in Maseru, acceptable to IDA, for IDA's share of eligible
expenditures. The SA would be managed by the FCMU. IDA would provide an initial
deposit of US$2 million to IDA's account to cover four months of expenditures. Upon
effectiveness, an amount of US$1 million will be deposited to the Special Account. The
remaining balance will be made available when the aggregate amount withdrawn form
the credit account amounts to US$4 million. The FCMU would be responsible for
submitting regular replenishment applications with appropriate supporting documents for
expenditures. Such applications must be submitted monthly but no later than every three
months. A local bank account may be opened for payments in local currency, using
funds withdrawn from the Special Account, provided that the funds transferred are
utilized within 30 days.
3.24 IDA will co-finance periodic maintenance on LCU and CWS roads, but will only
finance selected contracts, with GOL fully financing the remainder, such that GOL
finances respectively 50% and 80% of the periodic maintenance expenditures in years
1996/1997 and 1998/1999 (paras 2.46 and 2.48). Disbursement of IDA funds for paving
main gravel roads and upgrading selected rural roads (for respective amounts of US$4.5
and 2.3 million) will take place after March 1998.
E. AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING
3.25 The FCMU will be responsible for coordinating project accounting, maintaining
overall records, producing an aggregated and consolidated project account for the project,
managing disbursements, and ensuring timely audit of accounts (para. 2.34). Annual
audits of the IEP project accounts, including the SA and SOEs, are satisfactorily carried
out by the Auditor General's Office, and it is proposed to keep this arrangement. In
addition to the audit report, a management letter (including recommendations regarding
possible improvements in financial management practices and controls) will be submitted
to IDA, within six months of the end of the Lesotho fiscal year (March 30). GOL has
provided assurances at negotiations that Project accounting will be made in accordance
with sound accounting standards, and that timely preparation and submission of annual
financial reports will be ensured (para. 5.6).
F. MONITORING AND REPORTING
3.26 The MOW Project Coordinator, on the basis of reports from RB, LCU and CWS,
will prepare monthly reports, graphically displaying physical and financial progress
against agreed targets, summarizing procurement status, and highlighting problems, with
recommendations for solving them. These reports will be distributed at the end of each
month and will be the subject of Project Coordinating Committee meetings to be held
monthly. Minutes of these meetings will be attached to the following monthly report,



- 48 -
with comments indicating actions taken since the last meeting. Quarterly reports will
summarize the status of each component and the degree of compliance with covenants
and agreements. Within six months of the closing of the credit, MOW will prepare a
report on the implementation of the project. GOL has provided assurances at negotiations
that it will adopt Project reporting and monitoring procedures acceptable to IDA (para.
5.6).
G. SUPERVISION
3.27 Overall, supervision will amount to a total of 15 weeks of field supervision per
annum, requiring an annual travel/subsistence budget of about US$30,000. In addition,
review of documents, reports, etc., in Washington will take an additional 15 weeks per
annum. A plan for the supervision of this project, including a summary of IDA
requirements, is included in Annex M.

4. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. PROJECT BENEFITS
4.1   Substantial quantifiable and non-quantifiable economic benefits are expected from
the project, and in particular: (i) alleviation of poverty; (ii) lower transport and vehicle
operating costs; and (iii) reduction in road works costs from the increased competition
associated with the development of a LRCI. The project is expected to impact positively
a significantly large proportion of poor people, through the large amount of jobs created
from labor-based works and increased access to basic services from upgrading and
rehabilitating rural roads in isolated mountainous areas to all weather standards (para.
4.12). Increased freight and exchange of goods, in particular cattle raised in mountainous
areas, could also result from improved access to district towns due to the upgrading and
rehabilitation of key priority roads. Transport in general will benefit from the lower
vehicle operating costs which will result from improved road conditions. In addition,
much of the rehabilitation works of roads on the brink of severe deterioration will serve
to preserve past investments from accelerated road deterioration, and substantial savings
in future investment and vehicle operating costs are expected from the strengthening of
road maintenance. The development of local contractors, besides its poverty reduction
focus through the support to employment-generating labor-based contractors, aims at
reducing costs with the increase in competition amongst contractors, and at enhancing
efficiency of maintenance operations. The project will also strengthen the
implementation capacity in the road sector through capacity building focusing on
streamlining management and planning procedures. Systematic beneficiary assessments
with road users and local officials, and local involvement in setting priority road upgrading
works, will be used to maximize benefits.
4.2   The economic analysis for civil works on main roads is based upon the IEP-
developed PMMS data base, after updating traffic estimates and unit costs, reducing the
average traffic growth figure from the NTS projections of 6 to 7% for the next five years
to a more realistic 4%, and entering road condition estimates for the LCU network.
Revised road condition estimates for the gravel and earth roads network were also used.
It assessed economic and financial costs, taxes and duties, and foreign and local
percentages, and results are based on HDM (Highway Development Model) runs, which
generally produced consistent results with the PMMS. The analysis has focused on
ensuring that investments made are high priority, and rehabilitation and upgrading of
major roads are all economically viable. No road reconstruction was found to have an



- 50 -
internal economic rate of return (IRR) higher than 12%. The PMMS and HDM analysis
also determined appropriate maintenance options for the RB roads.
4.3   Concerning the upgrading of rural roads to all-weather standards by LCU, it was
agreed with GOL that the analysis of LCU and CWS roads would not be based solely on
a ranking of estimated ERRs to select the highest priority roads. This would not meet the
key GOL objectives of poverty alleviation and opening access to mountainous areas.
Instead, roads have been selected on the basis of both economic analysis (first year ERR
and NPV/C values) weighted with prioritization criteria (population served, District
Council priority ranking, and traffic thresholds). Those criteria have been agreed at
negotiations (paras 3.5). Rehabilitation and maintenance of village roads will be selected
on the basis of communities involvement and choice. IDA's role will be to ensure that
criteria used are consistent, and that a network rationale is carried out in selecting roads.
4.4   Details of the economic analysis are included in the Implementation Manual, and
are summarized in Annex N. The analysis will be updated annually as the program
develops, in particular for the upgrading part of the program, and vehicle operating costs
will be monitored during the project by establishing baseline data at the beginning of the
project.
4.5   Upgrading Works (about 28 % of civil works base costs): the average IRR is
about 121% for RB sections to be upgraded from gravel to paved standards, and the
NPV/Coat ratio for upgrading LCU roads to engineered gravel standards is 0.7 overall.
Guidelines will be agreed to ensure that comparisons between feasibility studies are
possible. About 250 km out of a total of 416 km of CWS rural roads to be upgraded to
engineered gravel standards currently have positive NPV/C values.
4.6   Rehabilitation Works (about 12 % of civil works base costs): the average IRR is
about 49% for RB paved roads, confirming that rehabilitation is economically viable.
Rehabilitation of RB gravel roads in poor condition shows an average IRR of 65%.
Concerning LCU roads, Unit NPV ratios (NPV/km) average 0.025.
4.7   Periodic Maintenance Works (about 22 % of civil works base costs): IRRs
average about 35 % for paved roads (ranging from 12 to 55 %), and 80% for gravel roads
(ranging from 61 to 114%).
4.8   The sensitivity analysis, which was conducted with regard to traffic and discount
rates, shows that roads included in the program qualify with a traffic growth rate as low
as 2% and with a discount rate as high as 20%, with the exception of a few links.
B. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
4.9   Key indicators of successful project implementation include inter alia: (i) jobs
created; (ii) lower road transport unit costs and vehicle operating costs attributable to road
condition improvements; (iii) timely and satisfactory completion of various categories of



- 51 -
road works financed under the project, as well as programmed rehabilitation and
maintenance of roads; (iv) increasing the percentage of classified roads in good or fair
condition over the five years period; (v) increased entrance of private local contractors
into the industry; (vi) funding levels; and (vii) certified completed training of road
engineers and technicians and employment of road engineers and technicians. Progress at
the institutional level will be monitored through completed studies, assessment of
achievements under the various Institutional Reform action plans, elaboration of a
manpower development plan, and regular progress reports. Monitoring of success will
also be carried out through the early elaboration of baseline data in selected areas (para.
3.4), subsequent surveys with communities and District Authorities (para. 3.7), and
consultations with the Advisory Road Board (para. 3.8) during the project execution
period.
4.10  A list of detailed time-bound and monitorable, quantitative and qualitative, project
and sector, project performance indicators to measure implementation success is included
in Annex 0, and has been agreed with GOL at negotiations. Specific measures and
yearly targets for each of these items have been defined, in particular those concerning
contracting out (in line with development of local contractors and restructuring of
selected Force Account units), length of routine and periodic maintenance for both the
paved and gravel networks, and corresponding funding figures and users charges.
C. POVERTY REDUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT GENERATION
4.11  The project supports upgrading, rehabilitating and maintaining roads in the
Highlands, which were identified in the Poverty Assessment Study as more poverty prone
than other parts of the country. About 37% of the upgrading road program concerns
CWS roads, mostly located in poorly served mountainous areas, which will result in
motor access where it previously did not exist, or only in the dry season. The upgrading
of RB and LCU roads concerns links between District towns in the same disadvantaged
areas. Those works are also expected to reduce transportation costs, which will benefit
the poor who could more easily become road transport users. Moreover, the FWP earth
tracks program and LHWP Development Fund program aim principally at these same
areas.
4.12 The poor will benefit from the safety net provided through productive
employment-generating labor-based works and local contractors-developed jobs. It is
estimated that the upgrading and rehabilitation of major roads and periodic maintenance
of paved roads will provide about 1,500 jobs over the 5-year period (90% of this labor is
likely to be Basotho, including 15% skilled, 25% semi-skilled and 60% unskilled).
Upgrading and rehabilitation works on rural roads, using labor-based techniques, will
create about 400,000 person days per year or about 1,200 permanent jobs-equivalent.
Moreover, all maintenance activities on LCU gravel roads (a third of the classified
network) will be carried out through labor-based methods by local contractors, all earth
roads be upgraded and maintained by communities' crews under the FWP program, and
labor-based routine maintenance will gradually be implemented on the classified RB



- 52 -
paved roads network, through labor-based methods by local contractors. The extension of
the maintenance system will create supplementary employment to farmers and village
people the country over for an estimated total equivalent to 1,500 permanent jobs
(comparatively more in the poorest areas), and numerous temporary jobs (1,500 jobs
equivalent) in maintenance which will be created at the grassroots level. In addition, the
CWS program will create about 4.8 million days of works through the road works
(including 1.8 million for upgrading works and 1 million for construction works), and
about 630,000 days of work through the construction of culverts and footbridges, which
is the equivalent of about 3,000 permanent jobs. The LHWP Development Fund program
is also expected to create a large number ofjobs with its currently estimated 550 km of
village roads construction and upgrading. The total permanent job-equivalent figure for
the whole of the road programs under the project amounts to about 6,000 permanent jobs
equivalent, or 2 million person days.
4.13  IDA-funding of the labor-based works concerns: (i) most contracts for the
rehabilitation of LCU gravel roads; (ii) a share of periodic maintenance of gravel roads;
and (iii) about 50% of the upgrading program from earth to gravel roads. Total IDA-
financing for labor-based civil works amounts to about US$10 million, i.e. about 40% of
its funding of road works.
D. DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL CONTRACTORS
4.14  The local contractors capacity to take over maintenance/rehabilitation works has
been assessed and is reflected in the implementation and financing plan. The local road
construction industry development strategy, which is based on the extension of the IEP-
implemented LCU pilot program, aims, besides its poverty reduction focus through the
further development of local contractors using labor-based techniques, at reducing unit
costs of road works associated with the expected increase in competition. Using private
contractors will enhance efficiency of maintenance operations, with the public sector role
being restricted to its natural design standards-setting, investment-programming,
technical supervision and quality control, and contract monitoring functions. An Action
plan will be included in the Implementation Manual after being reviewed prior to
effectiveness (para. 5.7). It will in particular focus on training in business management,
book keeping, site and plant management, and tendering (contract appreciation,
guarantees,...) based on series of in-house seminars and workshops (aimed at improving
the skills of both MOW personnel and local contractors), and hands-on training whereby
contractors are given stretches of road to either rehabilitate or maintain.
4.15  However, for technical and financial capacity reasons, periodic maintenance on
paved roads will be performed for the most part by more sophisticated regional
contractors proficient in the use of the required equipment-intensive techniques. RIU
would carry out minor resealing works on small sections during the initial period of the
road program, before being restructured/privatized. Moreover, the limited amount of
works in that category each year limits the possibility for contractors to invest upfront in
the necessary equipment. The creation of a sustainable local industry, through the



- 53 -
strategy to contract out to local contractors, cannot be applied initially to paved roads
(except routine maintenance), and to all categories of works on gravel roads. Concerning
paved roads, regional or overseas firms will carry out rehabilitation and upgrading from
gravel to paved standards, in addition to periodic maintenance. Upgrading of RB and
LCU unpaved roads will be initially carried out by regional contractors and force account
until domestic contractors have developed the capacity to take over. Careful packaging
and the use of alternative forms of contracting has been used to develop the local
contracting industry (paras 2.25 and 3.14), and standard bidding and contract documents
have been prepared for use under the project (para. 3.18).
E. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
4.16  The project comprises rehabilitation and upgrading of existing roads, not
construction of new roads, and direct environmental impacts should be minimal. The
bulk of the upgrading works concerns rural roads, which will undergo works to be mostly
carried out with labor intensive methods by small local contractors. Technical
specifications have been reviewed and found acceptable. Indirect impacts, that would
result if improving transport efficiency were to promote non-sustainable exploitation of
valuable or fragile resources, and lead to resources depletion and degradation of
important ecosystems, are expected to be negligible at the proposed levels of
rehabilitation and/or improvement. Improved maintenance under the project will have a
positive environmental impact. As no road realignment is envisaged, no resettlement is
expected to take place. Hence from an environmental standpoint, the project has been
classified in category "B". An Environment Analysis and Mitigation Plan has been
prepared and is included in Annex P.
4.17 Although the Ministry does not have sufficient environmental assessment or
management capacity at the present time, environmental concerns are handled by
consulting engineers. Environmental impact studies will be conducted, as part of the
design studies for the upgrading of existing roads, to assess the direct negative impacts
resulting from civil works and related activities such as excavation and borrow operations.
Moreover, careful monitoring of resettlement issues will be carried out as part of the
design studies for the upgrading of existing roads, which could result in minor
realignments due to earthworks and widening. Final engineering design would include the
necessary provisions to counteract both direct and indirect environmental and resettlement
impacts, and also ensure that contract documents contain apprpriate measures to mitigate
such adverse effects. Standard Terms of Reference, including specific environmental
clauses, have been prepared for surveys, feasibility and design studies, and supervision.
Standard bidding and contract documents to be used for all works will incorporate the
recommendations of the study on the socio-environmental aspects of LCU road works,
and include the necessary provisions to counteract both direct and indirect environmental
impacts. Standard bidding and contract documents have been agreed at negotiations.
4.18 The project will support strengthening GOL environmental analysis and
monitoring capacity in the roads sector. The Institutional Reform sub-component of the



- 54 -
project includes technical assistance to define environmental standards, quality control
procedures, and adapted design standards for road works (para. 2.28). This will support
the current effort of the Ministry of Works to work with the National Environmental
Secretariat to develop guidelines. Training will also be provided under the project to
design and supervision staff in environmental evaluation and monitoring of project
impacts (para. 2.40). A study on the socio-environmental aspects of LCU road work in
Lesotho has also been carried out, and its relevant findings will be included into the next
phases of the training program.
4.19  GOL has provided assurances at negotiations that they will: (a) prepare detailed
environmental guidelines, acceptable to IDA, before the mid-term review; and (b)
undertake road upgrading or construction investments, after an environmental assessment
has been carried out in accordance with environmental guidelines satisfactory to IDA, and
design standards and construction methods aimed at minimizing possible adverse
environmental impacts have been adopted (para. 5.6).
4.20 Implementation arrangements provide for annual reviews to be conducted each
year in order to determine which roads will undergo works in the next year. Pending
positive review, including inter alia the satisfactory completion of environmental
assessments, the detailed road programs for each year will be agreed.
F. SUSTAINABILITY
4.21  The sustainability of the project will depend on (i) the ability of the Road Fund to
provide for adequate and timely maintenance financing; (ii) the capacity of MOW to
restructure and manage more efficiently its operations, better plan interventions on the
road network, and retain qualified staff; (iii) the proper restructuring of the institutional
environment of MOW, and the creation of a more client-oriented approach; and (iv) the
development of local contractors. It is expected that improved cost recovery mechanisms
to fund maintenance, careful monitoring of the rehabilitation and maintenance program,
strengthened road management procedures, implementation of reorganized maintenance
systems, should ensure the implementation of a sustainable road management system.
This will be facilitated by IDA financing rehabilitation and a share of periodic
maintenance of rural roads during the early years of the project, and the strengthening of
the Road Fund under the project. Donor funding of upgrading works will be tied to GOL
meeting domestic funding, and satisfactory progress with institutional reform and
capacity building (paras 3.5 and 3.6).
4.22  Sustainability would stem in the short to medium term from continued
improvement in the implementation capacity in MOW, and close monitoring of the
transfer of technology from technical assistance (guidelines and objective indicators of
accomplishment will be agreed at negotiations). Sustainability of the program is being
supported by a carefully designed capacity building sub-component, including a
comprehensive training program focusing on both MOW staff and local contractors
(pw  2.25 and 2.40), the implementation of revised operational procedures (para. 2.36),



- 55 -
the elaboration of a manpower development plan (para. 2.39), and by addressing the long
standing issue of staff retention through short-term measures and logistical support (para.
2.36).
4.23  Emphasizing sectoral reform from the outset of the project, and proper phasing of
policy reforms vis a vis the relatively low absorptive capacity in Government (regrouping
road agencies, restructuring PVPS and the largest force account units, setting guidelines and
standards, and strengthening MOW's planning, financial and managerial capacity in the
early phase of the project, and subsequently creating an autonomous Road Authority and
strengthening the management and recovery procedures of the Road Fund) are key to the
sustainability of the road management institutional arrangements to be established under
the project. The project success will be enhanced by the creation of a group of
stakeholders interested in supporting and monitoring the program, and depends on its
ability to accurately sound users needs, and account for choices of representatives of
District Councils of isolated areas.
4.24  Creating an environment for sustainable road management requires the timely
development of an efficient local construction industry, which the project will specifically
support (paras 2.25 and 4.14) to avoid the risks of local contractors not developing fast
enough to meet the works increasing requirements.
G. PROJECT RISKS
4.25 A key risk is whether GOL will be able to finance the associated maintenance and
rehabilitation costs, and be able to manage the contracting out process associated with the
increase in maintenance activities. This would require sustained commitment to policy
reforms, and changes in financing procedures (recovery from road users via the Road
Fund). This risk is more generally linked to the uncertainty of the economic and political
environment in Lesotho, road works costs remaining high, or generated road traffic lower
than expected (and hence lower revenues). GOL would commit to at least raise the full
maintenance requirements from user charges (para. 2.50), which would require an
increase in the user charges without raising the cost of fuel to the consumer above the
corresponding cost in South Africa by more than 5%.
4.26  Achievement of project objectives and preventing delays in implementation rest
in part on the timing and extent of policy and institutional reforms, and the pace of
development of institutional and operational capacity in MOW, which currently remains
limited, in particular in contract management and works supervision. While the project
would include measures to continue local capacity building and MOW restructuring,
bringing about change is a medium to long-term effort. A strategy of utilizing short-term
technical assistance to compensate for the diminishing number of long-term expatriates,
combined with short-term training aimed at middle management, has been developed to
mitigate capacity constraints in the near-term (para. 3.12), while a longer-term capacity
development program focusing on human resources management is underway (para.



- 56 -
2.39). Up-front policy reforms have been included to manage the risks (para. 4.23), but
will not eliminate them.
4.27 Flexible overall project design and phased investment plans, combined with
annual formal project reviews have been used to mitigate the possibility of delays in
implementation and some of these uncertainty risks. If institutional development and
capacity building were slow, re-allocation of resources to the critical areas, and
modification of terms of reference will be introduced at annual reviews. Were the
implementation capacity to prove weaker than anticipated, funding not increased to a level
consistent with maintenance requirements, and institutional reforms delayed, the civil
works program will be implemented over a longer period or the outer years of the project
will be trimmed back accordingly after the mid-term review. Another risk is related to the
development of local contractors, especially with regard to the drain that the LHWP
Development Fund program could create on a still low number of contractors and already
limited works supervision capacity in MOW.
4.28 Institutional risks and mitigation actions are summarized in the table below:

Annex B
LETTER OF ROADS SECTOR POLICY
GOVERNMENT OF LESOTHO
Preamble
The kcy. problorno-faatd by thc roads sector lar the current injAequate overal levwel Qf
recurrent and investment budgets, the geographical and topographical formation of the
country which influences the allocation of expenditures to mainly benefit the major roads
in the lowlad, t*o undclpd cA             utu- resultiag in the laak of
inplamentation capacity, and the fragmented organizational structure resulting in an
uncoordinated management and planning of the road network. Government of Lesotho's
National Policy for Roads sets the pace for implementing the needed reforns to strsniline
the road sector organization and road maintenanr. and rehabilitation finding mechanism.
It is against this background that the Lesotho Government Road Sector, therefor, has the
foiowing objectives:
1.    Objectives for the Roads Sector
The overall objective Is tw have network capahbtw of buppuaLgiu Tiactond -cu,tusn"
activities, providing accessibility to communities, in particular those living in
isolated rural districts, and linking district towns. This implies the restoration of
the network to passable conditions everywhere.
Specific objectives of the Roads Sector are to:
(a)   faciitate and optmize traffic circulation, decrease vehicle opratng costs,
and reduce the probability of vehicle accidents, to the greatest exten
possible;
(b) enable vehiwcular access to all areas of the country particularly isolated
centrs of population;
(c)   create employnment through the utilization, wherever possible, of labor-
based methods of road construction and maintenance; and
(d)   enable the establishment in rural aeas of social infrastructures such as
whois, clici., an watArMuir  wppy )hm
The roads strategy, therefore focuses on strengthening the institutional capacity of
the Ministry of Works (MOW), reforrning the institutional environment, and
esablishing new financing mechanisms to ensure that roads agencies will have the
eapalty to manage and filly maintain the national road network by the end of the
decade.



Annex B
2.    Prcaea*4astitutional lcipons.ibilitiea
The national roads sector comprises the following Govemrnment agenciies:
(a)   Roads Branch;
(b)   Labor Construction Unit-
(c)   Civil Works Section;
(d)   Lesotho Highlands Development Authority, and
(e)   Municipal Authorities.
Prior tn 1968. the Rnoa  BrAinch (RR) w*t the qnAi (nvf:mimmant RagfflE cSayrng
out road works on a national level. Since that time, the Civil Works Section in
1968 and the Labor Construction Unit in 1977 have joined the Road Branch as
naional roads agencies, albeit at different levels of operation. The Roads Branch
is a department within the Ministry of Works and is currently responsible for the
ad-inistration of about 2,300 kIn of paved and gravelled gazetted roads.
The Labor Construction UTiit (LCU) is a depanment within the Ministry of Works
It differs from the finction of the Roads Branch in that it consucts and maintain
its road network using labourAased-methods (i.e. a combinaton of labor-intensive
and plant-based methods) and its consruction operations are carried out totaly in-
house. The LCU construct roads to an all-weather gravel standard and is
resonsib for the upgrading and maintenance of a road network, currently
estimated to cover about 850 km of gravel roads, and expected to evenataily cover
2,300 km.
The Civil Works Section (CWS) was established in 1968 for the purpose of
providing drought relief on a food for work basis. It fails under tho  instry of
Local Government and is responsible for the. construction and maintence of
some 1,570 km of eath roads and sections of gravel roads. In addition, the CWS
is also responsible for the construction of rural clinics and footbridge in isolated
The Lotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) falls within the Ministry
ofNatural Resoures, Its primary purpose is to administer the Lesotho fighlands



Annex B
Water Project. As part of these construction works, it has been necessry for the
LHDA to construct suitable access to their sites. In some cases this has meant
upgrading existing roads, and in other cases it has meant constructing totally now
roads. It is not a statutory roads authority, but it is nonetheless vested with the
responsibility of maintaining the roads it has construction up to the completion of
the appropriate phase of the project.
In accordance with the TowrnArul Country Phnmung A%.k uf1940, and the Urban
Goverunent Act of 1983, Municipal Councils are responsible for the planning and
control of urban roads. However. Maseru City Council is the only Municipal City
Council existing at the moment. At district level. the office the District so;rezy...
perfonrms the functiona of the  2uripit Council with regard to rouds, and the
works are carried on a sub-warrant basis by the Ministry of Works.
3.    Proposed Institutional and Capacity Building Arrangements
In the Ught of the foregoing, the Government strategy will in the short-term focus
on improving the performance of administrative bodies and in particular,
strengthening the institutional capacity of MOW by regrouping all road agencies
under its authority.
In the bsterwst of rationaliWng the current overlapping of agency responsibilities,
the Government will relocate the road and footbridge units of the Civil Works
Secdon fmnm the Ministry of Local Government, to the Ministry of Works. Thus,
wthn the firmework of o0cnm respamibility ftr roa administration curretly
exerVsd  by the Ministy of Works. two agencies will be established to restect the
two differen purposes of the road network, one of which will bau-espomuibiity
for roads witli nauDM fliportance, while the other will have responsibility for
roads with local importance
Another sategy is resources management and career development, forming
operating and planning/programuing procedures, and reallocating expndiu
toward maintance, in order for MOW agencies to be able to reinst  regular
routine and periodic maintenance on the entire road network by they.w 2,000.
This requires increasing financial comniunents to ensure that road are mdatained
to an adequate standard to preserve past invetments, and that development wthin
the toads sctor is based on environmentally sound practices.
Long-term davelopment will require the continued and successlzl implementaion
of a comprehensive manpower development plan and chnges in GOL's Psonnel
and Pay policies. While the last point is a general civil service reform issue, GOL
is committed to developing a strategy to retain qualified staff within the Roads
Seater, and to imlement an action plan inaluding various measures to improve
retention atqualfed staff



Annex B
In addition, Government is keen on facilitating the creation of an environment that
allows road agencies to operate on a commercial, autonomous and accountable
basis. The GOL is therefore committed to the established of an autonomous Roads
Authority in Lesotho, independently financed through user charges.
Concurrent with thisa ove, the Governmont will cofitinue with the long term
formation of two closely related lines of development:
(i)   the training and encouragement of the Local Road Construction
Industry to a size appropriae for the anount of work available, for
the purpose of eventually undertaking all routine and peiodic
maintenance in the country, as well as minor construction work;
through a gradual increase in contacting out activities, focuing
primarily on small contractors using labor-buad methods, and
truining of contractors, and
(u)   the associated reduction in goverunent activity in road consuction
and maintenance, which will be bued on a carsfi"ly plamed and
gradual restructuring of selected force account operation.
The Government recognizes the need to streamline the operations of the Plant and
VuiowPuut Sa-vicu (?YPS  antrwUll review the most appropriate form of
privatizing all or par; of this parastatal Ls part of the recntly enacted Privaization
DM11 199S. The GOL is committed to: (i) auctioning off PVPS heavy equipment
wthin a peiod of three years. and selling PVPS light equipment to local
contractors, in line with the Governmnt streogy to contra out road works,
before the fint batch of rehabilitation contracts are tendered, (a) asss the
conditions of decentralizing vehicles maintenance responsibility to each line
ministry, Ciii) rview the feasibiity of cntcnnS tho maintonce workshop into a
contract management, and (iv) reorganizing the procurement and managemet of
the fleet.
4.    National Roads Progam
Thd Ministry of Works has developed a National Roads Program whirths thr
following objectives:
(a)   to presev the road network fron further deterioration aring ftom lack

(c)   to carry out upgrading work on that pan of a classified road network
which is not all weather standard. in order to open access to isolated
priority areas in mountainous districts.
The programme is to be implemented over a five-year periodt from April 1996 to
March 2001, with support from the donor-funded Road Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Project (RJMP). The first two years will focus on rehabilitation and
reinstating maintenance on the whole classified network. An annual review of the
program will be held in March each year. This review will consider the
achievements during the put year and will agree on the work programme for the
following year. The overall target is to have stopped further deterioration of roads
currently in good or fhir condition by the year 2000. More specifically, the
Government is committed to gradually increasing the kilometen of roads under
routine maintenance from about 2.700 km in 1996/1997 to 3,500 km in
2000/2001, and reinstating annual periodic maintenance on about 120 km of paved
and 300 km of unpaved roads over the sane period. This will be achieved through
allocating suffcient fuanding from internal sources.
In order to achieve this in the medium ternm it is desirable that an independent
source of financing will be established for the management and development of the
roads in Leotho. The Government is, therefore, committed to creating an
autonomous Road Fund through legislation. It is envisaged that this Road Fund
will collect and allocate the revenues raised from road user charges (toil gates
border fees, SACU permits. supplementary heavy vehicle license fee, fizel charges,
-w.). The Govenment is also conunitted to maintain fll accountability and
transparency regarding the revenue flow from road users to the Road Fund. An
Advisory Road Board, which includes stakeholders from the govenment and
pnvae sector, will be created to assist Govenment in planning and monitoring
road expenditure. A fIll review of the Road Fund procedures will be undertaken
in 1997.
The roads sctor also constitutes an essential aspect of the Government's
deveopment statgy of poverty alleviation by providing employment through the
mwdmu use of labor-based methods for carying out the works. Hence. the
majority of roead works will be performed by local contractors. This is also in

Annex B
The National Transport Study has recently commented tlhat funding should bc
directed towards rehabilitating and maintaining thc Cxisting network, as new
construction is difficult to justify in stnctly economic terms.
In Lesotho, the most impurtant factor underiying the developing of road
infrastructure is the geographical and topographic formation of the country. This
LreZf1Us. the Ic"6rrxrTd svdulOITcm,T uC wIunaiun  aci.viyrhFdistribf Ut
population; and the costs of all types of road construction. The reliance on
conventional economic evaluation for road development, which has in the past
been one of the major influences in road development policy, has resulted in the
development of the present road network, in which the greater part of an improved
road (paved or a gravel) surface is concentrated in the western lQwlands and
foothills.
Government is committed to reverse this past trend of concentrating roads in the
western lowlands, which would tirther increase their compartive advantage,
exacerbate the drift of population to the lowland ares with all the attendant
potential social problems that this movement could bring, and maintain its
deleterious impact on the whole economy of tho country. To meet its key
objectives of poverty alleviation and improving access to basic savices in isolated
mountainous areas of the country, the Government. therefore supports a broader
based policy for road infastructure development, based on conventional economic
evaluation for main trunk roads, while adopting specific criteria for areu  with low
densites of population, low lves of vehicle trOafc and fairly l1aaod ooouomi
activity.
Concerning the upgrading of rural roads to all-weather standards by LCXJ the
highest priorty roads will be selected on the basis of population served, District
Council priority ranking, and trafic thresholds. In addi&iuni, rhubilitiLtion and
maintenance of village roads will be selected on the basis of communities'
participation in the identification, selection and implementation of project&
The following aspects will be reflected in the priority-setting of roas to be
upgraded or constructed as part of the CWS-managed Food for Work progran
and LHWP Development Fund program;
(i)   vehicle acces to connect population centers to the road network for
administrative and social purposes,
(*i)  the effect on the development of economic activity by eabling
improvements in productive sectors and the provision of acceus to markets;
(Wii)  the inceased emphasis in the use of labour based methods in conruction,
maintenance, upgrading and rehabilitation of roads for the cretion of



.4nnex B
emplovment with the closely associated aim of alleviation of pover?y
(iv)  the need for the provision of permanent river crossings (bridges and other
appropriate structures) to reduce the isoiation of communities, or to reduce
travel time between population centers;
(v)   the completion of the national strategic road network linking all regional
centers to each other and the national capital, with roads of at least all
weather capability, and
(vi)  the increaed emphasis on the need to minimize advers impact on
environrnent when carrying out all road works; and the increased emphasis
on fill gournmeni't ronanu wiiatwta pu Lu Lmp;urnnaion oiAS J a.a
The elaboration of these policies is contained in the national development plana,
and it is against these that the specific policy objectives for the road sector arm
established.
The overall strategy is. therefore, a carefi.d balance between maintaining the
current road network, and constructing and upgrading roads of appropriate
srtAndas to serve the needs of both the poorer members of society living in
inaccessible (often mountainous) areas, and also those of the economy at large.
63    Proposed Cost Recovery and Financing Arrangements
The Government's economic development strategy emphasizes the neod to return
to a syatem of market prices and to aim for full cost recovery for all economic
servics. In the roads sector. .the.past pattern-has been-to finance maintenance and
eait itation from general revenues. To meet the high financial requirements of
the road program Government will adually increase road user ohgcs over the
project period to cover all routine and periodic maintenance costs, black spot
improvemem, bridge repairs, and reviewing counterpart fLunding.
Under the project government will finance, from Road User Charges levied
through the newly-created Road Fund, 1 00% of routine maintenance on the whole
classified network. Periodic maintenance (including bridge repaurs) epnditres
will be nanced through the ame mechanism. However, it was agreed with 1DA

inancing agencies concerned. To meet the objectives of the maintenance and
rehabilitation program, the Road Fund is expected-to disburse sbout Maloti 36
million in 1996. The local contribution for the various road upgrading works is
estimated for 1996 at Maloti 1 million.
The incremental user charges to be channeled through the Road Fund include: an
average fuel charge raising total revenues of Maloti 31 nillion, i.e. a fuel charge of
respectively Lisente 39 per dicsel liter and Lisente 3 1 per petrol liter, the
breakdoum of Auhich will i o filly ri6tonninod lAre.r
Fines from enforcing axle-load regulations would be channeled to the Road Fund
once institutional arrangements for enforcement would have been implemented
under the Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project. The Road Fund will
mobilize for maintenance, rehabilitation and road safety improvement purposes at
lost  38 million in FY 1996/97, M40 million in FY 1997198, M44 million in FY
1999/99, M47 million in FY 1999/2000, MSS million in FY 2000/01, and M60
million per anum thereafter (in current Maloti figures).
7.    Enviromental Considerations
Because of the country's circumstances of a shortage of fertile crop land, heavily
degrded upland graing pastures, and widespread soil erosion, the Government is
sensitive to the need to ensure that road works do not have a negative impact on
the urounding environment. The Government therefore has determined that al
road works will be conducted to minimize adverse impact on the enAronment.
3.    Summary of Proposed Policy Actions
Tho Government's principal objecwve is to clear the larg backlog of madeance
work on the road network and to put the management and financing of road
maintenance on a sustainable long-term buis. To that end, it hu committed to;
(a)   reforming the institutional smtucure of the roads sector, which will require
to revise the road classification and esablish a gzetting mechanisn to
allocate responsibility for differont classes of roads to the vaious road
agences, and may entail to revise the 1969 Road Act as appropriae;
(b)   stregthening the implementation capacity for the various road ageCs

ROAD REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT
PROPOSAL TO PUT ROADS ON A FEE-FOR-SERVICE BASIS
Introduction
Allocations for road maintenance currently come from the government's consolidated budget. However,
given the growing size of the road program and the other urgent demands on the government's budget, it is simply
not possible to allocate sufficient funds for road maintenance from the consolidated budget. It has therefore been
agreed to gradually shift the road sector onto a fee-for-service basis under which road users would pay directly for
road maintenance. The aim is to ensure that: (i) sufficient funds are allocated for maintenance; (ii) maintenance
allocations cover all roads; (iii) financial discipline is strengthened to ensure that the public gets value-for-money;
and (iv) the fiscal burden on government is reduced to manageable proportions.
The fees (or road tariff) will consist of an access fee - road toll-gate fees, border fees/short-term SACU
permits, license fees on motor vehicles and a supplementary heavy vehicle license fee, and fines on overloaded
vehicles - and a user fee in the form of road maintenance levy collected on all transport fuels. General budget
funds would be reserved for upgrading, improvement, and new construction. Since the above charges are not
regular taxes, but fees-for-service, the proceeds from the road tariff will be deposited into a special fund which has
been established as the Road Fund by Legal Notice No 179 of 1995 published in the Government Gazette. The
regulations of the Road Fund have been gazetted in Legal Notice No 16 of 1996. The notice specifies the purpose
of the special fund, its sources of revenues, and how the fund will be managed. It has been agreed that the Road
Fund will be pro-actively managed by a representative board of management. The Board has been created within
the framework of the Legal Notice No 16 of 1996, and is assisted by a full-time independent Secretariat which will
manage the day-to-day affairs of the Road Fund, and monitor all revenues and expenditures on behalf of the Board.
The Board reports to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and will generally advise the Minister on all matters
pertaining to the financing of roads. In the medium term (expected to be two years), based on experience with the
Board, MOF would seek to bring forward legislation to turn the Board into an autonomous board managing the
Road Fund in an executive capacity.
Expenditures to be Financed
Revenues from the Road Fund will primarily be used to finance routine and periodic maintenance and
rehabilitation of the classified road network, together with maintenance of selected Village Councils roads, and
selected road safety projects. Village Council roads include those under the jurisdiction of the Civil Works Section
(CWS) of the Ministry of Local Government as well as roads where the Village Council agrees to make their
contribution to maintenance through a cost sharing arrangement. Village Councils will be expected to contribute
50 percent towards the cost of maintaining Village Council roads, and may choose to do so by contributing direct
labor. District Councils will be expected to contribute 50 percent towards the cost of maintaining urban roads
using revenues from rates and other local taxes. Road fund revenues may be used to finance rehabilitation, but will
only be used to finance road upgrading and new works, once all road maintenance requirements have been met.
Source of Revenues
Revenues will come from five main sources: (i) road toll-gate fees collected on all vehicles leaving
Lesotho, including GOL vehicles; (ii) border fees/short-term SACU permits charged on all foreign trucks entering
Lesotho; (iii) license fees on motor vehicles and a supplementary license fee collected from heavy vehicles to
ensure they pay in full for the damage they do to the road pavement; (iv) fines on overloaded vehicles; and (v) a
road maintenance levy added to the price of all transport fuels, including the fuel consumed by government.



Annex C
Lesotho cannot raise its fuel prices above those prevailing in South Africa and it attempts to keep the price of fuel
at least 5 lisente below the South African level. Since the prices of petrol and diesel in Lesotho are currently 20
lisente and 12 lisente below those in South Africa, there is scope for adding a road user charge of 15 and 7 lisente
respectively to the current price of petrol and diesel without reducing the relative margin between Lesotho and
South Africa to less than 5 lisente. Although the relative prices between Lesotho and South Africa vary, the
current differentials have been used to estimate the composition of the road maintenance levy.
The Road Fund Board
The Board consists of a chairman and eleven members who have been appointed by the Minister of
Finance. Six members represent concerned government departments and five will represent non-governmental
organizations. The government members have been nominated by their Principal Secretaries (Ministries of
Finance, Economic Planning, Works, Transport & Communications, Local Government, and Natural Resources).
The non-governmental members have been nominated by the organizations they represent (Chamber of Commerce
and Industry; Bus and Mini-bus Association; Transport Association; Architects, Engineers and Surveyors
Association; and Law Society). Additional non-voting members may be co-opted to the Board when required.
Members of the Board are appointed for a period of two years and will be compensated for the time spent attending
board meetings. Board meetings will be held at least once a month and will have four sub-comnmittees: Road
Safety, Environment, Engineering, and Road Fees.
Management of the Road Fund
In general, funds from the Road Fund will only be disbursed for goods and services forming part of an
approved maintenance program. Each check withdrawing funds from the road fund will be signed by two people:
one from the Advisory Board and the other from MOF. Work undertaken by contractors will be certified by a
registered engineer before payment is made. Road agencies will transmit requests for payment to the road fund
secretariat (copy to MOF) who will arrange to pay the contractor directly out of the road fund account. Work
undertaken by force account will be subject to similar financial controls.
The Board will review the annual expenditure programs put forward by the various road agencies and
decide, in light of these requests and in consultation with MOF, on the overall size of the road program to be
financed through the road fund. Based on these revenue requirements, it will then recommend to MOF the
required levels of the supplementary licenses and road maintenance levy. The Board will also recommend how the
revenues from the road fund should be sub-divided between the various road agencies entitled to draw from the
road fund, including those dealing with road safety.
The Board will negotiate agency agreements with of the Department of Customs and Department of
Transport and Traffic for collection of road toll-gate fees, border fees/short-term SACU permits, motor vehicle
license fees and supplementary heavy vehicle license fees. The agreements will provide for fees to be directly
deposited into a designated account at the Central Bank. The road maintenance levy (added to the price of fuel)
will be collected by the oil companies in South Africa and paid directly into a designated account at the Central
Bank.
The accounts and other financial statements of the road fund will be audited annually by a firm of auditors
selected by the Auditor General. The audited annual accounts, which will eventually include a Statement of
Income, a Balance Sheet, and a Statement of Cash Flow, will be published within three months of the end of each
financial year. The audit will include a full financial audit and a selective technical audit. The Board will also
publish an annual report within six months of the end of each financial year, dealing generally with the policies
and activities of the Board during the year, and including a copy of the audited accounts and the auditors report on
the accounts.

ROAD REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT
SUPERVISION PLAN
IDA Supervision Input:
Bank staff or consultant input into the supervision of the project will amount to about 15 staff
weeks per annum.
On average two 2-week 1-person missions and one 2-week 3-person mission will be required each
year throughout the project life. Each mission will include the Project Task Manager, and the 3-person
mission will include in addition: (i) a Financial Analyst, responsible for monitoring the project financial
accounts, reviewing progress with the establishment of financial and contract management procedures by
the FCMU, and monitoring the RF disbursement, management and accounting procedures; and (ii) a Road
Engineer, responsible for assessing progress with maintenance and rehabilitation works, reviewing the
programming system and the annual PMMS results, and monitoring the revised road management and
maintenance procedures established in the road agencies and their regional offices.
Further expertise -estimated on average at about 5 weeks of additional field supervision per
annum- will be required in: (i) training and manpower development, (ii) institutional development (Road
Authority, privatization of MOW units, concession of the PVPS workshop), (iii) definition of
environmental standards and assessment of environmental analysis conducted for major civil works; and
(iv) review of surveys and beneficiary assessments.
In addition to supplement the usual IDA supervision, assistance will be sought from CVP and the
RMI Unit on institutional issues (in particular the Road Fund and the establishment of a commercially
oriented Road Authority). A team of Bank staff (Lawyer, Disbursement Officer, Environment Specialist)
will participate in the mid term review, and advise at annual reviews throughout the project. The lawyer
will participate in the project launch workshop. The Lesotho Country Team will be requested to advise in
issues raised during supervision.
Portfolio Management Operations:
The review of procurement documents, progress reports, studies reports, and financial statements
at headquarters, and correspondence and intemal reporting related to such activities, are estimated to
require about 15 staff weeks per annum.
Field Supervision:
It is planned to undertake field supervision missions three times per annum. The plan is shown
below. The supervision of the project will cover the following broad aspects:
(i)    Policy Environment: Reviewing the policy and institutional environment, and ensuring that the
different recommended reforms are satisfactory and consistent with each other will absorb significant
resources.
(ii)   Project Implementation: Because of the nature of the project, three supervision missions will be
required per annum for the entire five-year period.
(iii)   Donor Co-ordination: Meetings will be organized during each supervision mission with donors to
ensure that all donors are working harmoniously towards the same common goal.



Annex M
Other Donors' Supervision Input:
A mechanism will be developed to allow donors to coordinate their supervision activities. Attempts
will be made to get donors to fund consultants for the road transport and PVPS restructuring sub-
components.
Borrower's Supervision Input:
MOW will provide IDA with quarterly progress reports in the agreed format. All procurement
documents will be based on the adopted standard documents. All procurement evaluations submitted to
IDA for review will be accompanied by a cover note setting out all the information required for review and
other internal IDA reporting requirements (e.g. Form 384) in the agreed summary form. MOW will provide
IDA with annual audit reports of the project special accounts, in the format and time schedule specified in
the credit agreement. Three weeks prior to each mission, IDA will submit to GOL requirements for the
mission review.

LESOTHO
ROAD REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT
SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF ROAD INVESTMENTS
Benefits: The direct benefits from upgrading roads to paved or engineered gravel standards are mainly the
economic benefits accruing to roads having reached a certain traffic threshold (in this case AADTs -annual
average daily traffic- of respectively 400 and 150). However, cost-benefit analysis for upgrading rural roads does
not show high economic returns, particularly in the mountainous areas, due to the currently low traffic volumes
and the relatively higher cost of civil works. Ancillary benefits range from (i) improved transport and mobility to
and between villages and population centers not currently connected to the overall road network, (ii) use of labor-
based methods resulting in the creation of employment (iii) year-around access to basic services in areas which are
now isolated during the rainy season; and (iv) stimulation of agricultural production in areas which had limited
access prior to upgrading and lack of timely transport services. The direct benefits from rehabilitation and
maintenance will be a reduction in vehicle operating costs (VOCs), which will, in turn, be translated into lower
transport costs for the movement of people and products. Rehabilitation works tackle: (i) deferred periodic
maintenance of gravel roads, which mainly affected those roads with AADTs ranging from 100 to 300; and (ii)
strengthening selected heavy-trafficked paved trunk roads (with AADTs above 5,000) to avoid deterioration caused
by heavy trucks from the RSA where the legal axle-load limit is 50% higher than in Lesotho. Road maintenance
will prevent deterioration of the existing structures to continue, and avoid further increasing VOCs and cost of
future rehabilitation. In addition, maintenance of rural roads, which is by nature labor intensive and will be carried
out by small local contractors and village crews, will generate substantial employment opportunities and provide a
steady income to many local inhabitants. Since project works will be spread widely throughout Lesotho, most parts
of the country will benefit from the employment generated by the Project.
Costs: The economic analysis includes routine and periodic maintenance costs at a level sufficient to ensure that
estimated road-user savings from improved surfaces will indeed be realized. However, unit costs are relatively high
due to terrain conditions, and due to cost of labor for labor intensive works such as maintenance. There is some
uncertainty over those costs because few local contractors -who are to carry out the bulk of maintenance works-
have been employed until now. Base costs for rehabilitation and upgrading works have been estimated from recent
civil works contracts in the Roads Branch (RB) and Labor Construction Unit (LCU) estimates.
Economic Viability: As mentioned above, economic viability differs widely for major roads and rural low-volume
roads. Average daily traffic levels on most rural roads under consideration for upgrading are low at present,
particularly in the Highlands which are priority targets for improving access. This is due primarily to the poor
condition of roads. Therefore, a key variable in determining the required level of upgrading for the rural roads, and
the economic viability thereof, is the assumed rate of traffic increase. Without an increase in traffic levels,
substantial investments would not be viable. In order to maximize the likelihood that investment in rural roads
upgrading will at least be viable, even if not always optimal, and to stretch available resources as far as possible,
upgrading of gravel roads has been designed with regard to the minimum MOW 5-meter width standards, and 3.5-
meter width for earth tracks being built under the Civil Works Section (CWS) program. Geometric design
standards for roads to be rehabilitated will be kept to the original "as-built" standards. Upgrading of main gravel
roads to paved standards includes widening to standard widths justified by the high traffic volumes. Based on
minimal rehabilitation works and upgrading works adjusted to terrain and weather conditions, carefully assessed
unit costs for all categories of works, and reasonable assumptions as to future traffic volumes, the analysis indicates
that road works have an economic rate-of-return in excess of the estimated opportunity cost of capital (12%). It has
been assumed in the base case that traffic will gradually increase at a moderate average rate of 4%.
Methodology: Basic data required for input to the Pavement Maintenance Management System (PMMS) and the
HDM model was collected during preparatory studies and revised at appraisal. This comprised the network

Annex N
Costs were considered in both financial and economic terms. The economic analysis used appropriate shadow
prices (after adjusting for taxes, and transfer payments). To convert the financial costs items to economic costs, the
following conversion factors were applied: (i) 81.3% for materials and transport and equipment to take account of
sales tax (GST), fuel taxes and the SACU tariffs; (ii) 50% for the labor cost on unpaved roads; and (iii) 75% for the
labor cost on paved roads, to take account of the different skill levels required to carry out works.
Projects in each category have been selected based on how they best fit the overall priorities of the program, and on
the following criteria: (i) a "corridor" rationale implying that all major links receive some kind of treatment to
ensure a certain level of continuity in the network, (ii) ongoing programs (Lesotho Highlands Water Project-
LHWP, LCU program, Development Fund program, and Food for Work Program-FWP), and (iii) road condition
and traffic flows. The analysis also considered: (i) the managerial capacity in MOW and in each regional office of
the RB, LCU and CWS, (ii) the availability of local contractors, and (iii) the availability of national and external
funding.
The economic analysis for the RB and LCU roads was conducted (para 4.2 of the SAR) using the IEP-developed
PMMS, after updating its data base in terms of traffic estimates and unit costs, traffic growth figure revised from
the National Transport Study (NTS) projections of 6 to 7% for the next five years to a more realistic 4%, and road
condition estimates for the CWS gravel and earth roads network which were not yet entered in the data base). The
analysis included a run of the Bank HDM program, which generally produced consistent results with the PMMS. A
reassessment of the vehicle characteristics and operating costs in terms of HDM III requirements has to be carried
out to calibrate the model for the Lesotho fleet. The RB-PMMS VOC data were determined for the customised
South African model. To determine the maintenance requirements for the network and the feasibility of
rehabilitation and upgrading of road links, the following process was carried out:
(3     Road functional and structural evaluation - uniform sections in terms of roughness and surface damage
were identified and the strengthening for a 15 year project period were determined;
(Z     Maintenance, Rehabilitation and Upgrading operations were identified and assigned to categories;
a3)    Unit Rates were reviewed based on material, labour and equipment components for each of the
maintenance and rehabilitation activities included in the strategies;
()     The various interventions, their effect and unit costs, were defined and transferred to HDM III formats;
(J)    Thresholds for the condition and traffic responsive interventions were established for three service levels;
0      Strategies were established for each maintenance category, and assigned to the road sections.
tS3    HDM III performance simulation was carried out over 20 years for each road link subjected to routine and
periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading strategies.
The PMMS and HDM analysis also determined appropriate maintenance options for RB roads. The final selection
of maintenance works (periodic maintenance on roads and bridges in good or fair condition, and routine
maintenance extended on an increasing basis to the whole classified network) will be based on the PMMS results
(priority works to be carried out according to specific road deterioration factors found in Lesotho and emergency of
treatment), the potential for contracting out (assumed to be increasing over the five year period with the
development of local contractors, and improved managerial capacity of MOW), and available Road Fund resources.
A tentative maintenance program has been defined, based upon different maintenance activities required for each
type of road and surface.
A complete list showing all projects yielding a positive net present value (NPV) between years 1996 and 2015 is
included in the Implementation Manual. The final selection has focused on ensuring that investments made are
high priority, and major works (rehabilitation and upgrading) are all economically viable. The selection of roads to
undergo rehabilitation works (backlogged maintenance of gravel roads) was made, ensuring that there would not
be any overlapping with those selected for potential periodic maintenance, and emphasizing the need to rehabilitate
before embarking on a more comprehensive upgrading program. As described in Chapter IV of the SAR, the final
selection of upgrading works will be based on completed detailed engineering design, committed donors financing,
and further economic analyses for the eight major upgrading sub-projects.
The table below shows the expected average Internal Economic Rates of Return (IRR), NPVs and NPV/Cost ratios
for different types of works for the base case scenario, which assumes 4% traffic growth and a 12% discount rate.



Annex N
The historical traffic growth rate of 6% was not used, to take account of the uncertainty in traffic patterns which
may result from factors such as reduction of trade with South Africa and drought. The average ERR in all cases is
in excess of the estimated opportunity cost of capital of 12%.

Rural road upgrading program: The analysis of the economics of low-volume CWS-managed rural roads reveals
economic rates of return often lower than 12%. The total length of rural roads to be upgraded by LCU to all-
weather standards is expected to be 400 km, mostly in Highlands districts. This is estimated to be about 30 percent
of the kilometrage of secondary and tertiary roads, and approximately 10 percent of the national network. Given
the large number of individual roads and the lack of complete data, a detailed economic analysis could not be
conducted for each road section. Instead, first a general analysis has been performed based on a screening process
by LCU which takes the following factors, both socio-economic and technical, into account: the road will be
classified as a LCU road, lack of roads within four kilometers, availability of labor, linkage to development
projects, location in an underdeveloped area, potential enhancement of agricultural productivity and augmenting
the standard of life, information on terrain (mountainous/hilly, flat or rolling), present condition (motorable, partly
motorable or not motorable), drainage structures, percent of road needing gravelling and sources of gravel. Once
this screening done, the second step consists of a priority ranking, according to the following standardized
prioritization criteria (population served, District Council priority ranking, and traffic level), defined as follows:
(i)    the District Development Councils (DDCs) were given a list of LCU roads within their district to
prioritize in accordance with local knowledge regarding access needs, social infrastructure, and rural
development initiatives, and these roads were ranked in order of importance by each DDC. A dialogue
with the newly elected Village Development Councils (VDCs) will be initiated under the project with
regard to the FWP and LHWP Development Fund programs,
(ii)    seven-day 12 hour traffic counts are regularly carried out on all motorable alignments, and were recently
checked as part of the elaboration of the PMMS under the IEP-financed project. Roads were ranked in
order of most-to-least traffic for each district; and
(iii)   population statistics (area population density, which also reflects the availability of casual workers) were
obtained for the corridor of influence for each road, as determined from the 1986 census.
The ranking procedure gave equal weightings to each of the above individual rankings, and the overall ranking
was arrived at by numerically summing the ranking given to each of the three items. The smaller the sum, the
greater the importance of the road. Developing a work program for a rural road network must, however, also
involve the balancing of a number of influencing factors such as: (i) connecting links between village access roads
and social facilities and transport corridors, emphasizing the increase in links and transport services within rural
areas; (ii) management and supervisory capability; and (iii) the need to preserve investment on substantially
maintainable roads. The final selection of roads to be upgraded in priority (416 km estimated with regard to LCU
and contractors capacity) therefore included a final review with regard to two criteria: (i) roads with AADTs over
50 and/or projects based on acceptable IRRs when available, and (ii) costs. To meet the broader GOL objectives
related to the promotion of labor intensive methods and improving access, a shadow price for labor and a factor
"length of good road per head of population" were included into the costing process, which did not bear a
significant impact on the ranking of the roads. The programs will be reviewed annually using the above-described
procedure.



Annex N
Beneficiaries: From the above, the main beneficiaries will be road users in general (lower VOCs. improved access
roads), rural communities in isolated mountainous areas of the country (expanded all-weather year-round access to
basic services, jobs in maintenance and upgrading activities), and local contractors (stable flow of civil works
contracts, improved access to equipment, training and support to development of the industry).
Sensitivity Analysis: Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the impact of: (i) variations from the basic unit
costs; (ii) variations from the initial normal-traffic volumes; and (iii) the effect of various discount rates. The
following table shows the results for two alternatives and the base case; one with 2% traffic growth rates, and one
with 6% traffic growth; and one with 8% discount rate and one with 16% discount rate. Results are shown for RB
rehabilitation program, and the RB upgrading to paved standards program. In all cases the project is economically
justified. The table below shows the estimated financial costs of the chosen option and the NPV and IRR in the
base case and in traffic and discount rate alternatives: (i) traffic growth rates of 2%. 4% and 6%, and (ii) discount
rates of 8%, 12 %, 16% and 20% for the paved roads and from 8%, 12% and 16 % for the unpaved roads.

Cost Recovery: A Road Fund (Annex C) has been established to recover maintenance and rehabilitation costs
from users through 4 charges (fuel charge, border fees, road-toll gate fees, supplementary licensing fee). The later
will apply to heavv vehicles, which have been found to be the only vehicles with a negative difference between
variable road maintenance costs and variable VOCs. i.e. creating more damages onto roads than paid for through
current fuel taxes. The Road Fund mechanism also includes cost-sharing arrangements for urban and village roads,
to extend benefits to local communities.

The number of LCU qualified contractors after 1999 could be lower depending on successful maintenance contractors being retrained
in roads upgrading, the number of remaining force account units, and the degree of competition introduced in the country

ROAD REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION
EA Screening
The Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project is in EA Category B which requires an
environmental evaluation and mitigation plan under the Bank OD 4.01, Environmental Assessment. In lieu
of national environmental assessment legislation which is being developed by the National Environmental
Secretariat, Bank guidelines were used for the environmental analysis for this project. Bank missions
discussed the development of EA legislation with the Environment Department in the Ministry of
Environment and Natural Resources.
The project focuses on rehabilitation, maintenance and upgrading of existing roads and no new
roads will be constructed. Construction methods will employ labor intensive techniques using local labor
and small contractors which is commonly utilized in Lesotho under the Local Construction Unit of the
Ministry of Works (LCU). Negative environmental and social impacts due to the project are expected to be
minimal because of the focus on rehabilitation and non-mechanized construction, hence the EA
classification of Category B.
The primary environmental concems consist of erosion control and avoidance of destruction of
natural vegetation which may be rare or endangered in Lesotho. The primary social concems is disruption
of travel due to construction and the potential for disturbing or taking of agricultural land as a result of
construction.
Environmental Analysis
With funding by SIDA, the Ministry of Works contracted a Socioeconomic and Environmental
Impact Analysis of the Local Construction Unit activities. The consultants were contracted locally. The
analysis consisted of a meter by meter environmental inspection of 10% of the roads rehabilitated by the
LCU and a survey of 496 households which wvere affected by the LCU road rehabilitation program. It was
decided that this on-going work would satisfy Bank requirements for environmental analysis and that any
further work would have been redundant.
The analysis found that generally the road rehabilitation work was adequate and that environmental
protection, while not a specific charge of the LCU, was routinely incorporated into design and contract
documents. Most of the households expressed satisfaction with the work and only a small percentage felt
that they lost land or amenities as a result of the road work. Surprisingly, only 11 of 496 households noted
any problems with erosion. One more serious environmental point was the failure to restore borrow areas to
a more useful condition. Far too often the borrow pits were simply abandoned causing hazards to humans
and livestock.



Annex P
Conclusions and Recommendations
The communities in the road corridors are ovenvhelmingly satisfied with the roads and the routes.
The communities value the improved accessibility and decreased travel time more than the potential for
commercial or economic development. The survey also shows that while the local construction policy is
appreciated in the communities, the direct and indirect impacts have been minimal because of the limited
number of households providing labor and the short duration. However, the survey does show that
improved skills from the construction was highly regarded by respondents. It was also noted that the LCU
employment was found to be very equitably distributed.
Given the steep gradient topography, high rainfall and erodable soils, erosion in Lesotho is a
natural part of the weathering process and would be quite severe without human habitation and use.
Farming and overgrazing make the erosion rate more intolerable and there is great concern that road work
does not unnecessarily contribute to more erosion. LCU roads tend to follow natural contours so that
erosion is reduced and good drainage where possible keeps the losses to acceptable limits. However, the
focus of the erosion control has been more on roadway protection and less on what happens to run off after
it leaves the roadway. This lack of attention to off-road protection does cause erosion losses in field below
the road and LCU must expand it's attention to more devices that will dissipate run-off energy as it leaves
the road.
The analysis did show that much of the environmental damage was due to a lack of, or deferred,
maintenance rather than to inappropriate design, construction techniques or materials. The lack of
systematic light maintenance leads to rapid deterioration of drainage structures which in turn increases the
likelihood of erosion problems.
A disquieting finding of the road inspection is that in several areas, vegetation had been
unnecessarily trampled by the construction crews and trucks. In some cases, the vegetation included Aloe.
One of the two species of Aloe in Lesotho is endemic to Lesotho and is an endangered species. The
construction crews have to be better trained in respect to protecting natural vegetation.
Mitigation
LCU has recently constructed two training centers for staff and local contractors. Part of the
training includes erosion control techniques. LCU has also agreed to review the Socio-economic and
Environmental Report and incorporate the recommendations into the training program. As a result, LCU is
likely to strengthen the components on erosion control. It is also likely that they will be able to add training
material on restoration of borrow areas and include requirements for such restoration in their contract
documents. LCU will seek assistance from the Environment Department of the Ministry of Environment
and Natural Resources to include training components on recognition of valuable and endangered
vegetation. Assurances for these recommended practices will be sought during negotiations.
The most important aspect of mitigation for road rehabilitation work is to have on-site supervision
and monitoring with respect to environmental concerns. LCU will continue to improve in this area through
internal training at the training centers. The curriculum will be adjusted to include the materials
recommended in the socioeconomic and environmental impact study. Supervision forms could also be
amended to include certain environmental and social parameters for reporting from the field to
headquarters.
