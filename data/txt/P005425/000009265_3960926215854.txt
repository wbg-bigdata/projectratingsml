MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
CF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A SECOND SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.       The foll3wing report on a proposed loan co the Kingdom of Morocco of
US$23.0 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan will carry the
Bank's standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 20 years including 5
years grace and will helo finance a Second Small and Medium Scale Irrigation
Project.
2.       Background.  Agriculture in Morocco accounts for about 172 of GDP, a
third of merchandise exports and provides 40Z of all employment. The
performance of the agriculture sector has been uneven. Food production has
bee.a affected by droughts and has failed to keep pace with the increased
domestic demand generated by a rapid population growth, high rate of
urbanization and declining real prices for food; food imports have increased
and self-sufficiency ratios have fallen to SOZ for cereals and to 152 for
edible oils. Altogether, agricultural imports now account for about 25% of
merchandise imports.  In response to the poor performance of the sector, the
Government initiated a medium term adjustment program in 1985 with the
objective of:  (a) :estructuriig t'e public investment and expenditure program
in agriculture; (b) correcting the prices and incentives framework; (c)
strengthening the agricultural support services: (d) building up institutional
capacity for agricultural policy planning and analysis and strengthening the
organization and structure of the agricultural sector; and (e) helping resolve
the basic issues of improving productivity of land use and protecting the
natural resource base. The Bank is strongly supporting this program through
two agricultural sector adjustment lgans. Increased productivity for crops in
which Morocco has a comparative advantage in both rainfed and irrigated areas
-the latter cover only 102 of the cultivable land but provide 452 of the
sector value added- is an essential component of this strategy.
3.       While the major part of the investment budget in the agricultural
sector during the 1970's was in large scale irrigation (65% of total sector
investments and 902 of investment in irrigation), in the 1980's the Government
has placed increased emphasis on investment in schemes that have a short
gestation period, have low unit development cost, and impose a low burden on
the Government in terms of operation and maintenance. The rehabilitation of
small and medium scale irrigation schemes meets these criteria. The
Directorate for Rural Engineering (DER) in the Ministry of Agriculture and
Agrarian Reform (MARA), through its Service for Small and Medium Scale
Irrigation, is responsible for the formulation of annual programs and
overseeing design, while the Provincial Directorates of Agriculture (DPA) and
Regional Offices for Agricultural Development (ORMVA) are responsible for
project construction and subsequent operation and maintenance working with
Irrigation Water Users Associations.

4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Project is in line with the
public investment strategies adopted under the medium term sectoral adjustment
program which is supported by the Bank, and it particularly furthers the goals
of irrigation development policy including the up-grading of traditional small
and medium scale irrigation schemes which meet agreed selection criteria.
Since the majority of farm families on these schemes are poor it is a good
vehicle for mitigating rural poverty. The project continues efforts to
strengthen Government agencies responsible for SMSI development launched in
1983 under the first small and medium scale irrigation project (Loan 2253-MOR).
5.       Project Obiectives.  The central objective of the proposed project is
to pursue and strengthen the systematic approach to the development of small
and medium scale irrigation that was initiated with the first project. The
project would: (a) support Government policy concerning the upgrading of
traditional small and medium scale irrigation schemes meeting the criteria
defined under the second sector loan; (b) strengthen the Government agencies
at the central and provincial level, which are responsible for small and
medium scale irrigation development; (c) promote the creation of water user
associations to be responsible for the operation and maintenance of irrigation
networks and for cost recovery.
6.       Project Description.  The proposed project would support the
Government's Investment Program in Small and Medium Scale Irrigation (SMSI)
over a 5 year period through:  (a) renovation and upgrading of about 120
traditional SMSI schemes totalling about 32,000 hectares, of which nine (8,000
hecLares) are expected to be spate irrigation schemes in the more
underdeveloped semi-arid areas; (b) eo.uipping 7 spate irrigation repair and
maintenance brigades in selected southern provinces; (c) providing vehicles
and equipment for MARA's Central Management Unit (DER) and for the Provincial
Agricultural Directorates concerned with implemp.Ling renovation schemes; and
kd) funding technical assistance, staff trainirg and studies for DER and DPA
staff dealing with SMSI activities and funding design work carried out by
local consulting firms. The project has been designed as a subsector program
operation and was appraised on the basis of feasibility studies for four
schemes totalling 7,800 hectares which make up the first year's program. The
remaining subprojects would be selected according to agreed criteria, prepared
and appraised during project implementation. The preparation of each
subsequent annual program will in-lude the iritial selection by Provincial
Agricultural Directorates and Regional Irrigation Offices of perimeters to be
renovated, feasibility studies with specific investigations and preliminary
technical studies when necessary, environmental impact assessment, evaluation
of a selected sample of subprojects and of feasibility studies and approval of
the annual program by the Bank, and preparation of detailed designs and
bidding documents. The provision of spate irrigation repair and maintenance
brigades will build on experience with a pilot project financed by FAO in
1986/87. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$44.9 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$15.8 million (352). A
breakdown of cost and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
method of procurement and disbursements, as well as the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project plocessing events and the
status of Bank group operations in Morocco are given in Schedule C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
6902-MOR (dated May 16, 1988) is being distributed separately.

7.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following actions:
(a) selection of future subprojects on the basis of the following criteria:
(i) all projects should be for rehabilitation of existing SMSI schemes; (ii)
only those schemes where small to middle-size farms are predominant will be
rehabilitated; (iii) the general criterion for project acceptability would be
an economic rate of return of at least 12X, except for those pro4ects which
cover less than 100 ha for which the criterion would be that investment
expenditures do not exceed US$1500 (DH 12,000)/ha in 1987 prices; (iv) works
for any project should be implemented over a period of two years or .ess; and
(v) the beneficiaries have established Water Users' Associations and
Government has made arrangements with the association to ensure proper
execution of works, operation and maintenance and collection of water charges;
(b) retention of the Project Consultative Coordinating Committee and Project
Coordination and Monitoring Unit set up under the first project; and (c)
application of agreed cost recovery formulae (recovery of lO0 of O&M and at
least 10X of investment costs over 30 years). The strengthening of the
project coordination and monitoring unit set up under the first project will
be a condition of effectiveness.
8.       Justification.  Economic benefits would stem from increased crop and
livestock production by the 9,800 farm families expected to participate
directly in schemes rehabilitated under the project. Many of these families
are below the rural poverty level. The project would help develop a
sub-sector wide approach to sub-project selection, appraisal, implementation,
and monitoring and rationalization of the role of Government agencies in the
management of SMSI schemes, and increasing farmer participation in operation
and maintenance. The project would be expected to slow the rural exodus from
semi-arid areas, and would have a positive environmental impact in areas
threatened by desertification and in areas where spate irrigation works would
recharge groundwater aquifers.
9.       Risks.  Possible risks would derive from (a) budgetary shortfalls and
(b) from institutional weaknesses. Continued budgetary problems could prevent
Government adequately funding its share of project cost which could delay
sub-project implementation. However in view of Government's expressed policy
of emphasizing small and medium scale irrigation investmer , as well as
arrangements made under the second sector loan for counterpart funds, the risk
is minimal. Moreover, the expected provision of bilateral cofinancing to meet
a considerable portion of local costs will ease the Government's financial
burden. The institutions involved are relatively small and untested and this
could lead to delays particularly in the design phase. To avoid this risk
funds have been provided under the loan for employing local consulting firms
for up to 50% of the design work and DER staff is to be reinforced. The Bank
will also review selected feasibility studies prior to execution.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
