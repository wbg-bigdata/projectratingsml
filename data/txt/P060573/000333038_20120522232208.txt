I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

General characteristics The State of Tocantins (SoT) is the most recent State in Brazil
created under the 1988 constitution when it split from the northern half of the former
State of Goiás. Located in the Center-North of Brazil, in the Cerrado1 biome (87% of the
state), it has a tropical climate with pronounced seasonality marked by a dry season from
May through October. With an area of 277,621 km2 and a population of 1.38 million
(2010), the state density is low (4.98 hab/km2).

Tocantins’ socioeconomic context at appraisal Despite a dynamic economy characterized
by high growth rates, its GDP per capita was below the national average. As a result,
while the situation had been progressively improving since the State‟s creation, the SoT
was still among the poorest states in Brazil in terms of number of poor relative to total
population in 2000. The State‟s 2000 Municipal Human Development Index (IDH-M)
was estimated at 0.72, below Brazil‟s average (0.76). Poverty was worse in rural areas,
with 68% of the rural population living under the poverty line. Finally, the SoT social
context was marked by the presence of two vulnerable segments of the rural poor,
indigenous people and the Quilombolas2.

SoT and Bank partnership The Project followed a successfully-concluded operation,
initiated at an early stage of the State‟s creation. This first operation had mainly focused
on constructing the State‟s main road networks in accompaniment to the recent creation
of the State. The maturation of the partnership towards a deeper engagement with a State,
characterized by more complex needs, led towards a more encompassing and complex
operation focusing on regional sustainable development.

Bank strategy at appraisal The Project was approved by the Board in late 2003, a period
which coincided with the transition from the 2000-2003 to 2004-2007 Country
Assistance Strategies for Brazil. The Project rationale was aligned to the new strategy: it
was adopting an integrated approach, focusing simultaneously on economic and social
fronts through a regional development operation while fostering environmental protection
and sustainability as well as generation of employment opportunities for the poor.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The project development objective was to contribute to raising living standards and to
reducing inequalities and regional disparities by improving access to markets, job
opportunities, infrastructure and social services for rural communities in Tocantins'

  The Cerrado biome is characterized by savanna formations crossed by gallery forests and stream valleys.
It is one of the most biodiverse savannas in the world, including a mosaic of ecosystems with 23 types of
vegetation consisting mostly of tropical savannas woodland, grasslands and forests.

poorest regions, while ensuring sustainable use of natural resources and the protection of
fragile ecosystems.

The key performance indicators, as indicated in the PAD main text, consisted of a
selection from the rich evaluation framework (see details in Chapter 3 and Annex 2 of the
ICR)– the PAD‟s outcome and output indicators:
     Increase in social capital formation;
     Number of visits to health facilities and school attendance;
     Share of cash crops in total agricultural production;
     Price and transport cost of selected commodities and inputs;
     Travel time to municipal and regional centers;
     Numbers of Municipal Development Fora established and operational,
     Numbers of satisfactory regional and municipal development plans or agenda
        prepared;
     Total area of established state environmental conservation units;

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

No revision of the PDO or the key indicators took place.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The Project‟s target population was comprised of the rural communities (about 300,000
people) established in the four poorest regions on the Eastern end of the SoT: Bico de
Papagaio, Jalapao, Sudeste and Nordeste. These four regions, which together make up
half of the State‟s area, were characterized by scarce and remote settlements. Half of the
municipalities of those regions were, at the time of appraisal, among the lowest-IDH
municipalities in the State.

The Project targeted these remote and poor populations, seeking to improve their
accessibility to markets, job opportunities and social services, by interventions on the
municipal road network to enable year round transit. Additionally, the Project was also
expected to foster empowerment of those populations in the local development agenda
through the adoption of participatory mechanisms to define municipal priorities for
development and investments.

In a broader perspective, the entire population of the State was expected to benefit
indirectly from the Project, which was designed to foster regional development in an
environmentally sustainable manner, as well as to strengthen State administration
management and planning capacity, in complement to the Project‟s local development
activities.


1.5 Original Components
The project was structured along the following three components:


                                            2
1. A participatory planning and management of regional and municipal development
component (US$6.5 million), to: (a) establish and strengthen mechanisms for local civil
society participation; (b) set-up, in each region of the project, regional units of the
Planning Secretariat (SEPLAN) to support the local and regional planning and
management capacity; and (c) strengthen the state's capacity to undertake multi-sectoral
state-level planning, administer public programs and monitor/evaluate the performance of
such programs.
2. An environmental management component (US$10.2 million), to: (a) strengthen the
state's land management capacity; (b) consolidate the state's environmental protection
system; and (c) support the regulation and promotion of sustainable land use.
3. A rural transport improvement component (US$42.7 million), to: (a) strengthen the
state's road management capacity; (b) define in a participatory fashion and improve, to
all-weather condition, about 6,000 km of priority road sections of the main municipal
road networks and improve about 120 km of high-priority state feeder roads; (c) promote
cost-effective rural transport services; and (d) provide support to the project coordination
unit.

The first and third components were expected to contribute directly to the PDO. Indeed,
under the first component, activities fostering participation – with the ultimate goals of
empowering the local population and building social capital together with activities
strengthening the State administration capacity towards development at the State-wide
level – were expected to contribute to raising living standards of rural communities in
Tocantins‟ poorest areas. The third component, for which prioritization was decided in a
participatory fashion, was expected to act as a catalyst for the development of the target
population, by making municipal accesses all-weather/all-year round passable, thus
improving accessibility to markets, job opportunities and social services.

The combination of two successive participatory processes – to define the local
development agenda and to prioritize investments on the municipal roads – was designed
as a two-step empowerment mechanism. First, the population would be involved in
defining the general municipal management organization and development agenda. This
was expected to help make those populations active players in the definition of their
development priorities. Second, the same population would translate particular aspects of
the abovementioned agenda into very concrete and immediate actions (road
improvements), which in turn would contribute to the local development agenda.
Moreover, it was expected to bring transparency in the allocation of resources within
each municipality, as investments were envisaged to be coherent with the recently
adopted development agenda.

The second component was also expected to contribute to the PDO by creating a
sustainable framework for the State‟s regional development through land use
management and biodiversity protection that would foster a regionally balanced and
socially and environmentally sustainable development of the State.

No revision of project components took place.

1.7 Other significant changes

The Project underwent two restructurings. The first restructuring was approved on
August 13, 2009, extending the closing date by one year, until December 31, 2010 and
including a new beneficiary, the Finance Secretariat-(SEFAZ), with no change to the
PDO nor to the Project description. The second restructuring was approved on December
16, 2010, extending the closing date an additional 10 months, until October 31, 2011.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of background analysis. Background analysis informing Project preparation is
considered to have been appropriate and critical to effective Project design. Bank
presence within the State, nearly since its creation, had enabled it to acquire thorough
knowledge of sector needs and to establish a long-term partnership with the SoT. In the
initial phases of the State‟s creation, Bank collaboration focused on construction of trunk
infrastructure through the Second State Highway Management Project (1994-1999), in
line with the significant needs of a newly created State. However, as the State‟s capacity
strengthened and its development agenda became more comprehensive, the Bank‟s
approach evolved and in the Project subject to the present ICR, aimed at focusing on
infrastructure investments as a catalyst for economic growth and local development to
reduce regional disparities and contribute to the alleviation of poverty. This close
familiarity with the State‟s development agenda and the extended partnership with the
Bank explain the comprehensive nature of Project design, which was customized to
accommodate the SoT‟s evolving and more complex needs. Finally, specific studies and
evaluations undertaken during Project preparation, including cost benefit analysis and
evaluations of institutional and fiduciary capacity at the state level, among others, also
provided further analytical basis for Project design.

Assessment of Project design. The Project design was based on a solid assessment of the
issues at hand and provided a sound response to the development challenges of the State.
In addition, the Project was structured through a comprehensive approach that departed
from the traditional model of transport operations. The latter was characterized by a
strong predominance of road investments, both in terms of project activities and
allocation of funds, and technical assistance and institutional strengthening components
often represented limited activities. As a precursor to multi-sector operations, the Project
design was innovative with a more balanced approach, dedicating only half of Project
funds to road investments while making the institutional strengthening and policy support
component a central piece of Project design and fostering its effective execution through
a strong allocation of Loan proceeds to these activities (the cost sharing arrangement
provided for 84% Bank financing for institutional strengthening activities, against 50 to
60% for the work components).



                                             4
Institutional strengthening activities and investments were designed in an articulated
fashion to serve the Project‟s goal for sustainable regional development and created a
well-rounded program: empowered populations and strengthened local economic
development, strengthen environment policy and management capacity, improved access
for competitiveness and social development. The implementation tools were
comprehensive and customized to the Project needs, as illustrated by the ample use of
participatory decision. Innovative and efficient approach to the issue of local accessibility
was designed with a focus on the elimination of critical spots through the building of
bridges and culverts, a well customized solution to the situation of the State, where floods
often represent a challenge for transport during the rainy season. This low cost and low
maintenance solutions allowed improving close to 6,000 km or roads with limited
resources. Moreover, the method of implementation of these works by combining
standardized technology in the production of bridge decks, with a labor intensive
approach to execute the bridges‟ supports and the culverts, further increased efficiency of
the program while generating temporal employment opportunities at the local level
further benefiting the local economic tissue.

In terms of implementation, the variety of activities included under the Project implied
that multiple institutions and stakeholders were directly or indirectly involved in Project
implementation: several State Secretariats and agencies (e.g. environment agency
Naturatins), State administrations de-concentrated in the regions, 67 municipalities,
diverse communities, etc. However, the Project was designed to ensure an important level
of centralization in the implementation process, with one Project Implementation Unit in
charge of all fiduciary processes which simplified implementation and increased the
quality of execution (in the case of the works in the municipalities). As a result, the
institutional set-up was responsive to Project needs and effective in ensuring that
resources were adequately allocated and used.

With hindsight, it appears that implementation challenges increased as a result of the
wide scope of the Project‟s design, particularly given the overall limited amount allocated
to the Project (US$100 million, out of which US$60 million from the Bank loan), and the
large contribution expected of the State (40%) in a context of limited available resources
at the State level (financial, human resources, capacity etc.). The large number of
activities - over 200 – could have resulted in a piecemeal approach that could have put at
risk the ability to result in substantial impact. From both the Client and the Bank‟s
perspectives, the multi sector design had made Project management an energy-intensive
task, involving various sectors, a situation further compounded by the procurement
packaging, which involved often one procurement process (systematically prior
reviewed) per activity.

Finally, the Project M&E included a comprehensive Results Framework, and a
customized Impact Evaluation (IE). The Results Framework, while following particular
usual practices at that time on many aspects (structure, nature of output indicators etc.),
was also innovative and complex to reflect the muti-sector nature of the Project. As a
result, it displayed some shortcomings, such as: (i) indicators and impact evaluation not
defined in full harmony, (ii) lack of availability of data to monitor some indicators, (iii)
too ambitious scope of some indicators‟ objective. The IE was based on a pilot

                                             5
experiences in other contemporary operations. It was a particular effort to improve
Project M&E and a rare and innovative tool for transport operations. The preliminary
assessment of the IE by the ICR team revealed a pertinent tool to objectively assess the
Project outcome through the use of relevant proxies. Beyond, this preliminary assessment
is expected to be completed by a more thorough Bank research paper to further exploit
the results of this IE3, which is seen as an opportunity to contribute to enhance Bank
understanding of rural transport projects‟ transformational impacts. Details on the Results
Framework are further elaborated in Section 3.2.

Government commitment. Government commitment varied during project preparation
and implementation, mostly as a function of changing political cycles. Notwithstanding
such variations, commitment shown by technical teams within the Government was
sustained throughout implementation and proved critical to its effective execution,
particularly considering the complexity and energy-intensive nature of the Project
supervision. The importance of ensuring political commitment for such a Project could
not be understated, especially given the heightened need for coordination and consensus
building in this type of multi-sector type operation.

Assessment of risks. During preparation, a series of risks were identified as reflected in
the risk matrix of the PAD. Risk assessment was overall well grounded at the time of
appraisal. Major foreseen risks, related to fluctuating Government commitment, lack of
coordination among different players and lack of availability of counterpart funds,
effectively materialized during Project implementation. Likewise, the mitigation
measures were appropriately assessed and proved effective when the risks materialized.
In addition, some unforeseen risks also materialized, including the financial crisis and the
impeachment of the State‟s Governor in 2009, both having had strong repercussions on
overall Project implementation.

Finally, the social, environmental, and fiduciary aspects of the Project have been
adequately addressed overall. In particular, detailed analysis was conducted for potential
environmental and social impacts during Project preparation. Environmental guidelines
were in place and adequately implemented. No resettlement took place. With hindsight,
the Project could have improved its a priori assessment on the feasibility of particular
activities within the timeframe of a Bank operation (e.g. creation of conservation areas)
since such activities involve a lengthy process of mobilizing broad social commitment
and may also entail some land acquisition.

2.2. Implementation

Initial Delays. The implementation of this Project was challenging in many ways, but
ultimately successful. The first stages of Project implementation were characterized by
important delays, part of which were the result of administrative delays (the PDRS,
approved on December 9, 2003, only became effective one year later, on December 20,


3
  The DEC/LAC-SD funded study is expected to further assess the IE results to better identify impact on
local development of rural transport projects.

                                                    6
2004). Initial preparatory activities were slow to start, mostly as the result of a slow take-
over of the newly elected Government. While the Project first activities effectively
started with Project effectiveness, this did not translate immediately with a take-off of the
disbursement as a result of: (i) the nature of the Project implied lengthy preparatory
activities, including various consultations processes widespread over a large territory
with poor accesses, which were time consuming; (ii) the geographic dispersion of works
throughout the State resulted in a long process to prepare works designs (67 participative
consultations on prioritizing road investments in a State the size of England with low
accessibility, often without paved road access, then preparation of project designs of 4000
critical spots including 700 bridges in very remote areas with overall 67 tendering
documents for works); (iii) the nature of the works, which implied multiple small
contracts (67 contracts averaging only US$0.65 million each) and increased the burden in
terms of procurement processes (consulting, non-consulting, goods contracts and some
additional works contracts had amounted to a staggering 220 processes overall); and (iv)
the nature and timing of the political cycle, vis-a-vis the Project cycle (the change in
Governor from preparation to implementation) and the time needed for the new
Government to fully integrate the potential benefits of the Project activities.

Take off, with some fluctuation in implementation. In 2007, the Project saw a
remarkable pick-up in its disbursement rate. From December 2007 to December 2008 one
third of the total amount of the Loan was disbursed. Since its take-off, overall Project
implementation was characterized by some degree of fluctuation due to foreseen events,
such as the interruption of works during the rainy season which spans over 6 months per
year and difficulty to manage multiple contracts at a time, as well as some unexpected
circumstances, such as shortfalls in the allocation of counterpart leading to delays in the
payment of contracts. Two additional and unforeseen factors contributed to severely
impact Project execution and resulted in a deceleration of implementation in 2009: (i)
financial constraints imposed on the State budget as a result of the international financial
crisis, and (ii) the general slowdown in the State‟s public administration following the
impeachment of the Governor in June 2009. The new Government was elected in
September 2009 for a short 15-months period (electoral cycle imposed new elections in
October 2010), further compounding the difficulty to obtain a strong commitment to the
Project‟s objective as a result of the short term mandate of the new government. Overall,
this process of political transition and cycle added to the difficulty of mobilizing
counterpart funds and delayed Project implementation. Fortunately, the new Government
elected in 2010 strongly embraced the Project and its rapid and deep commitment
towards the Project objectives allowed the completion of Project activities and more
successful outcomes.

Project restructuring. Initial delays and fluctuations in Project implementation explain
the need for two extensions to the Project‟s closing date, which ultimately allowed the
Project to fully disburse and meet its development objectives. The first extension was
granted in august 2009, extending the closing date by one year, until December 31, 2010.
This restructuring also included minor adjustments to the loan amount distribution, with
the objective of optimizing resource allocation in relation to needs, making use of the
unallocated category which constituted 11.5% of the loan amount. The second extension
was granted on December 16, 2010, extending the closing date by an additional 10

                                              7
months, until October 31, 2011. This second extension allowed the Project to take
advantage of the dry period, enabling to substantially advance with physical works.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Monitoring design

The design of a monitoring system to assess the PDO achievement is based on two
distinct tools: (i) the Results Framework, established in the PAD; and (ii) a
complementary ex-post Impact Evaluation undertaken by the Client.

Results Framework. The Project‟s Results Framework was an attempt to reflect the
Project complexity. It was also designed at a stage when the Bank had not yet defined a
standardized approach towards monitoring and evaluation. However, its implementation
and utilization have posed several challenges. First, the attempt to reflect the Project‟s
comprehensiveness resulted in the design of a complex three levels monitoring tool
aimed at measuring Project overall impact (the said “sector indicators?, see below),
outcome and outputs. Second, with hindsight, the choice of specific indicators may not
have always been the most appropriate: some indicators were lacking an appropriate
definition and were hard to measure, others did not have a defined baseline, others were
hardly measurable, some did not have obvious causality with the outcome or output they
were expected to measure, or were too ambitious.

In particular, the Project had an original first category of indicators, denominated “Sector
Indicators,? classified under the category “CAS-related goals?. These indicators
presented some shortcomings such as lack of appropriate definition, no baseline or target
values, inaccurate articulation with project timeline (e.g. the indicators measured on a 10-
year frequency in Brazil), and limited or inexistent causality between the Project and the
indicator. In practice, the pertinence of the inclusion of such indicators in the result
framework remains unclear as these indicators could hardly be measured and were not
Project related. The main shortcoming of the “Outcome indicators? was, with the
hindsight, the miss opportunity of a better definition to more fully take advantage of the
Project Impact Evaluation. Finally, while “Output indicators? represented pragmatic and
easily measurable indicators, during monitoring several indicators did not appropriately
capture the Project‟s expected benefits, and in several cases, the indicators‟ targets were
overly optimistic.

To overcome those difficulties when assessing the Project results at ICR preparation, the
project team proposed suitable quantifiable proxies from the Project Impact Evaluation
(see below). In cases where the indicator was not met, progress towards achieving the
indicator was described. A detailed assessment of achievement of each indicator and
evaluation of the respective pertinence of the indicator is provided in annex 2.

Impact Evaluation (IE). The Project benefited from an impact evaluation based on the
previous experience of rural development projects (ie. the Rural Alleviation Projects of
the Northeast of Brazil and the Impact Evaluation of the Vietnam Transport Project). The


                                             8
IE was envisioned as an exercise to better establish causal links between the Project‟s
interventions and outcomes/outputs.

The IE has been carried out through two separate surveys, administered to reflect the
before and after treatment situations, and targeted at both household and local community
levels. The first survey was carried out prior to the start of works (2003 and 2005) to
establish the baseline. These surveys had been conducted with 1492 households in
beneficiary municipalities and with 14 community associations in all the four Project
regions. The „after-treatment‟ survey was carried out at Project closure in July 2011,
establishing the final assessment for two of the four regions works had been concluded at
that time, representing 1005 households and 11 communities4. Based on abovementioned
previous experiences, the surveys were structured along 10 main topics (general
characteristics, education, health, employment, resources and availability, domestic
production activities, credit, community activities, transport, living standards). The after
treatment survey was further complemented with qualitative questions on perceptions of
the Project‟s impact among beneficiaries.

Monitoring implementation

The Borrower was responsible for the implementation of the M&E subcomponent and the
Impact Evaluation, with satisfactory results. The tasks were concentrated in the hands of
a number of specialists contracted by the Project. With hindsight, more could have been
done to institutionalize monitoring and evaluation practices within the State and
strengthen their capacity.

Monitoring utilization

The M&E framework was intended to provide a feedback loop to improve Project
operations. A midterm review was planned to evaluate the efficiency of the Project in
reaching its objectives with the plan to modify, if deemed necessary, the design of certain
Project components and/or mechanisms in place. The Project midterm review did not end
up revising the indicators which were not measurable at that time partly because delays in
starting Project implementation meant only few activities had been undertaken at that
point. The undertaking of the Project‟s Impact Evaluation by the State of Tocantins is
considered an important accomplishment. In particular, the evaluation is expected to
provide valuable information to inform the preparation of new operations within the State
and Brazil. It is also expected to benefit the Bank as part of its knowledge creation and
dissemination agenda as few impact evaluations are on-the-shelf available for transport
projects.



4
 The after treatment evaluation was limited to two regions as works only begun in the two other regions
only some months before Project closure and it was assessed that an evaluation at that point in time would
not have provided sufficient time for households to acquire benefits of works. It is worth noting that the IE
should be complemented by new surveys on the remaining regions in July 2012. Final and complementary
evaluation of the IE is expected to be provided after the completion of the ICR. Likewise, the detailed
analysis of the IE by both the Borrower and the Bank was underway at completion of the ICR.

                                                     9
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Assessment and Natural Habitats: The Project was rated as a Category „A‟.

Environmental safeguards were handled in a satisfactory manner by the Client. The
monitoring and evaluation of environmental impacts were carried out by the Road
Agency (DERTINS)‟s environmental team in collaboration with Environmental Agency
(NATURATINS). Monitoring of environmental impacts by DERTINS was thorough and
ensured good quality and overall environmental compliance with Bank safeguard
requirements.

Environmental externalities from civil works consisted mostly in small and localized
impacts on vegetation, soil and water course and temporary associated inconveniences
during the works phase of culverts and bridges construction. While the Project works stop
and go‟s during implementation may have prolonged the timeframe of the expected
environmental impacts in cases, such impacts have remained limited in time and
geographic spread.

By improving the conditions of transport and fostering local development, notably in
agriculture, the Project may have triggered changes in the patterns of agricultural
production in the immediate vicinity of rural roads. Such changes may, in turn, have had
cumulative impacts on natural habitats and land use which might prolong in the future.
However, while the degree of this impact is hard to assess at this point, it can be noted
that (i) areas involved in changes in agriculture patterns have generally remained limited
(3 to 5 km from the improved road), and (ii) the Project had environment protection as an
integral part of Project design to enhance sustainability, through a specific project
component dedicated to optimize land use management (in a sustainable fashion) and
strengthen the State‟s environmental protection system (see more detailed assessment in
section 3.2).

In terms of the Project‟s handling of social safeguards, an evaluation was undertaken in
2010, concluding that: (i) participatory selection processes for prioritization of works
have been an important achievement for the State in terms of fostering social inclusion;
(ii) no involuntary resettlement or land acquisition were required throughout the Project;
and (iii) no indigenous people were affected by the Project‟s investments.

Fiduciary compliance was also satisfactory, despite the extended number of contracts
(over 200) handled under the Project and the multiple challenges encountered in terms of
procurement throughout implementation. As mentioned above, this was a time-
consuming and human resources-intensive exercise both for the Client and Bank
supervision team (all processes were reviewed a priori). With hindsight, the aggregation
of procurement processes in a fewer number of packages, when feasible and pertinent,
could have been implemented. This option was however rejected by the Client during
Project execution as it had adapted its structure and capacity and felt that this method had
proved to provide good results. From a Financial Management perspective, the change in
physical localization of the Implementing agency in the last 10 months of Project


                                            10
implementation, following the new Government election, resulted in a temporary partial
disorganization of the Project archives which was resolved by the Project end.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The sustainability of actions undertaken under this operation is supported by the
principles underlying Project design, which has been entrenched in the Borrower‟s
operational processes, even beyond the scope of the Project (see section 4 for a review of
project sustainability) and the Project successful implementation: a decentralized, bottom
up approach to investment and development planning in support to local development.

From a political economy perspective, the Project has supported activities aimed at
improving accessibility of low income populations in lagging regions whose increase in
living standards, in turn, is expected to contribute to the State welfare. The Project
strengthened local development efforts, including through populations‟ empowerment
mechanisms to establish municipal development agendas and their subsequent road
investment prioritization. From a social and civil perspective, it also contributed to
durably improve access to social service for the target rural populations. Finally, the
Project supported the creation of decentralized technical units in the regions with the
specific objective to further empower populations, identify opportunities of development
and strengthen local production capacity. Those units are in operation.

From an infrastructure management perspective, the selected nature of works on
municipal roads, consisting in low maintenance infrastructures, provided for sustainable
improved accessibility of rural populations. Although pilot CREMA were not
implemented, this contract modality was adopted by the road administration by Project
end, with endorsement by three successive governors and will now be widely applied to
the state main road network. The regional technical units of the road administrations,
which have traditionally undertaken municipal road maintenance, have been strengthened.
Sustainable improved road management practices is also evidenced through the road
agency‟s recognition of the prime importance of road maintenance (against a focus on
construction in the past), and the development of support tools such as: the set up of a
road management system, road condition evaluations (undertaken by the agency) and
traffic evaluations (including the implementation of automatic traffic counters), and
various training in road management.

As an expression of commitment to these principles, the Government of Tocantins has
requested a follow-on operation which builds upon the accomplishments of PDRS. The
proposed Tocantins Integrated Sustainable Regional Development Project (PDRIS) is a
US$375 million operation (including a US$300 million Bank loan) and will tentatively
include two broad components: (i) physical works component including improvements to
transport conditions in the State, under an integrated approach, targeting both capillary
municipal roads for improved accessibility (like under the present operation) and State
feeder roads (with a strengthened support to road maintenance), articulating interventions
with trunk national transport networks; and (ii) an institutional strengthening component
seeking to improve the quality of public services, including the modernization of State
administration (SEPLAM), improvements in local and regional production systems

                                           11
(SEAGRO) and improvements in environmental management (SEMADS) in
prolongation to the present operation, as well as increased quality of the State‟s education
system (SEDUC). Building on lessons learnt from the Project, the execution of this new
larger operation has been carefully planned with strengthened implementing unit, more
operational constraints for particular disbursements (e.g. investments in municipalities
conditioned to the participation to an intermunicipal consortium) and a longer timeframe
(6 years). For example, particular attention was given to the procurement plan, combining
activities as possible to limit the number of processes. Likewise, counterpart‟s financing
will focus on activities less subject to changes in polical commitment, such as paving
works, while rehabilitation works, fully undertaken with CREMA, will be 100% financed
by the Bank and more flexibility in the implementation of the institutional financing
activities will be granted.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Substantial relevance.

Relevance of the Project objectives is rated high. The Project objectives remain
consistent with current State and country priorities, as well as Bank assistance strategies:
   - Project objectives remain very relevant in the context of the strategic pillars in the
        previous CPS (2008-2011) and in the present CPS (2012-2015). Under the
        previous CPS, the Project targeted increased efforts towards an equitable,
        sustainable and competitive Brazil, with a focus on populations at the bottom of
        the pyramid, providing access to basic services and investing in frontier regions
        with high concentrations of poverty. Likewise, the Project remains particularly
        relevant in the context of the new 2012-2015 CPS which is structured around four
        strategic objectives: (1) Increase the volume and productivity of public and
        private investments; (2) Improve quality and expand provision of public services
        for low income households; (3) Promote regional economic development through
        strategic investments and policies; and (4) Improve sustainable natural resource
        management and climate resilience. The project development objective and
        activities address the second and fourth CPS objectives - which will remain vital
        to promote Brazil‟s continued social and economic development by means of
        enhancing equity and expanding opportunities but also by emphasizing
        environmental sustainability. The Project also touches upon the other two
        strategic objectives, preparing the way for further capacity-building and
        investments;
   - Project objectives also remain relevant considering the strategic direction being
        adopted by the State of Tocantins as reflected in the State‟s Pluri-Annual Plan
        (PPA) for 2012-2015. While the first PPAs were focused on building core
        infrastructure given the relative remoteness of the State and the existence of
        lagging regions, more recent PPAs have progressively evolved towards
        supporting a more encompassing, well balanced and integrated development
        vision. The three pillars for current PPA are based on the increase of Tocantins‟
        contribution to the national GDP through regional deconcentration, the promotion

                                            12
       of social inclusion by reducing poverty and inequality and the guarantee of
       environmental sustainability. All three strategic pillars are central to the PDRS‟s
       objectives.

The new Bank operation in Tocantins (PDRIS) is also a testament to the continued
relevance of the Project‟s objectives, design and implementation, given that in several
aspects the new operation builds on the achievements and lessons learnt under the closing
Project. Both projects are well-articulated, with the new operation acting as an
opportunity to go a step beyond in the sustained accompaniment of the Bank to
Tocantins‟s sustainable development, while still tackling several of the same challenges.
Despite modifications in the scope and outreach of the new Project, the fact that many of
the underlying principles remain unchanged indicates that the PDRS, as designed and
implemented, has remained particularly relevant over the years and that many of its
priorities remain relevant.

The Project design is assessed as overall moderately relevant. On one side, the richness
and diversity of complementary Project components largely contributed to the Project
success and in fact, the Project prefigured other multi sector projects that have since then
been developed in Brazil. A number of tools prepared at design were also very relevant,
such as the Impact Evaluation (which followed cutting edge experience in the Bank at
that time) embedded in the Project, a practice still highly relevant as of today.
Centralizing Project implementation in a Project Management Unit was also a good
solution to appropriately undertake the Project numerous activities. On the other hand,
the degree of complexity of the Project design might have had an impact on
implementation delays and dispersing the Borrower‟s efforts – for a newly created State
still consolidating its capacity – among a large number of components could have had a
negative impact on Project outcome (a situation which eventually did not occur and the
Project was successful). Finally, as previously mentioned, the design of the Result
Framework, while being a laudable attempt to reflect the Project comprehensiveness,
revealed some shortcomings.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The achievement of Project Development Objectives is rated moderately satisfactory. On
the one had, the Project has undoubtedly positively contributed to raising living standards
and to reducing inequalities and regional disparities by improving access to markets, job
opportunities, infrastructure and social services for rural communities in Tocantins'
poorest regions, while ensuring sustainable use of natural resources and the protection of
fragile ecosystems. On the other hand, despite the significant achievements on the
ground, some of which exceeded initial targets and expectations, not all targets of the
initially formulated results indicators were fully achieved, which in reality is a reflection
of a complex results framework that was not fully adapted to the needs of the project.

More specifically, the Project has been successful in: (i) adopting an integrated approach
in which transport serves as a platform for transformation of the communities‟ local

                                             13
development; (ii) adopting a bottom-up approach to foster rural communities
empowerment in local development through participatory planning; (iii) promoting better
social inclusion and enhanced appropriation of economic opportunities through
accompanying measures to local development initiatives; (iii) fostering the state
management capacity in environment to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources
and the protection of fragile ecosystems (see details below); (iv) promoting a strong
ownership of the Project by final beneficiaries and State counterparts, beyond political
agendas, leading to perspectives of continued engagement beyond the actual Project.

The achievement of the PDO is demonstrated by the assessment from the Project M&E
where: most project outcome targets as defined by the result framework were achieved,
and when they are not, this was mostly due to shortcomings in the definition of the
indicator (see detailed analysis in Annex 2) though significant progress was achieved on
those targets, and initial results from the IE confirmed the achievement of the project
development objectives (as the Results Framework did not include specific PDO
indicators). The IE and community based surveys are also detailed in Annex 2.

The 1st component, participatory planning and management of regional and municipal
development, was by and large successfully achieved (6 out of 7 indicators achieved).
Although this component had the smallest allocation (US$6.5 million), it funded a large
number of activities such as municipal development agendas, CONDERs, regional
development agendas, UTRs, increased number of municipalities presenting annual
statements in conformity with standards, and strengthened planning system, all
participating to the component‟s objective.

Empowering rural poor populations through participatory mechanisms is a significant
outcome of this project, highlighting mechanisms to incentivize peoples‟ deliberation on
their municipal development agendas and for them to prioritize investments on municipal
roads. It is a tool that provides legitimacy to investment decisions, and ensures
sustainability of planning programs. It is also a means to strengthen rural poor in their
citizenship belonging, including rights and responsibilities. This exercise determined
works that improved accessibility to employment opportunities, schools, and services
(including social services) for some of the poorest in Tocantins. The Project also
supported specific pilot activities to support inclusiveness by fostering support to
particular fragile and remote populations such as Quilombolas, fostering the development
of new activities such as ecotourism in remote municipalities with potential, etc (see
Section 6 Lessons Learned for further information).

The 2nd component, environmental management, was overall substantially achieved (1
indicator achieved, 2 partially achieved), as it supported numerous activities and achieved
results in the different areas covered by the component, as well as supported activities in
areas beyond the scope defined in the project description:
    a) in land management capacity, the Client had carried out 4 zonings, including 3
        thematic and 1 geographic, which establish measures for sustainable
        development, including economic development activities in respect of
        environment and natural resources protection, as well as biodiversity
        conservation. In support of the above zoning, the Project also contributed to

                                            14
       strengthen the State‟s land management capacity through various studies, capacity
       training, equipment including cars, hydrometeorological stations, and a light plane
       extending monitoring to inaccessible areas. Further work on territorial
       management policies is expected in the proposed follow-on operation utilizing the
       above zoning studies with a integrated territorial development and management
       perspective (TOR already prepared);
    b) in environment protection, the Project supported the development of the State
       policy on biodiversity. In fact, in coordination with the GEF Cerrado Project to
       provide more weight to the conservation activities, the Project strengthened the
       State policy of environmental protection planning and supervision capacity
       through numerous studies on the State fauna and flora, program of biodiversity
       conservation, preparatory work for legislation for the protection of fauna and
       formulation of a State policy on fishing, thus, preparatory work for three times
       (18) the number of protected areas as envisaged in the Project 5. The Project also
       supported the structuring of the State policy on water resources management
       through financing the State Water Master Plan, a Hydro-geological Water
       Resources Master Plan and river water flow studies, and then operationalized
       recommendations through five river basin action plans and through creation of
       basin management committees;
    c) the Project supported the aquisition of satellite images and maps as well as
       instruments within 2 masterplan studies (land use and coverage changes, and
       forest inventory) for territorial planning and management. The studies a)
       identified environmental & socioeconomic factors that cause land usage changes,
       b) helped define strategic agribusiness, industrialization investments and clean
       development policies regarding carbon footprint, and (c) laid the ground for an
       integrated territorial management and sustainable development.

The overall impacts of these support activities, on biodiversity, water resource
management, and territorial management are: a) helped the State recognize the
environment not only for its intrinsic values but also as an asset that supports quality of
life for citizens and offers economic opportunities, such as the development of
ecotourism, b) granted tools that assure the sustainability of good management practices
of the environment, and c) supported integration of environmental concerns into transport
operations and factor in direct and cumulative impacts of growth, given the nature of a
multi-sector operation (this Project‟s integration of environmental concerns into transport
operations is considered a best practice referenced in Bank Report 44163 “Mainstreaming
Conservation in Infrastructure Projects, Cases Study from Latin America? Juan D
Quintero).

The 3rd project component, rural transport improvement, was by and large successfully
achieved (4 of 5 indicators achieved). Both in terms of physical outputs and capacity
building, this component exceeded its objectives to eliminate critical spots on the
municipal road networks (95% against 85%), increase traffic on improved roads (x2 in 5

 Timing for effective creation of protected areas in Brazil is in fact not compatible with the timing of a
Project, often close to several decades.

                                                     15
years), improve roads (144 km against 120 km) and traffic conditions, and strengthen
transport planning capacity. Despite being a compelling modality, output-based
rehabilitation and maintenance contracts were not implemented, but introduction of this
modality is a long term effort and requires continuous political commitment. It finally
gained momentum in Tocantins as a result of extensive dialogue on its merits in terms of
efficiency and transparency. These long term efforts have been paying off as illustrated
by the endorsement of this contractual modality as the management tool for the main road
network.

3.3 Efficiency

An ex-post economic analysis was conducted following appraisal methodology. It is
focused on the investment component6, including construction of bridges and culverts on
non-paved municipal roads and follows a producer surplus assessment approach.

In order to assess variations in the estimated economic returns over the 9-year preparation
and implementation cycle, the ex-post evaluation computed benefit and cost based on: (i)
pre- and post-Project historical agricultural productions, (ii) updated production forecasts,
(iii) updated unit values of benefit and cost parameters, and (iv) final Project
implementation costs. The resulting Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and Net
Present Value (NPV) are shown in the below table (full details are presented in Annex 3).

                Appraisal              18.5%                   R$ 42.1

Overall, the ex-post economic evaluation shows satisfactory results. The ICR-stage EIRR
is estimated as 20.2%, which is higher than the appraisal estimate. Though the NPV
decreased from R$42.1 million to R$27.5 million, it is concluded that investments made
under the component remain economically justified. One of the major factors leading to
this change was the delay in Project implementation. At appraisal, the construction works
were expected to be completed in 4 years, having actually taken 7 years to conclude. The
longer-than-expected construction period delayed the generation of producer surplus and
as a result, the total surplus was reduced. However, this did not affect the EIRR
substantially because the delay also led to lower costs in terms of present value.

Another major update was robust growth in the total value of agriculture productions.
Both the area of production and productivity (tonnage per hectare) as well as the unit
value of production significantly increased during the past 9 years. For example, the
value of soy-bean production had grown 5 times from 2001 to 2009, even after excluding
inflation contribution. Finally, the appreciation of the exchange rate, vis a vis the dollar
resulted in a slight reduction in the number of kilometers intervened under the Project
(from 5,670km to 5,121km), reducing the overall area of influence of the Project by

 while the Project institutional strengthening was very efficient, these investments finally accounted for 71
percent of the total expenditures under the Project

                                                     16
approximately 10%. However, the strong growth in terms of production considerably
offsets this downside effect.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating of moderately satisfactory is based on the following:
 Achievement of project development objectives substantiated by solid results for
   most Key Performance Indicators and outputs and positive assessment from the IE;
 achieving important advances in terms of state-wide environmental policy, as well as
   environment management and capacity;
 economic and financial efficiency;
 Survey-based evidence of physical quality of investments, and improved living
   standards especially as a result of increased accessibility;
 project benefits from physical infrastructure targeting large populations of poorest
   rural communities;
 innovative tools partially implemented and others still under consideration impacting
   positively sustainability of project results.
 Continued and substantial relevance of project design largely adopted in new
   operation.
 Continued relevance of project outputs of physical investments, goods, studies and
   training
 Project investments exceeding by close to 15% Project initial value, fully funded by
   the counterpart, due to the number of activities financed and Project success.

This rating takes into account the non achievement of some outputs (these were later
replaced by other activities to achieve outcomes), and the initial delay in implementation
as a result of slow administrative processing and the extensive preparatory activities
needed before works, including large consultations processes, and which ultimately
resulted in a closing date extension of 22 months to achieve the project outcomesSuch
minor shortcomings aside, the Project has resulted in important outcomes in terms of
improving the rural population‟s access to markets, job opportunities, infrastructure and
social services, as well as in terms of creating an important foundation in terms of
environmental sustainability.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

In addition to the impacts already covered in previous paragraphs, this part reviews
additional efforts to assess the Project and build lessons for future operations.

Job creation: A survey has been carried out by the Road Agency (DERTINS) on 27
private firms contracted for civil works. These surveys were intended to bring knowledge
on the employment impacts of the Project‟s civil interventions. This survey estimated that


                                           17
around 2600 official jobs were created, of which 84% were local and regional jobs (55%
beneficiary municipalities and 29% in neighboring municipalities) and 16% were jobs
generated in the firms‟ headquarters. The duration of these job assignments varied
between 4 to 8 months in the field and between 6 to 10 months in headquarters.

An interesting result aggregating the total number of employees per municipality shows
that the four municipalities benefiting most in terms of employment generation were
Palmas, Porto Nacional, Palmeiras do TO and Colméia, where the headquarters of these
companies are located.

Gender: The initial Project design did not envisage gender-specific activities; however
the Project implementation has fostered a gender-sensitive approach during its different
phases, for example, female participation during consultation processes on municipal
development and investment prioritization. Impact Evaluation surveys, carried out in July
2011, included gender-specific questions (quantitative and qualitative) to ensure gender-
insightful findings on project outcomes. Survey results on health and education show gap
in accessibility to services between genders has diminished and increased female
employment following project completion (25% female homemakers pre-project, 12%
post-project).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Risk to development outcome is considered low, with moderate impact.

At State level, the special nature of the Project, which brings together different sectors
and multiple stakeholders, made political commitment and strong decision making key
determinants of Project success. This explains the enhanced impact of political cycles on
Project performance throughout the implementation phase, reflected in ups and downs in
the level of political commitment towards the Project. However, after years of
implementation, overall support for the Project‟s broader concept and its underlying
policies have become entrenched at State level and that State officials now acknowledge
the benefits to decentralization, to the strengthening of municipal administrations and to
the empowerment of local populations, making the risk of policy reversal unlikely.
Looking forward, and considering that the nature of the proposed new operation also
makes it vulnerable to political cycles, Project design included specific mechanisms (such
as long term contracts, customized financing, and realistic implementation timeframes,
among others), in order to mitigate potential impacts arising from political changes and to
ensure sustained ownership at the highest political levels (see also Section 6 Lessons
Learned).

At Municipal level, commitment has also proven to be critical to Project sustainability.
By design, the Project targeted the State level and the local level, working directly with
Project beneficiaries, bypassing the municipal jurisdiction, with no sufficient concrete
actions in terms of capacity building being directed towards the municipal administration.
In practice, it has become apparent that municipal buy-in is also critical to effective
implementation and that the terms of the relationship between the State and participating
municipalities need to be better defined and formalized. With hindsight, while

                                            18
endorsement of the Program by the Municipalities has been total7, the PDRS could have
better designed mechanisms to enforce responsibilities acquired by beneficiary
Municipalities and

At community level, commitment and engagement of beneficiary populations can also
play an important role in attaining and safeguarding the Project‟s development objectives.
In the initial stages of Project implementation, the participatory, bottom-up approach
adopted by the Project was extremely successful in terms of engaging local populations
in planning processes and fostering ownership of the local development agendas among
beneficiary populations. Mechanisms included under Project design to ensure the
sustainability of this social empowerment, such as follow-on regional development
initiatives and other instruments put in place to give continuity to the participatory
approach beyond the planning stage, might in particular cases, have fallen short of their
original objectives, with some notable cases of success. Overall, however, community
and people participation to the State development agenda has been durably strengthened
as illustrated by the preparation of the State new PPA, which was based on ample
regional consultations.

On a technical level, the nature of works being undertaken under the Project is a
guarantee by itself of the sustainability of the investments. By focusing on the elimination
of critical spots, through the construction of concrete hydraulic structures (bridges,
culverts, etc.) to provide year round access to local populations, this technical solution
minimizes the need for maintenance, increasing the durability of investments. Structures
put in place are expected to remain useful for decades, with basically no resources being
needed for maintenance, an important factor considering the general lack of capacity of
the municipalities to undertake such maintenance. Beyond these specific interventions,
maintenance is critical. The Project tried to address this issue through the establishment
of the Intermunicipal Consortiums, but results have been limited, with the legal context
only recently being formulated at Federal level, and distance between municipalities
making maintenance cooperation difficult (see Annex 2). Often, the State road agency
continues providing support to the municipalities in the maintenance of their networks
following a scheme in use for years in the State. Further building on the concept of
intermunicipal consortia (and strengthening such consortia) to further foster
responsibility and empowerment of municipalities remains an appealing solution for
sustainable municipal road maintenance in service to the local development in the SoT.

The environmental and social sustainability of works undertaken under the Project was
also well conceived, not only through the activation and adequate management of
safeguards but also through the inclusion of a sound environmental component, which
intended to preemptively compensate for unintended direct, indirect and cumulative
impacts of improving infrastructure access to previously inaccessible areas and
promoting further growth and economic activity (mainly agriculture) among remote
populations. In view of potential environmental impacts, the Project tried to reinforce the


7
  as illustrated by the immediate signature by all the 72 municipalities served under the new operation of a
cooperation agreements with the State for similar infrastructures

                                                    19
State‟s environmental protection agenda, through the creation of protected areas, the
promotion of land use management, environmental licensing and water management,
among others. Although some of the original approaches to land zoning and creation of
protected areas were adapted throughout Project implementation, the Project has played a
key role in moving forward the debate at State level and in installing cutting edge ideas
on environmental management among public officials and decision makers, who now see
the environment as an “asset? moving forward. Through PDRS and the GEF Sustainable
Cerrado Project, much has been advanced in terms of preparatory work, setting the stage
for effective results under the proposed new operation.


5. Bank and Borrower Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
This rating is based on:
 close collaboration between Bank and Borrower during preparation of a novel multi-
   sector approach;
 adoption of lessons from best practices in designing a local development project
 adoption of balanced approach between sectors (environment, administration and
   transport) and integration of programs and resources by integrating environmental
   component into three subcomponents
 relevance to Borrower‟s and Bank‟s strategy and priorities (previous and present
   CPS);
 innovative approaches to strengthen impact such as using standardized concrete
   structures, improve targeting by using community driven participatory approach, and
   enhancing monitoring by including survey based impact evaluation

These elements are balanced by the following:
 some shortcomings in the definition of indicators in results framework.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

This rating is based on:
 extensive collaboration between Bank and Borrower during supervision as a result of
   decentralized design (over 200 processes prior reviewed of which 67 tendering
   documents for works) and close follow-up of Project activities to ensure
   implementation success;
 energy intensive and time consuming implementation as a result of novel and
   complex multi sector approach of operation (see sections 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1 for
   additional details on operation approach);
 multisector operation successful supervision despite traditional operation supervision
   means;


                                           20
   Systematic procurement prior review to foster quality of the processes;
   close collaboration during political instability and lack of counterpart funding and
    pro-activity in liaising with new government teams;
   result oriented allowing satisfactory outcomes for PDO and key indicators as
    designed, with some caveats, and successful implementation of large number of
    activities.
   Pro-activity in bringing cutting edge practices in the state development agenda during
    Project execution (policies environment protection, territorial development and
    management, road maintenance management etc.);
   safeguards compliance through extensive monitoring, site visits and discussions;
   strong final review supported by impact evaluation survey, to be extended to new
    operation;
   recognition by client of need for further support and satisfaction with implementation
    of current loan to request new operation based on similar approach.

These elements are balanced by the following:
 no amendment of results framework during restructuring

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The rating of Satisfactory is based on an overall balanced assessment of Project quality at
entry and during supervision. In particular, this Project required intensive and frequent
supervision with greater Bank presence and flexibility to adjust and amplify activities to
match the Project complexity and the Client technical and financial capacity. Further, a
complex and novel multi sector approach was not adequately reflected by the monitoring
framework yet surrogate indicators in a survey-based study provide a degree of security
that overall development outcomes were achieved.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

This rating is based on:
    overall satisfactory policy dialogue, institutional set-up and general compliance
        with Bank norms and procedures;
    Commitment to overall Project implementation over the course of 4
        administration, and breakthrough in policy dialogue over sustainability,
        CREMAs, etc, as a result of sustained engagement;
    An overall financial commitment beyond the agreed resources from US$40
        million counterparts to approximately US$52 million counterparts, despite dire
        financial and fiscal overall context;
    significant efforts to catch-up with implementation delays and deficiencies in
        terms of counterpart funding since a new administration took office (January
        2011), with positive results in the final 9 months of the Project;

                                            21
    Full disbursement by Project closing date
This assessment is balanced by:
    challenges in decision making and fluctuating short term commitment as a result
       of political changes

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

This rating is based on
    Adequate general institutional capacity and effective management of the Project
        (technical, fiduciary and safeguards);
    Extra efforts to undertake over 200 different activities under a multisector Project;
This assessment is balanced by:
    institutionalization of Project management and knowledge could have been
        sought in a more systematic fashion.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on a balanced
approach between strong technical performances being undermined by a series of
political issues which were redeemed by a committed leadership at project end.

6. Lessons Learned

Political changes and policy shifts strongly impact Project implementation. Political
cycles had a clear impact on the rhythm of implementation of the Project. This challenge
is amplified in multi-sector operations given the larger number of entities involved in
implementation. To address this challenge, Projects should try to limit the number of
entities, recognize the risk or factor in political variables in Project design. Moreover, the
distribution of Bank and counterpart financing should take into account incentives or
disincentives at political levels, as was the case under this operation, to ensure that
activities with lower political visibility are still undertaken in a timely fashion.

In complex, multi-sector operations, attention to clear and functional institutional
arrangements are critical to ensure efficiency in Project management. Although
multiple institutions and stakeholders are involved in multi-sector operations, projects
should design some degree of centralization under a unified Project Implementation Unit
to make complex operations more manageable and expedite implementation, particularly
to facilitate multiple procurement processes. From the Bank‟s perspective, these multi-
sector operations that involve numerous activities and procurement processes inevitably
rely on strengthened and intensified Bank supervision.

Result indicators should be simple, measurable and with a direct causality to the actual
Project-financed activities. Opting for complex indicators to evaluate complex
operations may result in difficulties in monitoring indicators, despite appearing

                                             22
appropriate during project design. In cases where indicators prove to be inadequate in
reflecting results, due to their relevance or feasibility of monitoring, opportunities such as
mid-term reviews or restructuring should be used to evaluate their adequacy and potential
improvement in an updated Result Framework.

Impact evaluations provide an excellent tool to capture project impacts, yet there is still
much to learn to fully benefit from the potential. One issue is that in many cases, project
cycles do not necessarily correspond with impact cycles, particularly in areas such as
infrastructure where benefits are typically evident only after works are concluded.
Building impact evaluations into project design, while a good practice, should not
necessarily be bound to the project timeline. Furthermore, challenges in implementing the
evaluation highlighted that there is still much to learn regarding methodology (select
questions to best target project impacts), implementation (works do not take place at the
same time across locations so surveys must be staggered), and assessment (separate
between project impacts and external impacts) to fully benefit from the study‟s potential.

While participatory, bottom-up, demand-driven initiatives can improve the quality and
relevance of investments, clear communication and outreach are needed to foster and
sustain empowerment of populations. The participatory mechanism in the Project relied
on extensive consultation with each municipality that would first determine their local
development agenda, and then vote on roads that the government will improve that best
capture their needs. Although the Project was ground-breaking in fostering ownership of
political decisions by local populations through participatory mechanisms, it also
inadvertently created unfulfilled expectations that could have been avoided with clearer
communication and outreach. Given that the participatory mechanisms was a highly
successful tool, a lesson learned for future operations is to ensure the design of the
participatory mechanism is geographically appropriate, sufficient outreach and
communication are embedded to manage expectations, and monitoring of implementation
is undertaken to ensure sustainability of the empowerment sentiment.

Adopting a holistic approach in Project design is a useful approach to foster regional
development. A long term lesson learned through past Bank experiences in the State is
the need to move beyond narrow approaches to improving accessibility (focusing on
trunk infrastructure or isolated interventions on municipal roads), and adopting a more
integrated approach both vertically, within the road network to link various road levels to
provide seamless logistics, and horizontally among various other regional development
requirements. This “holistic? approach, which is inherently more complex to implement,
and to which the new proposed operation is ultimately responding, relies on strong
coordination between the different Government levels, ensuring that micro interventions
at local level are supplemented by investments undertaken at regional and national level.

   Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

   Introduction

   1.      This annex summarizes the cost-benefit analysis of the municipal roads
   improvement component. The economic evaluation follows a similar methodology as that
   adopted during Appraisal. However, several major changes have been taken into account
   based on: (i) pre- and post-Project historical agricultural production trends, (ii) updated
   production forecasts, (iii) updated unit values of benefit and cost parameters, and (iv)
   final Project implementation costs.

2. Economic benefits created by the component were analyzed using the Producer‟s Surplus
   approach considering that the interventions are mainly located on a network characterized
   by very low levels of traffic (often less than 50 vehicles per day) and the absence of
   alternative routes which made the common consumer surplus method inapplicable. The
   net present value (NPV) of the economic benefits generated over the 10 years is
   estimated at about R$27.5 million (US$15 million) at a 12% discount rate, and its
   economic internal rate of return is estimated at 20.2%.

   Impact of the Improvement on agricultural and livestock production in Tocantins

   3.      Agricultural production in the Eastern part of the State of Tocantins is dominated
   by five products: rice, sugar-cane, cassava, corn, and soy-beans. In addition, two products
   were included for livestock and for derived products, considering their respective weight
   in the total production: meat and milk.

   4.      Improvement to all weather conditions of the municipal feeder roads were
   expected to result in: (i) reduction of overall production costs, notably, reductions in
   transport costs, decrease in stocks, and reduction of losses accounting to transport and
   stocking; (ii) productivity gains, differing depending on the products; (iii) increased size
   of cultivated areas; and (iv) faster changes towards more productive agriculture in areas
   where available land is scarce.

   Evaluation of benefits and costs

   5.     The producer surplus was calculated as the increase in the value of production net
   of production costs, resulting from the investments, within the area of influence of the
   road. The following methodological hypotheses were taken: (i) investments have a
   negligible impact on the local consumption of local goods; (ii) investments have a
   negligible impact on global market prices; and (iii) impacts on the cost of road
   maintenance resulting from possible traffic growth was not taken into account.

   6.     The producer surplus evaluation is based on the following steps: (i) the area of
   influence of the improved roads was estimated; (ii) the average characteristics of farms
   and main types of productions within the area of influence of the road were identified (iii)
   the computation of the value-added for each type of product in both the with and without

                                               34
Project case scenarios was based on historical series and previous experiences; (iv)
producer surplus is estimated as a difference in value-added between the with and
without Project case scenarios; and (v) NPV and IRR were obtained based on the
estimated surplus and Project costs.

7.     The analysis at completion incorporated the following changes vis a vis the
estimation at Appraisal:

               a. Implementation was delayed. The Project implementation was planned
                  to begin in 2004 and to be completed in four years. However, the
                  implementation period was extended to seven years starting in 2006.
                  Accordingly, the timeframe of the economic evaluation was also
                  changed. Originally the evaluation period was 2003-2013, and now it
                  is 2006-2016. It is also assumed that benefits were generated only after
                  2009.
               b. Area of influence of Project roads was reduced. Since the budget was
                  shrunk after the Real appreciated against US Dollar from US$1 = R$
                  2.9 at Appraisal to R$1.7 at completion, the total number of kilometers
                  intervened under the Project was reduced from the envisaged 5,670
                  km, to 5,121 km (falling by 550 km). Accordingly, the area of
                  influence of the Project was reduced to 39% of the Eastern region,
                  instead of 44%.
               c. Agricultural production significantly increased. Some of productions
                  have a significantly higher value than was forecasted at Appraisal. For
                  example, the value of soy-bean production had grown by 5 times
                  during the 9 year period even after adjusting for inflation. The analysis
                  used the latest production data available for 2009.

8.     The annual value of investments under the component was based on the actual
payment values for the contracts including works, designs, and supervision. No
maintenance costs are assumed because structures developed by the component require
minimum maintenance. Data for 2012 are estimates based on sales contracts.

9.     The area of influence is limited to 5 km on each side of the road segment.
Assuming the total length under the component is 5,121km and an average length of each
segment is 15km, the total area of influence is 39% of the area of all 67 municipalities in
Eastern Tocantins.

10.     Agricultural production was derived from data at the level of each municipality in
2009. Since the detailed production data is available only for 2001 and 2009, the total
production in the base year of 2006 was estimated with a weighted average of 2001 and
2009. The Project is assumed to contribute to the following improvements in production:
i) area of cultivation for all types of crops will increase annually at 2.5% in 2009-2012
and 5.4% in 2012- 2016; (ii) productivities of all crops (production per area) grows at 1%
per year in 2009-2012 and remains constant after 2013; and (iii) production of livestock
goes up at 1% annually in 2009-2016. Meanwhile, in the without-Project case scenario,
both production area and productivity stay at the same level as 2006.

                                            35
11.     Value-added of each production was obtained by subtracting costs from
production values. The costs of production were based on existing statistics. While the
Project is assumed to reduce the costs of production for all crops at 1% per year between
2009 and 2016, the costs do not change in the without-Project case scenario.

Results

13.     Computed on a 10-year period, the net present value (NPV) of the subcomponent,
at a 12% discount rate, is estimated at R$27.5 million (US$15 million) and the internal
rate of return (IRR) yields 20.2%. The analysis included all of the 67 municipalities
comprised in the Project.

SUMMARY OF CLIENT’S ICR:

General context of the Project
During implementation, the Project had different phases of execution that may be
summarized as follow:
(i) Slow beginning, with more than 1 year between approval by the Bank on December
      9, 2003 and effectiveness, December 20, 2004, for reasons beyond the reach of both
      the Bank and the State of Tocantins. This was further compounded by initial delays
      in (a) contracting the first activities due to the election year both at the State and
      municipal levels, (b) coordinate the different fronts of activities between the
      different institutions involved, (c) insufficient allocation of counterpart funds
(ii) 2005-2008 – Satisfying implementation: there was a partial recovery of the initial
      delays during the period.
(iii) 2009-2010 – New obstacles and new delays: in the period 2009-2010, new obstacle
      occurred which impacted Project implementation, including the national crisis on
      concrete and steel, the impeachment of the Governor Miranda, an interim
      government and budget shortages in 2009 and 2010 (about 15%)
(iv) 2011 – A new priority: on January 1st, 2011, the new Governor Siqueira Campos
      identified the finalization of the Project as one of his priorities. Despite difficulties in
      mobilizing counterpart funds, the Government concluded on time the Project
      disbursements and most of the planned activities.

State overall assessment of the Project outcome

The Project allowed the introduction of substantial improvements in three fundamental
pillars of the development in Tocantins: regional and local development planning and
management, environmental protection and territorial management and upgrading and
maintenance of the state and municipal roads.

Fostering planning and regional management of public programs based on technical,
economical and environmental criteria, as well as the increased participation of
communities allowed strengthening: (i) existing Projects, through the implantation of 4
regional development councils (Conder) and local fora; (ii) strengthening the
management capacity of municipalities with technical support, training and information
via the creation of 4 technical regional units (UTR).

In environment protection, and water management, the Project managed significant
achievements, including the creation of various tools from planning studies, such as water
resources management plans, irrigation masterplan, environmental programs of
sustainable biodiversity conservation etc. to technical studies and tools, such as
assessment of underground water use, hidrometeorological planning study, implantation
of hidrometeorological stations. The Project also contributed to strengthen the institutions
in charge of environmental management and the Project helped mobilizing the society on
the question of environment as well. For the first time, it was possible to identify priority
areas for conservation of biodiversity in the State, assess socio-economic parameters of

                                               41
influence, and the tendencies of human occupation of the territories, as well as formulate
actions to protect natural resources. This led to the selection of 18 areas. The Project
helped building public policies on environment and support tools for sustainable
development such as fauna and fish protection, irrigation, as well as management
instruments such as on authorization of the use of water resources.

The Project helped improving accessibility to areas of production in the regions of Bico
de Papagaio, Nordeste, Jalapao and Sudeste, the State Poorest regions. This better
integration between the municipal feeder roads and the State road network fostered the
competitiveness of the productive areas and eased access to social services to the
populations. On the institutional side, the Project supported a number of activities which
contributed to improve the state management capacity.

Despite challenges mentioned above that took place during the lifetime of the loan, and
some technical shortcomings outlined in the client‟s lessons learned, the Client
acknowledges that the Project was able to overcome those challenges, resulting in, on its
assessment, an overall fully satisafactory performance of the project, which is reflected in
the accomplishment of the majority of the indicators.

CLIENT’S ICR:
Contexto geral do Projeto
Ao longo da implementação do projeto, o PDRS teve fases distintas que podem ser divididas em:
(i)     Início Lento, hiato de mais de 1 ano entre a aprovação do Projeto pelo Banco no dia 09 de
dezembro de 2003 e a sua declaração de efetividade em 20 de dezembro de 2004, por motivos alheios tanto
ao Banco quanto ao Estado do Tocantins e atrasos específicos no início do Projeto para: (a) contratar as
primeiras atividades devido ao ano de eleições estaduais e municipais; (b) coordenar as várias frentes de
atividades dos diferentes Órgãos envolvidos; e, (c) alocar verbas suficientes de contrapartida;
(ii)    2005-2008 – Desempenho Satisfatório: houve uma recuperação parcial dos atrasos neste período,
conforme destacado nas missões técnicas do Banco em visita ao Estado entre o final de 2007 e final de
2008. As respectivas “Ajuda Memória? constatam o bom desempenho na execução do projeto;
(iii) 2009-2010 – Fatores inéditos e nova lentidão: no decorrer dos anos de 2009 e 2010, outros fatores
inéditos interferiram no andamento do projeto, em particular, tais como a crise nacional do cimento e do
aço; o julgamento de um Recurso contra Expedição de Diploma (RCED) contra o governador Marcelo
Miranda, que culminou na cassação de seu mandato; o início de um governo interino e a frustração de
receita nos anos de 2009 e 2010 (cerca de 15%).
(iv) 2011 – Conclusão prioritária: em 1º de janeiro de 2011 assume o Governo Siqueira Campos, e
elege como uma de suas metas prioritárias a finalização do PDRS. Mesmo com dificuldades de
mobilização de recursos financeiros o Governo concluiu todo o desembolso do projeto dentro do prazo de
finalização do contrato.

 Avaliação dos Objetivos, por macro componente
Planejamento e gestão do desenvolvimento regional e local
A estratégia do projeto consistiu reforçar esse aspecto a partir de: (i) novos mecanismos de planejamento
multisetorial participativo, ao nível operacional e regional; e, (ii) do reforço da capacidade de planejamento
e gerenciamento de programas.
No primeiro segmento, o projeto focou:
         na preparação de Agendas de Desenvolvimento Municipais, com plena participação das
populações locais, em todos os 67 municípios beneficiados pelo PDRS. As agendas de desenvolvimento
municipais representaram um marco importante, pois foram trabalhos pioneiros na sistematização das
demandas da sociedade local, anteriormente restringiam-se ao levantamento de dados secundários e
cenários, tendo uma conotação eminentemente tecnocrática.
         na criação de 4 Conselhos de Desenvolvimento Regionais – CONDERs, dos quais se criou 4,
inicialmente na região Sudeste e ao final na região Nordeste. Nas regiões do Bico do Papagaio e do
Jalapão, já haviam Programas de territórios de cidadania (patrocinados pelo Governo Federal). Foi
acordado que poderia ser redundante criar-se uma nova instância consultiva. Os fóruns apresentam um
papel relevante, pois representou uma oportunidade da sociedade em indicar investimentos prioritários para
o governo estadual, mas também o federal e conhecer melhor a própria região, pois seu conhecimento
ficava circunscrito basicamente ao seu espaço local.
 na preparação de 4 Agendas de Desenvolvimento.
No segundo segmento, o projeto focou:
 na criação de 4 Unidades Técnicas Regionais (UTRs) para darem apoio técnico aos CONDERs;
 Em relação ao cumprimento da Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal;
 reforçar o Sistema de planejamento Estadual.

Gerenciamento ambiental do Estado
Nesse componente o PDRS objetivou: (i) consolidar os zoneamentos regionais; (ii) aumentar o número de
áreas de proteção; e, (iii) aprimorar e institucionalizar ferramentas de gerenciamento do uso do solo.

Na implementação do primeiro segmento houve divergências de abordagem conceitual quanto ao tipo de
zoneamento ambiental a ser executado. Considerou-se que a definição de zoneamento ambiental na
modalidade ecológico-econômico equivaleria ao sistema de apoio ao ordenamento de uso da terra com base
georrefenciada, visando tanto a expansão produtiva, a conservação/proteção ambiental (conservação da
biodiversidade e dos recursos hídricos, quanto a mitigação dos impactos), tendo como base a
compartimentação da paisagem. Houveram diversas interações técnicas entre o Banco e a Seplan, que


                                                     43
culminaram com a apresentação e pré-aprovação, por parte do Banco, de termos de referencias para
possíveis e futuras conduções de atividades (compartimentação ambiental, e zoneamento ecológico-
econômico). Além disso, no período houve avanço significativo na condução de estudos básicos ambientais
(i- estudo da dinâmica da cobertura e uso da terra; ii- mapeamento das regiões fitoecológicas), em maior
detalhe escalar, fundamentais para a compartimentação da paisagem, que irá subsidiar a definição de zonas
ecológico-econômicas.
No segundo vetor desse componente, foram efetuadas atividades de avaliação ecológica rápida em áreas
prioritárias para conservação ambiental, onde foram indicadas 18 áreas como sendo prioritárias. Até o
momento nenhuma delas foi institucionalizada, mas mais de 90% do processo foi realizado, uma vez que a
etapa subseqüente dependerá apenas de consultas públicas e da edição de Lei específica
As ferramentas referentes ao terceiro vetor referem-se à implementação do Licenciamento Florestal da
Propriedade Rural (LFPR), Cadastro Ambiental Rural (CAR) ou outras ações de Comando e Controle do
então Órgão executor da Política Ambiental do Estado do Tocantins (Naturatins), especificamente para
monitoramento do uso e cobertura da terra. Quaisquer das ferramentas foram implantadas. As razões
primordiais foram: (i) o atraso na condução de atividades previstas no macrocomponente Consolidação do
Sistema de Proteção Ambiental e Gestão Territorial, que subsidiariam a construção de estudos que dariam
suporte a tais ferramentas, e.g. Estudo da Dinâmica da Cobertura e Uso da Terra; (ii) e alterações na
estrutura do Governo Estadual, que promoveu durante determinado período, alterações nos vínculos
institucionais entre o órgão executor da política ambiental (Naturatins) e os órgãos responsáveis pela
condução do PDRS.

Melhoramento e conservação de rodovias estaduais e municipais
Seus subcomponentes foram: (i) eliminação de pontos críticos de estradas vicinais municipais prioritárias
das regiões que compõem a faixa leste do Estado; (ii) melhorias em estradas estaduais de conexão; (iii) dois
contratos-piloto de manutenção remunerados por desempenho; (iv) reforço da capacidade do DERTINS em
planejamento, operação e controle.
O primeiro subcomponente (vicinais) é a âncora do PDRS. A meta de eliminação de 85% dos pontos
críticos da malha municipal beneficiada foi suplantada. Dos 67 municípios contemplados a maior parte foi
finalizada no horizonte do empréstimo. Seis contratos de obras foram suspensos por falta de capacidade ou
de interesse das licitantes vencedoras, e o Estado já iniciou novas licitações (fev 2012), inteiramente
lastreadas em recursos próprios. Por constituir o principal foco do PDRS, maiores detalhes constam na
Parte 6 deste Relatório.
As melhorias em estradas de conexão (estaduais) foram implantadas e consistiram em obras de preparacao
a pavimentacao (bueiros celulares), ja que volumes de tráfego eram insuficientes para justificar
economicamente de pavimentaçao e. Ao total foram atendidos 143 Km de rodovias com eliminação de
pontos críticos e reabilitação. Os trechos beneficiados foram Dianópolis/Conceição do Tocantins e Palmas-
Paraíso do Tocantins.
Contratos-piloto: O valor do componente foi estimado no PAD em US$ 4,6 milhões. Os contratos-piloto
para as estradas municipais (vicinais, não pavimentadas) foram excluídos após exame dos prós e contras. O
principal fator (contra) foi a vulnerabilidade dessas vicinais aos fatores climáticos adversos e aleatórios, e a
tendência do setor privado em embutir tais riscos nos seus preços propostos. O valor de US$ 4,6 milhões,
após exercícios de simulação efetuados, seria suficiente para menos de 1.000 km nos quais constassem
serviços de restauração + 3 anos de conserva.
No subcomponente de reforço do Órgão Rodoviário destacam-se os seguintes aspectos: a malha estadual
(pavimentada e não-pavimentada) foi inteiramente georeferrenciada e o órgão mantém o banco de dados
atualizado por meios próprios. O sistema de conhecimento de trafego (volume médio diário de veículos,
por tipo de veículo) foi 100% implantado. O sistema também é mantido pelos próprios funcionários. Foram
feitos dois exercícios de avaliação da condição dos pavimentos para toda malha pavimentada estadual, com
plena participação de funcionários das áreas técnica e de conserva. Foram treinados mais de 200
funcionários em diversos temas técnicos e gerenciais, segundo sete categorias (Administrativa e Financeira,
Construção e Manutenção de Rodovias, Georreferenciamento, Meio Ambiente, Operação e Segurança,
Planejamento rodoviário e Informática). Um subproduto positivo não previsto originalmente, foi o elevado
grau de satisfação demonstrado pela maior parte dos(as) treinandos(as) em termos de percepção de sua
valorização.

Compilações das Lições Aprendidas
Descrição sumária do ambiente em que o projeto se desenvolveu

                                                      44
Considerando os aspectos político-administrativos, o PDRS foi um projeto com baixa percepção de
ganho político, não tendo sido prioritário por parte dos governantes. Este problema foi potencializado em
função das trocas de governadores que ocorreram principalmente quando o projeto deveria ter sua maior
execução. Ao total houveram 3 (três) governantes em um período de 3 (três) anos.
Nos aspectos financeiros e de câmbio, entre os entrevistados foi unânime a percepção que este último
gerou uma perda inesperada em relação ao montante financeiro disponível para o projeto. O dólar
referência usado no Project Appraisal Document – PAD foi de R$ 2,9 e o dólar médio ao longo do projeto
foi de R$ 1,80. A despeito disto, existe uma percepção que o impacto na execução física do projeto foi
inferior à redução financeira causada pelo câmbio, em função de um acompanhamento da execução dos
contratos.
Um outro aspecto considerado foi o atraso do pagamento das contrapartidas, o que gerou desinteresse por
parte dos empresários.

Principais Lições Gerais do Projeto
Pontos Fortes
 Arranjo institucional aplicado para a gestão do PDRS adequado, tanto no tamanho quanto na integração
da equipe;
 Integração da UGP a um órgão com poder de decisão, onde as gerências vinculadas possuem
autonomia;
 Líder do projeto atuante, garantido o bom andamento das atividades e a integração das equipes;
 Equipes focadas no desenvolvimento do projeto, deixando de lado as vaidades pessoais e a disputa por
poder;
 Confiança mútua entre as gerências;
 Melhora nos aspectos gerencias com a mudança da empresa gerenciadora do projeto. Mas deve-se
considerar o risco - havendo troca no gerenciamento, caso a nova empresa não se adeque a filosofia de
trabalho já existente na equipe;
 Interação entre a Comissão de Licitação e o Controle Interno, melhorando o andamento das aquisições
gerais do projeto. Deve-se considerar como ganho de agilidade devido a Comissão de Licitação ser no
próprio Órgão Rodoviário;
 Minimização de problemas com a capacitação dos setores envolvidos no processo (controle interno e
auditoria);
 Capacidade de adaptação, garantindo um desempenho satisfatório, mesmo com as dificuldades
financeiras relacionadas ao câmbio e aos atrasos das contrapartidas (estas dificuldades precisam ser
consideradas para os próximos projetos).
 Reforço institucional através de consultores, garantindo segurança e equilíbrio ao projeto, além de
apoiar a integração com outros setores envolvidos, utilizando-se de métodos democráticos e participativos.
 Aplicação de treinamentos, gerando uma melhoria na qualidade dos serviços.
Pontos Fracos
 Dificuldade de acesso à informação, que poderia ser resolvido com um sistema integrado;
 Falta de compreensão do escopo total do projeto por parte de todas as equipes;
 Modelo para contratação de treinamentos (incluindo pessoa física) complicado, o que compromete a
execução. Melhoraria com a formulação de pacotes maiores;
 Necessidade de uma reserva financeira para garantir a execução dos contratos no período sem
orçamento;
 Critérios utilizados para medição das obras pouco definidos;
 Critérios para medição das vigas deve ser revisto (percentuais pagos por fase).

Principais Lições do Componente Rodoviário
Pontos Fortes
 A contratação de uma fábrica para a construção das vigas gerou um ganho de escala que barateou o
preço das mesmas;
 Apresentação de alternativas aos projetos-tipo estabelecidos, com mais opções de construção, inclusive
nas extensões dos aterros de encabeçamento das pontes e de cobertura dos bueiros, de forma de adequá-los
às condições diferenciadas encontradas no campo;



                                                   45
 Na fase de construção, emissão das OS´s iniciais para as empresas construtoras somente depois de
confirmar se os equipamentos e pessoal apresentados são adequados e suficientes para as obras;
 Respeito do Edital e só dar a obra como concluída depois de atendidas às recomendações indicadas pela
Diretoria de Meio-ambiente;
 Todos os contratos de obras foram executados sem aditivo de preços, o que é raro;
 Uma vez sendo regularizados os pagamentos, a resposta das empresas foi bastante positiva e o
cronograma final para a conclusão do projeto foi cumprido.
Pontos Fracos
 A não inclusão de bueiros celulares ou galerias, mais baratos, de mais simples execução (seções pré-
moldadas) e com seção pré-fixada como alternativa às pontes de 5 metros.
 O número reduzido de fiscais nas obras impossibilitando o controle mais apurado, que acaba por
comprometer a qualidade da execução.
 Faltou dar maior importância as condições das instalações da empreiteira na obra, principalmente,
quando ao local de confecção dos bueiros, observando as condições de execução e os materiais
empregados.
 A inclusão de pontos de controle para que a fiscalização pudesse dar aprovação a algumas etapas da
obra, como a cota de fundação dos pilares, por exemplo, e só então autorizar a continuidade.
 O excessivo número de contratos de execução, um por município, fazendo com que empresas menores,
com menor experiência e capital, obtivessem contratos.
 Obras executadas em estradas estreitas, até com 4 metros de largura, entre cercas, o que veio a criar
dificuldades, principalmente para a drenagem superficial. Os municípios deveriam estabelecer uma largura
mínima, de 6 a 8 metros, como condição para melhoramentos e manutenção.
 A pouca atenção dada ao item Melhoria de Greide, aplicada a somente em alguns poucos pontos
notadamente críticos. Posteriormente, pode-se observar a necessidade de maiores extensões para garantir a
perenidade do tráfego.
 Ampliação da aplicação de revestimento primário, em todos os trechos que tiverem recebido obras,
exceto nos que já possuírem e, naturalmente, nos que sofreram Melhorias no Greide.
 Percorrer os trechos escolhidos nas Audiências Públicas, com o projetista para que o Órgão possa ter
conhecimento prévio estimado das obras que serão necessárias.
 Cobrar da Supervisora maior atenção para as condições de trabalho, por vezes precárias, infringidas aos
trabalhadores.

Meio-Ambiente:
O componente ambiental do PDRS foi definido no Macro-componente Consolidação do Sistema de
Proteção Ambiental e Gestão Territorial composto pelas ações e atividades consideradas prioritárias que
foram extraídas do Plano Estratégico para a Gestão Territorial do Tocantins.
O Macro-componente foi estruturado para estabelecer um processo de compatibilização das atividades de
uso dos recursos naturais e ocupação do espaço territorial, com as características e qualidade dos ambientes
natural e antropogênico, visando permitir a derivação de bem estar para todos os grupos humanos
envolvidos e que, ao mesmo tempo, seja sustentável, através da conservação dos recursos para as futuras
gerações.
A Consolidação do Sistema de Proteção Ambiental e Gestão Territorial foi centrada no ZEE e contemplou
um grande leque de ações inter-relacionadas e interdependentes, que foram realizadas considerando todo o
Estado, através de ?reas Prioritárias que englobam Regiões Administrativas / ?reas-programa, segundo
uma seqüência de realizações estabelecidas em função de decisões do governo e/ou por demanda social. As
ações foram agrupadas em oito componentes:
    planejamento do uso/ordenamento da ocupação das terras no Tocantins com participação social;
    promoção do crescimento e aperfeiçoamento do capital social;
    preservação da biodiversidade, proteção de ecossistemas e habitats no Tocantins;
    aprimoramento do conhecimento sobre recursos naturais e socioeconômicos;
    regulação e incentivo do uso da terra;
    monitoramento socioambiental;
    manutenção do sistema de proteção ambiental e de uso das terras e


                                                    46
     administração e marketing do sistema de GTER do Tocantins.
Pontos Fortes
 Foram feitos os estudos da Dinâmica da Cobertura e Uso da Terra, o Mapeamento das Regiões
Fitoecológicas e Inventário Florestal – trazem a combinação de técnicas de interpretação de imagens de
satélites, a manipulação de dados socioeconômicos, análises de especialistas, e fundamentalmente,
exaustivos levantamentos de campo. Os produtos gerados no trabalho permitiram a qualificação e
quantificação dos diversos tipos de usos das terras e dos remanescentes de vegetação nativa, além disso,
foram identificados os fatores ambientais e socioeconômicos que interferiam na dinâmica de uso do espaço
regional. Tais informações permitem o subsídio à compartimentação do planejamento e uso da paisagem
(zoneamento ecológico-econômico), de forma a apoiar as políticas de gestão / ordenamento territorial, tanto
em termos de conservação e proteção ambiental, quanto de expansão / consolidação das atividades
produtivas, especialmente agropecuárias. Auxiliará também a definição de ações estratégicas para definição
de investimentos em agropecuária, silvicultura e industrialização, potencializando o desenvolvimento do
estado.
 Foram instaladas estações meteorológicas que permitiram melhorar o monitoramento das condições
climáticas no Estado;
 Foi melhorado o gerenciamento ambiental do Tocantins a partir da elaboração de estudos, planos e
programas e a criação de Políticas para segmentos vitais ao desenvolvimento do Estado.
 O tratamento da gestão ambiental no PDRS deve servir de molde para as obras da conservação
rodoviária de estradas não pavimentadas do Órgão Rodoviário. O licenciamento simplificado e uma gestão
ambiental enxuta possibilitaram a execução de um número muito grande de obras, com somente 2
denúncias e 1 processo no Ministério Público Federal.
Pontos Fracos
 Houve descompasso de informação entre Projeto licenciado no NATURATINS e o que foi executado.
Foram comuns as alegações de desconhecimento de detalhes e recomendações técnicas do Projeto
Executivo e do Projeto Ambiental por parte dos responsáveis pelas obras;
 O Estado não conseguiu implementar os indicadores propostos pelo PDRS.

Desenvolvimento Regional
Pontos Fortes
 A elaboração das agendas, diagnósticos e planos de desenvolvimento local representou uma etapa
importante no conhecimento dos principais aspectos dos municípios, subsidiando a formulação dos PPA‟s
2004/2007 e 2008/2011 do Estado do Tocantins;
 A criação e fortalecimento dos CMDR´s – Conselhos Municipais de Desenvolvimento Sustentáveis
foram importantes para o posterior estabelecimento dos Fóruns de Desenvolvimento Regional, o que
proporciona legalmente o acesso das comunidades a determinadas políticas públicas, principalmente do
Governo Federal, desta forma o Projeto contribuiu para potencializar os recursos destinados as
comunidades, notadamente, nos Ministérios do Desenvolvimento Agrário e da Integração Nacional, por
meio dos Programas Territórios da Cidadania e Mesorregiões, todos nas áreas de abrangência do PDRS
(Bico do Papagaio, Jalapão e Sudeste);
 O Plano Estratégico Regional da Região Sudeste subsidiou a elaboração do PPA 2008/2011 Estadual e
o da Região Nordeste, apresentado em julho/2011, subsidiou a elaboração do PPA 2012/2015, o que ao
nosso entender representou uma boa oportunidade de melhor entendimento da dinâmica regional e, por
conseguinte a formulação de políticas públicas calçadas na realidade local;
 A estrutura das Unidades Técnicas Regionais UTR, incluindo instalações, equipamentos, automóveis,
etc., foi apropriada para o desenvolvimento das atividades nas regiões;
 As capacitações dos servidores municipais e estaduais contribuíram para um melhor entendimento da
importância das Políticas de Desenvolvimento Regional e os principais instrumentos técnicos de análise
regional. As empresas contratadas tinham a devida competência e experiência e os conteúdos e a linguagem
apropriados. A participação dos servidores estaduais foi efetiva e com resultados importantes em relação à
elaboração de Projetos e do Plano Plurianual, que tem proporcionado o fortalecimento das equipes de
Planejamento nos Órgãos Setoriais e ampliado as discussões transversais e um modelo de gestão para
resultados.
Pontos Fracos
 Os produtos gerados foram amplamente utilizados pelo poder público Estadual, mas não foram
internalizados da mesma forma na elaboração dos PPA´s municipais, inclusive como material de pesquisa

                                                    47
pelo poder público local. Por outro lado forneceu elementos de discussão/debate para os Conselhos e
Fóruns (informação/formação do capital social) para reivindicar ações estabelecidas nos Planos para o
desenvolvimento local e regional.
 Apesar da estrutura apropriada das Unidades Técnicas Regionais – UTR e da boa formação acadêmica
dos servidores selecionados, estes possuíam pouca experiência na administração pública e na interação
entre grupos, ou seja, a equipe foi se habilitando no desenvolvimento dos trabalhos. Desta forma
entendemos que é necessária uma qualificação/aperfeiçoamento inicial da equipe da Seplan e uma
definição objetiva das atribuições e missão das UTR´s, inclusive para dimensionar a equipe necessária para
o desenvolvimento das atividades.
 A criação de consórcios intermunicipais foi comprometida devido ao Estado não tem governabilidade
plena, pois os municípios possuem autonomia para aceitar e ainda dependem de aprovação nas Câmaras
Municipais, desta forma o Estado no PDRS não conseguiu estabelecer um modelo jurídico e de
incentivos/desincentivos financeiros aos municípios para formação de consórcios, limitando-se a reuniões
com Prefeitos e Secretários Municipais, necessárias, mas não suficientes para o estabelecimento de
Consórcios.

 Avaliação do Desempenho do Banco Mundial e Lições Aprendidas
A avaliação feita do desempenho do Banco Mundial considerou os aspectos gerais nas fases de preparação
e supervisão:
 Durante a preparação do projeto as discussões técnicas e o apoio para a elaboração do projeto foram
muito produtivas;
 O relacionamento durante a preparação foi muito bom, podendo o Banco ser considerado um excelente
parceiro;
 Ao longo da supervisão do projeto, o relacionamento foi melhorado;
 A partir do reconhecimento técnico da equipe do projeto houve um aumento da confiança por parte do
Banco;
 Durante a supervisão, o Banco foi presente e atuante, colaborando para a conclusão do projeto.

Indicadores de Desempenho
Macrocomponente: Planejamento e gestão do desenvolvimento regional e local
 INDICADOR: Número de agendas de desenvolvimento municipais finalizadas e preparadas por fóruns
 municipais de desenvolvimento: 20 até o fim de 2003; 40 até o fim de 2005; 60 até o fim de 2007.
 Indic : 67
 Nos municípios de Mateiros e São Félix do Tocantins foram utilizados seus Planos Diretores, nos quais podem
 ser encontradas as prioridades econômicas, sociais e ambientais para o desenvolvimento municipal, e que foram
 construídas com ampla participação da comunidade, desta forma consideramos como agenda de prioridades
 locais.
 O indicador foi apropriado, bem como as estratégias de coleta de dados, com relatórios de progresso e
 realizações das agendas. No entanto, o acompanhamento dos resultados e divulgação para os conselhos
 municipais de desenvolvimento rural sustentável e fóruns de desenvolvimento, acompanhou com maior ênfase
 à evolução das ações das obras e ações de desenvolvimento do PDRS. Como a agenda local possui um conjunto
 de ações nas áreas de saúde, educação, infraestrutura, segurança pública, meio ambiente, gestão pública,
 produção, assistência social com responsabilidade nas três esferas de governo (Federal, Estadual, Municipal),
 ações de responsabilidade da sociedade civil organizada e Instituições para-estatais como SEBRAE, SESI,
 SENAR e outros, as ações realizadas/não-realizadas não tiveram a mesma sistemática de acompanhamento, o
 que limitou, por conseguinte a avaliação da execução da política pública estadual e municipal, considerando a
 eficiência, eficácia e efetividade.
 O grande avanço a ser implementado agora será um mecanismo de acompanhamento e de responsabilização
 dos envolvidos na implementação das agendas.

 INDICADOR: Número de CONDER pilotos estabelecidos: 2 até o fim de 2005; 4 até o fim de 2006.
 Indic: 4
 A formação de Fóruns regionais depende fundamentalmente da criação e fortalecimento dos CMDR´s –
 Conselhos Municipais de Desenvolvimento Sustentáveis. Na região do Bico-do-Papagaio, foi possível a
 revitalização de 14 CMDR´s e a criação de 4 CMDR´s, no Jalapão foram criados 2 CMDR´s, na região Sudeste
 foram criados em todos os municípios os CMDR´s (20 conselhos) e na região Nordeste também foram criados

                                                   48
todos os 14 municípios os seus CMDR´s. A partir da criação dos conselhos municipais tornou-se possível a
criação dos Conselhos de Desenvolvimento Regionais – CONDER‟s. Foram estabelecidos 2 fóruns, sendo 1 de
desenvolvimento municipal na região sudeste até o final de 2008 e 1 na região nordeste ao final de 2010. Na
região do Bico do Papagaio e Jalapão por serem integrantes dos Programas Territórios da Cidadania e
Mesorregião, do Ministério do Desenvolvimento Agrário e Ministério da Integração Nacional, os fóruns
regionais foram estabelecidos com esforços conjuntos das Equipes do PDRS, Ministérios, Prefeituras e
Sociedade Civil, desta forma, as Instituições participantes e a sociedade local chegaram ao consenso que não
havia a necessidade de criar outro fórum, cujos objetivos são comuns.

INDICADOR: Número de agendas de desenvolvimento regional finalizadas: 1 até o fim de 2006 e 04 até o
fim de 2008.
Indic: 4
Foi elaborado o plano de projetos de investimentos prioritários para o setor produtivo realizado pelo
Ministério da Integração Nacional, Governo do Tocantins, Prefeituras Municipais e Sociedade Civil, no
Programa das Mesorregiões para o Bico do Papagaio, por isso consideramos como agenda de
desenvolvimento regional. As duas outras agendas de desenvolvimento regionais elaboradas, foram para a
região Sudeste, em 2008 de forma participativa, que subsidiou a elaboração do PPA Estadual para região
2008/2011 e os PPA´s municipais da região para o período 2010/2013. O plano de desenvolvimento regional
do Nordeste foi validado com a sociedade local e prefeitos municipais em junho/2011. Na Região do Jalapão,
priorizou-se acompanhar as agendas de desenvolvimento local e revisão dos planos diretores, desta forma, não
foi possível a elaboração de agendas de desenvolvimento regional.

INDICADOR: Número de UTR´s estabelecidas: 2 até o fim 2004; 4 até o fim 2006.
Indic: 4
Indicador apropriado, estratégia de coleta de dados também. As Unidades Técnicas Regionais foram
imprescindíveis para o desenvolvimento de ações de criação dos conselhos municipais, os fóruns regionais e a
elaboração das agendas locais e regionais e no processo de articulação entre a Seplan, Prefeituras Municipais
e Sociedade Civil. O trabalho conjunto com as consultorias contratadas, proporcionou um aprendizado
importante para os técnicos das UTR´s e servidores municipais na área de desenvolvimento local. No entanto,
as UTR´s não foram suficientemente capacitadas para o apoio as administrações municipais nos instrumentos
de planejamento, orçamento e finanças, cujas ações foram desenvolvidas, basicamente por técnicos da Seplan.
Na reestruturação das UTR´s para que estas possam desenvolver suas atividades com maior abrangência e
eficiência, torna-se necessário o reforço quantitativo e qualitativo do quadro técnico lotado nas UTR´s e sua
inserção no conjunto de atribuições da Seplan e das Regiões Administrativas.

INDICADOR: Número de consórcios intermunicipais criados: 1 até o fim de 2005; 4 até o fim de 2008.
Indic: 0
A criação de consórcios intermunicipais é um processo relativamente complexo e o Estado não tem
governabilidade plena, pois os municípios possuem autonomia para aceitar e ainda dependem de aprovação
nas Câmaras Municipais. No PDRS o Estado não conseguiu estabelecer um modelo jurídico e de
incentivos/desincentivos financeiros aos municípios para formação de consórcios. Foram realizadas reuniões e
apresentações para prefeitos, vereadores e secretários municipais, sobre consórcios intermunicipais,
principalmente na região Sudeste do Estado, onde verificamos um processo de cooperação (informal) entre os
prefeitos municipais para recuperação de estradas vicinais, no entanto, não conseguimos avançar, pois foram
alianças pontuais e os prefeitos apresentaram como reivindicação a necessidade de uma contrapartida do
Estado, o que não foi possível estabelecer. A instabilidade política (Recurso Contra Expedição De
Diploma RCED, que culminou com a cassação do Governador, indefinição do mandado do substituto,
eleição indireta e mandato de 15 meses, com a eleição do Pres. da Assembléia Legislativa para o Governo do
Estado) verificada no período de 2007 a 2010 no Estado atrapalhou sobremaneira a estratégia de criação dos
consórcios. Destacamos que alguns municípios receberam patrulhas mecanizadas por meio de emendas
parlamentares, mas antes da Lei No. 11.107, de 6 de abril de 2005, que dispõe sobre normas gerais de
contratação de consórcios públicos, que estabeleceu as normas gerais para a União, os Estados, o Distrito
Federal e os Municípios para contratarem consórcios públicos para a realização de objetivos de interesse
comum. Não faltaram exemplos de conflitos judiciais entre os municípios por discordâncias na condução dos
trabalhos realizados em formas de parcerias, ou mesmo parcerias informais de curto prazo. Portanto, torna-se
imprescindível estabelecer um modelo de consórcios com forte embasamento jurídico, aliança política e

                                                  49
 incentivos a sua formação.

 INDICADOR: Aumento do número de prestação de contas municipais conforme a LRF: 20% até o fim 2005;
 30% até o fim de 2008.
 Indic: 100%
 A totalidade dos municípios tiveram um aumento do numero de prestações de contas conforme a LRF, apesar
 que no momento da finalização do PDRS, cerca de 72% dos municípios das regiões do PDRS (total de 67
 municípios) cumpriram a Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal, sendo 72% no Bico do Papagaio, 88% no Jalapão,
 79% na região Nordeste e 60% no sudeste. Na região do Bico do Papagaio os municípios de Araguatins, Praia
 Norte, São Sebastião do Tocantins, Axixá do Tocantins, São Bento do Tocantins e São Miguel não cumpriram
 o Art. 55,§2º. da LRF e o município de Esperantina não cumpriu os artigos 19, III; 20, III “a? e “b? da LRF;
 Na região Nordeste os municípios de Wanderlândia e Palmeirante não cumpriram o Art. 55,§2º. da LRF e
 Campos Lindos não cumpriu os artigos Art. 55,§2º. e 19, III; 20, III “a? e “b? da LRF; na região do Jalapão o
 município de Lizarda não cumpriu o Art. 55,§2º. da LRF e na região sudeste os municípios de Lavandeira,
 Taipas do Tocantins, Aurora do Tocantins, Conceição do Tocantins, Chapada de Natividade, Ponte Alta do
 Bom Jesus, São Valério de Natividade e Taguatinga não cumpriram o Art. 55,§2º. da LRF. O Artigo 55, § 2º.
 da LRF refere-se ao RELATÓRIO DE GESTÃO FISCAL – RGF, que deverá ser elaborado e publicado
 pelo Prefeito Municipal e Presidente da Câmara, a cada quatro meses, de forma padronizada, conforme
 modelo determinado pela Secretaria do Tesouro Nacional – STN, e será publicado até 30 dias após o
 encerramento do período a que corresponder. Os municípios com população inferior a 50.000 habitantes
 poderão elaborar e publicar o RGF a cada 6 (seis) meses, conforme art. 63, III, desde que façam opção em ato
 próprio. (Art. 54 e 55 da LRF). IMPORTANTE: O descumprimento do prazo da publicidade do RGF, pelo
 Executivo ou Legislativo, sujeita o município a não receber transferências voluntárias e não contratar
 operações de crédito, bem como, às sanções previstas na Lei dos Crimes Fiscais. Os artigos 19, III; 20, III “a?
 e “b? da LRF referem-se a GASTOS COM PESSOAL - Na LRF, há limites de gastos com pessoal, como
 percentual das receitas, para os três Poderes da União, dos Estados, do Distrito Federal e dos Municípios,
 assim distribuídos: Nos Municípios, os limites máximos para gastos com pessoal (60% da Receita Corrente
 Líquida) serão:
 - 6% para o Legislativo;
 - 54% para o Executivo
 Se o governante verificar que ultrapassou os limites para despesa de pessoal, deverá tomar providências para
 se enquadrar, no prazo de oito meses. Mas, se depois disso, continuarem a existir excessos, ele sofrerá
 penalidades.

 INDICADOR: Sistema de planejamento estadual fortalecido ao final de 2008.
 Indic: Sim
 O Projeto contribuiu para esta melhoria ao suprir apoio específico de consultores,por exemplo,para definir o
 PPA e Estratégia do Estado, e um número de treinamentos de pessoal para monitoramento & avaliação e
 administração pública.

Macrocomponente: Gerenciamento ambiental do Estado
 INDICADOR: Número de zoneamentos regionais prontos: 3 até o fim 2005; 6 até o fim de 2008.
 Indic: 4
 O objetivo foi parcialmente alcançado, tendo em vista que:
 (i) embora tenha havido uma discordância no início quanto à abordagem conceitual, houve significativos
 avanços quanto à estratégia de abordagem, que resultou na elaboração de um novo Termo de Referencia;
 (ii) a evolução conceitual confluiu em uma execução integral para todo o território tocantinense, em vez de
 vários trabalhos locais menores, assim foram executados dois grandes estudos que geraram três ferramentas
 para ordenamento territorial do Tocantins – 1 - Estudo da Dinâmica da Cobertura e Uso da Terra, 2 -
 Mapeamento das Regiões Fitoecológicas e Inventário Florestal; 3 – Plano de Uso da Vegetação.
 Assim sendo, foi conduzido um total de 4 zoneamentos locais/instrumentos.

 INDICADOR: Número de áreas protegidas a ser estabelecida até o fim 2008: 6.
 Indic: 0 (18 com 90% concluída)
 O objetivo foi parcialmente alcançado, tendo em vista que pela primeira vez, foi possível identificar as áreas
 prioritárias para conservação da biodiversidade no Estado, avaliar os condicionantes socioeconômicos e as

                                                    50
 tendências atuais da ocupação humana do território tocantinense, bem como formular as ações mais
 importantes para conservação dos nossos recursos naturais. No final do trabalho, foram escolhidas 18 áreas
 superando as metas inicialmente previstas. Considerando que se chegou a um estágio avançado no processo de
 estabelecimento de Unidades de Conservação, ou seja, mais de 90% do processo foi realizado, uma vez que a
 etapa subseqüente dependerá apenas de consultas públicas e da edição de Lei específica.

 INDICADOR: Ferramentas de gerenciamento do uso da terra aprovadas e em uso até o fim de 2008.
 Indic: 100%
 O objetivo foi alcançado, pois a discussão dos ´instrumentos operacionais´ imagens de satélite evoluiu para a
 execução dos serviços técnicos especializados de: (i) Estudo da Dinâmica da Cobertura e Uso da Terra, bem
 como de (ii) Mapeamento das Regiões Fitoecológicas e Inventário Florestal do Estado do Tocantins. Ressalta-
 se que os produtos de tais trabalhos serviram como instrumento das políticas de planejamento de uso e
 conservação das terras do Estado do Tocantins, considerando-se tanto as práticas produtivas quanto as ações
 de licenciamento conduzidas pelo Naturatins.

Macrocomponente: Melhoramento e conservação de rodovias estaduais e municipais
 INDICADOR: Eliminação de 85% dos pontos críticos das principais redes de estradas municipais até o fim
 de 2008.
 Indic: 95%
 A utilização deste indicador foi bastante apropriada, pois através dele foi possível acompanhar o andamento
 das obras e verificar sua execução real, podendo ser atendidos próximo de 5000 pontos críticos.

 INDICADOR: Tráfego de conexão a rodovias melhoradas e aumentadas em 15% até o fim de 2008.
 Indic: 200% (15% ao ano)
 Este incremento deve-se ao fato do aumento da frota do Estado em virtude do crescimento da população e da
 melhoria da malha rodoviária Estadual e principalmente municipal a partir da implementação do PDRS.

 INDICADOR: Melhoria em 120 km de conexão de rodovias e aumentado em 15% até o fim de 2008.
 Indic: 143km
 Ao total foram atendidos 143 Km de rodovias com eliminação de pontos críticos e reabilitação. Os trechos
 beneficiados foram Dianópolis/Conceição do Tocantins e Palmas-Paraíso do Tocantins.

 INDICADOR: Fortalecimento da capacidade de planejamento, operação e monitoramento do DERTINS até
 o fim de 2007.
 Indic: 100%
 A malha estadual (pavimentada e não-pavimentada) foi inteiramente georeferrenciada, e o órgão mantém e
 atualiza por meios próprios esse banco de dados.
 O sistema de conhecimento de tráfego (volume médio diário de veículos, por tipo de veículo) 100%
 implantado. O sistema também é mantido pelos próprios funcionários.
 Foram feitos 2 exercícios de avaliação da condição dos pavimentos para toda malha pavimentada estadual,
 com plena participação de funcionários das áreas técnica e de conserva.
 Treinados mais de 200 funcionários em diversos temas técnicos e gerenciais, segundo sete categorias
 (Administrativa e Financeira, Construção e Manutenção de Rodovias, Georreferenciamento, Meio
 Ambiente, Operação e Segurança, Planejamento rodoviário e Informática). Um subproduto positivo não
 previsto originalmente foi o elevado grau de satisfação demonstrado pela maior parte dos(as) treinandos(as)
 em termos de percepção de sua valorização.

 INDICADOR: Assinatura de 2 contratos piloto de manutenção de estradas estadual (1000km) e municipal
 (1000km) até o fim de 2006.
 Indic: 0
 O valor do componente foi estimado no PAD em US$ 4,6 milhões. Os contratos-piloto para as estradas
 municipais (vicinais, não pavimentadas) foram excluídos após exame dos prós e contras. O principal fator
 (contra) foi a vulnerabilidade dessas vicinais aos fatores climáticos adversos e aleatórios, e a tendência do
 setor privado em embutir tais riscos nos seus preços propostos. O valor de US$ 4,6 milhões, após exercícios
 de simulação efetuados, seria suficiente para menos de 1.000 km nos quais constassem serviços de restauração
 + 3 anos de conserva. Uma rodovia prioritária, e já em estágio de degradação acelerada em alguns segmentos

                                                   51
 foi selecionada (TO-080, Palmas - Paraíso, de 53 km). Dado o limite dos recursos somente o projeto de
 restauração foi contratado. A implantação dessa restauração foi contratado e finalizado.

 Conclusão
O Projeto de Desenvolvimento Regional Sustentável permitiu a introdução de melhorias significativas em
três pilares fundamentais no desenvolvimento do Tocantins: planejamento e gestão do desenvolvimento
regional e local, gerenciamento do sistema de proteção ambiental e gestão territorial e na conservação de
rodovias estaduais e municipais.
A promoção do planejamento e da gestão regional dos programas públicos utilizando critérios técnicos,
econômicos e ambientais, bem como o aumento da participação das comunidades fortaleceram: (i) os
projetos existentes, com a implantação de quatro conselhos de desenvolvimento regional (Conder) e fóruns
locais; (ii) a capacidade gerencial das prefeituras com assistência técnica, capacitação e informação através
da criação de quatro unidades técnicas regionais (UTR).
Outro aspecto relevante a ser destacado foi o aumento dos municípios que melhoraram sua prestação de
contas e transparência e hoje atendem à Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal (LRF), alcançando o índice de 72%
na data de 31 de Outubro de 2011.
No caso do PDRS, os indicadores não conseguiram representar os avanços significativos obtidos nas áreas
de meio ambiente, recursos hídricos e irrigação: os estudos estratégicos elaborados, que ampliaram o
acervo técnico existente, vão de instrumentos de planejamento, como os Planos de Recursos Hídricos, o
Plano Diretor de Irrigação e os Programas Ambientais de Conservação e uso Sustentável da Biodiversidade,
a estudos técnicos específicos sobre águas subterrâneas e adensamento da rede hidrometeorológica
estadual; e, de forma incontestável, as conquistas na capacitação das equipes, na mobilização da sociedade
e no fortalecimento das instituições envolvidas.
Pela primeira vez, foi possível identificar as áreas prioritárias para conservação da biodiversidade no
Estado, avaliar os condicionantes socioeconômicos e as tendências atuais da ocupação humana do território
tocantinense, bem como formular as ações mais importantes para conservação dos nossos recursos naturais.
No final do trabalho, foram escolhidas 18 áreas.
Foi possível também a construção de políticas públicas ambientais e de apoio ao desenvolvimento
sustentável, como a de proteção a fauna, de pesca e de irrigação, assim como para implementação dos
instrumentos de gerenciamento, notadamente a outorga de direito de uso dos recursos hídricos. Diversas
ações, implementadas com recursos financeiros do Banco, impulsionaram a mobilização social para
formação de organismos de bacias hidrográficas, como encontros de capacitação e treinamento.

Os resultados obtidos no Componente de Melhoramento e Conservação de Rodovias, facilitaram
consideravelmente os acessos às áreas produtivas nas regiões do Projeto (Bico do Papagaio, Nordeste,
Jalapão e Sudeste – as mais pobres do Estado, menor IDH). Elas integraram essas áreas com o sistema
rodoviário principal, melhoraram a competitividade dos seus produtos, e a acessibilidade de suas
populações. Na dimensão institucional, o projeto contemplou um leque de ações voltadas a modernizar a
gestão do órgão rodoviário do Estado.

O Tocantins classifica como totalmente satisfatório os resultados obtidos pelo PDRS e a parceria
estabelecida com o Banco Mundial para o desenvolvimento Estado.
