Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
The project supports the Ugandan National Action Plan for Children and the National Poverty Eradication Strategy. The development
objective is to improve growth and development of children under six years of age, in terms of nutrition, health, psycho-social and
cognitive aspects. These dimensions of child growth and development are described in the project's conceptual framework in Figure I
below. At the end of the five-year implementation period, the project will be evaluated based on the following indicators: (a) reduced
prevalence of underweight preschool children by one-third of the 1995 levels in the project districts; (b) improved children's psycho-
social and cognitive development; (c) formation of at least one women's savings and credit group in each community where the
project will be implemented.
.............. ............... ............................................. .............................................................................................................................................. ...................................
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
The project supports the government's program to enhance the capacity of households and communities to take care of preschool age
children (0 to 6 years) through the provision of knowledge on child growth and development, parenting, nutrition and health care, and
income generating capacity for women, implemented at grassroots level.

3. Benefits and target population:
Economic benefits
.   Improved preschool child nutrition, health and psycho-social stimulation will improve the receptiveness to education at the
primary level. This translates into reduced repetition and drop-out rates at lower primary level.
.   Improved primary schooling efficiency will result in increased fiscal savings, and increased financial savings on the part of
parents who pay for primary schooling expenses including materials, transportation and uniforms/clothing for schooling.
* Improved nutrition, health and cognitive development for children reached by the program will increase lifetime earnings.
. Improved nutrition of young children will reduce future morbidity resulting from strong interactions between nutritional well
being and good health. This is expected to lower the future costs to the health care system resulting from these preventative
measures.
. Increased income to the parents/mothers who will participate in the savings and income group formation activities. These
entrepreneurial activities will produce secondary benefits which would increase total rural output. Increased incomes of women
will improve child nutrition and health.
Social benefits
•   Young children, mothers, and women's groups will be among the main beneficiaries of the project. The enhanced parenting
skills and the participation of women in the income generating activities will generate substantial social benefits from a better
quality of life for women, children and families.
*   Large scale investments in early childhood development would greatly enhance school readiness, thus increase the chances of
reaching the goal of universal primary education, which is one of the main priorities of the government.
*   Child care arrangements that provide safe environments for preschoolers during the day allow mothers to join the workforce,
which would benefit all members of the family.
*   The project would alos reach families who are fostering orphaned children and assist them in improving child caring practices.
The DHS (1995) survey indicates that one in four households in Uganda is fostering at least one orphan, whose parents died
mostly of AIDS.
.   In summary, these programs that would remedy critical early childhood deficiencies are fundamental to success of each child in
life, and the society as a whole. These are central to the strategy for poverty reduction.

Targetpopulation: Children under six years of age and their parents, with particular emphasis on mothers and caregivers. The credit
will finance programs in 25 out of 45 districts in the country, with implementation phased over a 5-year period.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements (Details are included in the Project Implementation Manual).
Implementation period: Five years.
Executing agency:     Ministry of Planning and Economic Development
Project implenentation: Given the nature of activities, this project will be implemented at the grassroots level by small community
based organizations, including womens' groups, savings groups and parents' groups. These organizations will be supported by NGOs
who will be contracted to provide technical assistance and capacity building. The Project Implementation Manual spells out the
guidelines that will be adapted to community planning and implementation. Implementation of the component on National Program
Support will be coordinated through the Ministry of Education and Sports, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Gender and
Community Development.
Project coordination:  At the national level, a Project Coordinating Office (PCO), within the Social Services Section of the
Ministry of Planning and Economic Development (MOPED), and accountable to the Permanent Secretary, will be responsible for
coordinating and supervising the activities of the project. The PCO will be small, consisting of a Project Coordinator (PC), a Deputy
Project Coordinator, and a qualified accountant. The PCO will contract out to private management/accounting firms or NGOs such
tasks as: monitoring and evaluation, accounting and management audit, procurement, training and technical assistance to district level
NGOs and other tasks related to implementation. The PC will ensure that program activities at the operational levels in the district,
sub-county, parish and community are carried out; and prepare periodic reports on implementation. All district level activities will be
coordinated and supervised at the district level by District Coordination Committees (DCC).
Project oversight andpolicy guidance: This will be the responsibility of an interministerial Project Steering Committee (PSC) to be
established, under the Chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Planning and Economic Development. The PSC, will
provide overall guidance on policy matters and make recommendations on improving quality of project implementation. The PSC
will include Permanent Secretaries or representatives from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and Sports, Ministry of
Gender and Community Development, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Local Governments, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal
Industries and Fisheries, Ministry of Information, and representatives of the National Council for Children (NCC), and the NGO
forum. A Project Management Advisory Committee (PMAC) consisting of technical experts in nutrition, early childhood
development, community planning and development, and finance will provide technical advise to the PCO as needed.
Planning, accounting,financial reporting, andauditing arrangements. The Implementation arrangements and processes are
outlined in an implementation manual prepared by the Government in consultation with the Bank. Since not all the 25 project
districts will have the necessary implementation conditions to receive program inputs, the project will be phased into those districts
that are declared by the government as "ready" based on eligibility criteria for readiness. This demand driven design would help
accelerate the implementation process. The project will provide technical assistance to districts, to enable them to gain early eligibility
in the program. An annual planning and budgeting process will be critical to the effective implementation of the project and is
detailed in the Project Implementation Manual. Each year, the community organizations, with assistance from the contracted NGOs,
will prepare Annual Work Plans and Funding Requests. NGOs will assist the district level authorities to consolidate the plans for
project activities of the entire district, and all district plans would be consolidated into a project Annual Work Plan by the Project
Coordination Office. Expenditures will then be incurred mostly by NGOs in accordance with the approved plans and funding
requirements. NGOs would be accountable to the DCC and will be required to maintain and help assist the community organizations
to maintain accounts in accordance with the implementation manual. In addition to the auditing of all project accounts, management
audits would be conducted of expenditures incurred by community organizations by an independently hired firm or NGO.
Project monitoring and evaluation and reporting arrangements. A detailed Monitoring and Evaluation system has been developed
as part of the Project Implementation Manual. With the guidance from the Project Coordinator, the project M&E will be a shared
responsibility of the PCO and the District Development Committee. A monitoring system which will be computerized, will inform the
management and policy makers on the progress of activities and impact on the ground. The M&E will be guided by the project
logical framework given in Annex I that spells out the relevant process and outcome indicators of the project. The project M&E will
be conducted through the following activities: (a) regular quarterly meetings of the PSC chaired by the Permnanent Secretary of
MOPED; (b) IDA supervision missions; (c) annual progress review by IDA; (d) mid-term review of the project conducted jointly
with other donors no later than 30 months after effectiveness; (e) baseline and repeat surveys of beneficiaries; (f) quarterly progress
reports based on the implementation milestones defined by the Annual Work Plan and Budget. The PC will submit to IDA a report on
progress of implementation and outcomes, to be received twice a year--one on July 31 and another on January 31. A project
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be prepared within six months of the credit closing.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project    (CAS: Report No. 16540 Board Date May 20, 1997)
The central focus of the Uganda Country Assistance Stragety (CAS) is poverty reduction through economic growth, improved social
services and targeted intervention in the North. As a community based program that provides early childhood development services
and which increases women's incomes, the proposed operation directly supports the CAS objectives. The project strategy involves
building capacity of parents, of communities, and local councils to improve children's nutrition, health, cognitive development and
school performance which would ultimately improve human capital, essential for sustained economic growth.
n sector issues and Government strategy:
Despite Uganda's rapid economic growth in the last four years, social indicators such as malnutrition amongst children have remained
high. The most recent Demographic and Health Survey of 1995 indicates that 38% of children below six years are stunted; infant
mortality rates at 97 per 1000, remained higher than Sub-Saharan average. Despite Uganda's agricultural endowments, malnutrition
rate remains very high, and in fact is amongst the highest in Africa. The main causes have been identified: frequent illnesses amongst
the very young, poor child feeding and weaning practices, and poor quality of child care. There is lack of knowledge amongst mothers
and caregivers on proper food preparation, and appropriateness and timing of weaning foods. Much more serious is the overall lack of
resources to sustain the family's ability to take care of children.
Government Strategy
Through its policies, the Ugandan Government fully subscribes to the economic rationale for investing in children in the early years.
These are reflected in the goals of the Uganda National Action Plan for Children (1993-2003). This Plan commits to a national
investment plan for children's health and nutrition, water and sanitation, basic education and child protection. Parliament enacted the
Children's Statute of 1996 which provides a legal framework for the protection of children's rights as well as their obligations to
society. About 30 out of the 45 districts in the country have developed District Plans of Action for Children, which provide the
guiding framework for the activities on child development and child protection. The govemment strategy in this sector is very clear:
promotion of health, nutrition and psycho-social stimulation at infancy and early childhood will improve the chances of these children
to perform well at primary school, thereby increasing their chances to complete school and become productive members of the labor
force.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project is designed to support the Uganda National Action Plan for Children. It will also contribute to the achievement of the
goals of the National Poverty Eradication Strategy since activities for caring of children in communities will also target the same
parents in tenns of skills for income generation. The program is expected to significantly contribute towards the achievement of the
goal of universal primary education (UPE) by preparing the next cohort of primary school children.
Strategic choices
In devising a strategy for the project, the main choices were between direct provision of the child development services or the
capacity enhancement of communities, parents groups and women's groups to address child development. After conducting three
broad based consultations with the major stakeholders (donors, parents groups, local governments, and central government officials),
the consensus that emerged was that community/parent groups capacity building should comprise the bulk of program interventions.
This would ensure that project objectives are addressed in a sustainable manner. More than 80% of all resources for the project are
directed at enhancing the capacity of these groups to address the needs of children. Delivery of actual services are all to be handled at
the community level (LCI level) and are organized mainly by community organizations, facilitated by project-contracted NGOs.
A second strategic choice, involved the geographic coverage of the project. The Government is proposing to eventually cover all
districts. The project under this credit will be appraised as the first phase of a long-term national program, whose lessons will be
incorporated and extended in the next phase to other districts to ensure satisfactory outcome. The first phase financed by this credit
will cover 25 (out of 45) districts identified by the Government.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection;
Integrated Community Child Care Package. Alternatives rejected:
*   Food supplementation to support children and families with severe problems of malnutrition. Rejected because the logistics
of food distribution are costly and not sustainable. More importantly, research in Uganda has shown that increase in
consumption of calories in fact is less cost effective compared to improvements in morbidity situation in young children.
Generattion of knowledge on child care practices is more sustainable.
*   Direct project provision of child development services. Rejected because it fosters dependency on public supply of services.

Alternative selected: Menu of essential services are offered to communities, who would define actual services through community
planning. This process will be facilitated and supervised through NGOs who will be contracted to serve the technical support
functions. Responsibility for the choice of child development services rests on communities and will be supported by training,
capacity building and financial support grants. The process is decentralized at the community level.
Savings and Credit Group Formation to Support Child Care. Alternative rejected:
* Provision of credit (on-lending) to women's groups. Rejected because experience in Uganda shows that direct credit at
concessional rates have failed. Furthermore, studies indicate that the lack of credit per se is not the constraint to microenterprise
development.
Alternative selected: Formation of women's savings groups formed around the same parental/women's groups in the parental
education activities. This involves grassroots management training and capacity building for microenterprise development which have
been found to succeed in many communities in Africa and elsewhere. These savings groups will be encouraged to access existing
credit facilities as appropriate.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Lesson 1 (see PAPSCA ICR): The participation of key stakeholders, particularly beneficiaries, increases project ownership and
success and chances of sustainability. Reflecting on this lesson, the project was prepared in a participatory manner through the
creation of a project task force, conduct of client consultation workshops and participatory rural assessments. Three national client
consultation workshops attended by key stakeholders (6 central ministries, district governments, parents groups, academia, NGOs, 5
donor agencies) were held to define the project objectives and strategies. Implementation at the community level will follow a
bottom-up approach where communities will be involved in the planning process.
Lesson 2 (see PAPSCA ICR). A Project Implementation Manual establishing a clear framework for the project implementation is
crucial. Reflecting on this lesson, submission of a draft Project Implementation Manual satisfactory to IDA, is a condition for project
appraisal.
Lesson 3 (see PAPSCA ICR). NGOs that will support project implementation must be selected through a competitive process with
predetermined selection criteria. Reflecting on this lesson, the selection criteria were defined and agreed at pre-appraisal .
Lesson 4 (see PAPSCA ICR). Projects with decentralized implementation arrangements need suitable project management structures
and implementation arrangements. Reflecting on this lesson, the project is designed within the government's decentralized
framework. Procurement and disbursement of funds are designed to ensure that they suit community involvement.
Lesson 5 (see PAPSCA ICR). Projects need built-in monitoring and evaluation systems, to assess and respond to the views of critical
stakeholders. Reflecting on this lesson, a monitoring and evaluation system has been designed.
ndications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Government has committed to implement its 1 0-year program called the Uganda National Plan of Action for Children (UNPAC),
and declared national priority for child survival and development. In 1996, the Ugandan Parliament enacted into law a Children's
Statute which provides a legal framework for the protection of the rights of children as well as their obligation to society. The
national government has included this project in the Public Investment Programme (Strategic Areas) and in the budget for FY97-
2000, as a commitment to the preparation and implementation of the Nutrition and Early Childhood Development Programme. In its
presentation of programs and policies to the CG Meeting in Paris in November 1996, the government explicitly declared that
investments in children through this project is amongst its major policies addressing poverty in the coming years.
During preparation, the government established a Project Preparation Team (PPT) coordinated by three full time professionals who
conducted consultation workshops, surveys, and coordination with district governments. The PPT prepared the Government Proposal
for this project which was agreed by stakeholders through participatory planning workshops. Even before Board presentation, the
Government appointed a full time Project Coordinator and has began the process of selecting NGOs who will be involved in project
implementation.

12. Value added of Bank support:
The preparation of the project benefited from several Bank instruments including: the Country Assistance Strategy Paper, the Country
Economic Memorandum/Poverty Update, and the Policy Framework Paper. The CAS and the Poverty Update identified several key
contributions of the project in the overall strategy for addressing poverty in the next five years. These instruments also guaranteed
that the project is consistent with the short and medium term fiscal framework, and that the program is fiscally sustainable.

Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment (see Annex 4)    Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$ 23.6-million; ERR= 18.5%
The project has clear justification on equity grounds since ECD programs are likely to be more beneficial to the poorest children.
Furthermore, there is a market failure due to inadequate information on the part of parents concerning their children's nutritional
and developmental needs. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted to determine the economic feasibility of the project. Benefits
calculated include: (a) benefits to children in terms of the incremental lifetime earnings, improved primary school performance
measured by lower drop-out and repetition which contribute to financial savings to parents; (b) benefits to parents in terms of
incremental earnings as a result of the training on income generating activities. A number of other economic benefits cannot be
monetized and thus excluded from the calculations, such as lower lifetime health costs to individuals and society from reduction
in morbidity as a result of the preventive health and nutrition measures, and fiscal savings from lower health care and school
costs. In calculating the benefits, only those attributable to the project are included. Clearly, other programs like those in health
and agricultural sector would contribute to better nutrition and child development.
. The economic costs include the project investment costs and the recurrent costs.
*   The project's economic rate of return is calculated at 18.5% and a net present value (NPV) of US$23.6-million using a 12%
discount rate. A sensitivity analysis showed that the risk of the project having a negative NPV is negligible.
*   The impact on government fnance is positive. The savings arising from the reduction in wastage in the primary school system,
lower health care costs, and future increments in taxes from increased earnings are expected to be larger in present value terms
than the fiscal costs.
~~~~~~~~~........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)
*   Incremental recurrent costs of the project fnanced by the government would average $800,000 per year from 1999 to 2003. This
will be offset later by large recurrent cost savings arising from improvements in efficiency in the primary school system from
lower repetition, and lower health costs of the health system from projected lower morbidity rates. Government financing at the
investment phase is sufficiently small.
.   The present value in fnancial terms that would accrue to the cohort of children due to increased incomes as adults, and to parents
who will participate in the income generating activities in the project is estimated at $ 19-million. This accounts for most of the
financial benefits to the project. Other financial benefits would accrue to the parents of these children who will likely spend less
on education arising from reduced grade repetition and lower health care costs due to lower morbidity.
15. Technical Assessment:
The project is based on a technically sound design, aspects of which have been piloted in two districts in the country. Targeting of
districts to be covered by the program is based on systematic assessment of needs (high infant mortality, low enrollment, high
malnutrition). However, phasing of implementation would depend on the "readiness"of districts to receive program inputs. Basic
conditions of eligibility to receive inputs need to be satisfied. Components were designed on the basis of local needs assessments and
demand analysis combined with experience and international best practice in parental education, nutrition and growth monitoring,
and microenterprise development. Combining parental/caregiver education activity with microenterprise development is an
innovation that has worked in Ugandan schemes in programs that support orphans and in similar programs in other countries. It is
meant to reinforce the perceived need to enhance parents knowledge about care of children concurrent with the enhancement of their
income-earning skills. Additional skills for income-generation for women are designed to sustain the interest of project participants.
The inclusion of these features were found to generate interest especially of the mothers. The use of NGOs as the technical supervisors
of the community based activities is an innovation of the project. The use of community support grants is meant to offer decentralized
decision making at the community level. Since the project relies on behavioral change as a vehicle, IEC strategy has been developed.
Unit costs used in the estimates are based on prevailing market unit costs, and allow for inflation and reasonable level of physical
contingencies.

Executing Agencies: The project includes measures to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Planning and Economic
Development in areas of planning, coordination and monitoring and evaluation.
Project Management. The Ministry of Planning and Economic Development has experience in coordinating donor-funded projects.
Currently, it is the overseer of the implementation of UNICEF's Five-Year Program. A small professional team within the ministry

ministry structure, and not an outside and independent implementing unit. At the district level, the structures within the
decentralization policy framework will be used. The contracted NGOs will provide the main technical assistance and support for the
project activities at the community level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
17. Social Assessment:
Preventative health care and nutrition programs are more difficult to implement because most of these interventions are designed to
influence behavior. Incentives to parents and mothers to participate shoald be clear. Weighing of children and regular attendance in
the parental education activities could impose a substantial time burden on these participants. For this reason, a careful analysis of the
design options was done by the government's project preparation team . Social assessments, needs analysis and district consultations
were carried out during the preparation period. The most important finding from these social assessments is the persistent demand for
income generating activities to support these mothers. Thus, there is need to provide them with means to improve family resources,
and not only with child caring knowledge. The project design chosen includes these income generating aspects which are, in
themselves, compatible with the parental education activities, since the savings groups and microenterprise training are formed around
the same parents and women who will participate in the parental education and nutrition monitoring activities.

The government adopted a participatory process in the development of the project. At the initial stages, a stakeholder analysis was
carried out to determnine the key stakeholders of the proposed program. This was followed by three national client consultation
workshops, each of which had attendance from at least 60 representatives from the project stakeholders--government ministries,
donors, NGOs, district officials, academia, private sector, and parents groups. In addition, four separate needs assessments using
participatory rural appraisals were conducted, the results of which were presented at the participatory client consultation workshops.
District assessments of child care needs were carried out in sample communities in rural and urban areas. Since NGOs will be
involved in the project, extensive consultations with various NGO groups were held throughout the preparation period. Several
divergent views were expressed by some NGOs on the project approach. The project design reflects the consensus of groups who
were consulted.

20. Sustainability:
The present credit will finance the first phase of a long-term national program. The following features are adopted in the project
design to promote sustainability: (a) a demand-driven, community-based and bottom up approach in defining child development
activities which would create wider community ownership of the program; (b) capacity building at the district in planning and
monitoring of community child development activities; (c) building of grassroots institutions (savings groups) around the parents'
groups who would receive the parental education; (d) requirements for counterpart community contributions thus promoting
community ownership of the programs. The core of the project activities is the promotion of good child care behaviors to support
child development in families of communities to maintain such behaviors. A substantial part of the project is devoted to capacity
building , training and development communications to promote child growth and development, and the creation of grassroots
institutions (such as the savings groups formed around parents/mothers groups) which are expected to continue after the project
investment period. The project is sustainable from the fiscal point of view. The incremental recurrent costs during the operational
period is expected to be around $2.1 million which will be incurred by district governments and communities for early childhood
development.

Mr. James W. Adams
Country Director for Uganda
The World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W
Washington, D.C
20433, USA
Dear Mr. Adams,
NUTRITION AND EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LETTER OF SECTORAL POLICY
iNTRODUCTION
1. The Government of Uganda hereby submits a request for a World Bank (IDA)
Credit to facilitate the implementation of a Nutrition and Early Childhood
Development (NECD) Project, whose overall objective is to improve the health,
nutrition, psycho-social and cognitive status of children under 6 years of age in
Uganda. The main project strategy is to enhance the capacity of parents and
communities to take better care of pre-school age children through enhancing
knowledge on parenting, nutrition and health care, and income generating
activities for women. The policy framework for Early Childhood Development
under which the project has been developed is outlined- in the paragraphs that
follow:
GENERAL POLICY FRAMEWORK
2. The Government realizes that giving children a healthy start is one of the major
strategies that will eventually lead to improvements in their quality of life and that
of the general population. Improvements in child welfare lead to improvement in
human capital which is a necessary pre-requisite for sustainable development. As
a strategic plan to guide policies and resource allocation to meet children's health
and developmental needs, the Government adopted in 1992 the Uganda National
Plan of Action for Children (UNPAC). The plan foresees the provision of basic
social services in health, nutrition, and education to as many Ugandan children as
possible. UNPAC was followed by the establishment of the National Council for
Children (NCC) in 1993. The NCC mandate is child advocacy, and coordination
and mobilization of resources for effective implementation of the UNPAC.

3. The NECD project is a direct input in achieving the objectives of the UTNPAC
since successful child development can be best achieved through the provision of
integrated services that address at the same time the social, emotional, cognitive,
health, and nutrition needs of children.
4. The NECD project will be implemented in the context of the following social
sector policies:
4.1. The Poverty Eradication Strategy and Plan of Action which implements a
two-pronged strategy of poverty eradication consisting of measures to
increase incomes of poor, and measures to improve the quality of life of the
poor through provision of basic social services. The NECD project is an
important input into the poverty eradication and human capital development
strategies. Besides increasing awareness on effective resource management
at the household level, the project will raise incomes among families and
communities through its training on savings, credit and income generation.
4.2 The National Food and Nutrition Policy (NFNP) which addresses food and
nutrition as a major national resource for human development and economic
growth, and as part of the political advocacy for a sustainable macro
economic policy. The objectives of this policy to be implemented under the
NECD project include reduction of protein energy malnutrition; promotion of
breast-feeding and appropriate weaning foods; promotion of good child
feeding practices using locally available foods; improvement in maternal
nutrition status; reduction of the incidence of low birth weight; and control of
Vitamin A, Iodine and Iron deficiencies. The above activities will take place
within the framework of improved food security at the household level which
the project aims to improve through financial and technical support to
households.
4.3 The National Education Policy which is geared towards improving
accessibility, equity, quality and relevance of education with special focus on
universalization of primary education. The Government recognizes that
improvements in early childhood development on a large scale will also
greatly enhance school readiness, thus increasing the chances of reaching the
goal of universal primary education, which is one of the Government's main
priorities. Under the new pre-school education policy, government support
include care-giver/teacher training; curriculum and materials development;
community mobilization; and registration, regulation and inspection of public
and privately run facilities. The Government underscores the importance of
partnership between parents, communities, non-government organizations
(NGOs), public and private agencies, and bilateral donors in the provision of
pre-school education.
4.4 The National Health Policy which is centered on primary health care (PHC)
approach and accords priority in resource allocation to preventive services
with emphasis on community participation and, involvement in improving
their own health. In line with this policy, the NECD project will build the
kncwledge and skills of parents and communities to provide proper health

The NECD project will establish effective links between communities and the
various service providers thereby utilizing the existing basic service
infrastructure in the delivery of health and other social services.
4.5 The National Decentralization Policy and Framework which aims at the
devolution of responsibility to districts, sub-counties and communities as a
means of improving performance, financial transparency and accountability,
effectiveness and sustainability.  Under the policy, the private sector,
including non-government organizations and communities themselves, is
playing an increasing role in the provision of social services.  The
implementation of the NECD project will be guided by the Decentralization
Policy and Framework.
5. In implementing the above poverty reduction and social sector policies and
translating them into programmes, government has received support from several
development partners, including UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, World Bank, WHO,
EFAD, DANIDA, CIDA, USAID, ODA, NORAD, GTZ, SCF (UK), EU and other
multilateral and bilateral agencies.
SUBSECTORAL POLICIES TO BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE
PROJECT TIME
6. Specific subsectoral policies to be implemented within the project time include the
following:
i  Build the knowledge and skills of parents and communities to provide proper
health education and care, appropriate child nutrition, and adequate early
childhood development;
=  Increase the availability of ECD services through community support grant,
innovation fund, and community capacity building;
*  Support micro-nutrient control program;
*  Support early education;
*  Increase awareness of children's rights and needs;
*  Improve collaboration between government and non-government entities
(including NGOs and CBOs), and communities on provision of ECD
programs.
Build the knowledge and skills of parents and communities
6.1 The NECD project will mobilize groups of mothers (and parents) at the
community level, supported by project materials in local languages, technical
supervision and communications. Under this activity, parents and child caregivers
will be trained on the rights and needs of children, including their health, nutrition and
psycho-social needs.  Training will also be provided on mobilizing resources,

improving savings and identifying viable income generating activities that would
increase the resource base at the household level for better child care.
Increase availability of ECD services
6.2 Through the NECD project, community support grants will be offered on the
basis of matching contributions from communities. These grants and contributions
from communities will cover activities designed to provide child care and early
education facilities which fall within the project's guidelines. To qualify for this
grant, communities will provide counterpart contributions which may be in the form
of goods, works or services. Examples of the uses of such grants are construction and
operation of community child care centers, home based child care centers, or the
production and marketing of weaning foods. An innovation fund will also be
available at the sub-county level to address child related problems outside those
supported by the community grant. The objective of the innovation fund is to
increase the resource base for communities, and to increase the capacity of sub-
counties to respond to child related problems. Unlike the community grant, no
specific menu of options is pre-determined for the innovation fund. Communities will
be directly involved in selecting, planning and implementing interventions that they
perceive to be of utmost priority to them. This strategy aims at creating community
ownership and enhancing sustainability of the interventions initiated by the project
and other sources of support.
Support micro-nutrient control program
6.3 The NECD project will support the implementation of specific activities for
dietary prevention of micro-nutrient deficiencies including conducting of advocacy
campaigns, and sensitization and training activities to relevant target groups.
Support early education
6.4 The NECD project will support the Ministry of Education through its National
Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) to develop, test and distribute early
childhood education training manuals. These materials will be used to train ECD
teachers. NCDC will also carry out training of the ECD teachers at national, district
and sub-county levels through a cascading arrangement.  The government will
promote pre-school education under the broadened concept of ECD.
Increase awareness of children's rights and needs
6.5 The NECD project will support sensitization and advocacy activities carried out
by the Ministry of Gender and Community Development and the National Council for
Children (NCC).
Collaboration between government and non-government entities
6.6 Given the nature of the activities, the NECD project will be implemented at the
grassroots levels by local NGOs and community based organizations, including
women's groups, savings groups and parents' groups. These organizations will be

supported by NGOs and other agencies who will be contracted to provide technical
assistance and capacity building. At the district level, a Lead NGO will be selected
through a competitive bidding process, to take responsibility of implementing the
project in the district. The Lead NGO will identify other small NGOs in sub-counties
with which it will work to implement the project at the district level.
PROJECT COORDINATION
7. As a multi-sectoral program involving health, nutrition, early education, child care
and income generation, the initiative will involve linking various government
departments and the non-government entities to provide comprehensive services
towards development of children. The overall coordinating agency is the Ministry of
Planning and Economic Development (MOPED). At national level, the Project.
Steering Committee (PSC), within the MOPED, and accountable to the Permanent
Secretary, will provide strategic and policy guidance and direction of the project. The
composition of the PSC takes into consideration the multiplicity of various key
players in government, the private sector and the donor community.  The key
ministries involved in the implementation will include: Ministry of Health, Ministry
of Education and Sports, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industries and Fisheries,
Ministry of Gender and Community Development and Ministry of Local Government.
A lean but professional national coordination office will oversee the day to day
implementation of the project within the policy framework laid out. A standing
committee with relevance to the district social services and in particular to children
will take charge of coordinating the activities in the district. The project provides
support to the district Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) to monitor and ensure
effective project implementation. Coordination structures similar to those at the
district level will be established at sub-county, parish and community levels within
the decentralization policy framework.
BUDGETARY PROVISIONS
8. The present credit (NECD) will finance the first phase of a long-term national
program. Interventions at this phase will be implemented in 25 districts chosen by the
government based on the level of malnutrition, infant mortality, and rate of primary
school enrollment. The government plan is to eventually cover all districts. Districts
will commit counterpart funding of at least 5% of annual project disbursement or at
least 3% over the previous year's social sector budget. Conditional grants for primary
education and primary health care services are available to districts to ensure that
basic services get substantial resources to meet the real demands of communities. The
Government of Uganda will increase its share of operating costs from 15% in the
second year to 75% during the operational period of the project. The national
government has included this project in the Public Investment Program (Strategic
Areas) and in the budget for FY97-2000, as a commitment to the preparation and
implementation of the NECD programme. In view of the importance the Government
attaches to the NECD Project, Shillings 400,000,000 (Four hundred million) has been
provided in the budget as counterpart funding from Government to support the project
activities during FY 1997/98 . More resources have been allocated to ongoing health,
nutrition and basic education programmes which are expected to supplement the
direct inputs into the project.  In the Poverty and Eradication Plan of Action,
Government is committed to raise the share of basic services in the total recurrent

services in the total recurrent expenditure in the medium term to ensure adequate
funding for sustainable levels of those services.
CONCLUSION
Through the policy implementation and institutional support described above to
promote early childhood development, and by increasing resources at the household
level, improving access to services for better child care and influencing positive child
care and rearing behavior among child care givers, the Government hopes to achieve
the much needed healthy start and improved quality of life for the Ugandan children.
Let me take this opportunity to thank the World Bank for its continued cooperation
and support extended to the Government of Uganda.
Yours sincerely,

Nutrition and Early Childhood Development Project
Detailed Project Description
Project Objectives and Strategy
1.     The development objective of the project is to improve growth and development of children under six years
of age, in terms of nutrition, health, psycho-social and cognitive aspects. The achievement of these objectives at the
end of the five year implementation period will be measured by the following markers: (a) reduced prevalence of
underweight preschool children by one-third of the 1995 levels in the project districts; (b) reduced prevalence of
stunting on entry into primary schools by one-fourth of the 1995 level in the project districts; (c) improved children's
psycho-social and cognitive development; (d) reduced repetition and drop-outs at lower primary school level; (d)
development of entrepreneurship skills and economic empowerment of mothers and caregivers.
2.    The project supports the Ugandan National Plan of Action for Children (1993), and the Poverty Eradication
Strategy (1997). The project particularly enhances school readiness of young children and thus contributes towards
reaching the goal of Universal Primary Education. The main project strategy is to enhance the capacity of families
and communities to take better care of preschool age children (0 to 6 years) through enhancing knowledge on child
growth and development, parenting, nutrition and health care, and income generating activities for women.
Project Approach
3.    The project is a process-driven, locally prioritized program rather than a blue-print package. Program inputs
are phased into communities as a result of a participatory planning process to assure ownership and strengthen
sustainability. Implementation of the program will be through existing structures and on-going programs. The
program will involve collaboration between government and non-government entities (including NGOs and CBOs),
and communities. As a multi-sectoral program involving health, nutrition, early education, child care, and income
generation, the approach will involve linking various government departments and the non-government entities to
provide comprehensive services towards development of children.
Project Components
4.    Project Component 1 - Integrated Community Child Care Package
This component supports the Government's goals (a) to improve parental awareness on major aspects of
child care, growth and development through parental education, child growth monitoring and promotion, training and
sensitization; and (b) to empower communities to support child development programs through capacity building,
through skills for income generation and through support grants. The objective is to reduce malnutrition (low weight
for age) of children by a third at the end of the five-year period in the project districts, and increase readiness of
children for primary schooling and thereby contribute to the drive for Universal Primary Education. Interventions in
this phase will be implemented in 25 districts chosen by the government based on the level of malnutrition, infant
mortality, and rate of primary school enrollment. The government plan is to eventually cover all districts. It includes
interrelated interventions:

Country: Uganda                                                  Project Title: Nutrition and Early Childhood Development
(a) Parental Education. This sub-component will increase parents' and caregivers' understanding of major
aspects of child care, growth and development including child nutrition, health, cognitive and psycho-social
development. A range of related competencies will be strengthened in parents. Building parental skills and
knowledge will in turn improve health, psycho-social development and well-being of children and, ultimately, their
receptiveness to education at the primary level. The program will mobilize groups of mothers (and other caregivers)
at the community level, supported by project materials in local languages, technical supervision and
communications. Simplified learning materials for adults with low literacy have been tested successfully in Uganda.
Over the five year period, the project will cover two-thirds of all communities in 25 project districts. Emphasis will
be on the enhancement of child care practices that promote proper growth and development of children, including:
childhood nutrition and health (exclusive breastfeeding and appropriate weaning practices--particularly the
period of introduction of weaning foods, as well as the type of foods given, and food preparation, child growth
monitoring promotion, and deworming), psycho-social development, cognitive stimulation and social support,
hygiene and improved home health practices. Child Day campaigns will be conducted at the parish level.
(b) Community Capacity Building and Empowerment for Child Care. This subcomponent comprises
two interrelated activities: (i) community capacity building conducted through community planning and
sensitization workshops (ii) training in entrepreneurship to increase incomes of mothers and caregivers. Manuals
have been developed and built around best practice in savings group formation and microenterprise development in
Uganda.
Project Component 2 - Community Support Grants for Child Development.
5.    Two types of grants would be available to communities:
(a) Community Support Grants to communities are offered on the basis of matching contributions from
communities. These grants and contributions from communities will cover activities designed to support
interventions for child development and which fall within the guidelines and menu contained in the Project
Implementation Manual. To qualify for this grant, communities will provide counterpart contributions which maybe
in the form of goods, works or services. Examples of the uses of such grants are: construction and operation of
community child care centers, home based child care centers, or the production and marketing of weaning foods. The
support grants component will be implemented in the same 25 districts in Component 1.
(b) Innovation Grants are grants made available to communities to address child related problems. The
Innovation Grant will provide grants to implement interventions outside the menu of interventions described by the
community support grants (a) above. As the term implies, the "innovation" fund will be used to support
communities in implementing "innovative ideas" on improving the lives of children within their communities. The
Innovation Grant will be accessed by communities in the same manner as the community support grants: that is,
proposals prepared by communities following a participatory planning exercise, followed by screening by a sub-
county committee, and forwarded for funding by the project.
Project Component 3 - National Support Program for Child Development
6.    This component consists of central program activities and policy initiatives designed to support the district
level programs in components I and 2, and provide quality assurance for the frontline project activities at the
community level. This component includes:
(a) program monitoring and evaluation,
(b) support for preventive program initiatives on micronutrients,
(c) early childhood development (ECD) curriculum development,
(d) training of trainers for ECD,
(e) information, education and communications (IEC) and advocacy for children's rights.

Project Implementation
7.     The overall coordinating agency is the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development (MOPED). Given
the nature of activities, this project will be implemented at the grassroots level by local NGOs and community based
organizations, including womens' groups, savings groups and parents' groups. These organizations will be supported
by NGOs and other agencies who will be contracted to provide technical assistance and capacity building. The
Project Implementation Manual will spell out guidelines for community planning and implementation.
8.     Project coordination: At the national level, a Project Coordinating Office (PCO), within the Ministry of
Planning and Economic Development, and accountable to the Permanent Secretary, will coordinate and supervise
activities of the project. The PCO will be small, consisting of a Project Coordinator (PC), a Deputy Coordinator, and
a qualified accountant/financial officer. The PCO will contract out to private management/accounting firms or
NGOs such tasks as: monitoring and evaluation, accounting and management audit, procurement, and other tasks
related to implementation, such as technical support and training of implementors at the local level. The PCO will
ensure that program activities at the operational levels in the district, sub-county, parish and community are carried
out; and prepare periodic reports on implementation. The central level program support componenit will be
coordinated with the Ministry of Education (for curriculum development and training of ECD trainers), Ministry of
Health (for micronutrient deficiency control), and the Ministry of Gender and Community Development (for
advocacy).
9.     District coordination of implementation. All district level activities will be coordinated and supervised at the
district level by District Coordination Committees (DCC). Given the community based nature of activities, and the
decentralization of governmental functions, the program will be phased into districts based on the readiness of these
districts to implement program activities. Capacity building will precede implementation of the program in all
project districts, and implementation will be scaled-up only in those districts that meet the following criteria:
(1) District commitment, which includes a Bill passed into ordinance by the District Council certifying the
following: (a) counterpart funding of at least 5% of annual project disbursements or at least 3% over the previous
year's social sector budget, (b) draft agreement with NGOs or a lead agency in the district specifying working
relationships acceptable to the project, (c) project coordination committee and project task leader identified from
members of the standing committees or district administration staff, (d) planning process defined, (e) plan for health
referral from community to sub-county level health facility (government or private/NGO) identified, (f) concrete
district plans to support the national drive for Universal Primary Education identified, and examples of functional
literacy programs covering needs of women and early childhood development,(g) statement indicating gender
sensitivity of plans. (2) Implementation capacity, defined by: (a) lead NGO in place with adequate implementation
capacity or other facilitating mechanisms selected and approved by the district, (b) well-functioning district financial
mechanisms and management system in place.
IO.    Project oversight and policy guidance: This will be the responsibility of an inter-ministerial Project
Steering Committee (PSC) to be established, under the Chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of
Planning and Economic Development. The PSC, will provide overall guidance on policy matters and approve
recommendations on improving quality of project implementation. The PSC will include Permanent Secretaries or
representatives from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and Sports, Ministry of Gender and Community
Development, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Local Governments, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industries and
Fisheries, Ministry of Information, and representatives of the National Council for Children (NCC), the NGOs and
UNICEF. The PSC will meet every six months and will forward to IDA the minutes of the meetings. A Project
Management Advisory Committee (PMAC) consisting of technical experts in nutrition, early childhood development,
community planning and development, and finance will provide technical advise to the PCO as needed.

11.   Planning, accounting,financial reporting, and auditing arrangements. The Implementation arrangements
and processes are outlined in an implementation manual prepared by the Government in consultation with the Bank.
12.   Project monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements. A detailed Monitoring and Evaluation system
has been developed as part of the Project Implementation Manual.. A monitoring system which will be
computerized, will inform the management and policy makers on the progress of activities and impact on the
ground. The M&E will be guided by the project logical framework given in Annex I that spells out the relevant
process and outcome indicators of the project. The project M&E will be conducted through the following activities:
(a) regular quarterly meetings of the PSC chaired by the Permanent Secretary of MOPED; (b) IDA supervision
missions; (c) annual progress review by IDA; (d) mid-term review of the project conducted jointly with other donors
no later than 30 months after effectiveness; (e) baseline and repeat surveys of beneficiaries; (f) quarterly progress
reports based on the implementation milestones defined by the Annual Work Plan and Budget and (g) participatory
monitoring and evaluation involving communities and beneficiaries. The PC will submit to IDA a report on progress
of implementation and outcomes, to be received twice a year-- on July 31 and on January 31. A project
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be prepared within six months of the credit closing.

(a) Using a discount rate of 12%
(b) Financial analysis reflects the point of view of the preschool children and their parents.
(c) Benefits defined as incremental taxes obtained as a result of higher lifetime earnings of cohort of children in the
program, and the incremental earnings of the parents/mothers who will participate in the income/savings
component of the program. Costs: forgone income taxes.
(d) This includes costs incurred by the public and not borne by the program participants.
Main Results
The results indicate an economic rate of return of 18.5% indicating that the project is economically feasible.
Sensitivity analysis was used to test the effects using alternative assumptions of the benefit streams. First, a switching value
of the benefits on schooling performance in terms of repetition and drop-out rates was tested. The base run reflected in the
table above is based on an 8 percentage point improvement in completion rates. From these sensitivity runs, the break even
point--or the percentage completion rates that would bring the present value of benefits equal to the present value of costs is
about 5 percentage points, indicating that even small improvements in completion as a result of the project will already make
the project feasible. The results are robust, and the probabilty that the IRR would be less than the discount rate of 12% is
negligible.

Main Assumptions
Project benefits include household savings from the lower drop-out and repetition rates at the primary level and improved
health (lower morbidity) of the cohort of children reached by the project--estimated by the children-years gained from better
performance of the pupils who would be prepared as a result of the ECD program. The savings will accrue to the parents
who spend for schooling. Other benefits which could not be meaningfully monetized include fiscal savings from increased
efficiency in the delivery of basic education and health service.
It is also expected that over their lifetime, the earnings of those who were reached by the program will improve. The
incremental earnings have been calculated from a conservative assumption, based on research.
A second set of benefits accrue to the parents of the children in the ECD program who would participate in the
income/savings component. Since the component will generate skills and knowledge for microenterprise, it is expected to
yield higher incomes for these program participants.
The project will also benefit the community animateurs who will gain skills useful beyond the project life.

(c) District and community level implementation costs include costs related to child care workers, cost of running distt.
resource centers, M&E activities. National level operating costs include incremental operating costs incurred on account of
the project's implementation, management and supervision, including office supplies, communications costs, office
machinery, vehicle maintenance, vehicle fuel and spare parts, office rentals, salaries, travel and allowances of project staff.
(d) This amount includes financing by beneficiary communities as their matching fund shares in the community projects
funded by the community support grant component.
(e) Training programs and outcome indicators are included in the PIM. Training impact assessment will be conducted at
midterm review, at which community feedback will be sought. The Project Coordinator will closely monitor progress on
training programs.
Procurement Procedures
Procurement of goods and works will be consistent with World Bank guidelines on the procurement of goods, works, and
services in all respects.
(1) Procurement of vehicles, motorcycles and bicycles will be handled using International Competitive Bidding (ICB) using
Bank Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995, revised January and August 1996.
Standard bidding documents will be used for all ICB.
(2) Equipment, learning materials and community awareness/education (mass media services etc.), value up to US $3.6 -
million) will be procured using National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. These contracts would be over $20,000
and below $200,000 each.
(3) Contracts of goods and works under the Community Support Grants will be less than US$ 2,000 each, and up to an
aggregate of US $ 6-million. In addition aggregate value of contracts for goods and works related to the Innovations Grants
will be US$ 4.5 million. Goods and materials required for civil works and estimated to cost less than $20,000 each will be
obtained through the use of National Shopping procedures. Small works estimated to cost less than $ 20,000 each will be
procured by fixed price quotation obtained from 3 qualified contractors. However, the NGOs will monitor the community
organizations to ensure that procurement will be conducted in a transparent and accountable manner. The community
organizations will be provided with training on basic financial management and accounting required for managing the grants
and proceeds of the funds.
(4) Consultant and training contracts are expected to be below US$200,000; consultancy/TA costs would be up to an
aggregate of US $6.3 million. Most of the contracts, especially above US$100,000 each will be by Quality and Cost Based
Selection (QCBS). Individuals will be selected as per Section V of the Guidelines. Audit services will be procured by least
cost selection method. Services for project implementation will be provided by NGOs and given the specialized knowledge
and experience required in such services, the short list may comprise only of NGOs. Single source selection will be used
when justified, and with the approval of IDA, for contracts less than $100,000 each. Procurement of consultants/NGOs
services will be done following the Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers
(January 1997).

Project Accounts and Auditing
The PCO and the implementing entities will maintain adequate financial management systems in order to ensure that
accurate and timely information with respect to project resources and expenditures are available. The financial management
arrangements should include: (a) accounting based on Project Chart of Accounts to group expenditures by project
components/activities, disbursement categories and sources of funds, and appropriate accounting standards and reporting
formats, (b) arrangements for recording monitorable physical and other indicators for comparing with related costs, (c)
procurement contract management information, and (d) internal control arrangements to ensure proper segregation of duties,
documented procedures for authorizations, and levels of supervision. The PCO and the implementing entities will maintain
project accounts in accordance with sound accounting practices acceptable to IDA.
A financial management manual for this project will be used. A first draft dated July 1997 was prepared by a private firm,
Coopers and Lybrand, and extensively reviewed by IDA project staff. It is currently being revised.
The capacity of the PCO for accounting and financial management is already in place with the hiring of a full-time
finance/accounting officer in October 1997.
An annual audit report of project accounts, prepared by independent auditors acceptable to the Administrator and in
accordance with the Bank document "Financial Account Reporting and Auditing Handbook", January 1995 will be
submitted to IDA no later than six months after completion of each fiscal year.
Semi-annual audit reports of the Statement of Expenditures (SOE) will be submitted within three months of each period.
