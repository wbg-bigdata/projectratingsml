FELDA VI LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
I. AGRICULTURAL BACKGROUND
The Agricultural Sector
1.01      The agricultural sector holds a pre-eminent position in Malaysia's
economy, contributing around one third of GDP, more than one half of employ-
ment and almost 60% of foreign exchange earnings, the latter mostly based on
rubber and oil palm products, valued at about US$1.1 billion or 40% of
exports in 1977 in which Malaysia occupies a predominant position in the
world market. Agricultural production has grown at about 6% p.a. since
1970 and this trend is expected to continue in the near future. Continued
growth depends heavily on increased exports given favorable demand prospects,
Malaysia's physical comparative advantages, the high degree of competitiveness
developed over many years and the relatively limited scope for economically
justified import substitution in grains, dairy products and meats, which
represent the bulk of imports.
1.02      Of the 8 million cultivated acres in Peninsular Malaysia, rubber
occupies about 4.3 million; oil palms 1.3 million; and coconuts 0.5 million
for a total of more than 6 million acres under permanent tree crops, of which
almost two thirds are in smallholdings. The only other major crop is padi
with one million acres.  Other crops (all below 100,000 acres each) are
pineapple, cocoa, tapioca, sugarcane, tobacco, coffee and groundnuts.
Smallholdings and rural poverty are largely concentrated in rubber, padi and
coconut areas.
Agricultural Development Policy
1.03      Objectives.  Over a quarter of Third Malaysia Plan (TMP) development
expenditures (in 1976/80) will go to agriculture, more than to any other
sector. The main objectives of agricultural development policy are:
(a)  the eradication of rural poverty;
(b)  reinforcing Malaysia's predominant role in natural rubber and palm
oil production; and
(c)  giving added impetus and more stability to development and foreign
exchange earnings by introducing new export crops.
1.04      Strategy.  Government is making an all-out effort to pursue the
above objectives jointly to help equalize incomes with minimum losses in
productivity and production through a variety of programs (including Bank-
supported projects) related to: (a) integrated regional development in very
poor areas, e.g. Bank-financed Western Johore and North Kelantan projects;
(b) development of small irrigation, such as under the Bank's National
Small-Scale Irrigation Project; (c) development of traditional export crops,
particularly where they can alleviate poverty, such as rubber (Federal Land
Development Authority, FELDA projects) and coconuts (Coconut Smallholder



- 2 -
Development Project just appraised) and of more recent export crops, such as
palm oil, pineapples and cocoa; (d) development of applied research, experi-
mentation and extension (research and extension projects); (e) strengthening
of agencies dealing with the rural poor (UNDP/Bank State and Rural Development
Project); (f) iUentifying constraints to smallholder development and recom-
mending measures to overcome these (socio-economic survey of the Muda area);
and (g) last, but not least, increasing employment opportunities and the
number of poor families benefitting from projects (Bank dialogue with FELDA).
Replanting, Land Consolidation and Land Development in the Context of
Rural Poverty, and of the Rubber and Cocoa Subsectors
1.05      Introduction.  Three of the main public sector instruments to
achieve government development objectives are rubber replantings, land
consolidation and new land development, mainly for rubber and for oil palms,
but including cocoa beginning this year. The main agencies entrusted respec-
tively with replantings and land consolidation are RISDA (Rubber Industry
Smallholder Development Authority) and FELCRA (Federal Land Consolidation and
Rehabilitation Authority). The main agency entrusted with land development
is the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA).
1.06      Rubber.  Malaysia produces about one half of the world's output of
natural rubber and production is projected to increase at about 3% p.a.
through 1990. Even at this rate and the rates projected for the other main
rubber producing countries, i.e., Indonesia and Thailand, production is not
expected to meet: the potential future world market demand for natural rubber
beyond the mid-1980s. The favorable supply/ demand outlook is an important
factor in Government's renewed emphasis on rubber development.
1.07      Other factors supporting rubber development are (a) that Malaysia's
existing rubber areas are ecologically well suited to rubber production;
(b) there are still 3 to 4 million acres of virgin lands, much of which is
suited to rubber; (c) the large numbers of, and the high proportion of,
rural poor among rubber small-holders; (d) as a result of rubber being a
traLditional crop, the relative ease with which production could be expanded
based on the familiarity with its agricultural aspects of a large body of
Smallholders and landless people; and (e) the well-established and efficient
collection, processing and marketing channels available to practically all
producers.
1.08      The rubber subsector comprises the largest group of all the poor
(230,000 families or 30% of the total) in Malaysia. Rubber replanting in
smallholdings with higher yielding clones and improved farming practices to
increase productivity and incomes (and financed mainly out of cess proceeds)
has been, therefore, a major government policy for many years. Expenditures on
rubber replanting are expected to quadruple under the TMP 1976-1980, while
the area covered will be around 450,000 acres (or 90,000 ac p.a.), only
slightly above that of the previous five years. The high expenditures
are, therefore, almost exclusively the result of increases in the size of the
replanting grants given to smallholders reflecting higher subsistence, and
other input cost increases. Increases in yields and in area replanted have
proceeded on a sustained basis, but not nearly so rapidly as possible and
as Government would have wished. The main limitations have been scarce

managerial, administrative and technical staffing of RISDA, FELCRA and indivi-
dual state agencies. Government and the Bank are seeking ways to develop these
agencies' planning, training, project identification, preparation, and imple-
mentation capabilities with the support of a Bank-UNDP project staffed by a
team of recently appointed specialists. However, given the magnitude of the
task, the observed weaknesses in RISDA which result in inadequate quantity and
quality levels of replantings and the complexities associated mainly with land
tenure problems and very small holding sizes and their dispersion, improvements
through replanting are likely to come slowly, especially in the early stages
through the mid-1980s. Land consolidation (now proceeding at about 20,000
acres p.a.) is limited by the above factors, as well as by weaknesses in
FELCRA's planning and implementation, custom law, dispersion of authority among
different levels of government and last, but not least, sheer physical obstacles,
related to exchanges of holdings among beneficiaries. The above limitations
on replanting and consolidation will throw a heavier burden of increased produc-
tion, and of rural poverty alleviation on land development in the near future.
1.09      The current annual rate of land development by all agencies in
Peninsular Malaysia is about 160,000 acres. Of this about 60% is for oil palm
(and the balance for rubber), and about three fourths are being developed by
FELDA. The above current annual rate of land development is adequate to
eventually provide settlement for 18,000-20,000 families and jobs for about
30,000 people./1 This represents almost one fourth of the total incremental
annual employment requirement. The total impact of land development on
poverty is even greater, since it includes the effects of increased agricultural
production and higher incomes on the economy as a whole. These factors (and
replanting limitations, para. 1.08) amply justify a continued and expanding
rate of land development. FELDA, given its long experience, large-scale
operations, high levels of efficiency and sound financial condition is and
will remain for a number of years the most important executing agency in
reaching the Government's combined production and poverty eradication objec-
tives. The proposed project, which would help FELDA develop a minimum of
62,000 acres of rubber and settle 6,200 families, is part of the Government's
development strategy and originated in the continuing Bank/FELDA dialogue
which has resulted in smaller holding size and investment per family settled,
thereby increasing the number of beneficiaries and project impact on poverty
eradication.
1.10      Cocoa.  Private and government-sponsored plantings of cocoa as pure
stands and as interplantings with coconuts have been made in about 90,000
acres mostly in alluvial coastal soils since 1965. Plantings have been made
because of the advisability for Malaysia to diversity its agricultural produc-
tion and exports and profiting from suitable ecological conditions in selected
areas, adequate world market prospects, and successful disease control measures
(pest and diseases being the major constraint). Government now wishes to
expand cocoa plantings much more vigorously in new areas for the above
/1  Given the recent major increases in the rate of development and the
inevitable settlement lags, only about one half of the above settlement
figures is presently realized, but the proportion is bound to increase to
the potential level in a few years as the annual rate of development
stabilizes and time lags are reduced.



- 4 -
reasons, as well as because of the labor-intensive nature of cocoa produc-
tion, and has chosen FELDA as the only public agency capable of doing this.
EELDA's experience with cocoa dates back to 1970, when it established cocoa
nurseries and began its inland soils research and experimentation on about
5,000 acres in, Jengka (State of Pahang) under a Bank-financed project (Jengka
II). Under the project up to 10,000 acres would be developed as a pilot
project in areas to be selected building on this previous experience, and
would be eventually settled by about 1,500 families as part of government's
export diversification and rural poverty eradication strategies.
1.11      Annual Crops.  Finally, new cropping systems must be developed to
further reduce settlement costs per family, and to increase employment and
incomes of the rural poor project participants during the immature period of
permanent tree crop development. Given the dearth of experience on these
there is a basic n-ed to introduce practically oriented field experimentation
before major development can be undertaken on the basis of sustainable
cropping patterns. Under the project FELDA would help develop and supervise
experimental block plantings by settlers of semi-perennials and annuals on
about 500 acres.
1.12      In summary, it is Government's policy under the TMP to intensify its
efforts at increasing production, employment and incomes of the rural poor.
These goals justify continued and expanding land development and settlement.
FELDA, given its unique experience and capabilities in land development and
settlement has a most important role to play in this program. The proposed
project is especially directed at reducing the holding size and settlement
costs per family which would permit increasing the number of families settled.
The introduction of annual cropping trials in settlement areas, if successful,
would further help reduce cost per settler.  Additionally, the project would
initiate a diversification drive into cocoa.
II. FELDA
Background
2.01      FELDA was established in 1956 as a federal statutory agency
headquarterd in Kuala Lumpur to carry out land development and settlement
projects.
2. 02     From 1957 to 1960 FELDA allocated funds to state corporations and
land boards for federally approved land development schemes.  However,
because of coordination and other problems resulting in slow development new
legislation in 1960 gave FELDA direct responsibility for planning and imple-
mentation of land development projects. These include land clearing and
planting, village and infrastructure development, selection and placement of
settlers, schemie management, provision of credit, and processing and marketing
of settlers' produce.



-5-
Organization and Management
2.03      FELDA operates semi-autonomously under the Ministry of Land and
Regional Development. Operating policy is set and overall supervision is
provided by a Board consisting of 12 members which includes reprentatives
of the public, and of the private sector. FELDA's chief executive officer is
the Director General, who is also a member of the Board. The present Director
General is a highly capable civil servant and has been in this post since
1965. Under his management FELDA has developed and diversified its operations
substantially.
2.04      In 1972 and 1973 and responding to the greatly enlarged workload two
Deputy Directors General posts were established, one for field administration
(agricultural and social services) and one for technical services (planning
and budgeting, and processing). The present deputies have also been with
FELDA for several years and are competent administrators. Below headquarters'
level FELDA is organized in areas and within the areas in individual development
schemes.
2.05      Since 1972 FELDA has established a number of subsidiary corpora-
tions to handle specific aspects of its operations, such as village stores,
processing of settlers produce, marketing, transportation, and latex handling.
Additionally, FELDA plans to set up a research corporation in 1978. Each of
these corporations has its own Board and is intended to operate largely
independently on a day to day basis and with its own staffinvg and sources of
finance, with FELDA providing the coordination and supervision of its activities.
This major effort of decentralization has been both relatively well timed and
executed.
Policies and Procedures
2.06      FELDA's policies have progressively evolved since 1960.  They
consist of:
(a)  increasing productivity, production and exports as much as
possible by developing a maximum amount of previously virgin or
underutilized lands consistent with a high level of efficiency.
The maximum present rate of land development on this basis is
estimated at 120,000 acres p.a;
(b)  more recently initiating diversification efforts including develop-
ment of cane sugar and cocoa in the interest of the country and of
FELDA's income stabilization;
(c)  helping establish smallholders who are responsible for agricultural
production on an individual or cooperative basis;
(d)  providing settlers with incomes sufficiently high to enable them
to escape poverty and to help generate secondary economic growth.
The present minimum settler income target is M$3,600 (US$1,440)
p.a. which compares with an absolute poverty threshold of about
US$1,250 per family of five p.a. It is now based on individual 10



-6-
acre holdings (recently reduced from 14 acres for oil palms and 12
acres for rubber) and on an average investment (field, housing,
management and infrastructure) of about US$10,000 per family (or
about one-third below previous levels). These adjustments (appli-
cable to the proposed project) will permit increasing the number of
families settled by about one-third beginning this year, which is
more in line with Government's objective of poverty eradication;
(e) further ensuring that the benefits of supporting services such as
research, processing, transport and marketing accrue to settlers;
(f)  proviling settlers with decent living conditions from the moment of
their arrival in settlement areas by establishing settler villages
with the required facilities prior to settlers' arrival;
(g) minim:Lzing negative ecological impact of development by: (i) control-
ling erosion, siltation and excessive flooding, as well as preserving
water reserves and wildlife through maintenance of selected areas
under virgin forests and protecting these against illegal operators;
and (-ii) taking steps to control palm oil and rubber effluents.
2.07      To do these FELDA has developed a package approach which would be
foLlowed under the proposed project (Section III).
2.08      The Bank has played, and continues to play, a significant role in
persuading FELDA to lower its family income targets (with the resulting
reductions in investment per family, and holding size) to bring these more in
line with Goverrnment's poverty eradication plans which call for larger
numbers of poor benefitting from public investments. The Bank is encouraging
FEIDA's cocoa diversification and has been instrumental in improving FELDA's
management systems and procedures (paras. 2.18 to 2.20). These are major
direct and indirect factors underlying the proposed loan.
Staffing and Training
2.09      FELDA's staff numbered 4,800 at the end of 1976.  Of these roughly
75% were in the field directly involved with area and scheme management.
The staff is quite young, with 90% of staff under 40. Staff intake has
ranged from 300 to 400 p.a. in the last 5 years.  Staff expansion and
promotions are based on a vigorous in-service training program supplemented
by specific technical instruction conducted at seven locations.
Financial Condition
2.10      FELDA's main sources of funds are government loans and grants; Bank
loans; subsidiaries' and settlers' loan repayments, and management fees.
Interest earnings on deposits are projected to become an important source of
funds in future. FELDA's financial condition has steadily improved in the
past and is projected to continue to improve substantially through 1985 as
shown in Tables 1 and 2 below.

2.11      Government loans to FELDA are made mainly for relending to settlers
to cover the cost of agricultural development, housing, houselots and settler
subsistence during crop immaturity, bearing an interest rate of 5-1/2% with
repayment periods of 25 years including 10 years grace (no interest is charged
during the first 5 years of grace). Government grants cover FELDA's adminis-
trative expenses. Subloans to settlers are made at 6-1/4% interest (capitalized
during development) and are repayable in 24 years including 9 years of grace.
2.12      As shown in Table 1, FELDA's cash availabilities would increase up
to almost M$1.2 billion or US$490 million by 1985, which is equivalent to about
US$354 million in 1977 prices. However, FELDA's exceedingly good present and
forecast financial condition must be viewed in the context of the following:
(a) FELDA's cash is available to government at all times and it is
being increasingly used to purchase medium term government
securities;
(b) Government lending to FELDA and to its subsidiaries is being
progressively reduced;
(c) FELDA has ambitious expansion and diversification plans which it
would have to finance out of its own resources and commercial
borrowings under more stringent terms and conditions than through
government lending;
(d) FELDA must bear the responsibility for maintaining settler incomes at
or close to expectations (based on which the participants moved into
the settlement schemes). This requires income stabilization reserves
which are very much in the minds of FELDA's management, but for which
no formal allowance has been made in the accounts.
All of these (not taken into account in FELDA's cashflow projections (Tables
I and 2) are likely to reduce FELDA's liquidity substantially over the
next eight years. It is for this and other reasons, such as FELDA's tight
financial controls that Government has decided to maintain FELDA's present
and projected cash availabilities under the latter's control.
Accounts and Audit
2.13      Accounts are generally segregated based on the nature of the opera-
tions and are kept separate down to scheme level. FELDA's Treasurer is respon-
sible for keeping a strict cash control based on operations and investments.
FELDA's accounts have been progressively adapted to electronic data processing.



- 10 -
2.14      The Finance Department preaudits, controls and audits accounts and
iis responsible for financial planning and policy formulation. External
auditing is carried out by independent private auditors.
FELDA's Performance
2.15      At December 31, 1976 FELDA had (a) developed 813,000 ac of land (of
which 516,000 ac for oil palms, 283,000 ac for rubber, 10,000 ac for sugarcane
and 4,000 ac of cocoa); (b) settled about 40,000 families; and (c) built 19
palm oil mills with a total capacity of about 750 tons ffb per hour. At that
clate land development and mill construction targets had been met.
2.16      During 1977-1980 FELDA will strive to clear and plant 120,000 ac
p.a. (or 20,000 ac p.a. more than its past five-year levels) under government
instructions aLnd in view of other public agencies' inability to fulfill their
targets under the TMP. Settlement accelerated from 5,000 families in 1976
to 6,000 families in 1977 and is projected to continue increasing up to a
mLaximum sustainable level of 12,000 p.a. by 1982/83 due to FELDA's reduction
of individual holding sizes to a uniform 10 ac, and to reduction of time
lags between land development and settler arrival in lots. Felmill is
projecting the commissioning and/or expansion of five new palm oil mills p.a.
for the next five years.
2.17      FELDA's land development and settlement standards have consistently
improved over the years and today are rated as very good. Rubber yields are
roughly as planned, although efforts are being made to improve tapping discip-
line to control bark consumption and thereby prolong the economic life of
trees. In oil palms steps are being taken to improve assisted pollination and
harvesting standards.
2.18      There are two aspects of FELDA's operations where major weaknesses
have been identified by Bank missions. These are FELDA's management informa-
tion systems, and Felmill's efficiency of mill operations.
2.19      FELDA began using computers in 1969.  The recently established Data
Processing Department (DPD) handles all data collection, processing, analysis
and dissemination. Since the last Bank supervision mission in early 1977,
FELDA has done the following: (a) DPD staff have been expanded and upgraded
and further expansion is contemplated for 1978 and beyond; (b) computer core
size and computer utilization have been increased; (c) user departments are
getting involved in systems development and changes; and (d) private consul-
tants have been hired to review programs, rationalize documentation and
design systems packages for audit. FELDA is aware of its future office space
needs and the lack of control of its confidential data, as well as the need
for developing systems which go beyond basic financial and personnel data
processing. All of these improvements attest to FELDA's ability to repond to
major problems rapidly and effectively (Annex 1).



- 11 -
2.20      Regarding Felmill's mill design and operations substantial improve-
ments are being made. Since early 1977 Felmill has: (a) started training
mill engineers at a specialized outside center; (b) established a mill
construction design committee and organized feedback information to the
committee by individual mill managers; (c) established a quality control
section to reduce palm oil losses; (d) started a system which penalizes
settlers for poor assisted pollination and harvesting to improve quality of
ffb and timing of delivery to mills; and (e) begun reviewing mill maintenance
systems. These should go a long way to improving Felmill's performance and
will allow FELDA's management to concentrate its attention on expanding the
rate of its land settlement, pursuing development alternatives and getting
more involved with Government's poverty eradication plans in coordination
with other agencies.
2.21      Regarding pollution, which has become a major issue in Malaysia
recently, Government has enacted legislation (November 4, 1977) setting very
stringent pollution controls starting in 1978. FELDA and private companies
have set up a M$10 million pollution research and experimentation fund for
1978 and efforts are being made to coordinate these activities, which are
largely directed to control palm oil effluents, by far the worst offenders
(rubber and cocoa pollution are small in comparison and presently manageable),
and reflect the industry's concern with the environment (Annex 2).
2.22      In summary, FELDA's performance has consistently improved over the
years parallel with substantial increases and diversification of operations.
Improvements are being made to remedy identified weaknesses. The Bank has
been, and should continue to be, instrumental in improving FELDA's performance
and in modifying FELDA's policies in line with the country's socio-economic
goals.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Introduction
3.01      The Government of Malaysia has asked the Bank to help finance FELDA's
72,500 ac land development and settlement program in three areas of the state
of Pahang and one in the state of Negri Sembilan in Peninsular Malaysia (Map 13272).
Total project costs are estimated at M$231 million (US$92.3 million). The
proposed Bank loan would amount to US$28 million or 30% of project costs.
3.02      The project was prepared by FELDA.  This report is based on the
findings of the appraisal team consisting of Messrs. Andreu and Arichandran,
and Ms. Sjamsu (Bank); and Messrs. Evans and Head (consultants) which visited
Malaysia in September/October 1977.



- 12 -
3.D3      The proposed project would be the sixth that the Bank has financed
with FELDA as executing agency. The first (Jengka I, Loan 533-MA for
US$14 million and started in 1968) and the second (Jengka II, Loan 672-MA for
US$13 million and started in 1970) have been successfully completed. The
third (Jengka III, Loan 885-MA for US$25 million) was started in 1972. The
full area of 40,000 ac has been planted but settlement is slightly behind
sclhedule. The fourth (Johore, Loan 967-MA for US$40 million) was started in
1974. Implementation is roughly on schedule. The fifth (Keratong, Loan
1044-MA for US$36 million) was started in 1975. Land development, roads and
miLl construction are roughly on schedule. Village development has been
delayed because of poor coordination between FELDA and the state agency
in charge of urban development, but this is improving. In summary, FELDA's
performance under previously financed Bank projects has been very good.
Weaknesses observed are being effectively remedied (paras. 2.18-2.21).
B. Brief Project Description
3.04      The proposed project would include FELDA's development activities
in the project areas (which were started in early 1977) for a period of six
years, 1979-84. Main project components would be:
(a) development of a minimum 62,000 ac of rubber; up to 10,000 ac of
cocoa as a pilot project; and 500 ac of annual cropping on an
experimental basis;
(b)  construction of two urban centers, two urban subcenters and five
villages including roads, housing, schools, clinics, stores and
community centers; and
(c) Settlement of 6,200 families in rubber holdings, and hiring
1,500 laborers for cocoa who would eventually become settlers.
The project would be implemented under present FELDA organization, management
policies and prccedures, which have shown to be effective over many years of
experience and which have applied to previous Bank-financed projects.
C. Detailed Features
Project Areas
3.05      These are:  (a) Kerau, in West Pahang, about 25 miles northwest
of Raub, (b) Bukit Sagu, in East Pahang, 20 miles northwest of the Port of
Kuantan; (c) Lepar Hilir, in East Pahang, 30 miles southwest of Kuantan; and
(d) Serting, in Negri Sembilan, 44 miles from Seremban. Crops would be
established as follows (in acres):/1
/1 The total size and allocation of cocoa areas are merely indicative.
Final selection would be made on the basis of adequate field surveys
(para. 3.09).

3.06      Project areas are presently under virgin forest.  The terrain is
undulating to rolling with friable deep, sandy to heavy clay loams, suitable
for rubber and in selected places for cocoa. Rainfall is more evenly distri-
buted in East Pahang and more seasonally distributed in Kerau and Serting and
ranges from 80 (Kerau and Serting) to 120 in (East Pahang) p.a. Access to
a large part of the project area is provided by asphalted highways, and
well-maintained timber extraction roads, many of which would be further
improved and serve as project roads. Radio and telephone communication is
already available in adjoining and nearby towns. Water supply for the
project would come from local surface sources, which are adequate.
Agricultural Development
3.07      Project lands are owned by the States of Pahang and Negri Sembilan,
but have been allocated to FELDA for development. Before FELDA begins its
operations, and in accordance with a time schedule which meets FELDA's
requirements, marketable timber is extracted by licensees under the super-
vision of the State Forest Department. Assurances were obtained from Govern-
ment during negotiations that timber extraction will not be allowed to delay
FELDA's land clearing program.
3.08      Felling, land clearing and burning, which are mostly done manually,
would take place from October through March. A leguminous cover crop is
planted afterwards followed by lining. Planting would be made from September
through February. These operations, as well as maintenance for the 18 months
following planting, would be undertaken by private contractors under FELDA
supervision. Rubber settlers and would-be cocoa settlers would take up
maintenance and harvesting thereafter. The clearing and planting schedule
would be as follows:

More land would be cleared than planted to allow mostly for roads and village
areas. Planting material would be procured largely from FELDA nurseries
(rubber) and from private sources (cocoa). Seed for annual crops would also
be provided froma private sources.
3.09      Rubber would be developed on a minimum 62,000 acres on the basis of
10 ac individual holdings and investment per family including agricultural
development, housing, management amd infrastructure would be about US$10,000.
FELDA would pay particular attention to ensure pure cover cropping and full
rubber stands a year after planting. Cocoa would be planted in up to 10,000 ac,/1
the actual sites and acreage to be determined after the necessary detailed surveys
are conducted and in consultation with the Bank. Assurances on this were
obtained during negotiations. If the areas eventually selected amounted to less
than 10,000 ac the difference would be planted to rubber. Because of the
pi]ot nature of cocoa plantings in the project area's soils cocoa maintenance
and harvesting would be undertaken initially by hired labor mainly because of
FELDA's concern with pruning standards and disease control, which are much
more easily carried out under centralized management than through autonomous
settlers who are less inclined to follow strict labor discipline. Hired labor
would be able ta, participate in profits based on specifics to be determined at
a later date. It is intended to turn cocoa workers into smallholder cocoa
settlers once satisfactory agricultural standards are reached.
3.10      FELDA has experimented in the past with land development alternatives
involving bigger settler participation and a degree of annual cropping in
settlers' houselots. Results have been disappointing, because permanent tree
crop yields have been reduced through lower maintenance standards and houselot
lands have gone unplanted or poorly planted. Main difficulties in devising
suitable alternatives have been the unfamiliarity of settlers (many of whom
are landless) with agricultural practices (which would require a substantial
technical and administrative backup) topography and the overall lack of
research and experimentation on annual crops in inland soils. FELDA, however,
continues to be interested in finding alternatives which would help stabilize
family incomes and make fuller use of settler labor, especially during immaturity
of permanent tree crops. Under the project FELDA would implement a pilot
subproject with these objectives in mind offering the possibility of obtaining
a higher net present value of investments than under past systems. An
experimental 500 ac of annual and/or semi-perennial crops would be selected
by FELDA in consultation with the Bank with due regard to ecology and location,
and would be developed as a block by settlers, the specifics to be determined
based on experience. Assurances on this were obtained during negotiations.
Maintenance, harvesting and marketing would be made with the necessary FELDA
support in the initial years.
/1 Processing facilities costing less than US$1 million would be financed by
FELDA outside of the project.

Urban Development
3.11      Settlers and hired labor would be located as follows:

The sizes of the planned urban centers and of the subcenters have been estab-
lished with a view to providing secondary schooling, small hospitals and more
social amenities and of allowing for more small business development on an
experimental basis in conditions where diseconomies of scale, such as distance
from plantings are minimized. The villages would follow the well-tested
FELDA models.
3.12      Infrastructure standards would conform to FELDA practice, which
allows for flexibility to meet different growth trends and a smooth transition
for settlers from the traditional village environment to a more urban environ-
ment. The houselots at one-fourth of an acre each would allow the settlers
to grow vegetables and fruits. and to keep some household animals. Vital
services would be accessible by foot. Housing (to be built by private
contractors employed by FELDA) would be very simple, allowing for future
upgrading on a self-help basis as settlers' incomes improve.
3.13      Roads.  About 30.5 miles of access roads and 75.5 miles of intra-
settlement area roads would be built. All road construction would be carried
out by the Federal and State Public Works departments (PWD), while road
maintenance would be the responsibility of the latter.  Both of these receive
federal budget allocations for these purposes. Agricultural roads within the
plantings would be built and maintained by FELDA. These are systems used
successfully in all previous FELDA development.
3.14      Treated water would be supplied to the urban areas from surface
water sources. Each house would have its own water connection. The water
supply systems would be designed and constructed by the Federal PWD and
operated and maintained by the State PWD. The water would be metered and
initially charged at M$1 per 1,000 gallons. Charges would be adjusted
periodically to permit recovering capital costs over 30 years and covering
operating costs. The only sewerage facilities to be provided to settlers
would be "back houses," as is customary in FELDA villages. This is satisfac-
tory considering the low initial population density and the adequate soil
conditions in the urban areas.



- 16 -
3.15      Schools.  A primary school would be provided with six classrooms
per 400/450 families. One secondary school for each center and subcenter
would also be provided. All schools would be utilized in two shifts. These
are federal standards for all development areas.  One health subcenter
would be built in each Bukit Sagu and Serting and staffed by one hospital
assistant and a nurse, benefiting additionally from regular visits by a
physician. Each village (and the subcenter at Lepar Hilir) would have a
community clinvic staffed with one nurse. In addition, each scheme neighbor-
hood would have a community center, a public playing field and a mosque.
Electricity (by diesel generators) would be supplied only to offices and staff
quarters during the first phase of development (up to 10 years). This is
justified both due to the initial low population densities and in an effort
to reduce settlement costs. Construction funds for the community centers and
the mosques would come from federal grants through FELDA. Investment and
operating funds and staff for the school and health facilities would be
provided by the respective ministries following federal standards and would be
built by PWD.
3.16      A cooperative shop for consumer goods, operated initially by the
FELDA Stores Corporation and later by a settlers' cooperative is to be built
by contractors hired by FELDA in each scheme in conjunction with the scheme
office. Eventually the increased settlers' purchasing power and the availa-
bility of labor should induce the establishment of more commercial and
service facilities.
Settler Selection
3.17      Rubber settlers and cocoa hired labor would be selected from an
existing pool of more than 12,000 candidates (balance of a recruitment drive
ended in 1974) augmented by new recruitment. As in the past settlers would
be between 18 and 35 years old, in good health and would be selected on the
basis of family size, agricultural background, and poverty level. Hired
cocoa labor in expectation of settlement would be selected on the same
basis.
Project Staffing and Facilities
3.18      Therie would be a manager with a staff of 17 to 26 persons per scheme.
T'heir housing would also be provided through private contractors based on
well-established modules. Each scheme office would be provided with two
four-wheel drive vehicles, and one diesel electricity generator.
D. Costs
3.19      Projiect costs from 1979 through 1984 are estimated at M$231 million
(LJS$92.3 million), of which about US$19.4 million or 21% would be in foreign
exchange. Cosits would be as follows:

FELDA costs are expressed at December 1977 levels and are based on FELDA's
long and relevant experience with rubber development, as well as on experience
gained by private cocoa planters, which, together with the competitiveness
and efficiency of FELDA-hired contractors, as well as the standardization of
development systems and procedures justify a low 5% physical contingency
provision for FELDA expenditures. A 10% physical contingency has been
allowed for infrastructure costs also based on past experience. Price
increases are estimated at: imported fertilizer and chemicals: 7.5% p.a. in 1978
and 1979 and 7% thereafter; vehicles: 7.5% in 1978/79 and 7% thereafter;
salaries, land development and housing, 7% p.a in 1978/84; water supply 9% in
each 1978 and 1979 and 8% p.a. thereafter; and roads, 8% p.a. in 1978 and
1979 and 7% p.a. thereafter. Taxes and duties represent less than 2% of
project costs.

E. Financing
3.20      Financing would be as follows:
Table 7: PROJECT FINANCING PLAN
Government           Bank
Loans   Grants   Subtotal             Total
FELDA expenditures                    86.1    30.3       116.4    70.0    186.4

Total in US$ million                  34.4    29.9        64.3    28.0      92.3
Percentage of total                   38       32         70       30      100
The Bank loan for US$28 million would represent 30% of total costs and would
cover US$19.4 m:Lllion of foreign exchange costs and US$8.6 million of local
costs. The size of the Bank loan would enable the Bank to make a reasonably
significant contribution to project costs and this requires financing part of
local costs, which is also justified on project grounds given the important
role of this project in continuing the Bank/FELDA dialogue and in helping
FELDA meet the country's socio-economic goals by increasing substantially the
number of families settled annually.  The balance of US$64.3 million (70% of
project costs) would be provided by Government to FELDA in the form of loans
(U';$34.4 million) for field agricultural development and of grants totaling
US'i29.9 million, of which US$12 million would be to cover management costs
ancl US$17.9 million for infrastructure.
3.21      The Government would onlend the proceeds of the Bank loan to
FELDA at an interest rate of 7.5% and a maturity of 25 years including
10 years grace. Additional Government funds would be lent to FELDA under the
prcject; such funds were lent in the past at 5-1/2% for 25 years including 10
years grace with no interest for the first 5 years.  FELDA's present onlending
terms to smallholders are as follows: for rubber settlers 24 years maturity
with 9 years grace at 6-1/4% interest capitalized. A new activity for FELDA
under the project would be lending to cocoa estates. These loans are expected
to carry 22 years maturity with 7 years grace at 6-1/4% interest capitalized.
Assurances were obtained that the above lending terms under the project would not
be materially altered except in agreement with the Bank. Lending terms to FELDA,
settlers and estates are based on the crops's immaturity and production periods.
Government would assume the foreign exchange risks and would finance additionally
management and infrastructure expenditures in the form of grants. Government
would make availiable all development funds to FELDA directly (loans) and
indirectly (grants) monthly and in advance as in the past. Assurances were
obtained on these during negotiations.



- 19 -
F. Procurement
3.22      Contracts with an estimated value of about US$35.0 million (about 37%
of project costs) would be let under international competitive bidding proce-
dures in accordance with Bank Guidelines. These are for land clearing, plant-
ing and initial maintenance (US$23.5 million), housing and office buildings
(US$10.0 million) and vehicles (US$1.5 million). Experienced land development
and housing contractors are available in Malaysia and have performed success-
fully in the past at costs that could not be matched by international firms and,
therefore, these contracts are likely to be won by local entities. Fertilizer
and chemicals (about US$12.3 million) would be procured under local competitive
bidding as in the past, with foreign contractors allowed to bid. Major
fertilizer and chemical companies are well represented in the country and are
competitive. It would be neither practical nor economical to establish a
separate supply system for the project.
3.23      Roads, water supply and public buildings (US$17.9 million) would be
financed by Government and constructed on PWD force account, which is the
standard Government/FELDA arrangement and which has proved satisfactory in the
past. The remaining costs (US$27.1 million) are direct FELDA expenditures
which are not suitable for competitive bidding and include management salaries,
operating costs, settler wages, and planting materials.
3.24      The standard procedure for FELDA projects would be followed under
which FELDA will not need to obtain prior Bank agreement to awards of bids
for amounts not exceeding US$500,000 for housing, agricultural development
(excluding land clearing contracts and maintenance), and fertilizer, chemicals
and seed, contracts. In the case of land clearing contracts the limit under
this project would be US$1,000,000. At this limit, prior Bank agreement
would be obtained for only the larger contracts totalling about 30% of all
contracts for land clearing. FELDA would submit for the Bank's agreement
standard designs for civil works, such as settler and staff housing and these
would be understood to be applicable to individual contracts unless specified
otherwise, in which case individual details would be provided to the Bank.
These would eliminate substantial administrative costs and delays.
G. Disbursement
3.25      The Bank would disburse against 60% of the costs of land clearing
and planting, initial maintenance, housing and office buildings; 100% of the
foreign exchange cost of imported fertilizer, chemicals, seeds, vehicles and
equipment; 100% of the ex-factory costs of locally manufactured items and 60%
of the costs of locally procured items. IBRD projected disbursements are
given below:

1980                            5.7                                8.3
1981                            5.5                               13.8
1982                            4.2                               18.0
1983                            4.3                              22.3
1984                            4.1                              26.4
1985 (1st quarter)              1.6                              28.0
Disbursements would be made against appropriate documents and would follow
the procedures adopted in previous Bank loans for FELDA projects.
H. Accounts and Audit
3.26      FELDA's and Government's fiscal year is January 1 through December 31.
FEL)A's overall accounts and ongoing Bank-financed project accounts are
audited by well qualified and experienced independent auditors. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that FELDA would maintain separate project
accounts and that: these as well as FELDA's overall accounts would be audited
by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank. Assurances were also
obtaLined that FELDA would furnish the Bank, within six months following the
close of the fiscal year, audited project accounts, as well as FELDA's audited
overall financial statements.
I. Monitoring
3.27      FELDA would assign specific responsibilities for monitoring the
project. Assurances on this were obtained during negotiations. FELDA's
already existing and to be improved systems for data collection and analyses
would satisfy project monitoring requirements. The key project indicators
(already being used by FELDA) would include unit costs timing of planting and
settlement, as well as uniformity of tree stands, condition of cover crop and
yields. Very small deviations are expected on these, given their standard
nature.
J. Ecological Impact
3.28      FELDA's customary safeguards against erosion and siltation and
others (para. 2.06, g) would apply to the project. Block rubber plant's
effluent contains about 1,500 ppm (particles per million) BOD (biological
oxygen demand) ancl effluent from concentrated latex plants contains 5,000 to
10,000 ppm BOD. These concentrations, which would be ecologically harmful if
released in their original condition, would be treated through anaerobic and
aerobic ponding with raw sludge to reduce BOD concentration below 100 ppm,
which is acceptable, followed by field application in suitable drainage and
topographic conditions. Through these means, which are economically justified,
there would be no negative project impact on the ecology. Cocoa's ecological
impact would be minimal by the very nature of the crop and of its processing.



- 21 -
K. Project Risks
3.29      The main project risks are those related to rubber and cocoa prices.
Other risks relate to the timing of settlement and to control of cocoa pests
and diseases. However, a high probability of project success is ensured
given FELDA's experience, continued large volume of operations, well tested
policies and procedures applicable to the project and high levels of efficiency.
IV. TECHNICAL COEFFICIENTS
Rubber
4.01      Rubber yield estimates are as follows:
Table 9: RUBBER YIELD ESTIMATES
Year from clearing         Tapping year         Yield per acre
(lb)
9                       1                      750
10                       2                   1,000
11                       3                   1,300
12                       4                   1,400
13-32                    5-24                1,500
Yields in tapping years 5 through 24 would stabilize due to ethrel applications
which would compensate for otherwise very slowly declining yields beginning in
year 15.
Cocoa
4.02      Cocoa yield estimates are:
Table 10: COCOA YIELD ESTIMATES
Yield per acre
Year from planting                       (lb dry beans)
4                                       75
5                                      280
6                                      520
7                                      720
8                                      880
9                                      950
10 through 16                        1,050
17 through 30                        1,000



- 22 -
4. 03     The above yield estimates are highly reliable, since they have
been made on the. basis of many years of experience under similar conditions by
FELDA for rubber and by private estates for cocoa and they allow for lower
initial FELDA yields in the latter case.
V. PROJECT PRODUCTION, DEMAND AND MARKETING
Rubber
5.01      Peak project-generated rubber production beginning about 1992 is
estimated at 42,000 tons, which is insignificant in terms of projected world
trade in rubber. The Bank forecasts slowly increasing prices in 1977 terms
for natural rubber which would be about US$0.43/lb by the mid-1980s in
response to demand progressively outstripping supply during the period,
assuming no drop in oil prices in real terms and no excessive expansion in
production capacity of basic petrochemicals. On these bases, which appear
reasonable, no marketing problems are envisaged. Latex would be transported
by either FELDA Marketing Corporation [FELMA] or private buyers to processing
plants to be turnied into latex concentrate or block rubber. Rubber would be
sold1 by FELMA in the world market through its well established and efficient
marlceting channels.
Cocoa
5.02      Peak project-induced cocoa production beginning by 1990, all of
which would be for export, is estimated at 4,800 tons of dry beans which is
insignificant in relation to amounts traded worldwide. World cocoa production
is ehstimated to increase at 3% p.a. during 1975-1985, which is a higher
ratE than the 2.1% p.a. experienced from 1969/72 to 1975 and which is due to
production expansion plans now being implemented. As a result of this, and
of the projected continuation of lower past demand growth trends, prices in
1977 terms are estimated to decline to US$0.57 per lb by 1985 but would still
remain attractive at this level. These are conservative assumptions. In the
past erratic production shortfalls have resulted in temporarily much higher
prices. The project's cocoa production would be marketed also by FELMA.
Annuals
5.03      Annuals and semi-perennial crops to be produced under the project on
about 500 acres would be chosen by FELDA taking into account domestic marketing
prospects among others.  The small amounts involved and the marketing analysis
which would be made by FELDA prior to development ensure a low degree of risk
in selling the incremental production.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
On-Farm
6.01      A typical rubber settler's financial condition in a 10 acre holding
under the project is given in Table 11. Settler families typically arrive on
their holdings about three years after felling, and during the crop's immaturity
period through year 8 are paid wages by FELDA in line with their previous
income levels (M$1,200 p.a. for a family of five or about US$100 per capita.
Beginning with the first harvest in year 9, net cash available would improve
substantially (beginning at M$1,800 p.a.) and at full production in year 13
net cash availabilities would amount to about M$5,500 p.a. per family (US$440
per capita) which compares with the critical consumption level of about
M$5,000 or US$400 per capita, which is deemed adequate as a cushion against
adverse rubber price movements in the absence of other sources of income.
6.02      A typical 2,000 acre cocoa block planting's financial condition is
given in Table 12. The projected financial rate of return of cocoa investments
would be 17%. Workers would earn M$3,600 p.a. (US$1,440 or about three times
their incomes without the project) during the first phase of development and
would obtain incomes similar to those of rubber settlers when they become
settlers themselves.
Prolect Impact on FELDA
6.03      The same sources and uses of funds for FELDA in general (Tables 1
and 2) would apply for the project and in the same historical pattern. The
resulting cash flow projection is given in Table 13.
6.04      FELDA's cash flow shows accumulated surpluses throughout the
project's life eventually amounting to USS$27 million. These originate in
FELDA's favorable borrowing terms related to its lending terms.
Project Impact on Government Finances
6.05      Government's total financial commitment to the project would amount
to M$249 million (or about US$100 million) by 1988. However, substantial
project-derived rubber export duties, together with full recovery of Govern-
ment loans made to FELDA would not only help recover government's expendi-
tures, but would result in accumulated surpluses totalling about M$0.9 billion
(US$350 million) by the end of the project's life in year 2012. Government's
projected cash flow is given in Table 14 below.
Cost Recovery
6.06      Project costs, excluding such infrastructure as multipurpose roads,
public buildings and FELDA's supervision expenses would be financed as loans
and recovered fully. Under the project such loans amount to US$62.4 million
or 68% of total project costs and would be recovered at an interest rate of
6-1/4%. In the case of rubber, in addition to loan repayments, the settlers
would have indirectly paid a replanting cess and export duties which are
equivalent to 65% of their net cash incomes at full development. Settlers
would also be liable to pay income tax at 6% on incomes of over M$6,000. In
the case of the pilot cocoa project, land areas would be fully developed and
owned by FELDA with settlers participating as hired labor.

VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
7.01      At full development beginning around the year 1,992, r oject-gener-
ated incremental annual rubber production would be valued at US$32 million and
cocoa production at US$4.5 million. The project would help Malaysia profit
from opportunities to satisfy demand for natural rubber which would otherwise
be realized by default by synthetic rubber producers. Cocoa production would
help Malaysia diversify its exports. The trials with annual crops and
semiperennials would hopefully lead to further diversification and help
increase and stabilize settler incomes, as well as reduce cost per settler.
7.02      Project-induced direct incremental employment would amount to about
8,000 fulltime temporary jobs in land clearing operations and to about 7,700
jobs among settler families.
7.03      The economic rates of return are estimated at 18% for rubber and at
16% for cocoa (see Tables 15 and 16). The combined IERR is about 18%. The
following assumptions were made for the economic analysis:
(a)  off-farm investment and operating costs were calculated at
December, 1977 levels;
(b)  costs of water supply, schools and health centers were excluded
because benefits therefrom, which are difficult to quantify, were
also excluded and are assumed to be at least equal to costs;
(c)  output prices, based on official Bank estimates adjusted to the
economic farm-gate levels are estimated at M$0.97 per lb
for rubber and M$1.34 per lb for cocoa in constant 1977 levels;
(d)  costs and benefits were adjusted to take into acount transfer
payments, such as cess, export and import duties;
(e)  contract labor for land clearing, planting and initial maintenance
was costed at market rates because it is drawn from a competitive
market; settler labor wages have been set at the level of the
estimated income foregone;
(f)  the opportunity value of project lands is insignificant and,
therefore, no cost has been attached to them;
(g)  foreign exchange was valued at the official rate; and
(h)  a project life of 30 years was assumed.

Sensitivity Analysis
7.04      The most probable variations in parameters are those related to
prices and costs.  A rate of return sensitivity analysis based on possible
changes in these is summarized in Table 17 below.

The above table shows that the most likely adverse changes in project para-
meters would not greatly affect the project's economic viability.
7.05     Using an exchange rate consistent with a suggested standard conversion
factor of 0.84, the economic rate of return would rise to 19%.
VIII. SUMMARY OF ASSURANCES
8.01      The following assurances were obtained during negotiations:
From Government
(a) it would ensure that timber extraction in project areas will not be
allowed to delay FELDA's land clearing (para. 3.07);
(b) it would make available to FELDA all development funds monthly and
in advance as in the past (para. 3.21);
From FELDA
(c)  it would make the necessary detailed surveys and consult with
the Bank before selecting the areas to be developed under cocoa
(para. 3.09);
(d)  it would consult the Bank prior to selecting the experimental
annual cropping area (para. 3.10);



- 32 -
(e)  it would appoint independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank
to audit project accounts and FELDA's overall accounts (para. 3.26);
and would furnish the Bank, within 6 months of the closing of the
fiscal year, with audited project accounts, as well as FELDA's
audited overall financial statements (para. 3.26);
(f)  it would assign specific responsibilities for project monitoring
(para. 3.27).
8.02      Lending terms under the project would not be materially changed
except in agreement with the Bank (para. 3.21).
8.03      With the above assurances the proposed project would be suitable for
a Bank loan to Government of US$28 million repayable in 17 years including
4 years of grace at an interest rate of 7.5%.

FELDA VI LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Management Reporting
i.        This Annex sets forth findings, conclusions and recommendations
regarding payroll, personnel, accounting and information systems in FELDA and
the several corporations within the FELDA organizational framework. The
Annex contains three sections: I) background information and analysis of the
staff, equipment, computer use and computer facilities supporting those
systems; II) analysis of a prior review of FELDA's financial and other systems
incorporated in the April 1977 Supervision Report as Annex 5, and of steps
taken by FELDA to improve its performance; and III) additional recommendations
for the future. The information presented is based on interviews with data
processing personnel and with existing, developing and future users of auto-
mated information systems, and on review of existing systems documentation
and utilization reports.
1.   BACKGROUND
1.01      FELDA began using computers for payroll and settler accounting in
1969. In 1972, these basic systems were supplemented by a general accounting
ledger system which also provided for cash, budgetary expenditure and revenue
reporting. Other systems directly related to the general ledger accounting
system including inventory, contract, fixed asset and equipment utilization
reporting were subsequently developed. The general ledger and related
systems were designed and installed by an outside consultant and used the
services of a local computer service bureau.
1.02      In 1975, FELDA acquired on a rental basis its own third generation
computer and data entry equipment. Further systems including research and
scientific applications have been implemented since 1975.
1.03      On July 1, 1975, Felmill became a separate FELDA corporation with
its own accounting and payroll systems. Separate corporation status is also
accorded to marketing, transport, stores and latex handling. These entities
currently make only incidental use of data processing services and reports.
1.04      FELDA's Data Processing Department (DPD) provides support services
to FELDA and Felmills and would be the service organization called upon to
fulfill additional data processing requirements developing in the several
corporations under the FELDA umbrella. DPD's staffing as of September 1977
was as follows: 1 Director, 3 Senior computer systems analysts, 2 Computer
systems analysts, 6 Programmers, 5 Operations staff, 9 Keypunch and data
preparation personnel and 2 Administrative assistants, for a total of 28
staff. Substantial staff expansion in the computer systems analyst and
programmer complement has been targeted beginning in October 1977. This
expansion and additional staffing needs are discussed in Part II (1).

1.05      The current budget for DPD is M$900,000.  The funding source is
general administration. No service fees are received.
1.06      The equipment operated by DPD consists of an IBM System 370 Model
115 medium-sized third generation computer with 192 K internal core storage,
4 disk and 2 tape drives, a 1,200 line per minute printer and a 60 card per
minute card reader. The data entry system is a GCS-2100 key-to-disk-to-tape,
with seven key stations. In addition, there is one IBM keypunch machine used
by programmers. Upgrading of equipment is envisioned and required (para. II (4).
1.07      Computer utilization has been steadily increasing reflecting both
the growth in staff and transactions in FELDA and an increased awareness and
use of data processing in research and analysis work. The January-April 1977
report shows an average utilization of 10.6 hours per day (44% of a full
three shift capacity). The May to August average is 12.6 hours per day
(52%). Just over half of this growth is due to new research and statistical
analysis work. The table below compares the two four month periods and
the distribution of time among the several systems.

1.08      Total production time increased by 361 hours (38%) in the May/August
period. Such incremental growth can be predicted to continue commensurate
with FELDA's growth, and to include support of the several corporations and
greater use of data processing for research, statistics and management
information needs.
II. UPDATE OF PREVIOUS REVIEW
2.01      The review of FELDA's financial and other systems included as
Annex 5 of the April 1977 Supervision Report noted problem areas, reported on
FELDA's proposed solutions and suggested terms of reference for outside
consultants to assist in the resolution of those problems. Substantial
action has been taken by FELDA in the intervening months to address the
points raised as shown below.
(1) Staff
2.02      The supervision report noted that DPD was understaffed in the
computer systems analyst category. Authority has since been given to add up
to four additional computer systems analysts and four additional programmers
beginning in October 1977, raising the complement of analysts and programmers
from 11 to 18. This appears to be adequate, especially for system design
needs.
2.03      An additional need is for upgrading data capture and preparation
strength (primarily keypunch capacity). For the period March through June,
the average monthly keypunch requirement was just over 12 million key strokes.
The average production from seven keypunch operators was just over 5.5 million
productive key strokes with the high being 7.5 million. DPD has been meeting
this deficiency in three ways: overtime, use of a service bureau, and
omitting verification in several of the systems. The latter has contributed
to the estimated 15% error rate in settler accounting records and to lags in
processing.
2.04      The average productive keypunch hours worked per employee day in
the March-June period was 4.54. These productivity rates should be improved
through upgrading of equipment, improved document submission, and use of
production standards.  Nevertheless, there will remain a staff deficiency.
Proposals for the 1978 budget now under consideration envision an increase in
productivity and staff barely sufficient to meet the 1977 demand levels. It
is likely that the 1978 demand will substantially exceed the 1977 level and a
deficiency is likely to be perpetuated at a continued cost of accuracy and
timeliness. Favorable consideration of the budget increase is warranted.
Periodic review and adjustment throughout the year would be advisable.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
(2) User departments involvement in systems development
2.05      It WEaS previously noted that user departments were not sufficiently
involved in systems development or changes with the result of patchwork
changes, high error rates in data capture, and untimely reporting. FELDA has
responded to th,is in part and plans further remedial action. DPD has forma-
lized the circularization of proposed changes and additions for comment by
user and affected departments and has instituted regular training sessions
fcr user departments. The Finance Department has placed pre-audit clerks in
several regions with marked improvement in the 'timeliness and accuracy of
source data reporting and will extend this decentralization of pre-audit to
all regions by the end of the year. DPD will, on a test basis, place keypunch
equipment in several regions although it does not seem feasible to consider
early extensive decentralization of data capture capability because of
personnel, training and environmental limitations. These actions taken by
FELDA will reduce considerably the error rate and time delay.
(3) Systems design problems
2.06      The suapervision report noted that the major financial systems
being used were designed for magnetic tape storage and processing with the
programs generally requiring the sort of sequential files and printing
reports or updalting files. New reports often require changes in, and recom-
piLation of, existing programs. The sequential file requirement does not
malce use of the advantages available in the computer configuration. The
report also noted that data were captured and used in only one system for a
limited purpose or report with resulting duplication of data and production
or the inability to reach data on file. An example of this was the then
separate payroll and personnel systems. Again, FELDA has acted to address
these problems. The payroll and personnel systems are now using a common
fi]le and work has begun on the development of a data bank. Most significant,
howiever, was FELDA's entering into a contract with a Malaysian consulting
firm (MIDFIC) to do the following:
(a)  revier existing computer based programs and develop effective
management information systems.
(b)  rationalize documentation used for the preparation of management
reports.
(c)  design a systems package for audit use (extraction and access
programs).
2.07      The details of the work plan proposed by the consultants and
accepted by FELDA are in substance consistent with the terms of reference
suggested by the supervision mission. The differences lie only in scope
in that the consultants' efforts will be restricted to FELDA and not to
Felmill and the other corporations. This is essentially a question of
time (see II (5) below).



ANNEX I
Page 5
2.08      The schedule calls for 22 man-months of effort.  Of this, the
rationalizaticr. of the management information and financial reporting
systems for existing FELDA users and the design of an auditing systems
package is projected to use eight man-months. Implementation and mon-
itoring will require up to 14 man-months.
2.09      This effort will be the first full system evaluation that has ever
been made. The terms of reference and the consultant capability to perform to
those terms within the time frame projected appear satisfactory.
(4) Hardware utilization
2.10      The supe-vision report noted a low computer utilization rate and
attributed this to an inadequate computer main memory or core size. This
required extra subroutines to be performed. Since that report, core size has
been increased from 156 K to 192 K. Section I discussed the growth in
utilization to 52% over the past four months and favorable future trends.
DPD sees further expansion of the core size to 256 K by 1980 and ultimately
to 356 K.
(5) Felmill systems
2.11      The supervision report raised several concerns about the
Felmill system which was in its initial stages of development. The first
concern was how the three package systems (general accounting, accounts
receivable and inventory) would interface for maximum computer efficiency.
The second was the nature of planning for additions to the systems and
the third was speculation whether, in view of the similarities between
the FELDA and Felmill general accounting systems, the two systems should
be merged or be made identical.
2.12      Progress on the Felmill system has been made but much more refine-
ment and rationalization must still be made. Interface among the three basic
systems has been established. Payroll distribution data have been entered
into the systems and a fixed asset system is installed. Additional potential
exists and is discussed in III (2).
2.13      The Felmill system is separate from the FELDA system.  Integration
of the systems is definitely not contemplated because of the separate
authorities existing, the different objectives and different cost centers.
2.14      The lessons learned from the consultants' review and rationalization
of the existing FELDA systems will be of considerable value and application
in evaluating and refining the basic Felmill systems and should be used in
such a fashion as soon as possible after completion of the consultants' work
and should be within the capability of the enlarged DPD professional staff.

III. ADDITIONAL FUTURE NEEDS
3.01      The following paragraphs set forth additional findings and recommen-
dations beyond those outlined in the supervision report and commented upon in
Section II. They set forth three areas to which FELDA should give high
priority. FELDA is aware of these needs but has not yet developed specific
timetables and action plans to deal with them. The good progress made by
FELDA in recent months on its annual work plan and in addressing previously
noted problems suggests a strong ability to accomplish what it sets out to do.
(1) Security, environment and space needs
3.02      The current physical setting for DPD falls substantially short of
adequacy in terms of space and security. Current housing of staff and equip-
ment cannot conceivably absorb the staff expansion planned and needed in the
immediate future. An interim alternative of placing DPD personnel in other
departments is inconsistent with principles of management control and even
that limited alternative will not allow for placing the planned additional
staff.
3.D3      An even more urgent and critical matter is that of security.  Access
to equipment, files and tapes is not effectively limited either by procedure
or facility. Fire protection is elemental and inadequate. Duplicate, separate
and secure master files, tapes and programs are only partially maintained.
SaEeguards against damage, loss, fraud and manipulation must include a safe
environment, backup support and a solid, well understood and enforceable
security plan.
(2) Future User Needs
3.04      Until very recently, the primary use of data processing capability
has been for conventional financial systems such as general accounting, payroll
ancd inventory. FELDA's basic systems are fairly well in place and are now
undlergoing evaluation. Felmill's basic financial systems are of more recent
origin and they would benefit from a similar review. The balance of the FELDA
related corporations perform the financial functions on a manual basis.
3.05      There has been a rapid, recent growth and interest in data processing
for research, statistical analysis and other management information in FELDA.
The appetite, need and potential for further Management Information System (MIS)
development are strong and are being progressively satisfied. The terms of
reference for the consultants under contract with FELDA include FELDA develop-
ment but do not extend to FELDA-related corporations, which is justified at
present. This report will therefore note only the need to plan for future MIS
support to the corporations.
3.06      Some of the specific needs which are common to FELDA and its
subsidiaries are fairly conventional and models are easy to obtain and
implement. Included in this category are such items as stock control systems,
vehicle maintenance and use analysis, debtor/creditor controls and contract
status reports.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
3.07      A further level of need is for unit cost data in Felmill.  It
would have been preferable to have established this in connection with the
general accounting system but this was not done. This will complicate its
development because of revisions that may be required to be made to the basic
systems. Other developing needs with potential for computer use will require
professional expertise likely beyond that found either in the data processing
staff or current corporate management. Such needs include models focusing on
price trend calculations and yield forecasts.
3.08      Successful development of these additional systems which go beyond
basic financial systems depends on sharp definition of factors and their
relationships, on management determination of priorities, need and use, on
management involvement in the development process and on the capacity of the
system to produce the desired result in a useful time frame.
3.09      There is a desire on the part of FELDA to continue development in
an incremental fashion. However, FELDA's managers have not yet established
clearly their priority needs nor made specific commitment of resources to
further MIS development. This is due to a heavy preoccupation with substan-
tially increased day-to-day operations in the several program areas. Finally,
the capacity of the DPD to absorb additional workload or to provide design
assistance has been limited by staff and equipment deficiencies, by some
inefficiencies in the present system and by lack of definitional relationships
with the corporate entities.
3.10      This report has noted the logical steps taken or planned to improve
staff and equipment capacity and to rationalize and perfect the existing
financial systems. The result should be that within a year the stage will
be set for expanded support to the several corporations. This leads to a
final recommendation.
(3) Service Bureau Concept
3.11      It would make sense now for FELDA to move to establish DPD on a
self-supporting, service bureau basis in which costs of systems design,
programming and processing are recaptured by charges to user departments,
since there is sufficient historical experience now to establish valid fee
schedules. The service bureau concept has several obvious advantages:
- it permits establishing cost/benefit tests to be applied to MIS
and therefore acts as a screening device against high cost/low
yield reports;
- it more truly distributes operations costs and therefore gives
management a better perspective on operational efficiency;
- it provides greater flexibility to the DPD to expand or contract
its operations on an income basis associated with demand;



ANNEX I
Page 8
- it demands that operational managers plan for and commit resources
in an orderly rather than inspirational basis;
- it places stress on the data processing department to be cost-
conscious and efficient and permits cost comparisons to be made with
outside service bureau rates.

MALAYSIA
FELDA VI LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
THE ECOLOGY
Background
1.        FELDA's land development activities have been conducted with barely
any negative impact on the ecology. Typically FELDA's contractors clear
virgin forests manually, with a minimum disturbance of the soil after licensees
extract all the marketable timber. The felled trees are subsequently burnt,
the cover crops are immediately established to control weeds and erosion and
the rubber or oil palm seedlings are planted subsequently. The foliage cover
and root systems of trees in the planted area are substantially developed in
2 to 4 years for oil palms and in 5 to 6 years for rubber and ensure condi-
tions very similar to those prevailing before development took place. As a
result water runoff, soil erosion, and siltation are minimized. FELDA also
leaves under primary forests all those areas that: a) are in the upper levels
of water catchment basins; b) contain steep slopes; and c) have rich wild
animal life. Additionally, these areas are protected by FELDA from illegal
operators. In summary, FELDA's land development is carried out without
detriment to the ecology.
2.        Since 1967 FELDA has also developed facilities for processing
settlers produce. It has brought into operation 19 palm oil mills with a
present capacity of about 750 tons ffb per hour, and is in the process of
either building or expanding five mills per year. FELDA also has built 3
rubber factories with a present capacity of 127 tons per day and is building
another factory with a 42 ton per day capacity. Of the oil mills, ten have
been, or are being, built and one has been expanded, with IBRD financing
under the previous five FELDA loans.
3.        From 1967 to 1970 the expansion of palm oil processing facilities
by FELDA and private companies all over Malaysia was carried out without much
regard for its ecological impact. By 1970, however, the pollution effects of
oil effluents had become evident and private industry research was started.
In the intervening years a new sense of urgency has developed in response to
what appears to be a problem of major proportions.
4.        A Bank's Urban Development mission reviewed the urban development
aspects of the FELDA - sponsored Keratong project in May/June, 1977. The
mission was highly critical of what appeared to be FELDA's poor efforts in
pollution control. This became an issue, i.e. whether any more Bank financing
should be made available to FELDA without the latter's firm commitment to
pollution control and without a pollution control project component.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
Palm Oil Effluent: Control
5.        Of all polluters in less developed countries palm oil mills seems
to be the worst by any standard. As stated in the guidelines of the Bank's
Office of Environmental and Health Affairs, "the Biological Oxygen Demand
(BOD), i.e., the quality of oxygen utilized for the biochemical oxidation of
waste, of the untreated effluent is about 20,000 to 30,000 parts per million
(ppml) per liter./i Such a load of oxygen demand creates havoc among the
flora and fauna of rivers and canals. If the free oxygen in the water cannot
be replaced the oxidation is only partial and creates compounds with a foul
odor."
6.        Government enacted the Environmental Quality Act in 1974 setting
the problem in perspective and providing general guidelines. This was
followed by the Regulations promulgated in late 1977. The Regulations estab-
lish: a) the licensing by the Ministry of all palm oil processing facilities
in the country; b) the specification by the Ministry of points of waste
discharge for each such facility; and c) quarterly reporting to the Ministry
by each processing facility giving details of ffb processed, palm oil produced,
total and maximum waste discharge over a 24 hour period, as well as temperature,
ph, BOD, COD, (chlemical oxygen demand), total solids, suspended solids, oil
and grease, ammorLiacal nitrogen, and total nitrogen measurements.
7.        The Regulations and related circulars also establish maximum BOD
concentration allowable as follows: 5,000 ppm by June 30, 1978; 2,000 ppm by
June! 30, 1979; and 500 ppm by June 30, 1980.  Stiff penalties are prescribed
for those who do not comply.
8.        An industry-wide symposium was conducted in Kuale Lumpur in early
October 1977. A number of research and experimentation findings were dis-
cussed and the neted to find ways of meeting the BOD standards prescribed by
the regulations was emphasized. A M$10 million fund was established for
experimentation in calendar 1978.
9.        Tentative physical and economic analysis have shown the following
methods to be presently unattractive:  a) dehydration, because it requires a
very expensive plant and involves high energy costs; b) collection and
spraying over large plantation areas because it would require up to 100
ten-ton trucks per plant, which is both prohibitively expensive and logis-
tically a nightmare; and c) chemical flocculation and fermentation because
the cost of the plant would roughly equal the cost of the oil mill itself.
/1 This is about 100 times the concentration present in raw municipal
sewage.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
10.       The most generalized way to control oil effluents up to the present
consists of settling lagoons established in natural depressions or excavated
mechanically where mill effluent is allowed to settle for up to a few weeks.
The resulting crust of solids formed on the surface is mechanicaily removed
(which lowers BOD concentration by about one half) and the solids in suspen-
sion are allowed to run off into nearby streams. This, although very cheap,
is clearly inadequate, since it still leaves 50% of BOD concentration to be
spewed into waterways. A variant of this is to spread the untreated or
anaerobically treated (much more preferable) effluent over land under con-
trolled conditions and with proper supervision. These have been authorized
temporarily by the Ministry.
11.       The most promising approach for the future consists of deep anaerobic
(up to 15 feet) ponds coupled with mechanical removal of surface solids for
field application taking advantage of topography. This is followed by aerobic
treatment in shallow ponds, which can be further improved by: (a) prior
mechanical aeration in cylinders or ditches; (b) injection of raw sludge to
accelerate oxidation of the effluent; and (c) algae treatment for further BOD
reduction. All of these represent substantial improvements in effluent
treatment.
12.       The general consensus is that the Regulations' targets through 1980
can be physically and economically met using combinations of the methods
outlined above. It is widely expected that by 1980 supplementary methods
will have been developed to reduce BOD further to less than 100 ppm, which
would be an acceptable ultimate target. The soil fertilizing and soil
conditioning capabilities of oil effluent should make these and other methods
more economically attractive.
FELDA's Palm Oil Effluent Control
13.       FELDA's participation in oil pollution control efforts dates back
to the early 1970's and have been strengthened markedly in the last two
years. These efforts can be grouped as follows: a) field experimentation at
the Tun Razah Research Station and mill in Jerantut; b) a pilot project with
the Department of Chemistry using bench laboratory testing combined with
field experimentation; and c) exchange of research results with private
industry.  FELDA's management is fully aware of the importance of oil pollu-
tion control and is firmly committed to compliance with the Regulations
through 1980 and beyond. The latest method being tested at present in
FELDA's Trolak Mill is depicted in the flow chart of the Attachment.
Rubber Effluent Control
14.       The Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM) began experimenting
with rubber effluent treatment in the early 1970s. By 1974 research showed



ANNEX 2
Page 4
that anaerobic ponding for 8 days followed by aerobic ponding for 7 days
reduced BOD from the original 1.500 ppm (block rubber) to 100 ppm at
relatively low cost. This method also reduced COD by 85%, volatile solids by
70%, and ammoniacal nitrogen by 40%. A later addition was a healthy bloom of
green algae in the stabilization (aerobic) system.
1.5.      The daily output of an average size block rubber factory is about
20 tons (16 tons of latex rubber and 4 tons of cup lump rubber). The effluent
generated is estimated at 410,000 liters. It has been proven that treatment
requires only 24 days of ponding in 0.65 ha containing 9,800 cu m of effluent,
which is feasible both physically and economically. A further recent improve-
ment is the addition of a rubber trap large enough to hold effluent for 8
hours, which can remove about two thirds of solids prior to passage to the
anaerobic pond. Part of the cost of the rubber trap can be met from the sale
of rubber collected from the trap.
16.       The above treatment is also applicable to treat effluent of concen-
trated latex factories (which has 5/10,000 ppm BOD) with the previous ph
reduction to about 9 (for N removal) and the addition of an oxidation ditch.
Using rotors and 50% sludge recirculation, these reduce BOD concentration by
99% (to less than 40 ppm). The land area required is at least double that for
crumb rubber effluents, but this is still quite manageable.
17.       FELDA has been following the above methods for some years now.  They
are effective in minimizing the negative ecological impact of rubber effluents.
