PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
OMAN
FIRST HI.HWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT - LOAN 1441-OM
PREFACE
This project completion report describes the preparation and imple-
mentation of the First Highway Maintenance Project for which Loan 1441-OM of
US$15.0 million was approved in May, 1977. The project was planned to be com-
pleted in September, 1981 but was not fully disbursed until May, 1985 mainly
because of the design changes of the workshops. There were no cost overruns
and the project met its objectives.
The report was prepared by the Transportation Division of the Europe,
Middle East and North Africa Projects Department. It is based on a study of
information in the project file, supervision missions, and the cooperation of
the Oman authorities and its consultants in providing the necessary data.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments; their reply is shown as
Annex 6.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
OMAN
FIRST HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT LOAN 1441-OM
HIGHLIGHTS
This project was the first Bank lending operation in Oman's transport
sector following the Education Project (Ln. 980-OM) 1974, and the Technical
Assistance Loan (985-OM) 1974, which included transport sector studies and
helped to identify this project.
Salient points arising from the project were:
(i)    an effective training program was established for Omani staff of
the Directorate General of Roads ..(DGR) and the first stage
training center was completed: most of these staff trained
(about 90%) remain with the DGR (para. 3.04);
(ii)    technical  and economic  project evaluation  methodologies  were
introduced and their use demonstrated in the preparation of the
1981-85 Five Year Plans for Highway Tnvestment and Highway
Maintenance (para. 3.04);
(iii)    the technical assistance component together with workshop con-
struction made the first critical step forward in promoting an
effective program  for and Government commitment  to effective
highway maintenance (para. 3.05);
(iv)    the development of a modern, self-sustaining highway management
department is a lengthy and gradual procedure and often will
take much longer than has been estimated at appraisal; technical
assistance in particular should be planned over a long term
(para. 3.02); and
(v)    Since May 1985 the authorities have the power to control axle
loads so as not to exceed the highway system's design limits.
The introduction of appropriate legislation was undertaken
within the regional framework of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(para. 3.06).



(vi)
In an active partnership between the Bank and the Oman Government,
useful progress has been made in laying the foundations for an effective high-
way maintenance system and highway planning strategy.   The project was an
important first step in developing self-sustaining institutions for implement-
ing transport sector strategy but it will clearly be some time before Oman
will be able to rely entirely on its own resources. Until then active Bank
participation through project supervision and advice will be an important
technical assistance input.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SULTANATE OF OMAN
FIRST HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT - LOAN 1441-OH
I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.01     Since 1970 Oman has experienced rapid economic growth initiated by an
enlightened Government and sustained by growing oil revenues.  It should be
recorded in this context, however, that although the per capita income was
growing at 3.82 per annum between 1970 and 1979 the per capita capital stock
started from a very low base and even though the 1983 per capita income was
estimated at US$6090 the per capita capital stock is still low.
1.02     Road transport is the major mode of domestic transport in Oman and is
of growing importance in commercial and social relations with neighboring
countries of the Gulf Region. The road system consists of a paved network
which is dense in the capital area around Muscat and links most of the main
towns.  In 1984 it amounted to 3,267 km compared with 10 km in 1970.  The ne'-
work of tracks and gravel roads increased from about 1,700 km to 9,748 km dur-
ing the same period. The vehicle fleet has grown from an estimated 31,500 in
1975 to about 180,000 in 1984, an annual growth rate of about 21%, and the
size and weight of commercial vehicles has also increased.
1.03     The World Bank assisted the Government in reviewing highway syst-m
needs as part of a technical assistance project (Loan 985-OH) and since then
has participated in two highway maintenance projects, Loan 1441-OM which is
the subject of this report and Loan 2084-OH which is ongoing with anticipated
completion in December 1985. A Third Highway Maintenance Project was ap-
praised in December 1984.



-2-
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Preparation
2.01     At the request of the Government in 1972, the World Bank prepared a
technical assistance project to finance studies of the needs of the
agricultural and transport sectors. The project, Loan 985-OM, was approved by
the Board in April 1974. Consultants were employed and they identified as a
major need the establishment of an effective highway maintenance organization
and strategy together with a program for training Omani highway personnel.
Based on this study and with Government's support, the First Highway
Maintenance Project was prepared and appraised in January, 1977. This was the
first Bank financed project in Oman's transport sector.
B. Project Objectives
2.02     The World Bank recognized in the early 1970's that, although Oman was
developing its wealth rapidly, the absence of adequate skilled manpower at all
levels and in most non-oil sectors was going to create major operational and
developmental bottlenecks. Consequently, the Bank's lending strategy, which
encompassed the Highway Sector, focussed on the need to supply technical
assistance and to encourage institution building whilst providing an important
transfer of resources.  This has continued to be the strategy context in the
Second and proposed Third Highway Maintenance Projects.
2.03     As part of this strategy the consultants to the Roads Department (RD)
of the Ministry c& Communication (MC) employed under Loan 985-OM, developed
the Maintenance, Training, Technical Assistance Program which provided the
basis for  the First Hight:Ay Maintenance  Project.   The objectives  of  the
project were:
(a) to provide immediate physical and manpower resources to assist
the Government in planning, implementing improvements and in
particular maintaining the highway system;
(b) to plan and to implement a training program in order to train
Omani staff in highway maintenance operations; and
(c) to introduce modern highway planning techniques and data col-
lection systems, including highway maintenance cost accounting,
to support these techniques.



-3-
C. Project Appraisal
2.04     The project was appraised in January, 1977.  It covered a three year
tranche, 1978-80, of Oman's 1978-82 Highway Maintenance Plan.l'  The project
components were:
(a)  procurement of highway maintenance equipment and spares;
(b)  construction and operation of highway maintenance workshops2'
including equipment and spares;
(c) the construction and operation of a Roads Department training
center including a three-year staff training program;
(d  fuel and lubricants for routine highway maintenance;
(e)  soils laboratory, survey and commurications equipment; and
(f) consultants services to (i) establish and manage the routine
highway maintenance program; (ii) establish and implement a com-
prehensive    training    program    for   Omani    staff;    and
(iii) strengthen the administrative, planning and operational
capabilities of the Roads Department.
l/ The Plan was subsequently -changed to cover the period through 1980 with a
new five year plan starting in 19P1.

existing workshop at Haima.

III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01     Implementation of the project, though on the whole satisfactory, was
slower than anticipated due primarily to four factors:
-    the project was the first Bank-financed project in this sector,
and the learning process and unfamiliarity with Bant guidelines
and procedures slowed project implementation;
-    on recruitment, Oman has a high security profile which tends to
slow down the approval of the technical assistance candidates;
-    budgeting  regulations atre very strict and this, whilst being
useful for financial discipline, hampers the response to program
modifications; and
-    in 1980, although the major part of the Project had been com-
pleted, a revision was made to the design of workshops at Ibri,
A'zaiba, Salalah, and Al-Ghaliel in order to improve working
conditions. This required an extra phase of design, tendering,
supply and construction which caused a major slow-down in dis-
bursements during the period 1980 to 1984 (see Figure 1).
3.02     Four important lessons are highlig!ited:
(a)  the development of a modern self-sustaining highway management
department will take much longer than was originally anticipated
and technical assistance in particular should be planned over a
long term;
(b)  there will be a changing emphasis in the type of work that has
to be carried out as the road system evolves: more attention
will eventually have to be paid to periodic maintenance and
pavement strengthening, and solutions will have to be found for
meeting very heavy traffic demands associated with the urban
areas;
(c)  regional characteristics should be taken into account in design-
ing the  training program:   the needs of the Southern Region
based on Salalah require particular attention, even to the
extent of establishing a Southern training center; and
(d)  effective highway maintenance planning can only take place given
a reliable cost data base and this required greater efforts to
be made to establish a sound cost accounting system in the Roads
Department: this in particular is being followed up under the
Second Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 2084-OM).
3.03     There has ben, however,  a noticeable improvement in the speed of
project implementation during the Second Highway Project (Loan 2084-ON) indi-
cating that Omani personnel are becoming more experienced in working with the
Bank and are developing their technical and administrative skills and under-
standing of Bank procedures.



- 5 -
3.04     The Project's technical assistance components, for which two firms of
consultants were employed, one to operate the maintenance management and the
training program and one to provide engineering assistance, were satisfacto-
rily implemented. Comprehensive Five Year Plans for 1981-1985 covering high-
way investment and maintenance were prepared and as part of this, the economic
evaluation of highway projects and maintenance were introduced.  Appropriate
training courses were designed and the Training Center was built and staffed,
although progress in training was relatively slow until the Second Highway
Project started.  The training program centered on teaching basic skills and
upgrading already partly-trained employees.  About 90% of the 275 employees
trained under the project were still employed by the Directorate General of
Roads in 1984. Maintenance management, highway planning and training activi-
ties are being satisfactorily and energetically continued under the Second
Highway Maintenance Project and are recommended for the proposed Third Highway
Maintenance Project.  Both firms of consultants performed satisfactorily but
one performed particularly well and has been retained under the Second Highway
Maintenance Project to cover all aspects of technical assistance thus provid-
ing continuity.
3.05     The program of road maintenance workshop construction and procurement
of maintenance equipment was satisfactorily implemented. The work centres and
workshops, together with the strong technical assistance component, have per-
mitted an improved level of routine maintenance to be carried out by the DGR's
direct labour units. This work has included regravelling and grading, includ-
ing reshaping, minor patching and repairs of asphalt surfaces, shoulder main-
tenance, drainage, side-slopes, road signs and markings. The thrust of the
project, which was to carry out this work over the 6425 km network for which
the DGR was responsible in 1978, was successfully achieved. Adequate finance
was made available (see Annex 3) and averaged about US$1,000 km p.a. in 1978.
Moreover, maintenance resources have continued to keep pace in real terms with
the growth in the DGR road network. This success has, in turn, stimulated
interest in highway maintenance at local level and within central government.
However, as the highway system is expanded and upgraded and the maintenance
i-qtitutions are developed to keep pace with this, the need for improved
f *ilities, including workshops, and work centers will also grow. Hence, the
h-ghway maintenance infrastructure facilities completed within the project
should be considered ao more than a first stage in a longer term program.
3.06     Two objectives, however, were not reached within the duration of the
First Project:
(i)    Axle Load Control:  The Omani traffic ordinance, while governing
vehicle dimensions, only recently (May 1985) started to regulate
vehicle weights and axle loads, although control of these was
required in the Loan Agreement.  A Government letter has also
been sent in 1985 to all vehicle importers requiring them not to
import vehicles that do not conform to certain maximum weight
limits, which are based on Omani pavement and bridge design



-6-
criteria.   The  Gulf  Cooperation  Councill'  is  currently  at-
tempting to introduce regional vehicle construction and use reg-
ulations, which will include controls on axle loads, and the new
Omni legislation has been framed to conform to regional recom-
mendations; and
(ii)    Materials Testing:  Although some soils testing equipment has
been procured under the project there are as yet no adequate
Roads Department materials testing facilities.  Such materials
testing that is carried out by the consultants on behalf of the
Roads Department, is undertaken by borrowing facilities from one
or  two contractors.   This  is not  a  satisfactory  situation,
especially if greater use is to be made of locally available
materials, and the proposed Third Highway Maintenance Project
aeeks to correct it through constructing, equipping and staffing
a comprehensive testing laboratory.
3.07     The Loan Closing Date was extended from September 1981 to June 1984
and full disbursement of the loan was delayed from June 1981 to May 1985 to
cover disbursements for commitments made prior to the revised Closing Date.
The project delays stemmed principally from delay in getting water and elec-
tricity to workshop sites and subsequently, modifications which were required
to be made to the original design of workshops to improve protection from
Oman's harsh weather conditions.   The modifications entailed the design of
stiffeners for the main steel structures to counteract increased wind loadings
with supplementary procurement for the additional protective works.  It took
some considerable time to agree guarantee arrangements between the original
supplier and the new cladding contractor. Slow familiarization with Bank pro-
cedures for appointment of consultants, procurement and reimbursement and
slower than expected start and build-up of consultants services (mostly due to
lengthy administrative and recruitment processes) also contributed to the
delay.
3.08     The disbursement profile is given in Annex 1 and Figure 1.  Delays
have essentially occurred as a result of project component redesign and
lengthy administrative processes, which are being addressed in the Second
Project.
1/ The Gulf Cooperation Council is a regional political and economic grouping
of six states, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United
Arab Emirates; through the agreement of its Council of Ministers (repre-
senting individual states) it has the authority to take and enforce cer-
tain actions including regional legislation.

IV. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
4.01     The appraisal indicated that the routine maintenance program which
was to be supported by the project would yield benefit:cust ratios of between
5.8:1 to 6.0:1 depending on the discount rate used in the calculations   The
rate of return was estimeted at 44%. Without base data on the original road
surface condition and traffic flows supplemented by major field-work to re-
measure conditions and to undertake traffic counts, detailed recalculation is
not possible.  The absence of reliable traffic counts except for major high-
ways and also the currently sketchy information on the distribution of mainte-
nance funds by class of road, is an important planning and control deficiency
which is being addressed under the ongoing Second Highway Project and the pro-
posed Third Highway Project. Nonetheless, the annual growth in Oman traffic
during the project has been about 15% for light vehicles and 101 for medium
and heavy vehicles and the routine maintenance program has been generally
satisfactorily implemented and there is no reason to suspect that final eco-
nomic benefits will be less than estimated at appraisal.
4.02     The table at Annex 3 shows the estimated real growth in routine main-
tenance together with the appraisal estimate of needs for 1978 to 1982. This
comparison indicates that allocated maintenance funds were of the right
magnitude. Furthermore, whilst the paved road system and the graded gravel
road system have expanded by about 142 p.a. and 61 p.a. respectively during
the period 1976 to 1984 at the same time the real routine maintenance budget
has grown at about 14% p.a., thus more than keeping pace with the growth in
the maintained highway system. However, it is not possible to evaluate the
effect of the parallel growth in traffic (also between 10 and 15%) and conse-
quently an accurate assessment of the adequacy of the routine maintenance bud-
get cannot yet be made, and must await the improvement of the data base.
Nevertheless, it is clear that the need for highway maintenance is supported
by the Omani technical and financial authorities.
4.03     Any attempt to evaluate the benefits derived from improved highway
maintenance in Oman during the period in question is going to be obscured by
the very large increase in the kilometrage of paved roads which carry the bulk
of traffic. Thus, the examples given below are only indicative of what the
reevaluated benefits cost ratio would be based on certain assumptions.
Paved Roads - The assumptions are:
(i)    original traffic flow of 2,000 vpd with 60% cars, 201 light com-
mercial and 201 trucks with a 10% p.a. growth rate: the average
flow on Oman paved roads is estimated at just over 3000
vehicles/day although the distribution is highly skewed;
(ii)    in the absence of routine maintenance a deterioration in condi-
tion and hence vehicle operating costs (voc) from 1.00 to 1.25
over five years: although this may seem rather rapid deteriora-
tion, the occasional but very severe rains and resulting erosion
could have this effect;
(iii)    annual "ideal" routine maintenance cost of OR 850 per km; and



- 8 -
(iv)    Base vehicle operating costs in 1984 prices on level, tangential
and good pavement condition roads as given in Annex 4.
Using these data and assumptions and applying a discount factor of 152, the
benefit:cost ratio over a five-year maintenance period 1979-83 is 7.84.
Gravel Roads - The assumptions are:
(i)    original traffic flow 400 vpd consisting of 40b cars, 40% light
commercial vehicles and 20% trucks with an annual growth rate of
10X; 400 vpd may be high for an average figure but some recent
sample counts in the region around the Capital Area indicate
flows of over 1000 vpd on some gravel roads;
(ii)    in the absence of maintenance (including an element of regravel-
ling) a deterioration in condition and hence voc from 1.0 to
2.14 over a five year period;
(iii)    annual  "ideal"  maintenance  cost,  including  regravelling  as
needed, OR 1,000; and
(iv)    base vehicle operating costs from Annex 4.
Based on these data and assumptions and applying a discount factor of 15%, the
benefit:cost ratio over the five year maintenance period is 9.40, exceeding
appraisal  estimates.   The overall benefit:cost ratio is estimated at 9.00
which clearly demonstrates the project's economic viability with a rate of
return greater than that estimated at appraisal. Even assuming a reduction in
benefits of 50Z (lower traffic flows and lower rate of deterioration in the
"do nothing" case) the project would still have achieved rate of return
similar to that estimated at appraisal.
4.04     Under the proposed Third Highway Maintenance Project it is intended
to (a) introduce a modern pavement management system,; (b) carry out objective
assessments of pavement conditions; and (c) develop the highway maintenance
cost accounting system; and this will permit the authorities to carry out an
in depth analysis of the efficiency of the maintenance program and the evalu-
ation of alternative strategies.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
5.01     The project was satisfactorily implemented and significant progress
was made towards achieving the goal of introducing for the first time a modern
and dynamic highway maintenance system to a country. The delay of more than
three and a half years in completion was largely due to design changes of
workshops. By the original closing date (9/30/81), already 76Z of the loan
was disbursed (Annex 1). When dealing with sector administrations unfamiliar
with Bank procedures, special provision for technical assistance and training
should be made. Guidance to the borrower's project staff in the required
administrative skills and Bank procedures during project preparation and
implementation also need to be provided. Whilst this was attempted under the
project, more efforts should have been made in this direction including a
shor; procurement seminar following appraisal or negotiations.
5.02     Taking account of the basic level of institutional development, prog-
ress towards achieving a self-sustaining maintenance operation will be slow
and will require support, especially technical assistance, for some time. The
training program is working well but it will be several years, before Oman
will be able to supply most of its manpower needs in the highway sector espe-
cially at professional level.
5.03     There is a clear need in the early stages of sector development to
institute and to maintain the effective collection and storage of essential
data, in this case especially highway inventory and traffic data and costing
of engineering operations. Without these data a modern planning and implemen-
tation system cannot be properly effective and technical assistance inputs
will not yield their full potential.
5.04     In addition to continuing the drive towards achieving the objective
of a self-sustaining and efficient maintenance system, including support
infrastructure such as modern maintenance bases and adequate materials testing
facilities, the examination of the First Highway Maintenance Project identi-
fies the need to follow up on the question of vehicle axle loads. Either
limits should be established, given the backing of law and enforced, or, pave-
ment design standards should be employed that can cater for high axle loads,
and the road users should contribute equitably for the incremental construc-
tion costs. The proposed Third Highway Project should address this matter in
the context of regional proposals.
The World Bank Role and Contribution
5.05     While the Bank's financial assistance was clearly welcomed the main
contribution has been, and remains, in the development of a rational institu-
tional structure to (a) support periodic and routine maintenance planning and
implementation; (b) undertake long term highway planning for both maintenance
and investments; (c) make greater use of modern project evaluation techniques
in establishing priorities and (d) develop an appropriate training program
that will gradually reduce Oman's dependence on expatriate personnel. It is
clear that active Bank supervision is welcomed, serves a very useful function
and should eventually evolve into a strong technical assistance program.
