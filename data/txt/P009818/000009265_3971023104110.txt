CAMBAY BASIN PETROLEUM PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:             Government of India (GOI)
Beneficiary:          Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC)
Amount:                U$242.5 million equivalent (including capitalized
front-end fee of 0.25x)
Lending Terms:        Repayable over 20 years, including five years of grace
at the standard variable interest rate.
On-Lending Terms:     Government of India (GOI) to ONGC (US$242.5 million):
Funds wilI be onlent to ONGC at a rate of at least 12X
per annum; repayment over a maximum of 15 years,
including five years' grace. GOI would bear the foreign
exchange and interest rate risks.
Project Description:  The purpose of the project would be to assist the Oil
and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) in developing its
capabilities for optimizing the production of existing,
mature oil fields-a new area of technology for India's
fledgling oil industry. The project comprises the
preparation and implementation of a US$954 million
investment program for increasing the production of oil
and gas from the onshore Cambay Petroleum Basin located
in the State of Gujarat in western India.
Specifically, assistance would be provided in
(i) exploration - to delineate, by seismic survey
and drilling, the limits of the known producing
zones; (ii) development and production - to sub-
stantially increase the production of both oil and
gas; (iii) enhanced oil recovery - to test alter-
native technologies for increasing recoverable
reserves; and (iv) technical assistance and train-
ing to ensure that ONGC staff acquire the requi-
site skills to successfully implement the new
methodologies.
The principal project risks are those normally
associated with petroleum exploration and
development, i.e., geological and technological.
The geological risks include the possibility that
oil will not be found in commercial quantities in
the deeper zones to be explored. The technology
being irtroduced under the project is a blend of
proven, profitable and -leading edge- technology

in such proportions, and with adequate foreign
technical assistance and training, that the risks
- both economic and environmental - are acceptable
under all reasonably expected adverse scenarios.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government of India (GOI) has requested a Bank loan of US$ 242.5
million equivalent for a petroleum project in the Cambay Basin (the project)
located in the State of Gujurat (IBRD Map. No. 17604). The project will be
implemented by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC), the national oil
company. The main objectives of the project are to: (i) increase oil and gas
production by about 2 million tons of oil equivalent per year representing
about 12% of 1982/83 petroleum imports; (ii) implement enhanced oil recovery
(EOR) pilot schemes; and (iii) explore the petroleum potential of deep
horizons and the unexplored area in the Gulf of Cambay. These objectives are
expected to be achieved by improving ONGC's technical and operational
capabilities in drilling and production. Improvements will come partly
through training and technical assistance and partly through a shift from
force account drilling to contracting.
1.02     The total financing required for the project, which accounts for
about 60% of the Cambay Basin investments and about 5% of ONGC's 'verall
investment program during 1984/85-1989/90, is estimated at US$954 million (Rs
9.5 billion) including about US$546 million (Rs 5.5 billion) in foreign
exchange.  In addition to the proposed Bank loan, ONGC will seek export,
buyers' and suppliers' credits for the project; it will also seek during the
project implementation period, commercial bank loans for part of its total
corporate investments. Part of such borrowings will be utilized in the
proposed project.  The total co-financing is expected to be about US$245
million. The balance of the financing required will be provided by ONGC.
1.03     The Bank has indicated for some time its interest in reviewing ONGC's
onshore operations. Thus, in late 1981, ONGC first mentioned to the Bank the
idea of undertaking some pilot enhanced oil recovery schemes for the heavy oil
fields in the northern section of the Cambay Basin. Subsequently, the
dialogue between ONGC and Bank staff expanded to include the full evaluation
of the petroleum production potential of this mature basin as well as the
operational and technological priorities to rapidly increase production,
modernize operations, and develop a program of optimal oil and gas recovery in
the basin. During the course of discussions about ONGC's exploration and
investment program in 1982, the concept of a project addressing the main
operational and technical problems, as well as the major exploration and
development investment opportunities, in the Cambay Basin was developed.
Following an identification mission and a preappraisal missiou in March 1983
and July 1983, respectively, the project was appraised in September 1983 by a
mission consisting of Messrs. Denis T. Carpio (Chief), Hannachi Morsli, Jean-
Paul Pinard, Stephen Tisza and Akin Oduolowu of the Energy Department and Mr.
Ted Geffen (EOR consultant).
II. - TEE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Energy Resources and Consumption
2.01     Commercial primary energy (coal, oil, gas, hydro and nuclear power)
accounts for about 46% of total energy consumption in India, with the balance
(54%) being derived from non-commercial sources such as firewood and
agricultural and animal wastes. Over the past ten years, the growth of energy



-2-
consumption in India averaged 4% per annum, which was marginally below GDP
growth for the period. Over the same period, commercial energy consumption
increased by 5.3% per annum. Per capita consumption of commercial primary
energy is about 166 kg of oil equivalent, which is half the average for low-
income developing countries. The share of oil products and natural gas in
India's commercial primary energy consumption, at about 33%, is low for a
developing country, primarily because of the significant use of coal in power
generation. Firewood is the most widely consumed fuel in Indta, accounting
for about 65% of total non-commercial energy consumption. Other sources of
fuel, such as vegetable and animal wastes, account for the remaining 35% of
non-commercial energy consumption. The energy supply in India by primary
energy sources is shown in Annex 2.1 and is summarized below.

2.02     Coal is the most abundant indigenous energy resource and the main
domestic source of commerjcal primary energy in India with reserves estimated
at about 85 billion tons - equal to about 42 billion tons of oil equivalent
(toe), 25 billion tons (about 12 billion toe) of which are proven reserves.
Most of the coal is of low to medium quality (3,500 to 5,000 kcal/kg) and is
primarily used for power generation. Coal production, which stagnated between
1976/77 and 1979/80 because of power shortages, delays in commissioning new
mines, labor difficulties and transportation bottlenecks, has risen
substantially from about 104 million tons in 1979/80 to 131 million tons in
1982/83, making India the sixth largest coal producer in the world. However
coal production is still about 4 million tons per year less than demand.
2.03     Based on the proven coal and hydro resources, India possesses the
potential to increase its power generating capacity. However, due to low
capacity utilization, delay in commissioning new thermal plants, lack of
essential spare parts for timely maintenance, and poor management, the supply
of power has consistently been less than potential demand in recent years. In
1980/81, the estimated deficit (calculated as actual supply compared to
potential unrestricted demand) was about 13% despite a growth in power
generation of 9% in the same year. If the government can successfully
overcome these problems, power generation capacity could reach 50,900MW in
1984/85 and, from 1988/89 onwards, the country's overall average electrical
energy requirements may be satisfied, although a peak capacity deficit and
regional imbalances would most likely continue until the mid-1990s.
2.04     India also possesses significant reserves of natural gas both onshore
and offshore. Proven gas reserves, mostly offshore, are estimated at about
410 billion cubic meters (or 330 million toe), equivalent to about 41% of
total estimated hydrocarbon reserves. Gas resources are not yet widely
utilized due to lack of market development. However, the importance of gas as
an energy source in the industrial sector to substitute for oil is increasingly
recognized by the government which is now making concerted efforts to
accelerate exploration and development of gas resources (para 3.01).
B. Investments in The Energy Sector
2.05     The energy sector claims a large and increasing share of public
investment in India, reflecting the growing concern that inadequate energy
supplies may become a serious constraint to economic development. Direct real
investment in the power, coal and oil subsectors as a whole grew at an average
annual rate of 15% between 1974/75 and 1980/81, while its share in total
outlay increased from about 18% in the Third Five-Year Plan to about 27% in
the current Sixth Five-Year Plan. This is a major commitment and should
accelerate the exploration for and development of India's energy resources.
Although the power subsector continues to receive the major share of funds
allocated to the energy sector, direct investment in the coal and oil
subsectors have increased three to four times between 1974/75 and 1980/81.
1/ These are for reserves in seams greater than 1.2 metres thick and at a
depth of less than 600 metres.



- 4 -
2.06     The size and rapid growth of investment in all energy subsectors,
especially in power and petroleum, reflect GOI's determined efforts to
minimize the adverse economic effects of energy shortages on the one hand, and
large oil import bills on the other. Stepped-up investment in this sector has
resulted in significant increases in energy production. Domestic crude
production has more than doubled from about 8 million tons in 1974/75 to about
21 million tons in 1982/83. Coal production has also increased by over 30%
between 1979/80 and 1982/83, while installed capacity in the power sector
(utilities) has increased by more than 75% over the past seven years.
Nevertheless, inadequate supply of energy has remained a major constraint to
India's economic growth. Although considerable indigenous energy resources
exist their development has not kept pace with demand; efforts to meet the
energy demand of the economy from domestic sources must still be intensified
and made a national priority, notwithstanding the encouraging progress made
recently in increasing oil production. The momentum of energy investments
needs to be maintained in the coal and oil/gas subsectors, and substantially
incredsed in the power sector, in order to eliminate power shortages and
prevent the re-emergence of coal shortages by the early 1990s as well as
reduce oil imports to a more manageable level of say 30% to 35% of domestic
demand. This would mean that the energy sector should continue to absorb a
large share of India's investment resources in future development plans.
2.07     The sectoral distribution of energy consumption is shown in Annex
2.2. Industry and transport together account for about 79% of total
commercial energy consumption, households 11%, agriculture 6% and all other
sectors the remaining 4%, respectively. The industrial sector is the largest
(55%) user of commercial energy, accounting for about 75% of coal, 63% of
electricity and 19% of petroleum consumption, respectively. The transport
sector is the next largest (24%) user of commercial energy, accounting for
about 53% of petroleum and 16% of coal consumption, respectively. The
household sector accounts for a relatively small share of commercial energy
consumption (7% of coal, 19% of petroleum and 10% of electricity).
2.08     The Government is aware that policies and actions are needed for both
energy demand management and development of local energy resources. Since
1979 several studies have been undertaken to address both areas and some
specific policy decisions and action programs have evolved from these
studies. Some of those pertaining to petroleum are discussed in the following
chapter.
III. - PETROLEUM SUBSECTOR
A. Petroleum Resources, Production and Consumption
3.01     In India, there are 27 sedimentary basins (Annex 3.1) with   total
area of approximately 1.7 million k2, of which about 1.4 million km (81%)
are onshore and the remainder offshore (to a water depth of 200 meters).
Commercial petroleum production has been established in only three sedimentary
basins, viz., the Upper Assam Shelf in north-eastern India, the Cambay basin
in Gujarat, and the Bombay offshore basin which has several petroleum fields,
namely, Bombay High, North Bassein (Panna), South Bassein, Heera and Ratnagiri
(Ratna).  Many of India's potential petroleum-bearing areas are still less
tham fully explored.  Historically, the pace and scope of exploration activity
has been unever. and resources have been concentrated on a few promising



-5-
areas. Since the discovery of the giant Bombay High field off the West Coast
of India in the mid-1970s, India has not made a new major discovery. The
ongoing exploration efforts of ONGC, however, have been encouraging and have
identified several petroleum-bearing areas which need further exploratory
drilling to determine their commercial potential. Indications of petroleum
have been found in eight other basins: Krishna-Godavari, Cauvery, Rajasthan,
Bengal, Andaman Islands, Himalayan Foothills-Ganga Valley, Tripura Fold Belt
and the Assam-Arakan Fold Belt. Furthermore, four other basins are considered
prospective on general geological grounds, although hydrocarbons have not yet
been discovered. These basins are Saurashtra, Kutch, Konkan-Kerala and
Mahanadi. The Krishna-Godavari and Cauvery basins offer the most promising
undeveloped potential to date. Estimates of India's potential total
recoverable hydrocarbon reserves are 4.5 billion tons of oil equivalent (toe),
of which about two-thirds are located offshore and 75% are expected to be in
the form of natural gas. Proven and probable recoverable hydrocarbon reserves
are currently estimated at 800 million toe of which 470 million tons is oil
and the remainder is natural gas (410 billion cubic meters or 330 million
toe). Natural gas is becoming increasingly important to the Indian economy
following the development of the Bombay High oil field with its associated gas
and as a result of the ongoing development of the large offshore South Bassein
gas field. Gas consumption is estimated to have reached the equivalent of 1.5
million toe in 1982/83, as compared with 1.1 million toe in 1980/81, and is
expected to increase sharply to about 6.8 millon toe by 1989/90.
3.02     As a result of the rapid development of the Bombay High field, crude
oil production from domestic reserves has increased steadily over the past 20
years, from about 0.5 million tons in 1960/61 to almost 7 million tons in
1970/71 and an estimated 21 million tons in 1982/83. For 1983/84, domestic
production is estimated to about 26 million tons mainly as a result of further
development of the Bombay High field. Consumption of crude oil grew at about
6.5% per annum over the past five years, and reached an estimated 40 million
tons in 1983/84. In that year imported crude oil accounted for 14 million
tons or about 35% of consumption. The estimated import bill for crude oil and
petroleum products was about US$4.S billion for 1983/84 representing 32% of
total merchandise imports and 58% of India's merchandise export earnings. By
the end of the Sixth Plan period (1984/85), consumption is expected to reach
about 44 million tons per year. This would exceed expected domestic
production from known petroleum reserves by about 14 million tons per year.
Table 3.1 summarizes the consumption and production trends for hydrocarbons.
3.03     While there are good prospects for increasing production from
existing fields, offshore as well as onshore, India's dependence on imported
oil could increase from a low of 33% in 1984/85 to about 50% in the early
1990s unless new major discoveries are made and developed in the next few
years (Annex 3.2). Thus, a concerted effort to accelerate exploration of
prospective areas and improve the efficiency of production of existing
petroleum resources is of vital importance and is a central objective of
Government petroleum policy. In recognition of this need, India is making
efforts to attract risk capital by inviting foreign oil companies to assist in
exploring for oil, both onshore and offshore; areas in about half of the
country's sedimentary basin areas have been offered to private oil companies

to participate in exploration under production-sharing contracts (para
3.09). In addition, the investment programs of ONGC and Oil India Timited
(OIL), the Government-owned institutions engaged in exploration and
development of hydrocarbon resources, have been increased by over 100% in real
tenrs in the current Sixth Five Year Plan (1980/81-1984/85) compared to the
previous plan period (para 3.10).
B. Petroleum Pricing
(a) Consumer Prices of Refined Petroleum Products
3.04     Domestic petroleum product and crude oil prices are regulated by the
Government, and the Government policy in petroleum pricing has been to
consistently set the price of petroleum products at levels designed to ensure
efficient use of energy. Retail product prices have been maintained, on
average, at or above international levels. At the present time, both the
level and structure of petroleum prices in India are considered
satisfactory. Current retail prices are summarized in Table 3.2.

(b) Producer Prices
3.05     Crude oil selling prices of ONGC and OIL, which were raised in July
1981 from US$6.1 per barrel to US$17.3 per barrel, are lower than
international prices but still ensure satisfactory profits for the
companies.  In 1982/83, ONGC's profit per barrel of oil (US$4/Bbl)l was in
line with the average for international oil companies. The profit is expected
to increase to $5 per barrel by 1984/85 at the current level of domestic
prices, provided anticipated increases in oil and gas production are
realized. The profits provide sufficient cash flow to enable the companies to
finance a substantial portion of their investment programs from internally-
generated funds (para 6.09). ONGC's and OIL's exploration and development
decisions are based on international prices, and hence the lower domestic
selling price does not act as a disincentive to exploration and development.
Under the production-sharing contracts, foreign oil companies will receive the
full international price for their sba:e of production that the Government has
the option to purchase.
(c)   Natural Gas Prices
3.06     Natural gas is currently sold directly by the producers (ONGC and
OIL) to consumers on the basis of long-term contracts that require Government
1/ ONGC's gas production was converted to oil equivalent and included in
total oil sold in arriving at this profit per barrel of oil.



approval. Natural gas prices vary according to use and source. On a use
basis, gas is priced to be competitive with the energy equivalent price of the
alternative fuel for which it is substituting. Offshore gas, which accounts
for about 55% of gas sales at present, is priced at between Rs 555 and Rs
2,780/1000 Nm3 depending on the intended use (US$1.49 and US$7.44 per thousand
SCF.). The lower price applies to interruptible supplies to power plants
otherwise using coal or high sulphur heavy fuel oil and the higher prices
apply to guaranteed supplies to indusZry and fertilizer lylants.  On average,
ONGC receives about Rs 1428/1000 Nm (US$3.83/1000 SCF)I! for offshore gas,
which is well above its production and delivery costs and, in energy terms, is
in line with the international price of fuel oil. Onshore gas prices are
relatively low, but will eventually be priced much higher; ONGC's intention is
to price t-he gas originating in Gujarat closer to the price of offshore gas.
For onshore gas from Gujarat, which accounts for about 20% of gas sales at
present, the current price is about Rs 355/1000 Nm (US$0.95/1000 SCF). This
price is heavily influenced by the low price stipulated in old long-term
contracts. ONGC intends to increase this price as contracts are being
reviewed or renegotiated, with the ultimate objective of applying the same
pricing principle (i.e., competitiveness with alternative fuels) as the one
used for offshore gas. Recently ONGC unilaterally increased Gujarat gas
prices to the level of offshore gas prices under some contracts that just
expired but industrial consumers have successfully challenged ONGC's action in
state courts. The matter is now under appeal by ONGC. It is likely that a
compromise will be reached which would raise the gas price close to (e.g.,
about 75%) fuel oil parity (excluding domestic taxes, i.e., CIF basis) over
several years (e.g., five years). For onshore gas from Assam, which aci unts
for about 25% of gas sales at present, the price is about Rs161/1000 NP
(US$0.43/lOOO SCF) reflecting the surplus of associated gas which is being
flared due to the small size of the market in that isolated region. The
average level of gas prices and their expected trend in the near future is
currently satisfactory.
C. Subsector Institutions
3.07     Ia the public sector, two companies, ONGC and OIL, have traditionally
undertaken petroleum exploration and production activities. ONGC had, and
will continue to have, the largest involvement in the petroleum sector as the
principal entity in charge of petroleum exploration and development. OIL is
much smaller than ONGC and produces about 3 million tpy of oil, all f;om
Assam. Until receatly, it had a license covering only about 2,500 km' in
Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The company has explored its license area
extensively and has replenished its reserves through steady but small
discoveries. Since late 1981, OIL obtained exploration rights in Orissa (the
Mahanadi basin), both onshore and offshore, and in areas in Rajasthan.
3.08     The Ministry of Energy is directly in charge of policy making in the
petroleum sector. It monitors activities in the sector closely and, inter
alia, has to vet all the programs and budgets proposed by public sector
enterprises. The Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB), a public body created
in 1974, provides financing to public sector enterprises in the petroleum
production and refinling sectors. Its only source of revenues is a cess levied
on domestic oil production. The Department of Economic Affairs of the
Ministry of Finance is responsible for approving foreign exchange expenditures
and for mobilizing foreign exchange resources. Finally, both the Ministry of

Finance and the Planning Commission review and approve the budget proposals of
ONGC and OIL as endorsed by the Ministry of Energy. The attached map (IBRD
Map No. 17603) presents the main features of India's petroleum subsector.
D. Petroleum Exploration Policies and Investment Strategy
3.09     The government's current investment program in the petroleum sector
contains the following three principal components: (i) to accelerate
exploration by both foreign and national oil companies; (ii) to increase
production from existing fields, primarily by accelerating the development
programs of ONGC and OIL in areas where hydrocarbons have already been
discovered; and (iii) to develop the gas pipeline system and gas-using
industries (e.g. fertilizer and petrochemical plants) to use more effectively
the significant gas reserves currently untapped. In order to encourage
foreign oil companies and attract risk capital for exploration, in late 1980,
the government offered to international bidders thirty-two blocks, each
ranging in size from 10,000 to 30,020 km offshore and onshore. The total
area offered, almost 0.9 million km , represented about 50% of the country's
sedimentary basin area. One production-sharing agreement was signed with a
consortium led by Chevron (USA) for an 18,500 km block in the Saurasthra
basin offshore Gujarat, north of the Bombay High field.  The terms of the
production sharing agreement provide for Chevron to drill at least three
wells, spending a minimum of US$29 million over a three-year period, at its
own risk. Upon commercial discovery, ONGC may assume up to 50Z joint venture
in future development (without payment of exploration costs), and production
will be split according to a scale which escalates with field profitability.
Until India achieves self-sufficiency in oil, GOI has the option to purchase
Chevron's share of the oil produced at international prices. Chevron has
completed the seismic surveys and drilling started in late 1983 after the
monsoon season. Meanwhile, invitations to bid on a second round of offerings
were issued end-August 1982 to 37 foreign oil companies. The second offering
covered about 50 blocks both onshore and offshore, including new areas such as
west of the Bombay High field (in 200 m of water) and the outer-shelves of the
offshore Krishna-Godavari and Mahanadi basins.  Unfortunately this second
offering coincided with the worldwide decline in investments for petroleum
exploration by the international oil companies which affected most of the
developing countries, particularly the oil importing ones. Only a few bids
were received in early 1983; discussions are still going on with two of these
bidders. It appears that any substantial increase in participation by
international oil companies is unlikely to materialize for a few more years.
Nonetheless, the first steps in opening up prospective acreage to private oil
companies have been initiated; any significant increase in the participation
of private oil companies to a level commensurate with India's exploration
needs will require not only a turnaround in worldwide exploration activities
but also flexible and imaginative approaches in attracting new exploration
investment. The ongoing discussions with foreign oil companies will provide a
preliminary test. The Indian authorities reiterated during project appraisal
the Government's intention to continue its "open-door" policy and to undertake
new initiatives after a turnaround in worldwide exploration activities take
place. One idea being considered is to have ONGC's subsidiary, Hydrocarbons
India Limited (para 4.03), form joint-ventures with both foreign and local
private companies to undertake exploration projects. In the meantime however,
any accelerated development of India's hydrocarbon potential will depend
largely on ONGC's and OIL's ability to undertake and manage large and complex
investment programs.



- 10 -
3.10     Following the successful implementation of the initial four phases of
development of the Bombay High field as well as the encouraging results of
recent exploration activities, GOI has authorized both ONGC and OIL to
accelerate their petroleum exploration and development programs. Thus, while
the current Plan (1980/81-1984/85) originally earmarked about Rs 33.3 billion
in 1980/81 prices for petroleum exploration and development, which represented
a 47% real increase above the actual expenditures during the previous five-
year period (1975/76-1979/80), ONGC and OIL have responded with a much higher
revised budget proposal of about Rs 57.8 billion in 1980/81 prices for
exploration and development, most of which has already been approved. The
focus of this revised program (para. 4.11) is the accelerated implementation
of the fifth and sixth development phases of the Bombay High field, the
development of the offshore South Bassein gas field including the related gas
transportation infrastructure, further exploratory drilling in the Krishna-
Godavari basin, and further exploration and development in the onshore
producing areas (i.e. Cambay Basin and Assam).
E.  The Bank's Role and Lending Strategy in the Petroleum Subsector
3.11     Most of the Bank's lending operations to India in energy have been in
the power subsector (31 Bank/IDA operations for a total of US$3,656 million)
and span a period of 34 years. However, the Bank's involvement in the
petroleum subsector has grown substantially within the last six years. Four
loans have been made to ONGC including two for the development of the Bombay
High field-V (US$550 million in all); one2for exploration in the
KCrishna-Godavari basin (US$165.5 million)- , ani another for offshore gas
development in South-Bassein (US$222.3 million)-. A loan (UStOO million)
has also been made for the modernization of several refineries_ I.
3.12     Although ONGC was the main beneficiary of these four loans, each
project was designed to address a specific set of issues in the sector. The
first Bombay High project aimed at establishing the basis for a sound long-
term development program for Bombay High (the most important oil field in
India), initiating the early development phases in an effective manner, and
introducing ONGC to the financial markets. These objectives were largely
fulfilled. The second was aimed at accelerating the development of Bombay
High at the time of rapid increase in oil prices. The South Bassein operation
sets the initial conditions for the creation and development of gas
infrastructure, while the Krishna-Godavari exploration project provides a
framework within which ONGC exploration policies as well as the balance
between national and private resources can be better assessed. The proposed
project aims at improving the efficiency of onshore operations, which though
smaller than Bombay High (in terms of oil production) can make a substantial
contribution to domestic petroleum supplies. The Bombay High I project w s
satisfactorily completed and a completion report has already been issued 7;
disbursement for the Bombay High II project has just been completed.

3.13     With regard to oil exploration, India's recent policy of having
parallel efforts by national and international oil companies is fully
justified and is well focused. While not formally associated with the
process, the Bank has been instrumental in increasing the attractiveness of
the offerings (the seven proposals received in the 1980 offering were for two
blocks added at the suggestion of the Bank). The Bank will continue its
dialogue with the Government on this subject to improve the chances of success
of future exploration acreage offerings to the private sector. Through its
own lending the Bank has, to a considerable extent, also assisted in
minimizing the risks of the Krishna-Godavari exploration program by reducing
the project area and bringing about a more balanced exploration among the
onshore, shallow offshore and deep offshore portions of the project area. The
Krishna-Godavari exploration project is the first major basin exploration
project undertaken by ONGC. While ONGC has the basic capability to manage
this program, Bank involvement in the design of the program, methods of
implementation, evaluation of results, and adjustments made to the program,
has also benefitted ONGC staff and made them better appreciate the risks
involved.
3.14     India's western offshore free and associated gas reserves are quite
large, with a production potential equivalent in energy terms to 65Z to 80Z of
the maximum western offshore oil production expected. But these gas reserves
are currently underdeveloped, primarily because of difficulties in matching
resources with markets. The development of the South Bassein offshore gas
field represents a new challenge to ONGC and the government as it is the first
major gas development project in India. Unlike crude oil, such a project has
to be optimized not only in terms of reservoir considerations, but also in
relation to the potential market for natural gas. During the preparation of
that project the Bank discussed with GOI, ONGC, and its consultants, the scope
of market studies to be carried out and has been instrumental in demonstrating
the benefits of a wider utilization of gas. As a result, the main components
of that project have been optimized in terms of the anticipated market. This
dialogue will continue during project supervision as GOI formulates a long-
term gas strategy designed to accelerate the development of free and
associated gas reserves, based not only on the use of gas as feedstock in the
fertilizer industry but also as boiler and household fuel.
3.15     So far, Bank assistance to the petroleum sector has aimed at acceler-
ating the offshore programs which held the promise of quicker and larger
oil/gas production increases. The offshore programs are progressing
satisfactorily and now is the time to address the relatively more complex
issues of onshore operations. In this regard, the future role of the Bank in
India should be to: (i) assist the Goverrment and the national oil companies
to establish investment priorities, particularly by bringing the international
experience of Bank specialists and consultants to bear on these problems; and
(ii) support well-defined projects which will also act as vehicles for
managerial and operational improvements, transfer of technology, and further
mobilization of financing from commercial sources.   In this context, an
effective dialogue has been established with ONGC regarding its overall
investment plans and strategy. This dialogue can be expected to be maintained
through the Bank's continuing presence in key investment areas. These efforts
should proceed in parallel through various projects, each addressing one or
two specific sets of issues.



- 12 -
3.16     In the case of the proposed Cambay Basin Petroleum Project, the Bank
has made a substantial contribution in: (i) modifying and improving the scope
of, and the implementation arrangements for, the investment program in the
basin; (ii) providing the basis for improving ONGC's oil field operations
through training, use of consultants and introduction of appropriate and
modern technology, equipment and materials; (iii) suggesting improvements
in ONGC's drilling and other operational policies and practices; and
(iv) encouraging the Government and ONGC to continue to diversify their
sources of foreign exchange financing.
3.17     The Bank has consistently encouraged ONGC to diversify its sources of
foreign exchange financing. This effort has been largely successful and ONGC
has established itself as a credit worthy borrower in the international
financial market. Initially, cofinancing was mostly associated with specific
procurement packages using export, buyer's or supplier's credits, although
recently ONGC has borrowed increasing amounts of untied funds through Euro-
currency borrowings from commercial banks. Of the eleven commercial bank
borrowings by ONGC during 1977-83, eight (ranging from US$16 to US$42 million
each for a total of about US$232 million) were buyer's credits, that is, were
specifically associated with the purchase of major equipment packages (e.g.,
platforms, jack-up rigs, etc.) and entered into after the pro:urement award
was made. The other three were major Euro-currency borrowings for general
corporate purposes (i.e., not earmarked for specific procurement items) and
each one was entered into following negotiations/approval of a Bank-financed
project. A substantial proportion of these funds were eventually utilized for
Bank-assisted projects. The first (US$50 million) followed Bank approval of
the Bombay High I Project; the second (US$200 million) followed approval of
the Bombay High II Project; and the third (US$400 million) followed approval
of the South Bassein Gas Development Project.
IV. THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMNISSION (ONGC)
A. Introduction
4.01     The beneficiary of the proposed loan will be the Oil and Natural Gas
Commission (ONGC). ONGC was initially formed in 1955 as the Oil and Natural
Gas Directorate within the then Ministry of Natural Resources and Scientific.
Research. In 1959, the Directorate was transformed into a separate statutory
body and re-named the Oil and Natural Gas Commission by an act of
Parliament. ONGC was to "plan, promote and implement the development of
petroleum resources and the production and sale of petroleum products produced
by it." ONGC's statutes provide that it is a corporate body with power to
acquire, hold and dispose of property. ONGC also has authority to contract
and borrow. ONGC has evolved into a full-fledged oil company although its
operations are primarily petroleum exploration and production, including the
sale of natural gas, and do not include oil refining nor sales of refined
petroleum products.
4.02     ONGC is managed by an operating board or commission consisting of a
Chairman and not less than two, but not more than eight, Members appointed by
the government generally for a period of five years each. At present, the
commission consists of the Chairman, six full-time Members (Finance,
Materials, Personnel, Exploration, Offshore and Onshore) and two part-time
Members (representing the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Energy). All



- 13 -
decisions of the commission must be approved by a majority of the Members.
The commission sets policics, manages the activities of ONGC, and develops the
plans and budgets of ONGC which have to be endorsed by the Ministry of Energy,
Ministry of Finance and the Planning Commission before they are sanctioned by
Parliament.
4.03     ONGC has established three institutes to support its petroleum
operations and one subsidiary to undertake foreign ventures. The first
institute established in 1963, was the Institute of Petroleum Exploration
(KDMIPE) .i   This institute presently has a staff of about 800 technical
personnel and reviews all exploration proposals, programs and exploratory well
locations. The second institute, established in 1977, was the Institute of
Reservoir Studies (IRS) which provides technical support in the areas of
reservoir engineering, field development planning as well as enhanced oil
recovery research and applications. IRS has about 80 technical staff at
present. The third institute, established in 1978, was the Institute of
Drilling Technology (IDT). This institute has a staff of about 50 technical
personnel and is responsible for setting the drilling policies and standards
of ONGC, for reviewing and approving well designs and drilling programs, and
for training. Finally, ONGC has a subsidiary, Hydrocarbons India Limited
(RIL), established in 1964, which undertakes foreign ventures. HIL took a
one-sixth share in a production-sharing exploration venture in Iran (1968-
1980) and undertook an exploration contract in Iraq (1973-1977). HIL also
undertook contract drilling work in Tanzania (1976-1979) and in Iraq (1977-
1979). All these ventures are now completed or terminated. While HIL has no
foreign venture prospects at this time, it is expected that it will
participate in local joint ventures with both foreign and domestic private
companies to provide technical support services which ONGC will increasingly
need as well as to undertake exploration projects.
4.04     ONGC's organization and operations have expanded rapidly, both in
terms of size and complexity, during the last eleven years as shown by the
figures in Table 4.1. Most of the growth and diversification was the result
of the hydrocarbon discovery in 1974, and subsequent development, of the giant
Bombay High offshore oil field.
B. Organization and Management
1.       Organization and Management Structure
4.05     ONGC's organization chart is shown in Annex 4.1.  At present, ONGC's
main exploration, development and production activities are divided among two
major groups under the Member Onshore and the Member Offshore respectively.
Onshore operations are further sub-divided into three regions, the Eastern
Region with headquarters in Nazira (Assam) and covering Assam and the adjacent
states; the Western Region with headquarters in Vadodara and covering Gujarat,
Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and the northern states; and the Central Region with
headquarters in Calcutta covering West Bengal, Bihar, Madya Pradesh,
Maharashtra and the southern states. The proposed Cambay Basin project will
1/ Renamed the Keshava Deva Malaviya Institute of Petroleum Exploration
(KDMIPE) in 1982.



- 14 -
be under the jurisdiction of the Western Region; the organization chart for
this group is shown in Annex 4.2. Offshore operations are grouped into the
Bombay Offshore Project (BOP) with headquarters in Bombay. The main
administrative and financial functions (planning, procurement and stores,
accounting, personnel, computer activities, etc.) and technical support
services are centralized in the corporate headquarters at Dehra Dun located
about 200 km. north of New Delhi.
4.06     Following the rapid expansicn of ONGC during the last eleven years,
the offshore/onshore organizational framework has become complex, and
currently the overall ONGC structure is beginning to show strains and
inefficiencies. With ONGC's growth expected to continue into the 1990's, the
issue of organizational efficiency has become a serious concern to ONGC, the
government as well as the Bank. A specific proposal to restructure ONGC has
been submitted to the Ministry of Energy along the following three concepts:
(a) the "common basin" management approach in which specific operations in an
entire basin, even those with both onshore and offshore portions or those
straddling state boundaries, would be managed by the same unit; (b) the
business group or functional approach in which activities would be grouped
into similar functions or profit/cost centers rather than by geographical
location; and (c) the concentration of ONGC resources and efforts in the basic
exploration and production activities with a reduction in ONGC's own
participat4nns 4n  rrs Pilch as netroleum transportation, drilling equipment
and other technical support services which can be provided by contractors.
The "common basin" approach has already been introduced and the more
substantial organizational restructuring is expected to be implemented within
the next year or two. The Bank supports this streamlining of ONGC's
organization and will continue to exchange ideas with ONGC on specific
operational aspects of its organizational framework.
2.       Management Information Systems
4.07     Under the Bank's first project with ONGC (Bombay High I project, para
3.12), the accounting and financial systems of ONGC, as well as the project
management and reporting system of BOP, were reviewed by consultants whose
main recommendations have since been implemented by ONGC. During the past
several years, ONGC has developed adequate management information systems. A
comprehensive operational monthly report is prepared by BOP and each of the
regional onshore groups, which highlights to ONGC management the status of
different activities and enables the commission to take remedial actions
whenever the need arises. Some of the major accounting systems (e.g. payroll,
budget) have also been recently computerized. This will enable ONGC to close
its financial books and prepare its unaudited financial reports as well as
prepare its budget much faster than before. Other financial systems (e.g.
cash and bank deposit management) are in the process of being computerized.
ONGC has submitted timely progress and financial reports to the Bank and no
problems are expected in the future. During negotiations, agreement was
reached with O{GC that it will provide the Bank with periodic project progress
reports (?ara 5.56) as well as semi-annual unaudited financial reports during
project implementation within 45 days after the end of the period covered.
ONGC will also be asked to prepare a Project Completion Report within six
months after the project is completed or after the proposed loan is completely
disbursed.

3.       Accounts and Audit
4.08     Each project unit has a Finance and Accounts Section reporting to the
Project Manager and to the Member Finance at ONGC's headquarters. The
Internal Audit Section is also under the Member Finance, in Dehra Dun, and
performs satisfactorily. ONGC's acounts are audited by the government's
Comptroller and Auditor General, which is acceptable to the Bank. Starting
with the 1981/82 audited financial statements, ONGC included supplemental
information covering inflation adjusted accounts as well as reserve
(petroleum) recognition accounting. This is indicative of the increasingly
sophisticated financial reporting system developed recently and further
enhances ONGC's standing in the international financial market. While ONGC's
accounts are generally available four months after the end of the fiscal year
at the latest, GOI rules and regulations provide that ONGC's audited accounts
cannot be made public before they have been approved by Parliament. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that the Commission's audited accounts
will be submitted to the Bank not later than twelve months after the end of
the fiscal year.
4.       Insurance
4.09     ONGC has adequate insurance coverage for its existing offshore
installation, equipment, vessels, etc., with several insurance companies in
India which are reinsured in the international market. Insuring follows the
international practice whereby designs are certified by independent
agencies. ONGC self-insures onshore petroleum exploration and production
facilities, which are relativelv less expensive compared to offshore
facilities. This is reasonable given the geographic diversity of its onshore
activities. ONGC's insurance coverage for its existing facilities is
satisfactory.
C. ONGC's Investment Program (1984/85-1989/90)
4.10     ONGC is now on the fourth year of the Five-Year Plan (1980/81-
1984/85). This Plan was revised in August 1981 to include the accelerated
programs for exploration and for the final development of the Bombay High
field. ONGC has also prepared plans covering the second half of the decade
and the next twenty years respectively. These plans are in two variants:
Variant I has the objective of increasing ONGC's annual oil production to
about 45 million tons by 1989/90 while Variant II aims at 60 million tons per
year of oil production by 1989/90. Both of these variants are ambitious,
given that ONGC's existing reserves, when fully developed, can reach an annual
production rate of just about 31 million tons of oil (ONGC's oil production in
1982/83 was about 18 million tons). These plans therefore assume that
increased exploration in the early 1980's will yield commercial discoveries
which can be brought into production by the end of the decade. The government
in principle approved in November 1982, all exploration components as well as
the development of presently known reserves proposed in Variant I, but did not
approve the speculative portion relating to the development of expected future
discoveries. These types of development investment will be proposed by ONGC
as the discoveries are actually made. The portion of Variant I approved by
the government is known as the Core Plan and its major components are briefly
discussed in Annex 4.3. The Core Plan investments over the next six years are
summarized in Table 4.2.

a/ Items common to exploration and development, which account for
about 35% of the total investments have been allocated 75% tc
development and 25% to exploration. The proposed Cambay Basin
Petroleum project would account for about 5Z of the Core Plan
investments during this period.
4.11     In the absence of new major discoveries, ONGC's reserves/production
ratio will decline from about 23 years at present to only about 12 years by
1989/90. This means that the rate of increase in oil production will begin to
slow down after 1984/85, production will peak towards the end of the decade,
and then gradually decline thereafter unless new commercial discoveries are
made and brought into production within the next five to ten years. Without
new discoveries and increased recovery from existing reserves, ONGC would find
it difficult to continue to generate the internal resources needed to finance
a major proportion of its investment program. Thus, for ONGC to maintain
prudent debt/equity and debt service coverage ratios, the government will have
to either provide additional equity funds or increase ONGC's selling prices
substantially or the program would have to be reduced to match the
availability of funds. This emphasizes the importance of seeking major new
discoveries in the next few years and justifies the ambitious exploration
program which represents about 37% of total investment until the end of the
decade. It also emphasizes the need for ONGC to maintain prudent financial
policies, particularly with respect to borrowings, until its petroleum reserve
base is further increased. ONGC's exploration strategy is to balance the
program between areas of lower risk and lower potential with areas of higher
risk but with greater potential for discovering large new reserves. During
the next six years, about half of the exploration investment will be in
producing areas of Assam, Gujarat and offshore Bombay, which in the near term
hold promise of modest but more certain additions to reserves. In addition,
ONaC will continue the ongoing evaluation of the Krishna-Godavari delta which
is the most promising frontier area in India today and which in the medium
term could contribute major additions to petroleum reserves.

D. Operating Performance and Challenges
4.12     ONGC is a competent organization which has been able to take
increasingly larger responsibilities over a short period of time. Its growth
and overall performance during the past decade is impressive as its activities
have progressed from relatively small onshore operations and almost complete
reliance on in-house capabilities, to large integrated offshore projects
requiring sophisticated management, the acquisition of modern technology, and
the use of international contractors. But, as indicated earlier, the very
fast growth and diversification of activities has caused serious organiza-
tional and managerial strains. These have been recognized and are expected to
be largely remedied through the proposed restructuring of the organization
which would decentralize the operating management while retaining a
centralized policy-making system, as well as establish profit or cost centers
for control and evaluation purposes. Rapid growth has also introduced serious
operational and financial constraints which could adversely affect the
implementation of ONGC's accelerated petroleum exploration and development
program. The demands of the large offshore operations, which continue to
absorb most of ONGC's resources, have led to a relative neglect of onshore
operations, stretched ONGC's project implementation capacity, created a
shortage of experienced technical staff and brought about a need to mobilize
large amounts of foreign exchange resources very quickly. As a consequence,
ONGC's onshore operations have suffered from insufficient exploration and
development budgets, less experienced technical staff, and grossly inadequate
equipment as well as obsolete technology (Annex 4.4). These factors are
reflected in the lack of any substantial growth in ONGC's onshore oil reserves
and production over the last decade _/  The Core Plan investments for the next
six years have begun to remedy this imbalance. While still heavily offshore
oriented, the Plan reflects a relatively higher proportion of onshore
investments particularly for exploration, compared to the last five years.
4.13     In order for ONGC to effectively and efficiently undertake the large
investment program and operations envisaged for the rest of the decade, it has
to take decisive actions along several fronts. In addition to the
organizational re-structuring and larger budget allocations for the onshore
operations mentioned earlier, the following are required: (i) to adopt a
policy of contracting a substantial proportion of the drilling and technical
services in onshore operations (as in the case of offshore operations), not
only to complement ONGC's own limited capabilities and act as vehicles for
technology transfer. but also to focus more of ONGC's scarce technical
manpower and financial resources on the basic exploration and development
activities (para 5.34); (ii) to expand and upgrade the training program for
oil field workers which is minimal and unsatisfactory at present; (iii) to use
technical consultants to help improve onshore operations as is the case in
offshore operations; (iv) to replace and upgrade the existing equipment and
technology for exploration, drilling, workover and production in onshore
operations; (v) to improve field communications in all onshore regional
1/ Another reason for the lack of growth in onshore production is the
political and social unrest in Assam during the last several years which has
slowed ONGC exploration and development efforts in the Eastern Region.

operations; and (vi) to continue to diversify the sources of foreign exchange
financing, particularly the use of commercial bank loans, while keeping the
overall debt/equity ratio and the debt service coverage ratio at prudent
levels (para 6.05).
4.14     ONGC has already taken steps along the lines mentioned above and the
proposed project will reinforce and emphasize these actions. For example ONGC
has adopted an approach of using offshore and onshore drilling contractors for
as much as 40%, as well as hiring offshore supply vessels for as much as 65%,
of the company's requirements. Similarly, ONGC is already contracting out a
major proportion of its offshore technical well services and is also beginning
to contract for onshore technical services. In all of these areas, ONGC has
encouraged local firms to form joint ventures with experienced foreign firms
in order to lower costs and contribute to the technology transfer into the
country. The proposed project is also intended to improve ONGC's onshore
operations.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Background
5.01     The systematic search for hydrocarbons in the Cambay Basin (IBRD Map
No. 17604) was begun by ONGC in the mid-1950's supported by technical
assistance supplied by the U.S.S.R.. The first hydrocarbon discovery was made
in 1958; however, ONGC did not become aware of the basin's true potential
until the discovery of the Ankleshvar field in 1960 (the largest and most
productive field in the Cambay Basin). The bulk of the oil reserves
established in the basin was discovered between 1960 to 1970, with only minor
fields and moderate quantities of oil reserves discovered since then. A total
of 1324 wells have been drilled in the basin through 1982, of which 697 are
exploratory tests and 627 field development wells. To date, about 170 oil or
gas prospects (structures, fault closures, or stratigraphic traps) have been
identified, of which 134 have been drilled and 49 established as hydrocarbon
bearing (a 36% success ratio).
5.02     As mentioned earlier, ONGC and Bank petroleum staff discussed in 1982
ONGC's petroleum investment program and, in particular, its plans for
increasing oil and gas production onshore and offshore. In general, ONGC is
expecting offshore areas (i.e. the offshore Bombay Basin) to provide the major
portion of the anticipated increase in oil and gas production during the
1980's. Accordingly, the offshore effort was given the preference over
onshore operations in the use of the most modern drilling equipment, support
facilities and qualified field and technical personnel. As regards onshore
areas, ONGC was satisfied with a strategy of first stabilizing and then
moderately increasing onshore oil production by approximately 25% over the
next seven to ten years. The consequences of ONGC's past investment strategy
in the onshore part of the Cambay Basin have been the following:
(a) Hydrocarbon production in the basin is oriented toward the recovery
of lighter crudes, leaving the vast in-place reserves of heavier
oill  located in the northern parts of the basin undeveloped;
1/ Crude oil of about 18 degrees API gravity and a viscosity range of 100 to
550 centipoise found in the Balol, Lanwa and northern Santhal oil fields.



- 20 -
(b) Approximately 345 potentially producing wells are at present inactive
and in need of mechanical repair. However, the current fleet of ONGC
workover rigs in the basin is old, inefficient and unable to keep up
with the repair load. Lost oil production due to the backlog of
wells to be repaired is estimated at about 300,000 to 400,000 tons
per year;
(c) A total of about 550 development infill wells are required during the
next 3 to 4 years to sustain current levels of production and
adequately drain some reservoirs. However, available drilling rigs
are outdated and unable to perform this field development task due to
excessive breakdowns and maintenance difficulties;
td) The basin's greatest remaining exploratory potential is beneath the
shallow waters of the Gulf of Cambay and the contiguous tidal swept
mud flats and shoal areas. However, due to technical and equipment
constraints, very little exploration effort was planned in this
shallow water/tidal area.
5.03     Following technical discussions  with Bank staff and conbultants
during the project identification, preparation and appraisal process, ONGC has
been able to formulate a comprehensive exploration, development and field
rehabilitation program which the government has accepted as a high priority
undertaking. The most important aspects of this program are incorporated in
the proposed project. While this project is partly based on ongoing ONGC
investments, a significant portion of the restructured investment program in
Cambay is based on new initiatives, identified with the assistance of the
Bank. The development of the heavy oil fields, which were discovered in the
late 1960's, is a case in point. This development had not been planned by
ONGC for this decade due to a misconception (as a result of inferior well
design and lack of good reservoir engineering in the early 1970's) that these
fields can only be produced by advanced enhanced oil recovery {EOR), i.e.,
thermal recovery techniques. Thus, ONGC had only planned for some pilot
thermal recovery schemes to form the basis for a full scale commercial EOR
project during the 1990's. It was for assistance in these pilot EOR schemes
that ONGC initially approached the Bank. Subsequently, however, the Bank
staff was able to convince ONGC and the government that these heavy oil fields
can and should be immediately produced by primary methods using proper well
design and artificial lift equipment. The final development plan for the
Kalol field, on the other hand, was conceived and proposed by ONGC's staff
(with Soviet assistance) but, because the plan relied on extensive utilization
of artificial lift equipment in addition to water flooding, which made it
complicated and relatively expensive, it did not receive, prior to the
involvement of the Bank, the proper priority in ONGC's investment plans due
primarily to the resource constraints faced by ONGC and the tendency of
favoring offshore investments to onshore investments.
5.04     Although ONGC has extensively and successfully utilized foreign
contractor services and consultants for offshore operations, ONGC prefers to
undertake, and during the past decade has in fact undertaken, all onshore
operations by itself. There has also been very little transfer of experience
and technology from the offshore to the onshore operations. Both of these
factors have seriously retarded the technological development of onshore



- 21 -
activities. However, a major breakthrough was achieved under the Krishna-
Godavari exploration project when ONGC utilized, for the first time in over a
decade, foreign drilling contractors and consultants for the deep abnormal
high pressure onshore exploration drilling component of that project. ONGC is
now appreciating more fully the benefits of hiring foreign drilling
contractors for some of the more difficult exploration drilling onshore.
Under the proposed project, ONGC will also hire technical consultants as well
as foreign drilling and technical well services contractors.
B. Main Characteristics of the Hydrocarbon Fields in the Cambay Basin.
5.05     The Cambay Basin (IBRD Nap No. 17604) covers an area of about 56,000
square kilometers and is one of the major petroleum basins in India. Located
in the State of Gujarat in northwest India, the basin is a roughly north-
south, down-dropped graben (i.e., fault-bounded trench) approximately 400
kilometers in length and 80 kilometers in width. Due to the sand distribution
pattern of the main producing sequence, the oil/gas fields are noticeably
grouped to the northern and southern ends of the graben with few exploratory
locations and producing fields in the central area.
5.06     To date, ONGC has concentrated geophysical, exploratory drilling and
field development efforts in the northern tectonic blocks of the Cambay Basin
where the search for oil and gas has reached a relatively mature stage.
However, the southern and central portions of the basin, including the
nearshore tidal and shallow water areas of the Gulf of Cambay, remain
relatively untouched and still in an early stage of development.
5.07     Annex 5.1 describes the geology and main petroleum fields of the
Cambay Basin.  The main characteristics of the hydrocarbon fields in the basin
are summarized below:

C. Status of Development of the Cambay Basin
5.08     Proved initial petroleum in-place reserves in the Cambay Basin are
currently estimated to be about 500 million tons of oil equivalent (tog) of
which about 447 million tons is oil and 53 million toe (65.7 billion m ) is
gas. Many of the petroleum pools have small initial in-place reserves of just
1 to 3 million toe. Approximately 140 million toe, or 28% of the proven in-
place reserves, is recoverable. Cumulative production up to January 1983 was
about 74 million toe - 67 million tons of oil and 7 million toe of gas. The



- 22 -
remaining recoverable reserves are thus about 66 million toe of which about 49
million tons is oil and 17 million toe is gas.  Current production av erages
8,920 tons per day (3.2 million tons per year) of oil and 2 million m /day
(0.6 million toe per year) of gas. About one-half of the oil production comes
from the Ankleshvar field, the largest and most important petroleum field in
the basin. However, this major field has passed its peak productive years and
its production has declined from 2 to about 1.5 million tons per year of oil
at present. The petroleum reserves and production are distributed as follows:

b/  About 36.1 billion m3 (29 million toe) are either non-recoverable or are
gas caps and isolated pools that ONGC does not intend to produce in the
foreseeable future.
5.09     Of the Cambay Basin total proven initial oil0in-place (IOIP),
approximately 45 million tons are heavy oil (i.e., 18 API gravity or lower
and 50 to 550 centipoise viscosity at formation temperature). These heavy oil
reserves are essentially associated with one basic, elongated productive
feature in the northern end of the basin. These fields are: Santhal, Balol
and Lanwa. Estimated proven oil reserves in Santhal are about 40 million
tons. Current estimates of proven heavy oil reserves in Balol and Lanva are
only about 5 million tons (IOIP), but both proven and probable reserves are
estimated to be about 42 million tons. These estimates are subject to large
variations due to the widely scattered well control and inadequate subsurface
data until now. However, wells are to be drilled shortly as part of the
project to better delineate the heavy oil reserves which are expected to be
substantially in excess of current estimates.
5.10     About 25 isolated small oil and gas discoveries in the basin have not
been fully evaluated. Furthermore, two interesting recent discoveries are the
non-associated gas fields, Dahej and Hazira, which have yet to be fully
evaluated with respect to total gas reserves. In addition, there are a number
of wells with indicated recorded hydrocarbon accumulations that were not
adequately tested or for which completion attempts were inconclusive. ONGC
plans to develop most of the isolated oil fields during the next several years
and is currently appraising the Dahej gas field.

D. Project Concept and Objectives
5.11     The major concept supporting the Cambay Basin Petroleum Project is
that exploration and exploitation investments in a near mature hydrocarbon
producing basin, while not anticipated to provide spectacular results, are
often among the lower cost and lower risk opportunities available to establish
additional proven reserves and markedly increase production levels. However,
to achieve this would require a high level of organizational, operational and
technical efficiency in all facets of petroleum operations as well as a
systematic analysis of investment opportunities and priorities. Unfortu-
nately, ONGC is presently deficient in many of these aspects. At the same
time, priority investments cover the full range of petroleum activities, from
exploration to enhanced oil recovery. This is because a substantial portion
of the basin is still only lightly explored while the existing major producing
fields have passed their peak productive years; their declining production
must be made up by developing several undeveloped fields, improving production
efficiency and preparing for enhanced oil recovery applications. Thus, the
main project concept is to define an optimal program of investments as well as
a broad program for improving ONGC's operating efficiency, and then design a
project to effectively integrate and implement the investment and institu-
tional improvement programs simultaneously in order to realize the substantial
economic benefits as early as possible.
5.12     The proposed project thus has four major components with the follow-
ing specific objectives: (i) exploration - to pursue the search for petroleum
by drilling deeper to less explored prospects, and by acquiring seismic data
and hence identifing potential hydrocarbon prospects in the unexplored shallow
waters and shoal areas of the Gulf of Cambay; (ii) development and production
- to accelerate the development of undeveloped and underdeveloped oil fields
and improve maintenance of wells thereby increasing oil production in the
basin by slose to 2 million tons per year and gas production by about 142
million m per year (0.12 million toe per year) within six years;
(iii) enhanced oil recovery pilot tests -   to increase recoverable reserves
by about 20 million tons of heavy oil and 4 million tons of light oil by
determining the most appropriate enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method through
field pilot schemes; and (iv) technical training and assistance - to improve
the drilling and production efficiency in the basin through training programs,
hiring of technical consultants and contractors, as well as introducing new
and modern equipment as an integral part of project implementation. The
project has already been formally approved by the Public Investment Board
(PIB).
E. Project Components
5.13     The project components are discussed in Annex 5.2 and are briefly
described below.
1.       Exploration Component
5.14     The exploration component has two sub-components, a seismic survey
and deep exploration drilling.



- 24 -
a.    Seismic Survey
5.15     Approximately 20% of the Cambay Basin is in the Cambay Gulf and
covered by current swept shallow waters, tidal mud flats and shoals. To date,
this highly prospective area has not been surveyed by ONGC with modern seismic
methods due to the lack of specialized geophysical techniques and equipment
needed to acquire data in this difficult environment. Only one well has been
drilled in the mud flats area, the Aliabet No. 1, which tested oil in the
Miocene. The seismic survey included in the project will: (i) help outline
the seaward extent of the Dahej structure, a major Eocene gas field discovered
in 1979 and currently under appraisal; (ii) delineate possible fault
controlled structures (i.e., drillable prospects) in the Gulf similar to the
Ankleshvar field; and (iii) help determine the western limits of the
hydrocarbon bearing Eocene sands of the Narbada river delta. About 1,750 line
kilometers of data will be acquired for this purpose using modern seismic
survey techniques. Furthermore, depending upon the successful outcome of the
offshore North Tapi No. 1 wildcat, located in the Gulf of Cambay about 75
kilometers southwest of Ankleshvar field, ONGC may propose, in late 1984, to
add another 800 line kilometers of seismic survey under the project. This
seismic acquisition would be south of the area covered by the 1,750 kilometer
progrim and restricmed to the eastern shoreline and saltwater marsh/swamp
areas of the Gulf _'  The additional cost could be covered from the physical
contingencies provided in the cost estimate.
b.    Deep Exploratory Drilling
5.16     Most identifiable subsurface/seismic features in the basin have been
drilled at least through the main Middle Eocene pay zones (i.e., down to about
3,000 meters). Future production increases from the onshore basin, other than
that realized from infill drilling of undeveloped or underdeveloped fields and
proposed EOR schemes, must be derived from yet to-be-tested deep prospects
including those from reservoirs draped over basement highs located some 4,000
to 5,000 meters deep. The four deep exploration wells included in the
proposed project represent the next logical phase in the exploration and
exploitation of the basin. These four wells have been designed to primarily
test deep prospects in zones which have previously indicated the presence of a
hydrocarbon reservoir in other locations where these zones are relatively
shallower or have been drilled (unsuccessfully) recently. Successful
completion of these wells will provide ONGC with better information on
hydrocarbon trends and zones that could potentially yield commercial petroleum
reserves to supplant the depletion of existing fields. The four locations
proposed for drilling are: (i) Bharkodra, (ii) Jambusar-P, (iii) West Kalol
and (iv) South Warosan. These are described in Annex 5.3 and shown in IBRD
Map No. 17604.
1/ The 1,750 line-kilometers of survey will consist of about 1,450 line
kilometers of "teleseis" over the tidal and shoal area and 300 line-kilometers
of shallow water survey. The additional 800 line-kilometers would also
utilize the "teleseis" technology. "Teleseis" is a method of seismic data
acquisition that utilizes electronic transmitters rather than cables to
"connect" the grid of recording stations and can therefore cover larger areas
and difficult terrains better than conventional cable systems.



- 25 -
2.       Development and Production Component
5.17     The development and production component has four sub-components: (i)
the final development or completion of the final development schemes of
several light oil fields namely Kalol, North Kadi, South Kadi, Sobhasan and
Nawagam; (ii) the initial (primary) development of the heavy oil fields namely
North Santhal, Balol and Lanwa; (iii) the rehabilitation of the Cambay gas
field, the largest non-associated gas field in the basin; and (iv) improvement
of well maintenance (workover) operations to eliminate the substantial backlog
of production wells needing repairs, as well as to increase the capacity and
quality of well maintenance and workover to cope with the larger number and
more complex production wells as a result of the proposed project.
5.18     The final development of the light oil fields primarily involve one
or more of the following: infill drilling, introduction of artificial lift
equipment (gas lift and sucker rod pumps) and introduction of water injection
schemes or expansion of the schemes now in place. The main objective is to
increase production to the optimum level as early as possible. A total of
about 247 wells will be drilled under this sub-component which will provide
an incremental production of about 0.83 million tons per year of oil and about
91 million '3 per year of gas at peak level. The most important final
development scheme involves the Kalol field, which will require about 140 new
wells.
5.19     The Balol and Lanwa heavy oil fields, as well as the northern portion
of the Santhal field, which together have proven and probable reserves
(initial oil in place or IOIP) of about 55 million tons of oil, are not yet
developed at present. Primary production using heavy duty pumps is expected
to recover about 10% to 12% of the IOIP in North Santhal, 9% in Balol and 5%
in Lanwa respectively. The combined heavy oil production under the initial
field development scheme will be about 0.75 million tons per. year at the peak
level. About 287 wells will be drilled in these fields under the project.
Enhanced oil recovery based on in--situ combustion is expected to improve the
recovery up to about 40% to 50% oi the IOIP (para 5.22). Another objective of
the primary field development is cherefore to condition the reservoirs (i.e.,
reduce the pressures, etc.) for eventual application of this EOR technique.
Under the primary development, the wells will be designed for thermal service
and the well spacing will take into account the EOR requirements.
5.20     The Cambay gas field rehabilitation has two objectives: to arrest the
rapid decline in gas production caused by progressive abandonment of the old
wells (which cannot be repaired) following water enroachment; and to test the
apparently "tight" oil formation located below the gas producing zone. The
Cambay gas field has been in production since the early 1960's but about one-
half (1.5 billion m ) of the recoverable gas reserves still remain. Gas
production has declined substantially to 70,000 m /day at present but could
fall further to about one-half this level within a few years. Under the
project two or three gas wells will initially be drilled using special
techniques to take into account the depressed pressures (below hydrostatic) in
the gas zone. If successful, additional gas wells (up to about 10) will be
drilled to increase gas production to about 140,000 m /day. The initial
production tests of the lower oil zone conducted by ONGC in the early 1960's
were not successful and no other attempt to test or delineate this oil zone
has been made since. Under the project 4 wells will be drilled to test



- 26 -
several new well stimulation methods of oil production, and better estimate
the reserves and recovery that could be expected.
5.21     At present, about 130 to 150 wells in the Cambay Basin need to be
repaired each year which just about matches ONGC's workover capacity.
However, there is a backlog of about 345 wells which have been in need of
workover for sometime. The resulting lost production is estimated at about
300,000 to 400,000 tons per year of oil. ONGC plans to eliminate this backlog
over the next five years through the following: Firstly, workover operations
are now proceeding on a 24-hour basis. Secondly, a workover contract was
signed last year for two Soviet workover rigs (and crews) to repair 120 wells
within a three year period (1983-85). ONGC will handle the other 225 wells
during a five-year period (1983-1987). To accomplish this task and keep up
with the additional (about 110 wells more per year) and more complex workover
jobs that will result from the 548 new development wells to be drilled under
the proposed project, ONGC will need to replace most of its existing 23
workover rigs which are very old and, at the same time, increase its fleet to
about 30 to 35 workover rigs. Thus, thirdly, the acquisition of ten
replacement workover rigs and related equipment (e.g., wireline service units,
production logging units), as well as the cost of workover materials and
supplies for about 340 wells, are included in the proposed project. Fourthly,
ONGC whenever required, will utilize the technical assistance (para 5.26)
under the proposed project to help plan and undertake workover operations.
3.       Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) Component
5.22     Three EOR pilot schemes are included in the proposed project: two
thermal EOR pilots in the Lanwa heavy oil field and a polymer chemical flood
pilot in the Jhalora light oil field. Bank consultants have recommended these
among several proposed by ONC.
a.    In-situ Combustion (Lanwa Field)
5.23     The Lanwa field has the most viscous heavy oil among the oil fields
in the basin and will be the first to require a commercial EOR scheme within
about 4 to 6 years after primary development. A thermal EOR technique is
expected to increase oil recovery to about 45% of the initial oil in place
from only about 5% for primary production. The first thermal EOR pilot will
use the in-situ combustion technique. The second pilot, which will be started
about 18 to 24 months after the first, will use either the steam flood method
or the in-situ combustion method depending upon the initial results of the
first pilot. The Lanwa pilots, while specific to that field, will also serve
as prototypes for the Balol and Santhal pilot in-situ combustion schemes which
will follow about one to three years later. The in-situ combustion pilot is
expected to run for about four years.
b.    Polymer Flood (Jhalora Field)
5.24     The polymer flood pilot at the Jhalora field was recommended because
of the adverse mobility ratio and heterogeneous permeability profile of the
reservoir. The primary recovery of the Jhalora field is expected to be around
16% with cumulative production from 1977 up to the present already about 6% of
the initial oil in place (26.4 million tons). However, oil production has
begun to decline as the water cut increased from 20% two years ago to 30% at



- 27 -
present. An EOR scheme will therefore be needed within a few years to reverse
the decline in production and increase the recovery factor. The Jhalora
polymer pilot is also expected to last about four years and serve as a
prototype for the other light oil fields.
4.       Technical Training and Assistance Component
5.25     ONCC's field operations in the Cambay Basin have many serious
deficiencies and problems. One of the main objectives of the proposed project
is to improve ONGC's oil field operations through training, use of consultants
and contractors, and introduction of new technology, equipment and materials.
Each of these is described briefly below.
5.26     While ONGC has extensive training facilities and programs for
managerial and higher level technical staff, it lacks a meaningful training
program for field level employees. In the past, oil field workers have
learned through informal on-the-job apprenticeship. Last year, ONGC began a
modest oil field worker training facility near Ahmedabad in the Cambay
Basin. The program consisted of a six-week introductory course plus on-the-
job training. The facility has very limited training aids. ONGC, however,
has plans to build four or five large training centers around the country. A
training consultant attached to the Bank preappraisal mission reviewed ONGC's
existing and proposed training facilities and program and recommended a more
modest training center for the Cambay Basin, but with a more comprehensive
training curriculum. In addition, a major effort will be made to prepare and
develop the necessary training materials and train the instructors. This will
require the hiring of a training consultant to initially help ONGC organize
the planning and implementation of this training program. Training aids will
include simulators, iaboratory equipment, models and prototypes, closed
circuit TV system, etc. The training program will cover basic and advanced
courses in all facets of oil field operations (e.g., drilling, production,
cementing, various types of logging, pipelines, well stimulation, and
instrumentation).
5.27     Technical assistance will also be provided by an expatriate
consulting firm to assist in implementing the project and in improving ONGC's
field operations. Technical assistance will cover the application and
evaluation of EOR methods (in-situ combustion and chemical flooding), training
and whenever required may also cover r3servoir engineering, drilling
practices, mud engineering, workover techniques and formation testing. In
addition, the contracts with experienced international contractors for
drilling and technical well services (e.g. cementing, logging, production
testing) will have provisions for practical training of ONGC personnel.
5.28     The new equipment included in the proposed project is essential
towards modernizing and improving the efficiency of ONGC's onshore
operations. They are also required for ONGC to effectively undertake its
portion of the project's drilling program within a reasonable time.  The
equipment are for exploration, development and production as follows:
a.   coring equipment;
b.   three open hole electric logging units;
c.   two production logging units;
d.   fourteen production wire-line units;



- 28 -
e.   seven mud-logging units;
f.   five units (each 3 MW) of mobile gas turbine power
generators.
g.   field radio communications;
h.   ten workover rigs (discussed in para 5.21); and
i.   seven mobile drilling rigs.
5.29     ONGC presently does not have rig-site equipment to continuously
monitor downhole conditions, as well as drilling mud components and
hydrocarbons in the drilling fluid system. Also, ONGC rigs presently lack
formation coring tools to cut and retrieve the typically unconsolidated and
loose sands that predominate in many Cambay Basin fields. State-of-the art
electric logging units in the basin are limited in number and, often,
important exploratory wells are inadequately evaluated. Reliable and accurate
subsurface parameters, which are critical in determining reservoir
characteristics and essential in the design and implementation of any
secondary or enhanced oil recovery project, are not being measured
satisfactorily due to lack of proper logging and other equipment. As part of
the project, some critical equipment will be purchased to either provide
additional units or as replacement units to cover existing shortfalls and
deficiencies.
5.30     Of the 14 drilling rigs operating in the Cambay Basin at present, 12
are obsolete and should have been replaced a long time ago. As part of the
project, seven heavy duty mobile drilling rigs will be purchased to drill
ONGC's portion of the development wells included in the project. The new rigs
will replace the old rigs and should be similar to the contracted rigs
(para 5.34); they represent a new technology for ONGC. The rigs will
subsequently be used for infill drilling during the commercial scale EOR
projects in the heavy and the light oil fields that will follow the pilot
schemes in about 5 to 7 years. They will also be used for workover of the
deeper wells (2,000- 2,500 m) in the basin (e.g., Kalol). The rigs will
therefore be productively used in the project area for at least the next 10
years.
F. Project Implemenation
1.       Organization for Project Implementation
5.31     The project will be implemented by ONGC's Western Region.  However,
the project is a major and complex undertaking which will require logistical
and organizational support not presently available in the Western Region.
ONGC agreed with the appraisal mission on the general organizational
arrangements for project implementation. A separate project implemex.tation
unit has just been established. This project unit will have over-all
responsibility for the project as well as specific responsibility for
procurement, exploration and all activities involving contractors. The
existing field organization of ONGC will undertake all force account work
which will be coordinated by the project unit. The implementation of the
training program for field workers will be mainly the responsibility of the
headquarters (Dehra Dun) training department but will be implemented by a
regional training unit to be set-up for this purpose. The project unit will
have control over the resources needed by the project. ONGC has prepared a
project implementation plan and has already appointed the core staff for the



- 29 -
project unit. The remaining support staff will be appointed as needed
according to the implementation plan. These arrangements are satisfactory.
2.       ONGC and Contractor(s) Work Program
5.32     The seismic acquisition and data processing, and the drilling of the
four deep exploratory wells will be performed by international contractors.
However, in the past two years, the Government has imposed more strict
requirements and clearance procedures (on grounds of national security) for
the processing of seismic data by outside contractors. This has delayed some
of ONGC's recent seismic surveys. The appraisal mission was assured by ONGC,
and this was again confirmed during negotiations, that the necessary
clearances will be sought from the Government to process the data by
contract. In the unlikely event that this clearance is not granted,
alternatives satisfactory to the Bank (e.g. using contractor software and
personnel to process the data in ONGC's computers on a priority basis) will be
arranged by ONGC.
5.33     The appraisal mission informed ONGC that additional seismic
information and geological analyses should be performed for two of the
proposed four exploratory wells to determine precisely the most advantageous
spudding location. During the pre-appraisal mission, the Bank staff also
suggested, and ONGC agreed, that a detailed drilling program and a preliminary
completion program should be prepared before each well is spudded. ONGC
confirmed its agreement to all these during negotiations. Furthermore, the
Bank would review and ascertain that the best available methodology and data
had been used in selecting the sites, and that all pre-drilling studies and
surveys, as well as drilling plans, have been completed prior to drilling each
exploratory well.
5.34     Development drilling under the proposed project will be done partly
by foreign drilling contractors and partly by ONGC. About 204 wells will be
drilled by international drilling contractors, over a period of 3 years. The
drilling program is shown in Annex 5.4. The contracted rigs are expected to
act as "pacesetters" for ONGC rigs operating within the same area. The
remaining wells, about 344, will be drilled by ONGC using 9 to 10 of its own
rigs, including 7 to be purchased under the project. The development drilling
load of ONGC has been carefully determined to meet the requirements of
efficient and timely project implementation as well as the improvement in
ONGC's operating capabilities which is also a key objective of the project.
This drilling load is technically acceptable and the most effective
alternative for the following reasons: (i) ONGC can, with the technical
assistance, new equipment, and improved logistical support included in the
project, undertake part of the operations since it has been drilling and
producing in the basin for over twenty years where more than 1,300 wells have
been drilled thus possessing the requisite basic experience and management
capability; (ii) its normal annual drilling work program in the basin is
comparable to the initial drilling load under the project and this load has
been planned to increase at a reasonable rate during the course of project
implementation; (iii) ONGC Western Region would use the same established field
management teams and crews to continue the operations after the contractors
have completed their tasks under this project; (iv) the transfer of technology
and skills in oil field activities such as drilling and workover is better
accomplished if ONGC works side by side with the foreign contractors; and



- 30 -
(v) the alternative of contracting a larger portion of the drilling operations
would be substantially more costly. The total development drilling cost
(excluding materials and consumables) under the proposed arrangements is about
US$310 million. This would increase by about US$45 million (15%) if all
development drilling and technical well senrices required under the proposed
project were to be contracted.
5.35     During the preparation and preappraisal missions, Bank staff
recommended that ONGC change its casing policy for most of the wells to be
drilled under the project (and ONGC's onshore operations in general) with
respect to the use of a 5 1/4" production casing. Instead, a 7" production
casing should be used. ONGC agreed to this and during negotiations it was
determined that about 386 development wells and all exploration wells under
the project will use a 7" production casing. In addition, ONGC also agreed
that for the project only API certified or labeled oil field cement will be
used below a depth of 500 meters.
3.       Implementation Schedule
5.36     The project schedule is given in Annex 5.5.  It is anticipated that
development drilling would start during the second half of 1984 and end by
early 1990. Exploration drilling would start by late 1985 and be completed by
early 1988. The drilling contract along with the other auxiliary technical
well services such as wire-line logging and cementing would be procured by the
start of 1985 for a period of about 3 years. Procurement of most of the new
drilling and workover equipment should start not later than third quarter of
1984 and be fully operational by the beginning of 1986. There should be no
difficulty in meeting the completion targets given the lead time being
provided for procurement of contractors services, the reasonable work load to
be undertaken by ONGC and the use of experienced contractors and
consultants. Close coordination would be assured by a Project Manager in
charge of the project implementation unit and reporting directly to the
regional Group General Manager.
G. Project Cost Estimate
5.37     The total project financing requirement is estimated at about US$954
million, including physical and price contingencies and the front-end fee on
the Bank loan. The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$546 million
or 57% of the total project cost. The detailed estimated project costs are
shown in Annex 5.6 and shown by field and activity in Annex 5.7. They are
summarized below:

5.38     The cost estimate of the project was prepared by the Bank and ONGC in
April, 1983 and updated in November, 1983. The costs are expressed in late-
1983 prices. Prices are in line with the costs experienced in other Bank
projects in and outside India and are based on the following: (i) drilling
costs for development wells are based on wells of similar depth drilled in the
Cambay Basin while drilling costs for the deep exploration wells are based on
costs of similar wells in India (i.e., Krishna-Godavari Exploration Project);
(ii) seismic survey costs are estimated from comparable shallow water/tidal
seismic acquisition in other parts of the world as well as from recent
contractor bids for geophysical and data processing submitted to ONGC;
(iii) equipment costs are based on figures supplied to the Bank by ONGC and



- 32 -
cross-checked with costs experienced in other Bank projects outside of India;
(iv) technical well services (i.e. cementing, electric logging and formation
testing) are derived from offshore Bombay High and Krishna-Godavari Project
costs adjusted downwards for the onshore operations; (v) enhanced oil recovery
(EOR) pilot costs were estimated by consultants; (vi) the expected average
cost per man-month for training consultants is estimated at US$8,000 for
foreign consultants (30 man-months) and US$1,500 for local consultants (30
man-months), respectively, including travel, subsistence and overhead; and
(vii) technical consultants (70 man-months) are expected to average US$10,000
per man-month, including travel, subsistence and overhead. The phasing of
project expenditures is shown in Annex 5.8.
H. Financing Plan and Procurement
1.       Project Financing Plan
5.39     The proposed project represents about 5% of ONGC's overall investment
program of about Rs 194 billion (US$19.4 billion) and about 60X 1f the Cambay
Basin total investments of about RS 16 billion (US$1.6  billion>-  over
1984/85-1989/90.  The financing plan of ONGC's overall investment program,
discussed in para 6.09, indicates that internally generated funds will finance
about 632 of the overall investment program and loans 37Z. Of the total
borrowings, commercial banks are expected to provide about 63%, while
aggregate disbursements from the Bank (including the proposed loan) is
estimated to account for another 8%. Thus, Bank loans will finance about 3X
of ONGC overall investment, (corresponding to about 7% of the estimated
foreign exchange cost) during this period. For the proposed project, the ONGC
financing plan is based on the following main consideration: to cover as much
of the foreign exchange cost as possible with foreign loans while at the same
time have a proportion of loan financing and an average loan maturity
consistent with the overall corporate objective of keeping ONGC's future
debt/equity ratio, debt service coverage ratio and ability to quickly mobilize
large financial resources (in case of a major discovery), in line with western
oil industry practices (para 6.06). ONGC is also interested in having a
significant Bank involvement in key high priority projects for technical
reasons and to help maintain the good financial standing it has developed
among foreign commercial lenders following the Bank's first project with ONGC
in 1977. On this basis, ONGC intends to seek loan financing for the project
in the range of 502 to 55 of the financing required, of which almost one-half
would be covered by medium-term (e.g., 6 to 8 years) borrowings from
commercial sources.
5.40     Several of the foreign exchange cost items under the project are
suitable for financing by eximbank, suppliers or buyers credits. These
include arti.icial lift equipment, wellheads, casings, tubings and
accessories, and mobile power generators, which together have an estimated
value of about US$194 million. In this context, ONGC's approach to
cofinancing, adopted in late 1981, is that major bid packages are tendered
using global tendering procedures (i.e., ICB) with a request for financing
proposals; the financing offer is optional and is not a condition of bid
qualification. Bid evaluation is done by ONGC in accordance with the concept
of lowest evaluated bid used by the Bank (i.e., excluding financing offers).
1/ ONGC's overall investment program and investments in the Cambay Basin
during 1984/85-1989/90 are discussed in Annex 4.3.



- 33 -
It is only at the Government level just before the final decision to award is
taken that the financing proposals are evaluated in conjunction with the
commercial bid evaluation. At this time, the possibility exists that a good
financing offer from a bidder other than the lowest evaluated bidder is
accepted assuming that its combined commercial and financing offer indicates a
superior total package. However, practically all bid packages handled by ONGC
so far have been awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder because differences in
financing amounts and terms offered were not sufficiently significant to
affect the decision. In fact, in several cases, the award was given to a
bidder who did not offer any financing; in most cases, the financing offers
ranged from 40% to 80Z of the contract value. The entire amount or the
balance, as the case may be, was financed from free foreign exchange or a
subsequent commercial bank loan. ONGC will use this as one approach to
mobilize suppliers and eximbank credits for the proposed project.
5.41     ONGC is also expected to seek, at various times during the project
implementation period, Euro-currency loans, untied to procurement packages, to
help finance its overall investment program. mhe timing of such corporate
borrowings will depend on financial market conditions as well as on the
foreign exchange financing needs of the company. Parts of these Euro-currency
loans are expected to be used towards the financing of the proposed project to
the extent needed to cover the direct foreign exchange cost not financed by
eximbank, suppliers or buyers credits and the proposed Bank loan. In all,
about US$245 million in export credits and commercial bank co-financing is
expected for the project. Furthermore, ONGC informed the Bank that during the
next two years (1984/85 and 1985/86), commercial borrowings are expected to
total about US$400-450 million per year for ONGC as a whole.
5.42     The financing plan for the project is therefore expected to be as
follows:
Table 5.4: Project Financing Plan
US$ million     Z

a/ Commercial loans include eximbank, supplier's and buyer's
credits as well as Euro-currency loans.
b/ The expected disbursement profile for the Bank loan is shown
in Annex 5.9.
5.43     ONGC's contribution to the project's financing plan would represent
about 4% of its internal cash generation during the project implementation
period.  No problems are expected in mobilizing this amount for the project.
However, oil companies in general must be prepared to undertake large
development investments within relatively short notice in case of a major
discovery. ONGC's financial forecasts do not provide for such unforseen
investments which could increase ONGC's financing requirements substan-
tially. The financial forecasts could also be adversely affected by lower



- 34 -
than expected oil recovery factors or slower pace of development due to
imprecise geologic information inherent in all petroleum development
efforts. During negotiations therefore, agreement was reached with the
government that it will provide ONGC, or cause ONGC to be provided with
sufficient funds, including authorizing ONGC to seek co-financing to meet
ONGC's financ'al requirements for the project.
5.44     The proposed Bank loan amount of US$242.5 million was determined
after considering those items which are not generally financed by suppliers
credits (e.g. contractor and consultant services) and which, for technical and
quality considerations, are best financed by the Bank (para 5.45). The
proposed Bank loan would represent about 25% of the total, and 44% of the
foreign exchange, project cost. The loan would be made to GOI with a maturity
of 20 years including a five year grace period at the standard Bank variable
interest terms including a front-end fee of 0.25%. The Government would
onlend the proceeds of the loan to ONGC at an interest rate of at least 12%
(in line with GOI loan rates for public sector enterprises) with a maturity of
at most 15 years including a five-year grace period. The foreign exchange and
the interest rate risks would be borne by the Government. The onlending rate
is expected to exceed domestic inflation rates which are not likely to be over
8% annually in the next five years. In general, the onlending terms are
reasonable considering that: a significant proportion (14%) of the project
investments are for exploration, EOR pilots, and training which will yield
benefits only in the long-term; almost one-half of the loan financing is
medium-term (6 to 8 years for the commercial 'oans) which must be balanced by
longer-term financing to arrive at an average maturity that would be
consistent with ONGC's overall debt service level objectives in light of its
increasing capital requirements particularly for lo g-gestation investment
such as exploration; also, additional large investments will be needed after
about six to nine years for the commercial-scale EOR applications and for the
follow-up exploratory drilling in the Cambay Gulf area. Execution of the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan.
2.       Items Proposed for Bank Financing
5.45     As mentioned earlier, certain items in the project have been
determined as high priority for Bank financing and the proposed loan amount
was derived on the basis of their cost. These items were selected from those
that met the following criteria: (i) items that are not normally financed by
export credits; (ii) items most suitable for international competitive bidding
(ICB) and involvIng the minimum (if any) retroactive financing; (iii) items
whose technological and quality contents are critical to the technical success
of the project, including the technology transfer objectives of the Bank; and
(iv) items that will spread the Bank financial involvement throughout the
project implementation period as well as across all the major components of
the project. Based on these considerations, items listed in the table below
were judged the most appropriate for Bank financing. The first three groups
of items listed below (contractor and consultant services, training and EOR
pilot expenditures) are generally not financed by eximbank or suppliers
credits. However, ONGC has been successful in borrowing from the Euro-
currency markets for its overall corporate requirements and it would be
desirable to progressively reduce the share of Bank financing from the levels
of previous projects. It is therefore proposed that the Bank finance about 80%
of the cost of contractor services. In the case of the mobile drilling rigs
and workover rigs as well as the other equipment to upgrade existing ONGC rigs,
which are generally suitable for financing by eximbank or export credits,
financial involvement by the Bank is also essential to help ensure that: the



- 35 -
types and specifications of these equipment are-appropriate for the project; the
procurement will be timely to avoid delays in project implementation; the
objective of technology transfer and improvement in ONGC's drilling and workover
operations sought by the Bank is achieved as early as possible; and the Bank's
financial support is not limited to the activities of contractors, but also
covers the major part of the development drilling and workover operations being
undertaken by ONGC. The Bank's financial support covering about 50% of the cost
of the drilling and workover rigs and 1002 of the cost of the other equipment is
therefore recommended. In the case of cement, chemicals and additives, it is
recommended that the Bank finance all the API type "G" as well as the thermal
type of oilfield cement, and critical drilling mud chemicals because of the
severe cementing and drilling problems experienced in the Cambay Basin which, in
the Bank staff's judgement, are largely the result of using local cement and
chemicals which are not certified by the API. Bank financing will help ensure
that AP   -ade cement and materials are used by ONGC in this project.

5.47     About US$515 million worth of contractor services, equipment and
materials for the project will be procured through international competitive
bidding (ICB) and US$150 million worth of equipment, materials and supplies
will be purchased using local competitive bidding procedures (LCB) under which
foreign firms can also bid. The "other" procurement category includes: (a)
equipment and materials to be procured under limited international bidding
(LIB), estimated to cost about US$5.8 million; (b) foreign consultants to be
hired using Bank guio:lines and foreign training of ONGC personnel for which
no procurement method applies, together valued at about US$3.5 million; and
(c) CNGC force account expenditures (US$ 87 million), direct local purchases
from single or limited suppliers, e.g., diesel fuel for drilling (US$28.9
million), as well as the hiring of local consultants, together valued at about
US$128.8 million.
5.48     The number of procurement packages to be procured under ICB and LIB
procedures will be about 42 as follows:
(a)    Contractor Services - About seven packages covering:  seismic
data acquisition and processing; exploration drilling;
development drilling; wire-line electric logging; cementing and
drill stem testing; mud logging and mud engineering; and
directional drilling (if needed).
(b)    Oilfield Equipment - About twelve packages covering: drilling
rigs (2); workover rigs; special coring equipment; production
logging units; open hole electric logging units; open and cased
hole production wire line service units; mud logging units;
mobile electric generators; and field radio communication (2).
(c)    Well Equipment, Materials and Consumables - About twenty-three
packages covering: casing and tubing; drilling and casing bits;
wellheads and production christmas trees; artificial lift and
production bottom hole equipment; mud products and drilling
chemicals (2); floating equipment; oil fie'ld cement (3); cement
additives (2); liner hangers; EOR equipment (compressors, pumps,
etc. - 4 packages); EOR chemicals (polymer, etc. 2 packages);
and training equipment (4).
5.49     Items to be financed by the Bank will be grouped whenever possible
into contracts valued at US$300,000 or more (CIF basis) and such packages will
be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with
Bank guidelines. A margin of preference equal to 15% of the C.I.F. bid price
of imported goods or the actual customs duties and import taxes, whichever is
lower, will be allowed for domestic manufacturers. Similarly, a domestic
preference of 7.5% will be allowed for local contractors for works (i.e.
drilling and cementing services). Bid pa..kages for equipment and materials
costing less than US$300,000 (CIF), or items from a limited number of
qualified suppliers, or those whose delivery periods are critical to the
timely completion of the project, will be purchased through limited
international bidding (LIB) with quotations being solicited from at least four
suppliers from three different countries. The total LIB purchasers for
equipment and materials will not exceed US$6 million. Consultants for
traininng and technical assistance financed by the Bank will be selected in
accordance with Bank guidelines. All service and equipment contracts over



- 38 -
US$1 million each (about 15) will be subject to prior Bank review. Bank
review will cover 95% of the value of service contracts and about 80% of the
value of equipment and materials to be financed by the Bank. Other contracts
will be subject to selective post-award review. Retroactive financing for up
to US$2 million for expenditures after September 1, 1983 will be allowed to
cover costs for consultancy, services and equipment procured after project
appraisal.
I. Ecology and Safety
5.50     Coastal seismic data acquisition will take place in a sparsely
populated, and lightly utilized area. Geophysical survey lines and subsequent
exploratory drilling locations would be selected to avoid close proximity to
habitation and water wells. All water aquifers, including surface source
water, will be protected by following oil well drilling standards set by the
industry. ONGC will contain and clean up any drilling mud and chemical
contamination that would originate on the ground surface adjacent to
drillsites in holding pits or dump reservoirs. Drilling a number of
development wells entails some risk of surface blow-outs and the possibility
of fire. The risk is, however, minimized through the use of blow-out
preventers and sophisticated equipment introduced in the mud logging unit
(which can monitor traces of gas coming out of the hole). The ONGC Western
Region, in spite of some inefficiencies in its oil field operations, is quite
aware of the risks involved and has for years maintained an excellent safety
record.
5.51     The by-products and chemicals used in the EOR schemes have been
investigated and their presence is not judged to be a safety hazard or harmful
to the environment. The production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is possible with
any oil production operation. If H.2S is found to be present in the produced
gases in the in-situ combustion pilot, plans are to be made to incinerate the
gas and render it suitable for discharge into the atmosphere. The polymer to
be used in the EOR chemical flood is not toxic. However, the monomer from
which the polymer is made is toxic. It may exist in minute concentrations in
a polymer supply. However, the monomer is quite reactive and should disappear
quickly. During negotiations, agreement was obtained that ONGC take
precautions in line with industry practice to protect workers and the
environment during the implementation of the project and during operation of
the project facilities.
J. Project Risks
5.52     As described earlier (para 5.11), the major concept supporting the
project is that exploration and exploitation investments in a near mature
hydrocarbon producing basin are often among the lower cost and lower risk
opportunities available to establish additional proven reserves. The infill
drilling of undeveloped and underdeveloped fields and the implementation of
the EOR pilot schemes, two major components of the project, represent the
lower risk opportunities available in the basin. The project's exploration
component is more risky but the risks are difficult to quantify. In the case
of the seismic program, not enough is known of the subsurface under the
shallow waters of the Gulf to permit a statement of unqualified success;
similarly, in the case of the exploration drilling program, there is not
enough data to perform a meaningful economic risk analysis. Justification for



- 39 -
both these exploratory components rests with an assessment of their technical
and geological risks and a judgement of the benefits to be acquired from their
successful completion (para 7.01). A summation of these factors as they apply
to the exploration component is as follows:
l.       Seismic Program
5.53     Seismic recording in the Gulf of Cambay shallow water and tidal
environm-ent will require unconventional, advanced recording devices, tools and
techniques. The methods to record a seismic program of this type have been
performed under similiar conditions throughout the world, and although still
considered very specialized, the technical risk factors associated with data
acquirition will be minimized by engaging a foreign contractor experienced in
this mode of data collection. Geologically, the areas contiguous and nearby
to the Dahej gas discovery and associated Ankleshvar features are expected to
extend known structures and inferred sandstone reservoirs along established
northeast-southwest trends. However, further away from present subsurface
well control, the geologic risk rises. Under the waters of the Cambay Gulf
and in the remote portions of the tidal-swept areas to the south and to the
west, the geologic risk is that the established onshore structural fault
trends and the sandstone patterns intepreted for the Narbada delta may not
persist. In addition, although Niocene hydrocarbons have been encountered in
the Hazira and offshore Tapti locations, seismic and subsurface well control
is insufficient to delineate the origin of the reservoir beds or predict the
exact position of the inferred structural faulting.
2.       Exploratory Drilling
5.54     The technical risks in drilling the four deep exploratory wells is
that the holes may not be evaluated and tested effectively due to downhole or
mechanical rig problems. The principal causes of this would be high
boctomhole temperatures, abnormal formation pressures or impenetrable zones
which could not be handled by ONGC's own rig equipment. To reduce these
technical risks, it has been decided to employ an expatriate drilling
contractor experienced in drilling through and evaluating deep high
temDerature/pressure exploratory wells. Geologically, the four exploratory
wells are primarily designed to test deep prospects in zones which have
indicated hydrocarbon reservoirs in prior drilling, and secondarily to
evaluate prospects in even deeper less explored stratigraphic intervals. But,
due to the limited reliable geologic data about these deep zones, it is
difficult at this stage to assign a meaningful risk factor on this drilling.
5.55     It is the conclusion of ONGC and the Bank that the technical risks
attached to the exploration component of the project have been reduced by
engaging outside international contractors. The geological risks of the
seismic program will be justified considering the high probability of
identifying additional structures and fault closures in the Gulf. The
geological risks assigned to the exploratory drilling can also be justified if
new, potentially productive deep zones are identified within the basin.
K. Reporting Requirements
5.56     In order to allow the Bank to reach an informed judgement on the
progress of the project, agreement was reached during negotiations that ONGC



- 40 -
will provide the Bank bi-monthly telexes summarizing the exploration drilling
status, including ca;ing, cementing, testing and all other auxillary
services. Quarterly progress reports covering technical progress of the
seismic work, development and exploration drilling, workover, well location
preparation, procurement s':atus, and funds committed/spent should also be
provided. Interim and final well completion and testing results would be
incorporated in the quarterly progress report when these are completed (para
4.07). Duriag negotiations, agreement was reached with ONGC on the formats
and contents of the periodic reports to be submitted to the Bank.
VI. - FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
6.01     ONGC's financial and accounting systems, while governed by GOI
regulations, are similar to those of a commercial oil company. However, key
financial parameters (selling prices, investment programs, external
borrowings) are either decided (e.g. oil prices) or subject to review and
approval by GOI. Within this framework, ONGC has operated in a responsible
and reasonably autonomous fashion. ONGC is in a sound financial positicn and
is expected to remain so in the future.
A. Main Issues and Bank Objectives in ONAGC's Finances
6.02     In lending to ONGC the Bank has supported ONGC's policy to rely on
internal cash generation, i.e., reasonable profits and depreciation charges,
to finance a substantial portion of its financing requirements for capital
investments and increases in net working capital. This has been achieved by
periodic increases in the price of oil and gas. The Bank has also encouraged
ONGC to progressively diversify its sources of external financing. Since
1977/78, ONGC has increasingly utilized commercial sources to finance
development expenditures while practically eliminating its reliance on
government borrowings or equity contributions (as shown in the table below).
After the government raised the crude oil price in July 1981 (para 3.05),
ONGC's after-tax profit per barrel of oil (and oil equivalent of gas) has
improved from about US$1/Bbl in 1979/80 to about $4/Bbl in 1982/83 and in
1983/84 (estimated) and for the last three years has been in line with the
average for the western oil industry (US$3 to 4/Bbl). ONGC's internal cash
generation after debt service payments, as a proportion of capital investments
has also increased to the level of 50% to 60% in recent years, and is
projected to remain at 55% or higher over the next six years. Again, this
compa es satisfactorily with the western oil industry average of about
70% _ However, unlike large integrated oil companies, ONGC's opportunities
for diversifying its reserve base and production are limited and its future
profitability will depend largely on the success of current exploration and
11 The western (private) international oil companies generally use "off-
balance sheet" financing methods, e.g., project financing, to finance some
investments, particularly large infrastructure types (e.g., Alaska
pipeline). Thus, the large loans associated with these investments do not
appear in the company's balance sheet. This improves the reported debt equity
ratio (about 20:80 on average) and the reported proportion (about 70%) of
investments financed from internal cash generation. On the other hand, ONGC
does not use "off-balance sheet" financing methods.



- 41 -
enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, while the Bank will continue to pursue
the two objectives of adequate cash generation and diversified borrowings, it
will also increasingly monitor ONGC's debt/equity ratio, which could approach
prudent limits (i.e., 60:40) within a few years; its capacity to sustain, over
an extended period if necessary, its major exploration and development
investments, and its ability to move rapidly to finance the early stages of
develGpment following any commercial discovery. The Bank will also encourage
ONGC to ensure that the blend of maturities and grace periods of its medium
and long-term loans result in a reasonable pattern of overall debt service
payments.

B.       ONUC - Financial Performance and Forecasts
6.03     ONGC's accounting practices are described in Annex 6.1.  Its Income
Statements, Balance Sheets and Sources of Funds Statements over 1979/80 -
1983/84 and financial projections over 1983/84-1988/89 are shown in Annex 6.2.
The financial projections are based on a number of important assumptions,
inter alia, that (i) the price of crude oil and natural gas to ONGC will
remain at present levels until 1987/88 when it will be increased by 10Z to
enable ONGC to maintain an adequate return on its assets and be in a position
to finance about 60% of its investment program through cash generation; (ii)
all of ONGC's external financing requirements would be met by borrowing so
that GOI will no longer be required to provide equity or loan financing; (iii)
development investments will be limited to presently known reserves, and no
additional production from new oil or gas discoveries was assumed during the
period under review; and (iv) exploration investments will cover the full
accelerated exploration program approved in the Core Plan (para 4.10). The
following table summarizes ONGC's past financial performance and the trends
that are expected to develop during the life of the project.

6.04     ONGC's profitability and cash generation has improved considerably
since 1981/82 as a result of higher oil prices starting in July 1981 (para
3.05) and, more importantly, higher levels of oil production from the Bombay
High field. Oil production doubled from 9.2 million tons in 1980/81 to 18.4
million tons in 1982/83. It is forecast to reach about 27 million tons in
1984/85 and then peak at about 30 million tons by 1988/89 on the basis of all
presently known reserves, primarily the Bombay High field. However, while oil
production is expected to level off in future years, assets will continue to
grow, reflecting ONGC's large investment program which covers equipment
acquisition, infrastructure for gas (e.g. transmission lines) and secondary
recovery at Bombay High which is intended to maintain production at its peak



- 43 -
level. On the other hand, gas production will increase and provide additional
revenues. Nonetheless, the rate of profitability is expected to temporarily
decline from about 28% of assets employed in 1982/83 to about 11% in 1986/87
and then gradually improve to 16% by 1988/89. The decline in profits in
1986/87 is primarily an accounting and tax phenomenon. ONGC is expected in
that year to start operations of several major facilities and this would allow
it to claim investment tax credits through additional depreciation and
depletion charges. This would lower reported income and hence, income taxes
as well. The cost of these facilities in turn, are transferred from
investments under construction to fixed assets in operation in ONGC's balance
sheet which initially lowers the reported return on assets. Finally the level
of investments in 1985/86 and 1986/87 are expected to be substantially higher
than the preceeding or subsequent years and this causes the self-financing
proportion to also decline slightly during both these years. Internal cash
generation, however, is expected to remain satisfactory at more than 55% of
investment requirements but the debt/equity ratio will approach prudent limits
within a few years before improving again. The debt service coverage ratio
could also gradually fall to about 2.7 times but would still be satisfactory
by the end of the decade. The current ratio will remain close to the minimum
prudent level but will still be acceptable considering that ONGC uses the
"last-in, first-out" (LIFO) inventory valuation method which understates the
value of its inventories, and current ratio, during periods of rising prices
as is presently the case. Overall, the financial situation projected for the
second half of the decade is considered satisfactory but will require close
monitoring of key financial indicators.
6.05     ONGC's debt/equity ratio is about 40:60 at present.  While this ratio
is low compared to other industries, it is higher than that of international
oil companies.  However, ONGC's debt structure includes large loans from the
government as well as foreign multilateral and bilateral loans made through
GOI which are longer-term (e.g., 15 years or more), have longer grace periods
and therefore, in evaluating ONGC's financial structur?, should not be
considered on the same basis as commercial borrowings.    Overall, ONGC's
financial structure can be considered satisfactory and should remain so if the
company continues to follow prudent borrowing practices. At present, ONGC
intends to maintain its current ratio at 1.3 times or higher, its debt/equity
ratio at not more than 60:40, and to keep such a blend of medium-term (6 to 9
years) commercial loans and longer-term loans (10 to 15 years) that would
maintain its debt service coverage ratio at not less than 1.5 times. The Bank
supports these objectives and during negotiations, agreement was reached with
ONGC that it will follow normally accepted prudent financial practices and to
this end shall maintain its current ratio, debt/equity ratio and debt service
coverage ratio at satisfactory levels.
6.06     Although generally conservative, the financial projections are based
on the premise that the expected increase in oil and gas production from
presently known reserves under development is realized and, in particular,
that such major development programs as the Bombay High secondary recovery and
the development of the South Bassein gas field are implemented on time and
produce petroleum at expected levels. The risks that these development
1/ The major borrowings of ONGC to date are shown in Annex 6-3.



- 44 -
programs will be delayed (particularly the secondary recovery in Bombay High
which is the first such undertaking by ONGC and will account for the sustained
oil production between 1984/85 and 1988/89), or that the productivity of the
reservoirs will be less than expected, do not appear to be high but cannot be
ruled out. Finally, the projections already indicate a risk of a potential
deterioration in profitability by the late 1980's.
6.07     Because of these risks, agreement was reached during negotiations
that: (i) GOI will, from time to time, carry out a review of the prices of
crude oil and natural gas paid to ONGC, and shall set such prices at a level
needed to enable ONGC, under conditions of efficient operation, to meet its
operating expenses and earn a sufficient return after taxes on assets employed
in operation, meet its debt service requirements, maintain adequate working
capital and finance a substantial portion of its proposed capital investments;
and (ii) ONGC will submit annually to GOI an analysis of its financial
situation as a basis for setting ONGC's selling prices. Such analysis will
include, inter alia, a financial evaluation of the proposed project and of any
subsequent commercial-scale EOR investment or other major development
investment in the Cambay Basin ; this evaluation will indicate the level of
prices required for ONGC to earn a discounted cashflow (DCF) return after
tPxes of at least 15% on the project and on any related subsequent major
duvelopments. Similar coverLants were applied under the two Bombay High loans
and the South Bassein loan. They have been complied with and led to the major
revision of petroleum prices in July 1981.
C. Financing of ONGC Investment Program (1984/85-1989/90)
6.08     ONGC's financing plan over the 1984/85-1989/90 period can be
summarized as follows:
Table 6.3: ONGC Financing Plan 1984/85-1989/90
Rs billion      Percent
Investment Program                     194.3           100

Financed by
Internal Cash Generation           122.0           63
GOI Equity Contributions              -             -
Foreign Commercial Borrowings       44.3           23
World Bank Loans                     5.9             3
Other Loans                         22.1            11
As the above table indicates, internal cash generation from operations is
expected to cover an average of 63% of investment requirements during the next
six years. Given the risk of a slower than anticipated build-up in revenues,
ONGC's decision to maintain a relatively low gearing ratio is advisable and
prudent. This is particularly important since, as mentioned earlier, there is
also a possibility that, in the event of large discoveries, ONGC would need to
seek heavy borrowings to finance additional development costs.
6.09     World Bank funds shown as part of long-term borrowings in the above
table reflect expected disbursements under the Krishna-Godavari and South
Bassein loans as well as under the proposed loan for the Cambay Basin
Petroleum Project. Altogether, Bank disbursements would represent about 8% of



- 45 -
ONGC's additional borrowings and 7% of its foreign exchange needs during the
1984/85-89/90 period. In addition, ONGC is expected to finance about 50X of
its future foreign exchange requirements from commercial borrowings. No major
difficulties are anticipated in mobilizing such large commercial borrowings,
provided ONGC's financial performance remains satisfactory. ONGC's long-term
outlook will depend on the success of the exploration and enhanced recovery
programs currently being implemented or pianned, its success in marketing
large quantities of natural gas which is expected to become a significant
source of income in the 1990's, and finally on the continuation of the
Government's policy of adjusting oil and gas prices periodically within
economic limits. The covenants attached to the proposed loan and the
continuing dialogue between the Bank and ONGC concerning its investment
program and financing plan should help ensure that ONGC's financial situation
remains sound in the long-term.
D. Financial Rate of Return of Development Components
1.       Financial Rate of Return
6.10     The development and production components (excluding workover) of the
proposed project have a combined financial rate of return of about 18X after
taxes (Annex 6.4) and a payback period of about 8 years (including the five-
year implementation period). Based on present price levels the financial rate
of return of the individual development components range from 15% to 26%.
Sensitivity analyses indicate that the financial return on these components is
sensitive to several risk factors. A 20% increase in capital cost, a 20%
decrease in revenues or a one-year delay in production would result in a
return of 11X, 12% or 13%, respectively, for the development component taken
as a whole, whic.. would still be acceptable. A combination of all these three
factors, however, would cause the financial rate of return to drop to 5%. The
project's cash generation and debt service capacity immediately following the
development of the light oil fields (i.e. 1986/87) will be satisfactory and
its cash position (after principal repayments) is expected to be positive at
all times. Cash generation, however, is also quite sensitive to the various
risk factors. In the case of a 20% increase in capital costs or of a cne year
delay in production, the project would not be able to service its debt until
year 5 (i.e. 1988/89) - two yeArs later than in the base case.
2.       Utilization of Heavy Oil
6.11     The total heavy oil production from the Cambay Basin is expected to
increase as a result of the project from 0.25 million tons per year at present
to at least 1 million tons per year by the end of the decade. Heavy oil
production will eventually be two to three times this level once a commercial
scale enhanced oil recovery (EOR) scheme is implemented during the 1990s. At
present, the Koyali refinery in Gujarat can only absorb about 0.5 million tons
per year of heavy oil. However, ONGC is presently constructing a 12" oil
pipeline (50km) from Kalol to the Salaya-Mathura crude oil pipeline which
would allow transport of light and heavy oil from the northern Cambay Basin to
the Mathura refinery in Uttar Pradesh starting in mid-1984. As the Mathura
refinery can also handle only a moderate volume of heavy oil at present, the
Ministry of Energy has indicated that it will study utilization alternatives
for the heavy oil. Given the lead time available (4 to 5 years), no
difficulties are expected in utilizing the additional heavy oil production



- 46 -
from the projecL. Nonetheless, advance planning is essential. Agreement was
reached during negotiations to the effect that GOI will (i) undertake a heavy
oil utilization study, to be completed by March 1985, and (ii) Lake the
necessary steps to ensure the utilization or sale of the heavy oil from Lhe
Cambay Basin.
VII - ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Justification for Exploratlion Component
7.01     ONGC, with the assistance of Soviet experLs, has evaluated several
times the petroleum potential of Lhe Cambay Basin, more recently in J978/79.
This latest evaluation concluded that roughly up to 40% of potential petroleum
resources in the basin, or about 350 million toe of in-place reserves remained
to be discovered. A significant proportion of undiscovered petroleum would be
in isolaLed small pools as shown by the pattern of discoveries to date.
However, a major proportion is expected to be found, in the Cambay Gulf area
as well as in the deeper horizons (4,000-5,500m), in pools that would be
economic to exploit. In accordance with these conclusions, ONGC is embarking
on a substantial exploration effort in the basin. During 1984/85-1989/90, iLs
overall exploration and appraisal effort in *he basin is presently planned to
be at least about US$400 million of which about US$112 million will be
contribuLed by the proposed project. Moreover, there is a provision to
increase this total to about US$600 million to cover further exploratory as
well as appraisal drilling should the exploration component of the proposed
projecL prove encouraging. If this expanded (US$600 million) total efforL
discovers (and proves) one-quarter of the prognosticated remairning potential,
which is a reasonable assumption, and of this about 28Z is recoverable (the
present basin-wide average recovery facLor), then the additional recoverable
reserves generated would be about 25 million toe. The incremental finding
COst would be about US$24 per toe (US$3.3/Bbl). Development and production
costs in the Gulf of Cambay or for the deep reservoirs in the basin, assuming
the petroleum reservoirs will be similar in size to the basin average, is not
expected to be more than US$25/toe (US$3.5/Bbl). Since the geologic risks are
moderate in a mature petroleum basin such as Cambay and the technical risks
have been minimized (paras 5.52 through 5.55), the overall economics for
further exploration are favorable and justify ONGC's planned exploration
effort in the basin.
B. Justification for Enhanced Oil Recovery Pilot Schemes
7.02     The primary development of the heavy oilfields (North Santhal, Salol
and Lanwa) is only expected Lo recover 5% to 12% of IOIP. Nonetheless, the
economic rate of return for this primary development is satisfactory at 53Z
(para 7.06). An EOR scheme, namely in-situ combustion, is expected to
increase the recovery rate to about 40Z-50X of IOIP. The development and
production cost for a commercial scale in-situ combustion scheme in the heavy
oil fields will be substantial, but the expected large incremental recovery
(30%-40X of IOIP) will more than compensate for the large costs; the economic
rate of return for a commercial scale operation is expected to exceed 40Z.
Thermal EOR techniques (in-situ combustion and steam flood) are commercially
proven methods and are expected to be economically viable for the Cambay Basin
heavy oil fields. The piloL EOR schemes are primarily to opLimize the field
design and more precisely determine the incremental recovery, rather than
establish the basic economic viability of the process.



- 47 -
7.03     The polymer EOR pilot on the other hand is more speculative because
commercial-scale polymer EOR projects are presently risky undertakings. While
polymer EOR techniques are technically proven, there are only few commercial
applications at present. The main reason for this is the high cost of polymer
which would make the technique of marginal economic value if the incremental
recovery is only moderate. Thus, in reservoirs where the primary recovery is
relatively high and leaves a smaller proportion of IOIP for EOR methods to
extract, polymer EOR schemes are not economic at present levels of polymer and
oil prices. In the case of the Jhalora field, the primary recovery factor is
expected to be about 16% of IOIP, which would indicate a potentially large
incremental recovery (15%-25X) for an appropriate EOR method. This could make
a commercial-scale EOR scheme economic in the Jhalora field. Thus, the
purpose of the polymer pilot is to test the basic economic feasibility of a
polymer EOR scheme. Since the pilot will last about four years, commercial-
scale application will take place only at the end of the decade or the early
1990's and, by that time, the price of polymer relative to the price of oil is
expected to have decreased; this provides added impetus for undertaking the
pilot scheme now.
C. Economic Rate of Return of Development Components
1.       Economic Rate of Return
7.04     A rate of return has been calculated for the development component
(excluding workover) of the project as a whole as well as for each of the four
main sub-components included therein: (a) development of the Kalol field; (b)
development of other light oil fields (North-Kadi, South-Kadi, Nawagan and
Sobhasan); (c) development of heavy oil fields (North-Santhal, Balol and
Lanwa); and (d) rehabilitation of the Cambay gas field.  The benefits of the
project are taken to be the savings from displacement of crude oil and fuel
oil imports resulting from the incremental production of crude oil and natural
gas respectively. All investment costs are expressed in mid-1983 prices. The
base case economic analysis assumes that the economic price of oil and gas
will remain constant in real terms during the life of the project. The
following parameters were used:
Light oil price:           US$29/Bbl or US$232/ton
Heavy oil price:           US$26/Bbl or US$173/tyn
Gas price                  US$162/thousand Nm  1,
7.05     At a 10% discount rate, the net present value of the development
component is US$1.1 billion. The overall incremental output of crude (14.5
million toe over sixteen years) represents a saving in oil imports of US$2.9
billion at mid-1983 prices. Moreover, the present value of incremental
production during the first five years (3.4 million toe) would roughly cover
the total economic cost of development activities including physical
contingencies.
1/ The economic value of the gas is based on the calorific equivalent of fuel
oil. On the basis of US$J80 per ton of fuel oil, the equivalent value of the
gas is US$162/thousand Nm .



- 48 -
7.06     The economic rate of return of the development component as a whole
is estimated at 91%, the return on sub-components ranging from 46% to 180%
(para 7.07). A high rate of return is not unusual for an oil development
project with a long history of sunk costs as is the case here for the light
oil fields in North Gujarat, the development of which started in the 1960's
(ERR=183%). The economic rate of return for the primary development of the
heavy oil fields is lower (53%) but still satisfactory. Returns on tertiary
recovery of heavy oil (expected to be implemented during the 1990s) is also
expected to be satisfactory.
2.       Sensitivity Analysis
7.07     Sensitivity analyses were conducted for several alternative assump-
tions, including the case where the economic price (i.e. international price)
of oil initially declines in real terms then begins to increase by about 2%
annually in real terms after 1985. The results, shown in the table below,
suggest that the economic rate of return of the project should remain
satisfactory under even moderately adverse circumstances. Sensitivity
analysis also suggests that the price of oil would have to drop to US$11/bbl
for the project to give a return of 20%.

VIII. - AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMENDATIONS
8.01     During negotiations, agreement was reacHed with the Government that:
(a)    it will provide ONGC or cause ONGC to be provided with
sufficient funds to meet ONGC's financial requirements for the



- 49 -
project. In this context the Government will authorize ONGC to
seek co-financing for the project (para 5.43);
(b)    it will onlend the Bank funds to ONGC on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank (para 5.44);
(c)    it will, from time to time, carry out a review of the prices of
crude oil and natural gas to ONGC, which will determine the
level of prices required to meet its operating expenses and earn
a rate of return on its assets employed in operations sufficient
to meet its debt service requirements, maintain adequate working
capital, and finance a substantial portion of its proposed
capital investments (para 6.07); and
(d)    it will undertake a heavy oil utilization study, to be completed
by March 1985 and take the necessary steps to ensure the
utilization or sales of the heavy oil from the Cambay Basin
(para 6.11).
8.02     ONGC confirmed the following during negotiations:
Ca)     it will obtain Government approval to have a foreign contractor
process the seismic data acquired under the project or otherwise
make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the timely
processing of the seismic data (para 5.32);
Cb)    it will complete all the necessary pre-drilling studies and
survey's using the best data and methodology available and then
prepare a detailed drilling program as well as a preliminary
completion program satisfactory to the Bank, before drilling
each exploration well included in the project (para 5.33); and
Cc)    it will follow the well casing policy, as well as use the type
and quality of oil field cement agreed with the Bank for the
wells to be drilled under the project (para 5.35).
8.03     The following agreements were reached with ONGC during negotiations:
(a)    periodic project progress reports and ONGC financial reports
will be submitted to the Bank during the project implementation
period; a Project Completion report will also be submitted
(paras 4.07 and 5.56);
(b)    ONGC's audited accounts will be submitted to the Bank not later
than twelve months after the end of the fiscal year (para 4.08);
(c)    it will take precautions in line with industry practices to
protect workers and the environment during the implementation of
the project at., .uring the operation of the project facilities
(para 5.51);
(d)    it will maintain its current ratio, debt/equity ratio, and debt
service coverage ratio at satisfactory levels (para 6.05); and



- 50 -
(e)    it will submit each year to the Government a report containing
an analysis of the financial situation of ONGC including a
financial evaluation of the development components included
under the project, which will indicate the level of prices which
would be required by ONGC to earn a DCF return after taxes of at
least 15% for the development component and any subsequent
commercial scale EOR application in the Cambay Basin as well as
other major development projects (para 6.07).
8.04     Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and ONGC with
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of loan
effectiveness (para 5.44).
8.05     Based on the agreements reached on the points listed above, the
project would be suitable for a US$242.5 million loan to GOI for a term of
twenty years, including a five-year grace period.

ONGC Investment Program
Background
1.       ONGC is now in the fourth year of the five-year plan period 1980/81-
84/85. The initial plan document (June 1980) provided for expenditures of
approximately Rs 40 billion (at 1980 prices). It was revised in August 1981
and again in August 1982 in order to incorporate the accelerated programs for
exploration and the final development of the Bombay High field; outlays were
increased accordingly to Rs 71 billion (at current prices). The production
target over the plan period was increased from 51.3 million tons of crude oil
to 91.6 million tons.
2.       In March 1982, ONGC completed a 10-year conceptual planning exercise
over the period 1980/81-89/90 where two scenarios are presented: Variant I
has an annual production objective of 46.5 million tons of crude oil by
1989/90, while Variant II has an objective of 60.5 million tons annually in
the same year. Since ONGC's existing reserves cannot sustain a production
rate above 30 million tons per annum, both scenarios assume that increased
exploration expenditures would yield commercial discoveries which will start
producing in the second half of the 1980's.
3.       ONGC recognizes that in order to accelerate its exploration program
during the seventh plan period (1985/86-89/90), additional exploration and
development expenditures will have to be incurred between 1983/84 and 1984/85
so that when the seventh plan begins, it will have adequate materials and
equipment, trained personnel and resources to achieve its objectives. One
should note, however, that the Government has not yet approved ONGC's recom-
mendations. In November 1982 the Government approved, in princivle, all the
exploration components as well as the development of presently known reserves
proposed in Variant I, but did not approve the speculative portion of the
development investments dealing with future (expected) discoveries. These
types of development investments will be proposed by ONGC as the discoveries
are actually made. The GOI-approved plan is now known as the Core Plan. This
Core Plan has been used for the purposes of the financial projections over the
period 1982/83-1989/90. The investment program which appears at the end of
this Annex has been used as an input for the financial projections (Annex
6.1). It should be considered as the broad outline of an expenditure program
which could be, at relatively short notice, significantly altered, for
instance, on account of reservoir studies (which would lead to additional
investments in producing areas) or commercial discoveries.
Exploration
a.   Onshore
4.       The Western Region includes the Cambay, the Rajasthan, the Saurashtra
and the Kutch basins; but only the Cambay basin has been fairly well
explored. The region's recoverable oil reserves are estimated at 113.6
million tons as of 1/1/82 (51.5 million tons as of 1/1/81). The exploration



ANNEX 4.3
59 -                             Page 2 of 4
strategy adopted here is to: (i) locate extensions of prospects already
delineated; (ii) identify subtle traps in different basement blocks on the
basis of sophisticated seismic work and geological modelling; and
(iii) explore new areas such as the shoal project in the Cambay Gulf, Kutch,
Saurashtra and Rajasthan. Deeper prospects in the existing known areas are
also to be drilled. During the period 1982/83-1987/88, ONGC plans to carry
out about 22,230 line-km of seismic surveys and drill 200 wells (about 490,000
meters).
5.       The Eastern Region (Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, etc.) is considered
very prospective. Recoverable oil reserves were estimated at 61.4 million
tons as of 1/1/82 (50.0 million tons as of 1/1/81). More than 40 prospects
identified from seismic and geological surveys are yet to be drilled. Virgin
areas such as Dansiri Valley, Naga Hills, and the north bank of Brahmaputra
are planned for drilling. 14,600 line-km of seismic surveys are planned
during the 1982/83-87/88 period, together with 156 exploratory wells (alto-
gether 580,000 m).
6.       In the Central Region, which comprises the balance of the onshore
area, no commercial discoveries have been made so far, but a number of attrac-
tive prospects have been identified, including the basins of Bengal, Krishna-
Godavari and Cauvery. ONGC also plans to initiate exploration efforts in new
areas (Himalayan foothills - Ganga Valley) and is in the process of acquiring
modern equipment for that purpose (digital seismic units, equipment designed
for desert conditions, etc.). 47,900 line-km of seismic surveys are now
proposed in the 1982/83-87/88 period, together with 186 exploratory wells
(744,000 m).
b.    Offshore
7.       Offshore exploration activities have given very encouraging results
in recent years. In 1981, a new structure known as B-57 has been discovered
south-east of the Bassein field. On the east coast, oil has been discovered
for the first time in a new structure in the Palk Straits known as PH-9.
Offshore recoverable oil reserves are estimated at 345.8 million tons as of
1/1/82 (328.3 million tons as of 1/1/81). The objective of the exploration
program here is to complete the seismic reconnaissance and semi-detailed
surveys of most of the promising areas, and extend the same to the continental
slope and deeper areas offshore. For this purpose, about 165,000 line-km of
seismic surveys and 219 exploratory wells (719,000 m) are proposed in the
1982/83-87/88 period.
Development
a.   Onshore
8.       Primary production for many of the fields in the Western Region is
declining, and sophisticated secondary and tertiary recovery techniques (water
flooding, polymer injection, thermal in-situ combustion, gas injection) will
be needed to maintain production. Contracts have been signed with the USSR to
assist in work-over operations, and with Nowasco of Canada to provide advanced
technology for well stimulation, acidization and fracturing. 226 development
wells are proposed during the 1980/81-1984/85 plan period (326,000 m). For
the period 1984/85-1989190, the investment program for the Western Region is



ANNEX 4.3
- 60 -                             Page 3 of 4
about US$1.6 billion, including the proposed Cambay Basin Petroleum Project
(US$954 million).
9.       In the eastern Region, an accelerated production program aiming at
producing 4.1 million tons by 1985/86 is underway. 273 wells (815,000 m) are
proposed for the 1982/83-87/88 period.
b.   Offshore
10.      The accelerated offshore production program includes the further
development of Bombay High and the development of new structures such as Ratna
(R-12), Heera (B-37/38), Bombay High East and Panna (North Bassein). In
addition, the South Bassein offshore gas field will be developed. CFP
(France) has been retained for the reservoirs studies and development of
Bombay High and neighboring fields. 341 development wells (789,000 m) are
proposed during the 1982/83-87/88 period.
Research and Development
11.      Three institutes for research and development function within ONGC;
the Institute of Petroleum Exploration (IPE) and the Institute of Drilling
Technology (IDT), both at Dehra Dun, ONGC's headquarters, and the Institute of
Reservoir Studies (IRS) at Ahmedabad. These institutes support ONGC's activi-
ties both onshore and offshore. IPE primarily frames the exploration stra-
tegy, reviews exploration programs, and prepares reserves estimates. IDT aims
at improving the drilling technology. To that effect, it develops tools,
carries out research in indigenous development of mud chemicals and cement
additives; it also supervises and monitors key exploratory wells projected for
deeper targets. IRS establishes drilling plans for various disco:ered fields,
monitors the behavior of producing reservoirs, carries out cconomic studies
and investigates enhanced recovery methods.
12.      ONGC is now considering establishing an OGfshore Technology Research
Institute in Bombay, which will be active in offshore oil exploration, devel-
opment, production and transportation, and upgrades ONGC's know-how in off-
shore technology, deep water techniques, etc.

CAMBAY BASIN PETROLEUM PROJECT
ONGC Operations in the Cambay Basin
Drilling
Drilling activity in the Western Region consists mainly of develop-
ment wells of shallow depth. ONGC Western Region (WR) drills 60 to 70 wells
per year of which 6 or 7 are exploration wells and the remaining development
wells. ONGC-WR owns and operates 16 land drilling rigs. Fourteen of these
are of Russian build and design, one is of Romanian build and design and one
is Indian built of US design. Most of the Russian rigs are very old, ranging
from 15 to 23 years, and of a very low efficiency, taking at least twice as
long to drill a well compared to a new modern rig. ONGC's yearly average
drilling performance is of a low level - 5 to 6 wells of 1,600-meter depth
per rig in development and 1 :o 2 wells of 3,000-meters depth per rig in
exploration.
The Russian rigs, as well as the Romanian one which was delivered in
1978, are diesel mechanic and of inadequate design. Their mechanical system
offers little flexibility and availability, resulting in continuously dis-
rupted operations. Mud processing is also of poor design. The mud solids
control equipment is virtually nonexistent and mud treatment equipment com-
pletely ineffective. ONGC's operating efficiency is further hampered by the
absence of infrastucture and logistical support. All this leads to a low
drilling penetration rate, poor cement job and finally to a well of poor
quality, which may need to be worked over sooner than its normal producing
life.
Drilling Services
All specialized well drilling services are performed by ONGC. These
services include mud engineering, mud logg, Y, electric logging, cementing,
formation drill stem testing and production testing with all other related
operations. The equipments used for these services are very old and com-
pletely worn out, except for electric logging for which 2 US made units have
just been received and will be operating shortly.
Mud Engineering
The mud system normally used by ONGC-WR is of a fresh water bentonite
lignosulfonate type for which most of the products and chemicals are produced
locally. No rig mud laboratories are available and the field mud test kits
are incomplete. As observed in the field, most of the time mud engineers use
inadequate or incomplete equipment for measuring mud properties. This may
explain why, although the mud is of a water base type, its properties are not
properly controlled. As observed, solidb content is very high and the spe-
cific gravity often much higher than actually needed. This leads to subse-
quent problems such as a low drilling penetration rate, poor cement job and
formation damage. Formation damage appears to be very critical in the Cambay
gas field.

Page 2 of 3
Mud Logging
ONGC's rigs in the Western Region, including those used in explora-
tion, are not equipped with mud logging units. Rig personnel use an old-
fashioned device for drilling control and geological monitoring. Modern mud
logging equipment would assist rig personnel in continuously and automatically
monitoring various bottom-hole parameters during drilling. As a result,
geological surveillance would be more accurate and easier. On the other hand,
without mud logging units, drilling data acquisition is minimal and sometimes
unreliable.
Electric Logging
ONGC's well logging equipment in the Western Region is Russian-made
and old. The system is composed of two trucks, one containing the electric
wireline winch and associated gears and the other logging instruments and
controls. Logging tools and instruments in these units are reported to be of
poor accuracy and useless when the hole temperature exceeds 1200F, which
happens quite often in the Western Region. Except for a few basic tools, most
required tools are lacking. These existing units can be used as tools for
correlation purposes but are not effective guides in locating pay zones.
However, ONGC is well aware of the limitation of its equipment and has just
received two US-made units which will be in operation shortly with technical
assistance from the supplier. These two technically advanced units will cover
most of the exploration needs and will help in drilling the complicated devel-
opment wells.
Cementing
Most of the cement jobs are not successful. In addition to the use
of inadequate cementing equipment, cementing operations are done with Portland
construction cement which is well known for its poor results when used in oil
or gas wells. As opposed to electric logging where ONGC is now introducing
up-to-date equipment, cementing services are still performed with substandard
units of very low performance. These units are Romanian and Russian made, old
and worn out. Each unit is equipped with a single pump, mounted on a truck.
Bulk cement tanks are carried out on trucks of 15 to 20 ton capacity. The
system cannot perform continuous cement slurry mixing and pumping, which is
essential to maintaining proper slurry parameters.
Formation Testing
No formation drill stem testing (DST) is carried out while drilling
due to lack of the necessary equipment. For this reason, even exploratory
wells are not adequately tested while drilling.  The way the wells are evalu-
ated is actually rather surprising:  in exploration, after the well has been
drilled and if electric logs indicate an interesting zone, the hole is cased
and perforated.  A compressor is then used to inject air through the annulus
between the tubing and the casing, thus reducing the hydrostatic pressure on
the reservoir.  The pressure differential so created causes an influx of oil
or gas from the reservoir into the well. In this manner, no bottom hole data
can be acquired. In addition to the high risk of total casing collapse and
blow out, the procedure may fail to stimulate petroleum flow and it should be
of no surprise if critical errors are made on the final judgement regarding



- 64 -                            ANNEX 4.4
Page 3 of 3
the absence of petroleum. This method is also regularly applied in develop-
ment wells for production testing.
Work-Over
To date there are more than 345 development wells that need to be
worked over, which affects oil production susbstantially. These wells are
estimated to have a production potential of 3,000 to 4,000 tons of oil per
year. In addition to the present work-over backlog, one can assume that the
number of wells in need of work-over will increase by 140 to 150 each year.
In comparison the present work-over capacity of ONGC Western Region is about
120 wells per year.
Work-Over Rigs
ONGC Western Region owns and operates 23 work-over rigs. In addi-
tion, two truck-mounted work-over rigs have been contracted from the USSR.
Most of ONGC's rigs are very old (15 to 17 years) and have reached the end of
their useful life. Their average performance, including the two under con-
tract with the USSR, is of a very low level. Work-over activity is further
hampered by the absence of infrastructure and logistical support. Well
repairs that seem too complicated (fishing, casing and bottom hole equipment
deterioration) are not carried out due to limitations to the rigs' capability
and condition. About 140 wells of such complicated work-over jobs have been
left behind. The authorities of ONGC-Western Region are aware of the need to
acquire new equipment. Four new US-made self-propelled work-over rigs are
expected to arrive in the Cambay Basin early this year.
Organization
ONGC Western Region appears to have a well-conceived organizational
structure. -A regional management committee based in Baroda sets operational
plans, elaborates programs and coordinates field requirements. It is organ-
ized on a functional basis with the following groups: production, geology,
drilling, maintenance, finance, administration and stores, and supply.
Project managers, based in the fields (e.g., Anklewsvar, Ahmebabad, Cambay),
supervise the implementation of programs. The field management team is said
to have a high level of delegation of authority over operations. Sometimes,
however, a communication gap appears to exist between the field team and
higher level authority.
Personnel
Operational personnel involved in discussions with Bank staff were
very knowledgeable. In fields visited by the Bank mission the overall working
atmosphere was good, despite mechanical problems and the inadequacy of the
equipment. Field personnel seem well organized and appear to perform accord-
ing to normal oil field practice. Most of the engineers occupying key opera-
tional positions were apparently well aware of ONGC Western Region operating
problems.

INDIA
CAMBAY BASIN PETROLEUM PROJECT
Geology of the Cambay Basin and Hydrocarbon Resource Potential
A.       General Geology
1.       The Cambay Basin came into existence at the close of the Mesozoic
period with development of tensional down faulting along iLS margins accom-
panied by large scale volcanic activity. Later, TerLiary sands and shales,
principally of Paleocene and Eocene ages, filled the basin. The depositional
environment of these Tertiary sediments range from shallow marine aL the base
becoming deeper marine to continental as basin fill progressed. The southern
half of the basin was cut by east-northeast and west-southwest trending
lateral faulLs activated primarily during and since the Miocene epoch. Struc-
tures in the Cambay Basin are of two basic types: (i) horst and graben ten-
sional fault blocks (including tilted marginal fault blocks at the edge of the
basin) unaffecLed by lateral movements in Lhe northern portion of the basin
and (ii) compressional folds associated with lateral movements in the southern
portion of the basin.
2.       The marine Cambay Black Shale of Paleocene-Eocene age, is considered
as the main source rock for the hydrocarbons encountered in the Cambay
Basin. Secondary source rocks are the shallow marine to fresh-water inLer-
bedded shales of the Eocene deltaic intervals (Kalol Formation and equiva-
lents). In addition, even the relatively low organic content Miocene shales
of southern Cambay Basin are now considered to be the source rocks for Lhe
important gas deposits now being established in the offshore of the Cambay
Basin.
3.       Reservoir rocks in the Cambay Basin are primarily deltaic sandstones
of Middle Eocene age, deposited by two distinct advancing delta fronts: (i)
the southern Narmada delta and its distributaries which enter from the east-
northeast adjacent to the present course of the Narmada River and (ii) in the
norLh, Lhe Sabarmati delta, which enters from the north-northeast. To the
north, the Narmada delta sands appear to extend as far as the Mahsagar
River. Rowever, the southern limit of the sands is not well known due to the
lack of adequate number of wells drilled into Lhe subsurface so far. The
northern Sabarmati delta sands extend as far south as Ahmedabad. Lenticular,
shaly pre-delta sandstones are found at the base of the Tertiary within the
marine Cambay Shale. Sandstone reservoirs of Mio-oligocene and younger
geologic age, associated with a possible delta system have been found at the
southern end of the basin and inLo the Bombay offshore area. Likewise, minor
pay has been penetrated in sideratic marls, fractured shales and coal beds in
the non-marine portion of the northern delta.
4.       The base of Lhe Tertiary is marked by a thick basalt (Deccan Trap) of
varying thickness, currently interpreted to be in excess of 1000 meters. The
existence of pre-Trappean Mesozoic sediments in the subsurface of the Cambay
Basin is uncertain. Scattered and incomplete surface exposures along the
eastern margins of the basin indicate the presence of pre-Tertiary con-
tinental-laccustrine sands and shales (clasLics) as well as shallow water



- 66 -                               ANNEX 5.1
Page 2 of 2
marine limestones. Attempts have been made to project hydrocarbon source and
reservoir rocks into the basin beneath Lhe Deccan Trap basalts; however, Pre-
Trappean sediments could have been removed by erosion during possible post-
Mesozoic uplift and faulting phase of the basin. Although prenetrated in some
of the wells, the Deccan Trap has not been drilled through in order to
ascertain the existence of sediments beneath the basalts.
B.       Hydrocarbon Reserves Potential
5.       Large in-place reserves remain Lo be discovered in the Cambay
Basin. A joint ONGC/Soviet study group in 1978/1979 concluded that the in-
place hydrocarbon reserves in the basin could be as large as 850 million toe
of which about 500 million toe has been discovered so far. Data at hand
supports that these estimated reserves are significant and can be economically
exploited from a wide range of geologic prospects onshore, and more signifi-
cantly, offshore under the Gulf of Cambay. The remaining prospecLs onshore
involve deep potential hydrocarbon zones beneath currently producing fields as
well as in isolated wells with shows not adequately tested to rank as discov-
eries. Additional prospective features, both shallow and deep, exist onshore
in the basin's central block where, due to ONGC's preconceived concepts
regarding the areas low potential and poor reservoir sand development, have
experienced only limited exploratory drilling. The basin's greatest poten-
tial, however, lies offshore along the tidal/transition zone and beneath the
shallow waters of the Cambay Gulf. A series of structures associated with
faulting are seen at the seaward extension of the basin at Hazira and Dahej,
projecting outward to North Tapti, Central Tapti and South Tapti. All but
North Tapti have been drilled and proved to be hydrocarbon bearing. The South
and Cental Tapti features, on the basis of one field discovery each, are
tentatively credited with 40 million tons of condensate and 62 billion cubic
meters of gas. The Hazira and Dahej gas/condensate discoveries, while not
assigned reserves at this time, are expected to extend into the offshore and
could be of significant magnitude.

CAMBAY BASIN PETROLEUM PROJECT
Project Components
1.       The proposed project has four major components with the following
specific objectives: (i) exploration - to pursue the search for petroleum by
drilling to deeper untested stratigraphic zones, and to acquire seismic data
and hence identify potential hydrocarbon prospects in the unexplored shallow
waters and shoal areas of the Gulf of Cambay; (ii) development and production
- to accelerate the development of undeveloped and underdeveloped oil fields
and improve well maintenance, thereby increasing oil production in the basin 3
by close to 2 million tons per year and gas production by about 142 million m
per year (0.12 million toe per year) within six years; (iii) enhanced oil
recovery pilot tests -- to increase recoverable reserves of the heavy oil
fields by determining the most appropriate enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method
through field pilot schemes; and (iv) technical training and assistance - to
improve the drilling and production efficiency in the basin through training
programs, hiring of technical consultants and contractors, as well as by
introducing new and modern equipment as an integral part of project
implementation.
A.       Exploration Component
2.       The exploration component has two sub-components, a seismic survey
and deep exploration drilling.
1. Seismic Survey
3.       Approximately 20X of the Cambay Basin is in the Cambay Gulf and
covered by current swept shallow waters, tidal mud flats and shoals. This
area requires the application of high resolution and modern seismic methods.
To date, this highly prospective area has been neglected for lack of
specialized geophysical techniques and equipment needed to acquire data in
this difficult environment. Only one well has been drilled in the mud flats
area, the Aliabet No. 1, which tested oil in the Miocene. The seismic survey
included in the project will: (i) help outline the seaward extent of the Dahej
structure, a major Eocene gas field discovered in 1979 and currently under
appraisal; (ii) delineate possible fault controlled structures (i.e.,
drillable prospects) in the Gulf similar to Ankleshvar field; and (iii) help
determine the western Eocene sand limits of the Narbada prograding delta.
This seismic survey is designed to acquire 1,750 line kilometers of data: 300
line kilometers in shallow waters of the Gulf of Cambay and 1,450 line
kilometers using "teleseis" technique over the tidal and shoal areas.
FurtrhLrmore, depending upon the successful outcome of the offshore North Tapi
No. 1 wildcat, located in the Gulf of Cambay about 75 kilometers southwest of
Ankleshvar field, ONGC may propose in late 1984, to add another 800 line
kilometers of seismic survey under the project. This would be acceptable.
The additional seismic survey would be south of the area covered by the 1,750
kilometer program and restricted to the eastern shoreline and saltwater
marsh/swamp areas of the Gulf. It is expected that the "teleseis" method of
acquisition would also be used for this extension. The prime objectives of



- 68 -                             AEX
Page 2 of 12
this additional coverage would be to: (i) secure nearshore subsurface data to
resolve the size and prospectiveness on the Hazira Well No. 1 Miocene gas
discovery of 1969; (ii) determine the southern sand limits of the Eocene
Ankleshvar sands of the Narbada delta and possibly determine the hydrocarbon
source for the thick deltaic Miocene sands recently discovered to be
petroleum-bearing on the offshore Tapti structures; and (iii) search for fault
controlled structures and traps in the Gulf, which are expected to parallel
the northeast-southwest trend as currently mapped in the Ankleshvar, Hazira
and offshore Tapti areas.
4.       The seismic survey (data acquisition and processing) will be
undertaken by an international contractor. However, in the past two years,
the Ministry of Defense has imposed more strict requirements and clearance
procedures for the processing of seismic data by outside contractors. On the
other hand, ONGC's existing computer facility has a backlog of about 4 to 5
years of seismic data for processing and could not be expected to process the
data to be collected under the project in a timely or satisfactory manner. A
new computer is on order but is not expected to be operational for another two
years. The mission was assured by ONGC that the necessary clearances will be
sought from the Ministry of Defense to process the data by contract. However,
in case this request is denied by the Government, ONGC, in consultation with
the Bank, will make satisfactory arrangements for processing the data
expeditiously within India. The options available are:
(i)    using a foreign contractor with software compatible with ONGC's
computer system to process the data in India;
(ii)    allowing the contractor selected through ICB to process the
data in India on its own computer; and
(iii)    ONGC processing the data on a priority basis, in its computer
center if the quality of the processing s found to be
comparable.
2. Exploratory Drilling
5.       Most identifiable subsurface/seismic features in the basin have been
drilled at least through the main Middle Eocene pay zones (i.e., down to about
3,000 meters). Future production increases from the onshore basin, other than
that realized from the infill drilling of undeveloped or underdeveloped fields
and proposed EOR schemes, must be derived from yet to-be-tested deep (i.e.,
4,000 to 5,000 meters) stratigraphic zones and reservoirs drapped over
basement highs. The four stratigraphic (parametric) exploration wells
proposed by ONGC represent the next logical phase in the exploration and
exploitation of the basin. These four wells have been designed to primarily
penetrate the maximum stratigraphic section to the economic basement (Deccan
Trap), evaluate deep Lower Eocene lenticular sandstones and formulate
depositional concepts for the encased reservoirs within the Cambay shale.
Furthermore, these wells have been site-selected, where possible, to encounter
potentially productive shallower (i.e. 3,000 to 4,000 meters) zones pinching
out up-dip against structure or trapped against sealing faults which occur
frequently in the basin. Successful completion of these wells will provide
ONGC with additional information on the new basinal hydrocarbon trends and pay
targets to potentially supplant the expected depletion of existing fields.

The four locations proposed for drilling are : (i) Bharkodra, (ii) Jambusar-P,
(iii) West Kalol and (iv) South Warosan (IBRD Map No. 17602)
6.       The mission informed ONGC that additional seismic information and
geological analyses should be performed for two of the proposed four wells to
optimize the spudding location. ONGC agreed to do these. During the pre-
appraisal mission, the Bank staff also suggested, and ONGC agreed, that a
detailed drilling program and a preliminary completion program approved by the
Bank would be prepared before each well is spudded. At present, only a highly
summarized one-page prognosis, the General Technical Order (GTO), is prepdred
which is not satisfactory. ONGC confirmed that before each exploration well
is drilled, Bank approval will be obtained by ONGC for the specific
location. Furthermore, a detailed drilling program as well as preliminary
completion program satisfactory to the Bank will be prepared.
B.       Dev3lopment and Production Component
7.       The development and production component of the project consists of
four sub-components: (i) the final phase or completion of the development
schemes of several light oil fields namely Kalol, North Kadi, South Kadi,
Sobhasan and Nawagam; (ii) the initial (primary) development of the heavy oil
fields namely, North Santhal, Balol and Lanwa; (iii) the rehabilitation of the
Cambay gas field, the largest non-associated gas field in the basin; and (iv)
improvement of well maintenance (workover) operations to eliminate the
substantial backlog of production wells needing repairs, as well as to
increase the capacity and quality of well maintenance and workover to cope
with the increasing number and complexity of production wells as a result of
the proposed project.
1. Final Development of Light Oil Fields
8.       a.  Kalol Field.  The field is located at about 13 kms NE of the town
of Ahmedabad. It has an areal extent of 15 sq km. The field is highly
faulted and has about 10 pay zones identified as horizons 2 to 12, with
horizons 9 and 10 being the main oil producing zones. Horizons 5, 11 and 12
are poorly developed and not consistent in all the wells. Average porosity of
the field is about 20-22%, average permeability 20-150 milli darcies, oil
saturation about 65-70% and the average thickness of each producing zone is 4
to 5 meters. The field was discovered in 1960 and commercial production
started in 1964. The maximum oil production was attained in 1977178, peaking
at 358.527 tons (or 2.69 million barrels). The overall cummulative oil
production since 1964 is 3.54 million tons of oil with 1600 million m3 of
gas. This represents about 7% of initial oil in-place and 31% of estimated
recoverable reserves. The field is currentlyy producing about 850 tons of oil
per day (or 6300 BOPD) and 31.5 mmcf of gas per day, consisting of 600,000 m
of associated gas and 300,000 m3 of dry gas. The oil flows freely with an oil
viscosity of 1.4 centipoise at formation temperature.
9.       About 210 wells have been drilled in this field so far, consisting of
124 wells classified as oil wells, 31 as gas wells, 9 as water injection wells
for pressure maintenance, and 24 wells as abandoned wells (dry holes or tech-
nical problems). Of the 124 oil wells, 52 wells are still producing, 5 are



- 70 -
ANNEX 5.2

awaiting surface line connection, while 67 are closed-in and in need of work-
over. Of the 31 gas wells, 20 are producing, 7 closed-in due to excessive
water infiltration and 4 wells are awaiting surface line connection.
10.      The main objectives of the Kalol field final development program are
to: (i) increase the ultimate oil recovery factor from 21% based on existing
techniques and facilities to about 30% of the initial oil in-place; (ii)
increase the annual production rate which has declined from 358,527 tons in
1977/78 down to 184,296 tons in 1981/82, to about 640,000 tons per year by
1987/88; and (iii) to increase the associated and free gjs production from
about 65 million m3 per year at present to 248 million m per year by
1987/88. These are to be achieved through infill drilling, introduction of
artificial lift equipment (gas lift and sucker rod pumps) and expanding the
water injection schemes now in place. A total of 135 new wells, equipped with
artificial lift equipment, will be drilled under contract for this purpose.
Of these 135 wells, 108 will be drilled as oil producers and 27 will be
designed to be switched over to water injection wells after about 2 to 3 years
of production.  The peak incremental production due to the final development
plan is about 455,704 tons of oil and 183 million m3 of gas per year in
1988/89.
11.      b.  North Kadi Field  Located about 51 kms NW of Abmedabad, the field
was put on production in 1969. It has proven reserves (initial-oil-in-place)
of about 44 million tons. Total cummulative production so far is about 3
million tons of oil (20.6 million barrels). This total production represents
about 6% of the estimated initial oil-in-place or 19% of estimated recoverable
reservss. Current production rate is 1200 tons of oil per day (8640 BOPD) and
7500 m per day of gas (2 to 6 macf). The average porosity is about 28%,
permeability is about 1000 milli darcies and average thickness of producing
formation is 8 meters.
12.      There are 137 wells already drilled consisting of 105 oil wells, 3
gas wells, 9 pressure observation and disposal wells, 9 plugged or abandoned
wells, and 11 awaiting further production testing. Of the 105 oil wells, 32
wells are to be produced by an artificial lift system, including gas lift. An
additional 12 wells are currently being drilled. Optimization studies by ONGC
indicate that the production rate can be raised to 838,000 tons per year
through a total of 171 wells. Under the proposed project therefore, 59 wells
with artificial lift equipment are included for the final development of this
field.
13.      c.  South Kadi Field  The field is located about 40 km NW of
Ahmedabad and was discovered in the early 1960's. The average reservoir
thickness is 4 meters, average permeability and porosity is 20 to 50 milli
darcies and 39% respectively. Cummulative production before shut-in was
280,000 tons of oil (or 2.1 million barrels) equivalent to 17% of initial oil
in-place and 39% of recoverable reserves. The estimated oil reserves in the
field is about 1.6 million tons (or 12.16 million barrels). 6 wells have been
drilled so ffIr but these are currently shut-in due to high gas-oil ratio of
about 3000 m / barrel. This field is now proposed to be exploited by water
flood using an inverted 5-spot pattern with a total of 6 producers and 5
injectors. The maximum production envisaged is about 67,525 tons per year (of
which 40,500 tons is the incremental output due to the project) by 1986/87.
Additional recovery is expected to be about 25% of the initial oil in place.



- 71 -
ANNEX 5.2
Page 5 of 12
One injector well is already being drilled and the other 10 wells are included
in the proposed project. All production wells (6) will be equipped with
artificial lift equipment.
14.      d.  Sobhasan Field  The field is located close to the town of
Mehsana. It is the northernmost producing field in the Cambay Basin with
proven reserves (initial-oil-in place) of about 14 million tons. It was
discovered and put into production in 1969. There are 3 main producing zones
(S1, S2 and S3) with an average reservoir thickness of 12 meters. Average
reservoir porosity is estimated as 29% and average permeability at 500 milli
darcies. Total cunmulative is about 1 million tons of oil (7.3 million
barrels). This is equivalent to 7% of initial oil in place. Current daily
production is about 300 tons of oil (or 2190 BOPD). There are 58 wells
drilled in the Sobhasan field. 42 of these are oil wells, 2 are gas wells, 5
are observation wells, 4 are dry wells, while 5 wells are awaiting further
production testing. The final development program for the field consist of
drilling a total of 73 wells in order to raise the production rate to about
238,000 tons per year. The additional 31 wells will be drilled as part of the
proposed project.
15.      e.  Nawagam Field  The field is about 19 km south of Ahmedabad.  It
was discovered in 1962 and put on production in 1967.  To date, 2.8 million
tons (or 20.6 million barrels) of oil have been produced. This is about 10%
of the initial oil in-place (estimated at 27 million tons), and 44% of the
estimated recoverable oil reserves. The current average daily production is
about 300 tons of oil per day (or 2200 BOPD). Oil saturation is estimated at
70%, average porosity 20% and average permeability about 25 to 100 milli
darcies. ONGC estimates that an additional 17% of the original oil in-place
can be recovered if the field continues in its present state; however, with an
accelerated program of water injection, the recovery rate could be increased
to 26%. 79 wells have been drilled in the Nawagam field; 59 oil wells, 4
water injection wells, 10 abandoned wells and 6 awaiting further production
testing. Of the 59 wells, 32 are still producing (27 on artificial lift)
while 27 are shut-in due to mechanical problems and require workover.
However, based on recent reservoir stimulation studies done by ONGC, it is
envisaged that an increase in production by 200 tons per day could be achieved
for the next 6 years in the field, if 11 of the existing oil wells are
converted to water injection wells (2 wells have already been so converted).
In order to offset production losses and ensure more uniform drainage, an
additional thirteen in-fill wells with artificial lift will be required. Six
wells are currently being drilled and the other seven are included in the
proposed project.
2. Initial Development of Heavy Oil Fields.
16.          Description of Heavy Oil Field.  The "heavy oil" fields situated
in the northern part of the basin are confined to the elongated oil bearing
feature discovered along the eastern flank of the Mehsana horst. This
structure is stratigraphically controlled by an abrupt upward wedging out of
Middle Eocene sandstones against the rising flanks of the Mehsana horst
block. Although on the same trapping environment, these fields have been
functionally separated by increasing oil viscosities and corresponding drop in
gas/oil ratio (GOR). From south to north, the fields are Santhal, Balol and
Lanwa. Santhal at the south end of the field produces a 50 centipoise oil at



- 72 -                             ANNEX 5.2
Page 6 of 12
a reservoir temperature of 700C. Balol field in the middle, produces oil with
viscosity of 100 centipoise at 700C. The Lanwa field, at the northern end of
the elongated field reservoir, produces oil with a viscosity of 550 centipoise
at 700C. The average depth to the pay reservoir in all the fields is about
1000 meters.
17.      Heavy crude oils are generally similiar in origin to conventional
crudes, but they are the result of a different evolution. With respect to the
Santhal, Balol and Lanwa fields, the difference in the viscosities can be
explained by:
(i)    Loss of light ends as a result of dismigration either upwards or
laterally, or due to evaporation through poor seals. Filtra-
tion, physical segregation and leeching with meteoric water is
also a possibility; and
(ii)    Biodegration as a result of a continuous leeching process by the
ingress of meteoric waters. The leeching prvcess iadaecs bac-
terial attack and changes the chemical composition of the oil
which is reflected in a lower wax content heavier crude.
18.      a.  Santhal Field  This field is located five miles (8 kilometers)
southwest of the town of Mehsana. It is the southernmost field discovered on
the east flank of the Mehsana horst block. The producing Santhal feature is
contiguous to the North Kadi field, separated from it to the north by a slight
structural reentrant. The producing formation in the Santhal field is a
clean, unconsolidated sandstone of Middle Eocene age, the Chatral member of
the Kadi Formation. The sand development shows progressive thinning northward
from Santhal field, becoming restricted to increasingly shallower levels in
the subsurface. Porosities in the field range between 30% to 32%, and
permeabilities are 1.5 to 2 darcy.
19.      The Santhal field has proven oil reserves (initial oil in place) of
about 40 million tons of which about 65% is located in the southern portion of
the field. The field was put oa production in 1974 but only the southern
portion of this field has so far been developed by ONGC. The field has an
active water drive. So far 41 wells are producing with a combined production
of about 239,000 tons of oil per year. Cumulative production as of March
1983, was about 0.4 million tons or about 1% of the initial oil in place.  The
development scheme for the field envisages a total of 125 wells, 76 in the
southern section and 44 in the northern section. ONGC is now expected to
complete the development of the southern section by 1984/85. The initial
development of the northern section (44 wells) is included in the proposed
project and is expected to provide a peak incremental production of about
241,000 tons per year oy 1988/89. The wells will be equipped with artificial
lift equipment. Primary recovery in the North Santhal field is expected to be
about 10-12% of the initial oil in place.
20.      b.  Ba&ol Field  The Balol field has estimated reserves (proved and
probable) of about 25 million tons of oil. Gravity of the crude is 130 API and
viscosity is about 100 centipoise at 700C. This field is not yet on
production. To date, 15 exploration wells have been drilled, of which 5 were
abandoned, 6 were oil-bearing and 4 need additional testing and are expected
to be oil-bearing. The primary development plan envisaged under the proposed



- 73 -
ANNEX 5.2
Page 7 of 12
project involves a total of about 109 wells, all equipped with artificial lift
equipment. Six wells are to be drilled in 1984/85 to obtain good core samples
to improve reservoir data analysis, further delineate the field, test the well
and completion design, and obtain some production history. The main drilling
program will commence in 1986/87. This schedule would also permit the
infrastructure and surface facilities to be installed before implementation of
the development drilling program. Balol and Lanwa (and also North Santhal)
are the fields selected for thermal enhanced oil recovery (EOR) pilot methods
and one of the purposes of the primary development of the fields is to
condition the reservoirs (i.e., reduce pressures, etc.) for eventual
application of EOR techniques. Primary recovery in the Balol field is
expected to be about 9% of the initial oil in place. EOR (i.e., in-situ
combustion) is expected to improve the recovery to about 40% to 50%. For the
primary development, the wells will be designed for thermal service and well
spacing will take into account the eventual EOR well spacing.
21.      c.  Lar.wa Field  The Lanwa field is located at the northern end of
the Santhal-Balol-Lanwa feature, and has esti- .ed oil reserves (proved and
probable) of about 17 million tons (initial oil in place).   Six exploration
wells have so far been drilled, of which two were abandoned, two wells
produced oil (with sucker rod and pumps and gravel pack) and two remain to be
tested but are expected to produce oil. Because the casing design and sucker
rod pump used in the two producing wells were too small for the type of oil
.ad depth involved, the pumps failed and production from these wells ceased
after about six weeks. The wells produced about 9 tons of oil per day during
the test period. Based on the oil and reservoir characteristics, as well as
the tests described ab)ove, a properly designed well and pumping system should
produce oil from this field at economic rates. Under the project, about 134
wells equipped with artificial lift equipment are to be drilled for the
primary field development. Twelve of these wells will be drilled during
1984/85 and 1985/86 to better delineate the field and improve reserve
estimates and other field data. The other 122 wells will be drilled during
1987/88-1989/90 to smooth out the drilling program during the implementation
period. Primary recovery is expected to be only about 5% of the initial oil
in place. But, as in the case of Balol, Lanwa is well suited for thermal EOR
recovery (i.e., in-situ combustion) and about 45% of the initial oil in place
is expected to be recovered with this EOR technique. Again, primary
development will take into account the field development pattern (well design
and spacing) for the eventual EOR project.
3. Cambay Gas Field Rehabilitation
22.      The Cambay gas field was the first petroleum field discovered in the
Cambay Basin in the late 1950's. It is geologically sited on the southern
sandstones and shales above an eocene sequence. The deepest well in the field
was drilled to 3333m, penetrating about lOOUm of Paleocene sands and
conglomerates. The reservoir has two main hydrocarbon zones--an upper zone
(1,600 m.) containing gas and a lower zone (2,000 m.) containing oil.  The g s
zone has been produced since the early 1960's, but about half (1.5 billion m )
of recoverable reserves still remain to be extracted. A total of 55 gas wells
have been drilled but about 20 have been abandoned due to water encroach-
ment. Another 10 will be similarly abandoned within about one year and the
remainder will probably also have to be abandoned within five to seven
years. Because the wells are old and poorly cemented they cannot be worked



- 74 -
ANNEX 5.2
Page 8 of 12
over. Gas production has been declining and is now about 70,000 m3/day and
could fall further to about one-half this rate within a few years. The field
can be rehabilitated, however, and after discussion with Bank staff, ONGC
suggested drilling initially, about 4 oil wells to: (a) test various well
stimulation techniques to produce the oil; and (b) better estimate the oil
reserves and recovery that could be expected.
23.      The Cambay field sub-component will therefore consist of: (i) rehab-
ilitation of the field by drilling about 10 new gas production wells using
advanced drilling techniques to take into account the depressed pressures
(below hydrostatic) in the gas zones; and (ii) evaluation and testing of the
various stimulation methods to commercially produce the apparently tight oil
formation in the lower pay zone for which about 4 wells will be needed.  With
the new gas wells, production is expected to increase to about 140,000 m3/day.
C.       Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) Component
24.      Three EOR pilot schemes are included in the proposed project: two
thermal EOR pilots in the Lanwa heavy oil field and a polymer chemical flood
pilot in the Jhalora light oil field. Bank consultants have re-ommended these
among several proposed by ONGC.
25.      a.  In-situ Combustion Pilot at Lanwa Field  The Lanwa field has the
most viscous heavy oil and will be the first field to require a commercial EOR
scheme within about 4 to 6 years after primary development. A thermal EOR
technique is expected to increase oil recovery to about 45% of the initial oil
in place from only about 5% achieved through primary production. The first
thermal EOR pilot will use the in-situ combustion technique. The second
pilot, which will be started about 18 to 24 months after the first, will use
either the steam flood method or the in-situ combustion method depending upon
the initial results of the first pilot. The Lanwa pilots, while specific to
that field, will also serve as a prototypes for the Balol and the Santhal
pilot in-situ combustion schemes which will follow one to three years later.
The in-situ combus'ion pilot is expected to last about four years.
26.      b.  Polymer Flood (Jhalora Field)  The polymer flood pilot at the
Jhalora field was recommended because of the adverse mobility ratio and
heterogeneous permeability profile of the reservoir. The primary recovery of
the Jhalora field is expected to be around 16% with cumulative production from
1977 up to the present already about 6% of the initial oil in place (26.4
million tons). However, oil production has begun to decline as the water cut
increased from 20% two years ago to 30% at present. An EOR scheme is
therefore needed within a few years to reverse the decline in production and
increase the recovery factor. The Jhalora polymer pilot is expected to last
about four years and recover an additional 15X to 25% of the initial-oil-in-
place. It will also serve as a prototype for the other light oil fields.
27.      c.  Ankleshvar Field  The Ankleshvar oil field is the largest
petroleum field in the Cambay Basin. It was discovered in 1960 and covers an
area of about 25 km2 with an estimated 113 million tons of initial-oil-in-
place (IOIP). It produces a high quality oil (47 API) from eleven sandstone
pays (S1 to Si1) of middle to upper Eocene age at an average depth of about
1140 meters. The currert oil production is about 1.5 million tons per year,
down from the peak of 3 million tons achieved in 1968. About two thirds of



- 75 -                       ANNEX 5.2
Page 9 of 12
the production comes from three zones (S2, S3 and S4). Cummulative production
by August 31, 1983 was about 50.4 million tons and the remaining recoverable
reserves is about 9.8 million tons (equivalent to 6.5 years of production).
The expected ultimate recovery factor is high (53X of IOIP) primarily due to
the good characteristics of the producing oil sands which make the oil and
water mobility about equal in the reservoir.
28.      The reservoir has a natural water drive and was placed on wdter
injection (into the water table) for pressure maintenance in 1963 shortly
after production started. Despite the advanced stage of water injection, the
average producing water cut is still only 40%.
29.      The status of the wells in the field are as follows:
Number
Production Wells                                         196
Of which:  Producing Oil         a       90

a/ About 35 of these wells will be placed on artificial lift (gas lift,
sucker rod pumps, or Reda pumps).
30.      The Ankleshvar field is close to depletion having produced almost 84Z
of its recoverable reserves on the basis of existing productin technolo-
gies. To evaluate the potential of increasing the ultimate recoverable
reserves (53% IOIP at present), ONGC is studying advanced EOR techniques
(e.g., micellar/polymer flood) through laboratory experiments. These studies
will be supported by the EOR consultants to be provided under the project.
D.       Technical Assistance and Training Component
31.       ONGC's field operations in the Cambay Basin suffer from many serious
deficiencies and problems. One of the main objectives of the proposed project
is to improve ONGC's oil field operations through training, use of consultants
and contractors, and introduction of new technology, equipment and
materials. Each one of these is described briefly below.
32.      While ONGC has extensive training facilities and programs for
managerial and higher level technical staff, it does not have a meaningful
training program for field level employees. In the past, oil field workers
learn through informal on-the-job apprenticeship. Last year, ONGC began a
modest oil field worker training facility near Ahmedabad in the Cambay
Basin. The program consisted of a si- week introductory course plus on-the-
job training. The facility has very limited training aids. ONGC, however,
plans to build four or five large training centers around the country. A
training consultant with the Bank preappraisal mission reviewed ONGC's



- 76 -                           ANNEX 5.2
Page 10 of 12
existing and proposed training facilities and program. The consultant
recommended a more modest training center for the Cambay Basin, but with a
more comprehensive training curriculum. In addition, a major effort will be
made to prepare and develop the necessary training materials and train the
instructors. This will recuire the h:ring of a training consultant to
initially help ONGC organize the planning and implementation of this training
program. Training aids will include simulators, laboratory equipment, models
and prototypes, closed circuit TV system, etc. The training program will
cover basic and advanced courses in all facets of oil field operations (e.g.,
drilling, production, cementing, various types of logging, pipelines, well
stimulation, and instrumentation).
33.      In addition to the training programs for field level employees
included under the project, technical assistance will be provided by an
expatriate consultant firm to assist in implementing the project and improving
ONGC's field operations. Technical assistance will cover the application and
evaluation of EOR methods (in-situ combustion and chemical flooding), and as
required, also engineering, drilling practices, mud engineering, workover
techniques and formation testing. Experienced internm-tional contractors in
drilling and technical well services (e.g. cementing, logging, production
testing) will be utilized for a substantial portion of the project in areas
where ONGC lacks sufricient expertise and capacity in order to implement the
project within a reasonable period. These service contracts will have
provisions for practical training of ONGC personnel.
E.       Equipment for ONGC Drilling Operations
a. Technical Well Services Equipment
34.      Some of the drilling procedures currently being practiced in the
Cambay Basin are suboptimal due to ONGC's use of inefficient and outdated
rigs. Also, downhole penetration rates are often decreased by frequent
drilling difficulties (i.e. high bottomhole temperatures, hole enlargements
caused by formation caving and sloughing, and low formation pressure zones).
In spite of many trials with water-base muds, ONGC Western Region has not been
able to select a drilling fluid compatible with the high temperature and low
pressure zones it encounters. Oil-base muds cannot be tested at the drill-
site due to the poor design of the mud circulating system on ONGC's outdated
rigs. All these factors have resulted in wells of poor quality and low
productive capacities. However, these problems can be traced to the lack of
adequate drilling equipment and materials.
35.      The new equipment included in the proposed project is essential
towards modernizing and improving the efficiency of ONGC's onshore
uperations. It is also required for ONGC to effectively undertake its portion
of the project's drilling program within a reasonable time. Equipment to be
acquired will be for exploration. development and production as follows:
a. coring equipment;
b. three open hole electric logging units;
c. two production logging units;
d. fourteen production wire-line units;
e. seven mud-logging units;
f. five units (each 3 MW) of mobile gas turbine power generators;
g. field radio communications;
h. ten workover rigs; and
i. seven mobile drilling rigs.

36.      CNGC presently does not have any rig-site equipment to continuously,
monitor downhole conditions and the parameters of drill'ng mud components and
hydrocarbons in the drilling fluid system. Also, ONGC rigs presently lack
formation coring tools to cut and retrieve the typically unconsolidated and
loose sands which predominate in many Cambay Basin fields. State-of-the art
electric logging units in the basin are limited in number and often important
exploratory wells are inadequately evaluated. Reliable and accurate
subsurface patameters are also critical in determining reservoir
characteristics and essential in the design and implementation of any
secondary or enhanced oil recovery project. As part of the project, ONGC will
purchase mudlogging units, downhole coring equipment, electric logging trucks
and cable tools, production logging units and wire-line service units. This
ancillary equipment package will either provide additional units or
replacement units to cover existing shortfalls and deficiencies in field
facilities.
37.      Of the 14 drilling rigs operating in the Cambay Basin at present, 12
are obsolete and should have been replaced a long time ago. As part of the
project, 7 heavy duty mobile drilling rigs will be purchased to drill ONGC's
portion of the development wells included in the project. The new rigs will
replace the old rigs and should be similar to the contracted rigs; they
represent a new technology for ONGC. The rigs will subsequently be used for
infill drilling in the commercial-scale EOR projects in the heavy and the
light oil fields that will follow the pilot schemes in about 5 co 7 years.
They will also be used for workover of the deeper wells (2,000- 2,500 m) in
the bdsin (e.g., Kalol). The rigs will therefore be productively used in the
project area for at least the next 10 years.
38.      During the preparation and preappraisal missions, Bank staff
recommended that ONGC change its casing policy for wells to be drilled under
the project-(and ONGC's onshore operations, in general) with respect to the
use of a 5 1/4" production casing. Instead, a 7" production casing should be
used. ONGC agreed to this change during the appraisal mission. In addition,
ONGC also agreed that for the project only API certified or labeled oil field
cement be used. During negotiations, agreement was reached with ONGC that at
least 386 wells will be designed with 7" production casings and only API
certified cement or equivalent will be used below 500 meters depth.
39.      Some components of the project, particularly the extensive use of
artificial lift equipment, will increase the electrical power requirements in
ONGC's Cambay Lasin operations tremendously. Unfortunately, there is a
shortage of power (about 10% for at least over the next several years) in the
State of Gujarat. At present ONGC does not generate any power of its own and
relies exclusively on the State grid. This is unusual for an oilfield
operation, particularly one such as the Cambay Basin with its widely
distributed oil fields located in an area suffering from power shortage and in
which ONGC has substantial gas production as well as several isolated oil
fields with small quantities of associated gas (which is being flared). ONGC
has therefore included in the proposed project 5 units of mobile gas turbine
power generators (each 3 IW). These units will be initially installed in
Kalol (3) and in Anklesvar (2), the two major oil fields in the basin. The
units to be installed in Kalol will be a part of a cogeneration plant to
generate power and steam by recovering the turbines' exhaust heat.

40.      One of ONGC's more obvious deficiencies in field operations is the
lack of modern radio communications. The introduction of new base radio
stations at selected office support and supply depots in addition to numerous
side band mobile units in vehicles and field locations is proposed. This
radio communication network will help alleviate the huge amounts of down-time
spent waiting for supplies or maintainence at rig sites and coordinate the
movement of materials and personnel throughout the field.
41.      b.   Improvement of Field Workover Operations  Each year, about 130
to 150 wells in the Cambay Basin need repairs (i.e., workover), which just
about matches ONGC's workover capacity. However, there is a backlog of about
345 wells which have been in need of workover for sometime now, the resulting
lost production being estimated at about 300,000 to 400,000 tons per year of
oil. The types of repair work required are as follows: servicing, testing and
downhole formation stimulation (120 wells); completion with artificial lift
equipment (75 wells); fishing (i.e., recovering broken tools, metal, etc.) and
casing repair (60 wells); cement squeeze for water shut off (35 wells); cement
squeeze for various water channeling behind the casing (30 wells) and gravel
pack and sand consolidation (25 wells).
42.      Well workover techniques used by ONGC, although acceptable by oil
industry standards, are not producing satisfactory results due mainly to the
age and obsolescence of the workover rigs which are 15 to 17 years old, worn
out and inefficient. Until recently, well-site scheduling time was inadequate
as most of the workover operations were carried out only during daylight
hours.  Thus, the average productivity of workover rigs was low, typically
about 6 to 6.5 wells per rig per year. ONGC is taking several steps to
improve this situation. Firstly, workover operations are now proceeding on a
24-hour basis. Secondly, a program has started to eliminate the backlog over
the next five years: A workover contract was signed last year for two Soviet
workover rigs (and crews) to handle 120 wells during three years (1983-85).
This contract work started slowly and is already behind schedule. ONGC will
handle the other 225 wells during the next five years (1983-87). To
accomplish this task and keep up with the additional and mc:e complex workover
jobs (about 110 per year) that will result from the 548 new development wells
to be drilled under the proposed project, ONGC will need to replace most of
its existing 23 workover rigs which are very old and, at the same time,
increase its fleet to about 30 to 35 workover rigs. Thirdly, ONGC has ordered
four self propelled, mechanical drive type of workover rigs and four modern
cementing units to be used with these rigs to be delivered in 1984. In
addition, two wireline logging units were acquired recently. With these new
facilities, workover operations are expected to improve substantially in 1984
but will still fall short of the field requirements. Therefore, under the
proposed project, additional equipment, namely 10 trailer or truck-mounted
workover rigs, two production logging units and 14 production wireline service
units will be purchased. Fourthly, ONGC will utilize whenever needed
technical assistance available under the proposed project to help plan and
undertake workover operations.

CAMBAY BASIN PETROLEIM PROJECT
Description of Exploration Wells
1.       The four stratigraphic (parametric) exporatory wells proposed by ON(C
are: (i) Bharkodra, (ii) Jambusar-P, (iii) West Kalol and (iv) South
Warosan. These exploratory tests have been selected to penetrate the maximum
stratigraphic section to the economic basement (Deccan Trap), evaluate deep
Lower Eocene lenticular sandstones and formulate depositional concepts for the
encased reservoirs within the Cambay shale. Further, where possible, the
drill-sites have been adjusted to provide shallower, secondary pay
objectives. Successful achievement of these objectives will present ONGC with
new trends and hydrocarbon targets within the Cambay Basin.
2.       Two of the four exploratory tests may require a change in location
and proposed total depth. These two are: (i) Jambusar and (ii) TWest Kalol.
The location and deep Mesozoic objectives of Jambusar-P, should be re-
evaluated on the basis of the results of the interpretation on 3 additional
seismic lines of 20 kilometers each to be acquired by ONGC. Two seismic lines
of about 20 kilometers each will be shot on the west flank of the KaLol field
to further tie the West Kalol exploratory test to the two previous deep wells:
K-236 and K-221. No further subsurface evaluation or seismic acquisition is
required on the Bharkodra and South Warosan locations. A summary of the four
exploratory wells is as follows:
Ci)    Bharkodra
Location:               In the southern sector of the Cambay Basin,
near the mouth of the Mahisagar River, about
(60 kilometers west of the town of Baroda.
Proposed Depth:         4000 meters (13,125 feet) or Deccan Trap
Geological Objective:  Primary objectives are Paleocene Olpad
trapwash deposits, encountered as gas
productive but not tested on the Devla No.
1. Secondary objectives are tower Eocene
Ankleshvar deltaic sandstones expected updio
of the Devla No. 1. The Devla No. 1 is
located about 13 kilometers south.
(ii)    Jambusar - P
Location:               In thej oLthern section of i e Cambay Basin,
about  5 kilometers south-s dthwest of the
town of Baroda.
Proposed Depth:         5500 meters (18,050 feet)
Geological Objective:  Primary objectives are to test the existence
and hydrocarbon potential of the Mesozoic
sediments beneath the Deccan Trap basalts.



- 80 -                          ANNEX 5.3
Page 2 of 2
Secondary objectives are to penetrate a lower
Eocene structure on the rim edge of the Broach
Syncline. The Lower and Middle Eocene
sandstones have been tested as productive in
the Dablea, Gajera and Matar areas.
Prognosis:             Final location and proposed depth to the
Mesozoic may be modified on the basis of the
three seismic lines of 20 kilometers each to
be recorded by ONGC.
(iii) West Kalol
Location:                In the northern section of the Cambay Basin,
on the western flank of Kalol field.
Proposed Depth:          4500 meters (14,765 feet) or Deccan Trap.
Geological Objective:    Primary objectives are to test the Cambay
Shale oil sands found productive but not
completed in the two deep Kalol field west
flank wells. Secondary objectives are Lower
Eocene sands expected to wedge-out along the
western flank of the structure.
Prognosis:               Location and proposed depth may be altered
subsequent to the two additional seismic lines
to be acquired by ONGC.
(iv) South Warosan
Location:                In the northern section of the Cambay Basin,
about 15 kilometers south of the town of
Mehsana.
Proposed Depth:          4000 meters (13,125 feet) or Deccan Trap.
Geological Objective:    Primary objectives are the Cambay Shale
lenticular sandstones found productive in the
Linch, South Kadi and Jotana areas. Secondary
objectives are deeper Cambay 'spill-over-
sands on a paleo shelf connecting the *  asan
and Jotana a(

ONGC Accounting Principles
Unit of Accounting
1.       The Unit of Accounting is an area covered by a license or lease.
Extension in the area covered by a separate license or lease is treated as an
independent area though contiguous. If a certain portion of a license or
lease is surrendered or declared as producing and the balance portion con-
tinues under exploration, related costs are segregated and amortized or
depleted.
Exploration
2.       Geological and geophysical survey costs are charged in each year of
account.
3.       All exploratory drilling costs are initially accumulated and each
year's expenditure is amortized equally over 15 years. If and when an area is
determined to be unsuccessful and the license is surrendered, the related
balance costs shown on the balance sheet (net of accumulated amortization) is
expended against income in three equal annual installments. Any further
adjustments in the cost due to accruals, etc., are reckoned equally in the
balance period after the surrender of the area. In case an area is declared
successful, the balance costs are transferred to the Producing Property
Account.
Oil and Gas Producing Properties
4.       Oil and Gas Producing Properties include exploratory drilling costs
and costs incurred in development. Since the Unit of Accounting is an area
covered by a license or lease, all drilling costs incurred in that area are
transferred from exploration to Producing Property Account, net of amorti-
zation already charged under exploration. Producing properties are created
when regular production starts from the field regardless of the level of
production. Once producing properties are created the depletion is charged
equally over 10 years. Subsequent development costs are depleted in such a
manner that total costs are charged against income in the balance period of 10
years from the date of commencement of regular Droduction. Development costs
after 10 years are charged against income in the year of expenditure.
Research and Development
5.       Research and Development costs other than acquisition of capital
assets are charged against income as incurred.
Depreciation
6.       Plant, equipment and other capital items are stated at cost and
depreciated using a diminishing balance method at the rates set forth in the



- 88 -                              Annex 6.1
Page 2 of 3
Income Tax Act and Rules except for Research and Development Equipment which
is depreciated using a straight-line method in 5 equal annual installments.
7.       Depreciation on fixed assets deployed in drilling activity is ini-
tially capitalized as part of exploration or development costs and amortized
or depleted as stated above. Depreciation relating to production and trans-
portation activities is debited against income of the year.
Prior Period Adjustments
8.       All prior period adjustments for income and expenditure relating to
production and transportation activities are stated in the second part of the
Profit and Loss Account.
Inventories
9.       Stocks of crude oil from CTF point unwards in saleable condition not
taken note of up to 1980-81 have been stated at direct cost starting in 1981-
82. The change in the accounting policy was due to the accummulation of high
stocks which resulted from increased production and the insufficient capacity
of the domestic refineries. This policy will be adopted hereafter. Gas
stocks in pipelines are not taken note of since they cannot be measured.
10.      Inventories of stores and spares and assets for replacement, etc.,
are stated at historical cost. The "last-in, first-out" (LIFO) method of
inventory valuation is used for costing purposes.
Foreign CurrenL.y Transactions
11.      All expenditures incurred and liabilities undertaken in the form of
loans drawn and/or other liabilities are accounted for at the exchange rate
prevailing on the day of the transaction. No year-end adjustment for changes
in the foreign exchange rates in respect of outstanding liabilities were taken
note of until the Accounting Year 1980-81. Considering, however, the substan-
tial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, particularly that of U.S. Dollar,
year-end liabilities have been rewritten using the mean rate of exchange
prevailing at the close of business on 31st March, 1982. The difference
arising out of such adjustment and changes in the value of the cash balance
and certain adjustable advances held abroad have been adjusted to the relevant
head of account wherever feasible, otherwise, to the Profit and Loss Account.
Provisions
12.      Provisions are set up for all known and probable liabilities result-
ing from activities.
Jobs in Progress
13.      Workshop jobs in progress and unallocated expenditure are not amor-
tized until these are complete or identified to exploration or development.

Page 3 of 3
Retirement Benefits
14.      Gratuity is provided In respect of all employees taking 15 days
salary as payable for each completed year of service and this provision is
charged against income.
Interest Charges
15.      All interest charges are expended during the year of accrual.
Taxes
16.      Taxes are provided on income as determined after providing for amor-
tization and depletion in accordance with the agreement with the Government
u/a 42 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. For tax purposes total depreciation
charged, whether allocable to production and transportation, exploration or
development, is reckoned as an expense item charged against income during the
year.
Subsidies and Grants
17.      Receipts on this account are accounted for on a cash basis.  The
expenditure Incurred on the projects covered by subsldies and grants are,
however, accounted for on a normal accrual basis and expended during the year
of expenditure.
