3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Background
in i99i, Hungary's indigenous resources (coai, oii, natural gas and nuclear power) provided 53% of the
country's primary energy and imports (oil, natural gas, coal and electricity) came mainly from the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). During the year, 21% of total electricity consumption was

US$ of GNP in 1990 compared to 0.18 in Austria) and household electricity prices were at 70% of
economic cost recovery levels.
By 1994, Hungary was well advanced in economic reform and the creation of a fully-functioning market
economy. A comprehensive package of structural reforms had been initiated to increase competition,
tighten financial discipline and enhance productivity throughout the economy. National and local
authorities were moving towards commercialization and privatization in a variety of sectors.
Diversification of energy sources was an explicit policy objective and the Government was committed to a
well defined schedule of residential tariff increases to bring prices to cost-recovery levels by the end of
1995.
Although all electricity assets were still under state ownership, in 1992, a transmission company, eight
power gen.er-t:ling companies -A six Awer '.LiUUi c.4o-+JIU-5;U--_1-A.    ArlA --WL4A 1 M00

HUF 329 billion and shareholders' equity of HUF 301 billion. They also incurred a loss of almost HUF 3
billion during the year.
In macro-econormic terms, Hungary was classified as an upper-middle income country, with a 1992 GNP
per capita for its population of 10.3 million of $2,980. Inflation averaged 23% during that year, and the
unemployment rate averaged 12.7%. The Government's financial deficit was 2.4% of GDP, while the
trade deficit for 1992 was 0.4% of GDP.
Obiective
The objectives of the project were to: (i) reduce Hungary's dependence on energy imports from a single
source: (ii) increase efficiency, reliability and flexibility in the production of electricity and heat: and (iii)
establish the necessary basis for strong interconnection with the Western European Power Pool. In addition,
the Prniert wnuld suppnrt eontiniied -nvirnnmental imprnovemennts in the power sec1tnr nnd ns'siqt in
improving institutional capabilities.
The project objectives were clearly stated. They supported the country's objectives for the energy sector by
nelping to reinforce the economic supply of electric power ara neat and by improving associaxeu
environmental controls.  The objectives were also consistent with the Bank's assistance strategy that
supported policies and investments that encouraged market-based growth and social development.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original obJectives of tiie proJect re1mained unchanged tUrOUgnOUt the life of the project.
However, MVM's financial covenants under the loan were somewhat revised under the Quick Start Gas
Turbine Project, that became effective in July 1997, while the continuing restructuring and privatization of
the electricity industry during implementation increased the project's emphasis on the liberalization of the
power market.
3.3 Original Components:
MVM took formal responsibility for the project components as the Borrower. However, at the time of
Board approval, MVM had only part ownership in Dunamenti and the distribution companies that were
responsible for implementing some project components. MVM entered into a formal agreement with
Dunamenti on imnplementation of the Dunamenti component and on meeting certain financial targets.

The Project included a pr[gra-i[ of acuviLies UhiL cis-ibteu o1 uhe following corUA1pon1ei-iL.
Component A: Construction of one gas-fired combined cycle cogeneration plant of 235 MWe and 240
MWt at Dunamenti Ltd site, about 30 km southwest of Budapest, consisting of the following equipment:
(i) installation of a 145 MW gas turbine and auxiliary equipment; and
(ii) installation of a steam cycle equipment and the provision of associated civil works and ancillary
facilities at the plant site.
Component B: Upgrading of the Borrower's existing Energy Management System (EMS).
(i) Upgrading of the National Dispatch Center (NDC) through:
(a) replacement of the EMS master station at the NDC located in Budapest, with associated remote
facilities at mainr substatinons and power plants; and
(b) expansion and upgrading of the data communication network that will be required to support
the national EMS facilit:iep
(ii) Upgrading of the Regional Distribution Control Centers (RDCs) through:
(~a) P.-ov~isionof tJUl --A. mLd ES eqauipr.e.t Uand cor,puter;ation of four regiona! distr:bution
companies (in Debrecen, in Pecs, in Gyor, and in Budapest); and
(b) supply of remote terminal units and da-a concenuators to Lle selected Dis..IcLt i  a cpa LLI cnLer
of each of the respective regional distribution companies.
Component C: Human Resource Management and Training:
(i) provision of consultants' services and appropriate training to the HR Department of the Borrower to
upgrade its professional capacity in the areas of personnel management, development of human
resources policies and transferring of relevant methodologies to the Borrower's subsidiary companies;
(ii) provision of consultants' services and short-term intensive training at management level, focusing
on the Development, Economic and Operation Departments of the Borrower; and
(iii) training of the Borrower's personnel in selected areas and visits to professional meetings, courses,
conferences and similar events.
Component D: Environmental Management and Training:
(i) consulta.cy assistance in caying out an Envir-onmenta! Master Plan for the power sector;
(ii) training of the Borrower's staff in areas of environmental management, pollution control technology
fori power pla.s en.vi.v.n.e.tal a_ssmsrent, mo.deling (eeg/en-ivrnmenta! p!qami-1) Mronitoring

(iii} installation of water pollution, ambient air and noise level r-onitoring equipm11en.t on selec-ted si es.
The project was designed to support the original development objectives. Component A is supportive of ihe
first and second objectives by increasing generation capacity, improving the efficiency and reliability of
electricity supply and by extending the life of facilities. Comporient B supports Hungary's connection to the
Western European Power Pool (UCTE) and improvements in power system reliability, efficiency and cost
reduction. It also establishes necessary infrastructure for competitive electricity market. Components C and
D help to build institutional capacity in MVM in the areas of personnel, resource and environmental
management. Component D also helps with the introduction of pollution controls.
The project design drew upon lessons learned from other projects in the sector and country. Specifically, a
series of agreements and monitonring measures were agreed as part of project design to assist in maintaining

The components remnained the same throughout the life of the project. However, adjustments were made to
Uthe Enviro,1nmentaUMl Manageml-entL cUIUllpURIL as a result o[ -uiie privatizationi o1  th1 -ier-mai power plants.
Because of that, only Phase I (Diagnostic) of the Environmental Master Plan was completed. Phase n
(Identification of Priority Actions) and Phase -11 (Impiementation) of the Environmental Master Plan were
cancelled as all but one of the power stations concemed were privatized and the new owners made
environmental improvements of their own. The Vertes thermal power plant (that remains under 40%
ownership of MVM) has until the end of 2004 to implement actions to reduce emissions to the levels
stipulated in the Hungarian environmental regulations.
The privatization of Dunamenti power plant (component A) and all distribution companies (component
B(ii)) did not.change the scope of project components A and B, but had a significant impact on the project
implementation as detailed below.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
There was no Quality Assurance Group assessment of the project at entry.
The quality at entry of this project, as assessed in this ICR, is considered satisfactory. The development
objectives for the proiect are consistent with the Bank strategy and the Govenmment's priorities in Hungary
at the time of project appraisal and approval. Project design adequately reflected the development
objectives and identified priorities. Lessons learned from other projects in the sector/region were
incorporated into project design and taken account of during project preparation.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The overall outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory. The project is judged to have been successful
and to have achieved or exceeded all the project objectives.
1. Reduce Hungary's dependence on energy imports from a single source. While total net electricity
imports in 2000 were virtually unchanged from the 1992 figure (3,440 GWh, or about 100/n of gross
consumption), the proportion of gross inports supplied by the CIS declined from 55% in 1992 to 16%

diversity of import sources.
2. Increase efficiency, reliability and flexibility In the production of electricity and heat. The
Dunamenti and EMS components increased the efficiency of power generation in Hungary, both by
increasing the proportion of power generated in modem gas-fired combined cycle turbines, and by
facilitating more efficient disnatching of generating niants and transmission facilities Snecificallv at
Dunamenti, a unit was converted to combined cycle cogeneration, thereby increasing the power and

component was completed within budget but with a 14 month delay in the completion date for
conriiiiissioning of the plant. Deiays were caused by issues with project bidding documents; design and
implementation of control and instrumentation system; the performance of main contractor and
sub-contractors; failure of the steam turbines during the unit testing and start-up. However, despite these
problems, the gas fired combined cycle block (G2) is now operating economically, at high efficiency
(53.4% for electricity production) and availability (98.4% in 2000 instead of the contracted 96%).
Pollutant emissions parameters are low and comply with regulatory requirements. There has also been a
significant decrease (50% from 1994) in the emission of sulphur dioxide from the Dunamenti power plant
due the closure of old BEAD units which was made possible by the start of G2. This component is rated as
satisfactory.
Component B: Upgrading of Energy Management System (Cost: SAR - US$ 51.9 million/ US$35.2

companies. Implementation of this component established technical conditions for the synchronous
operation with the Western European Power Pool and the Hungarian power grid oecame a fulI member of
UCTE on May 17, 2001. The associated economic benefits include improved reliability of power supply,
increased security and available capacity of transmission network, sharing of spinning reserves with the
UCTE grid, improved dispatch of power facilities and better quality of electricity supply. The use of newly
introduced EMS functions should reduce network losses, improve load management and generation
dispatch, defer some operating and maintenance costs and improve transaction scheduling. Finally, the
EMS component established technical conditions for power market liberalization and introduction of an
Independent System Operator (MAVIR) on January 1, 2001. Overall this component is rated as highly
satisfactory.

Component D: Environmental Management and Training (Cost: SA - USS4.9 milon (iO0% -Wi-
financed), Actual - US$ 0.38 million total/ US$ 0.27 million WB loan). This program was completed on
time and within budget, albeit with a reduced scope of work. The amendment to the work plan was a result
of privatization in the power sector that commenced in 1995. Under this component an Environment
Management System was established for MVM that was certified to MSz EN ISO 14000 standards in
2001. The project provided assistance in the implementation of the National Grid's Environmental Project,
specifically with field evaluation of remediation plans and development of a monitoring system. As a result
environmental management in the power sub-sector has been enhanced and air pollutant emission values at
Dunamenti have been reduced substantially. This component is rated as satisfactory.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
At appraisal, the economic rate of return was calculated to be 16% for component A, the cogeneration
plant at Dunamenti (Annex 3). This was based on an assumed operating time, investments, transmission
losses, operating and maintenance costs. Benefits based on a willingness to pay were electricity sales and
heat sales to the refinerv. Dunamenti was privatized during the project implementation and a complete set
of data on the performance of the G2 unit after its commissioning was not made available to the ICR
mission bv the new owner. Conseauentlv revised estimateg of costs and benefits conuld not he made and the
economic rate of return could not be re-estimated.
A separate economic rate of return for the EMS, component B, was not calculated at appraisal. At the time,

aspects were handled by investigating the projected future financial performance of both MVM and
Dunamenti, and by including legal covenants designed to ensure'that both companies' financial performance
would be satisfactory.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
At appraisal a key Govemrnment objective in the energy sector was to continue with the reform and
restructuring of the Hungarian power sub-sector. The national energy strategy aimed at the "development
of organizational and control forrnulae corresponding to the market economy, and the control of monopoly
interests". In the power sub-sector, this necessitated a regulatory framework to ensure appropriate resource
allocations and cost recovery and to ensure that the public's safety and interest were well served. An
appropriate regulatorv framework was also needed to facilitate the entry of private interests in the energv
sector. Putting in place such organization and control was a necessary precondition for the opening up of
the TWncrarizn electririty mrk-et. Privirnc eontrol were needed to achieve nnti-m-2 cost nornhinntinnq on the

During the seven years of project imnplementation, MV-M Rt. has been transformed from being the dominant
force in all aspects of the Hungarian power sector, controlling not just transmission but also a majority of
the generating assets and half of the distribution systems, to being a transmission system operator meeting
the requirements of the European Union's Electricity Directive (96/92), with a limited continuing
involvement in power generation.  Consistency at the policy and regulatory levels, supported by
management strength of purpose, allowed this transition to be achieved successfully.
The evolution of MVM's financial structure reflects the downsizing and changing functions of the company
over the last seven years. The financial position of MVM Rt. has suffered from the write-offs that
accnmpanied the pnrivati7ation pnrneq,- and more rece-ntlv fmrm the Government's nolicv of holding down

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Energy Demand
The trend in energy demand reflects the growth of the economy and a trend towards lower intensity of use.
Total primary energy consumption, estimated at 1039 PJ in 2000, was 12% less than in 1991, but declined
much slower after 1995 when it was about 1067 PJ. At project appraisal, a 3% growth- had been- foreseen
for the period.   However, industrial restructuring, involving the closure of old, inefficient
energy-consumers; greater efficiency in energy utilization and reduced waste in industry and households
had a greater than expected impact on energy consumption. The share of primary energy consumption for
electricity generation and heat supply in public power plants declined from 40% in 1995 to 37% in 2000.
The Electricity Market
Total consum.ption of electricitv bottomeA out at 35.2 TW. h,i 1QQ!992 ater a stpep decline pfrom the historIc
peak of 40.7 TWh reached in 1989. From 1995 to 2000, the total consumption of electricity showed a
s,'I but a.   y :r.creas (abot 1 %) to 38.U6 TV lYI. IU 1.-ecer a  consu1wiJpuu'JI ofUelecuPctl haa
stabilized at around the level of 5.5 kWh per 1,000 HUF of GDP. Future demand growth may be very
much in line wih the volumre growthI of GDP, b-ut will be suoject to the continuing effects of indust-ial
restructuring and the upgrading of industrial plants. On a per capita basis, Hungary's electricity demand is
stiil iess than half that of Austria, 60% of the Czech Republic's, and marginally greater than Poland's.
The electricity sales increased from 28,356 (Wh in 1995 to 30,631 GWh in 2000. During that year,
industrial consumption of electricity amounted to 12,800 GWh, 4% higher than in 1995. Household
consumption in 2000 was 9,800 GWh, about the same as five years ago. This reflects the switch to more
efficient household appliances, but also a low rate of new house construction during the 1990s and an
increase in electricity tariffs. Consumption in households seems to have stabilized, and industrial and
service sector demand is expected to be the main driver of future consumption growth.
Fuel Costs
A further relevant aspect of the evolution of the electricity sub-sector, that is largely outside the control of
the GCovemment or the imnplemnenting agenry, has been th.e trend in input prices, most notnhly fie!.
According to US Department of Energy data, heavy fuel oil prices for electricity generation in Hungary fell

5.2 Factors generallv subiect to zovernment control:
The Economy
Since 1994 the overall climate for nolitical develonments in Hungarv has continued to be favorable to the
implementation of the project, and to the continued liberalization of the electricity sub-sector. The
eco.nnom. ha cshovnu steAudy m-ujth ,ith thi ectimratpd tnt_l GDP in 2000 hpino 5 10/ of the FU avernae and

Much of the industrial growth has been in electronics industries and automobile manufacture, while
traditional industries sucn as miing and chermicals have beenuir irelative decline. However, inflation, while
much reduced on the levels of previous years, was 10% in 2000, and long-term interest rates were twice the
EU level. Foreign direct investment over tne fnve years to 2000 totaied almost S90 oiiiion, inciuding
significant investments-in the energy sector.
The Electricity Law
The general direction of structural and regulatory change in the electricity sub-sector has been governed by
Act XLVIII of 1994 on the Production, Transport and Supply of Electric Energy (the 1994 Electricity
Law). The law defines the responsibilities of the Minister of Industry and Trade and the Hungarian Energy
Office and sets out the governing principles of consumer protection, safety, licensing of activities,
supervision of licensees, real estate issues, and the operation of the electricity market. The market is
defined in terms of a single buyer market model, with non discriminatorv rules of trade, but without
competitive access to the networks. This is the basic model under which the various changes in the industry
rince 19Q4 have been implemented, and under which all parts of the industrv worked until December 2001
when the new Electricity Law was passed. The new Law paves the way to the opening of at least 35% of

In 1994 MVM Rt. owned 50% of all generators and distributors, with the remaining 50% were held
directly by the State through APV Rt. in i995, in the first phase of privatization, APV Rt. substantiaily
sold its 50% shares in all six distribution companies and in two generating companies - Matra and
Dunamenti. In December 1995 MVM and APV carried out a share exchange. Accordingly, M-VM
transferred its 50% shareholdings in the distributors to APV, in return for which APV transferred its
approximately 50% shareholdings in Paks Nuclear Power Plant Ltd. and OVT (the grid operating
company) to MVM.
In further phases of privatization during the 1996-98 period, APV sold its remaining stakes in distribution,
and MVM and APV sold all or part of their remaining shareholdings in the generating business. MVM
ret2ined nwnerqhin of ahouit 250%4 of the shares in Matra and Dunamenti nower nlants- 40% in Vertesi

The privatization of MVM assets that occurred in the 1995-98 period, and the share transactions between
MVM and APV, generally resulted in book losses to MVM. This was partly because the prices at which
sales were made were lower than the value at which assets were held in MVM's books, and partly because
sales at such prices necessitated downward revaluations of any remaining shares held by MVM in the
companies concerned. The impact on MVM's balance sheet was estimated to be approximately HUF 100
billion, and about 20% of the companv'y issued canital was written off in IQ99 to rpflect more 2.^ru1rqtP1v

established about the time of project effectiveness. The duties of the HEO include the approval of
contractual iframeworks between companies in the sub-sector; consumer protection; the issuance of
operating licenses and the monitoring of compliance with license conditions and with the Electricity Act. In
1997 the HEO became responsible for the development or technical preparation of electricity tariffs,
although the actual approval of tariffs remained the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Trade
(recently the Minister of Economic Affairs), acting on behalf of the Government. In addition, the HEO
determines the information required from sector entities, such as cost-of-service studies, arbitrates disputes
between suppliers and consumers, and enforces the least-cost approach to the satisfaction of demand.
Tariff and Subsidy Policy
While the HEO operates as an independent arbiter of cost deterrninants in the electricitv sector, the actual
setting of prices has been carried out at political levels during the project implementation period. The
G.overnment has hpbn cn^erneAd to rchtrnin thp gmroth of rptnil prices hbth t^ asscit manufacturing
industry and to moderate the evolution of the retail price index, that has a knock-on effect on wages and
sl-i-4 Sl +ouhou the- eco1 .,y How--r the p",atati-on of the gener.tion and disu;b ition sub--seto-ra
has necessitated assuring a reasonable rate of return to investors. The reconciliation of these two rather
opposed policy objectives has oeen at the expense of MVNi Rt. Generators' seiing prices have been
allowed to rise in line with production costs, thus ensuring reasonable financial returns. Distributors' retail
selling prices have been set in relation to the Government's inflation objectives. Also, wholesale purchase
price was regulated to ensure that investors in the distribution business earn reasonable rates of return.
MVM, therefore, has borne market costs whilst earning regulated revenues, and its margin has suffered
accordingly.

by 45%, from 8% - 9% in 1999 and 2000 to less than 5% in 2001. By July 1, 2001, due to pressure from
tne distribution companies, the purchase price increase for distribution was decreased to 6% tirough
modification of the decree on electricity prices. With this intervention, the order of magnitude of the yearly
margin of the distribution companies (for 2001) was restituted and restriction of MVM's margin continued.
As a result of this measure, MVM's margin turned negative. MVM incured losses on this margin, and the
company's solvency has been maintained by direct bugetary transfers from the Government, amounting to
HUF 32 billion for 2001.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
MVM started the project preparation in 1991 and formned two project tearns. The first team was responsible
for the Dunamenti G2 block and included representatives of the plant. The second team was responsible for
the EMS project and included representatives of regional distribution companies, power plants and the
national dispatch center. The overall management and coordination was provided by MVM's Strategy and
Development Division and the Infrastructure Development Department. Both teams carried out preparatory
and imnlementation tasks professionally and efficiently until the privatization of Dunamenti power nlant
and distribution companies in 1995-1996. The private owners requested changes in project implementation
and accnrdingly the first tP:Im was prncti"lly rethdced to the Dunamenti stafr while the second tenm
continued as a joint task force headed by an MVM project manger. The joint team set an excellent example
of effective project rnarnagement *hroughn intensive coordination and active resolution of cor-plex and
challenging implementation issues of the large EMS project.
From 1996 until the project completion in 1998, the implementation of the gas fired combined cycle G2
block was tie responsibility of Dunamenti Eromu Rt. a subsidiary oi uine iractabel Group. Most oi tne
project delay occurred during this period and some delays were undoubtedly due to the major change in
plant management and restructuring of the company which included a reduction of 35% of staff. However,
the main reasons for project delay are related to the under performance of contractors, specifically failures
of newly installed steam turbines during the start-up and commissioning due to structural deficiencies in
turbine manufacturing.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The total project cost, excluding duties and taxes, was US$184.6 million equivalent, of which US$67.3
million was funded by the World Bank Loan and US$117.3 million was financed by MVM and Dunamnenti.
These figures compare to the appraisal estimates of US$197.4 million for the total cost and US$92.5
million for the Bank-financed part. The unused portion of the World Bank Loan (US$32.7 million) was
canceled. This compares to the total project contingencies of US$31.3 million estimated at the appraisal.
The detailed proiect costs and financing are shown in Annex 2.
After the cnmpletion of the G2 hlock at Dunamenti- the privateowner of unamnmenti decided to prepay a
portion of the World Bank Loan used for this component. Therefore, the amount of US$31.0 million was

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
The sustainability of the project objectives is highly likely. The reasons for this assessment derive, inter
alia, from the positive political climate in Hungary, the steadfastness of the reform process in general, and
the well-established and widely-accepted principles underlying the restructuring and privatization process
in the electricity sector. The confidence that foreign investors have shown in the sector supports this
judgrnent.
The market and regulatory arrangements summarized below are robust, and, when accompanied by
continued high standards in public policy-mkring and in the governanc-e of MVM Rt., provide a sustainable
basis for long-term benefits both from this project and from Hungary's continuing process of reform in the

Future Electricity Market
Tlne new Electricity Law details the future sector restructuring and market model that aims to:
*   ensure that the market takes over price regulation;
*   increase competition and consumer satisfaction;
* achieve transparent market operation and regulation;
*   assure free access to the transmission and distribution network;
*   strengthen environmental protection;
*   promote energy saving; and
*   encourage the utilization of altemative energy sources.
Parallel "Public Utility", i.e. non competitive, and Comnetitive Power markets are envisaged. Within the
"Public Utility" market, MVM will be the wholesaler and the six regional distributors will be the retailers

allowed to import up to 50% of their needs.
The Independent System Operator, MAVIR Rt., will be responsible for balancing the power system,
integrating short- and long-term capacity plans and trade contracts, and operating a price monitoring
system to increase transparency. The Law sets out rules on stranded costs (projected to be about HUF 50
billion in the 2003-2010 period), strengthen the status of the system operator, promotes the use of
renewable energy, and provides for a distribution network code and a conmnercial code, as well as a grid
code.

Future Regulatory Environment
The independence of the HEO is expected to be reinforced as part of the continuing reform process. The
Office's Director General and his deputy were appointed by the Prime Minister for fixed terms of six years
and are removable only for specific reasons. In the case of appeals against HEO decisions, the final
decision will be a matter for the courts to decide instead of the Minister of Economic Affairs. The
financing of HEO operations will continue to be from fees.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The EMS component of the project is in full operation. The first phase (SCADA system) started in June
1999 and the second phase (complete EMS) was commissioned in September 2001. The new dispatch
system calls for continuous improvements particularly in relation to the eventual liberalization of the
electricity market:
* the system shall be continuously maintained in accordance with the signed maintenance contracts with
the supplier;
* the process control system should be expanded to accommodate developments in the nower eTid (e.g.

For Component C, Human Resource Management and Training, a human resource strategy is under
preparation. This will address training, development and management of human resources. A new training
model is also proposed.
Work will continue with preparation for market deregulation, successful participation in a competitive
market and accession to the European Union. Operating procedures will be regulated to ensure they meet
the quality control measures introduced in 2000.

restructuring of MVM and planned privatization of parts of the company, including Dunamenti and the
distribution enterprises, that would benefit directly from the project.

This Project has had a significant importance for both MVM Rt. and other participants of the energy
secLor. ILt was U.e seco,-.d 'ivUyoIu Bank Loan LU0 LVIDV rVI ILDt. and the fiustonc, vvhe.-e t  wLs -
Rt., with the guarantee of the Hungarian State. Preparation of the project began in 1991. Work teams were
set up for the two major project components. Tnese teams consisted of experts fromii vvivi, DuRnaenti
Power Station (for the G2 component), regional distribution companies and power stations (for the
EMS/SCADA component) and engineeringiconsulting firms. MVM's performance was satisfactory,
especially since it carried out most of the preparatory work (including feasibility studies) before inviting the
Bank to finance the project.
7.S Government implerimentation performance:
The Government's implementation performance was satisfactory as demonstrated by its policy and reform
actions. Furthermore, the steadfast approach to reform, the continued privatization of generators and
distributors, and the restructuring of MAVIR, all contributed to the creation of a rational structure for the
electricity sub-sector. In addition, the effort put into the drafting of the new Electricity Law provides
comfort to operators and potential investors, while the strengthening of the Hungarian Energy Office will
enhance the protection of consumers as well as market players.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
MVM project implementation team exemplified a high degree of professionalism and skill in dealing with
complex implementation issues of the large SCADA/EMS project and managing a joint task force
including renresentatives of four privatized distribution companies. MVM's financial performance
improved during the project implementation and after 1998 MVM fully met all covenants. The recent
deterioration in MVM's fianncial position is mainly related to the tariff structure which is beyond the
company's control. MVM's performance during the project implementation is rated satisfactory.

The Importance of Reform and Restructuring
The commitment of the Hungarian Government to rapid reform and restructuring of the electricity
sub-sector decisively reinforced the benefits of the investments made under this project. The Hungarian
Government's active program of privatization and regulatory development ran in parallel with the

process as Hungary was ten years ago. Also, it shows that the Bank is able to participate in investment
progrdms im cases where siructrdi and regulatory- reform is a Government priority.
Thie Need for Economic Pricing
A recent reluctance of the Government to expose the Hungarian consumer to the full costs of electricity
supply - understandable though such reluctance may be in the context of anti-inflation and other policy
considerations - constrains the ability of MVM Rt to plan confidently for the future needs of the sector
weakens the company's credit worthiness. This shows that the independence of energy regulation and
economic pricing remain key performance indicators to monitor and evaluate in the energy sector well after
its restructuring and privatization.
The Benefits of Good Project Management
The highly professional and motivated management orovided by MVM Rt throughout the imnlementation
process was a crucial ingredient in the Project's success, and underlines the importance - both for Borrower
and Bank - of ensuiring that the inititutinnn1 and mrnagement arrangements in place are apprpnriate to the
project's size and complexity. Such arrangements not only assure the effectiveness of the investments, but
also reduce t-he -M-1nsaction costs -associat-ed ~with ift.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Beneftis
A 16% economic rate of return was calculated for the Dunamenti Combined Cycle (Co-generation) niant.
Component A. This was based on the following assumptions:
*   the G2 unit operates for 6500 hours per year and produces (annually) 3120 GWh of electricity and
2555 TJ of heat
*   the benefits based on willingness to pay consist of electricity sales, valued at the 1992 average revenue

*   the costs consist of: investment expenditures in Dunamenti G2; allowance for investments to replace
old tranemiq-ion and distrihution facilities: fuel costs; lones in tranrmi-qion and diitrihiition at the
1990 level of 10.9% of net generation; operating costs for Dunamenti G2 and its transmission and
rlictr,h to
*   annual depreciation is measured as a constant percentage of assets, that were newly revalued in 1992.
This was used in place of average incremental cost as a measure of the investment cost in transmission
and distribution since the system will have surplus capacity for many years to come.
*   fuel valued at the economic cost of gas to MVM power stations, equal to US$2.71/ GJ
* foreign costs converted at the corresponding year's rate
Dunamenti was privatized during the implementation period and a complete set of data on the performance
of the G2 unit after its commissioning was unavailable to the ICR mission. Consequently, revised estimates
of costs and benefits could not be made, and the economic rate of return could not be re-estimated.

2      Project Objectives
The project would support Hungary's reform program by'mitigating the country's dependence on energy
imports from single source; by increasing efficiency, reliability and flexibility in the production of
electricity and heat; and by establishing the necessary basis for strong interconnection with the Western
European Power Pool. In addition, the Proiect would support continued environmental improvements in the
power sector, and assist in improving institutional capabilities.
3      Background
Ten years ago the Hungarian electricity scertnr c-nnsictid of 2 si lng!e company: the himng2rinn Power
Company operating in the form of an industrial trust.
This vertically integrated company incorporated all public utility generators, the power grid and the
uismounon network as we;I as te uisinoutiun cumpauuic directuy suppyuing pouw[r 'o 'uie   umelI. u,c
past decade fully changed the structure of the industry.
As a first step the trust was reorganized into a concem-like organization with two levels of economic
entities via the separation of the generation, transmission and distribution activities. Parallel to this process
the previous system of centralized instructions applied by the planned economy was replaced by the
contractual relationship between the entities. Act XLVIII of year 1994 on the generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity defined the framework for the sector's new type of operation as well as the
responsibilities of the state vis-a-vis the power industry.
- 25 -



As a second step a significant part of the generators and the distribution business as a whole were
privatized which, beyond diminishing the state indebtedness, resulted in the appearance of investment
capital required for development purposes.
Presently the process of the third transformation phase is underway: i.e., the preparation for the
liberalization of the market.
3.1    Restructuring of the MVM Group and Privatization of the Electricity Sector
The significant preconditions to attracting investment capital into the electricity sector via privatization
have been established, on the one hand, through the restructuring of the Hungarian Power Companies Trust
in 1992, and on the other hand, through the official declaration of the new Electricity Act in 1994.
The method as well as the scheduling of privatization were regulated by Government Resolutions the most
important of which was Resolution No. 1114/1994 defining the new ownership structure to be developed in
the sector though privatization.
Privatization started in 1995 and the last transaction that was made in the spirit of the above mentioned
Government Resolutinn took nlace at the end of 1997. As a result of this process the presently nrevailing
structure of ownership in the sector had evolved.
In consideration of the ownership conditions the privatization brought the following important changes for

state ownership as well as PA Rt. (Paks Nuclear Power Plant) and OVIT Rt. (National Power Line
Company Ltd.) practically in iO0% ownership of MVM Rt.
* MVM was left with 25% + I share as ownership in the privatized Dunamenti Power Plant Rt. and
Matra Power Plant Rt.; the former one having the biggest, the latter one the third biggest installed
capacity in the power system.
*   MVM Rt. also has a significant share of ownership in the non-privatized Vetes Power Plant Rt.
*   MVM Rt. has fully withdrawn from the power distribution sub-sector.
3. A    hanges in tne r inancia; l iruatin of ivi VI. Beiween ;   Z5 anu ;Y
The privatization of the Hungarian electricity sector, taking place between 1995 and 1998 brought
significant changes in the assets of M1VM Rt. in 1994, one year prior to the privatization, the equity
investments of MVM Rt. in the electricity industry - embodied in the 50% of the share capital of the power
companies - amounted to HUF 259 Billion, which equals to about 79%/o of the total assets of MVM Rt. At
the end of the privatization process, the proportion of equity investments to total assets was reduced to 49%
(less than HUF 152 Billion). The loss of assets of about HUF 107 Billion can be attributed to the write-off
of assets only to a lesser extent (the write-off was HUF 5.8 Billion in 1995, 2.8 Billion in 1996, 8.6 Billion
in 1997 and 4.0 Billion in 1998, in total HUF 21.2 Billion), while the majority of it was related to the
privatization process.

the shares of Paksi Atomeromtl Rt. and OVIT Rt. amounted only to HUF 65.4 Billion. The difference (no
less than HUE 55 Billion) was accounted in the DOOKS of IVIMV Rt. as an extraoruinary loss.
1The partial sale of the MVM-owned shares of the Dunamenti and Matrai power plants and the full sale of
the shares of Tiszai power plant were realized in 1996. The sale of further Dunamenti shares and all the
shares of Budapesti power plant in 1997, and the full sale of the shares of Bakonyi and Pecsi power plants
in 1998 followed. The book value of the privatized shares of these generation companies was close to HUF
30 Billion.
The sale of investments during the privatization process was accompanied by a significant capital loss: it
was mainly the result of the asset swap with APV Rt. in 1995, but to a lesser degree it could also be
attributed to the privatization of the, shares of the generation companies below book value. The
extraordinary losses of HUTF 57.9 Billion in 1995, 9.5 Billion in 106 and !0 5 Rillinin in 1007 are a!l
linked closely to the privatization process.
Because of these losses, the equity capital of MVM Rt. reduced between 1994 and 1998 from HUF 301.2

showed a negative balance of more than HUF 75 Billion, so the equity capital of the company sank well
beiow the stock capital of iLHur 249.6 Biiiion (the capital reserve was Hiur 52.3 Biiiion).
The inevitable alignment of the equity structure was made in 1999. The stock capital was reduced by HUF
49.9 Billion and the capital reserve by 21 Billion, and these funds were used for the replenishment of the
profit reserve. After the stock capital reduction, the nominal value of the shares was devaluated from HUF
10,000 to 8,000.
The new regulatory framework that commenced in 1996 ensured the application of regulated prices for
electricity allowing for an 8 percent normative return on the assets for all of the companies in the electricity
sector. However the consistent application of these princiDles would have led to drastic price hikes. because
the end-user price for electricity was previously held at an artificially low level. Consequently the
Government decided to abandon itS claim for dividends in regyard to the stnte-owned companies of the
electricity sector, thus the announced prices not only reduced the calculated profit rate of MVM Rt. to zero,

4,     a V luation of Ir ple..en-dat:on
This Project has had significant imnportance for both MVM Rt. and other participants of the energy sector.
This was the second World Bank Loan Agreement of MVM Rt. and this was the first one, which Borrower
was MVM Rt. itself with the guarantee of the Hungarian State. The first World Bank Loan Agreement -
Loan No: 2697-HU - was taken out by the Hungarian State in 1986 and was closed in 1996.

The preparation of the project began in 1991. Work teams were set up for the two major sub-projects.
These teams consisted of experts from MVM Rt, Dunamenti Power Station (for G2), regional distribution
companies and power stations (for EMS/SCADA) and engineering/consulting firms.
The World Bank provided support for MVM Rt. (and the sector) to prepare for the interconnection to the
Western European Power System. A very important point of project implementation is that after or due to
privatization the common execution of EMS/SCADA sub-project was not broken, the harmonization of
(occasional) different interests was successfully solved by the exemnlarv cooneration of the participating
experts. It was only Dunamenti Power Station who wanted to get rid of the World Bank Loan Agreement
nn'1 the rnnnip-t.d ionnnp-rtinn with MVM Rt's nnfd World B2nt's expenrts as soon  possible. The snli!tinn
for making this was an early repayment of its loan amount.
4.1    Major factors effecting implementation
iJunulg iLs lorng life, tiie ruuject was uifluencedi by severai serious changes:
* Following the privatization of the regional electric utilities, the contract structures had to be revised,
and the new owners' interests had to be taken into account.
* Implementation of the telecommunication system was delayed, increasing the operating costs of MVM
(leased telecommunication lines).
* Due to the two-phase implementation of the EMS/SCADA System, MVM and the regional electric
utilities had to mobilize more financial resources.
* The scope of the Project was extended several times (Region "E" in telecommunication, EMS/SCADA
System hardware upgrade, software additions, back-up metering system, reconstruction of the NDC
(MAVIR) building, etc.).
*   Struchtral and technical changes of the regional utilities required modifications in the EMS/SCADA
System (new substations, combining and moving DDCs).
*   Following the structu ral chan.ges of the MVM, the NDC was separated from MVM and has being
operated as MAVIR (Hungarian Power System Operator Company Ltd.) from I January 2001, which

Specific details are provided below.
Part A - Delay in project preparation
The project preparation docufen-te were prepared and issuled in delay and the related conntrcts were also
conducted in delay due to the following reasons:
* complete revision of the consulting draft tender document and as a consequence, delay in the contract
conc;-wiun WiuLn rnnedy wnkin u r.q.
*   change in the World Bank standard Bidding Documents for the turnkey implementation of the Steam
Cycle (the World Bank introduced a new sample document including a very long two stage Bidding
Procedure).
* elimination of the deficiencies in the draft tender document for the turnkey implementation of the Steam
Cycle.
Part A - Control and Instrumentation
The control and instrumentation design and implementation activities were shifted to SKODA Controls
(Czech Republic) and further to SIEMENS KWU (Germany). SKODA Turbiny and SKODA Controls
(both Czech Republic) were not able to define the right contractual scope and there were many discussions

amonnc the nlwhnntr-Art-ors on this is<iue (asa conclusion, SIEMFNS KWI J shniild have been promoted as a
direct Sub-contractor of MITSUI).
Major problems during design and implementation:
* gas turbine diverter damper operation
* automatic start-up of the HRSG and the steam turbines
* gas turbine - steam cycle interface
* alarm sequence recording
All problems were solved at site during commissioning.
Part A - The role of MITSUI (Japan) and its Subcontractors
Though, in its bid MITSUI (Japan) presented acceptable technical references, its activity in respect of the
contract was shown only in the general and contractual commercial issues (insurance, Letter of Credit,
pavments, etc.), and the supervision of the technical activities was shifted to its Subcontractors (CMI-
Belgium and SKODA Turbiny - Czech Republic).
The Subcontractors did not perform their obligations properly and as a consequence, incomplete designs
we.re prepared w-rith inferior quality an-d contracts were concluded in a delay with oth.er subcontractors. The
latter case was especially characteristic for the control and instrumentation resulting in a delay of
app.-o0-&uaIUly U-I M  r uIS VI uRe Cor.ILplIet:.o LDedUli1n.
Part A - Faiiure of the steam turbines
A considerable delay was also caused by the failure of the steam turbines. The condensing steam turbine
was damaged on March 10, 1998. One segment in the stiffening shroud in stage 4 of the high pressure rotor
blades has broken off during operation and damaged the other intemal parts of the high pressure turbine.
The reason of the damage was a crack in the rivet smash during manufacturing.
After the repair in the turbine factory Plzen (Czech Republic) the turbine was restarted on April 29, 1998.
The back pressure steam turbine was blocked and repaired in the above factory twice: between June 5, and
August 20, 1998 and between September 5, and November 13, 1998.
The technical investigation showed that reason of the damage was the improper drain system of the lower
turbine casing. In order to allow the proper drainage. a new drain channel was manufactured bvyassing the
turbine stages and resulting some loss in electricity production. The new system and new operation
inetn tonnc nmrovided th. annod tPr-h1ninn nvAinhil4iv yf the hbrac nresiire thurhine.

As the biggest Plant in Hungary, the Plant was privatized in 1996. The Tractebel (Belgium) as the new
Owner created a new Plant setup diagrain and cut the stafi by approximately 35%. Tractebel decided to
repay the provided loan to MVM and to settle the commercial and contractual problems with MITSUI.
Part A - Settlement of commercial and contractual Problems
The above delay and damages did not make possible to issue the Operational Acceptance by the Employer
(it was not even requested by the Contractor). In order to promote the situation and-to use the Plant in the
meantime a separate Minutes was signed by the Parties on October 7, 1998. The Minutes declared that the
24 month Defect Liability Period for the Plant started on August 21, 1998 and it shall be extended for the
back pressure turbine by the period of its second repair.

AU other remaining contractual issues were settled in the Memorandum of Understanding dd. August 31,
1999 and Amenuinent to the Contr-act Agrerement wh'ich became effective on June 30, 2000. Major issues of
the Amendment to the Contract Agreement:
*   payment for spare parts,
*   payment for training,
*   payment for 10% of the Contract Price and counter payment of the same amount for liquidated
damages of delay,
*   payment for 5% of the Contract Price.
As the Letter of Credit expired on December 31, 1999, all payments were effected by direct transfer
between the Employer and the Contractor.
The Operational Acceptance Certificate was issued on the date of effectiveness of the Amendment to the
Contra-t Agreemtennt The Final rne.rt-inn:n Arcpnta2ncP Cr,-r:ft2tt was issued on Ne v'MnhPr m 7 2000.W

MVM has initiated negotiations with Siemens on the implementation schedule several times and finally an
agreement was made on a two-phase implementation. In the first phase Siemens provided a SCADA system
for the NDC and RDCs with RTUs and data concentrators. The system of NDC was also suitable for
performing automatic generation control tasks.
In the second implementation phase the systems became redundant, were extended with the EMS functions,
advanced applications and, in the case of the NDC and ELMti systems, with dispatcher training simulators.
Thus, the scope of the original contract was implemented almost completely. The technical specification,
developed prior to signing the contract, defined verv detailed future demands, some of them not even
existing at that time, that could not be provided completely. Had standard demands been specified, the
imnlementation might not have suffered such a delavy

During the implementation structural (two-phase implementation) and quantitative changes had to be made,
covered by eight Change Order Agreements.
Up to the split of the implementation into two phases, cooperation with Siemens Energy and Automation
Inc. was difficult, the responses to the problems and questions came slowly and far between. After signing
of the agreement for splitting the implementation into two phases, the contractor made resources available
and the nrogress became accentable.

functions (e.g., the TMN system) included in the contract, therefore, the MVM applied the sanctions it was
entitled to under the contract, i.e. ITALTEL was obliged to pay liquidated damages and a part of the
Performance Bond was used.
Part B - Domestic Activities
The domestic activities - apart from those hindered by the delay in EMS/SCADA and the associated
telecommunication system - were implemented according to the original time schedule.

Part D
The parties prepared a detailed Work Plan for the project which served as a basis for the activities.
However, the parties deemed necessary to amend the contract, even clirectly after the signing procedure. T ne
reason of this was the privatization commenced in the power sector in 1995, prior to which evaluation of
the environmental performance of the companies in the power sector had been initialled. The results and
experience gained thorough this process had to be included in the Plan and certain tasks became
unnecessary.
The privatization itself required some further modifications: the parties had to understand that the
privatized power plant companies did not demand the advantages provided by the Plan, but being individual
and private companies, refused these possibilities. Therefore, the Work Plan had to be further reduced.
Regardless of the modifications mentioned above, the contractual parties remained engaged and the
governmental organiations (fitst of all the Ministry of Envi.ro.nmet Protertion) supported the work
efficiently.
S      Environmental protection
Tne emission values of tre Dunamenti Power Station are determined basic-ally by tie quanLity anid quality
of utilized fuels, ratio of the used oil and natural gas, and the characteristics of the power engineering
technology. Only from 1987 through 1991, the emissions from the BEAD blocks for heat supply were
7000-12000 tons of sulphur dioxide, 177-3000 tons nitrogen oxide, as well as 370-630 tons solid materials
each year.

In addition to the electrical energy production, the aim of the G1 combined cycle block was to supply the
neigh'Doring oii refmery with steam, which was earlier provided mainly by the "BEAD" part of the power
plant. The G1 block alone, however, was not able to meet the steam demand of the oil refinery, the hot
water demand of the power station and the town, the process steam demand of the power plant, therefore
the G2 combined cycle block had to be implemented.
The G2 block was implemented in two stages; the GT unit was commissioned at the beginning of 1996, the
trial operation of the heat recovery steam generator-steam turbine unit was completed on 31 May, 1998.
The implementation of the above mentioned projects made changes not only in the power engineering
technology, but in terms of the environmental protection as well. The new combined cycle - mainly natural
gas fired - gas turbine blocks are characterized by the extremely high efficiency and the low air pollution.
In addition to the ahbve, the npwer plant iunits are u tili7ing so ca!led power plant oil of redrieed suilphur
content instead of heavy heating oil used earlier (sulphur content at about 3%) and instead of burning of

and shutuown oi the o01 DBEADL ana L" units.
The question of environmental control had major importance during the initial stage of the project.
Dunamenti Power Station guaranteed to keep the emission values at low level, and to construct an emission
and immission environmental monitoring system, of which the emission monitoring system was
implemented.
6      TECHNICAL Performance Requirements
Part A
The major technical requirements for Part A are as follows:
*   high total efficiency of the combined cycle unit. which was fulfilled on the basis of the guarantee
measurement performed (53,36 % for the el. production).
*   high availability of the comnbined cycle iunit to ensire power generation, 17 bar steam and disrict
heating (98,4 % in 2000 instead of the contractual 96 %).
*   tA.flcompli*ance of -Se envirJlfmelntafl iss:.o . n, va-e -ith the  j*- prsc-t. fons, TVich was fulfilled

the UCTE system. The Hungarian electric power system is a full member of the UCTE power pool since 17
Mylay 2I.0.
Thanks to its instailed interfaces, the system meets the requirement that, foliowing the necessary software
extensions, the NDC (MAVIR), as an independent system operator, will be able to perform the tasks
required in the liberalized energy market.
In case of the regional electric utilities where the operations control was not supported by process control
systems earlier, state-of-the-art dispatcher systems were realized. The installed data concentrators made it
possible for the regional utilities to implement their district dispatcher centers.
Introduction of advanced applications (automatic generation control, voltage/var control, network
applications) resulted in the decrease of the network losses for all users.

The above figures prove that the EMS/SCADA System Project implemented the extended technical content
approved by the management (additional Siemens deliveries, taking over Power Plant RTUs, security
enhancement, implementation of telecommunication region "E", SWTS relocation, additional
telecommunication spare parts, installation of six 400-kV busbar potential transformers, additional resident
nmorammning' additional engineering sunnort. etc-); including HACMP imnlementation. within the cost and
contingency budget provided in the modified Investment Program.

Complying with the stipulations of the Loan Agreement, MVM submitted quarterly Progress Reports to the
Bank presenting the progress and the problems raised in the course of the implementation phase. The Bank
reviewed the progress of the Project implementation and the use of the loan through its annual missions.
Power engineering skills of the Bank's representative provided great support in clarifying the problems with

Part A
Phase I. (untii the privatization). An "on-site management team" was set up to coordinate the preparation
and implementation of the G2 project performing first of all the preparatory functions for decision making
and supervision purposes. Its main task was to prepare plans for the scope of preparation and
implementation of the project, for division of liability, costs, time schedule, quality and orders of procedure.
In addition, the team provided supervision of any deviations from the contract. MVM Rt. delegated a
project manager and a coordinator into the project organization set up.

the site management team, however, the overall supervision of the major milestones and payment were

Part C
The MVM paid major attention to the training courses and progress of the personnel, partly due to its
previous position. The previous training-planning practice had to be modified according to the new
situation of the company. Following the formulation of the training priorities, the requirements of the
various professional areas had to be coordinated. A substantial part of the financing for training came from
the budget of each department
The major part of the training courses was financed from own resources: anyway, the use of the available
foreign currency budget would be unreasonable for local training courses due to exchange costs.
The breakthrough was more difficult in the case of top manager training because they have been
overIonded huit the training of the middle mrnnoerq and would-he managers started the desired change in
the attitude. The participation in the training courses is a natural and permanent demand of the new

important. The participation reaches 75% of the workforce. The cost of training is 4% of the costs of
salaries and wages.
One of the key factors in the high quality operation of the company is the well-organized, efficient and
continual training, the employees' commitment to their personal progress. This commitment is further
strengthened by the training support provided by the company, well above the Hungarian average.
The MVM considers training as an investment promising higher-than-average profits in the future and
being of crucial importance for maintaining its competitive edge.
The knowledge and expertise gained by the employees of the company, the transfer of this knowledge and
the utilization of the resulting synergies are things on which more emphasize could be put in future training
and day-to-day oneration.

Part A
in accordance with the present technical standard, the G2 gas fired combined cycle unit (Part A) is
operating at high efficiency and availability and low pollutant emission parameters. Therefore, the
availability of the combined cycle unit is extremely high, on the long term, the operation of the G2 unit is
advantageous and economical for Dunamenti Power Station. The production data of the Plant and G2 unit
in 2000 were as follows:
