3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Objectives: The development objectives of the project were to:
a. improve environmental conditions and reduce health hazards in Greater Bursa caused by: (i)
inadequate collection, and lack of treatment of municipal and industrial sewage; (ii) seasonal flooding
in some areas because of poor stormwater drainage; and (iii) inadequate domestic solid waste disposal,
and lack of hazardous solid waste management;
b. improve the institutional arrangements regarding the management of municipal water supply, sewer
services, and of domestic and hazardous solid waste;
c. meet the demand for water supply, sewerage, flood protection and solid waste services, including the
demand from the poor living on the fringes of the city;
d. postpone the need to develop new water resources by improving the efficiency of water usage by
reducing the volume of non-revenue water from the high level of 63%; and
e. implement appropriate cost recovery policies.
Assessment: The objectives were clear, realistic and important for the country given the prevailing context
in which they were defined. Consistent with the overall country assistance strategy, the sector strategy for
water and sanitation sought to: (i) improve the standards of living of the population, particularly
low-income, by provision of adequate water and sanitation services; (ii) alleviate environmental degradation
from sewage, and from domestic and industrial wastes; and (iii) pursue institutional reform in the sector by
continuing to support the commercialization of newly created municipal water utilities such as BUSKI that
had been separated from their parent municipal departments. The choice of Bursa for assistance was
justified since Greater Bursa was one of the largest urban areas in Turkey with a population of about
840,000 in 1990; about 23 percent of the city's households were classified as low-income; water service
coverage, though relatively high at 90 percent, was in need of improvement, including extension to
under-served areas; sewerage coverage was only 70 percent, and municipal and industrial wastewater was
being discharged untreated, mainly into the Nilufer River where water quality was rated in the lowest class
(Class IV); the high and growing pollution in the Sea of Marmara to which Bursa was contributing; and
the rising incidence of water-borne disease. While the investments under the project were substantial, they
were not unusually complex or risky, or unduly demanding in regard to the implementation capacities of
the Borrowers, Bursa Water and Sanitation Company (BUSKI) and Bursa Metropolitan Municipality
(BMM) which were to be augmented by suitable technical assistance.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original objectives were not revised.

3.3 Original Components:
Components: The original components of the project were the following:
(A)    Water supply works and equipment needed to:
(i)   renovate existing springs to improve their production from 12.7 million m3 (mm3) per year to
their estimated capacity level of about 19.7 mm3 per year; a total of 35 km of new pipelines were to be laid
on the mountain side; (ii) rehabilitate existing distribution networks by replacing each year, for three
years, about 3.5 percent (1,000 km of pipes) of the most unsatisfactory sections of the existing network;
(iii) increase the production of well-fields by about 32 mm3 per year by constructing 10 new wells and
improvements in pumping stations; (iv) construct a distribution reservoir of 30,000 m3 capacity to
provide storage capacity needed for the increased water demand; and (v) construct main pipelines (70 km)
to extend the supply to new distribution networks and improve the supply in existing networks; and extend
existing distribution networks to supply new consumers in new areas covering 810 hectares (ha).
(B)    Sewerage works and equipment needed to:
(i)    extend the existing collection networks by constructing: new collectors totalling 5.4 km and
collection networks to serve 140 ha in the industrial north of the city; new networks covering 660 ha in
areas to be served by existing collectors, the existing networks being converted into stormwater drainage
networks; and new sewer connections in the above mentioned areas covering 660 ha; and (ii) treat and
dispose sewage flows collected by the sewerage networks by two-phased construction of wastewater
treatment plants in East and West Bursa. The first phase for each plant was to include pre-treatment works
and anaerobic ponds of 134,000 m3 per day and 46,000 per day capacity. The second phase was to add
secondary treatment of 161,000 m3 per day and 74,000 m3 per day respectively, and sludge treatment
facilities.
(C)   Stormwater drainage works and equipment needed to:
(i)   rehabilitate the existing networks covering 4,582 ha including completion of the network,
replacement of damaged pipes, constructing proper catchment areas and manholes, and cleaning of the
pipes; (ii) construct three open channel interceptors of a total length 9 km in the southem part of the city
to avoid clogging of the stormwater drainage system; and (iii) extend the collection system by laying about
14.2 km of collectors and construction of networks in new areas covering about 337 ha.
(D)   Technical assistance to B USKI for:
(i)   project implementation including: detailed design and construction supervision; survey and
investigations needed for proper mapping of the water supply and sewerage systems; and staffing of a
Project Management Unit (PMU); and (ii) institutional development including: (a) a twinning arrangement
with a reputable water supply and sewerage operator to assist BUSKI in designing and implementing an
Action Plan consisting of training for staff and management; increasing the volume of water billed; an
Asset and Capital Investment Management System; a Management Information System; and a new tariff
schedule that would help promote water conservation, control water pollution, and ensure BUSKI's
financial viability; and (b) a consultant study to determine the feasibility of a contractual arrangement
between BUSKI and a private operator.
-3-



(E)    Solid waste works and equipment needed to:
(i)    rehabilitate the existing unregulated disposal area including fire controls, stream diversion, bund
construction, control of leachate, regrading and planting, collection ditches, and venting of landfill gas; (ii)
develop a new landfill site of 10 ha in Hamiltler Valley X; (iii) construct a waste transfer station for 600
tons per day including tipping halls, weighbridges, mobile grab, loader and tractors; (iv) provide collection
vehicles for municipal waste and industrial waste; and (v) provide facilities for two clinical waste
incinerators of 0.5 tons per hour unit capacity; one incinerator would be installed under the project.
(F)    Technical Assistance to BMM for:
(i)    Project implementation including design and construction supervision, including detailed design of
the next phase of the new landfill site, and staffing of a PMU; and (ii) institutional development including:
strengthening the municipal organizational arrangements for solid waste management through
implementation of an Action Plan to: (a) increase transparency in financing, expose the solid waste
management service to competition, and become more accountable and responsive to citizens' needs; (b)
creation of a regulatory body within the municipality for overseeing solid waste services; and (c) creation of
a municipal operational corporation to take on solid waste services.
3.4 Revised Components:
There were no major changes or restructuring in the project during implementation. However, the Bank
and the Borrowers agreed to the following changes within the original components:   In the sewerage
component, it was decided to exclude the second phase of the wastewater treatment plants from the Bank
loan and an amount of US$20 million equivalent was cancelled. In the solid waste component: (i) since
municipal waste collection services were contracted out to a private contractor, the purchase of collection
vehicles was excluded from the project and the amount reallocated to purchase of additional equipment for
the new landfill site; and (ii) the waste transfer station and clinical incinerators were excluded from the
project and the funds reallocated to construction of a sorting station/recycling plant, installation of air
quality monitoring equipment, design and construction of a leachate treatment plant, and digitization of
cadastral maps.
Assessment of Project Design and Components: Project design correctly identified and addressed the main
constraints to improvement and further development of the water supply, sewerage, stormwater and solid
waste systems. The Bursa project was the Bank's seventh operation in the water and sanitation sector in
Turkey and drew upon the lessons from the earlier projects, particularly the need for institutional
strengthening of the water and wastewater utility through greater autonomy and commercialization.
Although there were growing doubts within the Bank as to the effectiveness of twinning-type technical
assistance arrangements, the jury was still out at the time, and the Bank agreed to accept this instrument of
institutional development. In retrospect, the Bank's cumulative experience has by now shown that this type
of arrangement has generally not been successful. A provision had also been made under the Bank loan to
explore the possibilities for contracting out BUSKI' services, in part or in whole, to a private operator.
For the solid waste services, institutional strengthening was to include creation of an operational
corporation to take over the provision of the services, with the possibility of contracting out services to
private contractors, and a regulatory body within the municipality to establish policies and ensure
compliance.

Project components were well designed and defined to achieve the specific physical and institutional
objectives to which they were related. However, greater attention could have been paid to developing, from
the outset, a project monitoring and evaluation system that would have permitted progressive monitoring of
achievement of the larger impacts expected from the project, e.g. the reduction in pollution from the Nilufer
River to help reclassify its water quality status from Class IV to Class III; the reduction in pollution in the
Sea of Marmara; the extension of coverage and improvement of service to the lower-income sections; the
reduction in water-bome disease in the area; and the number of new customers and areas served.
3.5 Qualitv at Entiy:
The project objectives were consistent with the Government's priorities and with the Bank's overall and
sector assistance strategies for Turkey. The project appropriately took into account the Bank's safeguard
policies applicable at the time. Quality at entry was satisfactory in terms of technical evaluation of the
components of the project. Appraisal was based on an advanced status of preparation in regard to
availability of final designs and land acquisition although there were some exceptions as in the case of the
KI open channel interceptor which was later abandoned on account of the presence of illegal settlements.
Quality at entry was also satisfactory for the institutional strengthening components based on the Bank's
approach and experience in the water and sanitation sector at the time although it is clear that, judged by
current standards, the appropriateness of a twinning-type of arrangement would be seriously questioned
given the Bank's cumulative experience on this matter. In the case of the wastewater investments, the
analysis at appraisal did not include a separate financial and economic evaluation of the extension of the
treatment process to the secondary stage whereas the Bank's experience has shown that such investments
may not necessarily be viable, and need to be carefully examined on a case by case basis.
The main risks to project implementation and achievement of objectives were appropriately identified as
those arising from (i) the institutional weaknesses of the Borrowers and (ii) the willingness and ability of
the local authorities to enable the necessary resource mobilization and cost-recovery for the utilities. The
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) also identified the risk to institutional performance posed by the central
government's regulations concerning the personnel regime but no specific safeguards were introduced in the
case of the project. Experience proved that these constraints continued to adversely affect both BUSKI and
BMM operations, and were one of the contributing causes to abandoning of the twinning contract for
BUSKI.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Ozutco,ne/achieveinent of objective:
The overall outcome is assessed as satisfactory since the project has largely met its main physical, and to a
modest extent, its institutional objectives. Although quantification of the project's larger expected impacts
(e.g. reduction of pollution in the Nilufer River; reduction of pollution in the Sea of Marmara; extension of
services to lower income groups; reduction in water-borne diseases) is rendered difficult by the weaknesses
in the project monitoring and evaluation system, the degree of achievement (and in many cases,
over-achievement) of the physical targets and the modest improvements in institutional performance in
BUSKI and BMM provide substantial assurance that the larger impacts have been positive. Thus, the
objective of improvement in environmental conditions and reduction of health hazards in Greater Bursa has
likely been achieved with completion and putting into operation of the targeted: (i) collection systems and
networks; (ii) wastewater treatment plants where an estimated 80 percent of the wastewater now receives
pre-treatment in anaerobic ponds; (iii) stormwater drainage rehabilitation works; (iv) improved solid waste
collection and disposal services, including the closing of the old unregulated disposal site commissioning of
- 5 -



the new landfill site, and introducing recycling; and (v) installation of an air quality monitoring system.
The objective of improvement in institutional arrangements regarding the management of municipal water
supply, sewer services, and domestic and hazardous waste services has been met to a more modest extent
than expected. Although the envisaged twinning contract for BUSKI did not succeed, BUSKI nevertheless
was able to make significant progress on its own, including satisfactory performance in the project's
physical implementation, where most physical targets were met or exceeded, worker productivity per
connection increased, and in meeting its financial obligations under the project, including self-financing of
part of the investment program.  To improve the organizational arrangements for solid waste services,
BMM contracted out the waste collection and landfill operation services to private contractors, and these
are operating satisfactorily. The objective of meeting the demand for water supply, sewerage, flood
protection and solid waste services, including the demand from the poor living on the fringes of the city has
also been met with the very significant extension in the number of water and sewerage connections (where
the actual achievements substantially exceeded targets); the achievement of the targeted stormwater
rehabilitation works; and the expansion of solid waste services. However, given the weaknesses of the
monitoring and evaluation system, it is difficult to quantify the extent to which services have been extended
to low-income and previously under-served groups. The objective of postponing the need to develop new
water resources by improving the efficiency of water usage and reducing the volume of non-revenue water
has been achieved since the share of non-revenue water has been reduced, albeit more slowly than expected,
to the targeted levels. Finally, the objective of implementation of appropriate cost recovery policies has
been met since BUSKI has successfully maintained tariffs at levels sufficient to meet its financial
obligations, including project financing, and BMM has maintained the share of solid waste expenditures in
its total expenditures.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Details of outputs by components are given in Annex 8 and summarized in this section. In water supply,
most physical targets were met or exceeded including rehabilitation of springs, rehabilitation of existing
networks, construction of new wells, and construction of transmission mains. In the case of distribution
reservoirs against the planned target capacity of 30,000m3, a total capacity of 52,500m3 has been
completed, of which 30,000m3 were constructed by the DSI and the remaining 22,500m3 constructed by
BUSKI. In addition to the above capacity, a reservoir with a capacity of 3,500m3 is under construction,
and two other reservoirs have been designed, each having a capacity of 30,000m3, to be constructed in
2002 and 2003. In sewerage, the construction of collectors and extension of the network exceeded the
planned targets. As regards wastewater treatment, while the two wastewater treatment plants in East and
West Bursa were constructed, the facilities installed are restricted to Phase 1 of the planned investment,
covering pre-treatment and anaerobic ponds. At BUSKI's request, Phase 2 of the construction, involving
extension to secondary treatment has been postponed and will now be covered under a new operation being
financed by the European Investment Bank (EIB). In stormwater drainage, targets were met in
rehabilitation of existing networks and in extension of the collection system, but construction of the three
planned open channel interceptors was postponed. In the case of one (KI), it was discovered during
detailed design that illegal settlements would prevent construction. The other two are expected to be
covered under the EIB operation. In regard to technical assistance for BUSKI, intemational consultants
were utilized for design and construction supervision until 1995. Thereafter, with the exception of the
sewage treatment plant, design was undertaken by local institutes and construction supervision by BUSKI
staff. The survey, investigations and mapping studies were carried out as envisaged. For institutional
development, BUSKI entered into a twinning contract with a UK consortium in March 1994, but
discontinued the contract in early 1995 (discussed later in Section 4.5 below). As a result, BUSKI could
achieve only to a limited extent the improvements that were to have been introduced with the help of the
twinning agency. The feasibility study for contracting out services to a private operator was carried out in
- 6 -



1995 and the selection process for a private operator was started, but later abandoned (as discussed in
Section 5.3 below).
In solid waste, rehabilitation of the existing unregulated disposal area was carried out as envisaged.
BMM also contracted with a private contractor to build and operate a plant to produce electric power
utilizing the methane gas from the landfill. The new landfill was developed as envisaged and its operation
has been contracted to a private contractor. Since BMM contracted out solid waste collection services to
private contractors, the planned purchase of collection vehicles was not undertaken, and the funds were
reallocated to purchase additional equipment for the new landfill site. BMM decided not to construct the
new waste transfer station since the district municipalities privatized the collection services and, under the
new arrangements, it was not considered necessary to have the transfer station. BMM also decided not to
proceed with the clinical incinerators because of delays in starting work by the contractor and impending
changes in the relevant national-level environmental guidelines. The funds allocated for these purposes were
re-allocated to other solid waste related needs including a new sorting/recycling plant, air quality
monitoring equipment, a new leachate treatment plant, and digitization of cadastral maps. These have been
completed with the exception of the leachate treatment plant where designs have been completed but the
construction is expected to be taken up under a new EIB-financed project. Technical assistancefor BMM
was provided as planned for design and construction supervision but the institutional development
assistance was suspended after the termination of the twinning contract.
4.3 Net Present Value/Econoinic rate of return:
At appraisal, the economic rate of return (ERR) on the water and sewerage investments (excluding
stormwater and solid waste investments, the benefits of which were judged to be unquantifiable) was
estimated at 8.2 percent using the incremental water and sewerage revenues as a proxy for the benefits
attributable to the investments. This did not include the unquantifiable health, environmental and social
benefits of these investments. The re-estimated ERR for the project is 9 percent (details in Annex 3).  As
at appraisal, this does not take into account the unquantifiable benefits mentioned earlier.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
A financial rate of return was not estimated at appraisal, and has not been estimated for the ICR.
4 5 Institutionail development imnpact:
The project's institutional development impact has been modest. In the case of BUSKI, the institutional
strengthening was expected to be achieved through the twinning contract with a reputable water and
sewerage utility operator. The contract was signed in March 1994 but, from the outset, there were
interaction problems between BUSKI and the consultant due to the lack of counterpart staff who could
speak English. The situation was worsened by the hiring freeze imposed by the central government in
public and municipal enterprises. In early 1995, BUSKI and the City Council decided to terminate the
twinning contract and to pursue instead the possibility of contracting out operations to a private operator
which itself was deferred in 2000 to beyond the completion of the project. With the discontinuation of the
twinning arrangement and the non-realization of the private operator alternative, the expected institutional
strengthening outputs did not develop as planned, particularly in regard to training of BUSKI staff and
management, and development of asset management and management information systems. Nevertheless,
BUSKI was able to make creditable progress in regard to other important aspects, notably in improving
worker productivity per connection, reducing the ratio of non-revenue water (and unaccounted-for-water or
UFW) to water production, improving the bill collection ratio, and satisfactorily meeting its financial
obligations, including project financing requirements and debt service. With the contracting out of waste
- 7-



collection and landfill operation services to private contractors, BMM made a major organizational
improvement in its solid waste department.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Construction of civil works, particularly for the sewage treatment plants, was affected by the financial
difficulties of the local contractors which were beyond the control of the Government or implementing
agency.
5.2 Factors genierally subject to government control:
Although not entirely within the control of the Government, the macroeconomic conditions deteriorated in
the early part of the implementation of the project, leading to high rates of inflation and devaluation of the
local currency. This affected the project in two ways - (i) the constant pressure to increase tariffs to
compensate for rising costs, and (ii) constraints in hiring personnel due to the austerity measures and hiring
freezes in public and municipal enterprises.
5,3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency conitrol:
BUSKI and BMM, overall, carried out the project well in terms of meeting most physical targets and
achieving some institutional improvements, but the performance could have been enhanced further with
timely addressing of certain shortcomings.
Stajjing of PMU: In BUSKI, there were initial delays in adequate staffing of the PMU but these were
resolved after a qualified consultant was hired to function as the head of the PMU. Although the
abandonment of the twinning contract was at least to some extent due to external constraints in hiring
appropriate counterpart personnel, a more proactive approach on the part of BUSKI may have helped to
resolve the issue.
Twinning/Privatization: Similarly, while hiring of a private operator was not a requirement under the
project, once BUSKI and the City Council decided in 1995 to pursue the possibility, they could have
shown greater commitment to bringing it to fruition. In the event, even after five years, a decision had not
been taken on whether to proceed with inviting bids from the pre-qualified firms.
Use of Technical Assistance: BUSKI also did not fully utilize the possibilities for other technical
assistance provided under the project, including for design and construction supervision, which contributed
to implementation delays in some components. For example, in the case of the sewage treatment plants,
BUSKI wished to utilize local consultants and its own staff for design and construction supervision, but
was persuaded by the Bank, after an extensive discussion, to engage qualified consultants with the
appropriate experience.
Operational Improvements: While BUSKI made notable progress in improving operating and financial
efficiency, including worker productivity, tariff adequacy, and effective bill collection, it was relatively
slow in coming to grips with the issue of the high level of non-revenue water (including UFW). Indicators
in this respect actually deteriorated in the early years of project implementation, but starting in 1996,
BUSKI made a concerted effort to address the issue, which led to sustained improvements. Consequently,
BUSKI was able to meet the stipulated targets since 1998. Over the course of implementation, BUSKI has
been able to reduce the level of non-revenue water from 63 percent in 1993 to an estimated 45 percent in
- 8 -



2000, thus meeting the target level of 47 percent. BUSKI has further reported that, in September 2001,
UFW was decreased to about 35 percent, and the estimate for 2001 as a whole is 38 percent. BUSKI
attributes the sharp decline in UFW to the rehabilitation work which started recently in the very old
networks in the older districts of Bursa where the population is very dense. Nevertheless, further progress is
needed in this area.
5.4 Costs anldfinanicing:
Costs: Total project cost up to completion of the project is now estimated at US$193.2 million compared
to the appraisal estimate of US$258.3 million. Out of a difference of about US$65 million, US$55 million
is on account of the postponement of the second phase of BUSKI's wastewater treatment plants (which will
now be taken up under an EIB-financed project). Areas where total costs were lower than anticipated were
in technical assistance for BUSKI (by US$11 million) reflecting in part the discontinuance of the twinning
contract; stornwater works (by about US$5 million) due to the postponement of the three open channel
interceptors; sewerage civil works (by US$5 million); and solid waste equipment (by US$7 million) due to
the changes in the description of the project. Costs were higher than projected in water supply civil works
(by US$8.4 million) and in land acquisition by BUSKI (by US$6.6 million).
Financing: The final amount of the Bank loan to BUSKI is US$93.3 million (after cancellation of US$20
million at BUSKI's request in 1998). The final amount of the Bank loan to BMM was US$10.7 million
after cancellation of an amount of US$1.8 million at BMM's request in 2001. The BUSKI component of
the project (US$174.8 million) was financed by the Bank loan of US$93.3 million and a BUSKI
contribution of US$81.5 million. The BMM component of the project (US$16.2 million) was financed by
the Bank loan of US$10.7 million and a BMM contribution of US$5.5 million.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationtale for sustainability rating:
The project components are likely to be sustainable. BUSKI is one of the better managed municipal water
and sewerage utilities in Turkey. Under the project, it has demonstrated the ability to implement major
investments successfully, and to achieve significant improvements in operating and financial performance.
The achievements under the project are likely to be sustained through the successor project that is being
financed by the EIB. The EIB project will include those parts of the Bank project that were postponed,
(e.g. the second phase of the wastewater treatment plants, open channel interceptors and the leachate
treatment plant) while continuing the institutional development initiated under the Bank project. BMM has
made substantial organizational improvements in its solid waste operations where collection and landfill
operations have been contracted out to private contractors. These arrangements are working successfully
and are expected to be sustainable.
6.2 Transition arrangemnent to regutlar operations:
The project investments were implemented by the existing operating entities and are subsumed into their
regular, ongoing operations. Consequently, no special transition arrangements are required.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Bank performance was satisfactory in the lending phase. During project identification and preparation, the
Bank was substantially involved in assisting the Borrowers in the design and implementation of the project.
- 9-



The Bank's safeguard policies in effect at the time were appropriately taken into account. In hindsight, the
Bank's support for a twinning-type technical assistance contract may now be questioned, given the evidence
that is currently available Bank-wide in regard to the relative inefficacy of this kind of arrangement.
However, at the time the project was designed, the Bank's position in this regard was by no means clear and
the jury was still out as to the desirability or otherwise of twinning or other technical assistance
arrangements. As discussed earlier (Section 3.4), one area where the Bank could have done more during
preparation was in ensuring that the project monitoring and evaluation system would enable evaluation of
the larger impacts that were being pursued under the project.
7.2 Su7pervision:
Bank performance was satisfactory during the supervision phase. The Bank carried out a total of 12
missions in the field, usually staffed by a sanitary engineer and a financial analyst. Barring changes due to
retirement of Bank staff, there was continuity in the staff assigned to supervision. Starting in 1998,
supervision was carried out entirely by staff stationed in the Bank's field office in Ankara which also
promoted more frequent interaction between the Borrowers and the Bank. The Bank was responsive and
flexible in making adjustments within components where justified by changing circumstances, e.g.
introduction of the air quality monitoring system, sorting station/recycling plant under the solid waste
component. The Bank was also persistent in its monitoring and follow-up of BUSKI's progress in
maintaining adequacy of tariffs and in improvement in the ratio of non-revenue water to water produced.
In regard to pursuing the objective of institutional development, in retrospect, it could be questioned
whether the Bank was sufficiently energetic and persuasive in getting BUSKI and the City Council to adopt
the private operator option. Given the larger benefits of private sector involvement, the Bank could
possibly have pursued this option more when the twinning arrangement stopped. To introduce the private
sector, the City Council would have had to pass a resolution which was politically difficult. Also, while the
Bank was diligent in its supervision of project progress in terms of the specific physical and institutional
components, an area where greater attention could have been paid was in the setting up of suitable
arrangements for evaluating the broader, overall impacts of the project (as discussed in Section 3.4).
7.3 Overall Bank peiforinance:
The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory, although it could have been enhanced in some aspects
as discussed above.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The performance of the two Borrowers, BUSKI and BMM, was satisfactory during preparation. Both
Borrowers collaborated well with Bank staff in project design and development.
7.5 Government implementationi peiforinance:
The Central Government had a limited role in the project with no participation in project financing and
implementation. Its performance was satisfactory.
7.6 Inipleinentting Agency:
The performance of both implementing agencies, BUSKI and BMM, was satisfactory although it could
have been enhanced in some respects as discussed above.
- 10 -



7. 7 Overall Borrowerperformance:
On balance, the overall Borrower performance is rated as satisfactory although it could have been enhanced
in some respects as discussed above.
8. Lessons Learned
The main lessons learned from the design and implementation of the project are the following:
(i)    Particular care needs to be given to the design and implementation of technical assistance
arrangements for institutional strengthening. In the case of the project, the growing doubts within the Bank
in regard to the efficacy of twinning-type technical assistance contracts warranted that special attention
should have been given during project preparation to establishing Borrower commitment and anticipating
possible disruptive factors such as the lack of appropriate counterpart staff;
(ii)    The Bank needs to stay focussed on institutional development objectives; once it is clear that the
planned arrangements are not likely to be successful, as in the case of the twinning contract, the Bank
should pursue altemative options, e.g. the engagement of a private operator, with conviction and vigor;
(iii)   The Bank needs to be mindful of the broader objectives and impacts of the project when helping the
Borrowers to set up monitoring and evaluation systems; in the case of the project, while physical and
institutional progress indicators were well developed, the system did not provide for evaluating progress in
achieving the larger objectives;
(iv)    A high degree of Borrower commitment and a well-defined action program are necessary for a
successful program of reduction in non-revenue and unaccounted-for-water; progress in the case of BUSKI
became evident only after persistent efforts at addressing the problem; and
(v)    Special attention needs to be given to establishing the technical and financial viability of local civil
works contractors; in the case of BUSKI, local contractors' financial difficulties led to significant delays in
major components, e.g. the sewage treatment plants.

Based on our version of ie ICR Report and the comments we have genemutd now, the Bank

diligently the detection and cogtiol of both physical aod ommerc  bsses.
I     T- .e specid atention requircd for checking of local cil conotors is overstated. It is

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
At appraisal, an ERR was calculated for the water supply and sewerage part of the project using the
incremental water and sewerage revenues as a proxy for the benefits attributable to the investments. The
average selling price applicable in the first year that the project became operational was taken as a
conservative proxy for benefits on the assumption that most consumers would be willing to pay more than
this for essential water supplies. Capital costs (net of taxes) used in the calculation were limited to those
for the investments in water supply and sewerage (excluding stormwater). On this basis, the ERR was
estimated at 8.2 percent. The SAR indicated that the project economic benefits would be higher than
indicated by the ERR if the unquantifiable health, environmental and social benefits of the project were
taken into account.
For the ICR, the re-estimated ERR is 9 percent excluding the unquantifiable benefits mentioned above.
The ERR is higher than estimated at appraisal since the project capital costs do not include those for the
second stage of the wastewater treatment plants which was postponed to beyond the project. Exclusion of
the second stage wastewater investments increases the ERR as estimated on the above basis.
In addition, there were important, though unquantifiable, environmental, health and social benefits from the
solid waste component.

Additional Annex 8. Project Output by Components
Water Supply
Rehabilitation of existing springs: The rehabilitation work and construction of transmission lines to the
related distribution reservoirs is almost completed. Against the target of 35 km, about 56 km of pipe have
been laid. As a result of the rehabilitation, the yield from the springs is measured about 28 mm3 per year as
compared to the estimated 12.7 mm3 prior to the rehabilitation.
Rehabilitation and improvement of existing networks: A total of about 1,585 km of pipes were installed
under the project. In addition, BUSKI laid an additional 680 km from internal sources resulting in about
2,265 km of pipes being installed under the rehabilitation program.
Construction of new wells: Against the target of 10 new wells, 12 wells were drilled and equipped with 12
submerged pumps. A new pump station was built and four horizontal centrifugal pumps were installed for
seasonal use when the spring and Doburca water supplies decrease. An additional 61 mm3 of water is
available annually as a result of the new wells and pumping station.
Construction of new distribution reservoir capacity of 30,000 m3: Against the appraisal target capacity
of 30,000 m3, a total of 52,500 m3 of capacity has been constructed, of which 30,000 m3 were constructed
by DSI and the remaining 22,500 m3 by BUSKI. In addition, a reservoir with capacity of 3,500 m3 is
under construction, and two other reservoirs with a capacity of 30,000 m3 are planned for 2002 and 2003.
Construction of main transmission lines and extension of the existing network: Against the target of 70
km, 89 km of transmission lines have already been laid and another 10 km are in progress.
Meters: About 230,500 meters were procured under the project of which about 223,500 have been
installed; the remaining 7,000 are expected to be installed by end of 2001.
Sewerage
Extension of the existing sewerage network: About 1,067 km of collectors and new sewers were
completed, of which about 353 km was constructed under the project and the remaining 713 km by BUSKI
from internal funds.
Construction of wastewater treatment plants in East and West Bursa: The wastewater treatment plants
were to have been constructed in two phases - pre-treatment and anaerobic ponds in the first phase, and
secondary and biological treatment in the second. Phase I has been completed for both plants which are in
operation. BUSKI decided to postpone Phase 2 and the part of the Bank loan allocated for the purpose was
cancelled. Phase 2, involving biological treatment, will now be taken up under a project being financed by
the EIB.

Stormwater Drainage
Rehabilitation of existing stormwater drainage: About 172 km of stormwater drainage sewers, ranging
from 200 mm to 1,600 mm diameter, were constructed under the project; BUSKI constructed another 15
km from its internal sources.
Construction of three open channel interceptors: Construction of all three interceptors has been delayed.
During detailed design, it was found that construction of one of the interceptors would not be feasible on
account of illegal settlements. BUSKI expects that the other two interceptors will be financed under the
EIB loan.
Extension of collection system: Against the target of 14 km, about 17 km of box culverts were
constructed.
Technical Assistance for BUSKI
Detailed design and construction supervision: An international consultant employed for design and
preparation of the bidding documents also helped with the supervision of the construction contract up to
1995. Thereafter, BUSKI staff carried out construction supervision work except for the wastewater
treatment facilities. A local consultant was engaged for preparation of the water supply network designs.
Detailed designs for sewerage and stormwater drainage works were included within the contracts for the
construction. Detailed design for 170 km of sewerage lines, and for design and preparation of the
biological treatment works were completed under the project.
Survey, investigations and mapping of the water supply system: The work was undertaken under three
consultancy contracts. Findings and results were utilized in development of BUSKI's GIS system, and for
new design and rehabilitation of the network.
Institutional strengthening through twinning:  BUSKI entered into a twinning agreement with a UK
consortium in March 1994. In August 1994, the consultant prepared an inception report. Interaction
between BUSKI and the consultant were hampered by the lack of counterpart staff in BUSKI who could
speak English. In late 1994, under a program of austerity measures introduced by the Government to deal
with a deteriorating macroeconomic situation, hiring freezes were placed on public and municipal
enterprises. Due to the continuing difficulty in providing counterpart staff, BUSKI terminated the twinning
contract in early 1995. Instead, BUSKI and the City Council initiated exploration of the possibility of
engaging a private operator to take over BUSKI operations. An international consultant, financed under
the project, recommended an 'affermage' type of contract for BUSKI. Nine consortia were pre-qualified for
inviting of proposals. However, the process was delayed, first due to municipal elections in Bursa and later
due to the problems encountered by the contracting parties in similar contracts elsewhere in Turkey. In
2000, the Bank and BUSKI decided that it would no longer be possible to include this component for
financing under the loan since it could not be completed prior to loan closing.
Training program for BUSKI management and staff: This was expected to be developed with the help of,
first the twinning agency and later, the private operator. Since this did not occur, BUSKI pursued the
training on its own through a combination of in-house and external training through the Uludag University.
Training activities were included under the consultant's contracts for surveys, investigation and mapping.
Some training in financial management was provided by the auditors.

Program for increasing the volume of water billed: Starting in 1992, BUSKI engaged private local
contractors to carry out meter-reading, identify illegal connections, distribute bills, and install and maintain
meters. Under the project, BUSKI also strengthened its computer hardware and software related to
customer service and relations.
Asset and capital investment management system: BUSKI was unable to introduce this since it was
expected to be developed with the help of the twinning agency or private operator. BUSKI expects to
pursue this under the EIB-financed project.
Management information system: For the same reasons as the item above, BUSKI has not been able to
install a fully developed MIS. Some improvements were made in the context of the results and information
provided by other work such as the survey, investigations and mapping studies. Integration is needed with
BUSKI's GIS system. These will be pursued under the EIB-financed project.
New water and sewerage tariff schedule: BUSKI was successful in introducing a tariff adjustment system
based on monthly indexation of tariffs to account for inflation. However, a more comprehensive review of
the tariff structure and schedule, particularly with a view to influencing water demand management, was
not undertaken.
Feasibility study for contracting out services to a private operator: This was carried out in 1995 by an
intemational consultant who recommended an "affermage" type of arrangement for BUSKI. Progress in
selecting an operator was delayed, and eventually, deferred for the reasons explained earlier above.
Solid Waste
Rehabilitation of the existing unregulated disposal site: The existing disposal site was rehabilitated as
envisaged and works completed for fire control, construction of 51 gas wells, drainage channels for
leachate control, capping with impermeability layers, collection ditches, planting and erosion control. In
addition, under a concession contract to a private contractor, a plant has been set up, and is in operation,
to utilize the methane gas from the dumpsite to produce electric power.
Development of a new landfill site: A new sanitary landfill has been constructed in two stages. In the first
stage, landfill construction was completed in the X and T Valleys, including access road, bridge, site
excavation and clearance, impermneability layers, drainage pipes, administration building and a small
treatment plant. In the second stage, the Main Valley landfill construction was completed.
Solid waste transfer station: In July 2000, BMM and the Bank agreed to exclude the transfer station from
the project and to include instead a sorting station/recycling plant. The latter has been completed and is in
operation. Extension of the recycling plant has been deferred due to BMM's budgetary constraints.
Collection vehicles: Collection of municipal waste has been contracted out to private contractors. BMM
and the Bank agreed to reallocate the funds to purchase of other essential equipment for operation and
maintenance of the landfill site including a compactor, motorgrader, backhoe excavator, loader, and
bulldozer.
Clinical incinerators: In July 2000, BMM and the Bank agreed to exclude these items from the project
because of initial delays on the part of the contractor and subsequent changes in applicable national-level
environmental guidelines.
- 38 -



Additional investments included during implementation: BMM and the Bank agreed to the inclusion of:
(i) an air quality monitoring system under the project. Four monitoring stations (two at the landfills and
two in the city) have been set up to monitor and analyze data in regard to SO, CO, NO, PM, HC and O .
The stations are in operation; and (ii) design and construction of a leachate treatment plant. Designs have
been completed but construction has been postponed due to BMM's budgetary constraints. The plant is
now expected to be financed under the EIB project.
Technical Assistance for BMM
Design and construction supervision: This was carried out as planned for the unregulated disposal site
rehabilitation, new landfill sites, and waste management works.
Institutional strengthening of BMM's solid waste organization: Action plans were to be developed for
waste collection and transfer, clinical waste and industrial waste. By a special arrangement, BMM has
transferred the waste collection and transfer responsibility entirely to the District Municipalities which have
entered into contracts with private operators. BMM has also contracted a private operator for the landfill
operations. In addition, BMM has entered into a contract with a private operator to set up a plant for
producing electricity from the methane gas from the landfill. The plant is in operation. Improvements have
been made in clinical waste collection, including through purchase of special-purpose trucks, but the
planned new incinerators have been delayed pending changes in national environmental guideline. To
expand the base and to improve the collection of the cleaning tax, BMM has integrated the cadastral and
planning information to the Bursa geographical information system together with BUSKI.

Note: BUSKI's 1991-2000 financial statements are audited by independent external auditors.
The US$ figures are calculated taking the yearly average exchange rates for 1991-1998.
The year end exchange rate for 2000 is used for calculation for the years 1999 and 2000.
1999-2000 financial statements are prepared in accordance with IAS 29 (Financial Reporting for Hyperinflationary
Economies). IAS 29 requires that financial statements prepared in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy be
stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date and the corresponding figures for previous
periods be restated in the same terms. The financial statements of prior years, including monetary assets and
liabilities reported therein, which were previously reported in terms of the measuring units current at the end of
those years are stated in their entiTety to the measuring unit current at December 31, 2000.
All items in the statements of income are restated by applying the relevant (monthly or yearly average) conversion
factors.

In the above tabe the cost for the X valley appears high redtive to the costs of the T
and Main Valleys, because the conruction of the X-vaJley included the following additiond
works wich serve the whole landfilt:
-  consftuction of a acess road to the landfil ad intnal site roads;
-  geomane liers were puhased to be used fbr both the X and T Valleys;
-  consaucto of the adninisaton building, the laboratwy snd the waste rcption
facilities ( weigbbridge and other accessories);
-  drainge piping for the whole area and
-  overall fenci  and site prop8rtios.

OVERALL ASS! SMENT OF PROJECT IMPLERMENTATlON
AlD realised works, as explained above, show the success in reaching the pro*ect
targets. The subprojects, that couldn't be realised, thoug thyw were in the scope of the
project, are the transfer ston and th meiinerator for clinical wastes. Waste Transer Staion
was cancelled , because the construction was not feasible. Instead of tbese componerts, other
prcTS were r oied The constucion of the incinerator was co _tacted to a fin  This firm
has gwe bnupt so thc coutract was cancelled. In place of the incineratr we had agreed
with the Bank to consruct a btatment plant for leacae waterMufartunately this c wnta
could not be signed even after tendering, because the financial crisis in February 2001
required  endering, for which there was not enough time left befove th loan closm
Bursa Metropolitan Municipality showed good performance durig the Project
implementaion as far as preprig tender documents and tcdering vwaou  for vaious
oontracs. We have learned all the intricacies for use of an inernational loan. We have
aoompished very important improvements in waste management for Bursa. Dispos of
solid wastes is a big problem especially for great cites; thus, such an integral poJect ud
conesuction of now landfills has been very beneficial for Bursa.
The were also some difficulties in using a loan. Such troubles originated at times
frm the Municipality and at tines from the World Bank. We considr that the use of uch
loans wod be better if in the fiLzue a swante unit would be extmblishd to mn   the
Projet implementation. Tho unit, that prepar  the tender ad the teams of efernand  the
unitha realises the contract were different. Normrally the wbole work should be dont by one
and e same unit. Besides tis, if some evaluation were done quiker by the World Bank, it
would be easner to proceed with tie works, as desired.
Eesides these, tbe people responsible for the Project should receive special trining
fiom the Bank. Such persons should be informed about the aims of loan, how to use it, and
how the terms of references should be prepared. Such information would solve many
prnbles. One problem, was that the rated people changed severd times due to the kng
Project implernentation.
In sumnury, the old waste dumpsite which had been serving the city for nearly 30
yesrs, has been rehabili1td into recreational park tD be opened to public use in the fice
Te landfill gas collction system was contracted through a BOT for oner  genration, as the
fit example of its kind in Turkey. The new lasl developed hs ben pu to ue for abot 6
years nd expected to srve until 2020. Along with the pnivate operaton amn _etea the site
has become an example and aspiration for many municipalities. Tle GIS system, which wa a
byplrudut yf the Piruect, also has significat instiuioa hpact both in Bursa again for may
odhr municipalities, as an importat step for institutional effectivess and oost recovery.

2. APRAISAL OF BllSKI PERFPORMANCE
BUSKI has been xceptionally successful during project implementation as will be demonstrated
below:
2.1. BUSKI has successfuly implemented a tariff adjustment system based on the consumer price
index (CPI). The adjusnts were initially quarterly, and monthly, since  1994.
Implementation continued through 3 municipal terms, inspite of 3 polidcally different terms.
Politically, all 3 mayors have explained to the Burs citizens, the necessity to maintain the
highe tariffs in the country at a place believed to have abundant waten fiom the mountain
and which requires minimal Uratment and pumping costs.
2.2. The Project SAR had projected for tariff levels at 1 $/n' or more. BUSKI tariffs varied fom
the lowest 0.47 Ym3 upto 0.85 trme. This may appear as one BUSKI devixtion; however, as
we shall elaborate. LWter in Item 7, the impact of this deviation has not been significant
because of other difficultes enoountered duiing imple_mtationm.
2.3. BUSKI had a mininul wastewater teatment target, permitting the majority of the funds to be
used for improvement of the networks. BUSRI has, by a smar decision, concentrated on
water supply rehabilitations and expansions to improve cost recovery measures.
2.4. Realizing the importance of raising adequate intenal funds, BUSKM  has taken drasic
meaures for improvement of her billing and collection performances.
a. engged a private sector for meter reading, billing and invoicing, as well as private sCevice
cutoffs and reconnections to reduce delinquent payments.
b. enaged the private sector to develop special software to update cusomer records and
reltd affairs.
c. periodically invested substantidal sums in hardwarc and software to upgrade the customer
databae.
d. th metw reading frequency was increased fiom quarterly to bimonthly and monthly to
speed up the colletions and prevent inflationary erosion Further improvements (like
reduced meter readers) were realized using hand computers and mobile pnnters.
e. all meters are rnewed and standardized over a 2 year period to imprve metering
accuracy and reduce unaccounted4br-water(UFW).
f. BUSKI has engagd private sector to melt away the backlog of denwnds for semces,
historically performed by the public service agencies, such its metr replacements and new
of new water nd sewerage connections.

2M5. For institutional impmvement, BUSKI requested Baik's agreement/approval For supeRision
of the infiastruature constuction works. To faciliatte this process
a. the network operafionl resposbilities are consolidated in a new operations department,
b. the water and serage department concentrated on the supervision ftnctions;
a and to overcome the lega restrictions for employment of now staff BUSKI ha5
outsourced from a tnunicipal commercial corporation.
l. Armngeents were made for training of the staff internally and externally tbrough the
local university. BUSKJ has permitted  taff to pursue masters proganumes at the local
univesity.
2:6. BUSKi Management has decided to cancel a potion of the loan, realizing that timing for
implemeOtatien of the 2  Stage of the wastewater treamnt plants was delayed beyond the
loan grace period, and improved financial managemt Ths cancellation has relievedi
BUSKI from unnecar arily higb payment instalhments~ pemiitting BUSKI to raiselallooage
mm iftemaJ fwds both as matxig tR4s or for internal in'vestments, This canceUatiQn
requeat was accocpained by a request to eitber split the loan into two tnches to induce a
new grace period for the secod tranebe or to increase the loan disbursement percentage. The
BaEk's agreement to indeew the lon disbursement percentage fromn tbe oiginal 47Y% to 70r/a
during 1998 and 1999 has substantially increas  BUSKI invesments, pamitting3 BUSKI to
complete essmtially atl ageted lavestmetts in a timely man=.
2,7. The downszing of the loan was in line with the original project structtuing, even if BUSKI
had been ale to incrase the tari:ff to the levels specified in the SAR-upto IS and more, it
was not going to be posible to speed the implementation because,
a. Destgns were not available at tebeginning due to the lack of the required maps.
b. People have beea complaining when too many crews are aetive in the streets,
congesting traffic, and thus, fon:ing BUSKI to carry on a more retrained/pacod
consbuction proram <rnote: Bursa, because of the maoar older districts have a lot of
sma  tets and emain amteries)
2.8 Significaat improvement in mananement of UFW was realized in spite of tho high population
growth and the old distibution network (Tab le 4). The comparnson of the UFW S AR targets
wih BVSKI realzaion are shown in Figure I .The UFW has dcreased from the hih of
65P% down to abot 35s by the end of 2001. The sharp drops/improvements in UFW
coed to the rehabilation of the very old networks in the older districts of Bursa started
in 2000. This rehab program is prmo ng aniy stowly due to the very narrow and seep
sueets, where use of consUtion oquipment is diicult. This work is still contituing and is
exqecVed to be completed by 2003. This already has helped to avoid the sumnmer service

2.10. Accounting Improvetenew  BUSKI had been using the public accounting system in the
eariy 1980's. Following introducton of of the uniform chart of acconts BUSKI has steadily
improved her accoumting system uing upto-date hrdware and software through cost-
centered accountn upto inflation accounting for the 2001 acounta Asset inventories and
assessment of the ratd depreciation was also upgraded to commercial levels.
2.11. GIS System . Following the preparation of the digital topographic maps and the
inftsructure maps, an urban GIS system was deveoped for Bursa. Paralle coordinated

3.7-The experienced Bank's Project Task Team has facilitated successfizi implementaions,
providing appropriate flexibility and timely guidance through the project duration.
3.3.The Bank's agreement to increase the disbursement level for a perod of 2 years has
sucessfully accelerated Project implementaion. Probably, a similar or better impact could
have been created if the lomn was strucued i  nches with corresponding staged grce
periods.
4. MAJOR FACTORS SLOWING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.1. External Factors: The financial crises which occurred in 1994 and in late 2000/way 2001,
had significant negative impacts on the Projec. In1994, the drop of the tariffs fiom 0.75
SVm3 down to 0.47, BUSKI had to cancel an ICB tender for procume  of ductilop    due
to the sharp escala  of the achange rates. Not having the pipes, the pipelaying coacts
were also delayed by abot a yea. However, the impact of the 2001 crisis was somewha
limited as Er as the Project inpknntaton unfortuately, it had a signflcant negative
impaa on BUSKI's repayment capacity.
The eartxqake of Auust 1999, fotmatdy, had caused only very minor damages in BUSKI
territory. BUSKI's headquarter building had to undergo a substantial reinforcemen.
4.2. Internal Fctors: Unavailability of topographic and utltity maps in 1993/94, and the lega
restictions for photometnc map productn has delayed designs, at least, by a year in
the early part of the Project.
S. PERFORMANCE IN THEMATIC AREAS
5.L.Poverty Alevistion and other Social Objectives: BUSKI Project was targetng oveall
water and sewerage infrsucture improvements, which impacted all the ciizens in Bursa
posiively with availability of mwro  water and improved water quaiy. Even though direct
benefis to the poor, who mosdy live in the fringes of the city, cannot be easily
measured/determined; it is possible to ste tht BUSMI has been able to improve service on
the mountaineous slopes of Bursa with the rehabilitation of the mounta  springs snd the new
umping stations/reservoirs built in these areas. At the lower peripheral areas, BUSKI has
laid kms of new networks, fbr both water and sewene purposes.
52Environmental  Objectives:  BUSKt  has  realzed  substantial  success  by  the
rehabilitationexpansion of her water supply, sewerage and stomm drainge systems. Acoess to
such services have exceeded 90% levels. The wastewvte treatment torget of 50%/o BOD
removal has been achieved since the commissing of the Fwrst Stage of the two plants in
1998. Now the tendering notice is issued for the Second Stage Wastewater Treatment Plants,
and fnllnwina the comrrxjsaionu in 2004. tratmet levels will rise over 90%.

BUSKI has taken over the responbility fiom Natonat  Water Works Agency (1SI) for
monitoringof industil dischareao the steam flows within the metroltn boundaries.
Already, BUSKI has initiated cooperation with the municiplities in the region, the
Provincial Environmea  Agency and the relevant departmens of the local University to
develop the ncesary fiamework for eflctive enforemen of the national and local wate
managment requiations,
53.Privat Secten Develbp_ent Objetive: BUSKI Management has shown a keen awareness
to poteal benefts fom a wide involvement of the private sector. With backing of the
municipal politicl organizations, BUSKI has engagd the private sector in many new aresF
wher historically only public entites fmntioned. In addition to the usual construc&io
cowbactsg Jnd the desinconsutmncy services, BUSK) vetured into nuny areas as a
pine. Starting with mrter reading in 1992, tw following services wero all privatized:
softwar  development and operaion of the computer catter, fhcility cleanig and office
chore; the tecoffee sal; the personnel arrivaLdepart  trnsporation; and provison of
Uransortatio for supervsiosit visi and for officil travels in and aut of the city. Wor
and sewerag sevice connection, ad mtr rnewals and repairs, followed. Outsourcing
peonndel for constuctwn su;xvision  has grown firth  by employing technical staff
(engineers and technicians) foir the routine "operation and maintenance" needs.
Dring 1996, BUSKi had the feasibility for engagemet of a prvae opeaor for all BUSKI
fiuncons studed. Bas  on the encourgig outome BUSK  General Assembly had
unnimously approved for a managemnot (with affernage flavour) contrac over a 10 year
duratun BtSI had colected the prequaification applicans, but culd not prooeod with
the tendering when the local nd ntional eections were announced in 1997. Following a
nearly total newal of the Genral (municipal) Assembly, the subject has been under
investgatio  and review by the new Assembly. The indicaions are positive for a new
decision to go ahead with a now tendering process. The process is likely to be sarted in late
2001, following a decsw mi November 2001.
6. SUSTAIINABIIU
Susainability of BUSKJ's pwronmanc is cricalUly based on maintaining the tariff levels, so that
debt repayments and opeatnal cost are met, and some finds remain for rehabilitation and
expansion  vestmnts. Overall, BUSKI tariffs prmitted aliocating "a-third" of her revewes to
eah of the above cost conr This proportioning pamtted for comfwtably meetng the revene
neds until the financial crsis in Febuary 2001. BUSKI has been raiing the base tariff levels at
lo/ levels biannualy above the inflatn to catch up with the acoelaaton in the curency
exchae mtes. These aranements claruy reflect BUSI's detemination to maintain the cost
recovery targets.

(biologicaL treatient with nutrient removal) and to compite the deficiencies in water supply,
sewerage and storm dmragn e systems during the 2001-2006 period. The Upgraded Wasteater
