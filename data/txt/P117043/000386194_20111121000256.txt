                   PUBLIC SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

Borrower         Republic of Paraguay
Implementing     Ministry of Finance
Agency
Financing Data   IBRD Loan Amount: US$100 million
Operation type   Stand-alone DPL
Main Policy      The proposed Public Sector Development Policy Loan (PSDPL) is intended to
Areas            support the Government of Paraguay in implementing its reform program to
                 improve the public sector. The loan supports three areas of policy reform:
                  State-Owned Enterprises Oversight;
                  Central Administration Internal Financial Control and Internal Audit;
                  Tax System.
Key Outcome      State-Owned Enterprises Oversight
Indicators        SOEs financial operations are carried out in a transparent manner and are subject
                    to scrutiny by the Government and civil society. Target: online publishing of
                    SOEs audited financial statements.
                  Timely delivery of SOEs audited financial statements. Target: SOEs audited
                    financial statements are available no later than June 30 of the following year.
                  Recovery of 20% of the past-due debt accumulated by Central Administration
                    entities with SOEs. (Baseline 2010: 0% of the certified aggregated amount of
                    debt was reimbursed (Gs.365 billion)).
                  Rate of timely payments reaches 80% for basic services provided to the State by
                    SOEs (Electricity, Telecommunication, Water). (Baseline Jan-Jun 2010: 51%)
                  At least 5 SOEs have established targets that can be monitored on a regular basis
                    by UMEP.
                  The number of hours of power outage as measured by hs/year per user has
                    dropped to 11 hours (Baseline: 2010: 11.2 hs/year per user)
                  The coverage of ESSAP water access as measured by the percentage of
                    households in urban areas with access to water has increased to 89.2% (Baseline
                    January 2010: 79.4%).
                  The percentage of user complaints to ESSAP has decreased to 18% (Baseline
                    2010: 19%).
                  Fixed telephone line installation time has decreased to 17 days (Baseline 2010: 20
                    days).
                 Central Administration Internal Financial Control
                  PEFA Indicators for internal control and internal audit (PI-20 and PI-21) for 50%
                    of the ministries are rated C, which shows: (i) A more comprehensive set of
                    internal control rules, and (ii) A broader coverage and quality of internal audit
                    function and a higher extent of management response to internal audit findings.
                    (Baseline: 2008 Integrated Fiduciary Assessment rating for PI-20 and PI-21: D+)
                 Tax System
                  Tax-to-GDP ratio is at least 13.8%. (Baseline 2010:13.4%)
                  Ratio of audits of large tax payers that result in additional assessment exceeds
                    70%. (Baseline 2010: 55%)
Program          The overall development objective of the proposed PSDPL is to contribute to

                                                 v
Development       the effectiveness and efficiency of the public sector. This is expected to be
Objective(s)      reached via the following specific objectives: (i) exerting effective Oversight of
and               SOEs; (ii) improving Central Administration’s internal financial control; and
Contribution to   (iii) strengthening the Tax System.
CPS               Contribution to the CPS: The proposed DPL is fully consistent with the current
                  World Bank Group CPS (2009-2013): two out of the three cross-cutting themes
                  addressed by the CPS program – governance, poverty reduction, and equitable
                  growth – are supported by the PSDPL.
Risks and Risk    There are three significant risks to the program supported by the PSDPL: an
Mitigation        Economic and Financial Risk; a Political Risk; and an Institutional Capacity and
                  Reform Implementation Risk.
                  Economic. The Paraguayan economy grew by 15 percent in 2010, marking an
                  impressive recovery from the international financial crisis. However, the country
                  remains highly vulnerable to regional and global economic fluctuations and to
                  weather-related shocks. At the same time, the country is exposed to overheating
                  including inflation pressures, fast private sector credit growth, and a widening
                  current account deficit. The economy is also exposed to exchange rate risk due to
                  the continued high dollarization of the financial system and a large share of foreign
                  denominated public sector debt.
                  Mitigation: The government is implementing prudent fiscal management, including
                  efforts to increase tax revenues in the medium-term and improve expenditure
                  execution; monetary policy is being tightened and macro-prudential measures are
                  being taken to contain private sector credit growth. To this end the government
                  engages in technical assistance with the IMF on financial regulation and
                  supervision, including the cooperatives sector; the country’s external debt is low and
                  managed prudently; flexible exchange rate policy and a sufficient buffer of
                  international reserves provides a cushion for shocks.
                  Political. Entering into the second half of its term, the Government’s political
                  alliance is still fragmented and does not hold a majority of seats in Congress. There
                  is thus a risk of congressional bottlenecks when enacting new legal frameworks
                  associated with the reform program. Although selected measures for the operation
                  do not include the adoption of any laws, it is estimated that a significant political
                  risk for this operation remains given the implications of supported reforms in the
                  political economy. There is also a political risk associated to potential resistances to
                  reform programs, such as for instance in the case of SOEs.
                  Mitigation: The Government is carefully planning the submission of laws to
                  Congress to optimize information dissemination and probability of adoption. Also, it
                  usually works on building consensus around reform actions. The Presidency and the
                  Ministry of Finance are ensuring consistency and coordination with institutions
                  directly implementing reform actions. Finally, gradual approaches and effective
                  communication with reform stakeholders were also undertaken by the Government.
                  Institutional capacity and reform implementation. Weak human resource
                  capacity in the public sector, as well as limited inter-institutional cooperation could
                  put the success of the Government reform program at risk.
                  Mitigation: The program is focused on a limited number of inter-related policy areas
                  that are implemented by Government units with stronger capacities, such as the
                  UMEP for the SOE component. In addition, these areas are supported by external
                  technical assistance: internal control reform is supported by the USAID Umbral
                  Program; the SOE Oversight is supported by Bank technical assistance.

                                             I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The proposed US$100 million Public Sector Development Policy Loan (PSDPL)
to Paraguay is aimed at supporting fiscal management and public sector reforms. This
Development Policy Loan (DPL) supports the Government reform plans and builds upon the
significant achievements in several areas of a previous programmatic DPL in 2009.
2.        The operation was conceived within the context of the FY09-13 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) to support the implementation of the Government Reform
Plans. Building on the dialogue developed in partnership with the Government, the Bank
intends to contribute to the Government Plan’s overall objective of achieving sustainable and
more equitable growth by providing direct support to three of its pillars: (i) macroeconomic
policy; (ii) state-owned enterprises (SOEs); and (iii) state modernization.1 This DPL focuses on
three program components: (i) State oversight of State-Owned Enterprises; (ii) Public Sector
Financial Control (Central Administration); and (iii) the Tax System.

                                          II. COUNTRY CONTEXT
A. Political Context
3.        Three years into its mandate, the Government of President Lugo has made
progress in the execution of key themes of the Government Plan. Paraguay has strengthened
its economic growth and was the fastest growing country in Latin America in 2010. There has
been an important increase in private investment and a marked turn-around in agriculture,
industry and construction. The financial sector has weathered the global crisis well. Faced with
economic recession in 2009, the Government was able to boost public spending in the context
of a counter-cyclical stimulus package while maintaining progress in medium-term reforms
such as tax administration and oversight of state-owned enterprises. In addition, the
Government successfully re-negotiated the treaty related to the allocation of revenues from
Itaipu2, entailing an increase of US$240 million additional royalties on top of the US$120
million under the old treaty. There have also been advances in the health care sector with
achievements such as free access to primary health care.
4.        The Government now has two years remaining in which to advance the reform
agenda and consolidate previous achievements; without a majority in congress this will be
a challenging task. The Government is planning to consolidate reforms already achieved in
such areas as public financial management, tax administration, and oversight of state-owned
enterprises. The Government intends to create a development fund and a counter-cyclical
stabilization fund with the additional revenues from Itaipu. The Government also expects to see
additional progress in improving public service delivery and fiscal risk management. In order to
advance on these issues, the Government will need to build solid a consensus in Congress
during 2012.
B. Economic Context
5.    Paraguay is a small open economy that has undergone an economic turn-around,
yet challenges remain. Paraguay is a landlocked lower middle income country in South

    Royalties from the hydroelectric power plants on the Paraná River at the Brazil-Paraguay border, which represent
     a significant proportion of public revenue.


                                                          1
America with a population of 6.3 million and real per capita income of US$1,663 in 2010.
Paraguay’s economy strongly depends on its upper middle income MERCOSUR neighbors to
where it sends almost 50 percent of its goods and services exports. Since 2003, Paraguay has
experienced an economic turn-around which the 2009 crisis interrupted only temporarily.
Despite this development, Paraguay still faces structural challenges related to the economic and
public sector context.

Macroeconomic context

6.     Paraguay’s economic turn-around started in 2003, based on favorable external
conditions and an economic stabilization program. The country’s economy stagnated in the
late 1990s and early 2000s as the result of a domestic banking crisis and the negative fallout
from the economic turbulence experienced by the Southern Cone. Since 2003, strong external
demand resulted in fast export growth which in turn translated into a strong recovery of private
consumption and investment. In terms of sectors, trade and services contributed most to growth
(2.2 percent per year on average between 2003-2008) followed by the export oriented
agribusiness sector (1.8 percent per year on average). Between 2003 and 2008, average annual
real GDP growth exceeded 4.6 percent, contrasting with an average of 2.7 percent for the
preceding two decades.

7.      At the core of the Government’s stabilization program was a fiscal consolidation
program that allowed for the reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio and also kept inflation in
check. The Government engaged in a tax and customs reforms in 2004 with the aim of
formalizing the economy. Since then, the Government generated continuous and increasing
primary fiscal surpluses, averaging 2 percent of GDP between 2003 and 2008. The surpluses
resulted from relatively stable revenues at around 18 percent of GDP (including tax collections
that have stabilized at about 12 percent since 2004 and royalties from the two hydroelectric
power plants at Itaipu and Yacyreta) and primary spending that grew at a slower rate. Based on
the combination of continuous surpluses and solid economic growth, central government debt
as a percentage of GDP fell from 54 percent of GDP in 2002 to 18 percent in 2008 (Figure 1).
Additionally, sound fiscal policies together with the Central Bank’s focus on price stability
resulted in single-digit inflation most years.

8.     The 2009 crisis temporarily interrupted Paraguay’s economic turn-around. A
severe drought exacerbated the impact of the international economic crisis in Paraguay,

triggering a 3.8 percent real contraction of the economy in 2009. The agricultural sector was hit
most. Its production fell by an estimated 23.8 percent in real terms, primarily as a result of the
prolonged drought earlier in the year (Figure 2). In terms of aggregate demand, private
investment fell by 13 percent and household consumption by 2.9 percent in 2009. Despite a
significant fall in export revenues, Paraguay’s external position remained stable, based on the
drop of imports, a less than expected drop in remittances, and a relatively stable Guaraní
throughout 2009 (Figure 3). The financial sector also proved relatively resilient, after it had
previously recovered from the 1995-2003 banking crisis. There was no wide-spread credit
crunch, even though credit growth to the private sector ―slowed‖ down significantly to 33
percent in 2009—down from a peak of 75 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in May 2008
during the 2007-2008 credit boom. The share of foreign currency denominated loans remained
more or less stable at a high of 40 percent of the loan portfolio. Yet, foreign currency deposit
growth accelerated sharply from around 10 percent y-o-y in earlier years to a brief peak of 60
percent in July 2009. In addition, the already high share of short-term deposits rose slightly to
70 percent in 2009. Overall, the quality of banks’ loan portfolios remained adequate, and
liquidity and capitalization levels were sufficient.3

9.        The Government’s policy response was instrumental in containing the impact of
the crisis, and the macroeconomic framework remained appropriate. The Government’s
Anti-Crisis Plan, which was presented to Congress in January 2009, included measures aimed
at: providing a fiscal stimulus through expanded public spending programs; ensuring sufficient
liquidity in the financial system; ensuring access to financing for the productive sectors; and
accelerating the mobilization of external resources.4 At the same time, the Government has also
remained committed to the prudent macroeconomic policies laid out in the Government’s
Strategic Economic and Social Plan. Concretely, the Government’s Anti-Crisis Plan boosted
public consumption and investment with current expenditure up by 2.8 percent of GDP relative
to 2008 and capital expenditure up by 1.9 percent. The increase in current expenditure included

Despite the increase in spending, the fiscal balance closed in surplus due to an increase in tax
revenues. Despite the increase in spending and a fall in economic activity, the fiscal balance
closed in surplus due to an increase in tax revenues, underlining the positive impact of the tax
administration reforms of recent years. Also, the Central Bank drastically reduced its reference
rates in 2009, remaining below 2 percent during the second half of the year. In addition, it
lowered legal reserve requirements to zero percent for local currency deposits of one year or
more, and foreign currency deposits of 541 days or more. Finally, in March 2009, it introduced
an emergency liquidity facility available to all banks.5
Economic Structural Challenges

9.     Reducing poverty and inequality remains a top priority and challenge. Moderate
and extreme poverty levels fell significantly during recent years, yet have remained at
comparatively high levels. Total poverty fell from 49.7 percent in 2002 to 34.7 percent in 2010.
The reduction of extreme poverty has been more volatile; it oscillated between 24.4 percent in
2002 to 16.5 percent in 2005. In 2010, extreme poverty rose from 18.8 percent to 19.4 percent
despite the strong economic growth. Extreme poverty remains particularly prevalent in rural
areas with an incidence of 32.4 percent, compared to 10.3 percent in urban areas (Figure 4 & 5).
10.     Despite record growth in 2010, extreme poverty increased. This suggests that
extremely poor households did not benefit. In particular, the incidence of rural extreme poverty
remained constant between 2009 and 2010, while urban extreme poverty increased by 1
percentage point. Initial analyses suggest that Paraguayans at the low end of the income
distribution were negatively affected by sticky nominal wages at the same time as international
food prices surged. The positive effects of high growth seem not to have reached them. In
2010, extraordinarily strong meat and soy production were main drivers for growth, products
that small-scale and subsistence farmers do not produce. Inequality increased as well; the Gini
coefficient of income distribution moved up from 0.487 in 2009 to 0.512 in 2010, one of the
highest in Latin America. The wealthiest 10 percent hold 41.1 percent of the nation’s income
while the poorest 10 percent hold merely 1.1.

11.    Economic informality is both a challenge and an impediment to sustained growth
in Paraguay. A 2008 IMF study estimated the size of the Paraguayan informal economy at
around 70 percent of formal GDP. It also identified labor rigidities as a significant factor
contributing to this result.6 Sizable informal activities combined with public sector performance
induce high transaction costs, divert the allocation of resources away from key social
investments, and reduce the quality and quantity of basic public services.

    The Government has been collaborating with the World Bank to identify areas where the crisis management
    framework can be further strengthened, in particular with regards to the banking sector and pension supervision.

* Total poverty incidence is defined as the percentage of the population living below the poverty line (urban
poverty line 2010: Gs.376,753 or US$82.05 a month; and metropolitan poverty line for Asunción 2010: Gs.525,960
or US$114.54 a month; versus rural poverty line 2010: Gs.325,707 or US$70.93 a month).
** Extreme poverty incidence is defined as the percentage of the population living below the extreme poverty line
(urban extreme poverty line 2010: Gs.243,662 or US$53.06 a month; and metropolitan extreme poverty line for
Asunción 2010: Gs.317,510 or US$69.14 a month; versus rural extreme poverty line 2010: Gs.225,470 or
US$49.10 a month).

12.     Furthermore, sustainable economic growth is impacted by low expenditure
execution. Total expenditure execution in Paraguay is low by international standards. It
amounted to 84.8 percent in 2010, compared to 86.9 percent in 2009 (current expenditure
execution declined by 1 percentage point to 92.5 in 2010 relative to the previous year, and
capital expenditure execution declined by almost 7 percentage points to 64.2 percent). The
deteriorating trend in expenditure execution continued in 2011 with capital expenditure
execution rates amounting to 23.7 percent in July 2011 compared to 27.6 in July 2010.
13.     Some contingent fiscal risks remain in SOEs that might bind public resources
when needed. Public enterprises generated operating surpluses of around 1 percent of GDP in
recent years and are projected to do so again in the coming years. Yet, total debt of the four
largest SOEs represents around 6 percent of GDP. In the past, comprehensive financial
information on SOEs was not publicly available, although recent SOEs reforms have allowed
for more transparency and financial monitoring, including the publication of annual audits. This
helped to reveal existing financial challenges. For instance, the 2010 audit of the oil company
PETROPAR (Petróleos Paraguayos) showed that the company had two times more liabilities
than assets, mostly because of payment arrears to foreign suppliers. At the end of 2010, the
company also had Gs.1.7 trillion (1.9 percent of GDP) in debt to foreign suppliers. Under the
current oil price mechanism, domestic prices for fuel do not reflect international oil prices; the
company’s fortunes thus depend to a large extent on the price of the oil products that it imports,
almost exclusively from the Venezuelan Oil Company PDVSA (Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.).
Public Sector Structural Challenges

14.      Paraguay’s public sector performance remains a key challenge for equitable
growth and development. Stronger public sector performance could have enhanced further
equitable growth and development through more effective public policies, regulations, and
service delivery. Significant opportunities for improvement remain in areas such as financial


                                                                                        6
control; institutional reorganization and development; introducing basics for results-based
management frameworks; and tax administration. At the same time, there is a need to ensure
the sustainability of the public sector reforms that have been initiated. Areas that offer
opportunities of improvement and impact upon public sector performance include:
 Public Service and SOEs: Paraguayan SOEs provide essential goods and services,
   including oil, water, telecommunications and electricity. Their performance in terms of
   service delivery and management could be significantly improved. For example, in 2010,
   only 43.5 percent of urban households under the responsibility of the water SOE had
   sewage coverage, and electricity production still experiences 32.6 percent production
   technical loss.
 Internal control: Effectiveness of internal control procedures and practices as well as
   limited institutional capacities impacts on accountability and use of public resources for
   their intended purpose.
 Tax Administration: Tax administration capacities are limited, and this impacts on the
   capability to collect taxes and implement existing tax policies, in turn restricting available
   resources for public policies and service delivery.

15.       These challenges are deeply seated in a number of structural constraints which
render public sector reforms in Paraguay more complex. These constraints include:
  Discretionary practices in the public sector. Improving efficiency, effectiveness and
     transparency and reducing discretionary practices remain a structural challenge for
     Paraguay public sector, which the administration has inherited.
 Role of Congress. The Constitution of 1992 and other major organic laws, give the
    Legislature a strong role within Paraguay’s division of powers, which include attributes that
    are usually associated with the Executive, inter alia, the authority to increase budget
    expenditures, approval for externally financed projects, and influence in determining public
    sector wages. This situation together with party fragmentation of Congress hinders the
    ability of the Executive to undertake reform initiatives.
C. Recent Economic Developments in Paraguay
16.        In 2010, the Paraguayan economy rebounded strongly based on an agricultural
export boom that carried over to the rest of the economy. Paraguay’s 15 percent real growth
rate in 2010 marks the country’s highest growth on record and indicated a strong recovery from
the 2009 recession. Real exports grew by 35.3 percent in 2010. Soy and meat were the most
important export goods, accounting for almost 39 percent and 18 percent respectively of the
total, and contributing to export growth with over 30 and 6 percent respectively. Increased
agricultural export revenues translated into additional disposable income, which bolstered
domestic demand. Private consumption contributed 6.8 percent to real growth followed by
investment with a 4.2 percent contribution. In terms of sectors, the agriculture sector
contributed most to overall growth (8 percent), followed by trade and services (5 percent).
Despite strong growth, the construction sector contributed little to overall growth (0.5 percent)
since its share in the economy remains low.
18.       With fast economic growth, the Paraguayan economy has shown signs of
overheating. Capacity constraints and a surge in international commodity prices have lead to
significant inflation pressures in Paraguay. Consumer price inflation picked up strongly in the
second half of 2010. At the end of the year, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reached 7.2


                                               7
percent, close to the upper bound of the Central Bank’s target band of 5 percent +/- 2.5
percentage points. As of March 2011 Headline CPI inflation reached 10.3 percent, before
retreating to 8.8 percent in August 2011. In addition, private sector credit has expanded rapidly.
Its growth rate averaged 36 percent y-o-y throughout 2010, based on record low interest rates at
the beginning of the year. The Central Bank responded to elevated inflation and credit growth
by raising interest rates by 850 basis points between May 2010 and mid-September 2011. As a
consequence, credit growth peaked at 44 percent y-o-y in October 2010 and then flattened out,
it remained at elevated levels until February 2011 (40 percent y-o-y). In March 2011 private
credit growth began to fall significantly. As of July 2011, it stood at 23 percent y-o-y. In
addition, the Central Bank also raised reserve requirements and brought them back up to pre-
crisis levels in April 2011—3 and 4 percentage points for domestic and foreign currency
deposits respectively.
19.     The country’s current account position weakened based on strong domestic
demand growth, while the overall external position remained relatively unchanged.
Paraguay’s current account balance turned into a deficit of 3.2 percent of GDP in 2010. On the
basis of strong domestic demand, imports grew rapidly, so that net exports contributed less to
real growth than domestic demand aggregates. Over a third of imports were capital goods that
potentially facilitate higher growth in the medium term. In addition to rapid import growth,
remittances continued to drop in 2010 explaining the current account deficit. However, on the
basis of strong foreign direct inflows, the Central Bank continued to accumulate international
reserves. International reserves reached US$4.2 billion (or 23 percent of GDP) by the end of
2010 and continued to increase throughout 2011. As of end July 2011, the Guaraní appreciated
by 16.5 percent relative to the US Dollar compared to end-2010. Improved terms of trade,
strong foreign direct investment inflows, and seasonal liquidation of export proceeds are the
main factors behind this rise.
20.     Fiscal policy remained expansionary in 2010, yet the fiscal balance remained in
surplus due to strong revenue collection. Total public expenditures remained above pre-crisis
levels relative to GDP in 2010, based on sustained attention to social programs and an effort to
keep up public investment. The continued expansion of conditional cash transfer programs, the
non-contributory pensions, increased health expenditures, and infrastructure spending all
explain, to a large extent, an increase of 8.9 percent of total expenditure in nominal terms that
translated into a 1.8 percentage point decrease relative to GDP. Total expenditure amounted to
17.8 percent of GDP in 2010. Capital expenditure declined by 0.8 percentage points of GDP in
2010 and reached 3.8 percent of GDP. At the same time, booming economic growth led to a
significant increase in tax collection in 2010. Overall, total revenues in 2010 reached 19.2
percent of GDP. As of July 2011, revenues were still growing at an accelerating rate of 19.7
percent (nominal y-o-y).
D. Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability
Short and medium-term growth outlook
21.    Under the baseline scenario, economic growth is expected to slow down in 2011 but
to remain above long-term trend growth. Based on a return of agricultural growth to more
normal levels and tighter monetary conditions, growth is expected to slow to 5.5 percent in
2011. The soy crop in 2011 is even expected to surpass the record numbers for 2010. This,
together with high international commodity prices, explains the above trend growth. If credit


                                                8
growth remains higher than expected and it is accompanied by higher domestic demand,
growth could be higher still in the short-run. The current, fast expansion of credit also involves
the risk of an abrupt deceleration, which poses a down-side risk to growth in the medium-term.
22.      In terms of down side risks, Paraguay is exposed to fluctuations in international
demand and commodity prices through its strong dependence on agricultural exports. To
account for this risk the debt sustainability analysis shows a scenario that is consistent with a
significant slowdown in the global economy. In the medium term, growth is expected to revert
to its trend of around 4 percent.
23.      Inflation is expected to remain above the Central Bank’s target range until 2013.
CPI inflation is expected to reach over 10 percent y-o-y, well above the Central Bank’s target
band of 5 percent (+/- 2.5pp). This development hinges on the economy’s signs of overheating
(e.g. hitting capacity constraints in the construction sector), and continuously high international
commodity prices. With growth reverting to trend growth and commodity prices moderating,
inflation is expected to return to a level within the target range by 2013. If growth remains
stronger in line with international commodity prices, inflation pressures could remain strong.
24.     The current account deficit could worsen further in 2011 and then slowly improve
in the medium term. The current account is projected to worsen as imports recover, to around
-4.0 percent of GDP in 2011. The current account deficit is expected to be financed through
capital inflows as foreign direct investment increases and companies repatriate profits. With
lower economic growth and subsiding commodity prices the current account deficit is expected
to moderate over the medium-term.
25.     Driven by a robust economic recovery, the fiscal balance is expected to show a
modest overall surplus in 2011 that will slip into deficit as presidential elections get closer.
For 2011, an overall surplus of 0.3 percent is projected. The budget foresees a continued fiscal
stimulus, with spending projected to be around 19.8 percent of GDP. This includes a continued
effort to maintain higher levels of capital expenditure. On the revenue side, customs and
import-related VAT revenues are expected to recover to pre-crisis levels. Tax revenues have
increased to 13.4 percent of GDP in 2010 from 13.0 percent in 2009. They are expected to
reach 14.1 percent in 2011 and 14.0 percent in 2012 under the baseline scenario. These
increases are expected to be caused by continued improvements in tax administration, tax
policy, increases in the profits of domestic companies and imports. Other revenues, especially
royalties from Yacyreta and Itaipu (which are denominated in US$), are projected to increase in
the medium term, as an agreement with Brazil on the increase in Itaipu royalties becomes
effective. The proposed increase in royalties for energy sold to Brazil was approved by the
Brazilian House of Representatives and still has to be approved by the Brazilian Senate. The
increase would imply US$360 million in royalties instead of US$120 million.
26.     Financing needs are expected to be manageable. Gross financing needs are projected
to increase from US$259 million in 2011 to US$349 million in 2013, 1.2 percent of GDP in
both cases. The financing needs stem to a large extent from total amortizations that peak at
US$317 million in 2011 and then subside to US$217 million in 2013 (Table 2). In 2012 and
2013 modest primary deficits of 0.3 and 0.2 percent of GDP respectively, add to the financing
needs. Disbursements of external loans are expected to reach US$283 million in 2012 and
US$233 million in 2013, including new budget support. After abstaining from bond issuance in
2010, the Government is planning to issue domestic bonds in the amount of US$143 million


                                                9
and US$116 million in 2012 and 2013 respectively. If all or part of the budget support
operations are not approved by Congress in the course of 2012 or 2013, the Government has
some room to increase the issuance of domestic bonds and/or use part of the net public sector
deposits with the Central Bank, these amounted to US$1.04 billion as of September 12, 2011.7
In 2010 alone, the Government deposited US$314 million, including US$100 million of the
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), which have not yet been spent.

Debt sustainability analysis
27.     Paraguay’s debt burden and debt servicing indicators are manageable under
reasonable assumptions. Under the baseline scenario, public debt levels will remain
sustainable. Central government debt is projected to decrease from an estimated 16.5 percent of
GDP in 2010 to 12.3 percent in 2011, and to then gradually fall to 10.5 percent by 2014.
Sensitivity analyses suggest that the main vulnerabilities of Paraguay’s fiscal accounts stem
from low growth and a depreciation in the exchange rate, since a large share of public debt is
denominated in foreign currency. If the economy grew on average 1.8 percentage points less
than under the baseline scenario throughout the projection period, debt levels would reach 14.6
percent by 2014.


7
    The annual budget law usually authorizes the issuance of domestic bonds up to US$250 or US$300 million.


                                                        10
28.     An additional scenario indicates that debt levels would remain sustainable under
the assumption of a significant slow-down in global growth and the impact of the foot and
mouth disease in 2012. Recent estimates, including those of market analysts, suggest that
growth in an average Latin American country could potentially drop by 2 percentage points in
the case of the materialization of a drop of 5 percent in growth in China. Such a potential
reduction of growth in China would be one potential realization of the looming risks on global
economic activity. Taking this risk into account, one scenario shows debt development under a
3 percent growth slow-down in Paraguay in 2012. This scenario would be consistent with the
assumed slow-down in growth in China for that year together with a negative impact of foot
and mouth disease. The scenario further assumes a recovery in 2013. Also in this case, debt
levels are expected to remain sustainable reaching 12.5 percent in 2014. Finally, a one-time 30
percent exchange rate depreciation in 2011, would cause the debt-to-GDP ratio to deteriorate
rapidly to 18.3 in 2011, falling to 17.7 in 2012 and remaining volatile thereafter.
29.    Contingent liabilities also pose a risk. Total debt of the four largest SOEs represent
around 6 percent of GDP and all SOEs represent 30 percent of total public expenditure. If
Government had to cover debt and/or deficits of these entities, in a negative scenario, a shock
of around 10 percent of GDP could occur. Such a contingent liability shock of 10 percent of
GDP over the baseline would have a significant impact on debt levels, pushing them up to 19.7
percent by the end of the projected period. However, the Government has taken measures to
mitigate this risk employing SOE oversight reform, which is supported by this operation.
30.     There are a number of downside risks to the baseline macroeconomic scenario.
While the immediate threat from uncertain weather conditions and the attendant lower
agricultural production in 2011 appear to have passed, Paraguay remains primarily vulnerable
to external factors. The slow recovery in developed economies and the demand impact on
emerging economies pose a risk to Paraguay, particularly through its exposure to Brazil and
Argentina. The main concern in the medium term is the high cost of energy, especially oil, and
the high price of other raw materials. Slower growth in Argentina and Brazil, as well as in
Paraguay’s other main export markets, could negatively impact the pace of economic growth.
In addition, Paraguay’s heavy dependence on agriculture means that its economic prospects are
vulnerable to climatic factors such as droughts, extreme temperature swings and floods. A
potentially abrupt deceleration of the fast expansion of credit is a domestic risk factor.8
31.      Notwithstanding certain downside risks to the economic outlook, Paraguay’s
macroeconomic framework is deemed adequate for this proposed loan. In particular, the
low debt-to-GDP ratio and the prudent fiscal policy management throughout the economic
downturn suggest a low level of risk for this operation. Based on very low debt-to-GDP ratio,
Paraguay seems to have the fiscal space to maintain spending even under the assumption of
severe shocks to economic growth. Medium-term borrowing requirements are manageable,
given the Government’s fiscal position and planned levels of multilateral financing. Monetary
and exchange rate policy management is also supportive of macroeconomic and financial
stability. If tail risks to global and domestic growth materialize, the expectation is that the
Government would take appropriate measures and that multilateral financing could provide
additional contingent financing to mitigate such risks.

     III. THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES
32.     The overall objective of the Government Plan, presented in September 2008, was
to achieve more sustainable and equitable growth for Paraguay through six strategic
objectives: (i) fostering growth with a focus on employment generation and improved income
distribution, while preserving a sound macroeconomic framework; (ii) strengthening
Government institutions to improve the rule of law, policy making, and the delivery of services;
(iii) improving the efficiency of public sector social expenditures while focusing on extreme
poverty alleviation; (iv) promoting the diversification of the production structure, through the
optimal use of national energy and human resources while safeguarding the environment; (v)
fostering economic development and ensuring broader citizen participation; and (vi) supporting
decentralized development. These objectives were planned to be achieved through the
implementation of the eight strategic pillars of the Government Plan (Plan Estratégico
Económico y Social - PEES).9
33.     As the economic crisis unfolded, the Government adapted its priorities to the
changing circumstances through the 2009 Anti-Crisis Plan. Following the economic
deceleration, which started in Q4 2008, the Government launched its 2009 Anti-Crisis Plan,
aimed at smoothing the impact of the international economic crisis on unemployment and
poverty. Despite the dramatic economic downturn, the Plan ensured that the private sector
continued to have access to credit and that an increasing share of the extreme poor was covered
by the social safety net.10
34.    Priorities from the Government Program have now shifted back to longer-term
challenges, including public sector strengthening. Post-crisis priorities are to pursue the
goals of the 2008 Government Plan with three main strategic dimensions: social development
and poverty reduction; economic growth with a focus on competitiveness and private sector
development; and public sector strengthening.
35.     Public sector strengthening is now focused on public finance and supports both
consolidation of previous achievements and progress of the reform agenda. On the one
hand, the Government plans to consolidate achievements in: (i) revenue mobilization, through
continued strengthening of the tax administration and efforts to introduce a personal income
tax; (ii) expenditure management, with emphasis on budget execution, internal control and
audit functions, and SOEs oversight; and (iii) strengthening public finance institutional
framework through legal changes and clarification of responsibilities. On the other hand, the
Government is contemplating advancing the reform agenda in fiscal risk management and
public investment. Within public investment, policy actions will be strongly related to the
management of additional public revenues from Itaipu royalties. To this end, the Government
envisages creating a counter-cyclical stabilization fund and a special development fund. The
latter will be exclusively dedicated to investment in highways, health, education, research and
development. In addition, a Public Investment Directorate will be established at the Ministry of
Finance to enhance management and coordination with the Technical Planning Secretariat.11
9
   These eight pillars were: (i) stable and consistent macroeconomic policy framework; (ii) strengthened financial
   sector; (iii) effective provision of services by state-owned enterprises (SOEs); (iv) modernization of the State;
   (v) enhanced productivity and competitiveness; (vi) comprehensive land reform; (vii) employment generation
   and poverty alleviation; and (viii) promote infrastructure development. Source: PEES.

Regarding fiscal risk management, the Government will implement a new debt management
strategy; enhance fiscal control of local governments and decentralize public entities; it will
also strengthen supervision and monitoring of cooperatives.
Participatory Process and Consultations
36.    The Government’s reform program is an outcome of extensive consultations with
stakeholders. The Government has worked together with civil society and relevant actors in
the policy areas covered by the PSDPL. Prior to assuming office, the Government widely
disseminated its strategy, with particular attention to public sector reform. This strategy was
made accessible on the Ministry of Finance website. At the same time, the Government
developed an inter-ministerial dialogue on these topics. The priorities defined as a result of
these consultations are consistent with current reforms related to SOE oversight, Internal
Control, and Tax System.
37.     In addition to these initial consultations, current reforms targeted by this
program benefitted from specific consultations. With regard to SOE oversight, workshops
and conferences were held with members of Congress and the media in order to disseminate
and explain the objectives and scope of the reform. Constant communication and consultation
were also established with representatives from SOEs. In the area of internal control, a
continuous process of consultation and setting-up of committees was developed in parallel to
the design and implementation of the new internal control framework.
38.     During PSDPL implementation, the Government also envisages continuing
consultations with the civil society, with a focus on the social monitoring of SOEs service
delivery indicators. The Government, through UMEP, is considering introducing mechanisms
for information exchange with citizens regarding the evolution of performance indicators on
public services provided by the SOEs. These actions could reinforce the monitoring and
oversight of SOEs, and generate a demand-side request for sustaining the reform process.
                  IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM
A. Link to CPS
39.     The Public Sector DPL (PSDPL) is supporting the governance and equitable
growth objectives of the 2009-2013 CPS. Two out of the three cross-cutting themes addressed
by the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (Report No. 48087, discussed by the Executive
Directors on May 5, 2009 )– governance, poverty reduction, and equitable growth – are
supported by the PSDPL. On the one hand, the PSDPL serves as a central instrument through
which the CPS provides direct support to the governance theme. On the other hand, the PSDPL
contributes to the sustainable growth objectives of the CPS by supporting tax revenue
objectives. There are also strong synergies between this Development Policy Loan (DPL) and
several other Bank operations in Paraguay. Finally, the PSDPL is expected to continue to play a
key role in donor coordination, as evidenced in the cooperation for the preparation of the
previous Public Sector Programmatic DPL.12

                                    (2013))

B. Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors
40.     Since Paraguay’s successful completion of two consecutive Stand-By
Arrangements (SBA) with the IMF in August 2008, no new IMF program has been
requested. Macroeconomic performance under the SBAs, which supported the previous
Government’s economic reform program, was strong. All outcomes under the second program,
except inflation, exceeded program targets. The SBAs also targeted structural measures in four
areas: (i) public sector reforms;13 (ii) financial sector reforms;14 (iii) pro-growth reforms,
including strengthening the management of SOEs; and (iv) improving the social safety net by
expanding coverage of the conditional cash transfer program. Most of the structural
benchmarks were met, although there were delays in the implementation of results-based
management contracts with some of the SOEs. The IMF maintains an open dialogue with the
authorities, and IMF staff conducted annual Article IV missions in March 2009, April 2010,
and June 2011. The IMF also has a number of technical assistance activities in Paraguay,
including: financial soundness of the cooperatives sector, energy subsidies, banking
supervision, and monetary policy. A joint Financial Sector Assessment Program visited
Paraguay in November 2010. Based on this, a Financial System Stability Assessment15 was
published in July 2011. The Bank and IMF teams consult each other through regular meetings
and bi-annual country-team level consultations.
41.     Preparation of the PSDPL provides the opportunity to strengthen donor
coordination on related policy areas. Building on the 2009 Bank First Public Sector
Programmatic DPL (P113457, Loan 7700-PY), which represented a significant proportion of
the multi-donor program supporting the 2009 Anti-Crisis Plan, the PSDPL is fostering
International Finance Corporation (IFI) and multi-donor support to public finance reforms in
Paraguay. On the one hand, the Bank and IADB are leading the work on public finance and
fiscal management through complementary development policy programs with distinct and
complementary policy areas. On the other hand, with regard to the area of Internal Control of
the Central Administration, PSDPL budgetary support and USAID Umbral Technical
Assistance are mutually supportive.
C. Relationship to Other Bank Operations
42.    The current operation builds on the previous public sector programmatic
development policy loan series that started in 2009. The programmatic series was prepared
in the context of an in-coming government and an uncertain economic outlook; it was

13
   Including financial management, public investment system, tax and customs administration and pension reform.
14
    Ensuring an adequate capitalization of private and public banks and the Central Bank, also improving the
   regulatory framework for financial institutions.

conceived to support the Government Plan for public sector reforms and the Anti-Crisis Plan
for the most part. This three-loan series supported the Government program and the Anti-Crisis
Plan via four components: internal financial control, oversight of SOEs, efficiency of public
expenditure, and civil service reform. The first operation (First Public Sector Programmatic
DPL (P113457, Loan 7700-PY), was successfully executed during the first semester of 2009.
However, the triggers for the second operation were completed not long after the two-year
period authorized between the board dates of two operations in programmatic series, and hence
the series could not be continued.
43.     Despite the termination of the programmatic series, outcome indicators were
achieved faster than expected, and many indicators from the previously planned PDPL2
and PDPL3 were met. Despite the slower reform pace, the Government remained committed
and cooperated with the Bank, which led to achieving indicators before deadline, and the
fulfillment of numerous triggers from PDPL2 and PDPL3.16
44.     The Government requested World Bank support for its reform effort representing
a streamlined continuation of the efforts supported by the previous programmatic DPL
series. The government reform program now focuses on the oversight of SOEs, internal
control, and the tax system. The program has adapted to the changing environment, Paraguay
came out of the crisis following a strong recovery in 2010. In addition, it has been adjusted to
focus on the most successful areas of reform. Given both the need for streamlining the reform
program on most successful policy areas and the normative requirements of programmatic
DPLs, particularly in terms of duration limits between each programmatic loan, the
Government has now requested a stand-alone operation, but indicated its commitment to
continue reforms in the medium term (see Annex 1).
45.     The PSDPL is also linked to a number of projects in Paraguay through its focus on
governance. The PSDPL addresses governance challenges associated with the management of
SOEs and strengthens the Government’s internal control function. Other projects contribute to
strengthening good governance practices in specific sectors: (i) The Water and Sanitation
Sector Modernization Project (P095235, Loan No. 7710-PY) promotes institutional-based and
social accountability activities, improving corporate governance of the water company ESSAP
(Empresa de Servicios Sanitarios del Paraguay) and consolidating the sector governance and
regulatory framework; (ii) the Energy Sector Strengthening Project (P114971, Loan No. 7994-
PY) enhances overall business related processes at ANDE (Administración Nacional de
Electricidad) and its environmental, social and internal auditing units in particular, with the
goal of increasing transparency of planning, execution, and evaluation processes;17 (iii) the
Road Maintenance Project (P082026, Loan No. 7406-PY) that elevates the profile of activities
towards increased transparency within the Ministry of Public Works and Communication
primarily with the help of an electronic tool to implement and monitor the Improved
Governance Control Framework; and (iv) the Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development

   See Implementation Completion Report (Report No: ICR00001966) on the First Public Sector Programmatic
   DPL, Annex 7 and 8.
17
    The proposed PSDPL is complementary to the Energy Sector project because it supports the adoption of a
   management contract with ANDE, and the establishment of a Dashboard Panel electronically connecting the
   SOE Monitoring Unit (UMEP) to ANDE, in order to monitor indicators on financial performance, quality of
   customer services, corporate resources, technical losses (distribution/transmission), and other performance
   indicators agreed under ANDE’s management contract.

Project (PRODERS) (P088799, Loan No. 7503-PY) supports agricultural development by
reaffirming leadership and coordination of different public sector agencies in provision of
services to producers and indigenous communities.
46.    Complementarities also exist between the PSDPL and programmatic non-lending
technical assistance foreseen in the CPS. The programmatic non-lending technical assistance
for public sector reform is building on the dialogue developed by the PSDPL, with the purpose
of providing advisory services and the transfer of know-how needed by the Government to
achieve its public sector reform goals. The technical assistance program includes a recently
approved Bank-executed Spanish Trust Fund Paraguay Enhancing Public Sector Effectiveness
– SFLAC (P120699), which supports the Government on SOEs reforms.

D. Lessons Learned
47.     Previous development policy operations suggest that adapting to country context
and strong national ownership is critical for smooth implementation. The 2003 Economic
Recovery Adjustment Loan (P086543, Loan No. 7210-PY) provided a quick response to the
Government’s financing needs, while at the same time taking advantage of the momentum for
reform.18 Its successful implementation was due to strong national ownership; consensus
among political actors as well as international financial entities; and balance between political
feasibility and depth of reform. Similarly, in the case of Paraguay’s Programmatic DPL I
approved in 2009, ownership led directly to: the achievement of the PDO; fostered the
country’s dialog on development priorities; and made it possible to adapt to internal and
external changes affecting the program’s implementation. Careful assessment of the program’s
support across a wide range of constituencies, including NGOs, IFIs, and other stakeholders,
conducted during the preparation stage played a critical role in helping to correctly gauge
political risk.
48.     Sustained engagement on the part of the Bank is key to supporting reform
processes over the medium and long term. As in most countries, Paraguay’s path toward
reform has been long and uneven. Some pieces of legislation which form the cornerstone of the
reform process were approved a decade ago, including the Financial Administration Law
(1999) and the Tax Reform Act (2004). Likewise, the reforms supported under the 2003
Economic Recovery Adjustment Loan (P086543, Loan No. 7210-PY) and the 2005 Financial
Sector Adjustment Loan (P039994, Loan No. 7187-PY) provided the foundation for the reforms
supported under the Programmatic DPL I. Although momentum for reform subsided during the
late 2000s, the Bank continued its engagement with Paraguay’s Ministry of Finance through
fiduciary assessments and other non-operational tasks. This sustained engagement made it
possible for the Bank to respond quickly and effectively to the new administration’s request for
support of its reform program under programmatic DPL I.


18
     The loan covered five policy areas: (i) fiscal stabilization; (ii) tax policy; (iii) public administration and anti-
     corruption; (iv) financial sector; and (v) public sector pension fund.


                                                            16
49.     In the context of Paraguay, continuation of medium-term reforms should focus
primarily on areas where there is consensus and clear leadership for change. With the
support of strong political will, the Ministry of Finance is actively promoting a well-defined set
of reforms that are both technically and politically feasible. Yet, the political support needed to
carry out a broad civil service reform is still lacking.
E. Analytical Underpinnings
50.     The proposed PSDPL is based on a series of analytical studies including those
undertaken by the Bank; lessons learned from the previous DPL; and reports prepared
jointly with other donors. The substantial body of analytical work has provided the basis for
an in-depth dialogue with the Government and has supported, jointly with the Government
Plan, the design of the PSDPL. Table 5 shows the links between the policy areas and the
macroeconomic framework included in the PSDPL as well as the main findings and
recommendations of the analytical work.

Oversight of   OECD Survey on Corporate Governance of SOEs in Member States (2005)
State          The survey showed that the general trend for organization of the ownership function was to move
Owned          from the decentralized model – still valid in Paraguay– where ministries supervise SOEs related to
Enterprises    their respective sectors, to the centralized model whereby a single entity acts as the SOE
               shareholder on behalf of the State. In all OECD countries, SOEs are audited annually by an
               international private audit firm and their financial statements are public. Finally, SOEs are usually
               public corporations and the regulatory framework is controlled by independent agencies.
               Bank Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) for Accounting and
               Auditing (2006)
                  Auditing standards for SOEs are extremely limited; most notably annual audits in accordance
                    with international standards are not mandatory;
                  Audited financial statements of SOEs are not required to be published.
               Understanding Sector Performance: The Case of Utilities in LAC (2009)
               The LAC survey showed that the strength of SOE’s corporate governance in Paraguay was low in
               comparative terms, although it was increasing in terms of legal soundness and transparency. In
               addition, Paraguay scored highest in the Region in performance orientation, and CEP was singled
               out as one of the few initial examples of centralized responsibilities in the SOEs oversight in LAC.

               The ICR shows that the Government has succeeded in creating since 2008 an institutional
               framework to oversee the performance and financial soundness of SOEs, by: introducing results-
               based management contracts for the major SOEs; enhancing rationality in budget allocations for
               SOEs; improving transparency regarding their financial management; and initiating actions to
               correct the debt balance in favor of SOEs. The government has also submitted a draft Law to
               Congress in order to consolidate this institutional framework.

               In turn, proposed tax policy measures aim at increasing tax pressure and tax equity by completing
               and improving the efficiency of taxes defined by the 2004 Fiscal Adjustment Law.

                                 V. THE PROPOSED OPERATION
A. Operation Description
51.     The overall development objective of the proposed PSDPL is to contribute to the
effectiveness and efficiency of the public sector. This is expected to be reached via the
following specific objectives: (i) exerting effective Oversight of SOEs; (ii) improving Central
Administration’s internal financial control; and (iii) strengthening the Tax System.
52.     The PSDPL (US$100 million) is a stand-alone DPL expected to be executed in
FY12. The PSDPL includes three components: SOEs oversight; public sector financial control
in the Central Administration; and Tax System. The policy matrix for the Program, including
the prior actions, and key outcomes indicators, is presented in Annex 2.
53.     The scope of the PSDPL was determined by building on lessons learned from
previous operations, particularly from Programmatic DPL1. Expected achievements will
build on the active reform agenda of the Government, and on the successes from the previous
DPL.19 These program components and actions have been selected with the country’s most
relevant development challenges in mind, as well as priorities communicated by the
Government. They also consider both structural institutional constraints and the current
political context. Aware of implementation difficulties to previous reform efforts, prior actions
and triggers were defined with the Government in order to maintain flexibility and to minimize
the risk of potential political gridlock.
54.    The operation has a direct link to the Government Plan (Plan Estratégico
Económico y Social - PEES). The operation directly supports Government plans to consolidate
previous achievements in reforming revenue mobilization; internal control and audit functions;
and SOEs oversight.
55.     The proposed PSDPL program incorporates current good practice guidelines.
These practices for development policy lending are outlined in Operation Policy/Bank
Procedure (OP/BP) 8.60, Development Policy Lending, as summarized in Box 1. While
maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic framework is not an explicit prior action or a
trigger for DPLs, it is a fundamental requirement for DPL lending under OP 8.60.




19
      Main successful reforms supported by the previous operation included: SOEs oversight reform, internal
     financial control, and tax system strengthening.

                                 Box 1. Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Country Ownership
Ownership has been a critical aspect of both the design and the implementation of this program. The Bank has
actively cooperated with the Government since President Lugo won elections in April 2008. To this end, the Bank
presented a set of policy notes to the authorities in June 2008. Since 2008, the Bank has provided technical
assistance in oversight of SOEs, which has been instrumental to the current reform achievements. Also, while the
Executive could not advance at the expected pace due to legislative challenges, alternative solutions were
implemented in targeted policy areas, showing government commitment to the objectives of reforms being
supported by the PSDPL. Finally, PSDPL components are aligned with the pillars of the Government’s Strategic
Economic and Social Plan for 2008-2013.
Principle 2: Agree upfront with the Government and other financing partners on a clear division of labor
On macroeconomic and fiscal issues, the Bank and the IMF coordinate regularly, but there is currently no active
IMF program. In addition, the previous PDPLI became a significant part of a multi-donor funding package
supporting the Government’s 2009 Anti-Crisis Plan, and the policy areas covered by the loan received additional
support from IFI/donor technical assistance programs spelled out in section IV.3. Development stakeholders
coordinated their actions to ensure clear division of labor and complementary actions. Of particular note: for the
areas under the auspices of the PSDPL, development policy lending is covered by the Bank while TA is covered
by the Bank for SOEs, USAID/UMBRAL for Internal Audit and Control, and IMF for Tax System. Finally, the
PSDPL is deepening the reform of some policy areas covered by the previous DPL, and it will consequently enjoy
the same level of inter-institutional coordination in terms of priorities and actions.
Principle 3: Customize the components and structure of the operation to country circumstances
The operation supports an important part of the Government’s reform program; the scope and sequencing of
PSDPL prior actions and targets are based on a realistic assessment of in-country capacity for completing the
reforms. This assessment was carried out in consultation with the Government. The DPL has been structured so as
to accompany the reform process to the next stage, it also has built-in flexibility to allow it to respond to any
internal or external changes which may shape the reform agenda.
Principle 4: Choose only results-based actions as conditions for disbursement
The policy matrix contains 9 prior actions for the PSDPL. These were identified following an assessment of their
importance for progress in the individual reform areas.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to performance-based financial support
The program matrix includes clearly defined outcome indicators, which have verified baseline values and can be
tracked through existing systems and processes.

B. Policy Areas
Component I: SOEs Oversight
56.      The Government program has made significant strides in addressing the SOEs
challenge by improving state oversight. The size and performance of SOEs represent a
significant challenge for Paraguay’s economy, from an institutional as well as from a political
economic point of view. The Government has therefore made SOEs oversight a priority in its
public sector reform program. Three main areas have been addressed: the institutional
framework for oversight of SOEs; financial transparency; and results-based management. Since
the end of 2008, the Government has achieved strong results, it has been assisted in its efforts
by the Bank (technical and financial assistance), by regional peer institutions, and by the
OECD. Given Paraguay’s track record in SOE reform, this could be viewed as a clear success
of the present government. Current achievements include the establishment of an effective
institutional framework; the attempt to consolidate this framework through the adoption of a
specific law; the publication of annual audited financial statements of SOEs; the adoption of
results-based agreements between SOEs and the State. The present section provides
information on sector challenges; implementation of the various aspects of the reform;
description of selected prior actions; and outcome indicators.



                                                       20
57.    SOE size and performance represent a significant challenge for Paraguay’s
economy and service delivery effectiveness. Paraguayan SOEs account for around 30 percent
of Public Sector expenditures and provide essential goods and services, including oil, water,
telecommunications and electricity. Their performance in terms of service delivery and
management could be significantly improved. For example, in 2010, only 43.5 percent of urban
households under the responsibility of the water SOE had sewage provision, electricity
production still experiences 32.6 percent technical loss. This poor performance is due, to a
large extent, to the institutional limitations that prevailed until 2008 and include: ineffective
oversight of the institutional framework, non-disclosure of audited financial statements,
asymmetric financial information and a partial regulatory framework for utilities.

Note: In 2010, SOE total expenditures represent the equivalent of 30 percent of public sector total expenditure and 62 percent
of Central Administration total expenditure.

58.     Beyond operational aspects, the SOE sector represented a challenge to the political
economy. Before the reform process, the political economy of SOE oversight was
characterized by fragmented responsibilities between different Government actors, with
overlapping functions and responsibilities. There was also asymmetric information between
SOE management on the one hand and Government and civil society on the other. There was
no available information on the performance or the financial situation of SOEs; there were
limited vertical accountability mechanisms; and a limited number of channels for civil society
participation in the oversight of SOEs. There was also no clear incentive for SOE management
to change the status quo.
59.     The Government designed a reform program for SOE oversight based on three
pillars: institutional framework; financial transparency; and results-based management.
Given the critical role of SOEs in Paraguay, the Government has targeted SOE oversight as one
of the key priorities of its public sector reform program. Reforms and measures in this area are
focused on three key aspects: (i) creating an adequate institutional framework for SOE


                                                             21
oversight and ownership based on regional examples and good practice; (ii) increasing
transparency by strengthening audit and financial management of SOEs and by publishing
annual financial statements; and (iii) introducing the fundamentals of results-based
management in the largest SOEs, with a view to improving service delivery performance.
60.      Factors that contributed to the success of this reform include: realism, flexibility,
identification of stakeholder consensus, and caution for political economy challenges.
First, over the last three years, the Government showed realism and pragmatism in
implementing this reform. Starting with a broader scope and more ambitious targets, the
program was narrowed down during the 2008-2009 crisis. In particular, it decided to focus
more exclusively on the oversight of SOEs reform and drop the establishment of an overall
regulatory model, given public sector technical capacities and the ability to handle the political
economy and institutional challenges. Second, the Government intended to generate consensus
around the reform of oversight of SOEs. This was achieved by, broad consultation on
institutional design and legal documents with international experts, peer institutions from the
region and OECD countries. Extensive communication with civil society, the Congress and the
media via conferences, press articles and dialogue with stakeholders was carried out. Finally,
with an inclusive and non-confrontational approach, the Government managed to progressively
gain support from SOE management and representatives from Congress.
Subcomponent Institutional Framework for State Oversight of SOEs
61.     The institutional settings established in 2008 include a supervisory body and a
technical monitoring unit, which defined the road-map for SOEs oversight. The Inter-
ministerial Council of SOEs (CEP) and the SOEs Monitoring Unit (UMEP) were established as
a result of a reform plan aimed at strengthening the institutionalization of SOEs ownership
function. In 2009, CEP’s inter-institutional board20 agreed on strategic priorities, which
included (i) improving financial management of SOEs; (ii) consolidating the institutional
framework for effective supervision of SOEs performance, investment plans, and aggregate
fiscal risk; (iii) aligning SOEs budget management to the Government’s fiscal program; and
(iv) providing adequate human resources and training to the Monitoring Unit. In this respect,
UMEP —the technical advisory body under CEP— was staffed by highly professional
personnel, paving the way for rapid progress in 2009-2011.
62.     During 2009-2011, progress was impressive on CEP/UMEP institutional
strengthening, given Paraguay’s context and structural constraints. In a background of
limited capacity and low-paced institutional responsiveness, the ability to combine CEP’s fast
inter-institutional decision-making capacity with the professional and technical monitoring of
UMEP created a responsive, technically-sound SOE supervisory body. The Board of CEP
meets every two weeks, and its agenda is jointly prepared by CEP’s executive secretary and
technical inputs provided by UMEP. CEP’s Board is able to make expedited executive
decisions, which are implemented and monitored by UMEP’s specialized staff. This process has
been sequenced through the design and follow-up of CEP multi-annual strategic plan.
63.    The professional quality and commitment of UMEP’s managerial and technical
staff have significantly contributed to the institutional strengthening of SOE oversight.

20
     The board of CEP includes the Ministers of Finance, Industry and Trade, and Public Works, as well as the State
     Attorney.


                                                         22
UMEP staff members are qualified, professional and highly motivated. One or two persons are
assigned to closely monitor each SOE, and have progressively developed technical knowledge,
thus becoming specialists in their assigned sectors. In 2009, UMEP’s staff received extensive
training in topics including financial analysis, procurement, management, negotiation, strategic
planning, and comparative experiences from other countries on SOE oversight.
64.     This institutional strengthening was guided and supported by the adoption of
UMEP’s functional manual in November 2010, selected as PSDPL prior action. Initially
started on an empirical basis and supported by Bank technical assistance, institutional
strengthening of the framework for oversight of SOEs was implemented through the
preparation of a series of strategic planning documents, and by the adoption by decree of
UMEP’s organizational and functional manual. This provided a clear definition of
responsibilities of UMEP’s management and staff, and also allowed UMEP to work with a
strategic focus.
65.     In addition, a draft law was submitted to Congress in December 2010 to strengthen
the sustainability of CEP/UMEP; this key measure was selected as PSDPL prior action.
Although the final outcome depends on the adoption by Congress, this measure is significant
and supports the Government commitment to sustain SOE oversight reform. It is a major step
in ensuring the continuity of the new institutional framework because the current decree, which
established CEP/UMEP could be more easily reversed In addition, this measure is substantial
for the following reasons:
      Ownership and commitment to institutional reform. The preparation of this draft law
       generated a very fruitful dialogue within the executive. It helped relevant actors take
       enhanced ownership of this reform and it increased awareness about the need to strengthen
       the sustainability of the institutional framework through the adoption of a new law.
      Gradual and consensus building law drafting. The draft law is simple and provides key
       definitions and scope for CEP/UMEP, while decrees and resolutions define detailed
       implementation. This is deliberate to ensure broader consensus and higher probability of
       adoption.
      Communication adapted to Context. As mentioned above, aspects of communication and
       political economy have been taken into account. The law was presented in December 2010,
       after disseminating information about the reform and working on building up a consensus,
       including through the organization of an international conference.
66.     The new law is expected to provide a stronger legal backing for CEP/UMEP than
current decrees. In the proposed law, the CEP will be denominated National Council of State-
Owned Enterprises (CNEP). The law will substitute the 2008 decree which established CEP,
and will specify CNEP’s composition, role, governing principles, and interaction with other
Government institutions. Like CEP, CNEP will be made up of the Ministers of Finance, Public
Works, Industry, and the State Attorney. It will organize the SOE portfolio to maximize the
achievement of SOEs objectives through the institutionalization of monitoring, evaluation and
control mechanisms.21 In a similar move, UMEP will be taking the title of General Directorate

21
     Specifically, CNEP will be in charge of (i) providing technical and strategic policy advice to the Government
     regarding the SOE portfolio; (ii) advising the President of the Republic in the appointment and removal of SOE
     directors; (iii) reviewing SOEs planning processes to ensure achievement of results; (iv) reviewing SOEs draft
     budgets; (v) promoting coordination between SOEs; and (vi) recommending the direct intervention on SOE


                                                         23
of State-Owned Enterprises (DGEP). It will continue to provide technical support to CNEP,
like UMEP with CEP now. The law is also confer on DGEP control activities that are currently
carried out by UMEP such as use of the balance scorecard control panel; review of SOEs audit
reports; and investment programs.
67.    The strategy for submitting the draft law aims at building consensus and takes into
account Paraguay Congress specifics, even though this requires a longer process. In
Paraguay, this type of law requires the sequential adoption by Senate and then by Chamber of
Deputies, but submission to the review of Congress Technical Commissions is not compulsory.
However, the Government decided to submit the draft to four internal Senate Committees22,
before the vote of the Senate, given that recommendations of approval by Commissions
contribute to a higher likelihood of enacting the draft. Favorable recommendations were
received from the Commissions of Finance in May 2011, and the Commission of Economy in
August 2011. Once the Senate will have adopted the draft law, the Government is planning to
submit it to 3 Commissions for the Chamber of Deputies, following a similar strategy.
Although this approach takes longer than a mere submission to Senate and Chamber of
Deputies, it generates a transparent and more thorough dialogue between Executive and
Legislative, which broadens the support for reforms and the probability of law adoption.
68.     These achievements have been obtained in a comparatively short period of time,
which sets the groundwork for a more ambitious medium-term strategy. This strategy is
building on prior actions, which included the provision of an enhanced legal backing for the
new organizational structure for CEP and UMEP, and to better define specific functions and
operational responsibilities for each management sector within UMEP, also clarification of
specific functions and operational responsibilities for each management sector within UMEP,
i.e, the planning and implementation of SOE monitoring mechanisms; oversight of the SOE
portfolio using management tools, planning, studies and regulation. This new organizational
framework will solidify institutional foundations to increase financial transparency and a
results-based management of SOEs, the two main goals of the Government Program.
Subcomponent Transparency, Audit, and Financial Management
69.      Since 2010, CEP has required SOEs to hire professional audit firms, to provide
these audits to UMEP, and to publish them; the implementation of these audits has been
selected as a prior action for this operation. While they had already initiated a collection of
existing audits of 2008 financial statements, CEP and UMEP requested independent annual
audits for SOEs in 2010; submission of financial reports to CEP and UMEP, and their
subsequent publication. UMEP also established an audit follow-up mechanism including field
visits, letters highlighting audit main findings and recommendations, also a warning report to
the Minister of Finance, if needed, to discuss the content in the next CEP meeting. Audited
financial statements of SOEs are published in the Ministry of Finance’s website.23 As of June
2011, all SOEs had already signed their respective external audit contracts for 2010 financial
statements with independent audit firms according to procedures established by UMEP and

   management to the President in extreme situations. It will comprise the Ministers of Finance, Public Works,
   Industry, and the State Attorney. The CEP will exert centralized institutional responsibilities on SOE oversight,
   and will be allowed to issue resolutions affecting the management of SOEs, as well as submit draft decrees for
   presidential approval.
22
   The selected Committees are: Finance, Economy, Public Works, and Legislation.

National Public Procurement Law (No.2051/03). Four have concluded and published their
audits, and the remaining four are expected to do so before the end of 2011.24 These measures
help to increase SOEs financial management soundness, and provide a venue for civil society
and the media to exert an additional oversight of SOEs.
70.    Addressing the question of State payment arrears to SOEs is another key
transparency and fiduciary initiative taken by the Government. By the end of 2009, four
main Paraguayan SOEs, responsible for the delivery of utilities and basic goods (ESSAP,
ANDE, COPACO and PETROPAR) claimed cumulated payment arrears by the Central
Administration in the amount of US$110 million.25 The Central Administration had indeed
budgetary problems to ensure timely payments to SOEs for services rendered, and the Ministry
of Finance considered this as a priority for the state governance of SOEs.
71.      In 2010, preliminary steps were taken to set up an inter-institutional commission
to validate the debt amount; those were selected as a prior actions. As a result of the SOEs
claim, CEP created an inter-institutional technical commission in 2010 to calculate accurate,
legitimate estimates on accrued debits and credits held between the SOEs and Central
Administration. By June 2011, 99 percent of payment arrears between SOEs and Central
Administration had been validated.26 The Government is considering different options to
include repayment mechanisms within the budget in order to reduce the accrued debt by 50
percent within the next two years. Although there may be a risk that this type of debt repayment
mechanism could be achieved by methods such as increasing subsidies. This risk is however,
considered to be unrealistic since the Government has shown strong commitment to leading
this initiative, and the current efforts to increase transparency is mitigating this risk.
72.     As of 2010, the Government established budget mechanisms to ensure Central
Administration’s timely payment to SOEs for public services, which has been selected as
prior action. Under the leadership of CEP, UMEP has collected and analyzed monthly SOEs
invoices to public sector entities. Resources for utility services have been budgeted on the basis
of these estimates. As a result, a 2008-2010 comparison between budgeted and out-turn data
extracted by the integrated accountancy system of SIAF (SICO) indicates a clear increase in the
timely payment of basic services provided by ESSAP, COPACO and ANDE by Central
Administration entities. Specifically, payment of SOE-provided services jumped from 27
percent in 2008 to 87 percent by 2010.
73.     The selected prior actions of this subcomponent strongly support key outcome
indicators related to SOEs financial transparency. Indicators for this subcomponent
measure (i) the transparency of SOEs financial operations; (ii) the timely delivery of audit
reports; (iii) SOEs recovery ratio of payment arrears; and (iv) the rate of increase of timely
payment for public services by the Central Administration. There is a strong link between these


24
    The improvement of timeliness and quality of audit reports is a medium-to-long term objective. Time and
   further institutional development of UMEP and CEP will be critical in order to sustain this process and achieve
   even greater SOE financial transparency and control. It is expected that audit timeliness will progressively
   improve due to the adoption and acceptance of practices such as annual audits of SOEs financial statements; and
   UMEP follow-up of those audits.
25
   According to SOEs reported data, collected by the UMEP.
26
    Validation requires the certified agreement between the SOE, the corresponding entity of the Central
   Administration, and an independent consulting firm hired to calculate outstanding payment arrears.


                                                       25
indicators and the prior actions of this subcomponent, all support transparency and sound
financial management of SOEs.
Subcomponent SOEs Results-Based Management
74.     The Government Program also aimed to introduce a results-based framework, to
help increase SOEs performance in service delivery. The Government’s strategy included
the introduction of performance management contracts and setting up a new accountability
mechanism, which involved CEP and the President itself. This was enhanced by technological
capabilities within UMEP to monitor indicators on SOEs performance.
75.    The CEP made important progress in monitoring the performance of SOEs
through the introduction of results-based management contracts, which serve as prior
action for this operation. UMEP defined a standardized model of SOE performance
management contract and identified a monitoring approach. CEP worked with five major
SOEs—representing around 80 percent of total SOE-consolidated expenditures— to agree on
their medium-term strategic objectives and targets. 27 The standardized three-year performance
management contract signed between CEP and each SOE typically includes targets for service
delivery, and financial and treasury business services. It is usually jointly prepared by technical
teams from each SOE and UMEP. Contract provisions also include monthly and quarterly
monitoring mechanisms, as well as the fulfillment of annual audit requirements.
76.     UMEP recently established a balanced scorecard monitoring SOEs’ economic,
financial and technical performance; this measure has been selected as prior action.
UMEP developed an automated tool providing an online connection with SOEs management
systems and producing a dashboard matrix of around 20 indicators for each SOE under a
performance management contract. For each indicator, the dashboard provides targets and a
regular progress update, potential underperformance can be flagged and SOEs performance is
regularly monitored. Performance information from this dashboard system is reported to CEP
and the President of Republic, and helps to improve decision-making and performance
assessment processes.
77.    A high-level accountability mechanism has been established to complement the
monitoring of SOEs performance. A high-level meeting made up of CEP and Heads of SOEs
meets quarterly to examine targets agreed in SOEs’ performance contracts. A status report is
subsequently prepared and submitted to the President of Republic who calls a meeting of CEP
and Heads of SOE to discuss their results. This framework provides a very powerful
accountability mechanism for performance, and it is expected that these measures will
contribute to the medium term objective of improving SOE service delivery by increasing
managerial responsiveness to the Government’s priorities.
78.     The selected prior actions of this subcomponent strongly support the key outcome
indicators related to the introduction of SOE results-based management. The indicators for
this subcomponent measure (i) implementation of a set of performance indicators and their
regular monitoring; and (ii) public service performance in terms of number of hours of power
outage per year; water access coverage by ESSAP; percentage of user complaints to the water
company ESSAP; and time required to install fixed telephone lines. The selected prior actions

27
     ANDE, COPACO, ESSAP, INC, and PETROPAR had signed their performance management contracts during
     2009- 2010.


                                                  26
have been instrumental in designing and monitoring these indicators: these indicators were
determined by the results-based management contracts and the balanced scorecards allow for
regular and effective monitoring by UMEP.
                      Box 2: Prior Actions and Key Outcome Indicators – SOEs Oversight
 Institutional Framework for Government Ownership of State Enterprises
 Prior Actions
  The Government has strengthened the institutional framework associated with SOE management through: (i)
      the submission to Congress of a law draft proposing the legal establishment of the CEP and the UMEP
      Completed; and (ii) the approval by CEP of the UMEP’s Organizational-Operational Manual. Completed.
 Transparency, Audit, & Financial Management
 Prior Actions
  CEP ensures greater transparency in SOE management via implementation of annual external audits,
    elaborated according to CEP standards. Completed.
  The Government has developed a strategy to liquidate expenditure payment arrears and ensure timely
    payment of basic services by Central Administration entities to SOEs, which includes: (i) the creation of an
    Inter-institutional Technical Commission made up of the Ministry of Finance, the State Attorney General, and
    the SOEs. Completed; (ii) the validation of expenditure payment arrears between Central Administration and
    the SOEs. Completed; and (ii) the Government has established specific mechanisms to ensure timely payment
    of services provided by SOEs to Central Administration entities. Completed.
 Key Outcome Indicators
  SOEs financial operations are carried out in a transparent manner and are subject to scrutiny by the
    Government and civil society. Target: online publishing of SOEs audited financial statements.
  Timely delivery of SOEs audited financial statements. Target: SOEs audited financial statements are available
    no later than June 30 of the following year.
  Recovery of 20% of the past-due debt accumulated by Central Administration entities with SOEs. (Baseline
    2010: 0% of the certified aggregated amount of debt was reimbursed (Gs.365 billion).
  Rate of timely payments reaches 80% for basic services provided to the State by SOEs (Electricity,
    Telecommunication, and Water). (Baseline Jan-Jun 2010: 51%)
 SOE’s Results-Based Management
 Prior Actions
  The Government has introduced a results-based framework, aimed at increasing SOEs’ service delivery
    capacities. At least 5 SOEs, representing around 80% of consolidated SOE expenditures, have signed their
    respective performance management contracts, which include standardized management procedures and
    financial targets. Completed.
  UMEP has recently established a balanced scorecard that connects it directly to SOEs’ economic, financial
    and technical follow-up indicators. Completed.
 Key Outcome Indicators
  At least 5 SOEs have established targets that can be monitored on a regular basis by UMEP.
  The number of hours of power outage as measured by hs/year per user has dropped to 11 hours (Baseline:
    2010: 11.2 hs/year per user)
  The coverage of ESSAP water access as measured by the percentage of households in urban areas with access
    to water has increased to 89.2% (Baseline January 2010: 79.4%).
  The percentage of user complaints to ESSAP has decreased to 18% (Baseline 2010: 19%).
  Installation time for fixed telephone lines has decreased to 17 days (Baseline 2010: 20 days)

79.     Overall, the Government is on track to achieve the medium-term outcome
indicators. First, publication and dissemination of SOEs annual audited financial statements
are already in place. The Government has also successfully elaborated standard rules and
procedures pursuing the contracting of independent audit firms. Second, the recent validation of
Central Administration utility payment arrears, and the establishment of an inter-institutional
technical commission indicates progress towards their gradual cancellation. Third, significant
advances have also been made in timely payment of these services. Finally, the definition of
medium-term financial and performance targets for the five major SOEs, representing almost


                                                      27
80 percent of total SOE-consolidated expenditures, is expected to have a medium-term impact
on the efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery. Outcome indicators on service
delivery in specific sectors were chosen to further incentivize the continuation of monitoring
efforts, even if targeted improvements are not large as for example in the electricity sector.
Challenges Ahead and Medium Term Framework
80.     For the next two years, challenges ahead are focused on consolidating
achievements through enhancing sustainability and further improving audit timeliness.
Continuous capacity building combined with the adoption of the law consolidating the
oversight institutional framework could contribute to achieving sustainable results.
Furthermore, feasible improvements could be achieved in financial transparency of SOEs. The
delivery of audit reports is still experiencing significant delays, although the Government has
achieved publication of audited SOEs’ financial statements. Delivery of audit reports could be
the next target for the Government in improving transparency of SOEs management. Achieving
sustained adequate payment of services to SOEs, and netting payment arrears would be
important achievements, and would provide a positive conclusion to the current phase of
reform of SOE oversight.
81.    Over the longer term, efficient service delivery and transparency in Paraguay
would benefit from strengthening the regulatory framework and the auditing profession.
The Government has achieved limited progress on strengthening the regulatory framework.
Given capacity constraints and the technical and political complexity of this topic, this issue
could be contemplated on a medium-term perspective. Similarly, strengthening the accounting
and auditing profession in Paraguay could contribute to a stronger control environment.
Component II: Central Administration Internal Financial Control
82.     Improving the effectiveness of Central Administration’s internal financial control
is a priority of the Government Public Sector Program. Given the ineffectiveness of internal
control procedures and the limited institutional capacities, the Government believes that
addressing these issues would help improve accountability and ensure that funds are used for
their intended purposes. It believes that it would further contribute to the enhancement of the
public sector’s overall reliability and credibility.
83.     Prevailing internal control procedures were ineffective during the first half of the
2000s. The control framework for payroll was limited by the absence of a proper payroll
calculation system, and there was a high risk that payroll calculations from spending units did
not reflect the actual number of days worked by civil servants. In the case of non-salary
expenditures, internal control constituted a mere formality and relied exclusively on the
spending units’ systems. This was compounded by the absence of a norm enabling
implementation of the integrated system for goods and services (SIABYS) and also by a lack of
integration between the different systems that made up the integrated state resources
management system (SIARE). 28
84.    Despite reform efforts, it has been challenging to establish internal control and
audit systems effectively in the public sector in Paraguay. While the 1999 Financial

28
     The SIARE includes the SIAF for PFM, the SINARH for human resources, and the SIABYS. However, the
     latter still lacks a legal framework, indispensable for the reinforcement of the existing procurement system.


                                                         28
Administration Law established public sector internal control systems, internal audit
institutional framework was established by decree in 2001. By 2005-2006 their operational
effectiveness remained limited. First, the institutional capacities of both the Internal Audit
Office (Auditoría General del Poder Ejecutivo - AGPE) and the spending units’ Internal Audit
Units (AIIs) were undermined by organizational limitations and a lack of well-trained
personnel. Second, there was an absence of internal audit manuals and standardized norms, as
well as any legally defined sanctions regime. AIIs were insufficiently staffed, and experience
and skills were not always adequate. Recruitment procedures were not based on competitive
processes and job requirements were not properly defined.
85.     In 2007-2008, Paraguay Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (Report No. 44007-PY)
identified internal audit as a key public financial management challenge, which triggered
Government and IFIs reaction. The report observed that the coverage and quality of the
internal audit function was negatively affected by the absence of systems and methodology;
there were issues with the frequency and the distribution of reports; and internal audit
recommendations were usually ignored. As a result, the Government initiated a program
focusing on the expansion of financial management information systems; the implementation
of a standardized internal control framework and strengthening of the internal audit function;
and the improvement of the control environment through strengthening and harmonization of
the financial and administration directorates of spending units.
86.    Subsequently, the Government decided to strengthen the internal audit function,
with the help of the Umbral Program. Achievements made towards strengthening the internal
audit function included: the adoption of a decree in late 2007 which redefined the role,
organization and attributions of the AGPE; increase of AGPE’s human resource capacity; and
delivery of intensive training and development jointly with the Supreme Audit Institution of a
Government audit manual.
87.      After the 2008 presidential elections, internal control remains a priority, and a
standardized internal control called MECIP framework was adopted. This framework was
introduced by Decree 962/08, and aimed at sustaining the continued improvement of public
institutions by strengthening internal control practices and capabilities. Using a systemic and
unifying approach, MECIP introduced the basis for a permanent control structure within the
country’s public entities and its underlying principles.
88.    These actions were critical to further strengthen the internal control framework
and the internal audit function throughout the Central Administration. The USAID-
supported Umbral program provided technical assistance and intensive training to ensure
adequate and gradual implementation of MECIP. In a first phase, implementation support
focused on five ministries,29 the General Comptroller’s Office and the Internal Audit Office
(AGPE). The second phase of the Umbral Program, initiated in 2010, extended to five other
key Central Administration institutions.30
89.    Advances in the effectiveness of the Central Administration’s internal and
financial control are already very significant. AGPE has notably expanded its coverage,


29
     Ministries of Agriculture, Finance, Public Works, Health, and Education.
30
     The additional five institutions were the Ministry of the Interior, National Congress, Office of the Attorney
     General, the Supreme Court, and the National Customs Office.

increasing the institutions being audited from 70 to 100 between 2008 and 2009. At the same
time, the quality of internal control has increased, as shown by the following achievements:
      On average, the level of implementation of Institutional Audit Units’ work plans increased
       from 74 to 77 percent between 2009 and 2010, reports are regularly issued and submitted to
       relevant authorities.
      On average, the level of implementation of Self-Improvement Plans aimed to address
       weaknesses detected by internal and external controls increased from 57 to 64.5 percent
       between 2009 and 2010.
      On average, the percentage of recommendations made by internal and external auditors that
       have been successfully addressed increased from 48 to 69.5 percent between 2009 and 2010.
      A comprehensive set of internal procedures (MECIP) has been implemented in the central
       administration, and contributed to strengthening administrative integrity and effectiveness.
      No penalties are applied to institutions lagging behind in the implementation of MECIP or
       their self-improvement plans, or if they fail to address the observations made by internal
       and external auditors. However, on a semi-annual basis the AGPE presents an Internal
       Control Report to the President of Paraguay, who, in turn, discusses it with the heads of the
       institutions and government entities. This practice has resulted in heightened visibility of
       financial management and increased accountability for compliance with internal controls.
90.      Throughout 2010, the gradual implementation of MECIP made solid advances,
and MECIP adoption and deepening was selected as a prior action for this operation.
Around 2,000 Government civil servants from the 12 institutions that are part of the Umbral
program received training and technical assistance for the implementation of MECIP.
Meanwhile, MECIP implementation and development in the five original ministries has been
pursued.31 Overall, 50 training sessions and workshops were delivered to higher management
staff, internal auditors, MECIP implementation teams and, as part of a train-the-trainer module,
to staff from the Comptroller’s Office and the AGPE.

91.   These improvements are reflected in the 2011 PEFA, showing an upward trend in
Paraguay’s internal control and auditing, and confirming that the achievement of the

outcome indicator is likely. The overall rating for PI-20 (Effectiveness of internal controls
over non-personnel expenditures) and PI-21 (Effectiveness of the internal audit) is expected to
be C for the ongoing 2010 PEFA assessment.32 Significant improvements observed in the areas
of internal control and internal audit have allowed for an increase in the PEFA score for these
two indicators from the D+ rating obtained in the same indicators for the 2008 IFA. PI-20 score
increased because internal control procedures and rules are more comprehensive, thanks to the
introduction of MECIP. PI-21 score increased because of a higher coverage of a more effective
internal audit function, and a higher extent of management response to internal audit findings.

Challenges Ahead and Medium Term Framework
92.     Further implementation of MECIP will require time, as well as continuous
political and financial support. MECIP is expected to gradually introduce a series of activities
in addition to human resources training. These will include the design of institutional and
operative plans and programs, and the development of policies based on risk analysis and
citizenship accountability. Further, MECIP is intended to be implemented gradually throughout
the Paraguayan public sector, which is a fairly ambitious goal given the baseline status of
standard internal control practices in the country. Strong political and financial support will be
required to achieve this. The recent upgrading of the Office of the Executive’s Internal Auditor
(AGPE) to ministerial level, accompanied by a significant increase of its budget and intensive
human resources training shows that there is the political will to support this matter.
  Box 3: Prior Actions and Key Outcome Indicators - Central Administration Internal Financial Control
 Prior Actions
  Five ministries, representing approximately 70% of Central Administration’s overall budget, have
    established internal control committees, internal control norms, and have trained staff to implement the
    MECIP. Their respective internal audit units (AIIs) have an adequate number of employees Completed.
 Key Outcome Indicators
  PEFA Indicators for internal control and internal audit (PI-20 and PI-21) for 50% of the ministries are rated
    C, which shows: (i) A more comprehensive set of internal control rules, and (ii) A broader coverage and
    quality of internal audit function and a higher extent of management response to internal audit findings.

     The 2010 PEFA was funded and implemented by the EU with a joint quality control from EU, World Bank and
     IADB. The 2010 draft report has already been reviewed by the three institutions and the PEFA Secretariat. It has
     been submitted to the Government, and is in the process of being published. EU representatives gave their
     agreement to the disclosure of the 2010 PEFA rating for indicators PI20 and 21 and the text of this footnote.

Component III: Tax System
93.     The Government has achieved significant progress in reforming the tax system,
particularly addressing the key challenge of low tax revenue. Paraguay’s tax-to-GDP ratio
reached an average of 12 percent of GDP between 2004 and 2009, up from 9 percent in the
1990s. The current tax-to-GDP ratio still represents one of the lowest ratios in the region and
only 51 percent of its estimated tax potential.33 As a result, expenditures including social
expenditures are lower in Paraguay than in most Latin American neighbors and public service
delivery is lagging. To address low tax revenues, the Government implemented a
comprehensive tax reform in 2004 aimed at simplifying and increasing the efficiency of the
Paraguayan tax system. As a result the active tax payer base and revenues increased. More
recently, the Government has shifted its reform effort to increasing the efficiency of its large
tax payers unit. This is another important step as it allows for further increases in tax revenues
in the medium term and also allows for pilot reforms which can be rolled out to other parts of
the tax base. Despite achievements, challenges remain and require continued reform effort.
94.     Paraguay’s tax system is characterized by a number of structural challenges that
limit the state’s ability to raise revenues. The system relies heavily on indirect taxes and is
characterized by structural and political obstacles to improve tax equity. Indirect taxes –
primarily the VAT, excise taxes and customs duties – account for 80 percent of tax collections.
The corporate income tax (IRACIS) is the only significant direct tax in Paraguay, accounting
for around 16 percent of total tax collection. Indirect taxes tend to be more regressive than
direct taxes.34 Structural and political obstacles are clearly demonstrated by the light taxation of
the agriculture sector and the still outstanding introduction of a personal income tax. The
agricultural sector still only generates around 0.2 percent of total tax revenue despite
accounting for around 20 percent of GDP, as it benefits from VAT exemptions on its
agricultural products.35 The introduction of a personal income tax has so far not passed
Congress. In addition, Paraguay’s tax system also suffers from a widespread culture of tax
evasion associated with the informal economy.
95.      Relevance and significance of changes to Paraguay’s tax system have to be
evaluated in the light of the country’s political economy challenges. The ability to reform
the tax system may be affected by overall public sector limitations, the role of Congress, and
the potential resistance from interest groups. The delay in implementing personal income tax
illustrates these challenges, the adoption of the draft law was postponed several times by
Congress in recent years. It became effective in January 2010, but has been postponed once
again by Congress until 2013.
96.     In 2004, the Government initiated a comprehensive tax reform aimed at
simplifying the tax system and increasing its efficiency. As a first step the Government
approved the Fiscal Adjustment Law, which consisted of ambitious reform measures to
strengthen tax policy. The main objectives of the reforms were to formalize economic activity
and to gradually increase the progressiveness of the Paraguayan tax system. Changes in tax
policy included: the broadening of the tax base for VAT and for agricultural income tax

(IMAGRO) through the elimination of several loopholes and exemptions; the increase of rates
and number of excises; and the introduction of two new income taxes: the personal income tax
and an income tax for small corporate taxpayers. Corporate income tax rates were reduced from
30 percent to 10 percent over a two-year period, and the base for this tax was broadened.
97.     Meanwhile the Government also engaged in a range of tax administration
measures designed to boost tax revenues. In a first phase of the modernization of the
Paraguayan tax administration, the Undersecretariat of Taxes (SET) adopted an information
technology platform that supports core tax administration processes such as taxpayer register,
single taxpayer account, and tax returns processing. This has been rolled out to its regional
offices. In addition, services to taxpayers have improved: there is now telephone assistance and
online access. As a result of these significant measures, the number of active individual
taxpayers increased from 200,243 in 2005 to 408,656 in 2010; and the number of active
registered corporations increased from 24,248 in 2005 to 48,998 in 2010, i.e., it has more than
doubled in five years.
98.      More recently, reform focus has shifted towards improving the performance of the
large taxpayer unit (LTU), given this segment’s importance in terms of revenue and tax
compliance risk. LTU reform is critical because it may lead to significant tax revenue yields
and can be used to pilot key processes that can be rolled out to other taxpayer segments and
functional areas. In Paraguay, the 500 largest taxpayers contribute almost 80 percent of total tax
collections and the largest 100 account for more than half of all tax collections. 36 Focusing
reforms on the efficiency of the LTU is therefore indicated. Around the world LTUs have
become an increasingly strategic organizational tool to initiate the reform of low-performing
tax administrations.37 The Government’s focus on large tax payers shows its commitment to
shift from improving basic core processes to a second generation of reforms. The reforms of the
audit function of large tax payers in the LTUs can later on be rolled out to the rest of the tax
base. Tax administration in Paraguay has traditionally been weak, especially with regards to
audit and control functions, and recent focus on the LTU has opened an important window to
effectively begin addressing this challenge.
99.     Strengthening the LTU’s audit capacity is a key component of this reform effort
and has been selected as prior action for this operation. The Government implemented two
measures in this context: in 2010 SET issued a joint resolution with the Superintendencia de
Bancos allowing the audit of financial institutions, for the first time, including those classified
as large taxpayers.38 In addition, it implemented a training program for auditors of the LTU. In
an environment where low capacity has constrained the Government’s ability to perform its
audit and control function, basic training is a significant first step.
100. The increase in tax audits performed by the LTU in 2009-2010 represents a second
significant step, and has also been selected as a prior action. The SET managed to double
the number of audits on large taxpayers from 20 in 2008 to 40 in 2009. In 2010, a total of 32
audits on large taxpayers were initiated, including 2 highly specialized cases.39 The relevance

of this step becomes even more apparent in the light of several years without audits due to a
lack of transparency and adequately trained auditors.
101. In 2009-2010, the Government complemented LTU reforms with issuing tax-
compliance certificates; another prior action for this operation. The measure of issuing
certificates is an important reform step towards transparency and tax compliance.40 The
authorities demonstrated their commitment by issuing 122,609 certificates in 2009, and another
280,105 in 2010. Certificates can easily be requested either on-line (accessing the tax
management system Marangatu) or at SET customer-service platforms. An important feature
of the certificates is that taxpayers with payment arrears or delays in the submission of their tax
statements are not eligible for the certificate. These certificates are mainly required as a pre-
condition for engaging in contracts with the public sector.
102. Other recent reforms include increasing the number of VAT-withholding agents
and revising tax incentives and exemptions. Other reform measures include increasing the
number of VAT-withholding agents designated by the tax authority - usually exporters and
other large businesses - from 98 in 2008 to 754 in 2010. This has lead to a substantial increase
in tax collection.41 Furthermore, the SET started reviewing the current system of tax incentives
and exemptions, by targeting specific sectors. Most notably: (i) The General Directorate of Tax
Audit reviewed 22 requests for VAT credits claimed against the agricultural income tax
(IMAGRO) in 2009, amounting to Gs.58 billion; (ii) the SET included five companies under
the maquila regime in the internal control process in 2010; and (iii) the SET specified
procedures required for determining tax refunds, according to current legal dispositions.42
103. The selected prior actions strongly support the key outcome indicators of the tax
component of the reform plan, which are well on track for completion. Key outcome
indicators for the tax component are that (i) the tax-to-GDP ratio remain above 14 percent; (ii)
the ratio of stop-filers among large tax payers has to remain below 3 percent; and (iii) the ratio
of audits of large tax payers that result in additional assessment exceeds 70 percent.43 The
improvement of capacity and execution of audit at the LTU and the issuance of tax-compliance
certificates are likely to generate higher tax revenues in the medium term. The tax-to-GDP ratio
is not an optimal indicator of the Government’s tax effort for two reasons. First, the supported
reforms will take time to translate into higher tax revenues as they are geared to improve basic
core processes which take time to yield results. Second, many factors influence the tax-to-GDP
ratio which does not exclusively measure the results of the supported reforms. A better
indicator would be an estimate of the tax gap. However, such measure is unrealistic in the
context of Paraguay with its capacity constraints. To keep track of the tax effort, therefore the
tax-to-GDP ratio is the best available measure and is complemented with additional measures.
The stop-filer ratio reflects the efficiency of audit and control, as the incentive to not present
income tax decreases with a higher probability of detection. In addition, the rate of audits that
result in additional assessment reflects the efficiency of the selection process of the audits.

40
   In the years 2008 and 2009 SET published three resolutions (―Resoluciones Generales‖ from SET 8/08, 16/09
   and 23/09) introducing the requirement of tax-compliance certificates associated with the issuance of car license
   plates, registration of real estate, etc.

Challenges Ahead and Medium Term Framework
104. Despite progress achieved over the past five years, improving the tax system
remains a challenge for reform in Paraguay. A favorable trend was clearly observed over the
past few years, seen in the significant increase in the number of active taxpayers; the gradual
decentralization of tax services; and the upgrading of computational and management
technologies. However, continued effort is needed to further improve tax administration and tax
policy in the medium- to long-term. Concretely, efficiency of the LTU unit needs to improve
further. Most importantly, an LTU strategy is needed for specialized training in advanced audit
methods, international taxation, and particular sectors. In addition, audit selection needs to be
improved to take into account risk criteria. Furthermore, pilot reforms for large tax payers have
to be rolled out to medium sized tax payers. Finally, introducing a personal income tax (IRP)
remains an outstanding reform effort that would potentially contribute to increased tax revenue
and improved equity and transparency of the tax system.
                        Box 4: Prior Actions and Key Outcome Indicators - Tax System
 Prior Actions
  SET has strengthened its audit capacities for large taxpayers through: (i) the issuance of a resolution by SET
    and the Superintendencia de Bancos to allow for the audit of financial institutions classified as large
    taxpayers. Completed; and (ii) the implementation of a training program for auditors from the large taxpayers
    unit (DGGC). Completed.
  SET has significantly increased the number of large taxpayers subject to tax audits (Baseline: 2008= 20)
    through: (i) 40 audits in 2009 Completed; (ii) 32 specialized audits of large enterprises in 2010, including two
    highly specialized ones. Completed.
  Tax Certificates. SET issued 122,609 tax-compliance certificates in 2009, and 280,105 certificates in
    2010.Completed.
 Key Outcome indicator:
  Tax-to-GDP ratio is at least at 13.8%. (Baseline 2010:13.4 percent)
  Ratio of audits of large tax payers that result in additional assessment exceeds 70%. (Baseline 2010: 55%)


                               VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
A. Poverty and Social Impacts
105. The actions supported under the PSDPL are expected to entail indirect positive
poverty and social impacts. While the operation does not directly address social sector
reforms, the supported reforms on the oversight and management of SOEs and of the tax
system are likely to generate indirect positive impacts. In contrast, the reforms on improving
central administration internal financial control are likely to have a negligible effect on poverty
reduction and social matters.
106. Improving the oversight and management of SOEs is likely to positively impact the
delivery of basic services, thereby improving the living standard of the poor. SOEs in
Paraguay provide basic services like water, sanitation, electricity, and are involved in the
provision of commodities such as petrol and diesel fuel. Access to electricity and clean water is
not universal in Paraguay. Around 98 percent of households had access to electricity in 2008,
although in many cases this entailed intermittent access of a few hours per day. The number of
households with clean water amounted only to 68 percent in 2007.44 Improved SOE oversight

is likely to increase the efficiency of public service delivery and as a consequence has the
potential to increase number of households with electricity and particularly clean water. In
addition, higher efficiency of the state owned petrol processing SOE, PETROPAR, is likely to
lower production cost and hence lead to a decrease in petrol and diesel fuel prices for end
consumers. These are important cost factors for public transportation, which is extensively used
by the poor. Improved use of public funds also has the potential to free up resources for the
Government’s pro-poor policies.
107. The Government has demonstrated its commitment to improving social inclusion
and benefiting the poor with the help of SOEs. The Government has initiated concrete
measures in the SOE sector e.g., the Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization Project (Loan
No. 7710-PY) supported by the World Bank. Another example is the Government’s focus on
large users in the electricity sector, where higher efficiency of SOE oversight of is expected to
generate higher revenues. This will allow maintaining current tariffs for the next five years, a
measure that ensures that the poor will not be negatively impacted.
108. Tax system reforms are expected to positively impact poverty reduction and social
development indicators through maintaining macroeconomic stability and increasing
social sector spending. In the medium term the supported tax system reforms are likely to help
the Government generate higher tax revenues. This will help to maintain macroeconomic
stability and free public sector resources.
109. The Government has demonstrated strong commitment to social sector
development with the help of social expenditure during recent years. Additional resources
generated with the help of the tax system reform are likely to contribute to social sector
development given the Government’s commitment to the social agenda in recent years, as part
of the Government’s Strategic Economic and Social Plan. In the crisis year 2009 social
expenditures grew by 26 percent relative to the previous year, representing 51 percent of total
expenditure or 11 percent of GDP. In 2010, social expenditures increased by further 6 percent,
representing 50 percent of total expenditure, or 9.5 percent of GDP.
110. In particular, the expansion of the Government’s conditional cash transfer
program (CCT) Tekoporá has benefited the poor. The number of beneficiaries increased
from 13,679 in 2008, to 83,106 in 2010, and as of March 2011, reached 98,653. An incidence
analysis using micro-simulations carried out in the context of the World Bank’s 2010 poverty
assessment indicates that 80 percent of the beneficiaries of Paraguay’s CCT programs would be
concentrated within the poorest 15 percent of the population if the CCT’s targeting instrument
were perfectly implemented. No beneficiary of CCT programs would be found in the upper half
of the income distribution.45 46
B. Environmental Aspects
111. The specific policies supported by the PSDPL are not expected to significantly
impact the environment, forests or other natural resources. The policies are limited to
monitoring the performance of SOE’s and no direct investments are supported. The

45
   Micro-simulations were used due to the lack of information on coverage of the CCT program in the Permanent
   Household Survey in 2008.

environmental licensing and management of SOE’s is regulated under Paraguay’s
environmental institutional and policy framework as defined under Laws 1561 of 2000, 3679 of
2008 (institutional framework), and Law 294 of 1993 (on environmental assessment) among
others. The institutional framework consists of the Secretariat for Environment (SEAM) and
the National Environment Council which are responsible for defining environmental policy and
monitoring the environment as defined by Law 1561.
112. SEAM has limited capacity and insufficient coordination with other ministries and
SOE's in regard to infrastructure projects, especially in the areas of water and electricity.
These shortcomings may result in delays at planning, licensing, and construction stages which
could have an impact on overall efficiency in the provision of public services. However, the
Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization (P095235, Loan No. 7710-PY) includes a specific
sub-component to strengthen the Water Resources and the Environmental Licensing
Directorates of SEAM. In addition, to the extent that improvements in the management of
SOEs supported by the PSDPL are successful, Paraguay’s national institutional capacity to
identify and address environmental policy and regulatory issues will be strengthened. The
Energy Sector Strengthening Project (P114971, Loan No. 7994-PY) includes capacity
strengthening for ANDE that aims to improve capacity for environmental assessment and
management of potential impacts from infrastructure investments in this sector.
C. Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation
113. The Paraguayan Government has agreed to regularly monitor progress under the
PSDPL. The Bank and the Ministry of Finance agreed on the relevance of establishing
effective monitoring and evaluation activities to ensure adequate follow up of PSDPL
implementation. The Government is carrying out these activities using two interrelated
channels. First, the Under-Secretariat of Economics and Integration (SSEI) from the Ministry
of Finance is responsible for coordinating implementation and monitoring activities of this
DPL. Second, the institution responsible47 for each policy area is accountable for achieving
relevant prior actions.
114. The Government and the Bank will use the following data sources to assess
progress under the PSDPL program:
      Public sector budget monitoring and execution reports from the Ministry of Finance,
       including reports on revenue collection.
      Economic Team’s quarterly monitoring reports of the implementation of the Strategic
       Economic and Social Plan (2008-13).
      Financial plan execution report from the Ministry of Finance.
      Central Bank reports and analysis of key macroeconomic variables.
      Reviews and analyses of laws and implementing regulations from the World Bank and
       other stakeholders.
      Government Internal audit reports.
      Reports by the Council for SOEs.
      World Bank supervision missions and reports.
      World Bank DPL Implementation Completion Report (to be prepared upon project closure).

47
     These institutions are: CEP for the SOE Component; AGPE for the Internal Audit Component; and SET for the
     Tax Component.


                                                       37
D. Fiduciary Aspects
115. According to the IFA48, Paraguay’s public financial management (PFM) remains
weak and represents a high risk. The three main PFM challenges are related to improvements
in: budget process efficiency; fiscal transparency; and control effectiveness. 49 The common
features underlying each of these challenges is their connection to Paraguay’s political and
institutional context and the difficulty in addressing their technical dimension without adopting
broader governance changes.50
116. The Government remains committed to addressing PFM and particularly control
effectiveness issues. This commitment is most clearly evidenced in (i) the reforms recently
initiated with the assistance of USAID programs Umbral I and II, and (ii) through outcomes
reached through the 2009 Programmatic DPL, including prior actions agreed within the
framework of PSDPL, aimed at strengthening effectiveness of public financial control.
117. The latest IMF safeguards assessment of foreign exchange control environment of
the Central Bank of Paraguay was performed in October 2006. The report states that while
the Central Bank has made some progress in strengthening the safeguard framework since the
2003 safeguard assessment, vulnerabilities remain in areas such as financial and program data
reporting to the Fund. However, according to the assessment, the current foreign exchange
control environment within the Central Bank is satisfactory. An unqualified audit opinion of the
Central Bank financial statements for the year 2010 has been published. The auditors reported a
deviation from the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on the Financial
Statements that according to the auditors could result in material adjustments if IFRS were fully
adopted. However, based on the review of the audited financial statements and previous DPL
external audit report, nothing came to the attention of the Bank that would indicate that the
BCP control environment into which the loan proceeds will flow is other than adequate under
the proposed arrangements. Arrangements are in place to mitigate identified risks.

Budget Transparency
118. The annual budget is publicly accessible through the Ministry of Finance’ website.
In the fiscal year 2009, the Ministry of Finance also issued a quarterly report on budget
execution, which was published on their website.51 Furthermore, the audited annual financial
statements are submitted to Congress and being made public subsequent to their approval.
E. Disbursements and Auditing
119. The Bank would make the single loan disbursement to a dedicated account that
forms part of the country's official foreign exchange reserves at the Central Bank of
Paraguay. The disbursement would be made upon the Bank's assessment on satisfactory
compliance of prior actions agreed and compliance with the adequacy of the Borrower’s
macroeconomic policy framework. Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases

49
   More recent analytical work on Paraguay PFM lead by the European Commission (EC) is underway and the
   report has not yet been issued.
50
    As indicated in the Economic Context Section of this document, governance and public sector efficiency
   encounter broad challenges related in particular with discretionary practices, politicization and lack of
   transparency in the public sector as well as economic informality.

and no procurement requirements would be needed. Once the Loan is approved by the Board of
Executive Directors, the Borrower would open and maintain two dedicated deposit accounts,
one in US Dollars and one in Guaraníes for the Borrower’s use. The Bank will disburse the
proceeds of the Loan into the foreign currency deposit account. Upon each deposit into the
foreign currency account, the Borrower would deposit an equivalent amount into the local
currency deposit account. If the proceeds of the Loan or any part thereof are used for ineligible
purposes, as defined in the Loan Agreement, the Bank will require the Borrower to either return
the amount to the deposit account for use for eligible purposes or refund the amount directly to
the Bank. The deposit account in US Dollars would be maintained in the Central Bank and its
transactions and balances fully incorporated into the Borrower’s accounting records and
financial statements, via the integrated financial management system.
120. The legal agreement will include the following clauses: (i) a clause for the provision
of a written confirmation that the amount of the loan has been credited to an account that is
available to finance budgeted expenditures, and (ii) an audit clause for the submission of an
audit report of the Deposit Account at the request of the Bank.
F. Risks and Risk Mitigation
121. There are three significant risks to the program supported by the PSDPL. These
risks are Economic and Financial Risk; Political Risk; and Institutional Capacity and Reform
Implementation Risk.
Economic and Financial Risk
122. Despite economic growth of 15 percent in 2010, Paraguay remains highly
vulnerable to regional and global economic fluctuations and to weather-related shocks. At
the same time, the country is exposed to overheating pressures including inflation pressures,
fast private sector credit growth, and a widening current account deficit. The economy is also
exposed to exchange rate risk due to the remaining high dollarization of the financial system
and a large share of foreign denominated public sector debt.
123. In terms of mitigation measures, the Government is implementing prudent fiscal
management, including efforts to increase tax revenues in the medium term and improve
expenditure execution; monetary policy is being tightened and macro-prudential measures are
being taken to contain private sector credit growth. To this end the government engages in
technical assistance with the IMF on financial regulation and supervision including in the
cooperatives sector. The external debt is low and managed prudently; flexible exchange rate
policy and a sufficient buffer of international reserves provide a cushion for shocks.
Political Risk
124. Entering into the second half of its term, the Government’s political alliance is still
fragmented and does not hold a majority of seats in Congress. There is thus a risk of
congressional bottlenecks when enacting new legal frameworks associated with the reform
program. Although selected measures for the operation do not include the adoption of any laws,
it is estimated that the political risk for this operation is high given the implications of
supported reforms in the political economy.
125. There is also a political risk associated to potential resistances to reform programs,
such as for instance in the case of SOEs. In the context of Paraguay’s current development of



                                               39
public administration and plurality of actors in the process of decision-making, the type of
proposed reforms can generate some political economy challenges during the implementation.
That was particularly the case of the SOE sector, where the actions to introduce SOE financial
transparency generated an initial resistance by the largest SOE.
126. In terms of mitigation measures, the government is enhancing communication with
regards to reform implementation. The Government is carefully planning the submission of
laws to Congress to optimize information dissemination and probability of their adoption. It
also usually works on building consensus around reform actions. The Presidency and the
Ministry of Finance are ensuring consistency and coordination with institutions by directly
implementing reform actions. Finally, gradual approaches and effective communication
strategies with stakeholders of reform processes were also undertaken by the Government.
Institutional Capacity and Reform Implementation
127. The sustainability risk for the PSDPL objectives is due to the limited capacity of
Paraguay’s public sector and its insufficient inter-institutional coordination. The prior
actions for this PSDPL require an intensive path of activities. Weak human resource capacity in
the public sector, as well as limited inter-institutional cooperation could put the success of hte
Government’s reform program at risk.
128. This risk is mitigated through a focused approach on a limited number of reform
areas, realistic targets, and mobilization of existing capacities. The program is focused on a
limited number of inter-related policy areas that are implemented by Government units with
stronger capacities, such as for instance the UMEP for the SOE component. In addition, these
areas are supported by external technical assistance: internal control reform is supported by the
USAID Umbral Program, and the SOE Oversight is supported by Bank technical assistance.

M.F. No. 2464

Mr. ROBERT ZOELLICK,
PRESIDENT, WORLD BANK
WASHINGTON D.C. 204343, USA

Re: Development Policy Letter – Public Sector Development Policy Loan

Dear Mr. Zoellick:

The Government of President Fernando Lugo, that took office on August 15, 2008, is keeping
its commitment with the priority and strategic objectives established three years ago, and
focusing on poverty reduction, economic growth, and greater transparency in public sector
management and corruption prevention.

The Government’s objectives stemmed from an in-depth diagnosis and analysis of the
country’s economic and social situation which revealed that economic growth in the last few
years was not being translated into increased welfare for broad sectors of the population.

Further to Paraguay successful recovery from 2009 crisis, supported by the Government’s
Anti-Crisis Plan approved in January 2009, there is an opportunity to focus again on medium-
term reforms, with a view to targeting key priorities for Paraguay.

State Modernization is a Government top priority to enhance public sector capacity and to
promote the economic and social development of the country. In particular, the Government
has already allocated significant resources and expressed a firm commitment to strengthen
critical areas of public sector management, such as the management of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), which represent an important proportion of public expenditure and
provide basic public services; tax administration which provides resources to support
government programs; and internal control and accountability which improves the efficacy
and integrity of financial management of the State.



                                            47
 The purpose of this Letter is to present the objectives and actions relating to the Public Sector
 Development Policy Loan (DPL) involving support to consolidate the reforms arising from
 the 2008-2013 Economic & Social Strategic Plan (presented in August 2008) and financed
 with the previous 2009-2010 Loan, as well as building on prior achievements to advance in
 new areas of public sector management.
I.         Economic & Social Strategic Plan of the Government
 The Paraguayan Government objective is to achieve more sustainable and equitable economic growth
 through four strategic goals: (i) promoting growth with a focus on employment generation and
 improved income distribution, while preserving a sound macroeconomic framework; (ii) strengthening
 Government institutions to improve policy making and deliver better public services; (iii) increasing
 the efficiency of social expenditures, focusing on extreme poverty alleviation; and (iv) fostering
 economic development with broader citizen participation.

 These objectives are supported by eight (8) strategic pillars that address the country’s economic,
 social, and institutional challenges in a comprehensive manner. These eight pillars are:
      Maintaining consistent macroeconomic policies to ensure stability and provide a
       predictable context for economic decision-making.
      Developing a sound and secure financial system providing quality services to all
       economic actors without exclusions.
      Improving SOEs through more professional, more efficient and transparent management.
      Modernizing the public administration in order to facilitate access of the entire population
       to public services.
      Introducing comprehensive land reform fostering the reactivation of family agriculture.
      Promoting infrastructure development.
      Strengthening competitiveness and improvement of the business and investment climate.
      Promoting job-generation, the fight against poverty and all forms of social exclusion.
     II.     Objectives of the Strengthening of Public Sector Management
 Within the framework of the Strategic Plan, strengthening public sector is fundamental in the
 Paraguayan context. A more professionalized transparent and sustainable public sector, able
 to provide more effective services, is indeed a prerequisite to reaching inclusive development
 in Paraguay.
 One key challenge in strengthening public sector is to increase the efficiency of resource
 management, including restructuring government institutions, strengthening internal control
 effectiveness and transparency, and gradually introducing a professional and merit-based civil
 service system.
 Another critical public sector challenge is to improve the effectiveness of the public service
 delivery by SOEs through a more effective State oversight and improvement of their business
 and financial management.
 A third fundamental challenge for public sector reform is to improve fiscal management,
 including improving tax administration, strengthening debt management, enhancing fiscal
 discipline, and managing more efficiently and transparently public expenditure.




                                                  48
III.   Public Sector Management Programs with the Public Sector Development Policy
       Loan (DPL)
Below we present the areas of implementation of the US$100 million World Bank Public
Sector Development Policy Loan (DPL). These areas relate to the above mentioned Public
Sector Management Program. In particular, the Government of Paraguay is planning to
consolidate recent advances on three major issues: SOE Oversight; Internal Financial Control
of the Central Administration; and Strengthening of Tax Administration.
       III.1 SOE Oversight
Improvement in the efficiency and transparency of SOEs and the delivery of related public
services requires an effective State oversight of the SOE portfolio. This component aims at
addressing the low access to and quality of services delivered by SOEs, and the need to
enhance their transparency and financial management.
Over the last three years, the Government has significantly advanced in establishing an
institutional framework and technical capacities for a more effective monitoring of SOEs. The
creation of the SOE Council (CEP, acronyms in Spanish), technically supported by SOE
Monitoring Unit (UMEP, acronyms in Spanish), has strengthened the Government’s decision-
making process regarding these enterprises; increased their financial transparency; and
introduced the fundamentals for a results-based management public service delivery by major
SOEs.
More recently, and related to this loan, the Government has continued improving SOE
oversight by: (i) strengthening the institutional framework; (ii) enhancing transparency in
SOE management; (iii) ensuring adequate payment of public services provided to the Central
Administration, as well as liquidation of pending payment arrears; and (iv) developing a
results-based management framework regarding SOE service delivery. The measures recently
adopted in these four areas include:
   Institutional framework regarding SOE oversight. On the one hand, there is a legal
    strengthening of the Inter-ministerial Council of SOEs and UMEP through the
    Government submission of a draft Law to Congress promoting the legal sustainability of
    these institutions. On the other hand, the CEP has approved an operational and
    organizational manual for UMEP.

   Financial transparency. Greater financial transparency is being promoted through the
    publication of SOEs audited financial statements.

   Payment of public services by Central Administration. The Government has developed a
    strategy to, on the one hand, ensure timely payment of services delivered to the
    Government by SOEs, and on the other hand, liquidate payment arrears of basic services
    provided to Central Administration entities by SOEs. Measures related to this strategy
    include: the creation of an Inter-institutional Technical Commission composed by the
    Ministry of Finance, the State General Attorney, and the SOEs; the validation of payment
    arrears between the Central Administration and the SOEs; and the establishment of
    specific mechanisms by the Government to ensure timely payment of services provided by
    SOEs to Central Administration entities.

   Development of a results-based management framework for services provided by SOEs.
    In this regard, the Government and 5 SOEs have signed their respective performance

                                             49
    management contracts, which include standardized management procedures and financial
    targets, and are monitored by UMEP. Also, UMEP has recently established a balanced
    scorecard that connects it directly to economic, financial and technical follow-up
    indicators of SOEs.

       III.2 Internal Financial Control of Central Administration
A continuous improvement in internal control and financial management effectiveness of the
Central Administration is one of the specific goals of the Government´s Public Sector
Management Program, linked to the strategic objective of ―Modernization of the State‖. Such
improvement is expected to have a significant impact on the accountability and use of public
funds.
In this regard, the Government has established the following priorities: (i) comprehensive
coverage of the integrated financial information systems for all entities, as well as full
integration with the financial management subsystems; (ii) strengthening of internal control
through greater professionalization of the internal auditing function, and establishment of a
new standardized internal control framework for the Central Administration (MECIP,
acronyms in Spanish); and (iii) progressing in the professionalization of the Central
Administration’s Financial Administration Units (UAFs).
Directly related to this loan, the Government has adopted the following measures aimed at
strengthening internal control:

   Establishment of the internal control framework (MECIP). The Government has undertake
    initiatives to adopt the MECIP for the Ministries of Agriculture, Finance, Public Works,
    Health, and Education, and to adequately staff their Internal Auditing Units.
    III.3 Tax System
Strengthening tax administration and tax collection capacity is another important area
supported by the Government Program. Measures recently adopted include:

   Strengthening auditing capacities for large taxpayers. In particular, two measures have
    contributed to this objective: (i) the modification of the legal framework (a decree issued
    by both the State Under-Secretariat for Taxation and the Superintendencia de Bancos) to
    allow financial entities to be classified as large taxpayers and, in this way, enable their
    auditing under the arrangement for large taxpayers; and (ii) the implementation of training
    for auditors at the Directorate of the State Under-Secretariat for Taxation (SET, acronyms
    in Spanish).

   Increasing the number of audits to large taxpayers. The SET has significantly increased
    the number of audited large taxpayers, among other measures aimed at increasing the
    formalization of corporate taxpayers.

   Establishment of tax compliance certificates: The SET issued 122,609 tax compliance
    certificates in 2009 and 280,105 in 2010.




                                              50
IV.    Medium-term Objectives
In the medium term, the Government has planned to keep reinforcing SOE oversight, while
making additional efforts in fiscal management. Among others, the following objectives are
particularly important:

   Working on a second phase of tax reforms. The focus will be on increasing tax efficiency
    of the Large Taxpayers’ Unit, with the possibility of introducing measures that could be
    rolled over to all taxpayers.

   Increasing public debt management efficiency.

  Consolidating good practices in SOEs financial transparency and management, supporting
   these measures with actions to improve basic service delivery, as well as to control fiscal
   risk and ensure SOEs sustainability. The Government will focus on improving the timely
   availability of financial information on state-owned enterprises and on the quality of their
   financial statements.
Beyond these improvements in public sector management, these measures will allow the
Government to consolidate its poverty reduction and infrastructure investment programs,
which are fundamental in the development of Paraguay.
The support of the World Bank will be essential to implement the abovementioned actions
and to support the ambitious strategic objectives that the Government has set for itself.


I take this opportunity to greet you with my highest consideration.

                                      Annex 4: Debt Sustainability Analysis

1.      The debt sustainability analysis is performed on the basis of two methodological
approaches. The deterministic approach presents the evolution of main determinants of
public debt over time. The stochastic approach shows how the main determinants of public
debt are affected by stochastic shocks.

2.      A favorable medium-term macroeconomic framework would help preserve a
stable path for Paraguay’s public debt in 2011-2014. The baseline for the debt
sustainability analysis is conservative. Fiscal accounts are expected to deteriorate slightly in
2011-2014 although at sustainable levels. Under these assumptions, central government gross
debt is projected to decline from 20.0 percent of GDP in 2009 to 11.5 percent of GDP in
2014. The baseline scenario is based on the assumption of an average primary surplus of 0.1
percent during 2011-2014.

3.      Fiscal prudence, economic growth and exchange rate stability are critical for
continued improvement in public debt indicators. For the baseline scenario, it was found
that during 2008 and 2010 exchange rate appreciation, fiscal adjustment (primary surplus) and
continuing healthy growth played a significant role in reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio.

4.      Following a deterministic approach to the debt sustainability analysis, it can be
found that adverse shocks could temporarily reverse the favorable debt trends observed
under the baseline scenario. Various stress tests to evaluate the behavior of the central
government debt ratio under different scenarios have been considered. For example, a one-
time 30 percent exchange rate depreciation in 2011. This shock would cause the debt-to-GDP
ratio to deteriorate rapidly to 18.4 in 2011, going back to 17.1 in 2012 and remaining volatile
thereafter.

   1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
   2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator;
   g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
   denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
   3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
   4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
   5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous
   period.
   6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

     7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
     8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
     9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic
     inflation (based on GDP deflator).
     10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last
     projection year.
