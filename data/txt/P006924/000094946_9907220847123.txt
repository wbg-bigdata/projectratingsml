IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
COSTA RICA
Atlantico Agricultural Development Project (Loan 2764-CR)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Atlantico Agricultural
Development Project in Costa Rica, for which Loan 2764-CR, originally in the amount of
US$26.0 million equivalent, was approved on October 21, 1986 and made effective on
October 4, 1988. In 1995, on the Borrower's request, the Loan amount was reduced to
US$22.85 million.
The Loan was closed on June 30, 1997, three years after the original Closing Date
of June 30, 1994. The final disbursement was made on October 3, 1997, at which time a
balance of US$2.2 million was cancelled.
The ICR was prepared by Ms. Silvia Castro of the Latin America and the
Caribbean Region with the assistance of Messrs. Claudio Gregorio and Jose M. Caballero
of the Food and Agriculture Organization Cooperative Program, and Mauricio Chaves,
consultant. The ICR is based on a final supervision/completion mission in June 1997,
material in the project file, discussions with officials of the executing agencies, field visits
and interviews with project beneficiaries. The completion mission's Aide-Memoire is
included as Appendix B. The Borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by: (i)
discussing major points included in the report; (ii) providing information and collecting
data; and (iii) providing its own Implementation Completion Report, which is included as
Appendix C.

COSTA RICA
ATLANTICO AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 2764-CR)
Evaluation Summary
INTRODUCnON
1.    The loan for the Atlantico Agricultural Development Project, originally for US$26
million, was approved by the Board on October 21, 1986, and became effective on October 4,
1988. In 1995, the Borrower requested a cancellation of US$3.15 million. On October 6, 1995,
the Bank's Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Loan Agreement to use loan
savings to finance the expansion of successful components of the project. The project objective
remained unchanged. The loan closed on June 30, 1997. Following the last disbursement, which
took place on October 3, 1997, undisbursed funds of about US$2.2 million were cancelled.
PRojEcr OBJECrIVE AND COMPONENTS
2.    The development objective of the Atlantico Agricultural Development Project was to
expand production of agricultural export commodities from the project area. To achieve this
objective, the project included three components: (a) a credit line, which was the central core of
the project, to finance the development of cocoa and coconut plantations; (b) a land titling
program to give farmers security of tenure and facilitated access to the credit component; and (c)
a rural roads program intended to address the inadequacy of the road network in the project area.
The loan also financed sector studies and support for the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU)
(paras. 1 and 2 of the main text).
IPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
3.    Achievement of Project Objective. The project development objective was largely
achieved, although with considerable delays. Although it cannot be attributed solely to the
project, the production of traditional export crops in the project area more than doubled, and that
of nontraditional export crops tripled during the project period. The land titling program has
been a determining factor for the creation of producer organizations and for gaining access to
sources of credit. The rural roads program has helped improve access to input and product
distribution centers, thus increasing product quality, and lowering production costs (paras. 7-10).
4.    The land titling and rural roads components have also had an important social impact.
The land titling program has enabled farmers to obtain financing for low-income housing, while
the rural roads component has provided permanent access to basic social, educational and health
services and in several cases to electrification. However, the contribution of the credit line to
poverty alleviation was limited as subloans to small producers accounted for only a small share
of the total value of the subloans financed (paras. 18-19).
5.    The project contributed to the development of the private sector by financing on-farm
investments by private farmers, financing the land titling and rural roads components which
induced additional private investments, and transferring to private user associations



ii
responsibility for planning and execution of the rehabilitation and maintenance of rural roads in
the project area (para. 21).
6.    Major Factors Affecting the Project. One exogenous factor affecting the project was that
the international market price of cocoa and coconut oil dropped significantly (51 and 47 percent
respectively) by the time the credit component effectively started in 1990, making investments in
these crops unprofitable. Hence, the Bank agreed to the Government's request to shift the credit
line to finance nontraditional export crops, which proved to be a successful modification of
project design. Another exogenous factor were three natural disasters (Hurricane Joan in 1988,
an earthquake in 1991, and severe flooding in 1994.) Responding to the Borrower's request, the
Bank agreed to reduce the amount of the credit component by more than half, and to use these
saving to finance the Borrower's emergency reconstruction efforts (para. 22).
7.   In addition, some factors under government control also affected the project. First,
extremely lengthy legislative procedures, common in Costa Rica, resulted in a two-year delay in
loan effectiveness. Second, inefficient procurement and contracting procedures of the Borrower
caused considerable delays in the contracting of works and services and the procurement of
goods. Third, weaknesses in the Ministry of Public Works (MOPT) caused delays in road
design, preparation of bidding documents and execution of works, as well as repeated cases of
improper use of equipment purchased with loan funds (eventually corrected). Finally,
insufficient budgetary resources and low expenditure ceilings became a constant problem,
especially during the last three years of project implementation (paras. 23-26).
8.    Bank andBorrower Performance. Bank performance at preparation/appraisal is rated
deficient because of weaknesses in project design and because the Bank did not involve the
Banco Nacional de Costa Rica (BNCR) sufficiently in the preparation process, despite BNCR' s
responsibility for executing the credit component, which was originally the largest and most
important component of the project. Bank performance during implementation is rated
marginally satisfactory. In particular, during early supervision, Bank staff should have paid
more attention to the low share of small farmers benefiting from the project, and an inadequate
provision of technical assistance to farmers to prepare subproject proposals and carry them out
(paras. 38-32).
9.    The performance of the Borrower is rated deficient mainly because of chronic problems
adversely affecting the overall portfolio in Costa Rica, such as the slow legislative process that
delayed project effectiveness for two years and cumbersome procurement and administrative
procedures that caused extensive delays in project implementation. In addition, the low budget
and expenditure ceilings given to executing agencies adversely affected the timely
implementation of project activities.
10.   At the same time, however, the performance of most of the executing agencies, as
opposed to "the Borrower", was satisfactory. The BNCR financed sound investments and
disbursed at a satisfactory pace. The Instituto de Desarrollo Agrario (IDA) had an excellent
performance in the land titling component, vastly surpassing the original project targets. The
Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) showed a strong commitment to the project despite the
difficulties encountered throughout project implementation. While MOPT experienced a number
of problems in implementing the roads component, the management of rural roads maintenance
by local community groups was remarkably successful (paras. 32-3 7).



iii
11.   Assessment of Outcome. The project's overall outcome is rated marginally unsatisfactory.
On the positive side, the development objective of increasing export crops in the Atlantic Region
was achieved, and the land titling and the rural roads programs provided considerable benefits to
the farmers and others in the project area. However, the excessive delays in project
implementation make it difficult to justify an overall rating of satisfactory, although the
Borrower rates the project outcome as "very satisfactory" (para. 38).
PROJECr SUSTAINABILrrY AND FuTURE OPERATION
12.   Project sustainability is likely. The agricultural investments financed under the credit
component are generally sound, the benefits to those receiving clear land title will be long
lasting, and community organizations continue to successfully manage rural road maintenance.
At the same time, there remains uncertainty about the Borrower's future capacity to provide
budgetary support to build upon the successes of the project. For example, the Borrower needs
to provide adequate budgetary support to IDA's future land titling program to complete titling of
about 4,000 farms in the project area that were not financed by this project (para. 27).
13.   Future Operation. No follow up project is being considered (para. 39).
KEY LESSONS LEARNED
14.   The following lessons can be drawn from this project (para 40):
(a)   The design of agricultural development projects to support significant technology
change must include clear methodological indicators and a work program for
technology extension, together with the budgeting of the resources required. The
design should also include a clear identification and an analysis of the target
group (or groups) of the agricultural program, a justification for their selection,
and a description of the.targeting instruments.
(b)   In projects where credit is a fundamental development instrument, it is important
to fully involve the participating bank-not only the head office but also local
branches-in the process of project preparation, in order to develop ownership
and discover and address possible implementation problems.
(c)   The institutional implementation capacity of all involved entities should be
carefully evaluated. This is especially important for rural roads components
because state agencies that exercise jurisdiction over the entire road sector are
often unable or unwilling to allocate adequate human resources and equipment to
rural programs-higher priority often is given to the more visible task of national
highway construction.
(d)   An unusually positive lesson of the project is that execution of activities with
active community participation - as in the rural roads maintenance program of
this project- can result in considerable efficiencies and cost savings.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
COSTA RICA
ATLANTICO AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 2764-CR)
PART I: PROJECT IPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.   PROJECT OBJECT WE
I1.    The development objective of the Atlantico Agricultural Development Project was to
expand production of agricultural export commodities from the project area. To achieve this
objective, the project included three components:
(a)   Credit Line (US$8.9 million of the loan amount, as amended). The original
objective of the credit component was to provide agricultural credit to finance
the development of 7,000 ha of cocoa and coconut plantations, including
rehabilitating about 3,000 ha of existing cocoa trees, replanting about 1,500 ha
of old cocoa fields, and new planting of about 2,500 ha. This was to take place
in a specified area of the Atlantic Coast Region recommended for cocoa and
coconut. As a result of several amendments to the Loan and Project
Agreements, the eligible crops and areas were modified and the allocation of the
loan amount was progressively reduced from the original US$22.5 million to
US$8.9 million. The executing agency was the Banco Nacional de Costa Rica
(BNCR).
(b)   Land Titling (US$0.7 million of the loan amount, as amended). The land titling
program had two objectives. The first one was to issue about 1,500 land titles
in the project area, where nearly 20% of the farmers were lacking clear title,
affecting their access to institutional credit. The second objective was to give
farmers-once they had a title-access to the agricultural lending program of
the project. As a result of amendments to the Loan Agreement, the physical
target was increased to issuing 4,600 titles and the allocation of the loan
amount was increased from US$0.3 million to US$0.7 million. The executing
agency was the Instituto de Desarrollo Agrario (IDA).
(c)   Rural Roads (US$12.1 million of the loan amount, as amended). The rural
roads component intended to address, at least partially, the issue of the
inadequacy of the road network in the project area which was considered
precarious in qualitative and quantitative terms. The Bank loan originally
included the construction or rehabilitation of about 105 km of priority feeder
roads and the procurement of machinery and workshop equipment required for
carrying out a Rural Roads Maintenance Program (RRMP) based on sustained
community participation. As a result of several amendments to the Loan
Agreement, this component was expanded to include construction,



2
rehabilitation or upgrading of about 780 km of road infrastructure and
maintenance of 1,640 km of existing roads. The allocation of the loan amount
was progressively increased from less US$2.2 million to US$12.1 million (i.e.,
from less than 9% at project start to about 53% by project completion). The
Ministry of Public Works (MOPT) was the implementing agency.
2.    In addition to the above components, US$0.3 million of the loan amount were
allocated to sector studies, US$0.2 mnillion to strengthening of the Project Coordinating Unit
(PCU), and US$0.6 million was unallocated.'
B.    EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
3.    The project's development objective was clear and consistent with both Government
policy and the Bank's assistance strategy for Costa Rica. However, in hindsight, several flaws
are evident in project design. The credit component was directed to two crops only, coconuts
and cocoa, which faced uncertain intemational price prospects. In the case of cocoa, the trend
was already declining. The risk section of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) explains that the
reason for focusing on these two crops was that the "financial and economic rate of return on
investments in these crops would remain attractive even with possible decline in their prices".
As it turned out, this was not the case. Although the economic analysis section of the SAR
analyzed the potential impact of price declines of up to 20%, the actual declines were closer to
50%. Consequently, BNCR made virtually no lending for these two crops and, at the
Borrower's request, the Bank agreed to expand the list of eligible crops to include non-
traditional as well as other traditional crops such as oranges and bananas.
4.    During project design, insufficient attention was given to the technical problems
associated with coconuts and cocoa and to the risk that these problems might slow down or
limit adoption. The project design suffered from "adoption optimism" in this respect. Thus,
the project assumed the rapid acceptance of considerable technical changes requiring major
alterations and intensification of farming practices. Coconut had not been grown previously as
a commercial crop in the project area and was affected by several diseases. Cocoa was a well-
known commercial crop, but very little crop husbandry was applied by cocoa farmers, most of
whom were traditionally just harvesters. Furthermnore, the mixed cocoa-coconut plantation,
whatever the technical merits, was a new concept in Costa Rica. A possible slower adoption
rate was raised in the risk section of the SAR, but it was considered mitigated because "the
project provides for an intensive technical assistance program to be carried out by BNCR".
This expectation was unrealistic. BNCR, which as a banking institution was not well placed to
operate an extension service, was thus made responsible for providing extension to farmers to
be financed from its own funds, without a prior design of the work program, extension
methodology and resources required. As a result, the BNCR technical assistance program
never materialized.
Costs savings were realized and reallocated through a restructuring of the project to expand the rural
roads and land titling programs (for more details on the project restructuring, see Memorandum of the
President, R95-179, September 26, 1995). In addition, US$3.15 million of the original loan amount
(US$26 million) was canceled in accordance with the Borrower's request in 1995. An additional amount
of about US$2.2 million was canceled after the last disbursement was made on October 3, 1997.



3
5.    The SAR expected 30% of the beneficiaries to be small farmers (annual incomes below
C1 50,000 at 1985 prices) and the remaining 70% to come from the lower echelons of medium
farmers (annual incomes of C160,000-170,000). But there was little in the design of the
project to justify that expectation, and, in fact, larger farmers and farming companies were the
"natural" beneficiaries of the project. For example, the Project Agreement "limited" the
amount to be lent to a single beneficiary to US$500,000, and "limited" subloans above
US$300,000 to ten subprojects or 15% of the credit line. These lirnits were too high to serve
as effective targeting mechanisms capable of giving a small-farmer orientation to the project.
6.    Regarding the rural roads component, its objectives were clear in principle and
consistent with the project's strategy. However, the road works actually required in the
project area were substantially underestimated. The component also suffered from: (a) lack of
more accurate engineering design standards and construction criteria specifically suited to the
prevailing conditions in the project area (i.e., year-round high rainfall, nature of soils, quality
of and access to quarries); (b) insufficient attention to the implications of designating MOPT as
the implementing agency of a small rural roads program; and (c) lack of a detailed
implementation timetable and clear operational rules for the RRMP to provide adequate
benchmarks for close monitoring of its progress. Important changes were made to the project
during implementation to address these issues.
C.    ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Development of Erport Crops
7.    Despite the original design flaws mentioned earlier, the project development objective
was largely achieved. Although it cannot be attributed solely to the project, the volume of
production of traditional export crops in the project area more than doubled and that of
nontraditional export crops tripled during the project period.2 The credit component helped
finance 12% of the growth of the area planted with export crops and 19% of non-traditional
export crops during 1989-1992. (Part II, Table 5.B.6)
8.    A positive feature of the credit component is the general soundness of the investments
made with project subloans. Appendix A analyzes representative farm models in the project
area, with financial rates of return ranging from 27% to over 50%. Another, indirect indication
of the rate of success, is subloan repayment. Of the 168 subloans financed by the project, only
five subloans (accounting for 5.5% of the total amount lent under the project's own credit line)
had to be submitted for formal collection procedures, and another five (9% of the amount lent)
were classified as being of "uncertain collection" by BNCR. The remaining 158 subloans have
already been repaid or are being paid on time.3
2   Over 45% of Costa Rica's agricultural exports are produced in the Atlantico Region. During 1989-92,
when the credit line was disbursing, non-traditional exports grew 22% annually in the project area,
compared to only 11% for Costa Rica as a whole.
3   This ratio compares well with an overall delinquency ratio of 25.6% and a delinquent portfolio over 60
days of 13% in 1996 for loans that BNCR funded with its own resources in the project area. At the time
of appraisal (1984), BNCR's delinquent portfolio represented 19.7% of the total outstanding portfolio
(SARW p. 40).



4
9.    The land titling program was very successful. Land ownership provided by the project
has been a major factor in the creation of producer organizations and in increasing general
access to credit, especially from non-bank sources. In addition, although not an explicit
project objective, the land titling component has had an important impact in the social
development of the project area. For example, in the last few years, two NGOs have been
implementing low-income housing programs in the region that have directly benefited project
land title beneficiaries, which would not have been possible without the project, since farmers
without titles have had no access to this type of financing.
10.   The rural roads program also had several positive results. Ample anecdotal evidence
shows that the main economic benefit was a dramatically improved access to input and product
distribution centers resulting in reduced farming costs and improved quality of produce sold, as
well as in opening new possibilities for higher value crops (such as beans, starch plants, palm
kernel, peppers, fruits) in areas formerly uncultivated or used for grazing or subsistence crops.
Roads and bridges have allowed agricultural producers to bring their crops to market, and have
contributed to restoring communications and providing access to basic services to rural
communities after natural disasters struck. Moreover, all this was achieved with substantial
community involvement, thanks to a campaign launched by the PCU which intended to change
the prevailing attitude of expecting the state to provide all the resources.
Physical Targets
11.   The achievement of physical targets of the credit component was partial. As noted
above, the overall project objective of expanding agricultural exports was achieved. However,
whereas the original targets of the credit component were to finance 1,040 farms and a total of
7,000 ha, the final results were only 168 farms and a total of 4,484 ha. To some extent, this
was due to reducing the original credit component from US$22.5 million to US$8.9 million,
but the larger impact was caused by actual individual loan sizes being about three times higher
than originally estimated.
12.   The land titling program's original goal of issuing 1,500 titles envisaged in the SAR
was achieved and surpassed with remarkable success. By June 30, 1993, when the funds
originally allocated to the component (US$0.3 million) were exhausted, IDA had surpassed the
SAR target, having issued 2,331 titles. A new goal of issuing a total of 4,620 titles was
established in October 1995 at the time of project restructuring, which was also surpassed in
early 1996. By June 1997, IDA had actually issued 6,120 titles.4
13.   The achievement of physical targets of the rural roads component was partial, but
satisfactory. Although the original road targets were actually exceeded, even more could have
been done had there not been delays due to several factors, such as unusually adverse weather
conditions, delays in agreeing with the Bank on the scope of environmental impact assessment
studies, and procedural conflicts between the Comptroller and the National Emergency
Commission. These delays were the main reason that US$2.2 million was cancelled when the
loan was eventually closed.
4  At the conclusion of the project, there remain 4,000 farms that still lack land surveying in the project area
which were not included in the project.



5
14.   The overall achievement of the RRMP is rated satisfactory, especially in consideration
of the success attained in attracting community participation in planning and execution of rural
roads routine and extraordinarily good maintenance - including provision of direct
community labor and financial resources up to 35% of the brigades' operating costs.
Economic and Sectoral Objectives
15.   The project's contribution to the overall sectoral objective of export crop development
was relatively small but significant, and could have been even bigger if the credit line had not
been discontinued when the project was restructured to greatly expand the rural roads
component. The project years were ones of swift development of a diversified agricultural
export economy in the Atlantic Region of Costa Rica. The planted surface of the principal
export crops in the project area expanded by some 35,581 ha (from 43,900 ha in 1989 to
79,478 ha in 1992) during the period that the credit line was disbursing. Of the newly planted
area, 12% of export crops and 19% of nontraditional crops were financed by the project.
While in terms of overall area the project's contribution may appear modest, it was especially
important for some crops such as oranges (37%).
16.   The project's economic rate of return (ERR), estimated at about 18% in the SAR, was
not recalculated. This ERR had been originally calculated on the expected cash flows of cocoa
and coconut plantations only, and excluded the titling and roads component. Therefore, the
abandonment of the cocoa-coconut program in favor of other export crops, as well as the
restructured road component, would have deprived a recalculation of its comparative meaning.
17.   Nevertheless, Appendix A presents an economic assessment of all three investment
components: credit, land titling and rural roads. Regarding the credit component, Appendix A
analyzes the financial rates of return for indicative farm models for cropping patterns actually
supported by the project, with positive results ranging from 27% to over 50%. These, along
with the low rate of loan default, and the non-project expansion of production of exports crops
in the project area, suggest that it is likely that the investments financed by the credit
component were sound and profitable. The Appendix concludes that it is reasonable to
attribute, at least partially, the economic advancement of the Atlantic Region to the project-
financed investments. Appendix A also concludes that there were positive economic results for
the land titling component, based on data collected through case studies of farmers in the
project area, and for the rural roads component, based on data on the costs and benefits of
rural roads rehabilitation and maintenance.



6
Social Objectives
18.   Social objectives were explicitly stated in the original project documents. Moreover,
the project's "targeting mechanisms" for the credit line (such as a maximum loan size of
US$500,000) were not effective to ensure that the credit line was limited to the needs of the
small farming community. Hence, the contribution of the credit line to social issues was
limited. Overall, the effect of the lack of a self-selection mechanism in the project design was
that only 17 small farmers were able to obtain subloans from the project, jointly accounting for
less than 1% of the total value of the subloans financed. This caused a missed opportunity of
helping small farmers to get more involved in the rapidly growing industry of nontraditional
export crops and share in its benefits.
19.   Albeit unplanned, the land titling and rural road components had an important impact
on the social development of the project area by contributing to the betterment of the general
living conditions of the people. The titling program enabled farmers to access financing from
NGOs which have developed a low-income housing program in the region during the past few
years. The rural roads component provided permanent access to basic social, educational and
health services and, in several cases, to electrification-the existence of an all-weather road
access to any rural settlement being a conditio sine qua non to apply for a connection to the
power supply network.
Other Objectives
20.   Although the SAR expected the project to have a benign environmental impact, an
environmental concern did arise late in project implementation, namely for all the road
construction projects included in the October 1995 amendment to the Loan Agreement to be
subject to new environmental assessment requirements. As'a consequence, albeit after some
delays, the PCU took appropriate measures to minimize the environmental risks of the new
road construction works, including the risk that improved access may encourage human
activities in these areas and therefore result in habitat conversion or degradation.
Environmental assessment studies based on terms of reference approved by the Bank were
carried out in respect to all new road construction projects, and mitigation measures
recommended. Environmental good practice rules for the road contractors were included in
bidding documents.
21.   The project contributed to the development of the private sector to the extent that
subloans went to private farmers or farm companies to invest on-farm, and that it succeeded in
transferring to private user associations increased responsibility for rural road maintenance
planning and execution. It is, however, an open question whether the type of medium and
large farmers and farming companies financed by the project required a Bank loan to the
Borrower, or if in the absence of the credit component, those farmers would have still found
the financial resources required to invested in their farmns.

D.   MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Factors Not Subject to Government Control
22.   Two factors of this nature significantly affected project implementation. The first was a
significant fall in the international market price of cocoa and coconut oil between the time the
project was being prepared/appraised (1984-85) and the implementation of the credit line
(1989-90)5. As a consequence, Government and the Bank agreed to shift the credit
component to finance other nontraditional export crops, with success. The second factor was
three natural disasters: Hurricane Joan in November 1988, an earthquake in April 1991, and
extensive flooding in November 1994, all of which required significant resources to finance
reconstruction efforts. Responding to the Borrower's request, the Bank agreed to reduce the
scope of the credit component, and transfer more than half of the original loan allocation of the
credit line to finance the Borrower's emergency reconstruction efforts.
Factors Subject to Government Control
23.   Several factors affected project implementation resulting in a long increase in project
duration - completion of project activities eventually took 3 years longer than originally
planned. First, extremely lengthy legislative procedures, common in Costa Rica, resulted in
loan effectiveness incurring a two-year delay.
24.   Second, insufficient budgetary resources and low expenditure ceilings became a
constant problem, especially during the last three years of implementation. For example, the
delay by the Ministry of Finance in reimbursing BNCR for the funds it used from its own
resources to prefinance the project's lending program led to BNCR's decision not to accept
any subloan applications for project financing after October 1992. The Bank tried on several
occasions to address this issue by requesting the Borrower to ensure the availability of funds
for project completion but, despite the positive response of the Borrower, this problem
continued affecting and delaying implementation progress, until the credit component itself was
termiinated.
25.   Third, the inefficient procurement and contracting procedures caused considerable
delays in the contracting of works and services and notably in the purchasing of machinery and
equipment, thus delaying completion of the rural roads component.
26.   Lastly, MOPT's inability to perform effectively as the component's executing agency
and to achieve acceptable coordination with the PCU caused delays and mishandling in road
design, preparation of bidding documents and execution of works, as well as repeated cases of
improper use of equipment purchased with loan funds (eventually corrected) which resulted in
undue interference with the RRMP operations.
The average world market price of cocoa dropped from US$/ton 232 to 126, and that of coconut oil from
USc/kg 872 to 427, from 1985 to 1990, respectively.

E. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
27.   Project sustainability is likely. The agricultural investments financed under the credit
component are generally sound, the benefits to those receiving clear land title will be long
lasting, and community organizations continue to successfully manage rural road maintenance.
At the same time, there remains uncertainty about the Borrower's future capacity to provide
budgetary support to build upon the successes of the project. In particular, the Borrower
needs to provide adequate budgetary support to IDA's future land titling program to complete
titling of about 4,000 farms in the project area that were not financed by this project
F.    WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE
28.   World Bank performance during preparation and appraisal is rated deficient. First,
during project preparation the Bank did not involve BNCR sufficiently, despite BNCR having
to execute the largest and, at the time, most important component of the project. Project
preparation remained mostly the responsibility of IDA, and BNCR never quite developed true
project ownership, particularly at the local level.
29.   In addition, some comments are warranted regarding preparation and appraisal of the
rural roads component. Despite the fact that preparation documents and even the SAR
repeatedly state that the road network in the entire project area was inadequate, the project
included only eleven road sections for the construction/rehabilitation program, totaling 104.4
km. The open question remains to what extent the implementation ofjust eleven road
subprojects could have contributed to the achievement of the project's development objectives.
30.   Bank performance during implementation is rated marginally satisfactory. On the one
hand, the Bank quickly responded to the many unforeseen changes in circumstances
experienced during the unusually long project lifetime, corrected on the way some of the
design flaws, and showed flexibility in respect to the Borrower's needs, as demonstrated by the
Bank's agreement to nine amendments of the Loan and/or Project Agreements and to five
extensions of the loan Closing Date. Through these revisions, export crops other than cocoa
and coconut were financed, and the project area was expanded to cover zones with good
potential for some of the new crops. The Bank was also quick to respond to natural disasters
which struck the project area, reallocating funds to emergency reconstruction needs. This was
much appreciated by the Borrower and local populations.
31.   This flexible response to new circumstances and design shortcomings was largely due
to effective supervision missions, which detected the problems and reacted to them.
Notwithstanding the changes in task managers (there were five task managers from 1987 to
1997), the quantity of supervision was adequate, with 25 supervision missions between May
1987 and June 1997. Missions paid attention to the timely detection of problems arising as a
consequence of design and planning flaws as well as of inadequate management. Most of the
shortcomings of project design were effectively addressed. Supervision missions also provided
substantial input for the major refocusing of the project that led to the October 1995
amendment.
32.   Despite the above, early supervision should have paid more attention to the social
impact of the project. The large size of the subloans and the fact that very few of them were



9
reaching small farmers did not appear to be a major concern. Also, the Bank did not take a
firm stance on the lack of provision of technical assistance to farmers to prepare subproject
proposals and carry them out, in spite of the discussion of this issue during some early
supervision visits.
G.   BORROWER PERFORMANCE
33.   On the whole, the performance of the Borrower is rated deficient, although this masks
a generally successful performance by the implementing agencies, especially the PCU, BNCR
and IDA. This discrepancy in the overall rating of the Borrower as opposed to that of the
PCU and executing agencies is due to several reasons. First, Costa Rica's slow legislative
process delayed project effectiveness for two years (Part II, Table 3.) Second, it took
Government over one year to reach internal agreement as to the scope of the restructured
project. Third, Government's cumbersome procurement and administrative procedures, which
are far beyond the responsibility of the PCU or the executing agencies, caused extensive delays
in project implementation. Lastly, the low budget and expenditure ceilings given to executing
agencies adversely affected the timely implementation of project activities.
34.   The performance of the executing agencies, however, was generally satisfactory.
BNCR disbursed at a satisfactory pace, after some delay in preparing and submitting to the
Bank the operational manual for the credit line and a slow lending start. From its own banking
perspective, orienting the lending program to relatively large subloans for comparatively well-
off farmers was the right commercial strategy. Where BNCR failed was in the delivery of
technical assistance services. As indicated before, it is clear that BNCR had difficulties in
organizing the type of extension program required and had no incentive to finance it with its
own funds.
35.  IDA had a very high degree of commitment during the implementation of the project
and performed beyond expectations. Its excellent performance was reflected on the
achievement and surpassing of the goals set, largely due to the diligence of the Director of the
project-sponsored land titling program of IDA.
36.   MOPT was the only agency that had a poor performance record, which resulted in
considerable delays in contracting and procurement procedures to carry out the roads
component. However, this was partially mitigated after the October 1995 amendment, which
gave the PCU full responsibility for the RRMP activities, which were carried out with
remarkable success.
37.  Finally, the PCU should be commended for its strong commitment to the project.
Despite the many difficulties encountered throughout project implementation, the drive to
bring the project to a successful ending contributed to bringing together the communities in the
project area as well as helping them work together in their search for prosperity.
H.   ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
38.   The project's overall outcome is rated marginally unsatisfactory. On the positive side,
the development objective of increasing export crops in the Atlantic Region was largely
achieved. In addition, the land titling and the rural roads programs provided considerable



10
benefits to the farmers and others in the project area. However, the excessive delays in project
implementation make it difficult to justify an overall rating of satisfactory, although the
Borrower rates the project outcome as "very satisfactory".
I.    FUTURE OPERATION
39.   No follow up project is being considered. However, there seems to be good scope for
further export crop development in the project area, and considerable opportunities also exist
for consolidating and expanding the achievements of the RRMP. If such a project were to be
pursued, it is recommended that it be clearly targeted to small farmers, and that it give proper
attention to the extension, farmer organization, managerial training and marketing support
required.
J.    KEY LESSONS LEARNED
40.   The following lessons can be drawn from this project:
(a)   The design of agricultural development projects to support significant
technology change must include clear methodological indicators and a work
program for technology extension, together with the budgeting of the resources
required. The design should also include a clear identification and an analysis of
the target group (or groups) of the agricultural program, a justification for their
selection, and a description of the targeting instruments.
(b)   In projects where credit is a fundamental development instrument, it is
important to fully involve the participating bank-not only the head office but
also local branches-in the process of project preparation, in order to develop
ownership and discover and address possible implementation problems.
(c)   The institutional implementation capacity of all involved entities should be
carefully evaluated. This is especially important for rural roads components
because state agencies that exercise jurisdiction over the entire road sector are
often unable or unwilling to allocate adequate human resources and equipment
to rural programs-higher priority often is given to the more visible task of
national highway construction.
(d)   An unusually positive lesson of the project is that execution of activities with
active community participation - as in the rural roads maintenance program of
this project- can result in considerable efficiencies and cost savings.

Note: BNCR provided the breakdown by class of producers shown in this table. This classification differs from
that provided in Annex 3 of the SAR which is based on annual levels of income. Instead, BNCR defined small
producers as those cultivating small crops in areas between 0.5 and 12 ha; a medium-size producer as a producer
living mostly on agricultural income but also engaged in a trade or professional activity; and a large producer as
one who has the technical and financial capacity to invest in technological innovations.

Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits
1.    The ERR was estimated at appraisal at about 18 percent, based only on the coconut/cacao
credit component that was not carried out. At the project's completion indicative farm models for
cropping patterns actually supported by the project were analyzed with positive results ranging
from 27% to over 50% (Appendix A, Annex 2). Moreover, the relatively low rate of default (5
percent under formal collection and 9 percent classified as of uncertain collection) may also be a
good indication of the soundness of the investments financed (Statistical Annex, Table 5, B.2). In
addition, the production of nontraditional exports crops almost doubled between 1989-1992
(when the credit line was disbursing), and the Bank loan financed 19 percent of this expansion
(Statistical Annex, Table 5, B.4). Therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude that the Bank-
financed investments have been economically positive and have contributed to the economic
advancement of the Atlantic Region.
2.    Regarding land titling and rural roads rehabilitation and maintenance, Appendix A to the
Statistical Tables presents an economic analysis of the land titling component based on data
collected through a survey of farmers in the project area, and general data on the costs and
benefits of rural roads rehabilitation and maintenance in other Latin American countries, as well as
statistical data on the component of this project.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT

Atlantico Agricultural Development Project (Loan 2764-CR)
ECONOMIC EVALUATION
1.    The economic rate of return (ERR) of project investments (mainly cocoa and coconut) was
estimated at appraisal at about 18 percent. Although the coconut/cocoa component was not
implemented, a calculation of the financial rate of return (FRR) of representative investments actually
financed was carried out. The FRR of the indicative farm models suggest that the investments
financed were profitable (yucca, 55 percent; hearts of palm, 29 percent; bananas, 27 percent;
pineapple, more than 50 percent). (See Appendix 1, Annex 2.)
2.    In addition, the relatively low rate of default (5 percent under formal legal procedures and 9
percent classified as of uncertain collection) may be used as an indication of the soundness of the
investments financed with the project's credit line (Part II, Table 5.B.2). Another indication is the
expansion of production of nontraditional exports crops, which almost doubled during 1989-1992
(when the credit line was disbursing), and the Bank loan financed 19 percent of this expansion (Part
II, Table 5,B.4).1 Therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude that the Bank-financed investments
have been economically positive and have contributed to the economic advancement of the Atlantic
Region.
3.    The components for land titling and rural roads rehabilitation and maintenance were not part
of the original economic analysis in the SAR. However, the following sections present an economic
assessment of the land titling component based on data collected through case studies of farmers in
the project area, and general data of the costs and benefits of rural roads rehabilitation and
maintenance in other World Bank projects, as well as statistical data available for this project.
Land Titling
4.    "Land titling can generate many benefits, including improved efficiency of land markets,
reduction in conflict over land, enhanced access to credit, and improved incentives to invest in
agricultural production."2 Empirical evidence from Asia and Latin America (studies conducted for
example in Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Paraguay, and Honduras during the 1980s and 1990s)
indicates that, given certain conditions, the economic benefits of land registration are "improved
access to institutional credit, more investment (particularly land-attached investment), more variable
input use, higher yields and higher farm income."3 A 1970 study of the economic implications of
I  It should be noted that the Bank financed this expansion with less than half ($8.9 million) the funds originally
allocated to the credit line ($22.5 million).

land titling in Costa Rica revealed positive correlations between the degree of ownership security and
farm investment per unit of land.4
5.    Case studies conducted in early 1997 as part of the implementation completion rnission of the
land titling component confirm that the component facilitated farmers' access to agricultural lending,
especially from producer associations. This was evident when the situation of the titled farmers was
compared to that of farmers who still lack title in areas like Paraiso and Vega-las Palmas who
complained of the total lack of access to institutional credit.
6.    In recent years, producer associations have spread substantially in the Atlantic Region of
Costa Rica. Farmers acknowledge their need to organize to obtain greater benefits from their crops,
eliminate intermediaries, and access credit. Because formal credit is limited, producer associations
have developed their own credit schemes, ranging from a credit fund created with member
contributions to be used for emergency situations, to credit lines for production investment funded
with resources obtained from banks or NGOs.
7.    The most important association is the Asociaci6n de Pequenos Productores de Talamanca
(APPTA), which was founded in 1987 to promote organic agriculture. APPTA benefits more than
1,500 farmers, 20 percent of them from the project area. In 1993, APPTA gave credit to more than
60 farmers in the project area, to finance squash, yucca and plantain. More importantly, APPTA
itself is a beneficiary of the land titling program; and the title recently allowed it to access a 22
million ($95,000) mortgage loan to build the fruit processing plant which will allow APPTA to
export ten different varieties of fruits.
8.    The second most important association is the Asociacion de Pequenos Productores de
Margarita en Talamanca (APPMT), and was founded seven years ago. The APPMT has 68
members, all of whom received titles under the project. Although some of APPMT's members have
accessed other sources of informal credit, the association has created a $20,000 credit fund for
emergencies. Loans range from $500 to $2,000, are approved immediately, carry no interest, and
require no guarantee, and are repaid in kind (crops) at the end of six months. The fund is capitalized
with a percentage of the price of every box of plantain exported.
9.    Another association is the Asociaci6n de Productores de Banano y Cacao Orgainico
(ABACO). It groups 148 producers of organic banana who also received titles under the project.
With the title, the producers were able to obtain a mortgage loan from the Fondo de Microproyectos
Costarricense (FOMIC) and another from Asociaci6n ANAI, which allowed them to create a fund
for small loans to improve banana production.
10.   In contrast to the above examples, there are other producer associations located in the
project area which were not covered by the project, and group producers of plantain and hearts of
palm for export (such as the Asociaci6n de Productores de Paraiso with 60 members; Asociaci6n
Vega-Las Palmas with 12 members; and the Asociaci6n Conservacionista de Sixaolo with 40
members). These farmers still lack titling due to legal disputes affecting their lands. These

associations created small credit funds for their members, but their representatives reported to Bank
staff that the lack of title does not allow them to access any other source of credit.
11.   Although it is not directly related to the objectives of the program, the land titling component
has had an important impact in the social development of the project area. In the last few years, two
NGOs (the Fundaci6n de Desarrollo del Colorado (FUNDECOL) and the Fundaci6n Pro-JVivienda
(FUPROVI)) have been developing a low-income housing program in the region. In the settlements
of the Instituto de Desarollo Agrario (IDA) alone, FUNDECOL has financed 106 houses while
FUPROVI has financed 44. Several houses have been also financed outside of IDA settlements. This
would not have been possible without the titles given by the program, since farmers without titles
have had no access to this type of financing.
12.   The above results from the case studies are comparable to the results of the studies
mentioned in paragraph 4 in that security of tenure can generate benefits, including access to a wider
spectrum of financing sources for productive activities as well as for improved living conditions.
Rural Roads
13.   The benefits of rehabilitating rural roads is well documented. The World Bank reports that
up to 15 percent of production is lost between the farm gate and the consumer because of poor roads
and storage facilities, thereby reducing incomes to farmers.5 Consistent with these findings, producer
associations in the project area reported losses of up to 20 percent due to poor road conditions.
14.   One of the most comprehensive studies on the impact of rural infrastructure on economic and
social benefits is the 1990 report of the International Food Policy Research Institute titled
Development Impact of Rural Infrastructure in Bangladesh, by R. Ahrmed and M. Hossain. The
report indicates that improvements in infrastructure can increase household income by 33 percent.
The landless and small farmers reap most of the benefits from increases in agricultural production
and wages.6 Consistent with these findings, producer associations in the project area reported
transport costs due to nonexistent or poor quality roads between 10 and 15 percent higher (i.e., 10
percent for banana, 15 percent for roots and tubers, 10 percent for plantain, and 10 percent for hearts
of palm).
15.   World Bank rural roads projects further confirm the positive benefits of rural road
rehabilitation as a consequence of improved access to services. Empirical data collected for the
1991 Ghana National Feeder Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance project concludes that improved
accessibility brought about an average 20 percent increase in agricultural production.'
16.   A socioeconomic impact evaluation of rural roads conducted by OED in the Kingdom of
Morocco in 1996, within the context of the Fourth Highway Project (Loan 2254-MOR), found,
inter alia, that overall levels of agricultural activity increased in productivity of the land (up to 31

percent) and monetary values of the output. In addition, thanks to better access, the use of
agricultural extension services by small farms increased by more than four times. 8
17.   A comparison of costs in different countries with that of the Costa Rica project has not been
attempted because costs per km depend on local factors, such as distance and ease of access to
materials (in this case, gravel from nearby rivers). However, the results of an assessment of cost-
effectiveness of this and other road subcomponents (construction, upgrading and the third emergency
rehabilitation program) limited to the most recent stage of implementation of the project (i.e., works
initiated after October 1995), show that overall average costs amounted to $10,175/km, with
deviations not exceeding 12 percent between the average costs of construction, rehabilitation and
upgrading projects.9 This figure is considered a satisfactory achievement in terms of cost-
effectiveness, particularly on account of the generally modest size of contracts awarded by the
project, the constant deteriorating conditions of these roads usually due to heavy rains, and
accessibility to materials.
18.   The participatory scheme devised by the Project Coordinating Unit and supported by the
project has yielded many savings. The cost of maintenance of rural roads in the project area would
average $10,000 per km when contracted out. The project, however, was able to provide routine
maintenance at a cost of $1,250-$1,450 per km (including equipment depreciation) thanks to the
participation of the communities in the area. Their contribution to the operating costs of the
maintenance program averaged $550/km (above the established 35 percent of total costs).
19.   Based on the above, it is reasonable to conclude that the costs of the civil works financed by
the project were reasonably low, and that rehabilitation and maintenance of rural roads produced in
Costa Rica similar benefits as those demonstrated through empirical studies conducted in other
countries.
s Kingdom of Morocco, Socioeconomic Influence of Rural Roads, Impact Evaluation Report, World Bank,
Operations Evaluation Department, Report No. 15808-MOR, June 28, 1996.
9   The highest average cost corresponded to the third emergency rehabilitation subcomponent ($10,434/km).
However, this is due to the high incidence of five projects located in the Los Chiles Canton, where hauling
distances are exceptionally long and unit costs may exceed $21,000/kin.

ANNEX 1. LAND TITLING COMPONENT - CASE STUDIES
As part of the evaluation of the land titling component of the Costa Rica's Atlantico
Agricultural Development Project, 40 case studies were conducted of beneficiaries of the land titling
programs chosen from the Limon and Talamanca counties, southeast of the City of Limon (including
four sub-areas: Rio Banao-Cahuita and Cahuita-Manzanillo (coastal areas that produce maindy cocoa
and subsistence crops); Alta Talamnanca (forest conservation, fiuit production and cattle); and Baja
Talamanca (includes the productive Sixaola valley, mainly of banana, plantains and tropical fruits)). The
objective of the case studies was to evaluate the impact of land titles on the general access to credit
for the beneficiaries of the land titling program. Some tables showing important data collected
during the case studies are presented below.

1.    Claudio Gregorio (Consultant, Civil Engineer), visited Costa Rica from June 11-19, 1997.
Silvia Castro, task manager, joined the mission on June 16. The purpose of the mission was to carry
out the last supervision and implementation completion mission of the rural roads component, and the
overall project. The implementation completion review of the agricultural credit and land titling
component was done during previous missions. The mission would like to extend its thanks to officials
from the Project Administration and Coordination Unit (ACU-PRoDAZA) and the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock (MAG).
2.    IMLEMENTATION PROGRESS. The mission and the ACU developed the final version of the
progress report on rural roads, presenting the major physical and financial results of the project
component as of mid June, 1997. The final outcome of each subprogram of the component is
described below.
3.    Prodaza Program I: About 80.7 km of roadways were built or repaired, while 78 meters of
bridges were built. This subcomponent reached 96.8 percent of its original target.
4.    Emergency Rehabilitation Program I: As part of this subcomponent, 96.7 km of roads
were repaired, meeting 43 percent of the original objective. In addition, 527 meters of bridges were
repaired, compared with the original target of 260 m (+102.7 percent).
5.    Emergency Rehabilitation Program II: The two projects still pending at the end of the
previous supervision mission were finalized. This marked the completion of the Bribri - Shiroles and
San Rafael - Paraiso - Punta Uva stretch which resulted in 132.1 km of road being repaired (66.1
percent of the target).
6.    Prodaza Program II: This subcomponent included the construction of 39.3 km of roads and
upgrading of another 19 km. However, it will only be possible to complete four construction projects
(35.4 km) and to upgrade another two (8 km) before the project ends. The other civil works had to be
cancelled: two, because of unsuccessful bidding (Imperio - El Encanto - Celina and Celina - Vega del
Pacuar), and one (La Aldea - Cuatro Esquinas) because its construction was contingent upon the
construction of another stretch of roads (El Achiote - La Aldea) which had yet to be completed. This
subcomponent reached 74.4 percent of its targets.



Appendix B

7.    Emergency Rehabilitation Program III: The original goal of this subcomponent was to
repair 190 km of roads. All of the projects identified (27 in total) can be completed before project end,
except for two (La Esperanza - La Maravilla and La Maravilla - Pangola, 18 km). Bidding for these
civil works was cancelled based on an administrative resolution issued by the Comptroller's Office in
April of 1997, making it impossible for the National Emergency Commission to contract new civil
works. This subcomponent, therefore, reached 92.7 percent of its targets.
8.    Pending payments for civil works. With regard to the final payments pending for civil works
completed some time ago (see September 1996 Aide Memoire), the mission was informed that
payments had been made, and that no delay was foreseen in the payment of recently completed
contracts.
9.    Purchase of machinery and equipment for road maintenance. The mission was informed
that all equipment and machinery for maintaining and repairing roadways had been acquired. This
includes three pick-up trucks and the equipment needed for building a drainage system.
10.   Rural roadway maintenance program (PMCR): The mission had the opportunity to review
and update all the records of PMCR from September 20, 1994 (program start-up) until June 30, 1997.
The results of this analysis determined that the final rate of production was 24.7 km of roadways per
working calendar month. As of May 13, 851.1 km of roadways had received maintenance. When
compared with the objective of 1,640 km set forth in the last amendment to the Loan Agreement
(October 1995), this is not very significant. However, this objective was based on the efforts of four
maintenance crews, but only one of these was able to operate until now. The production objective
established for a single crew was 36.4 km/month and 980 km of roads. The fact that only 68 percent
of monthly production was met is justified for the reasons previously analyzed by past supervision
missions. These include frequent work stoppages due to the unavailability of personnel from the Costa
Rican Ministry of Public Works and Transportation (MOPT) and adverse weather conditions.
However, during the first months of 1997, productivity increased to 26.7 km per month (+8 percent
with respect to the average result for the entire period under consideration). Thus, it is possible that a
monthly production level closer to the one originally planned will be achieved soon.
11.   Ex-POST EVALUATION OF THE RURAL ROADS COMPONENT. The mission, accompanied by
the Director of the ACU, had the opportunity to meet with A.MA.CA.RU.VA. directors and visit three
program sites (La Uni6n, Pav6n and Cuatro Esquinas). They were able to talk with representatives
from various community associations, affiliated with A.MA.CA.RU.VA., that use these rural roadways.
As a result of interviews and discussions, the following conclusions were reached:
(a)   Although it was not possible to carry out a systematic survey on the results of this project
component and its benefits to rural road users, there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence
showing that the construction/repair of more than 550 km of roads (or 1,300 if stretches in the
PMCR program are counted) as part of PRODAZA has created important new opportunities in
agricultural production. In particular, it has opened up new options for transporting crops to
market from areas that were previously only used to raise livestock. It has also been extremely
helpful in improving the living conditions of the communities involved.



Appendix B
Page 3 of 4
(b)   As a result of the creation and implementation of the PMCR, PRODAZA was subsequently able
to generate a concrete change in the mentality and behavior of the communities that use these
roads. Previously, these communities only received support from public agencies in
maintaining their road networks. As a result of the program, they became aware of the need to
be directly involved in this process, by helping to meet costs and working to carry out routine
and special maintenance works. This conclusion is evidenced by the high number
(approximately 250) of requests for affiliation submitted to date to A.MA.CA.RU.VA.
12.   The mission concluded that the ACU was successful in establishing an adequate base for the
future operations of the PMCR after the project ends. This was set forth in the MOPT-MAG-
A.MA.CA.RU.VA. agreement recently signed by the Comptroller General. It should be pointed out that
as part of the agreement, the MOPT and the MAG will provide the PMCR with all the equipment and
machinery needed to maintain these roadways, as well as the transport vehicles and office equipment
and buildings that were originally acquired with resources from the World Bank's loan. The
agreement further stipulates that these maintenance projects will only be carried out if users, local
government offices and other interested organizations cover at least 35% of the costs incurred.
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS OF THE EX-POST EVALUATION
13.   The ACU organized a working meeting with representatives of the executing agencies (Banco
Nacional, IDA), during which the mission presented a summary of its conclusions, and took note of the
executing agencies' comments regarding the implementation of the project. Unfortunately, the MOPT
representative did not take part in the meeting, and, therefore, it was not possible to discuss the rural
roadways component.
14.   In general, the mission concluded that: (a) the instrument chosen, namely agricultural credit.
was one but not the only input necessary for reaching the project's objective of increasing exports from
the Atlantic Zone; (b) the project design was not well-suited to channeling investment resources to
small producers; (c) the land titling program was highly successful and surpassed its goals by almost
50 percent; (d) the road maintenance program was extremely successful and should be used as a model
for other parts of Costa Rica; (e) the project resulted in a network of roadways for significantly low-
income populations that raised their standard of living by making it possible for them to take their
products to market, and that also yielded highly important secondary social effects; and (f) the most
successful project components were those that received the least financial resources (i.e., land titling
and rural road maintenance program).
15.   The mission was unable to determine fully the project's success in meeting its objectives with
project-specific statistical data, because only physical indicators were used during the first phase of the
project, and, during the second phase, the scheduled impact study could not be carried out. However,
anecdotal evidence provided by producers in the area and statistical data on export crops provided by
Costa Rica's Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock indicate that exports of traditional as well as non-
traditional crops have increased substantially in the Atlantic Region, which may be partly attributed to
the project.
16.   The rural roads maintenance component is the only component expected to continue after the
World Bank loan is closed. The operating plan is in the process of being drawn up and will soon be
sent to the Bank.

17.   Comments from the implementing agencies focused on: (a) difficulties with public
administration processes; (b) budget ceilings that prevented activities from being carried out; (c) lack
of preparation for the project; which was originally designed as a large integrated rural development
project but was scaled down some years later for no apparent reason; (d) lack of a needs assessment
study related to land titling; (e) a credit program that was not very flexible until late into project
implementation when supervision missions adjusted it to meet the borrowers' needs; and (f) credit
geared towards spurring the production of nontraditional crops that did not take into account the fact
that many producers had no experience in growing these two crops (coconut and cocoa).

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
COSTA RICA
Atlantico Agricultural Development Project (Loan 2764-CR)
BORROWER'S IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
(Translated from Spanish)
INTRODUCTION
This document is the Borrower's Implementation Completion Report for the Agricultural
Development Project of the Atlantic Region, approved by the Board of Directors of the World
Bank (loan IBRD 2764-CR) on October 21, 1986, for an amount of US$26 million. The Loan
Agreement became effective on October 4, 1988. In 1995, at the request of the Borrower, the
loan amount was reduced to US$22.85 million.
The loan closed on June 30, 1997, three years after the original loan closing date (June 30,
1994). The last disbursement took place on October 3, 1997, at which time a balance of
US$2.2 million was cancelled.
This Implementation Completion Report was prepared by the Direcci6n de Proyectos del
Programa de Desarrollo Rural (Project Management Unit of the Rural Development
Program) with the support of the technical staff of the Project Coordinating Unit and with
information provided by the executing agencies.
The purpose of this report is to present the opinion of the Borrower regarding the project with
respect to the following:
(a)   Evaluation of the objectives, design, and implementation of the project.
(b)   Evaluation of its own performance during the identification, preparation and
implementation of the project, emphasizing useful lessons learned.
(c)   Evaluation of the performance of the World Bank during project identification,
preparation and implementation, including an opinion regarding the relationship
between the Borrower and the Bank, emphasizing lessons learned that would be
useful for similar projects in the fiture.
A.   PROJECT OBJECTIES
1.    The main objective of PRODAZA (Proyecto de Desarrollo Agricola de la Zona
Atlantica) was to contribute to the economic development of the Atlantic Region of Costa



Appendix C
Page 2 of 8
Rica by expanding the agricultural production base with nontraditional crops of high export
potential. To achieve this objective, the project included the following components:
(d)   Credit Line. With an original allocation of US$22 million of the World Bank
loan, the project would provide agricultural credit to finance the development
of new planting of 2,500 ha, the rehabilitation of about 3,000 ha of existing
cocoa trees, and replanting of about 1,500 ha. As a result of several
amendments to the Project Agreement, the list of eligible crops was expanded,
and the allocation of the loan amount was substantially reduced from the US$22
million to US$9 million. The executing agency was the Banco Nacional de
Costa Rica (BNCR).
(e)   Land Titling. The Instituto de Desarrollo Agrario (IDA) implemented this
component which had an original allocation of US$0.3 million of the World
Bank loan. The objective of this component was to solve the problem of
access to traditional sources of credit due to a lack of property titles. This
problem was evident in more than 20 percent of the farmers in the Atlantic
Area. Consequently, the project intended to issue about 1,600 land titles. As a
result of amendments to the Loan Agreement, by project end more than 4,600
titles had been issued, and the allocation of the loan amount had been increased
from $0.3 million to US$0.7 million.
(f)   Rural Roads. The objective of the rural roads component was the construction
or rehabilitation of a network of about 105 km of priority feeder roads,
necessary for the development of the agricultural activity supported by the
project. The Ministry of Public Works (MOPT) was the implementing agency,
and the original allocation was US$2.2 million of the World Bank loan. Once
these roads were rehabilitated, a rural road maintenance program was started
with an active community participation. As a result of amendments to the Loan
Agreements, the activities and goals of this component were modified to allow
the construction, rehabilitation and improvement of 780 km of rural roads and
maintenance of a network of 1,640 km of existing roads. The allocation of the
loan amount was increased from US$2.2 million to US$12.1 million.
(g)   Other Related Activities. About US$0.3 million of the loan amount was
allocated to sector studies, US$0.2 million to strengthening of the Project
Coordinating Unit (PCU), and US$0.6 million were unallocated.
B.   ASSESSMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTrVES
2.    Overall, the objectives of the project were technically and politically appropriate for the
country's agricultural policy of that time, and endorsed by the international organizations.
However, there were many changes in the international economic order, and Costa Rica also
had to deal with unfortunate catastrophes caused by natural phenomena like the Lim6n
earthquake, Hurricanes Joan and Caesar, and other phenomena of lesser impact but still



Appendix C

important for the Region. Obviously, these factors had an impact on the original design of the
project leading to considerable setbacks in the achievement of its stated objectives. This
experience proves that the availability of agricultural credit services to pump up the regional
economy was not, in itself, the instrument that would secure the expansion of the agricultural
production base. It was more important, instead, to solve the problem of access to these
services and increase the knowledge and availability of market information that would guide
development. In this context, the Central and Local Governments (Municipalities) did not
succeed, as expected, in taking care of the rural road network to facilitate an active exchange
of goods and services that would improve the marketing of nontraditional export crops.
3.    One of the most important factors to consider in this report is the design of the project.
Although the behavior of the economy in the past ten years was very dynamic, the changes
experienced and recorded in the different Amendments to the Loan and Project Agreements
and in the Implementation Completion Report (ICR), show deficiencies in the original design
of the project. This is evidenced primarily by the fact that economic success was linked to the
financial profitability of cocoa and coconut crops at the time. Neither the project's cash flows
nor internal rates of return were useful mostly because of an onset of monilia roreri and the
drop in the international price of cocoa. Cocoa cropping in the Atlantic Region of Costa Rica
is more like an inheritance that provides its owners with a free- or a low-cost crop than an
agricultural activity practiced with appropriate technologies. Coconut as a shared crop with
cocoa was not an activity already practiced in the country although, from a purely financial
perspective, it was very attractive for PRODAZA's potential beneficiaries. To pretend a
cultural change in producers' behavior through the implementation of a limited time project is a
fault in the design that shows itself in the final outcome of the credit component, where credit
granted for these two crops was practically nil.
4.    By design, the project kept technical assistance and follow-up to the activities financed
with the credit line outside the purview of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG).
Instead, this responsibility was given to the Banco Nacional de Costa Rica (BNCR) on the
assumption that technology transfer to project beneficiaries would be done by monitoring
credit operations, and that BNCR was able to defray the costs of this service. In fact, the
institution limited its role to the provision of credit without a structured program of technical
assistance to support project beneficiaries. Consequently, the Borrowers of the project's
agricultural credit line had to resort to other sources for technical assistance.
5.    The social group that actually benefited from the line of credit was not the group
targeted by the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR). The SAR had estimated that about 30 percent
of the credit funds would benefit small producers. At project end, only 10.1 percent of the
funds had gone to small producers. Moreover, it was expected that the remaining funds would
benefit the lower echelon of medium-size producers which were defined as producers with
annual income between C160,000-170,000 (1985 prices). The World Bank ICR indicates that,
in fact, the number of subloans granted to medium-size producers represented about 70.8
percent, but the characteristics of these producers were not the same as those identified in the
SAR. Finally, about 19.1 percent of all subloans went to large producers who, overall,
received 52.1 percent of all credit funds. These considerable differences between expected and



Appendix C
Page 4 of 8
actual results reveal shortcomings in the design of the credit component and show how the
main project component affected overall project performance.
6.    The fact that more than 3,000 titles were granted over the goal in the Land Titling
Component proves once again how the design of the project identified, only superficially, the
target group and the supporting activities that were needed to improve the level of income and
the quality of life of the beneficiaries. This explains why only 17 percent of all subloans were
granted to small producers during the life of the project.
7.    The Rural Roads Component was a positive feature of the project's design. However,
the extensive road network to be built or rehabilitated was underestimated, and the size of the
component was inadequate, which resulted in several amendments to the original Loan
Agreement. Other problems related to the project design were the relatively low attention
given to this component among the priorities of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport
(MOPT) as well as the absence of a monitoring system, and control and supervision of the
works contracted out according to the Roads Code CR-77.
C.   ACHIEVEMEENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Achievements and Goals of the Agricultural Credit Component
8.    As a result of the variation in the international price of cocoa and coconut, this
component had to be amended to extend the Project area to cover the northern region of the
country and to open the credit line to other export crops. Under these new conditions, it was
possible to finance export crops in 4,484 has which represent about 64 percent of SAR target.
The size of the subloans was, however, three times larger than expected, which resulted in
fewer farms benefiting from the project; of a target of 1,040 farms, only 168 actually benefited
from the credit line. It should be noted that from these 168 subloans, only five are under legal
collection, and another five are of doubtful recovery. Despite the disincentives of the cocoa
and coconut production mentioned earlier, the project had a direct impact on regional
production by financing new export crops like citrus, hearts of palm and ornamental plants, but
its most important achievement was to disseminate knowledge in the Project area.
Achievements and Goals of the Land Titling Component
9.    Land titling in the Project area was one of the activities of larger social impact since it
provided security of tenure to the beneficiaries and thus facilitated access to credit.
Unfortunately, the farmers who benefited from this component did not have the expected
access to the project's credit line through BNCR because the Credit Regulations of the
Component (e.g., minimum annual income, collateral and cofinancing share) were not
appropriate for this type of beneficiary. On the other hand, the credit line was canceled just
one year after the first titles had been granted. The performance of the Instituto de Desarrollo
Agrario (IDA) as implementing agency was outstanding in that it was able to issue and deliver
6,251 titles by June 1997, compared to the SAR's original target of 1,600 titles. IDA was able
to issue these many titles thanks to an increase from US$300,000 to US$700,000 in the
amount of Loan funds allocated to this component.



Appendix C
Page 5 of 8
Achievements and Goals of the Rural Roads Component
10.   The SAR indicated that the goals of this component were the rehabilitation of 105 km
of main rural roads to support the free transport of goods and services needed to increase the
production of export crops. As a consequence of the telluric and climatic phenomena that the
country faced, especially in the Atlantic Region, the Government and the World Bank agreed
on a number of amendments to the Loan and Project Agreements that enabled the project to
finance 780 km of infrastructure works, and to maintain a network of 1,640 km of existing
roads. The original amount allocated to civil works increased during project implementation
from US$2.2 million to US$12.1 million. MOPT was responsible for this component.
Implementation of the road and bridges infrastructure suffered from significant delays due to
adverse climatic conditions, delays between the Borrower and the World Bank in reaching
agreement on the scope of the environmental impact assessments of some roads and, mainly,
because of the very slow Government procurement processes followed for contracting civil
works.
11.   The Loan Agreement specified the purchase of machinery and equipment to provide
maintenance to about 105 km of priority feeder roads. The crew in charge of this work started
working in June 1993 under the direction of MOPT. The first results were not encouraging
because of the lack of a concerted program between the local governments (municipalities) and
the civil society. In October 1994, the road maintenance program was transferred to the PCU.
Under this new modality and with the active participation of the communities through the
Asociaci6n de Mantenimiento de Caminos Rurales de la Vertiente Atlantica
(AMACARUVA), monthly maintenance programs were established and agreed upon, and
financed with project funds (65 percent) and community funding (35 percent in labor, kind,
and/or cash). Thanks to the success of this program, the Loan Agreement was amended to
increase to 1,640 km the network of roads to receive maintenance under the project, and to
provide the program with equipment for three new maintenance crews. After these changes to
the Loan Agreement, the production ratio increased to 27 km/month per crew, and, by project
end, about 70 percent of the target had been reached with just one crew in operation. Since
October 1997 all four maintenance crews are equipped and operating. It is expected that the
goal of 1,640 km will be achieved and, depending on weather conditions, even surpassed.
D.    BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
12.   The BNCR had a good performance even considering the delays in presenting to the
World Bank the Operating Manual of the Agricultural Credit Line. Since the approval of this
manual, implementation of the credit line was smooth and the investments financed were
successful in broadening the productive base of traditional and nontraditional export crops.
The only negative factor in the performance of BNCR is not to have developed and
implemented a permanent program of technical assistance to complement its credit services.
13.   The institutional performance of IDA was very efficient and succeeded in surpassing
the project goals and objectives. Among other factors, this success should be credited to the
high priority that the institution assigned to this component and the outstanding performance
of the Titling Director.



Appendix C
Page 6 of 8
14.   The PCU showed an outstanding commitment in carrying out its functions. Despite the
difficulty of coordinating a project with autonomous executing agencies, the PCU succeeded in
taking the project to a good end. It is worth noting the PCU's commendable efforts in
identifying and implementing mechanisms that encouraged the participation of the organized
rural communities, thus ensuring the sustainability of the Rural Roads Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Program.
E.    PERFORMANCE OF THE WORLD BANK
15.   The evaluation of the performance of the World Bank has to be done in two stages:
one, the identification, design and negotiation of the project, and the other, the project's
implementation and completion phases. During the first stage, the performance of the World
Bank cannot be rated efficient largely due to the modifications that the project concept
suffered during a 10-year gestational period, evolving from an integrated rural development
project for rural settlers into an agricultural development project. Finally, the approved
project is a credit project targeted to the agricultural sector, that includes a rural roads and a
land titling component with no apparent synergy among the components. The World Bank
also failed to involve the BNCR adequately in the preparation and appraisal stages, giving IDA
the responsibility for the design of the credit component. Regardless of the final project
concept, agricultural credit would have always been an important input to achieve the project's
objectives.
16.   The identification of the target group is one of the weaknesses found in the formulation
and appraisal stages, and it is an important factor to assess the performance of the World
Bank. In light of the final outcome, it is possible to see that the beneficiaries of the land titling
and the credit program were different, and it is not clear that the beneficiaries of the roads
component belonged to either group.
17.   The roads component showed considerable inconsistencies during the formulation and
appraisal stages. The SAR, based on the field reports of a consultant hired to design this
component, indicates that the road network in the Atlantic Region does not have the
conditions to foster the development of export crops. However, in the original project design,
only 104.4 km of roads were included either for construction or rehabilitation. This
inconsistency between the diagnostic report of the consultant and the number of kilometers of
roads included in the component clearly indicates deficiencies in the appraisal of the project.
18.   The performance of the World Bank during project implementation may be rated
satisfactory, particularly because of its prompt response to the Borrower at times of
unforeseen circumstances and to the requests of amendments to correct deficiencies in the
project design. This flexibility of the World Bank is clearly shown by the nine amendments
approved to the Loan and Project Agreements and by the five extensions granted to the Loan
closing date. Thanks to the amendments, it was possible to expand the credit line to cover
other export crops, expand the Project area to cover the northern area of the country, move
from a fixed interest rate for bank credit to a variable interest rate consistent with the national
policy for agricultural credit, and to reallocate funds to increase the number of land titles to be



Appendix C
Page 7 of 8
granted. The World Bank also responded promptly to the problems caused by the natural
disasters that occurred during project implementation.
19.   As a result of the Bank's performance through its supervision missions, it was possible
to restructure the project in 1995. This restructuring provided a better chance to achieve the
project objectives, and increased the likelihood of sustainability by integrating the civil society
(AMACARUVA) in the definition and implementation of the Rural Roads Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Program of the Atlantic Region.
F.    OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF OUTcOME
20.   Despite the problems mentioned above in the identification, formulation, appraisal and
implementation of the project, the Borrower rates the project outcome as very satisfactory.
The project clearly succeeded in expanding the production of agricultural export products, and
although the project did not have any social goals, the land titling and the roads rehabilitation
and maintenance program did generate many social benefits for the people in the Project area.
Finally, the experience that the Borrower and, particularly, the executing agencies, acquired
during the implementation of this project represents the best of all achievements.
G.   USEFUL LESSONS LEARNED
(a)   The identification, formulation and appraisal of a project has to involve, from
the very beginning, all the agencies that would have a role in project
implementation to ensure that they are fully aware of their responsibilities.
(b)   There should be a synergy among the different project components so that the
beneficiaries of one component are also the beneficiaries of all other
components.
(c)   In formulating the objectives of the project as well as of the different
components, concepts of sustainability should be incorporated to ensure that
economic development is truly sustainable, socially equitable and
environmentally safe.
(d)   To get the best executing agencies on board, the selection should be based on a
detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the different institutions.
(e)   Projects should have their own financial resources to hire staff thus avoiding the
unnecessary rotation of people from government agencies.
(f)    Agriculture or rural development projects should be very flexible so that they
can be adapted to the dynamic activities that these projects try to promote. To
this effect, an adequate monitoring and evaluation system must be in place so
that project authorities may adapt the project as circumstances change over
time.



Appendix C
Page 8 of 8
(g)   A good inter-institutional relationship between the Borrower and the World
Bank would always guarantee the success of a project. Not only would this
ensure that the project would be revised as needed, but also that emergency
situations caused by climatic and telluric factors would be taken care of
(h)   The design of agricultural projects must incorporate the concept of vertical
production to ensure a higher value added in the regional economy.
(i)   The opinion of the beneficiaries regarding project impact should be
incorporated in the evaluations to encourage improvements in the project
strategy.
()   New project designs should include the participation of non-government
organizations in partnership with the Central Government and Municipalities in
project implementation.
