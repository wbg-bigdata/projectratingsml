                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project seeks to increase confidence and lower transaction costs by building a more efficient property registration andcadastresystem, with the purpose of
                         contributing to the development of effective real property markets. This will be achievedthrough two components: Operational Development and Support (including
                         formation of the real estate cadastre in priority urbanareas, support for secondary transaction system, focused support for the REC in Belgrade, IT systems
                         modernization, and legalextension services); and Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening (including public awareness campaigns, businessplanning, training,
                         IT strategy, legal framework completion).

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to build a more efficient property registration and cadastre system, with the purpose of contributing to the development of real property

                         the PDO indicators the project is meeting its targets. The PDO indicators expected approximately a 25% increase in the: number of transactions; proportion of transaction that
                         involved mortgages; and customer satisfaction. The number of transactions increased by 27% and the percentage of mortgages to 24% in 2011; and the services provided by RGZ
                         are now considered to be third amongst the most trustworthy institutions in Serbia behind the church and police. It should be noted that the percentage increase in transactions has
                         been higher than the 2011 figure, but the real estate market was affected by the overall financial crisis. Doing business 2012 records Serbia as the most improved country in the world

                         for registering property in 2011, moving to rank 39 from rank 98. Indeed in 2005 when records for registering property were first introduced by Doing Business, it was recorded that
                         registering property took 186 days in Serbia, whereas Doing Business records that it takes 11 days in 2012. It should also be noted that the time taken within RGA is only one of the
                         procedures that Doing Business takes into account, and that it records this procedure within RGA as taking 5 days if 'urgent procedure' fees are paid. Five days is the target that was
                         set to be achieved at the beginning of the project.
                         Real Estate Cadastre (REC) coverage has reached 98 percent of all cadastral municipalities (CMs) in Serbia, while the REC creation in the remaining 2 percent of the CMs is
                         ongoing . Republic Geodetic Authority realistically targets to complete all REC creation work by the Project closure, which was extended to February 29, 2012.
                         The cadastre map conversion program has been very successfully achieved and it substantially exceeds the Project targets. The current level of digitalization has reached 100
                         percent for scanned raster maps, while digital vectorized cadastre maps will be digitally maintained in 50 percent of CMs, covering 41 percent of the country territory by the end of the
                         Project.
                         There are two areas where improvements could have been made. (i) The contract for the unified software and modern ICT system for REC was canceled because of non-
                         performance by the contractor and therefore improvements to the efficiency of the registration service could have been better; and (ii) there is room to improve the perception of the
                         quality of services by the clients. Recent customer surveys showed that the public found the procedures overly complex and some were not convinced about the ultimate value of
                         registering their rights.
                         RGA management remains committed to meeting the 5 days service standard and several steps are being taken to reduce the time needed for registration, such as: i) introducing the
                         “urgent? procedure for a standard sale registration, and for an increased fee; ii) establishing RGA “windows? in urban municipalities where citizens can submit their request for
                         cadastre services; and iii) providing a citizen with a text message notification when the request is processed. RGA is in the process of modifying it's Information Technology strategy
                         in order to make improved services more standard and transparent, and have developed a stepwise approach to the development of a centralized ICT system ensuring web-access
                         to the REC data and e-services. The IP rating had been at moderately satisfactory level because the previous IT system development contract had to be canceled and it was unclear
                         how the RGA were going to proceed. Now that a strategy has been developed it is reasonable to upgrade the IP status to satisfactory.
