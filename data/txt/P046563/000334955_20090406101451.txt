This Technical Assistance (TA) is entitled, "Integrated Environmental Management in the
Tarim Basin (IEMTB), Xinjiang Province (XP or Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region),
China". Funding was provided by AusAid in response to a request by the World Bank (WB)
to facilitate its support of the Chinese authorities' wholistic planning of water resource
rehabilitation and use in the Tarim River Basin (TRB) in relation to the WB hnded "Tarim
Basin I1 Project" (TB 11).

The TA is to ensure as far as possible that the sustainable environmental management goals of
the Governments of the Peoples' Republic of China (PRC), XP and the relevant Prefectures,
can rest on the best available information and an objective assessment of the value of the
Lower Green Corridor (LGC) of the Tarim River (TR) in ecological and socio-economic
terms.

                                EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


The Lower Green Corridor (LGC) is that area of the Tarim River and its floodplain,
downstream of Qiala. It is approximately 428 km long and generally 3 to 10 km in width. By
comparison, the entire Tarim River is 1,320 km long and has a floodplain up to 30 km wide.
The LGC used to support about YI of the Tarim River's total area of poplar diversifolia
(Populus diversifolia, Schenk), in addition to Tamarix woodlands and grass and shrub lands.
These woodlands and grasslands were important resources for the Uygur herders (about 2000
in the 1950s) who depended on the natural cycle of flooding to maintain these ecosystems in a
healthy condition for grazing, fishing, wood, herbs and other needs. There are now more than
40,000 people on State Farms in the LGC, but very few herders because of the almost total
loss of grazing land over the past 20 years.

Reductions in the average annual volumes of water supplied to the LGC are the main cause of
the decline in its ecological health and grazing land condition. Although this has been
occurring along the entire GC the impact is most noticeable downstream of Qiala and
particularly downstream of Daxihai.

Within the LGC almost all trees between Alegan and Taitema Lake, the lower third of the
LGC, are dead and those between Yinsu and Alegan are severely stressed or dying. Taitema
Lake is dry and there is no pasture. In the middle third, between Daxihaizi Reservoir and
Alegan, only the trees and pasture near the reservoir are in moderate condition, due to
groundwater fed by seepage from the reservoir and irrigation. The upper third, between Qiala
and Daxihaizi Reservoir, is also in moderate condition, again due to seepage to groundwater
from the Qiala Reservoir and irrigation. Secondary impacts of the flow reductions are over-
grazing of the degraded pastures and secondary salinisation due to lack of soil flushing and
increased river salinities.

It is not possible to save the entire LGC without reinstating annual flow volumes that
approach the magnitude of those that occurred in and before the 1950s. Upward trending river
salinity levels also need to be stabilised and reduced. Grazing pressures need to be matched to
the reduced carrying capacities.

Significant rehabilitation, however, can be achieved if average annual flows of 300 x 106m3
can be reinstated as provided for in the recent Water Allocation Agreement, agreed to by the
Prefectures at the "Second Standing Committee for the Tarim River Prefecture Water Use"
held in January, 1999 - a committee of the Tarim Basin Water Resources Commission.
Although an annual average flow of 300 x lo6m3 is about 'A of the average flow in the 1950s
and perhaps 118 of the flow prior to any irrigation use in the Tarim Basin, it is estimated that
300 x lo6 m3 would largely restore the condition of the trees and pasture from Qiala to Yinsu,
with partial recovery between there and Alegan. There would be little benefit downstream of
Alegan and effectively no ecologically useful change at Taitema Lake. Initially such flows
would need to be augmented to raise groundwater levels that have been reduced over the past
20 years since flows to the LGC effectively ceased.            If these initial flows cannot be
augmented, then it will take longer for the restoration to be achieved.

In addition to restoring flows, there is a need to spread and hold water on the floodplain for
sufficient time for the natural flora to re-establish. Natural floods had the high discharges
needed to do this. The restoration flows envisaged do not, and artificial structures in the
Tarim River coupled with flood runners will be required if the height of the water in the river
is to be raised and the water is to be spread over the flood plain.

Executive Summary                                                                         1

Quantifying the socio-economic value of the LGC, however was restricted due to limited and
incomplete data. In socio-economic terms sufficient evidence was gathered to suggest that the
case to restore, save or even sustain the LGC downstream of Daxihaizi is very weak. None of
the options investigated for delivering water to the LGC had a positive NPV at the discount
rates considered.    In effect all options will impose a cost on the Chinese economy if
implemented. That cost is significant, in two ways. First, there will be lost socio-economic
opportunities. It will cost the Chinese economy to save or partially restore the LGC and these
finds could be better used to benefit the Chinese economy if they were used in other
productive ways. Second, and due to transmission inefficiencies, unless the water required is
sourced from the Kongque River, attempting to save or partially restore even some of the
LGC, will cause more GC to be lost in higher reaches than can be saved or restored in the
LGC.

Sustaining the GC along the higher reaches of the TR, however, has a relatively strong socio-
economicjustification

Analysis of the current condition of the LGC, its value in ecological and socio-economic
terms, and the underlying causal factors is severely constrained by the available data. No
quantified flow records exist prior to 1957 anywhere on the Tarim River but large scale
irrigation water use existed prior to the 1950s. Hydrologic modelling is therefore needed to
estimate the scale and nature of pre-1950 flows and link these with post 1950 data. There is
only one flow recording station in the LGC and this is not a National Level station. 'The
quality of data from this station might not match that of the National Level river monitoring
stations at Aler and Xinqiman. There is even less information on water quality and biological
parameters.

Data constraints are not unusual in river basin studies but in this case finding arrangements
have caused data to become a "commodity" to be purchased to augment agency funds. This
has given rise to a lack of interagency data exchange and a degree of adversarial competition
between agencies to protect their perceived areas of responsibilities and expertise. This is not
an efficient use of data or resources and results in a large, long-term economic cost to the
Tarim Basin and the XUAR through inefficient policies and poor use of available natural
resources. It seriously constrained this analysis and prevented the development of a better
understanding of how the system works and how the prevailing condition of the GC in general
and the LGC in particular came to be.           It is an important issue because river basin
management, by nature, is multi-disciplinary and requires a great deal of cooperation and
interaction that at present simply does not exist.


The greatest need for monitoring in the future is to first correct data access and sharing
arrangements so that a multi-disciplinary, inter-agency approach can make f i l l use of past and
hture data. Without such changes there will be little value in collecting more data.


There is aneed for much stronger coordination and oversight of water quality monitoring in
the Tarim Basin. The TBWRC should have a much stronger role (similar to the Murray-
Darling Basin Commission in Australia) in this regard and be responsible for coordinating
Basin-wide data collection and management. The actual monitoring should be conducted by
existing agencies within this coordinated holistic framework provided by the TBWRC.

Second, new data need to be collected with specific issues and hypotheses of the biophysical,
socio-economic and management /administrative systems in mind.              All three of these


Executive Summary                                                                          2

hypotheses need to be developed in an interactive manner involving all relevant stakeholders
and managers. The TMB will require additional support for it to manage such processes,
coordinate data gathering and archiving, and use the analytical modules and systems needed to
support TBWRC operations.




Executive Summary

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 PROJECT CONTEXT
The "Lower Green Corridor" (LGC) is the area naturally and artificially irrigated by the Tarim
River, downstream of Qiala Reservoir to Taitema Lake, i.e. it is the Tarim River and its
floodplain, including flood channels and "dry rivers". This area is surrounded by the Kuluk
Desert to the east and the Taklimakan Desert to the west (Figure 1). A full description is
provided in Section 2.

The World Bank funded Tarim Basin I Project (completed in 1997) and Tarim Basin I1Project
(in progress) are intended to achieve socio-economic benefits for poor farmers through
sustainable rehabilitation and development of irrigated agriculture. The projects also aim to
improve the greatly deteriorated environment of the "Green Corridor", which, at least at one
time, had considerable socio-economic and ecological values.

This Technical Assistance (TA), "Integrated Environmental Management in the Tarim Basin,
Xinjiang Province, China", relates to whether and 'how water saved through the structural and
management measures of the Tarim I1 Project could be used to improve the environmental
condition of the LGC and thereby socio-economic conditions. The TA was also to quantify
the ecological and socio-economic values, so that rational and objective decisions can be
made about the reallocation of the scarce water resource saved through component projects of
the Tarim Basin I1 Project. The five objectives of the TA are listed in Section 1.2.

Package 1 of this TA is to provide a preliminary assessment of these values and criteria, and
establish a framework for an environmental monitoring program that can be conducted
through the Tarim I1 Project. It also recommends specific environmental research studies to
be conducted as part of Package I1 of this Technical Assistance. Package I1 is tentatively
scheduled to begin in late 1999. This report is part of Package 1.


1.2 OBJECTIVES
The Tarim Basin Green Corridor Environmental Management component of Package I has
the following objective:

    To identifi the broad constraints within which current andfuture development can occur
   without further destroying the Tarim River's environmental assets and to identlfi
   opportunitiesfor restoration or enhancement.

Through the preparation of an environmental baseline study, five specific objectives will be
addressed:

 1. To determine the major changes in the extent and character of the Tarim River and its
    "green corridor" since the inception of large scale water use and river regulation.

2. To make a preliminary assessment of the value of the river and "green corridor" in
    ecological and socio-economic terms.

3. To determine the broad water quality and quantity conditions that will maintain or restore
    the ecosystems of the Tarim River and its "green corridor" to levels that match agreed local
    and regional expectations.

4. To input environmental values, constraints and management options to the development of
    the Tarim Basin Master Plan primarily at the Insight Workshop.

5. To identify a framework for the development of monitoring needs and make
   recommendations for the environmental studies to be conducted in Package 2.



2. WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF THE LOWER GREEN CORRIDOR?

2.1 THE "TAIIIM RIVER HOTPOT"

The Tarim River (TR) can be likened to a frog in a pot of cold water. The story goes that if
you heat it slowly enough the frog will not notice that the water is getting warmer and will
remain oblivious to the danger until it is cooked. Similarly, changes to the TR have been very
gradual. The damage was not done "yesterday". It has developed progressively over much of
this century and started even before river flow and other records began to be kept.

And now the "Tarim River Hot Pot" is more than half cooked. It is almost forgotten that the
TR used to flow, not just to Taitema Lake, but joined by the flows of the Qarqan River,
flowed a considerable distance further, at least in wet years, to Lop Nor Lake (Figure 1). That
lake was two to three times the size of Bosten Lake earlier this century, but by the 1970's was
dry. The reduction in TR and Kongque River flows were both responsible'.

The deterioration of the Lower Green Corridor (LGC), i.e. that section from Qiala to Taitema
~ a k eis~just the most visible sign of the problem. The remainder of the Tarim River's (TRYs)
            ,
Green Corridor (GC),from Aler downstream and those of its tributaries, are also significantly
degraded, but because of the "s1owness of the cooking", it has largely gone unnoticed and
consequently there has been little retrospective action.

There is a danger in concentrating on the obvious deterioration in the LGC, the complete lack
of water downstream of Daxihaizi Reservoir, the dead and dying trees, the encroaching desert,
and ignoring the effects of increasing river salinities, land salinisation and deteriorating
groundwater levels and quality. These are secondary causal factors in the deterioration of the
whole GC, not just the LGC, due to the primary cause of reduced water availability. It is as
important to understand the mechanisms of deterioration, as it is to know the extent and
severity of the consequences. By understanding the mechanisms, predictions can be made and
early warning signs recognised in areas less severely affected. Management can then be
targeted to address these problems knowing the full scale of the issues, what integrated
management is needed and what trade-offs are necessary. It also provides the advantage of
proactive management in being able to prevent further deterioration, rather than attempt
restoration after the damage has been done.



2.2 WHAT 1S THE CUlIRENT CONDlTlON OF THE LOWER GREEN
CORRIDOR?
The lower one third of the LGC, between Alegan and Taitema Lake is already largely dead.
There is no pasture and most of the poplar diversifolia trees are dead or nearly so. Mobile

' The Kongque River flowed separately to Lop Nor Lake via a more northerly route, but also used to contribute
flows to the lower TR in the vicinity of Qiala, via Aksupu Swamp and Tiganlike, via the Ailik River (now dry).

 The former extent to Lop Nor is being ignored in this study in terms of any attempts to recover it. The volumes
of water required would approach those volumes that originally flowed. The re-allocation of water on that scale
is outside the terms of reference of this study and is, to all intents and purposes, impractical.

dunes have formed over some of the 7,000 ha of abandoned irrigated farmland and in the bed
of the TR at Alegan.

In the middle third of the LGC, between Daxihaizi Reservoir and Alegan, the pasture has
deteriorated to the extent that only six of the original 28 grazed species remain and there is
only temporary occupation of Yinsu each year by a few families. Grazing is now restricted to
11,000 ha of the                     278,000 ha of grass and bush area. It is being maintained almost
entirely by groundwater. However, the groundwater levels are progressively becoming deeper
and most of this remaining area, including the tree cover, is likely to be lost to within a short
distance of Daxihaizi Reservoir if regular flooding is not provided within 5 to 10 years4.
Water levels in wells in the river bed at Yinsu are more than 6 m deep, or more than 10 m
below the general floodplain level5. Between Yinsu and Alegan tree condition is poor and
there is evidence of wind erosion of alluvial sediments, reflecting the lack of grass cover and
absence of flooding. Currently the mature trees are still in moderate condition upstream of
Yinsu, but there is essentially no establishment of new trees.



' This "original" area is calculated from the "Map of the Landscape of the Tarim River Drainage Area". A
full reference is provided in the References section. The date of the photography or satellite imagery that this
map is based on is not known, but is likely to be relatively recent. Therefore the original extent of grassland in
particular (less so for forest), could have been greater, i.e. the areas quoted in this report based on this map are
likely to be conservative.

  This is a project estimate based on the biological information provided and the time which it has taken for the
currently observed deterioration in tree health to occur at Yinsu, i.e. within 10years of the last decent flood.

  Obsen~ationduring a TA field trip 7 April 1999.

The upper third of the LGC, between Qiala and Daxihaizi Reservoirs, is in moderately good
condition due to both surface and groundwater flows being maintained by irrigation water,
albeit with different time and spatial patterns relative to the natural flows and floods that once
characterised the TR. The flow of surface water in the river and in the main and subsidiary
irrigation canals, all assist in maintaining groundwater levels, as do the major area-based
recharge sources of the Qiala and Daxihaizi Reservoirs and the irrigation areas of the five
State Farms.

River salinity levels range between 1 - 3 g/l (measured as "mineralisati~n"~).They appear to
have increased since the 1960's. Land salinisation is a significant issue. It is perhaps less
prevalent in the upper third of the LGC than in the middle GC although relatively high salinity
levels in the upper third of the LGC have forced the use of deep groundwater for drinking
water.


2.3 WHAT ARE THE CAUSAL RIECHANISMS?

The entire TR has an extremely arid continental climate and therefore experiences high
summer temperatures of 30 to 4 0 ' ~daily maximums and evaporation in excess of 2 myand
winter temperatures down to -30'~. There is less than 50 mm of average annual precipitation.
Therefore all water is derived from river flows and the observed environmental changes have
been primarily driven by the reduction in these flows. Land management issues, such as tree
cutting and grazing, have exacerbated the situation brought about by the water shortage as the
area and lushness of the GC has reduced.

River flow records since 1957 show that flows in the 1990's at Qiala are only one third of
what they were in the 1950's and virtually all of this is used by the State Farms. Therefore
there is no flow currently downstream of Daxihaizi Reservoir. In fact the reduction in flows is
even greater, as significant areas of irrigation were already present in the tributaries prior to
1957. Cheng Qichou (1993) records in The Research on the Tarim River, that average annual
flow of the Tarim River (at Aler), prior to any irrigation development, was likely to have been
10.0 - 12.0 x 10' m3, i.e. about double the average over the last 50 years (4.60 x lo9 m3) and
more than double the average for the last decade (4.17 x 109 m3).

River modelling, using historical daily data, is required to determine the true situation of
natural flows and to determine changes induced by human water use (Working Paper 6).

The situation at Qiala is much worse. Relative to the 195OYs,the current flows are only 116th
of the original and relative to the pre-development flows are perhaps only 1/12. In fact of the
211 x lo6 m3 currently supplied to the LGC, about 150 x lo6 m3 is water purchased from the
Kongque River by the State Farms and diverted via the Kuta Main Canal.

Apart from two small releases in 1995, totalling 28 x lo6 m3, which were largely confined to
the river and didn't reach Yinsu, there have been no floods downstream of Daxihaizi
Reservoir since the mid 1980's.          Hence the remaining ecosystems have been relying on
progressively decreasing groundwater levels.




  The term "mineralisation" was not explained in the material provided to the TA. It has been assumed that it
represents Total Dissolved Solids, TSD, or something close thereto, despite the following reference citing it as
being the sum of the cations only: Xiangcan, Jin 1995 Lakes in China: Research oftheir Environment. Vol 1.

The reduction in river flows has been accompanied by increasing river salinity, particularly in
spring and early summer before the summer flood dilutes the saline irrigation drainage water
and groundwater.      Salinity levels peak at up to 6 g/l in spring at Aler due to return
groundwater and surface irrigation drainage. However, spring levels peak at only 2.8 g/l at
Qiala, apparently due to flow attenuation and dilution by Kongque River water.

There are insufficient data to conclusively quantify the changes over time, particularly as the
diversion of water from the Kongque River has included releases to the Tarim River at
unknown times since the mid 1970's and particularly since 1990. However, the data do
indicate that salinity levels appear to have increased since the 1960's.

The supply of water to the LGC is contingent on the total volume supplied to Aler and also the
transmission efficiency of the upper and middle Tarim River reaches.

As previously stated, all flows in the Tarim River are supplied by its tributaries; the Hotan,
YarkantKashgar Rivers and the Aksu River at its head, and the Kongque River at the
upstream end of the LGC. The Weigan River once contributed relatively small volumes (200
x lo6 m31yr)but no longer does so. As discussed below, average annual flows to the Tarim
River are now less than half those which are estimated to have prevailed prior to any irrigation
in the TB. Much of this reduction took place prior to the commencement of flow records in
1957.

The middle and upper reaches of the GC, ie. from Aler to Yinbazar and thence to Qiala, have
shrunk laterally and become drier in most locations. The exceptions are relatively small areas
now receiving more water than previously due to enlarged overflow locations made by
excavations. These diversions have been dug by local people, including herders, in response
to the reduced flooding frequency and resultant decrease in pasture extent and health.
However, because these diversions have no regulators they result in much higher water losses
at low and medium flows than previously. As discussed below, the increase in low flow
losses is almost certainly more than equalled by the reduced losses at high flows, due to the
decrease in flood size and frequency caused by irrigation use in the tributaries.

Figure 3 shows the reduction in annual flows by decade from the 1960's to the 1990's. Flows
reaching Aler have decreased by about 1 x 10' m3 over the period. Taking into account the
150 x lo6 m3 transferred from the Kongque River (included in the volumes presented in
Figure 3), there has been a similar annual reduction at Qiala. Therefore, although it appears as
if losses have increased between the two stations, because the proportion of flows at Qiala is
now less relative to Aler, this is only a proportional difference and is not a true change in the
relationship in annual flows between the two.

Hence the apparent increase in the volume lost in the upper and middle reaches, often cited by
some stakeholders as being due to increased floodplain losses, is in fact largely due to
irrigation use upstream of Aler. The upper and middle GCs are as much a victim of reduced
tributary flows to the Tarim River, as the LGC. Working Paper 3 provides a more detailed
temporal and spatial analysis of the flow relationships between the stations along the TR.

The pattern of losses within years could not be analysed using the available monthly data.
Daily data exists for Aler, Xinqiman and Qiala from 1957, but was not provided to the project
team because of "confidentiality", "intellectual property" and the size of the requested
payment of RMB 1.6 x lo6 yuan (for Aler and Xinqiman data only). Daily flow data is
required to determine the changes in low, medium and high flow losses, as individual events
would need to be "tracked" downstream to resolve the loss component. However, given that
some excavated floodouts (distributary channels) have inverts lower than the river bed, it is
reasonable to conclude that losses at low flows are now greater than previously. However,
these are unlikely to equal the reduction in high flow losses due to reduced flood size caused
by upstream water use.

In fact it is this reduction in high flow losses that has in part hidden the total increase in
consumptive water use of 2.2 x 10' m3 upstream of Qiala. In addition to the 1 x 10' m3
increase upstream of Aler, discussed above, most of the Aler to Qiala allocation of 1.25 x 10'
m3 between has developed since the 1960's. If were not for a reduction in overall annual
losses, annual flows at Qiala would be negative, even with the average annual transfer of 150
x 1 o6m3from   the Kongque River to Qiala.

2.4 WHAT IS 'I'HE MANAGEMENT SITIIATION'?
Translation of the awareness and concern about the environmental deterioration into effective
action is being both hampered and facilitated. It is facilitated by some good research and
monitoring of critical parameters, although, as always, there are gaps and more would be most
beneficial.   It is also facilitated by the progress towards water use quotas, controlling
unauthorised access to water and implementing measures to manage grazing pressure, medical
herb collection, firewood collection and tree cutting.

However, it is hampered by the lack of agreed environmental outcomes. Outcomes against
which changes to the prevailing extent and condition of the green corridor can be measured. It
is further hampered by the lack of an agreed set of overall conceptual models within which
appropriate sets of corrective action can be devised and through which such actions must then
be implemented.

At least three inter-related conceptual models are needed.         The first of these involves
understanding the key processes that drive the' fluvial geomorphology and riverine
ecosystems. A second, involves understanding the socio-economic and technical functional
relationships that link the human, agricultural cropping, livestock and water use systems that
have been, are currently and could be practiced in various reaches of the GC or parts thereof
and how these actions in each reach or part thereof impact on each other. A third, involves
understanding how the incentives and disincentives created by the prevailing administrative
and policy environments impact on the actions of those who live in or are otherwise
dependent on the GC and/or use the land and/or water resources that have determined the
prevailing and will determine the future extent and condition of the GC.

Attempts to derive agreed positions on all of these points plus the inter-relationships that exist
between them demands a concerted collaborative effort that involves a number of disciplines,
administrations and decision making entities. A range of prefectures, institutes, bureaus and
agencies are involved and each of these entities have differing perspectives with regard to
what constitutes desirable sets of environmental outcomes. They also differ with regard to
their understanding of the conceptual models involved and how they should be used to
achieve a particular result with regard to a particular part of the GC. As a result, the level of
collaboration needed to save or restore the LGC is high and will be difficult to realise.

Achieving the levels of collaboration required is currently being severely hampered by several
factors, not the least of which is the restricted sharing of data between agencies. This
restricted sharing of data is occurring for several reasons.          These include differing
perspectives, "confidentiality" and/or the high price put on data (e.g one agency was quoted a
fee of RMB 1.6 x106 Yuan to access 40 years of historical river flow data at 2 or 3 gauging.
In addition, the LGC system is currently being treated as a "black box" from which "products"
are extracted, such as crops, livestock, timber, firewood, desert barrier, etc. There are few
cases of an explicit understanding of the processes that determine whether the GC lives or dies
being worked into management decisions and even less when these management decisions
impact on several prefectures, institutions, bureaus and other agencies.

As a result, such understandings as do exist suffer from a lack of data that has been
specifically collected to address particular issues andlor quantify processes in terms that are
relevant to available management actions. But at present there are few measurable goals for
sustaining the ecosystems of the LGC for their own sake, i.e. for their intrinsic value without
an explicit human use.

If the intrinsic values of the GC, or parts thereof are sustained, then the human uses of all or
parts of the GC are also likely to be sustained. Such sustainable management is achieved by

identifying the limits of natural resource use for each level of environmental condition that
could be managed towards. Each management option is then assessed against the resource
limits and agreed environmental goals, through the analysis of the three conceptual models
described above.



3. WHAT METHOD WAS USED TO VALUE THE LOWER GREEN
CORRIDOR?
The major outcome of this study was to determine the ecological and socio-economic value of
the LGC. This value was required to help people and agencies with an interest in the LGC
(the stakeholders) answer the question "Why save the Lower Green Corridor?".

A combined approach was used in which the opportunity cost of water was derived for each of
the major reaches of the Tarim River, the upstream tributaries and the Kaidu-Kongque River,
based on past commercial use for cropping and grazing livestock. These opportunity costs
were then used to value the volumes of water that are required to be forgone in those locations
to supply the necessary volumes for a range of scenarios to save the LGC. The scenarios and
the values so derived are "contingent" on current uses and on the adoption of that level of
action being agreed and_ implemented.        At present the LGC has effectively zero socio-
economic value downstream of Daxiahizi Reservoir, as no water is being released and all
families are being moved out.

Using a contingent valuation approach, the LGC has no single value. Every stakeholder has a
different set of values with regard to the GC and the extent and condition to which it or parts
of it should be saved. These sets of values are often influenced by commercial considerations.
These commercial considerations are often dependent on the extent to which each stakeholder
has a financial involvement that is directly dependent on what happens to all o r parts of the
GC including the LGC. Hence the answer to the question "What is the value of the LGC ?" is
contingent on the collective opinion of all stakeholders.

In addition, decisions made in response to what is assessed to be happening to the LGC and
what action can be taken within the available resources is then determined by the weighted
opinions of those involved in the decision making processes.

Such decisions will invariably mean some stakeholders have to give up the possibility of using
some resources in order to use them to save or restore the LGC. That use may be a future use.
It may be an existing use. What actually happens will be the result of how those responsible
for implementing these decisions (who are also stakeholders) respond. In some instances
some stakeholder may quite validly claim to be in a position of not wanting to give up a
commercial benefit, but still claim to have a non-commercial interest in saving or restoring all
or part of the GC. The question then becomes one of how much, if any, resource some are
prepared to give up to save or restore some and which parts of any or all of the GC.

In effect, the only measure of the value of the GC that can be derived with any certainty are
the values implied by past actions and the decisions that might be taken now between
alternative future but realistic alternative courses of action. Under these circumstances the
value of the GC or parts thereof will be determined by the options that are actually
implemented in the future.

Finally, even this analysis will vary since the options that can be regarded as realistically
applicable in the future will change over time and themselves be determined by the actions of
the past. As a result a series of intermediate questions have to be asked. First to "precipitate"

a value based on the actions of the past and, second, to determine the range of options that can
be regarded as realistic course of action at each point in time in the future.

The questions that need to be asked take the form of "If we are prepared to use this amount of
water to achieve this much restoration, what is the value of the foregone benefits?". This
question was "asked" by modelling the opportunity costs of foregoing water use in upstream
reaches to supply economic and ecological benefits in the LGC. This was done for four
scenarios the first being an average annual volume approximating those of the 1950's, i.e.
1,004x106 m3per year. The other three represent various estimates of the volumes that might
be sufficient to save basic featui-esand functions of the LGC, or at least parts of it, and that
might be realistically made available through TB 11. They are 120 x106 m3/ year, 150 x106
m31yearand 300 x106m31year,the first being the lowest estimate advised (TMB) and the last,
the amount provided for in the TR water allocations after implementation of TB 11. Even if
they are inadequate to restore the whole LGC, they might be sufficient to maintain the area
from Daxihaizi Reservoir to Yinsu and achieve partial restoration to Alegan (after an initial
wetting up period to re-establish groundwater levels).

The socio-economic opportunity costs calculated below, only include the commercial value of
the LGC. Figure 4 shows that the LGC and its ecosystems support both commercial and non-
commercial values. The commercial and non-commercial values are inextricably linked and
to varying degrees in ways that will also vary in each reach of the TRB. It is important to note
that both the commercial and non-commercial values are supported by the physical,
hydrological and ecological resource base.

4. WHAT 1sTHE VALUE OF THE LOWER GREEN CORRIDOR?

4.1 SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUES

4.1.1 BEI'U'EE~-REACHTRADE-OF\+
The value of the benefits currently earned from commercial socio-economic activities in any
reach of the GC less any costs that are currently saved or deferred provide an indication of the
value that past stakeholders placed on that reach of the GC today. This is a simple point in
time benefit-cost analysis. The results are presented in Table I . They do not include the costs
to upstream areas associated with any prior reductions in the extent and condition of the GC in
the upper and middle reaches that occurred as a result of reduced grazing and wood
production. Further reductions of this nature are inevitable if the pre 1950s flood frequencies
that have already occurred due to large scale water use in the tributaries are further reduced by
the TB I1works.

Therefore, whilst the eight regulators proposed in TB I1 will help reduce the overly wet areas
and therefore be beneficial in ecological terms and water saved, they are unlikely to achieve
inundation of the broader areas of the upper and middle GCs that have become drier due to the
reduced flood fiequency. This drying will be worsened by the construction of levees, which,
even if flood frequencies had not been reduced, would cause a lower frequency of floodplain
inundation than that which occurred naturally.

The actual relationship between flood extent and river heightlflood volume, needs to be
ascertained for different management regimes after implementation of TB 11, if it has not
already been done. No information could be supplied to the TA regarding these relationships,
which is critical if the assumption that the proposed regulators and levees will have no adverse
impact on the upper and middle GCs is to be objectively confirmed.

4.1.2 C'LIRRENTSOCIO-ECONORIIC        VAL,~'E
There will be a net gain to the economy if the Daxihaizi - Taitema reach of the GC is allowed
to die and a net loss to the economy if either of the Aler - Yinbazar, or Yinbazar - Qiala
reaches of the GC are allowed to die. In other words, the absolute gain to the economy rises
when water is allowed to flow down to but not beyond Daxihaizi. Water that goes past
Daxihaizi can be more profitably used elsewhere.         Allowing it to go past Daxihaizi is
currently costing the Chinese economy about RMB 325 Yuanka of LGC /year in foregone
commercial benefits. This is a foregone opportunity cost. It is also saving (or deferring) a one
off cost of about RMB 170 Yuanlha of LGC that will be incurred if and when the households
currently dependent of the LGC need to be resettled. This is a foregone opportunity benefit.
Accordingly, if all water currently flowing past Daxihaizi could be cut off and all the
resettlement were to be carried out in one year the value stakeholders' past decisions are
currently placing on each hectare of LGC would be about RMB 155 Yuanlha of LGC.

However, this is a purely hypothetical case to derive a current value for the GC. The
timeframe over which the alternative currently foregone commercial socio-economic activities
can be brought into production, the current earnings generated from the LGC fall to zero, and
any household resettlement costs are incurred can not be predicted. As a result this analysis
does not extend to the calculation of Net Present Values and the opportunity costs used in this
discussion are those that include the resettlement costs.

Uses of the GC in the other reaches have strong positive values of RMB 3,820 Yuan per
hectare of GC sustained in the Qiala - Taitema reach and of RMB 1,042 Yuan per hectare of
GC sustained in the Yinbazar - Taitema reach. Averaged over the entire TR GC, from Aler to

Taitema, they drop to RMB 460 Yuan per hectare. These results are a direct reflection of the
assumption that the areas of GC sustained in each reach have been estimated by dividing the
quantity of unaccounted for water in each reach by 4,500 m3/ha (see Table 6, Notes Method
2). Ideally, they should have been estimated from current satellite imagery with the condition
of the GC in selected locations being ground truthed to provide some objective information as
to its current status. This could then have been compared to the quantity of water that has
produced this situation.

Unfortunately the data on which all this analysis is made are out of date, crude and
 incomplete, reducing the credibility of the absolute figures derived, but it is all the information
that could be made available. As a result about all that can be concluded is that the available
 information is inadequate for planning purposes and that the case for sustaining the LGC,
 down stream of Daxihaizi, is very weak in socio-economic terms. Conversely, a relatively
 strong case appears to exist for sustaining the GC in higher reaches of the TR GC.

The values of non-commercial socio-economic benefits can not be derived in monetary terms
with any reliability. Social values relating primarily to standard of living criteria, reflected by
income per capita, are included in the commercial value.         Non-commercial or monetary
components of "quality of life" values, such as health and environmental aspects such as
access to water, air quality, exposure to dust, or simply being able to sit under a tree or catch a
fish, are more difficult to quantify. These non-commercial components also includes the
intrinsic value of the ecosystem and general environment. Not only do these natural systems
support the commercial values to a greater or lesser degree, they have value in their own right.
Intrinsic values are real and valid but they are a matter of personal, organisational and/or
governmental opinion. They can be assessed but only indirectly. These indirect assessments
generally involve examining the opportunity cost of the actual courses of action taken.

Under most courses of action to restore the LGC, there will also be changes in the extent and
condition of the GC in more upstream reaches of the Tarim River. When this occurs, the
extent and/or condition of the GC in one reach of the Tarim River are being substituted for
those in another. In such cases, decisions will have to be taken as to how these substitutions
should be weighted. A one for one weighting would mean each hectare of GC is given the
same value regardless of where it is located. As with intrinsic values this weighting would be
partially a matter of opinion, but would also be dependent on the assessment of the uniqueness
of the LGC ecosystems.


To explore the cost and consequences of proceeding with an attempt to save the LGC an
analysis was made of four scenarios (Table 2). These values can also be seen as the potential
value of the LGC if and when a particular scenario is implemented. In each scenario, the
water delivered to Daxihaizi would be for the exclusive benefit of the Daxihaizi to Taitema
reach of the LGC. Except for Scenario D, the existing volumes used by the State Farms
would remain for their use and are additional to these volumes. The 1,004 x 106m3figure is
about the average annual volume of water received by the LGC in the 1950s. The other
volumes are those quoted at the LGC Workshop (Working Paper 8) as being a range of
volumes that might be made available to "save" the LGC. The potential sources of water
listed in Table 2 are discussed in Section 5.3.2.

Table 3 summarises the results derived and discussed in Working Paper 7. A discount rate of
12% is probably the most appropriate rate and is relatively conservative given the high growth
rate of the Chinese economy. All NPV's are negative (shown by brackets) and represent a cost
to the Chinese economy. Thus the best option from a socio-economic perspective is shown by
the largest (but smallest negative number (ie. -2.41 is a higher NPV (and therefore preferable)
to - 3.67) . The Table also shows the change in area of Green Corridor in the various reaches
that results from the various options.

* The Daxihaizi to Qiala reach is assumed to be area neutral in this analysis as losses from the State
Farms irrigation and storages are maintaining groundwater levels to a large extent. Hence there will
be relatively little transmission loss (0.2 is assumed) in this reach during the supply of the above
volumes to Daxihaizi. Those volumes will assist maintain the existing vegetation in a more healthy
state.

Interpretation The results suggest there can only be an overall saving of GC in Option 1 of
all Scenarios. In these Option 1's the water required is sourced entirely from the Kongque
River. All other options lose more GC in higher reaches of the TR than can be restored in the
LGC.

No option in an) scenario has a positive NPV at any discount rate. In effect all options in all
scenarios are going to impose a cost on the Chinese economy if a decision is taken to
implement any one of them. Moreover, that cost is significant, in two ways. First, there will
be lost socio-economic opportunities. It will cost the Chinese economy to save or partially
restore the LGC and these funds could be better used to benefit the Chinese economy if they
were used in other ways. Secondly, unless the water required is sourced from the Kongque
River, attempting to save or partially restore even some of the LGC more GC will be lost in
higher reaches than can be saved or restored in the LGC.


Table 3 shows that the total cost of individual Options in any Scenario ranges from Yuan 210
million (Scenario D Option 2)_upto Yuan 4,240 million (Scenario A Option 3). If a decision
is taken now to implement any one of these options the cost of that option will indicate the
value that the decision-makers have placed on the LGC when that decision is taken. Relative
to the results derived in Table 1, the cost of all individual future options (Table 3) exceed the
value past decisions have placed on the LGC of about Yuan 180 million (see Table 1 Qiala,
Net Benefit (+) /Cost of Yuan 179,788). This means that a decision to implement any one of
the options to save the LGC, or parts thereof, examined in Table 3 will be placing a
significantly higher value on the LGC than has been placed on it in the past.

On a per lo3 hectares of LGC saved or restored under the Option 1's of all Scenarios over all
discount rates, the value that would have to be placed on the LGC ranges from Yuan 6.28
million (Scenario A, Option 1 at 15% discount rate) to Yuan 14..5 million (Scenario C,
Option 1 at 9% discount rate) and for Options 2, 3 or 4 in Scenarios A through D it sits
between Yuan 7.78 million (Scenario D, Option 2 at a discount rate of 15%) to Yuan 19.01
million (Scenario A, Option 3 at a discount rate of 9%).

The analysis presented in Table 3 also indicates that options that source some water from
higher reaches of the TR result in a net loss of GC. This means a stakeholder choice that

implements any one of these options is placing a higher value on a hectare of the LGC than is
being placed on a hectare of GC in higher reaches. The substitution ratios that appear range
from 1.33 to 2.21 for Scenario A Options 2, 3 and 4. This means that for every hectare of
LGC saved between 1.33 to 2.21 will be lost in higher reaches ofthe GC. For Scenarios B, C
and D the ratios range from 1.32 to 2.24. However, these outcomes are a direct reflection of
the number of cubic metres of water that have to pass Aler in order to have one cubic metre of
water pass Qiala (the transrnissivity) assumptions used and the need to supply 4,500 m3 of
water to sustain a hectare of GC and can be deduced if not specifically quantified without this
analysis.

The cash flows generated for each option within each Scenario incur different magnitudes of
costs and generate different magnitudes of benefits over more than a decade. However, these
variations in the timing of outlays, losses of currently generated benefits or the generation of
future benefits do not change the ranking of the Options by NPV within Scenarios when they
are discounted using discount rates that range from 9 to 15 percent.

The analyses presented in Tables 1 and 3 were structured around the availability of data. That
data is crude, out of date and incomplete. In addition, the analyses have been primarily
conducted to derive a value for the LGC, not generate information that can be used to choose
a future course of action. Even so the results obtained suggest that from a socio-economic
perspective there is little point in attempting to save or restore LGC below Daxihai and it
would be better to concentrate on sustaining but not expanding the State Farm activities
between Qiala and Daxihai and saving GC upstream of Qiala.

The results suggest there can only be an overall saving of GC in Option 1 of all Scenarios. In
these Option 1s the water required is sourced entirely from the Kongque River. All other
options lose more GC in higher reaches of the TR than can be restored in the LGC. The total
cost of all Options ranges from Yuan 210 million up to Yuan 4,320 million. On a per lo3
hectares of LGC saved or restored under the Option 1's of all Scenarios over all discount rates
it ranges from Yuan 6.28 million to 10.8 million per 10' hectares and for Options 2, 3 or 4 in
Scenarios A through D it sits between Yuan 7.87 million to 19.01 million per 10' hectares.

Options that source some water from higher reaches of the TR result in a net loss of GC. A
stakeholder choice that implements any one of these Options implies that a higher value is
being placed on GC in the LGC than is being placed on the value of GC in higher reaches.
The substitution ratios that appear range from 1.33to 2.21 for Scenario A Options 2, 3 and 4.
This means that for every hectare of LGC GC saved between 1.33 to 2.21 will be lost in
higher reaches of the GC. For Scenarios B, C and D the ratios range from 1.32 to 2.24.
However, these outcomes are a direct reflection of the transmissivity assumptions used and
the need to supply 4,500 103m3of water to sustain a hectare of GC and can be deduced if not
specifically quantified without having to go through all this analysis.

The cash flows generated for each option within each Scenario incur different magnitudes of
costs and generate different magnitudes of benefits over more than a decade. However, these
variations in the timing of outlays, losses of currently generated benefits or the generation of
future benefits do not change the ranking of the Options by NPV within Scenarios when they
are discounted using discount rates that range from 9 to 15 percent.

4.2 ECIOLOGICAL VALUES

4.2.1 C;ENERAI,    VAI,~JES

Any ecological value placed on the LGC by stakeholders is included in the socio-economic
values already derived. This is because any ecological values foregone are the direct result of
stakeholder's past (Current Socio-economic value) or future (Potential Socio-Economic value)
decisions. However, the socio-economic values so derived do little to indicate the nature,
function or worth of the ecological values per se that have been foregone. To do this other
parameters need to be compared and quantified. Such parameters include the total area of the
GC in the upper (Aler to Yinbazar), middle (Yinbazar to Qiala) and lower (Qiala to Taitema)
reaches (the last being the LGC), the area of poplar diversifolia trees (Populus diversfolia,
Schenk), grass and wetlands, the location of rare species and habitats and the use of each area
by migratory species.

The analysis was restricted by the nature of the ecological and biological data available. Most
data about species related to either the whole TB or the GC as a whole. There are few
quantified ecological data specific to the LGC, hence few quantitative comparisons could be
made. Other comparisons were based on interpretations of habitat types and conditions, in
relation to likely habitat preferences.

The total area of each type of habitat is presented in Figure 2. Relative to the total area of
Green Corridor habitat, the LGC accounts for 20 %, including 23 % of the total area of poplar
diversifolia, i.e. originally it accounted for a about one 115 to 114 of the total habitat and forest
area. However, most of the poplar diversifolia in the LGC was "sparse", at the time of
mapping. It is not known whether this would have been the case prior to large scale irrigation
use upstream, as the date of the base imagery is not known.

It was concluded that the LGC's ecosystems, habitat and species were not unique, either prior
to degradation or now. This conclusion is based on the information provided to the TA
(Working Paper 2) and observations made during field trips to the upper, middle and lower
GC. This information indicated that the physical and vegetative habitat and the species
occupying each of the three major reaches were essentially the same and that the diversity
within each reach, equalled or exceeded that between the reaches.

The most distinguishing features of the LGC are the higher silt and clay content of the
floodplain soils, the ephemeral swamps and salt marshes extending into the Taklimakan
Desert between Qiala and Daxihaizi and the inflow of lower salinity surface and groundwater
from the Kongque River. These differences have not produced a discernible difference in
species composition that has been noted by studies to date, at least to the extent where they are
obvious and therefore noticed.

If the LGC environment and/or ecosystems are not unique, then why the concern regarding its
demise? This can be answered by listing the functions that have been ascribed to the LGC by
various stakeholders (Table 4). They have commercial and non-commercial aspects, but it is
the former together with the social values that have generally been considered most highly
with less emphasis on the actual ecology for its own (intrinsic) sake.

Table 4:     List of functions (practical valaes) of the LGC by st~keholders

           FunctionNalue                                       Comment

1.  Provide grazing for stock owned      There is now little grazing downstream of Daxihaizi due
    by herdsmen and State Farms          to lack of water.

2. A green oasis for people living       The efforts of current and past generations of State Farm
    in the State Farm areas              people has been tremendous and their commitment to
                                         remaining in the area and defending what they have built
                                         up is second to none.

3. Protect inhabited areas,              The amount and frequency of river and floodplain flows is
    including irrigation areas in the    obviously essential to maintainingthe LGC.

                                         Specific mechanisms need to be more fully understood.
    deserts
                                         Groundwater is obviously important in maintaining
                                         vegetation on and between semi-mobile dunes adjacent to
                                         the GC, i.e. the greatest stabilising effect of vegetation is
                                         in the dune areas, not in the GC itself. Scouring flood
                                          flows are the most important mechanism for removing
                                          aeolian sand within the GC.

4. Protect inhabited areas upstream       A scientifically proven link between the LGC and
     of the LGC, including Korla

   City and settlements and         protection of these areas has yet to be demonstrated..
   irrigation in the middle and
                                    The width of the LGC is only about 3 km at Qiala and
   upper reaches
                                    therefore it is unlikely to protect upstream areas by itself,
                                    but is much broader taking into account Aksupu Swamp
                                    between the Kongque and Tarim Rivers. Protection is via
                                    the mechanisms cited in the comments for the preceding
                                    function. Hence, Aksupu Swamp, which is fed by both
                                    the Kongque & Tarim Rivers, is a critical feature.
                                    However, management proposals to date have not
                                    considered protection of the source and frequency of its
                                    joint water supply, nor the swamp's role in halting desert
                                    expansion.

                                    If the irrigated State Farm areas were to be abandoned,
                                    there may be additional impacts caused by polluted dust
                                    containing pesticide residues used on the farm land.

5. Maintain the transport and       The highway and telephone line are the only two
   communication corridor in the    infrastructure. They are little used beyond State Farm 35
   LGC                              because there are now few people there. The technology
                                    is well developed to stabilise sand dunes using cut reeds,
                                    as is already done along the highway and the Desert
                                    Highway. The deciding factor will be the cost efficiency
                                    of such methods verses the cost efficiency of using water.

6. Reduce the occurrence of dust    No data or conceptual models exist to objectively
   storms and "disastrous" weather  determine the likelihood of the LGC significantly
                                    contributing to the source of dust and sand if it degrades
                                    further.   As there are much greater adjacent areas of
                                    unvegetated desert and degraded rangeland adjacent to
                                                         -

                                    Korla, the issue needs a holistic analysis and explicit
                                    consideration of sources relative to areas affected, the role
                                    of the GC in removing dust and sand, which particle sizes
                                    cause specific problems, etc.

                                    Consideration also needs to be given as to whether the
                                    dominant sand dune moving winds are necessarily the
                                    same as those that create the dust storms and disastrous
                                    weather, i.e. they are not necessarily from the SE and
                                    often the storms are from the desert towards the GC.

7. To meet the stated policies of   Action needs to be taken on these policies by developing
   the National Peoples' Congress   measurable and achievable goals, based on demonstrable
   to "save the LGC"                processes and values, and agreed to by all stakeholders.
                                    At present the desired outcomes are not sufficiently clear
                                    to be managed towards and monitored.

9. Maintain the area of Populus     There is comparatively more of this species and riverine
   diversifolia (PD)                 forest habitat, which has a wide range in the TB, than
                                     other more restricted habitats, such as wetlands and
                                     floodplain lakes. Overall habitat protection priorities need
                                    to be assessed. The issue with regard to PD is more of
                                     habitat quality as most areas throughout the GC are

                                        suffering. reductions   in  flooding frequency and/or
                                        duration.

10. Provision of habitat for            Whilst the LGC is not unique, it did and does have
    important and/or rare species       important habitat for rare species, as does the GC
                                        upstream. It also contributed about '/4 of the total area of
                                        GC prior to degradation.     Therefore is it important to
                                        maintain and restore as much as is possible, without
                                        compromising the maintenance of the GC in upstream
                                        reaches, where such targets may be more easily met and
                                        may more easily serve both commercial and non-
                                        commercial values.

11. Provision of a link between wet     Many species using riverine habitats are highly mobile or
    habitats in northern and southern   migratory, particularly in arid environments where
    Xinjiang and Tibet, and places      droughts can decimate populations and recolonisation and
    further north and south             migration are important mechanisms for species survival.
                                        Such species include fish and waterbirds, the latter
                                        including species that are included in the China Australia
                                        Migratory Bird Agreement (CAMBA) and the Ramsar
                                        Agreement on Internationally Significant Wetlands.
                                        Between the eastern side of the Gobi Desert to the Hotan
                                        River in the west, the TR provided the only link between
                                        the south of China and the north; that link is now broken.

12. Maintenance of the lake and         The dry condition of this lake over the past 20 years is due
    wetland habitat of Taitema Lake     to lack of flows from both the Tarim and Qarqan Rivers.
                                        The relative contributions need to be established, as the
                                        Qarqan River being shorter and having double the slope
                                        could, in principle, supply water far more effectively than.
                                        the TR. It could be an important 1o.w altitude habitat for
                                        migrating waterbirds in early springllate autumn.



The functions listed in Table 4 need to be explicitly considered in any future management
decision to rehabilitate the LGC. The extent to which these functions need to be rehabilitated
will be the goals against which the success of management actions can be tested.


5. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SAVE THE LOWER GREEN
CORRIDOR?

5.1 WATER ALLOCATIONS

The Tarim Basin Water Resources Commission (TBWRC) has recently determined irrigation
allocations, which are designed to achieve the average annual flows in the river recorded in
Table 3. These are normally referred to as "allocations", but there is no formal mechanism to
ensure that these flow volumes are met in any one year. In actual fact, the river "allocations"
are targets that are generally reviewed after each year. Only in years where the inflows are
very obviously less than normal, is the TBWRC's Executive Committee convened to
determine the amount by which irrigation quotas should be reduced to meet the river
allocations. The lack of real-time data dissemination on river flows between agencies and
Prefectures, appears to be a significant impediment to the early identification of flow
shortages. In above average years, the Tarim River should receive "bonus" flows as the rules

stipulate that additional irrigation should not be undertaken in these years. There is some
anecdotal evidence that extra water use does occur, but to what extent is not known.

The water allocations nominally require 0.3 x 10' m3 to be provided to the LGC, downstream
of Daxihaizi Reservoir. All estimates supplied to the TA regarding the amount of water
required to "save" the LGC are equal to or less than this amount.


5.2 WHAT AMOUNT OF THE LOWER GREEN CORRIDOR CAN BE SAVED?
5.2.1 P ~ ~ \ * r oEsl'rnl,i~~s
                      u s
It stands to reason that if the objective is to "save" the LGC in all its original extent and
diversity, then almost all upstream water use would need to cease to restore the original river
flows. There is no "free lunch" and only limited water use efficiencies can be imposed on
natural systems before they are not natural systems with a high degree of diversity, but are
managed plantations and irrigated grasslands.                 Complete restoration clearly can not be
achieved as it is not possible to reduce human water use by the amounts required.

This fact needs to be explicitly recognised by all stakeholders. Consequently, all estimates
that have been made to date, being much less than the natural average volumes, can only ever
achieve partial restoration, in terms of extent andlor quality.

Various estimates of the amount of water required to "save" the LGC were supplied to the
TA. Three estimates provided at the LGC Workshop and mentioned during various other
interviews, were 120, 150 and 300 million m3. The later figure is supported by being the

nominated allocation in the recently agreed water allocation agreement between the
~refectul-es7.Apparently the smaller figure of 120 x lo6 m3 is the most recent estimate (no
source or basis supplied) and the 300 x lo6 m3the older estimate.

It is useful to compare these volumes to the likely original average flow past Qiala, although
an accurate figure is far from possible, due to lack of data. The analysis in Working Paper 5
 indicates that up to 1.9 x lo9 m3 may have been the natural average annual flow to maintain
the LGC ecosystems.

 5.2.2 REVIE\\'OF EXISTISGESTlhZATES
 One source of empirical information suggests that each hectare of GC on average requires
 about 4,500 m3 per annum to stay in a viable condition8; grasslands might require less and
 poplar diversifolia more (about 4,800 to 6,000 m3/ha for bare survival and 9,750 m3/ha for
 good timber, Xu De Yan pers com). These volumes are average annual amounts, they do not
 have to be applied every year. In fact, the ecosystem has evolved on the basis of periodic
 floods interspersed with varying numbers of smaller annual flows. It is a situation in which
 the return periods of larger floods are as critical to ecosystem extent and condition, as are the
 intervening smaller flows.         Hence, there is a need to analyse flood frequency and flow
 percentiles in addition to annual average flows (see Working Paper 3).

 Method 2 in Table 6 compares the area that could be restored to a relatively natural condition,
 using the above average unit area requirement, to other empirically derived unit area
 estimates. Larger areas would of course be partially restored by the downstream movement of
 groundwater from these watered areas.

                      minimum for PD survival.

          Method 2: The figure of 4,500 m3/ha/yr was derived by dividing the estimate of the natural
                      average flow at Aler by the total area of GC downstream of Aler, measured
                      from the "Mapof the Landscapeof the Tarim River Drainage Area" 1995.

         Method 3a: This average use figure is based on the area of LGC forest (200,000 ha) &
                      grassland (280,000 ha) with average use rates of 3000 m3/yr and 800 m3/yr
                      respectively (grassland is assumed to only need inundation every 5 years) plus
                      200 mm/mth evaporation x 1 mth, as per the Groundwater Specialist's
                      assumptions in Working Paper 5.

         Method 3b: Same as 3a, but assuming grassland inundation every 2 years on average.

                      being required for good tree health for timber.

          Note:       All methods also require an initial groundwater recharge volume to raise
                      groundwater levels to within 6 m of the surface. This would be about 1.5 x109
                      m3for the whole of the original LGC area (and proportionally less for each of
                      the above scenarios, depending on the percentage of area restorable.



Scenario B has been highlighted because of its endorsement in the water allocation agreement
discussed above. It is also the largest volume that is likely to be made available within the
current socio-economic and political framework, as indicated by the successive reductions in
estimates since that volume was first proposed.

If an annual average allocation of 300 x lo9 m3 is supplied, the area that can be restored,
assuming 4,500 m3/halyr, is 66,667 ha, or 14% of the original area of the LGC downstream of
Qiala. Using the other empirical estimates of unit area water requirements gives restorable
areas ranging from 6% to 24% of the LGC area below Qiala, however, as Method 4 is based
on timber quality tree production levels, the lowest area that is likely to be restored is 62,500
ha, or 13%of the original area.

To these areas must be added the area between Qiala and Daxihaizi that is already being
maintained by irrigations flows to some extent, albeit in a somewhat degraded condition.
Hence the actual proportion of the LGC that is restorable is greater than the percentages
shown in Table 6, but can not be calculated at present as the areas of the LGC "upstream
Daxihaizi" verses "downstream Daxihaizi" were not available.

In addition to the on-going average annual requirements, an initial "wetting up" period will be
required to recharge the depleted groundwater aquifers (see Working Paper 5). Consequently,
Method 2 for instance would also require an initial groundwater recharge volume of about 2.1
x108m3to raise groundwater levels to within 6 m of the surface, i.e. 14%of 1.5 x109m3.

It is not possible to accurately predict the distribution or geographic extent of this restoration
with current data. Most benefits would be realised upstream of Yinsu, with progressively
fewer functions being restored between there and Alegan. In all cases, except Scenario A
which replicates 1950's conditions, only limited restoration would be achieved downstream of
Alegan and there would be little benefit at Taitema Lake. Assuming Method 2, Scenario A

would restore about half or more of the LGC area (taking into account the existing partially
maintained area upstream of Daxihaizi).

It is possible to increase and manage which areas of the LGC receive benefit from these
volumes through the construction of works in the Tarim River channel, flood runners and on
the floodplain. These works would be strategically located and designed to spread and/or
retain the water without having to achieve high discharge rates. The extent to which this is
possible and desirable, needs to be determined in the next phase of decision making. It is
important to recognise, however, that there remains "no free lunch" and that such measures
are limited in their ability to reduce the unit volume of water required per unit area. This is
because of hndamental physical laws governing the inseparable flow of water and salt.
Salinisation of land is a major limiting factor in reducing unit area water volumes. A flushing
component is required to prevent near surface salt accumulation and shallow lateral
translocation of salt that impacts on adjacent areas.

There is also a trade-off. Such structures will slow the passage of water down the LGC. This
can occur to the extent that water use efficiencies actually decrease. There are secondary
problems. These include salt accumulation, impediments to fish passage and homogenisation
of the natural variety and consequently, biodiversity of the LGC. That is, unless carehlly
balanced these trade-offs can begin to defeat the original purpose of the works, at least with
respect to some of the hnctions documented in Table 4.             There is also an increasing
construction, operation and maintenance cost the more extensive and complex such structures
become.



5.3 WHERE CAN 'THE WATER BE SUPPI,IED FROM?
5.3.1 KCVIE\\/OF PRIORITIES REI+ARII.ITATIONEFFICIENCIES
                                 AND

Assuming that the current water allocations are endorsed and strengthened through additional
management measures, begs the question "From whei-e can these volumes of water be
supplied and at what cost?" The cost with respect to the socio-economic values, has been
answered above. It remains to ask, "what is the best thing to do ecologically"?

Prior to assuming that action is required in the LGC, it is pertinent to look at the GC as whole,
to check that the proposed use of resources to save the LGC are indeed best utilised there.

The conclusion noted in Section 5.1, that the LGC's habitat and ecosystems are largely non-
unique, means that substitution is possible in principle, i.e. it is possible to rehabilitate GC
habitat upstream of Qiala, in the upper and middle reaches of the Tarim River, in preference to
rehabilitating LGC habitat, which because of transmission losses, can be considered to be a
more "expensive" user of water. However, it must be remembered that most of these "losses"
are in fact benefiting ecosystems in the upper and middle GCs as the flows pass through. Not
even the "non-beneficial evaporation" (NBE) can be considered a true loss because of the
following factors.

Firstly, surface flooding is almost certainly the major groundwater recharge mechanism and
the longer the duration, the greater the recharge, hence ponded areas provide a long duration.
It is clear from the continuing presence of shallow groundwaters in the vicinity of Aksupu
Swamp and between Qiala and Daxihaizi, that groundwater moves long distances laterally
once recharged, benefiting the vegetated areas of the GC, including the LGC. Secondly,
evaporation from ponded areas is a non-reducible consequence of open water bodies, and such
water bodies are an absolute necessity for many species. The identification of the entire

volume of non-draining swamps or other depressions, as "losses" is to disregard the
importance of these areas to fish, waterbirds, flora and other wildlife.


The commercial cost analysis in Section 4.1.3 provides estimates of the opportunity cost of
supplying different average annual volumes to the LGC from a number of potential sources.
The option discussed in detail was the supply of 300 x lo6 m3 as defined in the recent TR
Water Allocation Agreement.

As discussed in Section 4.1.3 (Table 2), more water could be supplied to the LGC by:

1.  Increasing the amount of water diverted from the Kongque River via Kuta Main Canal;

2. Reducing the amount of water used in upstream of Aler in the TRYstributaries;

3. Reducing the amount of water used in the Aler to Yinbazar reach of the Tarim River;

4. Reducing the amount of water used in the Yinbazar to Qiala reach of the Tarim River;
    andlor,

5. Reducing the amount of water used in the Qiala to Daxihaizi reach of the Tarim River;

The first four options require that less water be used upstream of the LGC. The fifth requires
that more water be made available for the environment from sources within the LGC. The
first option requires that this water use saving be achieved to a large extent upstream of
Bosten Lake in the Kaidu River system, as otherwise salinity levels will rise to unacceptable
levels for users downstream of the lake, particularly for human consumption, including Korla
city. Presently, the lower salinity water from the Kaidu - Kongque system is used to mix with
Tarim River water to obtain salinity concentrations that are less damaging to plant growth.
E,venso, the salinity is still too high for most of the year (i.e. > 1 gll) to meet health criteria for
human consumption.

The second option is not part of the TB I1 project and is therefore unlikely to be achieved. In
fact there have been recent moves to increase Aksu Prefecture's irrigation water allocation.
The third and fourth sources require a reduction in either non-beneficial evaporation (NBE)
and/or an increase in irrigation water use efficiency, including canal efficiencies. Measures to
address both aspects are part of TB I1and therefore this is a viable source.

Section 5.1 briefly discussed the issue of the 150 km of embankments proposed along the
middle GC as part of TB 11. They are intended to augment the eight proposed off-take
regulators in the upper and middle GCs. Both measures are designed to reduce NBE. The
regulators have the potential to achieve the objective without a high likelihood of reduced GC
health in the upper and middle GCs, if managed in accordance with known environmental
needs in those areas. The effect of the embankments, however, will be to reduce flood
frequency over the floodplain below natural levels.           As there has already been a large
reduction in overbank flows caused by upstream water use, the effect of the embankments will
be to compound this reduction in flooding.

The fifth option effectively requires a decrease in NBE associated with irrigation and non-
commercial uses.      It could also be achieved through the re-allocation of water between
irrigation and non-commercial uses, so that more water goes to the environment with no
increase in efficiencies. As with the upstream areas, there is physically scope to improve
water use efficiencies with the institution of management and structural measures, but as the
State Farms are excluded from TB 11, this is not likely to be achieved. In effect, by excluding
State Farms from TB 11any measures to reallocate more water to the environment, will benefit

them. State Farms should not be treated any differently fiom any other irrigation area. To do
so creates distortions and inequities, both for the State Farm people and others. In particular,
it creates yet another layer of secrecy about data and makes it all the more difficult for
agencies like the TNIB to manage the river based on accurate and timely data.

There is no question that the single most important measure that can be used to source larger
volumes of water to the LGC in a sustained manner, is the determination and implementation
of firm average annual water allocations between the Prefectures. These must be defined in
such a way that:

1. All stakeholders, particularly the Prefectures and Counties, understand and agree to abide
    by the allocation principles;

2. They are measurable in real time so that water use adjustments can be made to protect
    flows immediately;

3. The real time decisions can be audited within a short time of the end of the water year to
    assess compliance and correct any problems with the involvement of all stakeholders;

4. They reflect the natural annual and intra-annual flow variability that existed prior to large
    scale water use;

5. They take account of natural water losses in each reach of the TR; and,

6. They can be adjusted to allow for changing circumstances and information on the
    condition of the GC in all reaches, upper, middle and lower, gathered through on-going
    monitoring.

The second most important measure in sourcing water, is to prevent the illegal or quasi-legal
reclamation of land for irrigation which is still occurring. This would be best done by altering
the hnding arrangements of some County and Prefecture level agencies, such that they do not
gain such significant financial benefits through land reclamation fees, land management fees
and water management fees. In part it has been addressed by the recent decision requiring all
approvals to be forwarded to the relevant Prefecture agencies for endorsement. However,
such is the level of over use of water in the TB, that all water use should be capped and new
developments required to buy allocations from existing users.           Such transferability of
allocations should include a substantial percentage reduction in volume, to regain some water
for the environment, as there is ample evidence that the whole river system is significantly
stressed by water shortage and the attendant increase in water and land salinisation.

1. River channel erosion and sedimentation.

2. Maintenance of important physical floodplain features, including wetlands and flood
   channels.

3. Stability of desert sediments adjacent to the GC.

4. Assessment of the causes and mitigating factors related to dust and sand storms.

There is currently no bedload movement monitoring and little coordination between agencies
to integrate the findings of what data is collected (see the comments in the water quality
section below). There is a need to develop conceptual models of the way in which river
flows, groundwater and floodplain flows contribute to the maintenance of the GC. Current
hypotheses require refinement for monitoring to be able to enumerate the links suggested
above. There is little river channel erosion in the LGC, however, there is substantial erosion
in upstream reaches and the major tributaries. It is from theses sources that the cascade of
temporary sediment stores derive their material.       The changes in supply, transport and
deposition, brought about by human activities requires a more integrated development of
system diagrams and eventually, conceptual models, of how the whole process works.


6.2.2 MONITORIWC;FRARIF:WORK
1. Determine locations and scale of erosion. Utilise remote sensing to determine lateral
   movement of the river channel at benchmark locations from Aler to Alegan.

2. Conduct studies to determine the scale and frequency of alluvial sediment movement,
    including suspended and bedload sediment transport in the river and floodplain deposition.
   Field studies are required to determine the type of sediments being eroded, including
    particle size characteristics, the geomorphic features being eroded and the rate of erosion
    relative to likely natural rates. These studies need to be integrated with the hydrologic
    assessment.

3. Assess the role of channel formation by meandering verses channel avulsion (i.e. sudden
    changes in channel location) in creating floodplain features, including flood channels and
    wetlands.

4. Determine the role of fluvial verses aeolian processes in shaping the TR floodplain in each
    reach. Reduced river flows and flooding lead to increasing movement of sand in and
    adjacent to the GC. Dune stability adjacent to the GC will need to be assessed with
    respect to the stabilising effects of semi-arid vegetation dependent on groundwater.
    Transport of aeolian material deposited on the floodplain requires study through
    stratigraphic examination of floodplain sediments, as well as entrainmenthurial studies
    conducted during current floods to determine the extent of reworking of aeolian
    sediments.

5. Monitor sand and dust storms at benchmark locations. Parameters should include wind
    direction and strength during and prior to each event, prevailing weather patterns, time of
    year, vegetation cover/condition in the upwind direction and at the monitoring site,
    alkalinity and particle size distribution of the sediments, chemical pollutants, effects in
    terms of crops, livestock, human health, roads, other infrastructure and human activities.

6.3 I-1YI)KOLOGIC I'AKAMETEKS

6.3.1 SURFACEWATER

6.3.1.1 Key Issues
1 . Access and use of existing historical data sets.

2. Data requirements for the LGC if flows are re-instated.

3. Analysis and integration of monitoring into real-time decision making.

4. Monitoring of flow breakouts and irrigation diversions.

6.3.1.2 Monitoring Framework
1 . Existing data collected at Aler, Xinqiman and other National level stations need to be
    made available in real-time to the TMB and to all relevant Prefecture agencies. Currently
    those data can not be considered to be part of the monitoring network as they are not made
    available at the time of recording, even in preliminary form, and the archived data is not
    capable of being used, even by the TMB, without referral and payment to the relevant
    department. Daily flow data should be available daily.

2. All existing gauging stations would benefit from a review of the data collection
    procedures including the lateral extent of high flow gauging, calculation of rating curves,
    conversion of stage heights to discharges, data storage and labelling. The use of river flow
    data as a basic input to many other analyses places greater emphasis on data assurance for
    this parameter.

3. There are no gauging stations downstream of Qiala. The reinstatement of flows will
    require flows to be monitored at Yinsu, Alegan and Taitema. Gauging stations will need
    to be established at those locations, with the exception of the later if flows are only
    targeted to Alegan.

4. Flows are to be determined for all occasions that water quality samples are taken for the
    calculation of loads and for correlation with discharge rates.

5. Existing information on diversions for irrigation and pasture need to be upgraded by
    accurate monitoring of all significant diversions. These data should be made available to
    the TMB within 6 months of the event. Periodic gauging of all major breakouts is also
    needed to confirm the location and scale of river "losses".

6. Return irrigation drainage flows and any other return flows to the TR should be
    monitored.

7. All data should be either daily, or capable of being dissaggregated to daily flows by
    recording homogenous periods. The actual dates on which conditions change should be
    recorded in the raw data.


6.3.2 SURFACEWATER        QUALITY

6.3.2.1 Key Issues
1 . Increasing salinity levels particularly in spring.

2. High levels of suspended sediment.

3. Potential eutrophication.

4. Lack of coordination and access to data.

5. Poor data labelling, including lack of dates and definition of terms.

Water quality monitoring in the Tarim Basin appears to be fragmented. It is possibly done at
infrequent intervals by different agencies, with little exchange of data between them.
Consequently, the value of any such monitoring for management on a basin wide perspective
is limited. The first recommendation would therefore be to address this, and centralise all
monitoring under the control of one lead body, such as the TBWRC, which should be
responsible for coordinating Basin-wide data collection and management.             The actual
monitoring should be conducted by existing agencies, within a coordinated holistic framework
provided by the TMWRC. The coordination would include the prescription of sampling and
analysis methods, frequency, data archiving formats and protocols, data quality coding
(indicating for example compromised data or estimated data), data sharing procedures and
reporting.

Secondly, the objectives of the monitoring program would need to be clearly defined, and the
monitoring program tailored around these objectives. A primary object would be to minimise
the impacts of salinity/mineralisation on the water quality of the Tarim River, and of its major
tributaries. However, other potential water quality problems such as sediment load and
eutrophication should not be ignored.

Thirdly, a water quality monitoring program will need to meet the resource management needs
of the basin. This should come through the setting of objectives, where the level of water
quality protection required will also need to be defined. This level may include protecting the
environmental quality of the surface water, protecting irrigation water quality, or protecting a
raw drinking water source for humans and animals, or for industrial or domestic use.


6.3.2.2 Monitoring Framework
The following are two sampling monitoring programs, one detailed, the other more
fundamental, for consideration to meet future water quality needs, as appropriate. They are
based on the water quality monitoring program undertaken on the Murray-Darling system in
Australia by the Murray Darling Basin Commission. A systems diagram of the Tarim River
and the proposed monitoring network is presented in Working Paper 4.

1. Detailed Program:

This program is based on the water quality monitoring program of the Murray Darling basin
Commission, superimposed on the Tarim Basin.

Sampling Sites. Sampling sites should be located along the mainstream of the Tarim River
and on all tributary streams, both upstream of irrigation areas, and downstream. It may also
be necessary to establish monitoring points on the major irrigation drainage channels leading
out of the irrigation areas and discharging back into the Tarim River or its major tributaries.
These points will not only give an indication of the suitability of the water entering various
sections of the Tarim River and its tributaries for irrigation and other human use, and for
environmental protection, but also the downstream monitoring will give an indication of any
impacts on water quality caused by activities within these areas. Coupling water quality
results with river flow data will allow the calculation of loads of pollutants entering and
leaving various parts of the river system. Suggested sites are:

1. The mainstream Tarim River sites should include Aler, Xinqiman, Yinbazar, and Qiala.
   Another site further downstream at Alegan is suggested, to monitor the water quality of
   environmental releases for the lower "Green Corridor".

2. The Hotan River sites should include Uruluwati and Tongguziluke, located on the two
   major branches of the Hotan upstream of the irrigation area, and Xiao Ta, on the Hotan just
   upstream of its discharge point to the Tarim River.

3. There should be at least two sites on the Yenqing River, one upstream of the irrigation
   areas, and onejust prior to its discharge point to the Tarim River.

4. The Aksu River has two major branches upstream of the irrigation area. The existing
   hydrographic monitoring stations on each of these branches, at Shuliguilanke and Shihelu
   should also be used as water quality monitoring stations. The site on the lower Aksu River
   is still within the irrigation area of this river. Another site further downstream, closer to the
   Aksu's junction with the Tarim, so that the majority of the irrigation areas are upstream,
   would be preferred if possible. Drainage waters from the Aksu irrigation area will require
   monitoring, as these are discharged back to the river.

5. Monitoring sites on the Kashgar and Weigan Rivers would be of benefit, even though these
   rivers do not contribute surface water flows to the Tarim. Monitoring of irrigation drainage
   returns from the Weigan irrigation area that flow to the Tarim River need to be monitored.

6. A monitoring point on the Konque River at Yuli or Puhui, or another location upstream
   from where diversions to Qiala Reservoir occur, should also be included in the monitoring
   program.

Parameters to measure. The parameters to measure should focus on those known to cause
water quality problems in the river system, are considered likely to have an impact, such as
mineralisation and suspended solids. However those indicative of the overall ecological
health of the river system such as pH or dissolved oxygen should also be included. Suggested
parameters include:

Of primary importance (Class 1)' pH, salinity/mineralisation/electricalconductivity (one of
these 3 parameters is sufficient), turbidity, and temperature. Most of these could be measured
in the field, in situ, if the appropriate field instrumentation, backup support and training were
provided.

Additionally important parameters (Class 2) would include nitrate, total nitrogen, total
phosphorus, suspended solids, COD and BODS.

Class 3 parameters would include the major cations and anions, in particular sodium,
magnesium, calcium, chloride, sulphate and bicarbonate.

Sampling Frequency. Class 1 parameters could be measured weekly, especially if measured
in situ in the field. However fortnightly may be sufficient if samples have to be delivered to a
laboratory for analyses. Class 2 and Class 3 parameters should be sampled monthly.


2.       Basic Program

This program suggests a basic sampling program to meet the resource management and
environmental protection needs of the Tarim Basin, but acknowledging the budgetary and
other constraints under which the resource management agencies must work.

Sampling sites. Sampling sites should include Aler, Xinqiman, Yinbazar and Qiala along the
mainstream Tarim River, and sites on the Hotan, Yenqing and Aksu Rivers just upstream of
their confluence with the Aksu. Major irrigation drainage outfalls should be monitored close
to where they discharge to the rivers. The diversion between the Konque River and Qiala
Reservoir should also be monitored.

Parameters to measure. Salinitylmineralisation is of major importance. Other parameters
that will provide basic coverage of the water quality in the mainstream Tarim River include
pH, suspended solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, COD, sulphate and
chloride. Nitrate could also be measured. These parameters provide sufficient coverage of
the water quality to be able to assess compliance with both the Chinese environmental quality
standard for surface water (GB 3838-88), and irrigation water quality (GB 5084-92).

Sampling frequency. Neither of the two Chinese water quality standards (environmental
quality or irrigation quality) specify a sampling frequency.         However Point 2.1 of the
environmental quality standard does stipulate "it is not allowed to employ the single
instantaneous monitoring value when using this standard". Therefore a routine monitoring
frequency    is   necessary.       The    minimal     monitoring    frequency    suggested    for
salinitylmineralisation assessment would be monthly, although this could be carried out more
frequently if dependable in-the-field monitoring can be achieved. The other parameters that
require laboratory analyses should be monitored preferably monthly, but at quarterly intervals
at the very minimum. A more frequent sampling frequency may be considered necessary at
high priority locations such as Aler, and during certain periods of the year, such asjust prior to
and throughout the irrigation period.


6.3.3 Soil, AKD GI<OLNDN..\~'ERP.\KARII.:TERS

6.3.3.1 Key Issues

1 . Salinisation of land within irrigation areas and natural areas of the GC.

2. Declining groundwater levels throughout the GC, but particularly, the LGC downstream of
    Daxihaizi.

3. increasing groundwater salinity in all areas and particularly near irrigation areas.

4. Lack of knowledge about groundwater recharge rates, lateral flow rates and discharge
    rateslareas.

6.3.3.2 Monitoring Framework
1. Groundwater monitoring piezometers should be installed within and adjacent to all
    irrigation areas. Additional piezometers should be installed at representative locations
    along surveyed cross-sections across the entire floodplain. There should be at least three
    cross-sections in each reach, i.e. Qiala to Daxihaizi, Daxihaizi to Yinsu, Yinsu to Alegan
    and Alegan to Taitema Lake preferably coincident in timing and location to sites where
    surface water is monitored.

2. Water levels should be monitored every 3 months for 2 years to determine seasonal
    variations, then twice a year after that before and after the summer flood. Water quality
    samples should be taken on one occasion in the first year and analysed for TDS, pH, major
    ions, alkalinity, mineralisation (as defined by Xinjiang agencies for comparison to
    historical river data). The same parameters should be analysed each year for selected sites.
    Dates are to be recorded for all sampling. Ongoing measurement of salinity should be
    conducted using calibrated field equipment.

3. Pump tests should be conducted on a number of new monitoring bores sunk to at least 20
    m. One monitoring bore in each of the Qiala to Daxihaizi and Daxihaizi to Yinsu reaches
    would be required to give some idea of geophysical conditions (single or multiple
    aquifers) and transmissivities. Full particle size analyses should be conducted on samples
    from each strata taken during the bore drilling.

4. Surface salinisation should be monitored using satellite imagery and ground verification.
   The area of salinisation should be calculated for each year for each reach, using pre-flood
   imagery, unless other seasons prove more reliable. For instance, vegetation stress indices
   may be able to be developed that reflect salinity levels rather than moisture stress, to
   augment mapping of bare soil salinisation.         Salinisation mapslimages (complete with
   dates, methodology, etc) need to be made available to all relevant stakeholders, not just
   the enumerated figures for each reach, as the location of such areas relative to irrigation
   and other areas, is critical to determining their importance in terms of cause and effect.



6.4 ECOLOGICAL PARAMETERS
6.4.1 KEYISSUES
6.4.1.1 Aquatic and Terrestrial Fauna
1. There is little information on fish and other aquatic biota.

2. Fisheries based on the 3 endemic species have collapsed and those species are either
    extinct or nearly so.

3. There is little or no information on the aquatic ecology of the TR in relation to critical
    hydrologic, geomorphic and nutriendfood parameters.

4. There are no specific data on the presence and requirements of terrestrial animals and
    waterbirds in the LGC.


6.4.1.2 Green Corridor Vegetation Condition

1. The condition of the LGC is severely degraded, but not quantified for management goal
    setting.

2. The relationships between the condition of the GC and human uses for grazing, firewood,
    herbs, shelter, windbreaudust suppression, desert barrier, aesthetics, etc, are not
    established.


6.4.2 M O ~ I T O RFRAMEN'ORI<
                       I Y ~

6.4.2.1 Aquatic and TerrestrialFauna
1. Fish monitoring is required near each of the major hydrologic monitoring stations along
    the river so that all parameters can be easily analysed for establishing habitat condition.
    The locations should include river, wetland and backwater areas. Sampling effort should
    be quantified so that catch per unit effort can be defined for each species. Age class,
    species, sex and other biological parameters should be collected that permit catch and
    release. Only a small sub-sample, if any, should be killed for more information on sexual
    condition, etc. No specimens of endangered species should be killed.

2. Macroinvertebrate sampling should be conducted near each of the major hydrologic
    monitoring stations, to determine the composition of taxa (identified to family level at
    least) and if possible abundance (through semi-quantitative sampling techniques).

3. Monitoring of terrestrial reptile and mammal fauna is required at benchmark locations in
    each reach of the GC. This should be conducted using techniques specific to each type of

    animal but quantified where possible in terms of search effort, by area and time, so that
    abundances can be ascribed and compared over time.

4. Monitoring of waterbirds is required in autumn and spring, so as to pick up migratory
    species. It may be possible to use volunteer assistance by international bird watching
    organisations. By covering their costs only, this may be a cheap and effective means of
    obtaining the information, whilst communicating the importance that China places on the
    rehabilitation of the LGC to the world. Monitoring locations should be throughout the
    GC. In the LGC, they should include Qiala and Daxihaizi Reservoirs, salt lakes on the
    periphery of the GC, wetlands, the TR, flood channels and irrigation areas. Sightings
    should be recorded by species, sex, time of day, date, location, habitat, breeding status,
    behaviour, etc.


6.4.2.2 Green Corridor Vegetation Condition

1. At present the only activity between Qiala and Daxihaizi is conducted by the State Farms.
    The only information that is made available on State Farm activities is provided in State
    Farm Year Books. This information can be difficult to access and does not report on all
    State Farms to the same extent each year. The study team was unable to access any
    information from the State Farms on the extent and condition of the GC in the Q-D reach.

2. Below Daxihaizi there are less than 100 herder households. There will be none by 2000 if
    current plans to relocate these households are carried out. In effect there will be no
    resident populations to report on and/or monitor the extent and condition of the GC
    downstream of Daxihaizi.

3. However, there is a need to monitor both the extent and condition of the GC in both the Q-
    D and D-T reaches and to assess the extent to which artificial tree planting and
    maintenance is being undertaken by the State Farms in the vicinity of cropping activities.

Monitoring the extent and condition of the LGC could be a costly business in the absence of a
resident population and difficult to access State Farm data. It can of course be done by using
satellite imagery (or aerial photography) and ground truthing. If these techniques cannot be
reliably funded and sustained over several decades alternative measures should be considered.

For example, it might be possible to evolve an ongoing approach that is affordable and can be
sustained using existing resources and some strategic observation points. The aim would be
to observe changes in the extent and condition of the LGC and to correlate these with the
presence or absence of possible causal factors. An initial hypothesis would be required that
can be progressively evolved against empirical observation to provide a better understanding
of how the extent and condition of the LGC actually changes in response to prevailing
circumstances. To do this the monitoring might focus on:

(a)    the location of existing wells, the depth to water in these areas (or well depth if dry), and
       an annual check on a selected sample of these. If the wells are being used the well users
       could be asked to collect this information on a more regular basis.

(b)    the distance to significant sand dunes from selected and easily identified points along
       the road and/or major water channels of the TR system.

(c)    several (maybe 5 perhaps 10) observation areas that should be set up according to a
       stratified statistical design. These areas need to be marked to the extent that they can be
       reliably returned to in the future. Individual replicate areas might cover areas of perhaps

100 to 250 m2. In these areas a detailed documentation of all flora should be
periodically made by species and condition.

The key points to take into account in setting up and monitoring these observation areas
would include:

  frequency of documenting all flora should be related to the location of the
  observation area, the flora it contains and the incidence of events that might influence
  the extent and condition of the flora in each area. In some instances it may be worth
  documenting the area annually for a few years. In some instances it could be every
  two years, every five years and in some instances perhaps longer;

  choosing the season in which the flora is to be documented. In most instances this
  will be a season in which plant growth can be observed. At these times species, if
  present, are more readily found, more easily identified, the numbers present can be
  more accurately assessed and some assessment of the condition of each species can
  be made;

   locating one or two observation points close to wells;

   locating most observation areas where there are:
    >   a number of species to be observed so that changes in the number and condition
        of the species will provide enough information to recognise and map the extent
        and condition of the GC and allow this to be compared with a range of possible
        causal factors.
    >   the presence of factors that it is hypothesised might influence the extent and
        condition of the GC.. These factors would include; specific types of riverine
        geomorphology; a possibility of a river flow; the suspected presence of
        groundwater (even if not it is not possible to physically check its existence and
        depth in all instances), the presence and numbers (grazing pressure) of any
        human and/or livestock and/or native fauna; and evidence of sand blast and/or
        wind erosion;

   observation areas should be selected both along and across the GC within areas
   where some flora remains alive. For each area there should be an underlying
   hypothesis that will allow the information collected to be used to:

   define landforms and systems within the GC;

   test and hrther evolve initial hypotheses as to the factors that give rise to these land
   forms and systems; and

   eventually derive some empirical norms for sustainable GC management by
   landform;

   the possibility of locating some if not all of the observation areas along transects.
   Variations in the existence of flora and fauna by species and condition along the
   transect, over time could then be recorded and related to the presence of factors that
   are hypothesised to cause the variations observed.

   the need to periodically change the location of some observation points (close
   existing and open new points) and some transects.            This would be done to
   progressively derive a better distribution of observation points relative to the types of

         information about the extent and condition of the landforms that make up the LGC
         and .

(d)  using local knowledge, building on existing programs and employing herders who did or
     still live in the LGC.

     For example, these herders could be used to locate the wells, record depth to water or
     depth of dry wells, identify appropriate observation points, possible transects, identify
     and count the plant populations in the observation points and pace out distance to
     nearest sand dunes at selected roadlriver channel locations. They could be trained to do
     this in the areas in which they are currently residing and working and be periodically
     transported to the LGC to make the observations required. If they were also engaged to
      do this in various sections of the Yinbazar to Qiala reach there would be an opportunity
     to develop techniques to observe and record cropping, other land uses and human and
      livestock areas, numbers and activities. In addition to biomass and depth to water table
      in the Yinbazar to Qiala reach, herders could be used to record the depth, extent, and
     times over which surface water may be present and where salinisation is occurring. The
      additional information would assist develop the hypotheses and empirical norms for
      better managing the GC. It would be particularly useful to better managing the LGC if
      and when additional water can be made available and some level of restoration starts to
      occur.

Evolving an on-going affordable approach to monitoring the extent and condition of the GC
should be a joint effort by the Baying01 Forestry and Animal Husbandry Bureaus. It could be
prepared as a free-standing project. Over a five year period it could be developed to leave a
number of community watch type operations sustainably in place. The ultimate objective
would be to create a resident community that would be the custodians of the environments
they currently exploit and a primary source of verifiable field level data.

A project approach would provide an opportunity to fund some basic equipment and establish
some initial hypotheses.     It would also provide an opportunity to introduce and adapt
appropriate techniques for monitoring fragile desert type environments from elsewhere in the
world. These would include the need to:

         evolve appropriate conceptual models;

         define realistic measurable environmental outcomes;

         identify and use specific natural features and indicator flora and fauna species to
         discern improvements and/or the degradation in various land forms and habitats; and

         evolve community watch groups and auto-recording by the land users themselves, as
         critical elements in any attempt to devise sustainable and affordable protective or
         restoration programs.



6.5 SOClO-ECONOMIC PARAMETERS

Total populations of people and households by gender and age should be kept and collated by
hamlet and village. The utilities (water, electricity, effluent disposal), communications (road,
post, telephone), social (health and education) and extension (agriculture, livestock, forestry
and environmental management) services that are available at hamlet and village level need to
be documented. The extent to which all of these can be physically accessed, financially

afforded by the local community according to household income, and are actually used (how
often, by whom each month or quarter), needs to be assessed.

The numbers of households by annual disposable income for each of the different types of
households in each hamlet and village needs to be estimated and recorded. It also needs to be
expressed on a return per labour day basis.

The nutritional adequacy of local diets relative to international norms needs to be assessed.
The number of households by type of household actually experiencing internationally
acceptable levels of nutrition need to be determined. Methods of identifiing and assisting
households not experiencing these levels of nutrition, need to be devised.

The impact of prevailing policies, guidelines and directives on the incentives and
disincentives that prevail at the individual household, individual investor, county, prefecture,
province and regional levels need to be analysed, reported and monitored. The impact of
these policies, guidelines and directives on the various organisational investors, institutes,
bureaus and commissions who are, or may be in a position to influence, decision makers also
needs to be analysed, reported and monitored.



7. CONCLUSIONS
1. The present condition of the LGC is highly degraded. The lower two thirds is largely
    dead, i.e. downstream of Yinsu, and all herdsmen have been moved out. There appears to
    be little wildlife remaining and there is no surface water a short distance downstream of
    Daxihaizi Reservoir at any time of the year.

2. The entire LGC, from Qiala to Taitema Lake, is not capable of being "saved" without
    restoring very large volumes of water on an annual basis. A minimum quantity in the
    order of 300 x 106 m3/year will be required to even maintain and restore the upper portions
    of the LGC between Qiala and Yinsu and partial restoration of the reach from there to
    Alegan. Groundwater is the main mechanism slowing the degradation since the last
    significant surface flows in 1974, but as groundwater levels have been falling, there is a
    large volume that needs to be made up initially, probably in the order of 1.5 x lo9 m3 for
    the whole LGC reach.

3. Anything much more than the minimum volume quoted above is unlikely to be made
    available in the foreseeable future given the increasing economic and population pressures
    in the basin.

4. The economic value of the LGC is for all practical purposes, at least equal to the value of
    the foregone production if the volume of water supplied to the LGC to restore it, were to
    be used elsewhere. Therefore the greater the volume of water used to restore the LGC the
    greater the value that is placed on it. Until action is taken the value is effectively the
    economic and social value of the State Farms only, with zero value for the remainder.
    The socio-economic value of the LGC is currently RMB 180 million Yuan. On an
    ongoing annual basis, excluding relocation costs (i.e. social costs), the economic value is
    RMB 11.2 million Yuan.

5 .  The social value is largely confined to preventing the relocation of about 30% of the
     40,500 people (say a total of 2,700 household relocations) from the five State Farms if the
     LGC were to collapse and the only water available to State Farms was reduced to the

     water that can be purchased from the Kongque River, as all herdsmen have previously
     been relocated or are in the process of being moved (only 50 families remain).

6. The most unique ecological value prior to degradation was the physical link to the
    southern regions of the basin, including the Tibetan Plateau. This link has been broken
   and consequently the movement of individual fish, terrestrial fauna, plant propogules
   (seeds, bulbs, cuttings, etc), birds and genetic flow, is now disrupted. The remaining link
   is the Hotan River and the semi-arid and montane areas of Kashgar to the west.

7. The actual habitat of the LGC is not significantly different to that of other areas of the
   green corridor along the Tarim River or its major tributaries, which in any one area is
   highly diverse and dynamic over short periods of geological time. Even in human life
   times, significant natural changes can be observed in flow paths and vegetation. Human
    land and water use have accelerated many of these changes and slowed others.

8. Restoring the LGC has the potential to (negatively) impact significantly on the ecological
   and socio-economic values of the middle Green Corridor in particular, because of the river
   embankments proposed in the Tarim Basin I1Project, to minimise the spill of water in that
   reach. There are no existing studies that quantitatively assess these potential impacts.

9. The ecological value of any one area of the Green Corridor anywhere in the Tarim Basin
   can not be properly assessed without knowing the extent, character and health of the entire
    Green Corridor.

10. The flow of salt and sediment needs to be more intensively studied and managed. There is
    a paucity of information on which to base effective management decisions. In both cases,
   the optimal solution involves modifying the human factors that have lead to increased salt
    and sediment inputs to the Basin's rivers. However, many other measures will be required
    to deal with existing loads and secondary problems.

11. The natural environment of the GC, including that of the LGC is not wasteful of water as
    is common perception. Average annual water use was in the order of 4,500 m3/ha,a small
    volume compared to irrigation water use which ranges from 7,000 to 15, 000 m3/ha in the
    TB. Therefore, in seeking the large volumes required to restore the LGC, it is not possible
    to significantly reduce overall annual water use by the environment in the upper and
    middle GCs. Any increases in spills in those reaches due to excavated breakouts are
    relatively insignificant compared to the reductions in high flow "losses" caused by reduced
    flood size and frequency through upstream water use, i.e. the upper and middle GC is
    already significantly degraded though a halving of water availability.

12. Sustainable environmental management of the TR's GC depends on evaluating the whole
    GC resource and managing it in an integrated manner that recognises links and water
    allocation constraints. These links and constraints will be key to the establishment of
    priorities for environmental restoration between and within reaches.

8. RECOMMENDATIONS

8.1 RECOMMENDED MEASURES FOR REI-IABILITATION OF THE 1,OWER
GREEN COHKIIIOR


1. If a decision is taken to deliver water to the LGC to assist meeting environmental needs,
   then a firm average allocation of at least 300 x lo6 m3 should be made and implemented.
   However, this should not be at the expense of the upper and middle GCs' environments.
   This water would, in effect, come from the KaiduIKongque system.

2. Establish a monitoring program based on the outline in Section 6.

3. All monitoring and analysis for the specific management of TR flows, diversions,
   irrigation returns, water quality and land salinisation, should be developed and coordinated
   through the TBWRC supported by the TMB. Other agencies would supply monitoring
   services using budgets explicitly allocated for the purpose, via the TBWRC. All relevant
   data not directly commissioned by the TBWRC would be made available at minimal cost
   and with no restriction on its use except on-selling for monetary gain. The TBWRC is to
   oversee the resolution of any areas of dispute.

4. Develop and constantly refine conceptual models for the ecological/physical processes,
   socio-economic processes and planning/policy/administration processes. These models
   must be capable of simplification for presentation, discussion and agreement amongst all
   stakeholders.    Where agreement can not be obtained, this will highlight areas to be
   investigated though specific research programs.

5. Integrate the management of the State Farms into overall TR management so that they are
   treated the same as other irrigation areas. This may require a change of State Farm
   reporting structures from National to Provincial governments.

6. Alter land and water management administration to provide for the free flow of data in a
   timely and low cost manner. The issue of agency funding is inseparable from this analysis
   and overhaul.

7. Increase the finding and technical capacity of the TMB so that it can carry out its charter
   as established by the TBWRC, i.e. the integrated management of the TR and related
   resources. Strengthening the Bureau's ecological, modelling and remote sensing capacity
   is critical to the TBWRC developing an effective management capability, for in-house
   work and the coordination of services by more specialised agencies.

8.2.1 KEYMAIVAGEMEN.~       QLIESTIONS

Further research is needed to determine the following:

Goal setting questions:

1. What ecological and socio-economic values do all the green corridors of all the rivers in
   the Tarim River basin have? i.e. what is the total resource and its value?

2. What proportion of those values/functions were performed by the upper, middle and lower
   green corridors of the Tarim River and its major tributaries, prior to large scale water
   resource development and now?

3. What quantity and quality of habitat do the people of China, Xinjiang and the Tarim Basin
   want overall and in individual rivers and the upper, middle and lower Tarim River? What
   stakeholders need to be involved and what processes can be used to facilitate the
    determination of these measurable goals?

Hydrologic and geomorphological questions:

With respect to the Tarim River main stem and the major tributaries:

1 . What volume and quality of water is required to achieve various levels of restoration?

2. What is the seasonal timing, flow rates and durations required at different locations?

   resources development and land reclamation?

6. What are the specific effects of water storage, abstraction and river training works on
    sediment flow and river channel stability?

    numbers/range ? And what species are decreasing andlor becoming extinct?

4. What are the migration patterns of fish, birds and terrestrial fauna?

5. What are the critical components or parameters of the hydrologic and physical
    environment for key and/or endangered species?

6. Is it possible to model some critical elements of ecosystem response to river flows,
    particularly flooding, so that real-time decisions, or at least retrospective assessments of
    water utilisation, can be made in ecologically relevant terms?

Monitoring questions:

1. What parameters are the most efficient in terms of management knowledge per dollar, to
  effectively monitor the condition of the green corridor?

2. What data are best captured by remote sensing, ground based surveys or by indirect
  means, such as known relationships to river flows?

3. How should the data be collected, stored, distributed, analysed and linked to improved
   management decisions?

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 PROJECT CONTEXT
The "Lower Green Corridor" (LGC) is the area naturally and artificiallyirrigated by the Tarim
River, downstream of Qiala Reservoir to Taitema Lake, i.e. it is the Tarim River and its
floodplain, including flood channels and "dry rivers". This area is surrounded by the Kuluk
Desert to the east and the Taklimakan Desert to the west (Figure 1). A fbll description is
provided in Section 2.

The World Bank fbnded Tarim Basin I Project (completed in 1997)and Tarim Basin I1 Project
(in progress) are intended to achieve socio-economic benefits for poor farmers through
sustainable rehabilitation and development of irrigated agriculture. The projects also aim to
improve the greatly deteriorated environment of the "Green Corridor", which, at least at one
time, had considerable socio-economic and ecologicalvalues.

This Technical Assistance (TA), "Integrated Environmental Management in the Tarim Basin,
Xinjiang Province, China", relates to whether and how water saved through the structural and
management measures of the Tarim I1 Project could be used to improve the environmental
condition of the LGC and thereby socio-economic conditions. The TA was also to quantify
the ecological and socio-economic values, so that rational and objective decisions can be
made about the reallocation of the scarce water resource saved through component projects of
the Tarim Basin I1Project. The five objectivesof the TA are listed in Section 1.2.

Package 1 has provided a preliminary assessment of these values and criteria, and established
a framework for an environmental monitoring program that can be conducted through the
Tarim I1 Project. It also recommends specific environmentalresearch studies to be conducted
as part of Package I1of this Technical Assistance. Package I1 is tentatively scheduled to begin
in late 1999.


1.2 OBJECTIVES
The Tarim Basin Green Corridor Environmental Management component of Package 1 has
the following objective:

   To identrfi the broad constraints within which current andfuture development can occur
   without further destroying the Tarim River's environmental assets and to identzfi
   opportunitiesfor restoration or enhancement.

Through the preparation of an environmental baseline study, five specific objectives will be
addressed:

1. To determine the major changes in the extent and character of the Tarim River and its
   "green corridor" since the inception of large scale water use and river regulation.

2. To make a preliminary assessment of the value of the river and "green corridor" in
   ecological and socio-economicterms.

3. To determine the broad water quality and quantity conditions that will maintain or restore
   the ecosystems of the Tarim River and its "green corridor" to levels that match agreed local
   and regional expectations.

4. To input environmental values, constraints and management options to the development of
   the Tarim Basin Master Plan primarily at the Insight Workshop.

5. To identify a framework for the development of monitoring needs and make
   recommendations for the environmental studies to be conducted in Package 2.



2. LOCATIONAND EXTENT
The Tarim River basin has an extremely arid continental climate. The many large and small
rivers draining the high mountains in the west, north and south of the catchment generally
flow into the two main rivers, the Tarim River and the Kaidu-Konque River system (Figure
1).  About 99% of the Basin's water resources are in the major rivers or the associated
aquifers. The Tarim River and its "green corridor" are about 1320 km long (Zhou Hai Yaje,
pers com) and are the only arable areas in the middle and eastern areas of the basin.

The surface and groundwater components of these two main systems join at the upper end of
the LGC in the vicinity of Aksupu Swamp, which used to receive water from both' rivers, then
diverge.. Both formerly flowed to Lop Nor Lake, the lowest point in the Basin, the Kongque
River via a northern route and the Tarim River via southerly one. The Tarim River used to be
joined by the Qarqan River, just to the east of Taitema Lake, before flowing east to Lop Nor
Lake.

Neither the Tarim or Kongque Rivers now reach Lop Nor, which began shrinking in the
1950's and was dry by the early 1970's. Lop Nor Lake used to have a surface area of over
3000 km2earlier this century, three times that of Bosten Lake. Neither does the Tarim River
reach Taitema Lake and it appears that neither does the Qarqan River, as Taitema Lake has
been dry since about 1974(Cheng, 1993,p183).

For the purposes of this report, the previous extent of the Tarim River from Taitema Lake to
Lop Nor Lake will be ignored, except to note the already reduced flows and river extent, prior
to the commencementof river flow records.

3. NATURALFEATURES

3.1 TOPOGRAPHY, SOILS AND GEOMORPHOLOGY
The floor of the Tarim Basin is formed by the Tian Shan Geosyncline and the Tarim Platform
(Cheng Qichou, 1993). The entire basin is surrounded by mountains rising to over 6,000 my
except to the east, where the mountains are lower and located beyond the Gobi Desert. The
Tarim River is located at the northern side of the Tarim Platform which is composed of
Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata overlain by about 800m of unconsolidated alluvial Quaternary
sediments in the vicinity of the LGC. The most recent of these sediments include the
alluvium of the Tarim River and the aeolian (wind blown) sands of the Kuluk and Taklimakan
Deserts.

The LGC is 428 km long from Qiala to Taitema Lake. It is about 5 - 30 km wide between
Qiala and Daxihaizi Reservoirs, and 1 - 3 km wide downstream of Alegan (Figure 1). Some
alluvial sediments underlie the desert sands, and in many areas there are deposits of aeolian
sands on the active floodplain. This is the result of shifts in the dynamic equilibrium between
the alluvial and aeolian forces. Periodic flood flows remove and redistribute invading dunes
which encroach on the floodplain during the periods between floods. This explains the
decreasing width of the LGC; the attenuation and reduction in flows downstream reduces the
power available to remove the aeolian sands.

Longitudinal river slopes are about 1/4000to 1/5000 from Aler to Yinbazar, 1/5000to 1/6000
Yinbazar to Qiala and about 114500 between Qiala and Daxihaizi Reservoirs (TBMB). This
slightly steeper slope in the last reach is linked to the lack of trees in the upper portion of the
reach where the slope is probably even higher. The combination of higher river slope and
flow attenuation in the middle reach, leads to a much reduced flooding frequency in upper
portion of the Qiala and Daxihaizi reach.

Data apparently exists to plot a longitudinal profile of the river bed, but only a small portion
of this could be accessed by the TA towards the close of this package. Those data that were
obtained, were surveyed from February 1990 to February 1991 (TBMB) and apparently by the
Baying01 Water Resources Bureau with financial assistance from the XPCC. The chainages
(distances) on the portions of long-sections obtained, would indicate that the entire river has
been traversed, as they are consistent with the known distances between those locations. A
longitudinal profile of the whole river, from Aler to Taitema, would assist in identifying the
causes of water losses, flooding frequency and the implications for sediment transport and
deposition, particularly where works are proposed to confine the river.

The cross-sectional information showszthat the cross-sectional area of the Tarim River
channel decreases downstream in all three reaches. At Xinqiman the bank-full capacity is
about 700 - 800 m3/s, which, due to 1.0 - 1.8 m of bed sedimentation over the past five or six
years, has been reduced from about 1,500 m3/s. Qiala it is about 75 m3/s and at Yinsu it is
about 27 m3/s (LGC Workshop, see Annex 8 of the LGC Report). This progressive reduction
is a consequence of flow attenuation, due to friction and storage losses as river flows traverse
each reach. The lack of tributaries along the Tarim River main-stem leads to a progressive
reduction in flow volume and peak discharges via this mechanism.

Observations during field inspections confirmed that the soils of the LGC are comprised
mostly of alluvial material, but include some aeolian sands. Little specific information could
be obtained on soil properties, such as particle size analysis, soil chemistry, structure and soil
horizons, however general soil descriptions in various reports, for Green Corridor soils

overall, indicate that there is little soil development.       The corridor's soils are largely
unmodified alluvial soils with little organic content, horizon development and structure.
Cheng (1993) reports that the alluvial sediments become finer in the downstream direction
and also as the floodplain is traversed laterally, from the river bed to the floodplain and higher
benches.

Fan Zi Li (1998) reports soil salinity levels (TDS) of 6.5 g/l in the top 60 mm of forest
meadow soil, but these levels drop rapidly to 1.2 g/l between 60 - 270 mm depth and to 0.043
g/l below 270 mm.        This reflects the surface accumulation of salt due to evaporation.
However, where groundwater levels were between 2 - 4 m, the salinity was about 5 dl,
between 6 - 10 m, 5 - 10 gll and in some areas up to 10 - 20 dl. Hence, at deeper levels, the
salinity levels rise again due to the evapotranspiration concentration of groundwater.



3.2 CLIMATE
Summary tables of average climate data are provided in Tables 1 to 4. Korla, Yuli and
Rouqiang best reflect the Lower Green Corridor (LGC), whilst Luatai is representative of the
middle Green Corridor (GC) (Figure 1).

It is evident that the basin has an extreme continental climate with sub-zero winter
temperatures and very high summer temperatures. Sunshine hours exceed 3000 hourdyear in
most places, reflecting the very low rainfalls shown in Table 3. As a consequence, almost
plants and animals in the lower elevations of the Tarim Basin rely on river flows and river fed
groundwater, for their survival. Some desert plants probably have the ability to accumulate
moisture the autumn and winter fogs to augment the meagre and erratic rainfall, for a brief
growing period in spring. Many desert plants near the GC also make use of groundwater, as is
evidenced by the decreasing density of plants within the dune areas with increasing distance
from the river.    In fact, normally floodplain species, such as Populus diversifolia (poplar
diversifolia) can be found in dune areas, apparently as a relic of times when the floodplain
formerly occupied those sites, but have been invaded by dunes as the river has changed
course. They are often quite healthy by surviving on groundwater.

The climate is a consequence of the Basin's location in the centre of the Asian land mass and
the surrounding mountains. The low precipitation is the main limiting factor on plant growth
and animal survival. This is compounded by the low winter temperatures, down to - 3 0 ' ~and
summer temperatures up to 3 9 ' ~ . In winter the Tarim River is covered by ice up to 0.6 m
thick, which begins to form in December and lasts until March. In summer evaporation
exceeds 0.2 m in July. Summer accounts for the bulk of the 2 m annual evaporation.

Various figures are quoted for the frequency of "disastrous weather" and the changes in
frequency and severity over the past few decades. This term is taken to mean sand and dust
storms. It is not necessarily relevant to quote those figures as the criteria could not be
ascertained, but the effect on crops can be severe. For instance, in 1998, the cotton crop had
to be planted three times before it was successful. In some cases this is due to burial by sand
or wind erosion. Caution is needed however, in ascribing all of this misfortune to adverse
weather conditions alone.     The high spring salinity of the river water could also be a
contributing or primary factor, the drying winds being the last straw in pushing the already salt
stressed seedlings beyond the recovery point.

The second point that needs to be made with respect to sand and dust storms, is the need to
objectively assess the likely sources of the wind blown material and the relative contributions
of those sources. Most reports that were made available to the team, implicitly assumed that
the degradation of the Green Corridor (including the LGC) was responsible for the increase in
frequency of events, i.e. there was a causal link with respect to the source of material and
therefore frequency and severity. It may be true that the Green Corridor could lessen the
impact of such events on crops and road maintenance, by at least dropping out some of the
sand fraction, but is unlikely that it would stop a dust storm. Nor would degradation of the
LGC be likely to significantly increase the amount of fine wind blown material, except locally
with respect to the sand fraction, as its area is very small relative to the desert and rangeland
areas. This could not be established with any certainty, due to the above mentioned lack of
available information on the criteria used to define "disastrous weather".

The dust storms, observed during the field inspections supported the view that the major
sources of material are the general rangelands and desert. The wind on one occasion was from

the north west, from the mountains and desert, and was drifting .sand across roads and towards
the Green Corridor. The trees and bushes within a healthy Green Corridor would help remove
the sand fraction by reducing ground wind speeds, which in fact was observed, but the actual
dust storm and the "event" was by no means ameliorated within the Green Corridor.



3.3 MAJOR HABITATS OF THE LOWER GREEN CORRIDOR

The LGC's habitats are not unique compared to habitats provided by the middle and upper
GCs. This conclusion was reached after examination of the available data and observations
made during the field trips to the middle and lower GCs (Appendixes D and E). On average,
it would appear that poplar diversifolia forests and other habitats were drier than those
upstream, receiving water in fewer years and possibly, for shorter durations. Certainly, flows
reach the LGC later than at upstream locations, up to 4 weeks later it would appear. The
floodplain is also much narrower than in the middle GC. The wettest and most frequent
flooding locations tend to be associated with locations where poplar diversifolia still occurs,
or previously occurred. The Lower Green Corridor was dependent on the frequency and
volume of these flood events.

There is considerable variation in the habitat along the LGC. Adjacent to the most upstream
sub-reach (Qiala to Daxihaizi) is Aksupu Swamp of several hundred thousand hectares, and
located between the two river systems east of Kuta Main Canal. More properly it should be
considered to be an integral component of the LGC, as it is fed by flood flows from the Tarim
River, via the Luohulike Swamp area, as well as the Kongque River. There is an underpass
under Kuta Main Canal, which can transmit flows from one swamp to the other, but this is
limited in size. Surface flow is perhaps possible from Aksupu Swamp to the Tarim River
floodplain, but whilst this is not certain, there is alost certainly a groundwater contribution.

It is not certain what vegetation occurred previously in Aksupu Swamp. The construction of
Aksupu Reservoir of about 1000-2000 ha' in its north west corner prevents it from receiving
flood waters from the Kongque River. Despite the observed reduction of flooding from
analysis of the hydrologic record, a satellite image for 1991 shows that several parts of
Aksupu swamp were flooded in that year.

Further downstream, the Kongque River in the past also transferred flows to the Tarim River
via the Ailik River. However, it is now dry due to a lack of flows in the Kongque River past
downstream of Aksupu Reservoir.

The upper portion of the Qiala to Daxihaizi reach also displays an unusual feature; there are
virtually no trees in the upper third of the reach, apparently due to the lack of flooding (Mr.
Lai pers com., see Appendix D) because of the steeper longitudinal slope. Conversely, there
is a moderate to good cover of reeds and shrubs, apparently supported by the high
groundwater levels in this reach. The remainder of the LGC has trees scattered throughout, at
various stand densities, in some areas rivalling that of densest stands in upstream reaches, and
in others, being relatively sparse. Considerable areas of Tarmarix sp. occur in the LGC in
drier locations than those that support Populus diversijolia.

The "Map of the Landscape of the Tarim River Drainage Area" (Anonymous, 1995b) shows
ephemeral salt lakes and marshes between the sand dunes along the fringe of the Taklimakan
Desert, between Qiala to Daxihaizi. Some of these are flooded seasonally by Daxihaizi


I This area seems too large, but was an oral quote supplied during a field inspection of the reservoir

Reservoir, but most now do not receive flooding. Some never did receive direct surface
flows, being isolated by intervening sand dunes, and are fed solely by groundwater. Most
support little vegetation, what does exist is generally around the perimeter, as can be observed
from the available false colour aerial photography and Landsat imagery (Anonymous, 1992,
Anonymous, 1995b). These types of habitats are potentially very important for migratory
waterbirds, but no records exist because of the high seasonal productivity of ephemeral
wetlands when they flooded (due to nutrient release dynamics). Some similar areas exist
along the upper and middle GCs.

Qiala and Daxihaizi Reservoirs provide considerable wetland habitat for waterbirds and fish.
To some extent they may replace some of the original more permanent wetland habitat.

The Tarim River's aquatic habitat in the LGC is not large compared to upstream reaches
considering the much narrower width (100 m maximum, compared to over 1000 m at Aler).
However, whether this narrow channel contains more than the average amount of ponded
areas at cease to flow, the only rehges for aquatic life in the very low flows and freezing
conditions of winter, is not known.


4. LAND AND WATER USE IN THE LGC

4.1 GRAZING
All the land to the north-east of the Tarim River, between Qiala and Daxihaizi Reservoirs, and
around the latter, is owned and controlled by the State Farms. These areas can not be grazed
without the approval of the State Farm. Approval has been granted local Uygirs to graze their
animals on the area around Daxihaizi Reservoir. Herdsmen were able to graze on State Farm
Land prior to 1980.

Downstream of Daxihaizi Reservoir, outside of the State Farm areas of No. 34 and 35 Corps,
the only restrictions on irrigated crop cultivation are the need to obtain the County Land
Management Bureau permission and a lack of water. Similarly, for grazing a herdsman must
belong to a local village and pay a fee to the Tarim Township, if in Yuli County, or Rouqiang
if in Rouqiang Township County.          Water is a significant factor in the degraded LGC
rangelands and lack of stock water.

Grassland in the whole Yuli County was 11 X lo6 MU in 1983, 3.5 x lo6 MU in 1989 and
3.06 x ~ O ~ M U in 1994.

The Government plans to move the remaining herdsmen (50 families) from the LGC prior to
2002. In the last 10years the Government has moved 500 to 600 households.

In the early 1990's the County developed more than 14,000 mu for pasture for relocated LGC
herdsmen, but it was used for cotton in the hope of making more money.

Pasture land is destroyed by digging of herb A herb factory in Yuli requires 1,500 - 2,000
herb-grass roots per year. This is a major pressure on pasture land in the LGC, as it is possible
to make RMB % 20lday collecting and selling these herbs. The factory employs 500 workers.
In 1988, Yuli County planted an area of herbs, but this was converted to cotton, hence the
pressure remains.


4.2 IRRIGATION LAND RECLAMATION FOR IRRIGATION
There are about 25,000 ha of developed irrigable land, of which perhaps 13,000 ha is planted
in any one year. Reclamation for irrigation is restricted to the State Farms in this area and

therefore there are no diversions from the Tarim River in the LGC apart from the State Farms.
Current water use by the State Farms in the LGC is about 550 - 600 x 10%~. About half of
this is bought from the Kongque River.

Prior to the 1970's the herdsmen also conducted some irrigation. Apparently the soil is very
good for cropping, in part due to the relatively low salinity (compared to areas upstream of the
LGC).

Just upstream of Qiala Reservoir (i.e. upstream of the LGC) there are a number of private
pumps. These are operated by private investors who pay Yuli County and Tarim Township
for the right to reclaim and irrigate these lands. Downstream of Daxihaizi Reservoir, outside
of the State Farm areas of No. 34 and 35 Corps, the only restrictions on irrigated crop
cultivation are the need to obtain the County Land Management Bureau permission and a lack
of water. The latter is insurmountable, however, as the State Farms own an operate the
reservoirs and have the capacity divert all the residual flows that escape upstream irrigation
diversions and losses.

The extent to which the control of structures drives water management decisions, is reflected
in the TBMB's proposal to construct a canal around Daxihaizi Reservoir to overcome the
potential lack of cooperation by the State Farms in making downstream environmental flow
releases.   The more logical solution is to gain agreement on the reservoir operating
procedures, to match incoming flows and total release requirements;                to meet both
environmental and irrigation needs.


4.3 FORESTRY AND FIREWOOD
Firewood is now only (legally) collected from dead twigs and sticks. Cutting of live trees is
now not allowed. The XPCC pays RMB 50 - 100 Yuanlyear to each person in the State Farm
areas so that they can buy legally cut fuel, rather than cut the Poplar Diversifolia trees and Red
Willow.

There is 990,000 MU of PD trees, along the 490 krn of the LGC, of which about 213 are dying.
Yuli Forest Bureau recently established a PD Tree Station (four staff) to protect the forest and
maintain a PD nursery and plantation. Yuli County has a budget of RMB 500,000 to plant
trees in the whole County in 1999. The County planted 27,000 MU of forest in 1998.

Trees are planted along most of the secondary and tertiary canals, with further plantings in
towns where ever water can be delivered and in small strips within the irrigated areas. There
are no large plantations.


4.4 CONSERVATION OF NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS
There are no reserves in the LGC. Apart from the recent Water Allocation Agreement, there
are no other specific measures to maintain or restore the LGC's ecosystems. China is a
signatory to the Ramsar "International Agreement on Wetland Habitat, Especially for
Migratory Waterbirds" and the "China Australia Migratory Bird Agreement" (CAMBA).
Both of these agreements are relevant to the LGC due.to the natural and artificial wetland
habitats.

Consideration needs to be given to the control of various land management activities that may
                                                                                                   .
be reintroduced on re-establishment of river flows. One or more reserves similar to the poplar
diversifolia reserve in the middle GC may be appropriate, particularly as places for
benchmarking ecological condition.

5. SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

5.1 DEMOGRAPHICS
About 400 households, 2,000 people were living along the LGC in the 1950s (the figures need
to be reconfirmed). The herdsmen grazing between Qiala to Daxihaizi, were moved to Tarim
Township, settled in the 100,000 mu of cultivated land developed by the State Farms. The
farms then moved to the herdsmen' home land.           More than 500,000 mu of land were
reclaimed since, some were given up later because the drying up of the Tarim River. The
population of the six State Farms, No. 31 to 36, is about 40,500. In the 1960's, there were
about 15 hamlets in the Yinsu area. They were engaged in both agriculture and animal
husbandry. There are now only 30 households left.       Since the water began to dry up in the
1970's, people began to move to Rouquiang (the last flood was in 1982). Since the 1990s
Government began to move people to irrigated land near Ruoqiang and gave about 4 mu each.
Six families could not adapt and moved back, only to move again later. One family moved up
to four times.


5.2 HEALTH AND BIRTH CONTROL
Each family has dug a well which are 6 to 10m deep. These are their only water source.

The few herdsmedwomen the project team met seemed in good health. When they got
seriously sick, according to the interviewed herdsmen, they could hardly afford to see the
doctors at the State Farm clinic which is located about 30 km away. The deposit for check-in
the hospital is over 1,000 yuan. Unlike the farmers living in villages, the herdsmen received
very little assistance or education in birth planning until three years ago. According to
Government policy, numbers of children should be restricted, but are more generous than for
city dwelling Han people. The two families interviewed have seven and eight children each
the youngest of whom was eight.


5.3 EDUCATION AND TRAINING
A primary school was established in Yinsu with the assistance of Rouqiang County in 1982.
Since that time, almost all the children of school age went to school for 6 years. However, the
school closed in 1994 when most the herdsmen were moved away. Now about half of the
children go to the schools near the County while the rest don't go to school at all.

It is very difficult for the young herdsmen to remain in LGC to get married because no girls
would like to come to settle down in such a harsh conditions.


5.4 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

Life was comparatively easy for herders until 1970s. They sowed wheat on the land after
flood and were self-efficient in grain supply. There was no need to plough and the soil was
rich. The herdsmen were perhaps more well-off than current farmers in the area. The
economic situation was not too bad until the last flood in 1982. The trees and grass survived
until 1992, about 10 years afier the flood. Since then, corresponding to the deterioration of
the environment, the herdsmen are struggling to survive and the situation is becoming worse
every year.

The goats raised by herders are lean and can not be sold for a good price. In addition to the
goats they keep for their own needs, they have to keep the same number of the State Farm's
flock. The only income from the goats was the fine wool, which they sold for RMB 1,400

Yuan last year, but after tax they received just RMB 130 Yuan. The taxes include the pasture
management fee and the water management fee. They believe the levies are not fair because
the government did not provide them with water or managed the grassland. The tax was
calculated according the numbers of animals, at five yuan per head. One family interviewed
lived on the salary of one son who worked for the high way maintenance team and the sale of
camels. He earns IWIB 200 Yuan a month. One camel can be sold for over RMB 1000 Yuan.


5.5 ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT
Administratively, the 30 remaining households belong to Yinsu Animal Husbandry Team of
Tiganlike Township, Rouqiang County. Another 20 households are scattered from Qiala to
Daxihaizi belong to Tarim Township of Yuli County. The herdsmen in Yinsu are strictly
forbidden to graze their animals across the county boundary.

Most the herdsmen do not own the animals they graze. They either graze for the village
collective, the township or their friends or relatives. The household we interviewed graze 150
goats for the township. They are required to keep the same number of animals each year,
otherwise they have to a pay penalty.

According to the Prefecture's "Herdsmen Resettlement Scheme", all herdsmen need to be
settled with the assistance of the county they belong to, before the year of 2001. The township
is supposed to provide the herdsmen with housing, goat shelters and arable land. The
herdsmen family needs to pay 30% of the cost of the house.            The resettled herdsmen's
households, in Tarim Township we interviewed, received land, but they paid for the house
themselves. They owe the Township 23,000 yuan because the goats they used to raise were
contracted from the Township and now 213 have died because the pasture has gone.

All State Farms No.s 31 to 35 in the LGC belong to Division I1 of the Xinjiang Production
and Construction Corps (XPCC). Each State Farm has a number of Branches, which are in
different locations. Each Branch has a number of Cadres. A Branch of State Farm No. 34
downstream of Alegan was abandoned over 10 years ago due to lack of water.



6. FLORAAND FAUNA OBSERVATIONS
Appendix A lists the species of wild birds and animals observed in the Tarim River Basin,
whilst Appendix B lists the natural and planted tree and shrub species. Appendix C lists those
animal species (mammals, birds and fish) that are protected in Bayingol Prefecture. There are
no records specific to the LGC for any species or group.

Whilst the habitats of the LGC are not unique compared to habitats provided by the middle
and upper GCs, there are (now) fewer people in the LGC, as indicated by the population
statistics for Yuli and Ruoqiang in Table 5.

Table 5:     Land Area (km2), Population and Population Density (Nos.Ikm2)

These data provide a crude indication of the potential disturbance to wildlife in each area.
Yuli County covers the upper portion of the LGC to just upstream of Yinsu, whilst Rouqiang
County covers the lower portion. It is clear that the low population density offers some
sanctuary to wildlife and their habitat, due to the lower level of human activity associated with
the smaller and less dense populations in these two counties. Against this immediate security
from land management actions and hunting, is the disadvantage of being at the lower end of
the river and therefore subject to all water quality and river flow changes caused by upstream
land and water management.

Qiala and Daxihaizi Reservoirs and the Tarim River are stocked with introduced fish species,
the native species having become locally extinct, or near extinct, in the Tarim River. All
species that exist are therefore introduced and are mainly various species of carp. The rarest
of the native species, the big-head fish (Aspiorhynchus laticeps), is classified as "protected"
(Appendix C). Only one or two have been caught anywhere in the Tarim River in the past
five years.


7. RESTORATION REQUIREMENTS

7.1 DEFINING "RESTORATION"
There are a number of steps in moving from the current situation to a fully restored LGC.
These are discussed in the sections below. Restoration to each level will require a greater
allocation of water to the environment and perhaps, additional management andlor structural
measures. Each level will have correspondingly higher opportunity cost, principally because
of the additional water use. Where the restoration measures involve significant financial
resources, there will also be a capital (financial) opportunity cost.       The most degraded
functional areas will require restoration to start with the lowest level. Less degraded areas
may require fewer stages as they have higher level of residual ecosystem condition.


7.2 ENVIRONMENTAL WATER NEEDS

Maintenance of Remaining Trees in Good Health:

Requires annual flooding of at least 14 days and groundwater levels < 6 m deep at the
beginning of spring.

Establishment of New Trees:

Requires an above average flood to achieve 30 days flooding and probably groundwater levels
<3 - 4 m deep at the beginning of the following spring (project estimate) so that groundwater
levels can help sustain tree growth following the annual flood. Such conditions are only
required once or twice every 10 years or so.

Establishment of New Trees and Restorationof Grazing Pastures:

A minimum of 14 days flooding is required annually to maintain a minimum level of pasture
with perhaps only the 6 species of grass, but a month or longer is necessary for good pasture
growth and the full range of up to 28 grass species. It is likely that many of the more palatable
species have the higher water requirements.


7.3 SETTING MEASURABLE GOALS
The Tarim Basin I1 project has as one of its major goals, the rehabilitation of the natural
ecosystem of the LGC, however, to date this goal has not been adequately defined for

management purposes. There is no documentation that records specifically and quantitatively,
even in the broadest sense, what components of the ecosystem are to be restored and to what
level of health.

The current objective remains a general mission statement, i.e. "to save the green corridor".
For this to be achieved, there must be agreement on what the "green corridor" was like prior
to large scale water use upstream. This description must be quantified in terms of extent,
types of habitat and the health of that habitat. It should also describe the wildlife, birds, fish
and other fauna that inhabited the area.

The next requirement is to understand the linkages between the biological components of the
ecosystem and the hydrological and physical components. This is necessary to quantify the
amount of water and land use management changes that are required to achieve each level of
restoration. The main LGC Report includes some system diagrams (Figure 5) that begin this
process.


7.4 CURRENT PERCEPTIONS

There is a wide spread view within agencies and other stakeholders in the Tarim Basin, that
the green corridor, including the LGC, is wasteful of water and that "water resources have low
ecological benefit" (page 3, "The Economic Research Institute of Xinjiang Social Academy
and Xinjiang Executive Office of the World Bank Loan Project", 1997). This is not the case.

If the original estimated average annual inflow to the Tarim River at Aler, of 100 - 120 x lo8
m3 is averaged over the total area of the green corridor downstream of Aler, it gives an
average water consumption of 4,500 m3/ha (300 m3/mu) (see Annex 3). This about half that
of current irrigation use.


7.5 WHAT CAN BE DONE?
Annex 3 addresses the extent to which water can be used to restore the LGC. Various
assumptions have to be made, based on little information, to make these predictions.
Monitoring will be required to confirm these relationships and to monitor the success of any
environmental flow allocations. If an average annual allocation of 300 x lo6 m3 was made
available and assuming the above unit area efficiency, then about 24% of the original LGC
habitat could be restored.



8. CONCLUSIONS
1. The ecosystems of the LGC are highly degraded downstream of Daxihaizi Reservoir. The
    habitat can be restored if sufficient flows are made available. Whether the original animal
    species are locally extinct can not be determined due to lack of data. Therefore it can not
    be established to extent the fauna will recover given the partial or complete restoration of
    habitat.

2. There is insufficient information on which to establish the success or otherwise of any
    restoration measures into the future.

3. Water from the Tarim          Kongque Rivers is the key requirement for the maintenance of
    the existing relic habitats. Both sources will be key to the restoration of additional habitat,
    especially the major wetland habitats of Luoluluke and Aksupu Swamps. The latter has
    not been considered part of the LGC in the past, but its restoration is integral to the

  restoration of the LGC, both as habitat and as a conduit for surface and groundwater to the
  LGC.

4. The habitats of the LGC are, by and large, not unique when compared to the upper and
   middle GC of the Tarim River. However, there are large areas of habitat, including about
   % of the total poplar diversifolia forest prior to degradation and the large wetland area of
   Aksupu Swamp, a separate, but integral component of the LGC's hydrology and habitat.
   For these considerations alone, it is worth while attempting the restoration of at least the
   upper portion of the LGC.

5. Due to the limitations of water management and structural measures, any attempt to
   restore the LGC will extend down a considerable part of its length and result in a new
   location of the ecotone along the transition from riverine to desert habitat. Structural
   measures should be aimed at maximising the area of the LGC that is towards the wetter
   end of this ecotone, as the drier areas are already well represented given the impacts of
   human water use. They should not be aimed at trying to spread the water as far as
   possible; that would result in salinisation and habitat of limited value to wildlife and fish.



9. RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Develop "system diagrams" and conceptual models of key interactions between river
   flows, habitat and wildlife, both direct and indirect. These will provide the tools by which
   to predict the success of various restoration measures.

2. Establish realistic and measurable goals for environmental restoration in each reach of the
   LGC and through and with all key stakeholders. Document these goals and the data needs
   for effective management. These data are to made freely available to all relevant parties.

3. Establish environmental monitoring in accordance with the "Monitoring Framework"
   outlined in Section 6.4.2 of the main LGC Report.

4. Undertake special wildlife surveys of the upper, middle and lower GCs to determine the
   relative wildlife species compositions and abundances. These studies should be conducted
   at similar times of year and/or similar times with respect to the summer flood season.
   Location, habitat, dates and flooding conditions should be recorded for all observations, in
   addition to the normal biological data.

5. Utilise voluntary bird watching organisations, such as "Birdlife International" or the "The
   British Trust for Ornithology" (see section 11) to monitor birds in initially, particularly
   migratory species in autumn and spring to determine numbers by species, habitat
   preferences, timing, breeding, direction of movement and other ecological information.
   Costs only would need to be covered, making this a cheap means of augmenting busy
   agency staff. It would also send a positive message to the international community of the
   achievements in saving the LGC.

6. Store all data in computerised relational databases that can be queried by field (parameter)
   and also linked to spatial records of wildlife observations in a Geographic Information
   System (GIs). As indicated in Annex 6, spatial modelling techniques will be important in
   investigating links between flood extent and duration, with ecological condition.

7. Utilise remote sensing data, in particular satellite imagery, to record the condition and type
   of habitats throughout the GC. This will be a very cost effective means of recording the

   success of restoration efforts and comparing the areas and types of habitat available in the
   LGC to elsewhere. Use of quantification techniques, available though digital analysis of
   satellite imagery, will enable direct comparison of multi-temporal data. Such measures
   include indices such as the Normalised Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) that record the
   amount of photosynthetic leaf area, i.e. growing vegetation, and remove all other
   differences between the images taken of the same area but on different dates.

8. Modify initial restoration measures, both structural and non-structural, based on
   monitoring data, to improve the achievement of the established environmental goals.
   Where necessary, modify those goals to make them more realistic and achievable, but only
   though the involvement of all stakeholders and with the coordination of the TBWRC.

9. Undertake the "Recommended Research Program", outlined in Section 8.2 of the main
   LGC Report.

FIELD TRIP ITINERARY

Tuesday 6April:

Travelled from Korla to Yuli, then to Qiala and Daxihaizi Reservoir. Stayed at the Ti Gan Li
Ke Hostel at XPCC No. 34 Corps about 15 km east of Daxihaizi Reservoir. The 34thCorps
has 8,000 members who work 80,000 MU.

Wednesday 7April:

Continued to Yinsu, about 40 km south east of Daxihaizi Reservoir. Returned to Korla via
the same route.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:

    The whole area is in Bayingol Prefecture, Yuli County.

    The road is in poor condition from about 5 km south of Yuli. Only 25 kmhr can be
    averaged on the dirt road in a bus, whilst a 4WD can average perhaps 40 kmhr at the
    most.   This road is a major impediment to the movement of labour, materials and
    agricultural produce.

    There are 5 State Farms: XPCC No. 31, 32, 33, 34 & 35. The last two are downstream of
    Daxihaizi Reservoir.

    Yinsu is at the 930 km road mark, Qiala Reservoir at the 790 krn mark.

    The Lower Green Corridor (LGC) has been divided into three reaches by previous
    workers:

  3   Qiala to Daxihaizi

  3   Daxihaizi to Yinsu

  3   Yinsu to Taitema Lake

     This subdivision corresponds to the prevailing hydrologic and ecological conditions. The
     three sub-reaches or sections can be referred to as the upper, middle and lower LGC.




Appendix D                                                                               1

GEOMORPHOLOGY:

  Between Yinbazar and Qiala the river has many floodplain channels and the Green
  Corridor is wide. Qiala Reservoir is located at the point where the river regains a single
  channel. It appears that this :nay be due to a major structural (bedrock) control underlying
  the alluvial sediments in the vicinity of Qiala. The LGC is very narrow at this point, being
  less than 3 km wide adjacent to the reservoir. The north-eastern side of the reservoir is
  formed by the sand dunes of the Kuluk Desert. The dunes of the Taklimakan Desert are
  easily visible across the largely treeless LGC on the south west side.

  The river channel has a capacity of about 120 m3/s at Qiala according to Mr. Hu Wei
  Dong.     This reduces to about 30 m3/s at Yinsu.         In part this is due to the steeper
  longitudinal slope and relatively straight channel at Qiala (as noted by Mr. Lai) as well as
  the larger cross-section. At Qiala the cross-section is relatively rectangular and about 50
  m x 2 m compared to the more triangular cross-section at Yinsu, where the bed is 2 to 4 m
  wide x 5 m deep and 20 m between the top of banks. The high sinuosity and short
  wavelength of the meanders at Yinsu indicates a slower velocity.

  The conclusion that there is shallow bedrock at, and upstream of, Qiala Reservoir is in part
  due to the above noted channel characteristics, but also due to the evident high water
  tables. This is reflected in the relatively good condition of floodplain shrubs and reeds,
  and in the presence of occasional groups of poplar diversiflora trees on sand dunes on the
  edge of the desert. Advice from the Bayingol Forestry Bureau is that once groundwater
  levels fall below 10 m, tree condition suffers and ultimately ends in death. Evidently
  therefore, the young, healthy PD trees on the top of dunes 6 m high must have regular
  access to groundwater well within 4 m of the surface of the floodplain. Indeed some water
  was observed in depressions and excavations within 1to 2 m depth.

  The ephemeral lakes between the dunes in on the south-western edge of the LGC may also
  be indicative of high groundwater levels. These lakes are opposite and downstream of
  Qiala Reservoir. The closest and largest are, or were, probably fed by surface flows as
  well, but the more distant ones could only be groundwater fed, if indeed they are lakes, as
  is suggested from the water and vegetation response in MSS satellite imagery.

  Groundwater levels may by supported, in part, by the south-eastern movement of
  groundwater from Aksupu swamp, an area that is mainly fed by Kongque River flows.
  Apparently that area is not as healthy as it once was.

HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY:

Qiala Reservoir

  Capacity is 140 x lo6m3. Maximum depth when full is 4 m, whilst the average depth is 1
  - 2 m. It dries up in some years. March is generally the lowest month.

  Most water is supplied from the Kongque River via a constructed channel. This channel
  discharges water directly into the top end of Qiala Reservoir. It costs the State Farms
   RMB Y 0.0024/m3 to purchase this water from the Bayingol Prefecture Government
   (?Baying01 Water Resource Bureau).

   Water can only be diverted from the Tarim River during flood flows, otherwise there is
   insufficient head, as there is no weir across the Tarim to assist gravity diversion.

   All five State Farms (Corps of the XPCC) are supplied from Qiala Reservoir. No. 31, 32
   & 33 Corps are supplied from the channel between Qiala and Daxihaizi Reservoirs. This


Appendix D                                                                               2

  channel has a capacity of 100 m3/sand water takes 3 to 5 days to travel the distance. The
  transfer efficiency is 0.8 - 0.9, compared to the Tarim River's 0.6.

  The Kuta Main Canal (30 km long) was built in the 1970's. It will be lined as part of
  Tarim 11. It currently goes as far as Aksupu but will be extended to Qiala as part Tarim 11.
  The extension will be called Kuta Dong.

Daxihaizi Reservoir

  We were advised (incorrectly) that Daxihaizi Reservoir occupies a depression on the
  northern floodplain of the Tarim River (it does in fact impound the Tarim River - see
  below). It was built in 1957, however, an extra embankment was built in 1994to increase
  the depth and to limit the surface area. The design capacity is 186 x lo6 m3 and the
  operating volume is 160 x lo6 m3.      ow ever, the normal full capacity is in the order of 80
  to 100 x lo6 m3 and the effective portion of this that can be used in any one year is about
  40 x lo6m3. At the time of inspection it was holding 80 x lo6 m3The maximum depth is
  about 4 m, whilst the average is only 1 to 2 m. Evaporation is >2 rnlyr.

  The salinity of Daxihaizi was about 2.7 g/l at the time of the inspection. In the flood
  season it is about 2.1 g/l. Mineralisation, temperature and perhaps some other parameters
  are regularly monitored.

  We were advised (incorrectly) that the river continues around the reservoir, enabling flows
  to bypass it at times. It appears that all flows up to a certain discharge will enter the
  reservoir by gravity diversion via a canal, above which the remainder will continue pass
  the reservoir in the river. The latter situation rarely if ever occurs now. Apparently, it
  takes an average annual flow of > 35 m3/sat Daxihaizi for this to occur (i.e. 1.1 x lo9m3).
  Hu. In any case, we were advised, most flows now enter the reservoir from the Qiala
  Canal. However this is not the case either, as Qiala Canal is that canal which takes water
  from the Tarim River at Qiala and feds the State Farm areas. Even the Qiala Release
  Canal does not reach Daxihaizi Reservoir, but joins Qiala Canal.

   The above information about the location of the reservoir is incorrect, as can be clearly
   seen on satellite and aerial imagery in the TBMB office. The river & impounded by
   Daxihaizi Reservoir as all involved parties should know.

  The TBMB is working with the XPCC to achieve some flooding downstream of Daxihaizi
  Reservoir. To date this was successhl in 1995 when 28 x lo6 m3 was released over 18
  days at 12 m3/s. This water just reached "The Miller's Place", about 2 km upstream of
  Yinsu. There was no overbank flow.

  The last "natural" flow to reach Yinsu was in 1991, however whilst leading to the
   germination of some PD trees in the channel, it did not go overbank and assist the trees on
  the floodplain. The last flood was in the early 1980's.

   About 20,000 people live in the Daxihaizi area and work 50,000 MU of agricultural land
   commanded by the reservoir. In the past two years about 300,000 MU has been planted,
   including the tree plantings.

   The priority of water allocation is forestry then agriculture. Trees include fruit trees and
   shelter belts, there are no plantations as such. Trees require about 700 m3/h4u/y-, whilst
   agriculture requires 600 - 700 m3/'M~lyr.There are about 120,000 MU of trees. Fruit
   trees include apples, pears, dates, peaches and apricots.



Appendix D

HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND LANDUSE:

  The only settlements are associated with the reservoirs and the State Farms. There are few
  herdsmen away from the settlements as they are no longer nomadic, but are settled and
  grow irrigated pasture for their animals.

  There is some unplanned development along the LGC using water pumped from the Tarim
  Riverjust upstream of Qiala Reservoir.

  Grazing values for herdsmen have deteriorated to the extent that there is no one
  downstream of Yinsu. At Yinsu the last few herdsmen only come in winter. Water in the
  village well is about 6 m or more below the surface in the bottom of an old channel of the
  Tarim River.

  There are about 50,000 people in the State Farms (XPCC).              The Yuli XPCC was
  established in 1958. The original settlers are now mostly retired and the second generation
  are now the workers. More workers are being encouraged to join the Corps. This is
  primarily to support the aging population.

  The XPCC has developed about 100,000 MU for irrigation near Tarim Township (outside
  of the LGC) which it has handed over to herdsmen. There are about 2000 herders, with
  100 to 200 animals per family. The animals graze the river areas, not the farm land.

  Living and agricultural conditions are poor. In some years crops need to be planted three
  times, resulting in more water use.

  In years when no water reaches Daxihaizi, the Government pays people so that they do not
  move away (eg. 1993). In those years only 30,000 MU is planted.

  The XPCC plants both poplar diversifolia and grey popular as shelter belts around
  agricultural areas and settlements.

  Mr. Abdullla noted that Yuli County if half agriculture and half grazing. 250,000 cattle
  are grazed within the LGC; there are none grazed outside it.

  In the 1980's the quantity and quality of the grazing lands deteriorated with the decrease in
  water. Of the 28 species of palatable grasses originally present, only 5 to 6 remain.
  Consequently, the herdsmen have no choice to but to settle permanently and irrigate grass
  for their stock. It was noted that new reed growth (Phagmites sp.) offers good grazing;
  old growth, apparently not.

  The natural pastures of the LGC are more dependent on volume than duration, as this is
  what establishes the extent of flooding and therefore the extent of pasture. However, the
  duration is also important as a minimum of 15 to 20 days flooding is required for good
  grass growth.


ECOLOGY:

  RMB Y 50 - 100 is paid to each person in the LGC by the XPCC to prevent poplar and red
  willow cutting for hel.
  There are few wild animals, apparently due to the deterioration in pasture. Only wild
  hares were noted.

  Mr. Lai noted that the lack of trees near Qiala is due to the lack of overbank flows, both
  prior to water development and since. Flood waters are needed to distribute and germinate
  the seeds. A minimum of two weeks of shallow flooding is required for germination.

  Tree cutting is responsible for the lack of trees in other areas. In the 1 9 5 0 ' ~the main

  areas of reclamation were within treed areas of the LGC. This practice has been stopped
  and now the trees are protected as much as possible. People now respect and value the
  trees for the protection against the desert sands and wind storms.

  Established trees can survive up to 10 years without flooding. When a tree is punctured
  (for instance by a growth-ring corer), the water can flow horizontally up to one metre.
  This is taken as an indication of the very strong water pressure within the tree bringing
  water up from the roots. It may also be due to the hydraulic head of passive water stores
  within the trees'.

  A type of caterpillar eats the leaves of PD. Previous reports were that this caterpillar
  ("worm") is now worse in areas receiving little or no water.

  The overall condition of the LGC between Qiala and Daxihaizi is moderately good
  considering the changes in water availability.        Pasture condition and lack of tree
  establishment are undoubtedly the most visible signs of deterioration. Existing trees
  appear quite healthy, probably because groundwater levels are still being supported to
  some degree by the losses from the canals, river and irrigated areas.

  Between Daxihaizi and Yinsu, the situation deteriorates rapidly. There is no pasture or
  even thorny "Bell Bushes" in most areas. There are no new trees. Areas of wind erosion
  are evident in treed parts of the corridor right up to the Tarim River. The Tarim as no
  aquatic vegetation in it. It is a dry dusty depression indistinguishable from the rest of the
  corridor apart from its depth.

  Downstream of Yinsu was not inspected. However, reports are that live trees extend to
  Alegan, but not much further and those trees are dying or dead.

SATURDAY 3 APRIL:             Korla to Xaya County (Aksu Prefecture)

   Lunch was taken at Kuqa (pronounced "Kuche") the second largest town in Aksu
   Prefecture. It is over an hour's drive from there to the river through the Xayar Irrigation
   District (pronounced "ShayaV)whichis supplied from the Weigan River, as are two other
   irrigation areas. There is a gradual fall towards the Tarim River in the form of a large fan.
   The slope is only noticeable from the direction of supply channels, drains and the levelled
   irrigation plots. As the Tarim River is approached the water supply is from that river.

   Spent the night at Xayar town in a comfortable hotel. Dinner was hosted by Mr. Hua,
   Director of the Xaya County Hydrographic Division and Mr. Shi (Deputy Director).

Xinqiman Hydrographic Station on the Tarim River

General Description.

   Visited Xinqiman Hydrographic Station office and accommodation compound, which is
   about 1 km from the river - locked at the time of our visit with no one present. The
   County has recently constructed a major drainage channel past the Station. This has
   caused the Station's well to become unusable due to an increase in the salinity. The
   officers, who are stationed there on rotation for 1 to 3 months at a time, now have to get
   water from the river or elsewhere. The staff are from the Aksu Prefecture Hydrographic
   Division Office. Mr. Wang Fu Yong used to be one of the officers some time ago before
  joining the TBMB.

   General drainage water salinity is in the order of 3 to 4 g/l (ie. 3000 to 4000 mg/l). Mr.
   Do advised that data from representative periods over the past 30 years can be provided.
   He estimated the volume of drainage water from the whole Weigan River area to be about
   10 m3/s.

Hydroloay, Geomorphology and Water Quality:

   The reach at Xinqiman is the straightest and narrowest in this section of the river. This is
   why it was chosen for the bridge and gauging station.

   The gauged section is about 1 krn upstream of a pontoon bridge over the river, which is
   directly south of the Hydrographic Station. The river's dimensions at the bridge are
   approximately 600 to 800 m wide between top of banks and 2 m from the top of the left
   bank to the water level. The low flow channel was about 60 m wide by 0.5 to 1.0 m deep




Appendix E                                                                                1

  maximum and is against the left bank (looking downstream). Discharge was 20 m3/s and
  salinity about 3 to 4 g/l.

  The 1994 flood was 1,700 m3/s(146,900 ML/D)- which was perhaps the largest.on record
  according to Mr. Shi (the Deputy Director of the Xaya County Hydrographic Division).
  The 1998 flood was 1,240 m3/s(107,100 MLD).

  Discharge at bank full is 700 to 800 m3/s (60,000 to 70,000 MLD). Prior to 5 to 6 years
  ago it was about 1,500 m3/s. The decrease is due to about 1 m of sedimkntation in the bed
  of the river according to Mr. Wang Fu Yong.

  Mr. Wang Fu Yong says that the river is moving towards the left bank and has
  significantly reduced the distance between the river and the Hydrographic Station.

  The river is gauged every day in the flood season (i.e. July, August, September) and every
   15 days over the remainder of the year, as the Station is a "National Level Basic Station".
  A boat is attached to the cable way that is slung from two towers on either bank. No
  mention was made of how overbank flows are measured.

  Other data that are ?sometimes collected include mineralisation, clarity, suspended
  sediment, pH, temperature,.... These samples are taken by special staff from the Water
  Quality Monitoring Centre of the Aksu Prefecture Hydrologic Station.

Ecology;

  There are no recorded data on ecological parameters for this Station.

  Big Head Fish have "Level 2 Protectionyyunder a National law. Herdsmen have seen them
   in the past tsvo years and even filed a suit in one case where a structure being built by an
   agency was going to block the fish's access to breeding areas. It would appear that the
   breeding areas might be lakes and flooded areas of the Green Corridor.

   There used to be three species of fish; Big Head Fish (the only remaining species and then
   only in small numbers), an "easily caught fish" achieving lengths over 0.6 m, and a "red
   fish". Shrimps can still be caught and some small fish about 60 mm long were observed at
   the edge of the river.

   Terrestrial animals observed in this reach of the Green Corridor include wild pigs and
   hares.   There were few tracks of insects in the sand and none of reptiles or small
   mammals, such as rodents. Whilst it is early in the season, none of these animals were
   mentioned by the people present.

   The Diversified poplar (DP) forest is less than 1 krn wide on the left bank and of
   indeterminate width on the right bank. Large areas of trees on both banks have been
   lopped for fire wood, generally about 2 to 3 m above the ground. Some areas of trees on
   the left bank have been completed cleared, as noted by some of those present, compared to
   previous visits. Harvesting of branches on multiple occasions has lead to moderate sized
   trunks of up to 0.3 m diameter supporting small rounded crowns of many small branches
   only 30 to 50 mm in diameter. Even the un-cut trees are not large. In fact there are few
   trees on the left bank taller than 4 to 5 m. Trees on the right bank are larger, with trunk
   diameters up to 0.6 m and heights up to 8 to 10 m where they have not been lopped.

   There is little understorey apart from young PD trees, of which there are moderate
   numbers. Only a few species of shrubs are present. There are no grasses or other ground
.  cover. Only dead PD leaves cover some of the hollows in the uneven sandy surface. In


Appendix E                                                                                2

   some areas, the fine sand is covered with a darker layer of finer sediment, either indicative
   of lower velocities in the flood season and/or lower levels on the floodplain.


SUNDAY 4 APRIL: Xaya to Korla via Yinbazar (Bayingol Prefecture)

  It is not possible to drive along the river or even through or on the edge of the Green
  Corridor. There are no roads, only rough tracks and is likely that most of these would
  have difficult to negotiate sandy and boggy sections. Therefore it is necessary to back
  track via Xaya to the main Aksu to Korla highway, which is joined at Xinhe. The
  highway is left at Luntai. The first half in to Yinbazar from this direction is on a bumpy
  narrow sealed road, but on joining the new road constructed by the Oil Development
  Agency, it is mostly a fast drive. If coming from the direction of Korla, this oil road can
   be used for its entire length, from where it leaves the highway about half an hour's drive
  out of Korla, to the river (a 2 hour drive). From the river, this road becomes the "Desert
  Highway".

Yinbazar Hydrographic Station on the Tarim River

General Description:

  The Yinbazar Hydrographic Station office and accommodation compound is located in the
  new village of Yinbazar. The village is immediately adjacent to the northern (lee bank)
  abutment of the Tarim River Bridge and has sprung up since the bridge's construction in
   1995 by the Oil Development Agency.

   It appears from maps, satellite imagery and the field inspection, that the Green Corridor is
  much wider at this point than at Xinqiman. This is due to break-outs at and downstream
   of Xinqiman. A major route of these flood waters on the northern bank is crossed about
   15 km north of the river. Further north, about 40 km from the river there are large areas of
   wet saline land, reed beds (Phagmites sp.) and some areas of stunted "red willow"
   (probably not Salix sp.). These areas are probably mostly fed not from the Tarim River,
   but from groundwater and minor surface flows from the irrigation tailwater of the Weigan
   River area and from the mountains to the north. It is possible that some of the floodwaters
   of the Weigan River could also contribute.

   The new road tends to impound and redirect water on the floodplain of both river banks,
   but this is probably not significant on anything but the local scale.

Hydrology, Geomorphology and Water Quality:

   Stream flow data are obtained by the staff of the Bayingol Hydrographic Station under the
   direction of Mr. Chen of the Bayingol TBMB. They use the bridge (600 m long between
   the left and right river banks) to take the gaugings. The frequency of gaugings was not
   asked. No mention was made of how overbank flows are measured.

   Interestingly, the TBMB had written a message on the bridge railing to the effect that "All
   water use from the Tarim River should be in accordance with the requirement to obtain a
   1icence".

   The floodplain displays a greater variation in surface levels than Xinqiman and has areas
   of static and semi mobile dunes on both banks. It is likely that this is due to the lateral
   relocation of the major break outs and associated flood runners. Even the apparently
   higher areas with dunes support apparently healthy PD trees, although no young trees are
   present in those areas.

Ecology:

  The Bayingol Forestry Bureau has established a Protected Forest Area that extends
  downstream from just west of Yinbazar, to about half way to Qiala. The actual boundaries
  provided by the Bayingol Forestry Bureau are 84' 15' to 85' 30' East, 40' 55' to 41' 15'
  North.

  Other data have been collected as part of the Tarim I (?) Project in 1995-96, by the
  Environmental Evaluation and Research Institute of the Xinjiang Academy of Science
  under the direction of Mr. Zhang Fa Cheng. Local staff assisted during these sampling
  occasions, but apparently do not have the skills to undertake them independently. The
  data included water quality parameters, ecological information, amount and direction of
   sand movement and perhaps some other data. This monitoring has been discontinued due
  to lack of funds since the completion of Tarim I.

  The condition of the PD forest was similar to that at Xinqiman in the well watered areas.
  However, the greater variation in surface topography and greater width of the Green
   Corridor, is reflected in a greater diversity of condition and age structure, as noted above.

   The soil of the Green Corridor also reflects the variation in surface level, with higher areas
   being more sandy, to the extent of becoming mobile dunes in some areas. Underlying
   such areas there is a horizontal layer of finer darker material, a "hard pan", which probably
   reflects the original floodplain surface. These hard pan surfaces are visible in many areas
   of the northern edge of the Taklimakan Desert where it extends north of paleo-channels
   that are over 20 krn south of the current river.

   It would appear that none of the areas near the road retain water after the three month
   flood summer season. The areas of reed and red willow, noted above, beyond the northern
   edge of the Green Corridor, would appear to be indicative of more permanently wet
   conditions. Perhaps such conditions are unsuitable for PD trees as they were absent from
   both reeds and thick red willow areas.

   PD trees do no begin to bud until late April or early May. Flowering begins in early April
   with separate male and female trees. The flowers of male trees are red, whilst the female
   trees' are green.
