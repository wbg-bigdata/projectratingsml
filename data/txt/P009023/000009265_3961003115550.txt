MEMORANDUM AND RECOW4ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PAOPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR TH  EASTERN ANATOLIA WATERSHED REHA8ILITATION PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Turkey for US$77 million
equivalent. The proposed loan would have a term of 17 years, including a
five-year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and
would help finance the Eastern Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project. The
project also includes a Global Environment Trust Fund (GET) grant component
(the "GET Subproject") of US$5.1 million equivalent to fund j-_isJt
conservation of genetic diversity in Turkey.
llackgrond
2.       Turkey is self-sufficient in the production of most foods, and
agricultural production has kept pace with population growth through the
1980s. Nevertheless, growth has been lower than could be expected given
Turkey'l resource base and production potentiall yields have stagnated for
some crops, particularly for wheat, which accounts for 40% of cultivated area
and which is the dominant crop over the central and eastern plateaux.
Productivity growth in livestock, which is fed mostly from extensive
rangelands and contributes over 30% of agricultural GDP, has also been low.
3.       Soil degradation from erosion is one of the most serious problems
affecting long-term sustainability of agriculture in Turkey; erosion affects
S7 million hectares, or over 70% of the land area of the country. Unfavorable
natural conditions are aggravated by cultivation practices which do not
observe soil and moisture conservation measures and leave fallow land exposed.
Population pressures have reduced pasture area by more than half over the past
40 years, replacing pasture with low-yielding cereal cultivation on marginal
soils. Remaining pasture land is frequently overgrazed, reducing vegetative
cover, exposing soils and lowering fodder yields. While 25% of the land area
is classified as forest land, 60% of this is degraded by excessive cutting for
fuelwood and fodder and by overgrazing, and is not productive for timber
purposes. Conditions are particularly severe in the mountainous regions of
Eastern and South-Eastern Anatolia, in the upper watershed of the Euphrates
and Tigris rivers.
4.       Turkey is one of the world's most important centers for genetic
resources, with more than 3,000 endemic agricultural and forest species.
Species include several that are relatives of the major crops that feed the
world, such as wheat, barley, chickpeas, lentils, fodder crops, fruit and
forest species. Plant breeders from all over the world come to Turkey to
collect and use strains from wild progenitors, landraces and primitive crop
forms, to develop improved crop varieties. The biodiversity of the regions of
Turkey that are rich in these wild strains is, however, threatened by
overgrazing, deforestation, and modern agriculture.
5.       Government is becoming increasingly concerned with soil erosion and
other onvironmental issues in Turkey. It has become aware that, if soil



conservation issues are to be successfully addressed, a coordinated approach
between the rural service agencies is necessary on range, forest and
agricultural land, And that full and active participation of the local
population in the planning and implementation of programs is essential to
sUcces8. Turkey has a well-staffed agricultural extension and forestry
organization in the provinces and techniques for soil and moisture
conservation have been, in general, well tested in Turkey.
6.       Government requested the assistance of the Bank in financing a
reforestation, range management and.soil and moisture conservation program in
Eastern Turkey in 1990. It was decided to focus project activities on the
three provinces of the middle cacchment of the Upper Euphrates River Basin,
Elazig, N4alatya and Adiyaman, since erosion problems are most severe in those
areat. Because of poor endowment with natural resources, compounded by a
harsh climate, income levels in these areas are also r latively low.
7.       Official. recognized the need to test and develop a workable
approach to participation by the local communities in the project activities.
The approach selected was one based on microcatchment planning and
implementation using the "farmer-centered, problem-census, problem-solving"
technique, which had already been applied in Turkey. Using this method,
villagers define problems and select from a Omenu" of ameliorative treatments
in consultation with extension and forestry staff. It was decided to prepare
six microcatchment plans, sufficient for the first year's implementation,
using this approach before project start-up. This served to train project
staff, to define in detail the first year's activities and to minimize
implementation delays.
S.       The authorities recognize also the importance of conserving Turkey's
biodiversity. At present much plant material is classified and conserved ex-
situ in laboratories. This needs to be supplemented, however, by In-otU
conservation, which allows genetic material to continue to evolve naturally in
its own environment and permits conservation of a largar number of species and
strains. The Turkish authorities have approached the Global Environmental
Trust Fund (GET) for assistance in funding La-uj.j gene conservation for
agricultural and forest species in Turkey. The Regional Vice President has
approved the GET grant for this activity, subject to the approval of the
Eastern Anatolia Watershed Project.
9.       Lossons learnd from Mrevious Bank involvement. Recent reviews of
agricultural projects in Turkey highlight the need for participation of
beneficiaries in project preparation, and for decentralized project
management. Reviews conclude that farmers respond readily to appropriate
technical packages. This is the first Bank-financed Watershed Project for
Turkey. Even in other countries Watershed Rehabilitation projects are
relatively new to the Bank and results to date have been mixeG   Reviews have
emphasized the need for securing support of local communities in planning and
implementation, and simplifying organizational arrangements to ensure close
coordination among participating institutions.
10.      Rationale for lank involvement. The project forms part of the
Bank's country assistance strategy for Turkey, which includes increased focus
on environment and sustainability, and on poorer, less developed regions. By



- 3 -
improving sustainable range, forest and agricultural production, the project
would contribute to higher rural incomes in these areas. Women, who play a
major role in farming in the project area would also benefit frow increased
income opportunities and improved access to fuelwood, water and food.
Concerning the Bank sector development strategy, the project would support the
objective of strengthening the technical support services, with a focus on
coordination between institutions, and on increasing responsiveness of
services to priorities as expressed by farmers. Government agencies have done
substantial work in developing the participatory approach at field level. The
project would build on experience gained in the Agricultural Extension and
Applied Research proje-ts, and on the recently approved Agricultural Research
Project, which includes applied research activities in soil and resource
conservation in Eastern Turkey. The Bank is currently the major agency giving
significant assistance to improve technical services in rural areas, and no
other source of adequate funding is available. The GET subproject is
consistent with GET strategy: protecting Turkey's biodiversity of plant
species is of global importance, while la-p_Uj conservation of wild relatives
of economically important plants is an innovation for Turkey and in the world.
Turkey has a commitment to biodiversity preservation and success in this
endeavor will benefit plant breeders universally.
11.      Pro=eit obiectives.  The project addresses important problems of
rural poverty and natural resource degradation. It would restore fertility to
badly degraded soils and reduce erosion in upland areas in three low income
provinces in Eastern Turkey, using existing resources more effectively and
safeguarding the productive base of the area. It would strengthen farmers'
planning and implementing capacity and increase incomes through improving
fuelwood, fodder and agricultural production. The project would also
strengthen the capacity of the provincial rural services to provide technical
support to farmers in a coordinated and responsive way. The GET subproject
would establish conservation areas for the protection of genetic resources of
the wild relatives of globally significant herbaceous and woody species
originating in Turkey and would build up the institutional capacity to sustain
this protection.
12.      Project desorintion.  The project would support watershed
rehabilitation activities in about 54 microcatobments over a seven-year
period. An integrated microcatchment planning approach would be used, and
treatments would be selected and implemented with the active participation of
the local populations. They would includes on agricultural land, promotion of
food and forage legumes, soil conservation tillage, conversion of marginal
cereal land to forage banks, improved crop husbandry and horticulture; on
zsnao gnd, improved management by communities and range enrichment; on forest
Ian, oak and fuelwood coppice rehabilitation, soil conservation
afforestation, conifer plantations and gully revegetation with multipurpose
species. The project would finance agg=L= activitLes aimed at providing
income gains in the short to medium-term, including soil conservation on
dryland farms, small-scale irrigation, beekeeping, genetic improvement of
livestock, agro-forestry and fruit trees. It would strengthen field services
to undertake these activities. With a view to longer-term sustainability, it
would also support adaptive research into alternative soil and moisture
conservation methods, pilot aerial seeding of rangeland, community management



- 4 -
of forests and other activities. It would provide financial support to
project planning and monitoring, training and technical assistance. The
proposed GET subproject would support survey and inventories of in-Bl=t
conservation areas, establishment and management of JZ-1itu gene management
zones, data management, conservation strategies, institutional support,
monitoring and training. The subproject components are described in more
detail in the Xemorandum of the Director (MOD), dated February 9, 1993
(Report No. 11295-TU).
13.      The Watershed Rehabilitation Project would be executed over a seven-
year period. It would includes works, consisting of minor irrigation, and
reforestation activities (52% of project costs), plant and equipment and its
use for rehabilitation activities (8%), beehives and related equipment (4%),
field vehicles (5%), materials, especially seedlings, acorns, seed and
fertilizer (18%), technical assistance and training (6%), incremental
operating costs (6%) and the PPF (1%).
14.      The Watershed Rehabilitation Project has an estimated total cost of
US$109.8 million euivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$36
million (33%). The proposed Bank loan of US$77 million would finance about
70% of projecit costs. Schedule A shows a breakdown of costs and the financing
plan, while S3chedule B indicates methods of procurement and disbursement and
the disburatment schedule.  The GET subproject would have a total cost of
US$5.7 million equivalent. A timetable of key processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Turkey are given in Schedule C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 11294-TU dated February 9, 1993,
and Memorandum of the Director and Grant Agreement covering the GET Subproject
Report No. 11295-TU dated February 9, 1993 are being distributed separately.
5.-       Pe  es     emena -   The project would be executed by the
provincial departments of the Ministries of ForestryO and Agriculture and
Rural Affairs?/ with the participation of the local population through the
preparation and implementation of detailed microcatcbment plans. The
provincial organizations have already formed provincial project implementation
units and microcatchment (MC) planning tems. The Ministry of Forestry would
coordinate, and would have final responsibility for the scope of the plans.
The project would be supported at central level by a Project Coordination and
Support Unit (PCSU) within the Ministry of Forestry, working closely with
designated officials in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairo. The
PCSU would have responsibility for approval of plans and budget allocation,
monitoring, training, and recruitment of technical assistance, procurement,
diabursement and project accounts. An interministerial National Steering
Committee would provide overall guidance. The GET subproject would be
implemented by the respective central and regional research organizations of
the Ministries of Forestry, and Agriculture and Rural Affairs, while its

16.      Sustainab±lity of the project will depend in large part on the
commitment of the Government, on continued involvement of local populations
and on the demonstrated viability of the proposed interventions. Government
is increasingly concerned with sustained management of Turkey's natural
resource base. Government participated actively in the project preparation
process and has nominated staff to the coordination unit. Preparation of
microcatchment plans by the provincial authorities and local populations is
underway with the assistance of a PPF. Research activities are expected to
strengthen the technical base for sustainability.
17.      Aareed actions. GOT has prepared, as the principal condition for
negotiations, 6 microcatchmen* plans, sufficient for the first year's project
implementation, and their form and content have been agreed with the Bank. At
negotiations, GOT agreed to (a) the arrangements for project organization and
management, and provided evidence that key staff had been nominated (the
central project steering committee, coordination unit and provincial project
implementation unlts have already been established); (b) make adequate
budgetary provisions to implement the project and provided evidence that
sufficient budget allocations to meet GOT's contribution to the project had
been made for the FY93 budget; (c) the procurement arrangements; (d) open a
Special Account; (e) Arrange an Implementation Review by July 31, 1995; (f)
sign the major Technical Assistance contract by October 1, 1993; (g) review
annually with the World Bank the content of the microcatchment plans for the
following season, and agree annually on modifications to the MC planning
guidelines as indicated by monitoring progress; and (h) follow the appropriate
reporting, accounting and auditing procedures.
18.      nzvirgnmenktal Ausg c.  The environmental impact of the project is
expected to be strongly positive. By reducing runoff and increasing
vegetative cover, the project would restore fertility to degraded soils and
improve prospects for sustained natural resource management on degraded land
in the upper watershed of the Euphrates River basin. The project has been
rated environmental category 'C'. The GET subproject would protect the
genetic biodiversity of key herbaceous and woody species in Turkey, in
particular, the wild relatives of globally significant food and other crops.
19.      Proaram obiective cateaories.  The project supports the countryt'
anti-poverty strategy by providing poor and isolated rural communities with a
sustainable agricultural basin allowing for a more secure livelihood within
the microcatchments. The balance between activities with short-term benefits
(apiculture, improved farming methods, small-scale irrigation) and longer-term
benefits (reforestation, improved range management, fruit trees) provides for
a balance between short-term and long-term income gains. The program
objective category environment is discussed in para 18 above.
20.      Benefits.  The project would increase sustainable production of
fodder, fuelwood, fruit, cereal, honey and legume crops and provide income



- 6 -
gains to participating villagers livlng in an impoverished area of Eastern
Turkey. It wruld increase vegetative cover and control soil degradation; by
reducing sediment flows it would prolong the life of dame in the Euphrates
catchment. By supporting a participatory planning approach, it would make
rural service agencies more -.esponsive to farmers' priorities and support
realism in planning. Success in this endeavor would provide a model for
integrated watershed management that could be applied elsewhere in Turkey.
The ERR is estimated at 17%, using plausible assumptions about the balance
among treatments. The ERR is necessarily tentative since this balance will be
the outcome of the participatory planning process in each microcatchment. The
GET subpro4sat could potentially play a major role in developing disease-
resistant strains of herbaceous and woody species.
21.      Rijks. As an innovative project in a difficult agro-climatic
environment, the project is not without significant technical and
institutional risks. Proposed technologies, while successful elsewhere in
Turkey have not been demonstrated on a large scale in all of the project area,
and where this is the case, treatments are reduced to a pilot scale. The
improved range management interventions are perhaps the most "risky* since
they require full participation of villages and Prov-incial Department of
Agriculture extension staff who have limited experience working in high
ranges. To reduce the risks, the project focuses on low-cost participatory
approaches, provision of technical assistance and training; there will be
intensive supervision and a full Implementation Revilt within two years.
Other project risks are: (i) the possibility of insufficient funding by the
government in the face of budget constraints; and (ii) limited experience with
an Integrated approach among implementing institutions, combined with
difficult working conditions in the project area. The funding risk has been
addressed by reducing project size and providing adequate Bank support. As is
appropriate for a project with long term environmental benefits, the Dank will
fund a relatively high share (in this case 70%) of project cost. As regards
the inst!.tutional risk, the training activities under the PPF, and further
technical support, training and a meaningful work program are expected to
improve the working environment substantially. In summary, reasonable
measures have been taken to minimize the risk- involved.  Sensitivity tests
suggest that the ERR is robust to implementation delays, cost increases and
reductions in benefits. The principal risk in the GET subproject concerns the
need for the implementing ministries to work together.
22.      R  ommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
