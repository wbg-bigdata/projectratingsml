INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR THE SINDRI FERTILIZER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to India in an amount equivalent to US$91.0 million on standard IDA
terms to help finance the Sindri Fertilizer Project. Funds equivalent to
the proceeds of the credit would be onlent to the Fertilizers Corporation of
India (FCI) for 15 years, including five years' grace, at an interest rate
of 10-1/4% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(402-IN, dated May 7, 1974) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 20, 1974. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size, diversity, and the extreme difficulty of its economic conditions.
India's economic policies and performance have their shortcomings, many of
which are attributable to the open political system, where the reconciliation
of conflicting political views tends to favor less than optimal economic
solutions; others are due to the sheer magnitude of the task facing the Govern-
ment. Governing a country divided into more than 20 states with a population
of some 580 million and over 60 languages is an extraordinary responsibility.
The country's poverty and poor natural resource endowment, supplemented by
a net transfer of external resources averaging in recent years well below
US$1 per head per annum, have imposed sharp limitations on the rate of growth.
Any judgment of India's economic performance must take these underlying cir-
cumstances into account. So, also, must account be taken of the uncertainties
imposed by the uncertain availability of water. A bad monsoon, which is in-
evitable from time to time, has a pervasive influence over the entire economy
and wipes out the results of years of effort.
4.        In the past 25 years, national income has grown at nearly 4% per
annum, which compares very favorably with the average annual growth rate of
less than 1% during the preceding 50 years. Population has also grown faster
in the past two decades than previously, but per capita income has neverthe-
less risen from a more or less stagnant level in the first half of this
century to achieve an average growth of roughly 1% a year since independence.
5.        Progress has been impressive on many fronts but disappointing on
others and has all too often fallen short of India's massive needs. The
growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport, education, health
services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been achieved at high



- 2 -
cost and has yielded results of variable quality. Many industrial and agri-
cultural investment schemes hlave been highly successful, but others have taken
excessively long to be completed and have operated well below full capacity.
In some regions of the country growth and structural change have been rapid
and compare favorably with developments in many other parts of the world,
but in other regions there has been stagnation and possibly even decline.
Despite these improvements and although the distribution of income in India
is relatively even by comparison with many other countries, there has been
little impact upon the living standards of the vast masses of the urban
and rural population. The Government has become increasingly concerned
about the plight of the lower income strata which, conservatively measured,
consist of some 200 million people with incomes of less than US$60 per head
per year, and has initiated in recent years a variety of programs specifically
designed to alleviate poverty.
6.        In broad terms, the structure of the economy has been slow to
change. Agriculture remains the dominant sector, accounting for some 43% of
national product in the early 1970s compared with around 49% twenty years
previously. The share of output contributed by the industrial sector has
increased only slowly and since the late 1960s has remained approximately
constant at a level of 23%. There has, however, been a shift in the com-
position of industrial production, with consumer, intermediate, and capital
goods now contributing about one-third each compared with an overwhelming
preponderance of consumer goods production 25 years ago.
7.        The economic report contained a review of the immense difficulties
confronting thie Indian economy as the Fourth Plan period drew to a close.
The final year of the Plan, 1973/74, witnessed a severe deterioration in
India's terms of trade which was led by, but by no means restricted to, the
dramatic increase in oil prices. The resulting balance of payments difficul-
ties were compounded by the need for food imports following the drought of
1972/73, in order to sustain the public distribution system on which the
poorest section of society is particularly dependent. Given India's perva-
sively agricultural economy, the drought also had the effect of causing a
general slow-down in economic activity which was further aggravated by
infrastructure constraints, particularly widespread power shortages and
labor problems of Indian Railways. Food shortages and other scarcities
touched off an unprecedented inflationary spiral fueled by large budgetary
deficits which were at least partly attributable to mounting expenditures
for drought relief. The inflation in turn contributed to labor unrest while
efforts to cope with it through budgetary cuts affected, among other things,
the level of real expenditures for development programs.
8.        Thus, at the commencement of the Fifth Plan period (1974/75-1978/79)
the most urgent tasks facing policy makers were: to get agricultural pro-
duction moving again; to bring inflation under control; to reduce India's
dependence on oil imports by compressing energy consumption and by formulating
and implementing programs to develop domestic energy sources; to boost export
earnings and to tap additional sources of aid in order to sustain imports;



-3-
and, finally, to maintain a minimum investment program so as to avoid economic
standstill in the longer run. Even in the best of times, it would have been
extremely difficult to pursue simultaneously such a variety of potentially
inconsistent objectives.
9.        Events since the preparation of the last economic report provide
little encouragement. For the second time in the last three years, the weather
has let down India's farmers with the result that the khariff (fall) crop
recently harvested is believed to be considerably below last year's (about
60 million tons as compared with 67 million tons). The outlook for the next
rabi (spring) crop is uncertain in view of continuing shortages of power
for irrigation pumps and possible fertilizer shortages. The reduced avail-
ability of foodgrains, the depletion of official food stocks, India's
balance of payments difficulties, the inflationary setting and frequent
changes in the Government's food procurement policy have led to hoarding for
both speculative and insurance purposes. Procurement for public distribution
has become extremely difficult. The public kitchens established in some of
the worst-affected areas (Bihar, Bengal, Orissa) bear evidence of the serious-
ness of the situation as well as of the Government's determination to prevent
extreme hardship.
10.       The spectre of massive food import requirements hangs over an
already very difficult balance of payments situation in the current year.
The need for six to seven million tons of foodgrains imports appears evident,
and considerably more than half this amount either has been delivered
already or has been purchased. There is little evidence of a major break
in the prices of other commodities imported in substantial quantities by
India (e.g. oil, fertilizers, steel, non-ferrous metals, rock phosphate).
11.       One of the few bright spots in the balance of payments picture
has been the growth of export earnings. In 1973/74 export earnings recorded
an unprecedented increase of about 30% and there are indications of a similar
increase in the current year. While these increases - particularly that
in 1973/74 - are primarily attributable to unit value increases caused by
worldwide inflation, there is greater willingness to take advantage of
export opportunities, as illustrated most dramatically by the recent diversion
of sugar from domestic consumption to exports.
12.       Nevertheless, despite the increase in export earnings, India is
expected to run a massive trade deficit this year - probably of the order
of US$1,600 million as compared with US$795 million in 1973/74 and a negli-
gible one the previous year. Moreover, despite the magnitude of the current
deficit, it is unlikely that India's imports, excluding foodgrains, will
be as large in volume as in 1972/73. In addition to financing a trade
deficit of this order, India will have to meet debt service payments of about
US$730 million. These financing requirements will be partly offset through
Consortium assistance and USSR aid, which are together expected to reach
disbursement levels of about US$1,550 million in 1974/75 compared with
about US$1,270 million in 1973/74. The deferred payment arrangements for
part of her oil requirements that India is understood to have reached with



- 4 -
Iran and Iraq will also provide welcome relief. Nevertheless, these various
sources of financing hardly measure up to India's current requirements. India
will have to draw on her foreign exchange reserves, which, at about US$1,300
million, are currently equivalent to less than three months of imports. India
has also drawn US$375 million on the IMF in the current year. The Government
also intends to make use of the IMF oil facility, and a drawing on this
facility of about US$240 million has been recently approved for use in
calendar year 1974.
13.       On the domestic front, the Government's present efforts are con-
centrated primarily on maximizing production in key sectors through a system
of priorities in the allocation of scarce resources and through careful
monitoring of developments and performance. In agriculture this entails
provision of power on a priority basis for minor irrigation and fertilizer
production and allocation of adequate foreign exchange for as much fertilizer
as can be imported from the limited world supplies. Similarly, efforts are
made to identify production bottlenecks in such sectors as fertilizer pro-
duction, coal mining and power generation; and special arrangements exist
for meeting expeditiously the foreign exchange requirements of these sectors
for such items as captive power units where appropriate, spares and replace-
ment parts. The railways are also tied into this system and accord priority
to the movement of goods required by these sectors. In the fertilizer, coal
and power sectors, senior officials are provided on a continuing basis with
detailed production figures along with explanations for production shortfalls.
Attempts are also being made to rationalize the administrative machinery of
the Government in these sectors, as evidenced by the October 1974 decision
to bring irrigation under the wing of the Food and Agriculture Ministry
and to regroup power generation and coal mining under an Energy Ministry.
14.       In the short term, however, there are limits to the extent to which
India's dependence on oil imports can be reduced and production of domestic
sources of energy can be stepped up. Insofar as the compression of demand
for oil products is concerned, these limits are determined, on the one hand,
bv the relatively small proportion of oil products used for private con-
sumption (possibly one-sixth) and, on the other hand, by the limited avail-
ability of domestic substitutes (i.e. coal and power). The 13 million tons
of crude oil plus 3 million tons of product imports planned for the current
year probably represent the lower limit beyond which these imports can be
curbed without serious repercussions on domestic production. Had consumption
been allowed to grow in line with recent trends, the present level of crude
and product imports taken together would probably be of the order of at
least 18 million tons.
15.       A major effort is being made to use existing capacity as fully as
possible throughout the economy. To this end, despite the serious balance
of payments problem described above, the Government is pursuing a relatively



liberal policy toward imports of raw materials required by industry. Never-
theless, it is hard to get away from the current infrastructure constraints
and particularly the shortage and unreliability of power supplies which,
though somewhat eased, continue to affect production. Fiscal and monetary
policies, including the cutback in budgetary expenditures and limitations
on bank credit, are also restraining industrial output; and there is some
evidence that, due to rapidly rising food prices and the consequent erosion
of real purchasing power, the demand for some consumer items and industrial
projects is being affected. Given the various constraints, there is likely
to be little or no industrial growth in the current year which, in combination
with the current agricultural situation, makes it unlikely that there will
be any GNP growth either. In regard to inflation, the Government has made
impressive efforts to curb budgetary expenditures and to tap additional
sources of revenue. However, not surprisingly, in view of continuing food
shortages and other scarcities, inflation has not abated. The wholesale
price index, which in 1973/74 had recorded an increase of 29% over the pre-
vious year, has risen by a further 14% during the first five months of this
fiscal year.
16.       In present circumstances the Draft Fifth Plan, published in late
1973, has not been finalized. In real terms investment in the current Annual
Plan is about 30% below the annual level implicit in the Draft Fifth Plan,
and even this is unlikely to be reached. To adjust to reduced resource
availability a number of investments are being postponed. Expenditures on
some of the social sectors such as education and family planning are un-
fortunately also affected. The focus once again is primarily on investments
in key sectors such as fertilizer, coal, power, and steel, and quite rightly
within these sectors the emphasis is on completing ongoing investments
before committing resources to new schemes.
17.       In the long run, given her groundwater, coal, hydroelectric, iron
ore, non-ferrous metals and human resources, India undoubtedly has the
capability to overcome her present difficulties. It is, however, clear that
to overcome them and to resume the interrupted process of economic development,
India will require substantially larger capital inflows than foreseen by the
authors of the Draft Fifth Plan. It is equally clear that as large as pos-
sible a proportion of these requirements should be provided on concessional
terms. However, even on very optimistic assumptions regarding India's suc-
cess in narrowing her resource gap and the response of both Consortium and
other donors, a gap will remain between external financing requirements
and the availability of concessional aid.
18.       India's external public debt outstanding on March 31, 1973, stood
at US$9.9 billion. As a consequence of world-wide inflation and its effects
on India's export earnings, service payments of about US$730 million due
on this debt in 1974/75 are expected to be equivalent to about 17% of mer-
chandise exports as compared with about 26% in 1972/73. However, substantial
additional debt will have to be incurred as a result of increases in the
prices of India's imports. In the future, therefore, the debt service



- 6 -
ratio is likely to rise, given the magnitude of India's requirements and the
unavoidability of having to finance part of these on non-concessional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
19.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 42 loans and 63 development
credits to India totaling US$1,229 million and US$2,880 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$649 million has been
repaid and US$1,169 million was still undisbursed as of September 30, 1974.
Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements as of September 30,
1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.       Since 1957, IFC lGas made 13 commitments in India totaling US$42.3
million, of which US$7.3 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$21.1 million, US$14.0 million
represents loans and US$7.1 million equity. A summary statement of IFC
operations as of September 30, 1974 is also included in Annex II (page 2).
21.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting
minor irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit
operations. Major irrigation, marketing, and seed development are other
agricultural activities supported by the Bank Group. In recognition of the
importance of adequate fertilizer supplies for agricultural output, the
lhank Group has been active in financing the expansion of fertilizer production.
Apart from investments in fertilizer plants, the Bank Group has lent support
to the industrial sector through its sizeable assistance to development
finance institutions, in a wide range of geographically scattered medium-
and small-scale enterprises. IDA financing of industrial raw materials
and components for selected priority sectors has been instrumental in
facilitating better capacitv utilization in these sectors. The Bank Group
hias also been active in supporting infrastructure development for power,
telecommunications, and railways. Family planning, education, water supply
development, and related urban investments have also received Bank Group
support in recent years.
22.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, and transport remains highly
relevant. The priority of tlhe agricultural sector has been further enhanced
in the present wzorld commodity situation. Thus, projects designed to foster
agricultural production through the provision of essential inputs such as
credit for on-farm investments, command area development of existing irriga-
tion schemes, fertilizer and seeds form an important aspect of the Bank Group's
program for the next few years. Special emphasis will be given to projects
designed to increase the productiv ity of small farmers and landless laborers.



-7-
Lending in support of infrastructure and industrial Investments will focus
on energy-related projects.   Repeater credits for power and railways have
high prioritv in this context, and discussions are under way with the Govern-
me:lt in an effort to identify and prepare projects specifically designed
to facilitate coal production and coal transport. Lending for fertilizer
projects, which has been an important feature in recent years, is expected
to continue to occupy a prominent olace in the future program.
23.       Tie need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of Tndia's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic reports
and of the discussions withlin the India Consortium.   The need for readily
viable foreign exchange assistance is especially pressing at a time when
outnut and investment have to be adjusted to a radically different price
situ:ation.  Consequently, Bank Group lending for critical industrial raw
materials and components continues to be an essential element within the
overall progran of assistance.   As in the past, Bank Group assistance for
projects in India should include, as appropriate, the financing of local
expendittures.  India imports relatively few capital goods because of the
capacity of the domestic capital goods industrv. The import component of
projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas as agricul-
ture, education, and family planning. For the Bank Group to be able to make
ain appropriate contribution to the financing of projects in these sectors,
it is important to cover a proportion of local expenditures.
24.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70 the Bank
Grotto accounted for 34,, of total commitments, 13% of gross disbursements, and
12X' of net disbursements, as compared with an estimated 35%', 27% and 37%,
respectively, in 1973/74, and the contribution of the Bank Croup is expected
to continue growing. Whereas on March 31, 1973, the Bank Group share of
India's outstanding external public debt was 21%, by 1979 it is projected
to account for about 257. Because Bank Group assistance to Incdia is nre-
domi nantly in the form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Croup will
rise slowly. In 1973/74 about 12% of India's total debt service payments
were to the Bank Group.
PART III - THE FERTILIZER SECTOR
25.       Increased fertilizer production is an essential element in Tndia's
orogram to increase agricultural production. Approximatelv 24% of total
development expenditure by the public sector has been devoted to agriculture
in recent years, with priority being, given to accelerating the spread of
modern technology through increasing the availability of inputs such as
improved seeds, irrigation, credit and fertilizers. The output of foodgrains,
particularly the high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice, is largely a
function of the fertilizer application rate. It is estimated that, under
present average conditions in India, the application of one nutrient ton of
fertilizer yields an incremental production of five to seven tons of grain.
Thus, shortfalls in the supply of fertilizer, whether imported or produced



- 8 -
lomestically, have consequences of the utmost gravity for essential food
supplie s .
26.       Consumption of fertilizers in India has been increasing at an
average annual rate of about 17% since 1953/54, when it was at a level of
113,000 nutrient tons, but it still remains very low relative to usage in
other countries. In 1973/74 it reached a level of 2.8 million tons, of wqhich
66' was nitrogen, 22% phosphate, and 12% potash. More than 40% of this
total was importe(d. The level of imports, and therefore the increase in
consumption, would have been higher were it not for the scarcity of fertilizer
on the world market and the extremely high prices prevailing.
Currently, India has an installed capacity of about 2.5 million
niutrient tons of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers, which is inadequate
Lo Fleet even the depressed level of consumption.   The gap between domestic
nroduction and consumption is about one million tons wider because of limited
utilization of capacity in the fertilizer industry.    Domestic production of
'rrilizer has drown at an average annual rate of 16% over the past two
.1ecades, reaching 1.45 million tons in 1973/74, or slightly more than half
c,f consumption.  Projections through the end of the decade show a continuing
deficit, even assuming optimistic start-up schedules for new projects and
relatively high capacity utilization for all plants.
".        Only about 67Z of India's installed nitrogenous fertilizer capacitv
",,'IS used in 1973/74, largely for reasons outside the control of the industry
Ltself.  hle largest single cause of low capacity uitilization was power
.-horta es and fluctuations.  It is estimated that power problems and shortage
,f raw materials resulted in the loss of about 112,000 tons of nitrogen
.1r-oriuction in 1973./74. This is about 81% of installed capacity and is worth
about U1S$60 million at present import prices.   In addition, design deficiencies
_nu aging enuiphent result in the fact that the effective capacity in several
-l.nts i- less than the rated capacity.   Projects under construction suffer
l    od..lela-s in co;mnissioning, particularlv because of procurement and start-
:  ff i-ulties. shortages of cement and steel, and delays in the supply of
,quipment.  The Government has undertaken i concerted effort to overcome these
problems and bottlenecks.   I'S$17 million *as allocated for a Plant Operations
;l2provement Progranm in Credit 481-IN of June 19, 1974; these funds are being
used to meet the foreign exchange costs of equipment, materials, and consulting
s.rvices for individual plant optimization programs.
:J)       The present intention is to create an -installed capacity of about
4.9 million tons of nitrogen and 1.2 million tons of phosplhate by 1978/79.
Ile;e tLarpets are reasonable, although they are probably the maximum which
can he accomplished, given the constraints imposed by financial resources
and implementation capability. There are 28 projects under construction or
at sn advanced stage of planning with a total capacity of 3.6 million tons.
..lhen these are completed, about 60%' of installed capacity will be in the
:ublic sector and the balance in the private and cooperative sectors.



-9-
30.       With the exception of three new projects which are coal-based,
all of Tndia's existing and planned fertilizer plants are based on petrolewT
Droducts, including naphtha and fuel oil, or domestic natural gas. In the
long run, coal may well become the preferred feedstock for production of
nitrogenous fertilizers in India, given her sizeable coal deposits and the
impact that recent increases in petroleum prices has had on the economics
of fertilizer production. Expansion of fertilizer capacity in the near
future, however, is expected to be based on heavy fuel oil, because of
constraints on coal Droduction, more immediate economic utilization of
additional coal output as a substitute for petroleum products in power g,ene-
ration and other industrial uses, and the desirability of taking advantage
of anticipated orogress in the technology of coal-based ammonia synthesis. At
current prices, about US$30-35 is needed to pay for the fuel oil for each
ton of urea, which currently costs about IIS$250-350 to import and is expected
to cost about US$175 in 1978. Thus, for the next two or three years India
shotl-d pursue the rapid implementation of projects based on petroleum feed-
stocks which are already at an advanced stage of preparation.
31.       The Bank Group has been actively supporting the fertilizer
industry in India for some time. IDA has made four credits, for the Fertil-
iser and Chemicals, Travancore Ltd. (FACT) plant in Cochin and for the
Gorakhpur, Nangal and Trombay Units of FCI. These projects have all aimed
at a balanced expansion of capacity while at the same time removing bottle-
necks to the efficient utilization nf existing capacity. Work on the three
FCI plants is proceeding satisfactorily. The Cochin II project, which was
approved in July 1971, was envisaged as a follow-up to Cochin I, a maior
ammonia/urea complex financed by a bilateral credit, which was expected to
commence operations in mid-1971. However, labor and procurement difficulties
and problems in the implementation of Cochin I have led to delavs in Cochin
II, which is now almost two years behind schedule. Procurement for Cochin II
has, however, now been virtuallv completed and substantial disbursments made.
IFC has Participated in two private sector fertilizer projects: Indian
Explosive Ltd. and Zuari Agro-Chemicals Ltd., both of which are now in
neration. A 'oan for the construction of a noi IFFCO (Indian warmers Fertil-
iser Cooperative Ltd.) plant at Phulpur, in Uttar Pradesh, has been negotiated
and will be presented to the Executive Directors in the near future.
PART IV - THIE PROJECT
32.       The proposed Project was appraised in Mav/June 1974.    The apprais-
nl report: (Nlo. 569 dated November 11, 1974) is being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors.   Negotiations were held in Washington in October
1974. The Government of India was represented by Messrs. K. Balachandran
and S. Venkataraman of the Ministry of Petroleum and Chemicals, and by
Mr. V.N. Rajagopalan of the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of
Finance; FCI was represented by lfessrs. R.S. Gupta, Director (Finance),
K.S. Sarma, Officer on Special Duty (Projects) nnd Mr. P.L. Ardhanari,
Deputv Chief Engineer.   Attached as Annex ITI is a credit and project
summarv.



- 10 -
33.       The credit would help finance the modernization and expansion of
the Sindri plant of FCI in the State of Bihar by adding a 900 metric tons
oer day (TPD) ammonia plant and a 1,000 TPD urea plant to the existing
facilities, which will bring about a net increase in output of some 136,000
metric tons per vear (TPY) of nitrogen, after some small, uneconomic and
now obsolete uinits presentlv producing ammonia, uren and double-salt are
shut down.
34.       The existing Sindri plant was commissioned in 1952.    After several
expansions, it now m:anufactures ammonium sulphate, double-salt, urea, ammoniuLm
-,itrate, ammonia and nitric acid. Facilities for the production of triple
superphosphate (TSP) are presentlv under construction. Due to the age of
mlost of the manufacturing units, Sindri is able to piroduce only about 50%
of its rated design capacity. Bv 1978, when the project is completed and
the uineconomic and obsolete units have been retired, the Sindri unit will he
a modern, large-scale producer of urea, ammonium sulphate and TSP.    The
rotal production capacity will amount to 235,000 TPY of nitrogen (compared
with the current attainable capacity of about 99,000 TPY).    Concurrently with
the implementation of the project, FCI will carry out a Renovation Program
to repair and restore the facilities which will continue in operation after
conpletion of the nroject; FCI has agreed to complete the Renovation Program
by June 30, 1977 (Section 2.08(a) of Project Agreement).
35.       Two units are involved in the proposed project - a single train
297,nn0 TPY ammnonia plant and a single-train 330,000 TPY urea plant - and
all, necessary ancillary facilities not already available in the existing
.:orks. The ammonia in excess of that required for urea production will be
niilized mainly for the production of ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate.
ihc project in most respects would be a duplicate of the Tangal ammonia/urea
project, for which an IDA credit of US$58 million was approved on January 30,
1973, and will use the same designs where possible. These are based on
modern, commercially proven technology to ensure efficient plant operation.
30.       The project provides for adequate equipment to control pollution
and FCI has agreed to comply with environmental quality standards satisfactory
zo the Association (Section 2.11 of Project Agreement).    Liquid effluent
will be treated before discharge to the Damodar River to conform with
lIndian regulations and the plant will be designed to control atmospheric
erissions to be compatible with European and US standards.    Since many of the
xistinsg obsolete units which now cause considerable pollution will be
retired, the project will have positive ecological effects.    Furthermore,
iCi has agreed to engage consultants for an environmental study of the
existing works to reduce presently prevailing, pollution, and to consult with
the Association with a view to implementing the main recommendations arising
fromi this study (Section 2.08 (c) of Project Agreement).
37.       The principal raw material would be heavy fuel oil (240,000 TPY)
to he supplied hy the Indian Oil Corporation from its Barauni refinery,
-'hich has a heav-Y-fuel-oil production capacity of 400,000 TPY. The project



will also consume up to 275,000 TPY of coal in addition to the 430,000 TPY
presently being supplied by the Coal Mines Authority from the nearby
Raniganj coal field. W4ater will be drawn from the Damodar River adjacent
to the plant site.  Phosphate rock needed for the production of TSP, although
not directly used by the project, is essential to utilize the excess product-
ion of ammonia for the production of ammonium sulphate. Because the supply
conditions for all of these raw materials are becoming increasingly tight,
FCI has agreed to make long-term supply arrangements for them all prior to
December 31, 1975 (Section 2.08 (b) of Project Agreement).   GOI has agreed
to make available foreign exchange for the importation of phosphate rock, and
to ensure thiat adequate railway wagons are made available to FCI for
operations of the Sindri Unit (Section 4.02 of Development Credit Agreement).
Pover will be supplied by the existing captive 80 MW thermal plant, which
will lhave no difficulty in meeting the plant's continuous full load require-
ments of 54 MIN.
38.       The project would be implemented by FCI, a public sector corporation
which was established in 1961 and which is India's largest fertilizer
oroducer, accounting for about 25% of nitrogen and 10% of phosphate capacity
in the country. During 1974, FCI produced 279,000 tons of nitrogen and
32,000 tons of phosphate, operating at about 75% of capacity. In addition
to the five operating units, all of which are being or soon will be expanded,
PCI has seven plants at new sites under construction or in an advanced stage
of Planning. Bv 1979, when all these projects are to be completed, FCI is
expected to have a capacity of about 2.5 million TPY of nitrogen and 0.7
million TPY of phosphate. The management and technical staff are well-trained,
experienced and capable. Because these managerial and technical resources
are taxed by FCI's large Pepansion program, the Corporation relies on outside
engineering companies to supplement its own staff in project execution.
39.       FCI, using its Planning and Development Division (P&D) will act
as prime contractor with overall responsibility for project execution.
Because the project is essentially a duplicate of the Nangal ammonia/urea
project, in which P&D is Dlaying a major role in the detailed engineering,
procurement and construction, FCI is judged to be capable of assuming this
responsibility. It will be assisted by the same foreign engineering firms
who are participating in the Nangal project, Friedrich Ulde GmbH (Germany),
who will provide the basic engineering for the ammonia plant, and Tecnimont
(Italy), who will provide the basic engineering for the urea plant. These
firms will assume responsibility for process performance and will provide
qualified advisors during construction and start-up to the extent required.
Suiitable contracts with both these firmsi for the re-use of the Nangal designs
lhave been executed; this will allow procurement to proceed more expeditiously
than usual and redtuce construction time, with a commensurate reduction in
cost and earlier flow of benefits.
,0.       FCI has a satisfactory debt/equity ratio of 27/73, and its
expansion program will be financed on a sound basis with a debt/equity
ratio not exceeding 40/60. Commissioning of new plants over the next four
years is also forecast to improve the current ratio from an estimated 1.2:1



- 12 -
in 1975 to 2.5:1 in 1984. The financial agreements which have been reached
with GOI and FCI are in conformity with previous arrangements under IDA-
financed projects. FCI has agreed to maintain for itself and the Sindri
Unit a current ratio of at least 1.2:1 and a debt/equity ratio of no more
than 50/50, and not to prepay any debt or make any other cash distribution
if, after such payments, FCI's current ratio were to be less than 1.5:1
(Section 4.04 of Project Agreement). GOI has agreed to provide funds to
FCI to complete its ongoing projects (Section 4.03 of Development Credit
Acreeement).
41.       Total financing required for the project is estimated at US$188.8
million including US$77.7 million in foreign exchange. A breakdown of the
estimated capital cost is included in Annex III. In addition to the US$91
million IDA contribution, covering 52% of total project costs, GOI will
Drovide an equity contribution of US$88.2 million, and short-term commercial
funds of US$9.6 million for working capital would provide the balance. The
capital cost estimate is based on recent estimates for the Nangal project,
uipdated according to actual prices for equipment now being procured, and
adjusted to October 1974 price levels. Physical contingencies provided are
approximately 7.7% and 4.8% of local and foreign exchange costs, respectively.
Price escalation rates beyond May 1974, have been taken at 14% for 1974;
11% for 1975 and 7-1/2% thereafter for equipment and foreign costs and 12%,
10%/ and 8%, respectively, for all local costs.
42.       The proceeds of the proposed credit would be disbursed against
the cost, including price contingencies, of imported equipment, materials
and spare parts (US$54.9 million), the ex-factory cost of equipment and
spares expected to be won by Indian suppliers through international competi-
tive bidding (US$26.3 million) and the foreign exchange costs of engineering
and consultants' services (US$5.8 million). US$4.0 million would remain
available to meet physical contingencies on the above items. If the
cstimated 27% of equipment contracts are won by Indian bidders, the credit
would involve local currency financing of about US$16 million.
43.       All equipment and materials to be financed by IDA would be
subject to international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines. However, in order to expedite the project, well-defined long-
delivery items such as tall towers and large compressors (approximately
IJS$12 million) would be bid using the Nangal bidders list supplemented by
other firms with known appropriate supply capacity. Technically critical
items such as the ammonia shift converter and prilling nozzles (approximately
US$8 million) would have a restricted bidders list approved by the Associa-
tion, and small items costing US$50,000 or less (approximately US$2
million) would be purchased from manufacturers and local representatives of
foreign suppliers on the basis of suitability, availability and price con-
siderations, following approval by IDA of the list of items involved. The
Nangal bidders list, supplemented as above, would be used for bidding on all
other items and, should an approved advertisement placed in suitable interna-
tional publications bring in responses from additional firms, post-qualification
would be applied at the time of bid evaluation. Neither the local costs nor



- 13 -
the indirect foreign exchange costs of about US$14 million worth of equipment
and spares to be procured locally without international competitive bidding
would be financed under the proposed credit. A preference of 15% or the
actual customs duty, whichever is lower, would be granted to Indian suppliers
for the purpose of evaluating international bids.
44.       Urea and other straight nitrogenous fertilizer prices are
statutorily controlled by the Government. The retail price of urea, which
had been kept within rather narrow bounds since the mid-1960's has almost
doubled within the past twelve months. Although an important part of this
increase is used to reduce the Government's losses in subsidizing fertilizer
imports, the average ex-factory price has increased by about 46%. This has
served to offset the increased cost of urea production resulting from the
rise in prices of petroleum feedstock and equipment.
45.       It is assumed that input costs and ex-factory urea prices will con-
tinue to increase, but at the same rate, in the future. The ex-factory price
of urea at Sindri has been projected to reach Rs 1,479 per ton by 1978, and
would then be approximately in line with anticipated long-range international
prices for urea. The retail price to farmers is not expected to increase
above its present level, since the element of price equalization between
domestic production and subsidized imports would be decreased. Assuming an
ex-factory urea price of Rs 1,479 per ton and a fuel oil price of US$78 per
ton delivered at factory, the incremental financial rate of return of the
project is estimated at 16% before taxes and is unlikely under adverse condi-
tions to fall below 11%. The Government has provided assurances that its
pricing policies will continue to permit a reasonable return on invested
capital (Section 4.04 of Development Credit Agreement).
46.       The project's economic rate of return is expected to be 16%,
based on the projected 1978 world price of urea.   Assuming a 10% cost
overrun and a 10% decline in projected fertilizer prices, sensitivity
analysis shows the return would drop to 11%. The economic return has also
been calculated on a probability basis to reflect the uncertainty of future
fertilizer and raw material prices; this analysis indicates that there would
be a 10. risk that the return would fail below 10% and a 10% chance that
it would exceed 20%. The project shows a net annual foreign exchange saving
of about US$68 million, assuming capacity utilization of 90%. The project
will not provide additional employment since it will draw personnel,
including skilled operators, from those plant sections due for retirement.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Generally, the implementation of projects has been proceeding
reasonably well. Details on the execution of individual projects are beLow.
The level of disbursements was $368 million in FY74 or 83% of Bank Group
commitments in that year. The undisbursed pipeline of $1,170 million as of
September 3C, 1974, corresDonds roughly to commitments over the preceding
24-mo-nth perLod and reflects the lead time which would be expected given the
mix of fast and slow disbursing projects in the India program.
Ln. No. 663   Ei-hth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$40.0 million loan of June 3, 1970; Closing Date:
September 30, 1974
Tn. No. 789   Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$60.0 rnillion loan of October 21, 1571; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
Ln. No. 902   Tenth Industri2al Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$70.0 mi-llion loan of June b, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
we ]-established development finance comTpany.  The undisbursed balance of
US$ .2 million for Loan 603-TN as of the clcsing date of Septenber 30, 1974, has
been cance`led; loan 780-IN is fully committed; and disbursements under Loan
902-ZN are ahead of sclhedule.  An eleventh loan to ICICI is tentatively
schedued for Board presentation in July 1'575.
Ln. No. 614   Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 16, 1969: Closing Date:
Decembe- 31, 1 7)
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in the
development of seeds of high-yielding varieties-   The Corporation is working
efficiently and has deveaLoped a reputation for excellent seed quality.   Seed
production is meeting targets.   "mp ementation problems over processing plant
construction and land-leveling have been resolved although, as a result of
these delays, an extension of the clcsing date by two years is proposed.
Expansion of an existing processing plant is in progress, and tenders for a
new plant are under preparation. Large-scale land-leveling demonstrations have
stimulated demand for such work and orders are to be placed shortly by con-
tractors for imported machinery.
Cr. No. 176   Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana Dam
on the Mahi River and the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam. The
project also includes field channe] construction, land-leveling, drainage

works and roads, and a program to support agricultural development.   The
project will be completed about two years behind schedule because of delays
in dam construction.  The agricultural components of the project are also
behind schedule.  Some of the delays in implementation have occurred at the
start of the project before maior investments have been made.   These will
not affect the economic justification of the project. Further delays have
occurred as a result of material shortages. The Government has recently taken
action to make more material available.
Cr. No. 268   Pochampad Irrigation: US$39.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closing Date:  March 31, 1977
The project will assist the comprehensive agricultural development
on the right bank of the Godavari River by providing perennial irrigation to
some 100,000 ha. It includes the construction of Pochampad Dam, a concrete-
lined main canal, distributary canals, field channels, drains and roads.   Until
mid-1973, overall performance on the project was satisfactory with construction
and credit disbursements progressing ahead of schedule. Acute shortages of
construction materials, especially explosives for the canal excavation, have
hampered progress.  As a result, construction of the main canals is now likely
to fall more than one year behind schedule, which is likely to delay the
introduction of irrigation to over 40% of the project area.   Land development
is presently haphazard and increasingly lagging behind water availability in
the project. Government is aware of the inadequacy of the credit operation
for land development and has requested IDA financing for a Command Area
Development Project, to be implemented by a Central Authority for all
farmers in need of land development.

The above agricultural credit projects total US$319.9 million.
Apart from the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization equipment only,
all are srrl ar in stricture, being designed to provide long- and medium-term
credit to farmers through credit insti tutions for such on-farm investrients
as im-crted tractors, mrnor irrigation and land-leveling. Disbursement of
-,oese credits started slowly.  So far as the minor irrigation components were
concerned.. the main difficulties stemmed from the institutional requirements,
-oarticular the introduct-on of changes :n lending criteria and lending
;  and the strengthening of inst`tuti4ons responsible for assessing ground-
Jater availabi]itv.   - e constraints have been overcome and disbursements are
on schedule.  Tractor procurement has been delayed fclowing the substantial
change in both t,he su-pply and deriand s_'tuati,ons since the projects were
ori-g-nally appraised.  Those credits whl c have tractor components have been
a-ended to permit the financir.g of indigenous1y manufaczured tractors as well
as i7rcrted tractors.  Tractor procurement is now iin progress on that basis.
Some funds earmarked for tracters have been reallocated to minor irrigation
components.
Or. No. 267    Wheat Storage; US$5.0 million credit of August 23, 1971; `losing

Cr. No. 377    Power Transmission III Project; US$85.0 million ,credit of May. 9,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1577
Power Transmission II, which is a continuation of the project
financed by Loan 416-IN, has been designed to assist in financing the purchase
of equipment and materials required to develop a power transmission program in
nine states under the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred because
of problems associated with preparing bid documents suitable for international
bidding and the analysis of the very large number of bids involved, but all
contract awards have now been made. Power Transmission III became effective
on October 10, 1973, and specification and tendering procedures are progressing.
Tenders received so far indicate substantial cost overruns.

Cr. No. 481    Trombay IV Fertilizer Expansion; US$50.0 million credit of
June 19, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Cochin Fertilizer Project is intended to help finance the
expansion of fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin. The project is
now proceeding about 21 months behind schedule due, in large part, to labor
and procurement difficulties. Procurement problems have been largely overcome
and most of the equipment is either at the site or at the Cochin port. Another
factor which has contributed to the delay has been technical problems in the
commissioning of the Cochin I plant, which has required a disproportionate
amount of management attention. Credit No. .13' contains funds for a Plant
Operations Improvement Program which w-   be used in part to overcome these
problems; the use of these funds has been identified on a plant-by-plant basis
and procurement has been initiated. The engineering design for the Gorakhpur
project is well advanced and virtually all the equipment has been ordered.
Although delivery of some equipment may take longer than forecast during
appraisal, the project is progressing without serious difficulties, and
disbursements are expected to be complete by the March 1975 closing date.
Engineering work and procurement for the Nangal Fertilizer Project are
proceeding satisfactorily.  The Trombay IV Credit was signed on June 19, 1974,
and was declared effective on August 21, 197L.

Procurement
Arrangements:          All equipment and material to be financed,by IDA
would be subject to international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines.
However, in order to expedite the project, well-
defined long-delivery items (approximately US$12
million) would be bid using the Nangal bidders
list supplemented by other firms with known
appropriate supply capacity. Technically critical
items (approximately US$8 million) would have a
restricted bidders list approved by the Association,
and small items costing US$50,000 or less would
be purchased from manufacturers and local represen-
tatives foreign suppliers on the basis of suitabi-
lity, availability, and price considerations, follow-
ing approval by IDA of the list of items involved.
The Nangal bidders list, supplemented as above,
would be used for bidding on all other items and,
should an approved advertisement placed in suitable
international publications bring in responses from
additional firms, post-qualification would be
applied at the time of bid evaluation. Neither the
local costs nor the indirect foreign exchange costs
of about US$15 million worth of equipment and
spares to be procured locally without international
competitive bidding would be financed under the
proposed loan. A preference of 15% or the actual
customs duty, whichever is lower, would be granted to
Indian suppliers for the purpose of evaluating inter-
national bids.
Rate of Return:           16% (financial)
16% (economic)
Appraisal Report:         No. 569-IN dated November 11, 1974.
