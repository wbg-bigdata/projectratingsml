APPRAISAL OF SINDRI FERTILIZER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.         This report appraises a proposed project involving the construction
of a 900 metric tons per day (TPD) ammonia plant and a 1,000 TPD urea plant
to be built at the Sindri works of the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI)
in the State of Bihar. When the project comes into operation a number of
small uneconomic and now obsolete units at Sindri will be retired, giving
a net gain 1/ in the works' production capacity of 136,000 TPY of nitrogen.
The project will obtain its primary raw material, heavy fuel oil, from
the Barauni Oil Refinery of the Indian Oil Corporation some 200 km distant,
and its requirements of coal for steam and power generation from the nearby
government-owned Jharia coal mines. The project is estimated to cost US$188.8
million (including initial working capital and interest during construction),
of which US$77.7 million would be in foreign exchange. It is expected that
the project will commence commercial operation by February 1978.
ii.        With a cropped area of 164 million hectares, India is the third
country in the world in area of cultivated land (after the USSR and US) and
the second in irrigated land area (after continental China).  The Government
has set a target for foodgrain production by 1978/79, the end of its Fifth
Five-Year Plan period, of 140 million tons based on a somewhat optimistic
estimate of production in the Plan's first year (1973/74) of 114 million
tons. As compared to an average annual growth rate of 2.6% during the de-
cade ended 1971/72, this target implies a rather optimistic 4.2%, of which
1.0% is to be achieved through an increase in cultivated land area and the
remaining 3.2% through increased productivity largely arising from more
intensive use of agricultural inputs, especially fertilizer.
iii.       Consumption of the three major plant nutrients (N, P and K) in
India has increased at an average rate of 17% per annum over the last 20
years reaching 2.77 million tons in 1973/74 of which 1.83 million tons was
nitrogen. Growth in consumption over the past five years however has tended
to lessen and in 1973/74 was strongly limited by scarcity on account of
local fertilizer production falling short of expectations and imports being
hard to obtain and then only at high prices. The Government's current Draft
Five-Year Plan projects nitrogen consumption to increase to 5.2 million tons
per annum by 1978/79 in order to achieve its foodgrain production target.
More recent forecasts however put the most likely consumption by then at 4.3
million tons which would still represent an increase of 2.5 million annual
tons or 140% over that of 1973/74. India's production of nitrogenous fertilizer
in 1973/74 was barely 1.1 million tons, representing a rather disappointing
1/    Over presently attainable capacity of all existing units.



- ii -
67/o of installed capacity, 1/ and necessitating imports during that year of
0.7 million tons. To meet its increasing nitrogenous fertilizer requirements
tne Government, in addition to making every effort to improve utilization
of existing capacity, is intending to undertake an ambitious program to
increase the country's installed nitrogen capacity from 1.9 million tons in
1973/74 to 4.85 million tons by 1978/79 involving the construction of some
20 new plants. The proposed a&mmonia/urea project of the FCI at Sindri is
one such plant.
iv.        FCI ihas five nitrogenous fertilizer plants presently operating and
all are being expanded. It has a total of fifteen, including the proposed
project, either under construction or in an advanced planning stage; all are
scheduled for completion by 1979, by which time FCI's fertilizer production
capacity would be increased to about eighit times the 1974 level. As indicated
in the appraisal reports for the Gorakhpur, Nangal and Trombay projects FCI's
operations continue at this stage to be hindered by low capacity utilization
in some of its existing plants and by delays in commissioning new plants. As
a result, its recent earnings have been unsatisfactory at a return of less
tihan 1% on capital. Steady increases in earnings are however predicted as
capacity utilization of existirLg plants improves and the plants to be commis-
sioned during the next few years achieve profitable operations more quickly.
v.         The project will be essentially a duplicate of the Nangal ammonia/
urea project for which an IDA Credit of US$58 million was approved on January
30, 1973. This will allow re-use of the designs and specifications for the
Nangal project and in turn will permit the construction time to be reduced
with a commensurate cost reduction and earlier flow of benefits. Appropriate
arrangements with the engineering firms who participated in the Nangal pro-
ject have been made including the provision of adequate performance guarantees.
FCI using its Planning and Development Division (P & D) will act as its
own general contractor for implementation of the project but will be assisted
by the Nangal engineering firms who will check P & D's detailed engineering
designs and additionally assist with procurement of critical items of equip-
ment. Furthermore, FCI will undertake with the assistance of foreign experts
aLn environmental survey of the Sindri works which will form a basis for under-
taking an upgrading program concurrently with the construction of the project.
Tne proposed IDA Credit will finance foreign equipment, spares, engineering
and consulting services, and equipment won by Indian manufacturers after inter-
national competitive bidding. All IDA financed procurement will follow Bank
Guidelines.
vi.        Few commercial risks are seen in the project.  FCI has an established
marketing organization and with the shortage of fertilizer expected to con-
tinue in India at least through this decade no difficulty is foreseen in
marketing the project's full output. Additionally with the project being
designed as a duplicate of the Nangal project presently under construction,
on which FCI is playing a major role in design, procurement and construc-
tion, and with the assistance of the Nangal engineering firms, there is
1/    Excluding capacity of new plants commissioned in 1973/74.



- iii -
reasonable assurance that the project will be executed without undue difficulty.
The main risk would appear to be in the present very tight worldwide equipment
supply position and in inflation; although ample provisions would appear to
have been made on both counts a worsening of the situation could cause higher
than anticipated price increases and lengthen equipment delivery periods with
a consequential rise in project costs.
vii.      The project will be financed by an equity contribution of the Govern-
ment equivalent to US$88.2 million, by the proposed IDA Credit of US$91.0
million which would be on-lent to FCI in Rupees over 15 years, including 5
years of grace at an annual interest rate of 10-1/4%, and by US$9.6 million in
sliort-term commercial funds. The project would thus be soundly capitalized.
Debt service coverage and liquidity would be satisfactory and the project's
(incremental) financial rate of return would be 16% before taxes and is
unlikely even under adverse conditions to fall below 11%.
viii.     The economic rate of return is calculated on a probabilistic basis
to reflect the uncertainty of future fertilizer and raw material prices, and
it would most likely be about 16%, which is satisfactory. The risk that
the return might drop below 10% would be only 10% while there is a 10% chance
that it would exceed 20%. The project shows a net annual foreign exchange
saving of about US$68 million, assuming a capacity utilization of 90%.
ix.       In addition to the fertilizer projects already financed in India
by IDA (Cochin II, Gorakhpur, Nangal and Trombay IV) and IFC (Indian Ex-
plosives and Zuari-Agro), the Bank was executing agency for a UNDP project
for an evaluation of the phosphate rock deposits in Rajasthan. The Bank
group intends to continue being active in this priority sector in India and
is presently considering also a project sponsored by the Indian Farmer's
Fertilizer Cooperative.
x.        Based on the agreements spelled out at the end of the report, a
US$91 million IDA Credit to the Government of India is recommended for the
project.






I. INTRODUCTIOT"
X_'1      The Government of India (GOI) has requested an IDA credit of US$91
::i1ion equivalent to help expand and modernize the Siiidri unit of the
Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI).  The Sindri project will add a 900
metric tons per day (TPD) anmonia plant and a 1,000 TPD urea plant to facil-
ities now existing or about to be completed. These essentially produce
ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, nitric acid and triple super phosphate
(TSP), but also include a number of small uneconomic and now obsolete units
producing ammionia, urea and double salt 1/ which are due to be shut down as
soon as the project becomes operable. Th1e project will bring about a net
addition 2/ of some 136,000 TPY of nitrogen nutrient. It will obtain its
primary raw material, heavy fuel oil, from the Barauni oil refinery, some 200
kma away, and its requirement of coal for power and steam generation from the
nearby Jlharia coal field.
1.02      Sindri is located in an industrial district of the State of Bihar
(lap IBRD 10453R) . The original plant was commissioned in 1952 3/ and was
the GOI's first major fertilizer manufacturing enterprise. It has undergone
several expansions since then, the latest being for a new TSP plant which
is expected to be completed by mid 1975. Concurrently with the implementation
of the project the Company will carry out a renovation program which will
repair and restore all services and utilities needed for the efficient oper-
ation of the Sindri unit. By 1978, the Sindri unit will become a modern,
large scale producer of urea, anmonium sulphate and TSP with a total pro-
duction capacity of 235,000 TPY of nitrogen, which will contribute significant-
ly towards overcoming India's deficit in fertilizer supply.
1.03      Following a number of prior discussions with FCI and the Government,
this appraisal is based on a mission to India in May/June 1974 consisting of
Messrs. G. Evans (Chief) and N. Petry both of the Industrial Projects Depart-
ment. The proposed credit would be IDA's fourth to FCI.
II. FERTILIZER CORPORATION OF INDIA (FCI)
A.   Or-aniqt ion and Management
2.01      FCI was incorporated in 1961, merging two puI)lic sector companies --
Sindri Fertilizers & Clhemicals (Sindri) in Bihar, and Hindustan Chemicals &
Fertilizers Ltd. (Nangal) in the Punjab, which began production in 1951 and
1961 respectively. FCI today has five operating units and is India's largest
fertilizer producer, accounting for about 25% of nitrogen and 10% of phosphate
capacity in the country.  During 1973/74, FCI produced 279,000 tons of N and
32,000 tons of P205, operating at about 75% of capacity.

-2-
2.02       Major FCI projects under implementation (Map IBRD 10453R) are:
(a) Durgapur, 1/ (b) Barauni, (c) Namrup Expansion, (d) Ramagundam, (e) Talcher,
(f) Sindri Rationalization, ('g) Gorakhpur Expansion, (h) Haldia, (i) Nangal
Expansion (j) Trombay Moderni.zations and (k) Trombay IV expansion. 2/ Four
other projects are in an advanced planning state: (a) the ammonia/urea plant
at Trombay (Trombay V, which is closely tied to the Trombay IV project), (b)
Sindri Modernization (the sutject of this report), (c) Korba and (d) Paradeep.
FCI is described in more detail in Annex 2-1. By 1979, when all these proj-
ects are to be completed, FCI is expected to have a capacity of about 2.5 mil-
lion TPY of N and 0.65 million TPY of P20  compared to the present capacity
of 376,000 TPY of N and 36,001n TPY of P205 in its five operating units.
2.03       Total existing FCI employment is approximately 19,000, which is high
even though it includes staff for schools, hospitals, townships and training
programs. FCI recognizes overstaffing to be a serious financial problem,
particularly at Sindri, and although no politically and socially acceptable
solution has as yet been found, the current expansion projects should enable
FCI to better utilize its staff.
2.04       FCI has a 13-member board:  six senior officers of FCI, two from
Government ministries, four from other public sector organizations, and one
retired head of a research institute. The Board functions as a control body
and as a coordinating group between FCI and the Government, whose influence
on operations, finance and planning is strong.
2.05       There were changes in the top management of FCI last year (Annex
2-2); in particular, there is a new Managing Director, Mr. K. C. Sharma,
who was formerly responsible for the Corporation's expansion program. He
and five senior officers (Production, Marketing, Projects, Finance and
Personnel) are responsible for policy development and operations; they have
accumulated substantial industrial experience within FCI and are considered
capable. Each fertilizer plant operates as a separate profit center under
its General Manager. The large expansion program now in progress has been
straining available experienced staff in middle management for both project
execution and operations, and the provision of adequate personnel and know-
how is becoming an increasingly important consideration for each of FCI's
projects and operating plants.
B.    Profitability and Debt Service Coverage
2.06       Detailed income and cash flow statements -- actual and projected --
for the period 1969-1984 together with the major assumptions made are given
in Annexes 2-3 and 2-4, and are summarized below:
1/    Under Commissioning.
2/    IDA Credits of US$10 million, US$58 million and US$33 million, equiva-
lent, respectively, have been made for the Gorakhpur (279-IN of January
7, 1972), Nanagal (357-IN of February 9, 1973), and Trombay IV (448-IN
in May 20, 1974) expansion projects.

/1   Based on the revised fertilizer and raw material prices of June, 1974.
/2   Total income less freight, excise duty and miscellaneous receipts.
2.07      FCI's net income was unsatisfactory in 1973 and 1974 primarily because
of operational losses in Sindri and Namrup, and substantially higher raw mate-
rial costs than were reflected in fertilizer prices. However, these financial
indicators are projected to reach satisfactory levels in 1976 and to improve
further thereafter.
2.08      The above income projections for FCI show increasingly large sales
revenues and profits as new plants come on stream. Howeveir, particularly
over the next few years, their achievement will depend on the actual perform-
ance of these new plants and on increased capacity utilization in the exist-
ing plants. It will be remembered that the plant improvement part of the
recent IDA credit in connection with the Trombay IV expansion project (448-IN
of May 20, 1974) was designed to achieve the necessary operational improve-
ments and accelerate plant commissioning.
C.   Financial Position

/1   The current ratio is calculated to reflect only the liquidity of FCI's
operating units and excludes current assets or liabilities pertaining to
projects under implementation which have not yet started production.
2.10      The very large expansion program that FCI is presently engaged in
will result in a 7-fold increase in net fixed assets between 1974 and 1978,
requiring an investment of more than Rs 8,000 million (US$1,067 million) of
which Rs 3,000 million (US$400 million) have already been spent. It is
projected, however, that the expansion program will be financed on a sound
basis with a debt/equity ratio not exceeding 40/60, up from a strong 27/73
at present. Commissioning of the new plants over the next years is also fore-
cast to improve the current ratio.
2.11      To safeguard the financial position of FCI, the agreements, which
have already been reached with GOI and FCI in connection with the projects
previously financed by IDA, were reconfirmed.  These require the Government
to provide adequate funds to FCI to: (i) complete its ongoing and new projects;
(ii) maintain a current ratio of at least 1.2; and (iii) assure that FCI will
at any time have a debt/equity ratio of less than 50/50. FCI further agreed,
that it will not prepay any debt or pay any dividends or make any other cash
distribution if, after such payments, FCI's current ratio would be less than
1.5.
D.   Sindri Unit and Ongoing Investments
2.12      The existing Sindri works has an annual design capacity of 355,000
tons ammonium sulphate, 23,500 tons urea, 9,000 tons ammonium nitrate and
121,900 tons double salt, together equivalent to approximately 117,000 TPY N.
Intermediate products include ammonia and nitric acid, small quantities of
which are for sale. The Sindri complex includes all necessary ancillary
facilities as well as a housing colony, and also accommodates the Planning
and Development Division of FCI which by itself numbers some 3,230 employees.
It is situated on the west bank of the Damodar river about 25 km from Dhanbad,
Bihar and has good rail and road connections. Present plant facilities are
described in detail in Annex 2-5.



-5-
2.13      Due to some of the production units having never reached their
planned output, poor qualities of available raw materials and the old age
of manv of the units, the presently attainable annual capacities vary from
less than 60% for double salt to somewhat more than 90% for ammonium sulphate,
or an average (in terms of N) of 84% of original design capacity. The
production and utilization history of the Sindri works is shown in Annex 2-6;
it demonstrates that the physical condition of some of the plant units is
rapidly deteriorating which has resulted in overall plant utilization (in
terms of N) falling as low as 55% of present attainable capacity.  In order to
alleviate these problems, FCI in 1972 embarked upon a rationalization program
involving the construction of a new 800 TPD sulphuric acid plant (to supple-
ment the output of the 400 TPD unit completed in 1970), a 390 TPD phosphoric
acid plant and a 1,150 TPD triple super phosphate (TSP) plant. These units
wlhich are expected to commence commercial production by mid-1975, will add
346,000 TPY of TSP to the attainable works capacity and additionally produce,
as a by-product from phosphoric acid manufacture, sufficient precipitated
gypsum to meet the full requirements of the existing ammonium sulphate unit.
2.14      The proposed new ammonia/urea facilities which IDA has been asked
to finance will form the last phase of the Sindri Unit modernization program.
They will essentially be a duplicate of the Nangal ammonia/urea project for
which a credit of US$58.0 million was approved by the Executive Directors
on January 30, 1973. Concurrently with the implementation of this project
FCI will undertake a renovation program of the works existing infrastructure,
services and utilities. This program which is estimated to cost US$15.3
million including US$3.8 million equivalent in foreign exchange is not part
of the proposed IDA-assisted project, but its timely completion is essential
to the project. Accordingly, adequate assurances were obtained that (a) the
Government will provide the necessary funds as and when needed and (b) FCI
will complete the program prior to completion of the project.

2.16      The reasons for the poor profitability of the Sindri unit are
mostly to be found in the inefficiencies of the technologically obsolete
Processes combined with the old age of most of the equipment and the fact
that the quality of coal and gypsum has been consistently below the levels
required for efficient production. In addition, poor operating conditions in
the old plant sections which are badly leaking ammonia and other fumes have
made for more frequent plant outages than in other FCI units. All of the
above has led to declining and greatly varying production and to an un-
satisfactory operating ratio of 0.92 or higher, whereas other FCI units
have been operating at ratios of 0.75 and less.
2.17      Another cause for the declining profitability has been that sales
prices for Sindri's products, most of which are controlled by the Government,
have increased much more slowly than operating costs have risen.  Thus while
the average cost of production between 1964 and 1973 has increased by 255%
sales receipts rose by only 165%, both on a per ton of product basis. To
ensure that Government controlled prices for fertilizers are kept in line
witlh rising costs, agreement was obtained from the Government as in the case
of Trombay IV, that fertilizer prices will reasonably reflect production costs
and give a reasonable return on invested capital under conditions of efficient
operations.

2.19      Of Sindri's fixed assets, 80% have already been depreciated and all
long-term debt originally incurred has been repaid, leaving the unit with only
a small amount of debt incurred for financing the TSP planit. The current
ratio is satisfactory as long as transfer payments from FCI's head office are
excluded from current liabilities. The cash deficit of the last six years
has been financed by cash transfers from the head office free of interest
and under no specific repayment terms. This is consistent with FCI's policy,
whereby surplus cash transferred to the head office is not earning any



interest either; it is used to finance operational losses of other units or
is treated as a prepayment of debt.
2.20      Sindri's accounting and internal reporting systems are satisfactory
and the accounts are independently audited in addition to the Government
audit. FCI has agreed to submit detailed annual and quarterly production,
income and cash flow statements, and balance sheets as well as annual audit
statements in a form satisfactory to IDA for its consolidated operations and
the Sindri unit.
F.   Financial Future of the Sindiri UInit without the Project
2.21      As mentioned in para. X.01, most of the existing plants are expected
to continue operations only for EL further three to four years, so that with-
out implementation of the project:, principally only TSP would be produced
from 1978 onwards. The assumptions and details of the financial position
resulting from such a case are given in Annexes 2-8 and 2-9 and are summarized
below.
2.22      The financial projections are prepared by escalating costs and
revenues upto 1978, the start-up year of the project, and leaving them con-
stant thereafter. Although the profitability is poor and at least three more
years of losses (1975 - 1977) are anticipated, the alternative of immediately
shutting down all the existing ammonia units would result in even greater
losses, since the realization from fertilizer sales is still exceeding variable
production costs. In addition, total fertilizer production costs are signi-
ficantly below the present very high international prices making it also
economically necessary to continue production in the old plants. The finan-
cial position is expected to improve as TSP production and sales build up.
TSP prices are not controlled by the Government and FCI has decided that it
will sell the product at a 1975 ex-plant price of Rs 1,842 per ton (equivalent
to an average retail price of Rs 2,239 allowing for excise duty, distribution
margin, and freight) which is in line with the current price of phosphate
fertilizers manufactured in India and with present TSP prices in the inter-
national market which run at about US$300 per ton (Rs 2,250) and above. With
such ex-plant price the financial rate of return on the investment in the TSP
plant would be 12%.
2.23      However, the manufacture of TSP is rather material-intensive and
thus very sensitive to changes in price and operating cost levels. It would,
for example, take only a reduction in the price of TSP of 5-7% to eliminate
profits and one of 7-9% to wipe out cash surpluses. Although the liquidity
and debt servicing capacity would be satisfactory as projected, Sindri,
without the project, would therefore require a very carefully determined TSP
price and tight cost control to make the unit stand on its own feet finan-
cially.

III. FERTILIZER t4ARKET AND MARKETING
A.    Supply and Demand for Fertilizer in India
3.01       With a cropped area oE 164 million ha.  India is the third country
in the world in terms of cultivated land (after the USSR and the US) and the
second one in irrigated land (after Continental China). In the decade ending
1972 the growth rate for foodgrain output was 2.6% p.a. of which 0.5% can be
ascribed to increases in cropped area and 2.1% to higher productivity. The
Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974--1979) has set a foodgrain output of 140 mil-
lion tons for 1979 based on a rat:her optimistically estimated production of
114 million tons in 1974. 1/ This implies an average rate of growth of 4.2%
annually, of which 1.0% would be brought about through an increase in cropped
area leaving 3.2% to be achieved through productivity increases largely due to
increased irrigation, more widespread use of high yielding varieties and
increased usage of fertilizer.
3.02       The historical growth of fertilizer consumption and production in
India is analyzed in Annex 3-1. Consumption of the three major plant nutrients
(N,P and K) increased at an average rate of 17.4% annually over the last 20
years reaching 2.77 million tons in 1974. Growth in consumption of nitrogen
alone has been only slightly less rapid -- 16.1% -- reaching an annual usage of
1.83 million tons in 1974. During the last five years this growth trend has
decreased but it must be recognized that in 1974 consumption was restricted by
import limitations on account of both the scarcity of fertilizers on the world
makket and their high prices.
3.03       In the past a great number of demand projections were made, but
actual consumption has always falLen short of predictions.  The latest detailed
studv was a joint 1971 GOI-IBRD report prepared by W.B. Donde and Dorris Brown
which, on the basis of data for the decade ending in 1969, forecast N demand to
range between 2.40 and 2.91 million TPY by 1974 and between 4.00 and 5.16 mil-
lion TPY bv 1979.  The current Draft Five-Year Plan foresees a consumption of
5.2 million tons of N, 1.8 million tons of P 0  and 1.0 million tons of K 0
in 1978/1979.  Based however on actual data i4ough 1974 recent information
supplied bv Government officials, and taking into account possible limitations
in areas under irrigation, multiple cropping and fertilizer supplies, N
demand projections have been updated to 4.3 million TPY by 1979 and 6.9 million
TPY by 1984 (Annex 3-1). These figures, together with data for the past four
years, are summarized below.
1/    While the foodgrain output projected in the Draft Fifth Plan may have
to be revised downward, this will not affect the priority for the
project.

1984  Probable           6.95            2.78              1.39
3.04       Starting from a low base, fertilizer production in India also in-
creased rapidly over the last two decades averaging 16% per year but still
failed to keep pace with demand.  Consequently total fertilizer imports have
increased fivefold from 261,000 tons in 1964 to 1.22 million tons in 1974.
Production of nitrogenous fertilizers in 1973 was 1.06 million tons N repre-
senting a rather disappointing 55% utilization of total installed capacity of
1.94 million tons, or 67% excluding 0.47 million tons of capacity under
commissioning with its associated production, and necessitating imports of
0.7 million tons. To meet its increasing demands for nitrogenous fertilizer
the Government is making every effort to increase the output from existing
plants and is undertaking at the same time an ambitious program to add new
capacity. Plants already under construction or for which financing has al-
ready been arranged number 20 and have a total capacity of 2.91 million TPY
of N (Annex 3-1). If all these plants should be completed by 1979 the total
installed production capacity would be 4.85 million TPY of N as compared to a
probable demand of 4.3 million TPY (para. 3.03); however, many of these plants
would at best be only at the commissioning stage or in the initial year of
operation so that production is likely to still fall significantly short of
demand.
B.    The Market for Sindri's Nitrogenous Fertilizer
3.05       Sindri was one of the earliest fertilizer plants in India and its
products were geographically widely distributed. As more fertilizer plants
were commissioned, Sindri's fertilizer sales were increasingly confined to
areas close to the plant. The principal market where 81% of Sindri's pro-
duction was marketed in 1973, now consists of the northern districts of
Orissa, Bihar, a large portion of West Bengal and some eastern districts of
Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
3.06       The fertilizer consumption in Sindri's marketing area per unit of
cropped area (Annex 3-2) continues to be below the national average except for
Uttar Pradesh as given in the table below:

All India       10.9           3.6            2.0          16.5
3.07       It can be noted from the table that in comparison to the utilization
of nitrogen, P 205 and K 20 are applied much below the generally advisable 4:2:1
ratio. Greater amounts of phosphorous and potassium will therefore be required
in the future and the production of TSP at Sindri will improve the availability
of phosphate fertilizers in Sindri's marketing area. Since the ammonia/urea
project under consideration will solely produce nitrogenous fertilizers only
this demand/supply balance will be considered below.
3.08       Considerable population pressure in most of Sindri's marketing area
is expected to lead to further increases in agricultural production mainly
through improved farming techniques and by bringing more agricultural land under
irrigation. The demand and supply position for nitrogenous fertilizers (Annex
3-3) during the first three years of the project's production as compared
to 1973 is expected to be as shown in the table below:

3.09       Thus, even when all the expansion and new fertilizer projects, which
presently are under construction or planned in Sindri's marketing area are on
stream, there would still be a shortfall in the overall availability of nitro-
genous fertilizers particularly in Uttar Pradesh where a considerable deficit
(in excess of 330,000 tons of N per year) is projected to persist. Beyond
1980, the fertilizer shortage is expected to further increase due to an anti-
cipated growth in demand and this will require the construction of additional
plants.

C.    The Marketing of Sindri's Nitrogenous Fertilizer
3.10       FCI has established four Marketing Zones throughout India with
offices in each of these zones. Each is responsible for promotion, publicity,
market research, and the establishment of a dealership network. The marketing
efforts are coordinated at head office level under guidance from FCI's Director
of Marketing in New Delhi.
3.11       Sindri is well connected with all parts of the country by broad
gauge rail on which the bulk of Sindri's production has in the past been
moved, road transport accounting for less than 10%. The situation is now
changing somewhat with the Government encouraging movement of fertilizer by road
within a radius of 150 to 200 km. By the time the project is in full production,
it is anticipated that about 15% of the production will be moved by road.
Additional railway loading facilities will be required and are planned for in
the project cost estimate to account for Sindri's increased production. No
problems are foreseen in obtaining about 40 additional wagons perday, but an
appropriate back-up assurance from the Government has been obtained.
3.12       Storage requirements at present are modest because of the acute
fertilizer shortage and it is expected that additonal storage will only be
required by about 1980 when the tight supply situation is projected to ease.
Even at that time it would not be necessary to have godowns in nearby areas,
since it is the Corporation's policy to meet all sales there directly from the
factory. The buffer godown requirement in distant areas would be relatively
small and no problems are foreseen obtaining it as rented space.
3.13       FCI's dealership network in the Eastern Marketing Zone comprises
both cooperatives and private dealers. In addition, the Corporation has
appointed about 300 otherwise unemployed agricultural graduates who are
equipped to advise farmers on the proper use and application of fertilizer.
Emphasis however is increasingly being given for distribution through cooper-
atives and FCI has recently decided that a minimum of 50% of sales in each
State should be handled by cooperatives.
3.14       Fertilizer sales to FCI's dealers are presently against cash pay-
ments with the exception of some areas where one month's fully secured credit
is extended. The terms under which fertilizer is available to dealers is, of
course, greatly affected by the general supply and demand position and it can
be expected that more credit will need to be made available as supplies become
more plentiful. Dealers can also obtain credit from commercial banks. To
the farmer, largely two sources of credit are available: commercial banks and
co-op "banks" which in turn obtain loans from commercial banks or from the
Central Reserve Bank of India. Interest rates to large farmers are about 10%
while small farmers are helped by the Small Farmers and the Marginal Farmers
Development Agencies and pay only about 4% per annum.

IV. THE PROJECT
A.    Project Scope
4.01       The project will be! located within the confines of the existing
Sindri factory and will consist of a single train 297,000 TPY ammonia plant
and a single train 330,000 TPY urea plant and all necessary ancillary facilities
to the extent not already available on the existing works. The capacity of
the ammonia unit in excess of that required for urea production (106,000 TPY)
will be utilized for the production of ammonium sulphate, and small quantities
of ammonium nitrate and nitric acid. The project in most respects will be a
duplicate of the Nangal ammonia/urea project and will use the same designs where
possible. These are all based on modern commercially proven technology to ensure
efficient operation. A description of the production processes involved and the
plant facilities to be provided is given in Annex 4-1. The project will not
include any additions to the existing staff-housing colony and associated civic
works which are adequate to meet all requirements. As mentioned in para. 2.14,
renovation of the existing works facilities necessary for the efficient opera-
tion of the project - though not part of it - will be undertaken concurrently
with the construction of the project and are described in detail in Annex 4-2.
B.    Raw Materials and Utilities
4.02       The principal raw material required for the production of ammonia
will be heavy fuel oil 1/ (240,000 TPY) to be supplied by the Indian Oil Corpor-
ation (IOC) from its Barauni refinery situated approximately 200 km north of
Sindri. This refinery has a heavy fuel oil production capacity of 400,000 TPY.
It is also scheduled to supply heavy fuel oil to the Nangal project until the
Mathura Refinery (140 km from Delhi) is completed in 1978 and will continue to
supplv the Tata Steel Company and the Barauni power station until both of
these industries are converted to coal. The supply of heavy fuel oil is likely
to remain tight. 2/ Therefore assurances were obtained from the Government
of priority of supply of fuel oil for the Sindri project, and from FCI that
it would make arrangements with IOC prior to December 31, 1975 for such supply.
1/    Produced as a bottom product from the refining of crude oil.  Annual pro-
duction of indigenous crude oil has been fairly constant over the past
few years at just over 7 million tons or about one-third of the total
crude processed in India's refineries. Indian refineries presently
produce about five-sixths of the country's total consumption of refined
petroleum products.
2/    Although projected shortages of coal eliminate this as a possible raw
material at present, the FCI has made a detailed study of modifications
necessary to the project to enable it to be converted to coal in the
future should this become necessary. They have concluded that there
would be no advantages in including additional equipment in the initial
plant.



- 15
4.03       The project will consume up to 275,000 TPY of coal needed for the
generation of steam and power in addition to the 430,000 TPY required by the
remaining units of the Sindri complex. Coal is presently being supplied to
Sindri by the Coal Mines Authority (CMA) from the Raniganj coal field some
60 km to the east of Sindri, directly to the works by rail and truck. However,
the proposed project will take its coal from the Jharia field by road, a dis-
tance of 15 km. Particularly since the existing demand for coal will be
intensified by the drive to convert industries away from oil, similar assur-
ances of coal deliveries to Sindri were likewise obtained from the Government
and FCI.
4.04       Water will be drawn from the Damodar River situated approximately
2 km south of the plant site as at present. The river currently serves up-
stream of Sindri, one steel plant and some coal washeries, and downstream coal
washeries and steel and fertilizer plants in addition to the towns of Burnpur
and Raniganj. As Sindri was drawing water from this river prior to the estab-
lishment of the river's controlling authority (Damodar Valley Corporation, DVC),
Sindri was never required to enter into an agreement with DVC for the supply
of this water. Demands on the river's resources are increasing. Consequently,
assurances were obtained from the Government that the DVC would ensure that
the Sindri unit would be able to continue drawing its full requirements of
water from the Damodar River, and from FCI that it would make supply arrange-
ments with the DVC prior to December 31, 1975. Power will be provided by the
existing thermal plant on the Sindri works. This has a total installed capa-
citY of 80 MW to meet a continuous full load consumption of MW 54 of the
existing works. After the proposed project is completed, however, the power
demand of the works will be reduced by about 10 MW. The existing power plant
therefore, after renovation (para 4.01) will have no difficulty meeting these
requirements.
4.05       Phosphate rock needed for the production of TSP will be imported.
Although this material is not directly used by the project a continuous supply
is nevertheless essential to utilize the project's 106,000 TPY ammonia for the
manufacture of ammonium sulphate in excess of the requirements of the urea
plant. Accordingly, an assurance was obtained from the Government of adequate
supplies of phosphate rock for Sindri and that a satisfactory supply arrangement
with FCI would he completed by December 31, 1975. Sulfur ore necessary for the
operation of the sulfuric acid plants is produced locally.
C.    Project Execution
4.06       FCI will be the executing authority for the project and has appointed
a project manager who will assume responsibility for construction and timely
completion. The Planning and Development Division of FCI (P & D) will be
directly responsible for detailed engineering and procurement and in those
activities will be assisted by the same foreign engineering firms who are
participating in the Nangal ammonia/urea project. Because the project will
he essentially a duplicate of the Nangal project, in which the FCI is playing
a major role in detailed engineering, procurement and construction, it is
judged to be well fitted to assume overall responsibility for the Sindri proj-
ect. Messrs. Friedrich Uhde GmbH (FRC) will provide the basic engineering
package for the ammonia plant inclusive of oil gasification technology by



- 16 -
Shell and gas purification by Lurgi; while Messrs. Tecnimont (Italy) will
provide the basic engineering for the urea unit. Each of these firms will
assume responsibilitv for the process performance of their plants and addi-
tionally will assist P & D by checking their detailed designs, by assisting
with procurement of major and critical items using the facilities of their
European offices, and by providing qualified advisors during the construction
and start-up phases to the extent required.
4.07       FCI has already reached agreement with Messrs. Uhde and Tecnimont
for the reuse of the Nangal armonia and urea plant designs respectively and for
provision of the supporting servi ces outlined in para 4.06. Suitable contracts
with each of these firms on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Associa-
tion have been entered into. Thus by reusing the Nangal project designs and
specifications which in turn allows procurement to be commenced earlier than
usual, it is anticipated that the project will be ready for commercial pro-
duction by February 1978, or some 42 months after award of contracts to the
engineering firms who prepared the Nangal project designs. These contracts
involve about US$3.9 million. A detailed implementation schedule is given in
Annex 4-3.
D.    Employment and Training
4.08       There are some 11,930 persons employed at Sindri, 8,700 in manufac-
turing and 3,230 with P & D. Although the strength of the manufacturing per-
sonnel is projected to decrease by 15% (to 7,490) by the time the proposed
project is completed, this is still considerably in excess of requirements.
Consequently the project will no t provide any additional employment and will
draw its skilled operators from those plant sections which are due for retire-
ment on completion of the project. Key personnel will be given training as
required in other FCI operating units utilizing similar facilities and a study
of the training requirements and means of achieving an orderly redeployment of
labor onto the proposed project (para 4.10) is to be commenced by February 1975.
(Annex 4-4). An allowance of USi$0.35 million local currency equivalent has been
made in the project cost estimates to cover operator training. It is not fore-
seen that there will be any need for expatriate operational assistance after
start-up, but if unforeseen problems occur FCI will consult with IDA to secure
outside assistance.
E.    Ecologv
4.09       The effect on the environment of a modern ammonia/urea plant of the
type to be constructed at Sindri is minimal, and no appreciable amounts of
harmful wastes will be discharged. Although a high sulphur fuel oil will be
used as feedstock, the project will include sulphur removal and recovery facili-
ties and recovered sulphur will be converted to sulphuric acid in the existing
sulphuric acid plant.  Liquid effluent from the plant will be treated prior to
discharge to the Damodar River so as to conform to Indian regulations relating
to tolerance limits for industrial effluents discharged into inland-surface
waters. At present, there are no Indian statutory regulations relating to
atmospheric emissions and so in this respect the project will be designed
to be compatible with European and U.S. standards. With the inclusion of
sulphur recovery facilities and equipment to recover fine urea dust which



- 17 -
otherwise may be lost in small quantities from the urea unit, atmospheric pol-
lution problems are expected to be eliminated. FCI has agreed to take all
measures necessary to ensure that the execution and operation of the project
is carried out with due regard to ecological and environmental factors and
to comply with environmental standards satisfactory to the Association.
4.10       The project will permit the retirement of many of the existing obso-
lete manufacturing units at Sindri which are presently causing considerable
pollution of the environment. The project will therefore have a positive
ecological effect. Furthermore, an environmental survey of the remaining
works is being undertaken by consultants with a view to achieving, concurrently
with the construction of the project, a considerable improvement in the degree
of pollution presently prevailing. The scope and nature of this study which
also includes the replanning of the works after retirement of the obsolete units,
safety features and new manning systems is set forth in Annex 4-4. Agreement
was reached that FCI will implement the major recommendations arising from the
survey in a form and in accordance with a schedule satisfactory to IDA.
V. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Project Costs
5.01       Total financing required for the project is estimated at US$188.8
million including US$77.7 in foreign exchange. The estimate is summarized

5.02       These estimates were prepared by FCI based on recent estimates for
the Nangal project. They are updated according to actual prices received for
eauipment and supplies presently being procured for that project and are
adjusted to October 1974 price levels and thus take account of equipment price
increases up to that date in major supplying countries due to the worldwide
inflation and equipment supply shortage. Physical contingencies provided are
approximately 7.7% and 4.8% of local and foreign erected plant costs respec-
tively. Price escalation rates beyond October 1974 have been taken at 14% for
1974; 11% for 1975 and 7-1/2% thereafter for equipment, and 12%, 10% and 8%
respectively for civil works. The escalation is based on a project construction
period of 42 months dating from award of basic engineering design contracts
and including a 3-month commissioning period and assumes that most orders for
major equipment and supplies will have been placed by the second quarter of
1975. Detailed contingency and price escalation schedules are included in
Annex 5-1. Import duty has been taken at 40% of imported equipment and
materials.
5.03       Working capital requirements for the project are detailed in
Annex 5-1 and (in addition to the spare parts separately stated in the above
cost estimates and the initial supplies of chemicals included under equipment
costs) are estimated at Rs 88.3 million (IJS$11.8 million).  This is a local
currencv cost, of which Rs 72.0 million (75% of inventories and receivables)
is expected to be carried as short-term commercial credit from the State Bank
of India.
B.    Financing Plan
5.04       The financing plan for the project will be as follows:

/1    Short-term borrowings.
The Government's equity contribution of Rs 661.5 million will come from the
development budget Rs 407.7 (61.7%), duties on imported equipment and materials
Rs 146.4 million (22.1%) and interest during construction Rs 107.4 million
(16.2%). Exclusive of the short-term borrowings the project will be financed



- 20 -
bv about 49% debt and 51% equity, which is satisfactory.  The timely availabi-
litv of this local cost financing, including the short-term loan from the
State Bank of India, were confirmed during negotiations. Should there be
any cost overrun it will be the responsibility of the Government to find the
additional funds both foreign exchange and local currency to complete the
project. It will also be the responsibility of the Government to provide the
funds required to complete the renovation scheme for the existing works
facilities (para. 2.14) estiniated at Rs 114.4 million including Rs 28.4 mil-
lion in foreign exchange which is not included in the above financing plan.
Assurances on both these matters were obtained from the Government.
5.05       The IDA credit to the Government of US$91 million will be onlent to
FCI at 10-1/4% interest, repayable over 15 years including 5 years of grace,
during which period the Government would bear the exchange risk.
C.    Procurement, Allocation and Disbursement of IDA Credit
5.06       All procurement on the project will be the responsibility of P & D
working from their Sindri offices, assisted by Uhde and Tecnimont from their
respective head offices in Germany and Italy (para. 4.06). All equipment and
materials to be financed by IDA will be subject to international competitive
bidding in accordance with IDAk/Bank Guidelines; however in order to expedite
the project, well defined long delivery items, (approx. US$12 million) will
be bid using the Nangal bidding list supplemented by other firms with known
appropriate supply capacity, and technically critical items (approx. US$8
million) and small items estiriated to cost US$50,000 or less (approx. US$2
million i. total) will have a restricted bidding list. The Nangal bidders
list, supplemented as above, will be used for bidding on all other items and,
should advertisements approved by IDA and placed in suitable international
publications bring in response: from additional firms, post-qualification will
be applied at the time of bid evaluation. Bids will be evaluated by P & D
with assistance, as required, by Uhde and Tecnimont in the case of special
items procured through their European offices. A preference of 15%, or the
actual customs duty if lower, will be granted to Indian suppliers for the
purpose of evaluating international bids.
5.07       Of the total C and F equipment and spares cost for the project esti-
mated to be about US$95.0 million, 1/ it is expected that Indian manufacturers
would be awarded about 27.7% (about US$26.3 million) following international
competitive bidding, 57.8% (about US$54.9 million) would be imported, and
14.5% (about US$13.8 million), not included in the proceeds of the credit,
would be reserved for local procurement. The allocation of the IDA credit of
US$91 million will therefore be:
1/    Excluding physical contingencies.

5.08       The credit will cover the full foreign exchange cost of imported
equipment, spares and engineering services, and the full ex-factory cost of
all equipment won by Indian manufacturers after international competitive
bidding estimated to include US$16.4 million in local currency costs. The
estimated costs of locally supplied items whether reserved for local procure-
ment or won after international competitive bidding is shown in Annex 5-1.
It is anticipated that the credit will be disbursed by December 31, 1977 in
accordance with the schedule set forth in Annex 5-2. Any surplus funds remain-
ing in the credit account after completion of the project will be cancelled.
It is anticipated that advance contracting for services and equipment pursuant
to the arrangements described in para. 4.07 will not exceed US$10 million
equivalent with consequent retroactive IDA financing of expenditures made
after September 20, 1974 amounting to about US$3 million equivalent.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Analysis of the Project
6.01       The financial analysis of the project is done on an incremental
basis for which the assumptions are listed in detail in Annex 6-1 and are
summarized below.
6.02       It is assumed that the project would start commercial operations
in February 1978 and that the capacity utilization would increase from 70%
in the first year (1978) to 90% in the third year and thereafter. This per-
formance is what may be expected from a project where close control is intended
to be exercised on critical design and construction factors and on the means
of production. The economic life of the plant is assumed to be 12 years and
all assets have been depreciated over that period on a straight line basis.
At 90% capacity, the project would produce 297,000 TPY urea and make possible
the manufacture of 285,000 TPY ammonium sulphate and 9,000 TPY of ammonium
nitrate. Some 8,000 TPY of ammonia would also be available for conversion
into nitric acid or for sale as ammonia. Although the project provides only
for the ammonia/urea plants, the revenues and expenses associated with the
production of ammonium sulphate and nitrate are included in this analysis since
the latter two products would, without the project, not be manufactured. The
expenditures required for renovating the existing ammonium sulphate plant and
other existing facilities to take part of the project's ammonia, are therefore
also included in the financial analysis. The Government has agreed during
negotiations to finance the renovation program with 50% equity and 50% in long-
term debt.

6.03       Straight nitrogenous fertilizer prices are controlled by the Gov-
ernment and have recently (June 1974) been revised to the following values
which have been used in the analysis:
India - Fertilizer Prices as at June 1974
Sindri Ex-factory Price    Retail Price
(Rs/ton)
Urea                              1,125                   2,000
Ammonium Sulphate                   578                     925
Ammonium Nitrate                  2,000                      /1
/1   Ammonium nitrate is produced exclusively for Indian Explosive
Ltd., at a negotiated price.
The Government also controls fuel oil and coal prices which account for more
than half of operating costs before depreciation. Costs and revenues are
escalated to 1978 and left constant thereafter.
6.04       The principal raw material, heavy fuel oil for feedstock, accounts
for about 40% of operating costs before depreciation. Fuel oil for use as
a fertilizer feedstock is at present priced preferentially at Rs 398 per ton,
ex-refinery, (US$53.1) by omitting duties and taxes which are normally levied
and which bring the price up to Rs 647 per ton for other users.
6.05       The incremental financial projections for the project are given
in Annex 6-2 and are summarized below:

6.06       Sales are projected to increase from Rs 90 million (representing
onlv two months production) in 1978 to Rs 705 million in 1981 and there-
after. The exDected operating ratio would improve to 0.41 reflecting a
drastic improvement in operatirg efficiency when compared to the existing
Sindri plants which operated at a ratio of 1.24 in 1974. Income before taxes
would, with declining interest payments, steadily increase. Indian tax
legislation, which allows the use of accelerated depreciation for tax pur-
poses, would enable Sindri to postpone any tax liability to later years.
However, taxes are not paid by Sindri directly, but they are presented here
to show the incremental tax liability as caused by the project to FCI's over-
all requirement to pay taxes.
6.07       The project is expected to generate from the beginning of produc-
tion enough cash to meet all its obligations. Debt service coverage, current
ratio, and debt/equity ratio are all acceptable, but are more meaningfully
assessed in connection with Sindri's consolidated financial position which is
discussed further below.
6.08       The financial performance of the project is mildly sentitive to
changes in fertilizer prices, operating costs and capacity utilization. In
1982 at 90% capacity utilization fertilizer prices could fall or operating
costs increase by about 34% to still break even profitwise.  The cash break-
even point would however be lower, allowing a 39% fall in prices or increase
in costs. The profit and cash break-even points in terms of capacity utiliza-
tion in 1982 would be 50% and 42% respectively.
B.    Incremental Financial Rate of Return 1/
6.09       The incremental financial rate of return is calculated in real
prices (Annex 6-3) and amounts to about 16% before tax. The table below
gives the relative change of the return resulting from a + 10% change in
the cost or benefit streams as indicated:
Sindri Project   Sensitivity Tests
+ 10% Change in                    Relative Change in Return
Fertilizer Prices                           + 3.2%
Capacity Utilization                       + 2.1%
Capital Costs                              + 1.9%
Operating Costs                            + 1.4%
6.10       As is the case in other fertilizer projects, the return is most
sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices and least sensitive to a change
in operating and capital costs . About 20% of the cash operating costs are

the investment cost including price contingencies has been converted to
1978 prices.

fixed which results in capacity utilization being the second most sentitive
parameter. Under adverse conditions, assuming a 10% cost overrun on the
canital costs, a 20% increase of fixed operating costs not controlled by the
Government, a 10% lower than expected capacity utilization, and prevailing
tertilizer prices, the return would be about 11% and thus still acceptable.
The tax measures which allow deferring tax payments to the fourth year of
operations result in an after-tax return of the project of about 12%.

6.12        The consolidated projections show that sales would increase more
than six times over the next four years and that the operating profit and



- 25 -
net income would become satisfactory after 1979 when the project reaches a
capacitv utilization of 80% and better.
6.13       With the TSP plant and the project coming on stream, and the old
plants being shut down, the operating ratio is expected to significantly
improve to about 0.7 down from the very high 1.13 in 1975. The units debt/
equity ratio and debt service coverage would be satisfactory and so would be
thie current ratio which in the later years would be substantially higher than
shown, if accumulated cash were not transferred to FCI. Agreement was obtained
from FCI that the Sindri unit should not exceed a debt/equity ratio of 50/50 and
should not prepay any debt or make any other cash transactions which would reduce
the Sindri units current ratio below 1.2. 1/
6.14       The profit break-even point for the unit would be at about 80% of
the assumed capacity utilization in '1978 but would improve to about 56% in
1984. The cash break-even point would be at 70% of the assumed utilization
in 1978 and would decrease to ahout 49% in 1984. The break-even points are
higher if they are determined on the basis of different product prices. In
1984, for example, a 22% fall in the product prices would eliminate any profits
and a 25% decrease would also eliminate any surplus cash.
D.    Product Costs
6.15       A detailed analysis of Sindri's future product costs is contained
in Annex 6-5. The analysis indicates that, at projected 1978 ex-factory
prices 2/ and at 90% capacity utilization, urea and armonium nitrate would
on a per ton basis show operating profits in relation to sales above 50%,
while those for ammonium sulphate and TSP would be around 22%.
6.16       The project is expected to considerably lower the production costs
for nitrogenous fertilizer as shown in the table below:
Comparison of Actual and Future Product Costs
(Rs/ton)
--------Actual ---    Projected
1971   1972   1973   1973          1981
---Current Rupees-   ----1978 Rupees---
Ammonia                           675    787    982  1,490         1,069
Urea                              796    864  1,012  1,536           960
Ammonium Sulphate                 501    590    677  1,028           621
Ammonium Nitrate                   -   not produced    -           1,400
TSP                                -   before 1974      -         1,648
1/    The projections show that the required debt/equity ratio of 50/50 would
be slightly exceeded during project construction. This is due to the
debt being drawn down faster than the equity balance for financing of
the project.
2/    The projected 1978 ex-factory prices are as follows (in Rs/ton):  Urea
1,479; Ammonium Sulphate 760; Ammonium Nitrate 2,628; TSP, 2,032.



- 26 -
E.    Major Risks
6.17       The project faces moderate technical, managerial, financial and
commercial risks. The potential for substantial delays and major cost over-
runs during project executionr is rather low, because: (i) Sindri is basically
a repeat of Nangal; (ii) cost estimates and completion schedule are based
on actual experience so far gained during implementation of Nangal; and
(iii) participation of the Nangal engineering firms to assist FCI during
project implementation. The financial risks are largely determined by the
possibility that: (i) cost increases might not adequately be reflected in
fertilizer prices; (ii) the production build-up would be slower than assumed;
and that (iii) the ultimate capacity utilization would be below the project-
ed one. Given the assurances obtained from FCI and the Government and the
relatively strong financial position of the Sindri unit after implementation
of the project these risks are acceptable. The commercial risks are also
acceptable since FCI has had long experience in the marketing of it's produc-
tion, and the use of urea and ammonium sulphate produced by Sindri is well
established.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.    Raw Material and Fertilizer Prices
7.01      tWorld urea prices ia recent years have fluctuated sharply with
supplv/demand imbalances, new technology, petroleum prices and currency
revaluations. A typical ammonta/urea plant capacity in 1974 is 5-10 times
larger than in the early 1960s. This increase in size, in parallel with
improvements in technology, reduced production costs substantially, and a
large increase in supply in the late 1960s caused urea prices to drop
sharply. In 1970, f.o.b. urea prices were about US$50-60/ton. During
1970-1973, the increase in demand was not matched with increased supply
and at present there is a significant shortage of urea and other fertilizer
materials throughout the world. These shortages along with recent price
increase of petroleum, one of the principal nitrogen fertilizer raw materials,
plus changes in currency values have pushed up urea prices substantially.
Current f.o.b. urea prices are US$200-300/ton.
7.02       W4ith expanding capacity, the shortage should be alleviated, at
least in part, by 1978, at which time it is assumed that a long-term equili-
brium price will be reached. The actual price at which urea might be then
available, however, is quite uncertain. Estimates for the 1978 urea price
(in current dollars) range from less than US$100 per ton to present price
levels of US$300 and more, with most likely values of around US$150 per ton. 1/
1/    The Bank's report Price Forecasts of Major Primary Commodities, Report
No. 467 of June 19, 1974 gives a f.o.b. bagged urea price of US$145
per ton for 1978.



- 27 -
The 1978 f.o.b. urea price (employed as the economic price in this
analvsis) is currently estimated at US$145 per ton.
7.03       With respect to amonium sulphate and anmonium nitrate,1/ the
assumption has been made, that their price relationship to urea would be
rational, i.e., that the three fertilizers would be at the retail level,
comparable on a nutrient basis. Similar to fertilizer prices, shipping
rates are currently high and uncertainty prevails with respect to the future
rates. The assumption made is, that shipping rates would come down in real
terms from the presently high lev ls and would likely be about US$30 per ton
of fertilizer which includes about US$5 for port fees and handling.
7.04       The economic cost of heavy fuel oil, the feedstock to be used for
the project, is taken as the expected world-market price in 1978. The price
for heavy fuel oil in the world market is determined by the price for crude
oil and of the ratio of heavy fuel to crude oil prices. It is projected
that the 1978 crude oil price would be US$10.90 per barrel (f.o.b.) 2/ and
that the ratio of heavy fuel oil to crude oil price would be 0.65.
7.05       Other economic costs have been determined by excluding transfer
payments, and are given together with the assumptions made in Annex 7-1.
B.    Economic Rate of Return
7.06       Based on the assumptions given above, the economic rate of return
would be about 16%. 3/ Sensitivity analysis indicates further that the
economic rate of return shows about the same sensitivity to changes in the
basic assumptions as the financiai return. A + 10% change affects the
economic rate of return in the following way:
+ 10% Change in                     Change in Economic Rate
of Return
Fertilizer Prices                          + 3.1%
Capacity Utilizati on                      + 2.1%
Capital Costs                              + 1.e%
Operating Costs                            + 1.3%
1/    Although the ammonium nitrate as produced by Sindri is used for indus-
trial explosives, it can pricewise be treated as fertilizer, since
there is generally very little price difference between the fertilizer
and the explosive-grade.
2/    Commodities Report No. 467 of June 19, 1974.
3/    In estimating the economic rate of return on the bases of 1978 prices,
the investment cost including price contingencies has been converted to
1978 prices.



- 28 -
The rate of return is most sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices and
least sensitive to operating cost changes. However, the rate of return
would even under adverse assumptions still be acceptable.
7.07       To reflect the prevailing uncertainties of future prices, parti-
cularly for fertilizers, the economic rate of return was also calculated
on a probabilistic basis for which the assumptions are given in Annex 7-1.
The probability analysis indicates that the project has only a 10% chance of
returning less than 10%.  On the upper side there is about a 10% chance that
the project's economic rate of return would be 20% or higher, which makes it
very attractive and amply justified in economic terms.
C.    Foreign Exchange Savings
7.08       The project requires an estimated offshore cost of Rs 583 million
(US$78 million). In return, the project will enable the country to avoid
importing fertilizer whose gross annual bagged value is most likely of the
order of Rs 596 million (US$79 million) at 90% capacity utilization. The
foreign content of operating cost also at 90% plant utilization, mostly required
to meet crude or heavy fuel oil, imports, is estimated only at about Rs 83 mil-
lion (US$11 million) per year leaving the country with a net foreign exchange
saving Rs 513 million (US$68 million) per year (Annex 7-2). Such savings do
not constitute an economic benefit additional to those included in the projected
economic rate of return.
VIII. AGREEMENTS
8.01       Assurances and agreemaents were obtained before or during negotiations
as follows:
A.   From the Government that it will:
(1)  provide adequate! funds to complete all FCI's on-going and new
projects (paras. 2.11 and 5.04);

(8) make arrangements prior to December 31, 1975 for the
assured supply of phosphate rock (para. 4.05);
(9) consult with IDA on possible expatriate operational as-
sistance (para. 4,08);

(11)  to take all measures necessary to ensure that the
execution and operation of the project is carried out
with due regard to ecological and environmental factors
and to comply with environmental standards satisfactory
to IDA (para. 4.09).
8.02       Based on the above assurances, the project provides a suitable basis
for a credit of US$91 million.

I2DIA: SINDRI FERTTILIZER PROJECT
GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS
Ammonium Carbamate - An intermediate chemical formed in solution during
synthesis of urea from carbon dioxide and ammonia. On reduction in pressure
it decomposes into urea with the formation of byproduct water. Ammonium
Carbamate is a higly corrosive material and requires the use of special
materials in equipment required to handle it.
Ammonium Nitrate  -  A nitrogenous fertilizer containing 35% nitrogen made
by producing nitric acid as an intermediate by the oxidation of ammonia and
then reacting with additional ammonia.
Ammonium Sulphate   -  One of the earliest chemical fertilizers containing 21%
nitrogen, now produced largely as a byproduct in chemical industry. Gradually
being displaced by urea although still extensively used, and especially suitable

Anhydrous Ammonia   -   (NH3) A gas containing approximately 82% nitrogen.
tnder pressure, ammonia gas is changed to a liquid and is usually stored and
transported in this form. Anhydrous ammonia is used to make most of the
solid forms of nitrogenous fertilizers and also is used for direct application
to the soil either as a gas or in the form of aqua ammonia.
Biuret   -   An impurity, NH(CONH2)2, found in commercial urea, brought about
by a partial decomposition of the urea to biuret and ammonia. For certain
applications, particularly when the urea is ultimately sprayed on citrus trees,
the biuret content should be kept as low as possible, in the range 0.1 to 0.3
wt. A.
Bulk Fertilizer   -   The term bulk fertilizer applies to commercial fertilizer
delivered to the purchaser, either in the solid or liquid state, in a non-
packaged form to which a label cannot be attached.
Calorific Value  -   A measure of the quantity of heat given out in the
combustion of a fuel. A BTU is the amount of heat required to raise 1 pound
of water through 1 fahrenheit degree at 60P fahrenheit. The calorific value
may be expressed either as gro8s or net. The gross value is obtained when the
water vapor in the combustion products is condensed and the net when it remains
as vapor.

INDIA: SINDRI FERTILIZER PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF FERTILIZER CORPORATION OF INDIA (FCI)
A. Existing Operating Divisions of FCI
1.        FCI is the largest fertilizer company in India with five operating
units, plus the PlanxVing and Development Division, which are described below.
Production capacities in these operating units as well as FCI's new projects
are summarized in Table 1. Historical performance of the operating divisions
is given in Annex 2-3.  Capacity utilization has averaged about 70% for nitro-
gen and about 55% for phosphate over the past three years (1970-1973). Gorakhpur
and Nangal have had relatively little difficulty (except recent power shortages)
and have consistently operated at high efficiency. Sindri and Namrup have
continuing operating problems and operate considerably below desirable levels
of capacity utilization. Trombay has shown good performance in recent years
with the net profit reaching about Rs 81 million (nearly US$11 million) in
1973.
2.        The overall performance of FCI has been relatively poor.  As indi-
cated above, the performance of its individual units vary widely for complex
reasons and these are discussed below.
Trombay (Maharashtra State)
3.        The existing Trombay plant has an annual design capacity of 240,000
tons of NPK fertilizer (15-15-15); 99,000 tons of urea; and 30,000 tons of
methanol. Intermediate products include anmonia, nitric acid and sulfuric
acid. In addition, some minor quantities of industrial chemicals such as
argon, concentrated nitric acid, sodium nitrate and ammonium bicarbonate are
produced. The Trombay complex includes necessary facilities such as mainte-
nance shops, storage, utilities, offices and townships; it is near to the
Bombay port and has good rail and road connections. An expansion of the
Trombay plant to add 355,000 TPY nitrophosphate production capacity has just
been commenced and will be completed by mid 1977. IDA approved a credit cf
US$33 million for this project and other works in June 197h.
Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh State)
4.        This plant, which produces urea only, began production in early
1968.  Goralhpur was financed with a Japanese credit plus funds from GOI and
was built by Toyo (Japan) at a total cost of about US$45 million. This cost is
considered high due to imbalances and excessive spare capacity of some equipment.
The plant units at Gorakhpur are ammonia and urea, with low-grade naphtha serving
as the feedstock. The amnonia plant is designed to have two streams, each with
a capacity of 175 TPD of ammonia. Partly because the plant uses electrically-
driven reciprocating compressors, it has a relatively high operating cost and
high dependence on outside power. The project operates well and can easily
exceed 100% of design capacity on a daily basis. Output has been seriously
impaired by power supply problems; were the reliability of power supply to improve
in Uttar Pradesh, the performance of this plant should steadily increase.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
5.        In January 1972,  IDA approved a US$10 million credit to Gorakhpur
to increase its capacity from 180,000 TPY to 314,000 TPY of urea by 1975.
Nangal (Punjab State)
6.        The Nangal plant produces heavy water and calcium-ammonium nitrate
(CAN) fertilizer containing 25% N, using a process involving intensive use of
power. Initial production began i'n 1961 with a rated capacity of 80,000 TPY
nitrogen. Power supply has been severely restricted, thus limiting production
to 60-70% of capacity. Ammonia and urea capacity expansion is underway,
utilizing an IDA credit of US$58 million. Included in the expansion program
is a provision to reduce Nangal's heavy reliance on power by using a new
process in the old plant.
Namuxp (Assam State)
7.        The Namrup factory produces urea and ammonium sulfate.  The plant
started commercial production in January 1969 but has not achieved full pro-
duction so far. The factory has small process units for ammonia, urea and
ammonium sulfate. A detailed evaluation of Namrup has not been made;but it is
doubtful if the existing facilities can ever be profitable without major
modifications. The plant is being expanded to produce 330,000 TPY of urea, with
the new units expected to go on str.eam in 1975. As the total market for ferti-
lizer in Assam is limited,most of -he increased production must be shipped to
the neighboring States of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
Sindri (Bihar State)
8.        The Sindri plant produces; ammonium sulfate, double salt, urea and some
industrial chemicals. Most of the existing production facilities are old and ineffi-
cient, involving high maintenance costs; and the plant has an excessively
high employment of about 8,700 persons. It operates at as low as 55% capacity,
with major causes for low capacity utilization being plant and equipment failures;
and the high cost of gypsum feedstock for ammonium sulfate is also responsible
for the plant's operating losses. Sindri's financial performance has deteriorated
sharply in recent years and it is a major reason for FCI's poor financial results.
A rationalization program is underway for additional production facilities for
phosphoric acid and triple superphosphate (TSP), and reduction in ammonium sulfate
production costs.  Present-plant facilities are described in detail in Aex 2-5.
Niuch of the_existing plant will be retired  when the new ammonia/urea project
comes into operation.
Planning and Development (P&D) Division (Bihar State)
9.        The P&D Division is the engineering and research and development arm
of FCI. It is located adjacent to i:he Sindri plant in Bihar. It has a total
staff of about 3,200 with about 8D0 engineers and designers working directly
on engineering, planning and technical service functions for FCI units. In
addition, the division develops and manufactures catalysts for use in ammonia
plants and has extensive pilot plant: and research development facilities. The
catalyst manufacturing program is technically sound and some catalysts have



ANNEX 2-1
Page 3
been sold for use in fertilizer plants in India. Over the next few years as
the catalyst consumption grows in the country, FCI catalyst production should
become profitable.
10.       The P&D Division has several license agreements with international
process engineering firms, the most notable being: Montecatini-Edison, Italy$
for ammonia and urea; Lurgi, Germany, for rectisol C02 removal; Shell, the
Netherlands, for fuel oil gasification; Koppers, Germany, for coal gasifica-
tion; and Nissan, Japan, for phosphoric acid. Licensing arrangements for
other process technology are obtained when needed for other projects. The
Division has developed its own process know-how for ammonium sulfate,
ammonia synthesis gas purification and some others. For all of the present
ammonia-urea plants under implementation, the Division has been responsible
for engineering, design and project schedule as well as procurement based on
process design packages from various licensors. Where suppliers' credits are
involved, the foreign process collaborator handles most procurement from out-
side India.
11.          Project implementation responsibilities under the FCI's organization
in the past have not been clearly defined and, as a result, the completion
of a number of projects has been delayed in some cases up to three years.
Except for the Nangal and Trombay IV projects there have not so far been
project managers for each project with overall responsibility; instead the
function has been divided between a site project manager appointed by and
directly responsible to the General Manager of the particular works operating
unit and a project coordinator appointed by and directly responsible to the
General Manager of P and D division. Under this system progress of the work at
the site has been under the control of the Works General Manager whereas P and
D division has been responsible for maintaining the project schedule. This
arrangement is now being streamlined however and in the case of the Sindri
ammonia/urea project the project coordinator will be responsible through the
P and D General Manager to the Managing Director while the site project
manager will be responsible to the Projects Director.   This arrangement is
expected to result in improved coordination and more expedient decision making.
The general engineering capability of P and D division however is sound. Typical
design drawings, specifications and general projects records for a number of
ongoing projects were reviewed and appeared to be   of a high standard.

B. FCI's Expansion Program
12.      FCI will be one of the vorld's largest fertilizer producers after its
expansion program is completed in 1979.  It has eleven major projects (including
three expansions) under implementation at present. The capacities,and
expected commissioning dates are given in Table 1. All these projects are
being executed by the POD Division of FCI with the assistance of various process
and engineering firms.
23;.      Durgapur, Naurup (expansion) and Barauni are similar plants based on
process designs obtained from Mon becatini-Edison (Italy), ind include process
units for ammonia and urea. These projects are being financed with Italian
credits and funds from GOI. Hald.La (capacity: 152,000 TPY of N and 75,000 TPY
of P205) will be producing both u:'ea and nitrophosphates. The Sindri Rationali-
zation Project includes a triple ;uperphosphate (TSP) unit and facilities for
sulfuric and phosphoric acid production. Haldia is the first of the fuel oil
based ammonia plants under construction with an ammonia plant capacity of 600 TPD
and facilities for the production of methanol. The ammonia is converted partly
to urea and is utilized partly for the production of nitrophosphates. The facili-
ties include a soda ash plant based on the use of by-product chalk. The knowhows
used are from Shell, Lurgi, TechaimEt Stamicarbon, Nissan and Polimex.  The
project is scheduled for completicn by 1977. Much of the engineering for it is
domestic, including a subcontract with FACT. GOI is providing all funds including
foreign exchange from Belgian and Bulgarian suppliers' credits.
14.      Talcher and Ramagundam ac well as the Korba plant (under planning)
are large ammonia-urea units with ammonia to be produced by coal gasification.
Montecatini-Edison is the major engineering collaborator with additional
assistance from Koppers (Germany), Lurgi (Germany), and Technoexport (Czechoslovakia).
Coal gasification is a relatively unproven technology in large commercial plants
and the projects are ambitious undertakings. They are in the early design stage
and, because of anticipated design problems, are not expected to be completed
before 1977.
15.      All the new projects wouLd be financed about half by equity and half
debt. All expenses including interest during construction on new projects are
being capitalized so that FCI's profit performance will not be affected by these
projects until production starts. Three projects under construction - Durgapur,
Namrup (expansion) and Barauni - have experienced about three-year delays in
implementation, primarily because of design, procurement, and project management
problems. Work on the IDA-financed Gorakhpur and Nangal Expansion Projects
started in 1972 and 1973 respective(ly. Agreements on procurement between GOI and
IDA are designed to prevent delays on these projects.
C. FCI Board of Directors and Management
16.        The FCI Board of Management is shown in Table 2.  Of the total 13 members,
six are from PCI, two from Government Ministries, four from other public sector enter-
prises and one retired head of a research institute. The influence of GOI, particularly
the Ministries of Finance, and PetrDleum and Chemicals is felt very strongly in
the FCI's management and operations. The organization chart of FCI is given
in ANNEX 2-2.

by the Goverrment of its new fertilizer and raw material pricing policy.
2/  Realization from sales is on the retail level and not on the ex-factory level.
3/  FCI can make use of a number of tax measures (capital cost allowance, development rebate, concession for backward areas,
tax holiday, and unlimited loss carry forward), to defer tax payments to later years.

ANNEX 2-5
Page 1
INDIA: SINDRI FERTILIZER PROJECT
EXISTING FACILITIES AT SINDRI
1.        The existing Sindri works has had as its major products ammonium
sulphate, double salt and urea and its production history of these three
products is given in Annex 2-6. The rated production capacity of each is:
TPY
Ammoniuxn sulphate                355,000
Double salt                       121,920
Urea                               23,470
2.        The double salt unit however was never able to achieve its rated
capacity and during its perfortance test produced at the rate Of only
347 TPD compared to its design capacity of 406 TPD.  For this reason and
because of the deteriorating quality of available raw materials, the
attainable capacity for these three prqducts has been reduced to:
% of
TPY        Rated Capacity
Aaimmonium sulphate               320,000           90
Double salt                        87,000            79
Urea                               20,500           88
3.        Recently, a plant f9r the production of 9,000 TPY explosive grade
ammonium nitrate has been put into production and in addition to the three
major products small quantities of ammonia and nitric acid have traditionally
been sold.
4.        The attainable capacity of the works therefore assuming no sales
of ammonia may be restated as:
TPY
Anmonium sulphate                 320,000
Double salt                        71,500
Urea                               20,500
Ammonium nitrate                    9,000
Nitric acid (sales)                 5,000
5.        Due however to the old age of most of the manuafacturing units,
the works is unable to achieve actual pr1oduction outputs approaching the
attainable capacities of the iraditional units and it is expected that the
output of the existing plant will further deteriorate as shown in the
table on the following page:

Ammonia (sales)                  -           8,200          8,200
6.        During 1975, a new triple superphosphate plant will be commissioned
with a rated output of 3V4.(00 TPY which will be added to the works production
capacity.
7.        The Sindri works is situated on the West Bank of the Damodar River
about 15 miles from Dhanbad inL the State of Bihar. The construction of the
factory commenced in early 19118 under the sponsorship of the Government of
India, with direction of the project being entrusted to a "Chief Technical
Advisor". Subsequently, in 1952 when the factory had commencbd coirmmercial
production, its management was entrusted to a Government-owned company
"The Sindri Fertilizer and Chemicals Ltd."  Later still on January 1, 1961,
the assets and liabilities of this company were merged with those of
ITindustan Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd., Nangal, to form the Fertilizer
Corporation of India Limited.  The Sindri works therefore has the distinction
of having been the first major enterprise of the Government of India for the
nroduction of chemical fertilizer and the first operating unit of the
Fertil-Tzer Corporation of India.  The initial installation at the Sindri
works centered' ,round gas generation, ammonia synthesis and ammonium
sulphate production units and included an 80 n! power station and nearby
townshin.  For this project the Chemical Construction Company of USA were
-,ppointed as consultants for designing and engineering the factory and the
.ower Gas Corporation of the L5 were appointed as agents for the GOI for
orocuremnent of equipment and for plant erection. The construction of the
f'actory wps completed by the end of 19'0 and successful production of
a-nonium sulphate commenced from October 1951.  In this initial scheme,
coke was purchased from nearby steel plants and charged to Semi Water Gas
Generators to produce a mixture of carbon oxides, nitrogen and hydrogen
whichl, after purification, was compressed to ammonia synthesis pressure
and converted to ammonia in four separa-te ammonia converters.  All ammonia
w,s produced for conversion to arnoniur sulphate via the 'Merseberg process.
In this r,rocess ammonia is firlst converted to ainmonium car1bonate by
dissolving in water and then reacting with carbon dioxide removed from the
crude ammonia synthesis gas. The ammonium carbonate solution is then
reacted with Gypsum slurry to form a solution of ammonium sulphate and a
chalk precipitated which is removed in rotary filters and then sold for use
in cement marLfacture.  The ammonium sulphate solution is then evaporated
in a triple effect evaporator and the resulting slurry of ammonium sulphate
filtered znd then the recovered ammonium sulphate crystals dried in a
rotary drier and then finally cooled and bagged.  Very few Merseberg ammonium

sulphate process nlants have been built because the process suffers from
a low conversion of ammonia (approximately 88%) and expensive material
of construction. The site for the Sindri works was originally selected
primarily because of its proximity to the coal fields where a steady
stream of empty rail wagons were returning from L'est Punjab and coul.d. be
used to backload gypsum recuirements.
8.        In 1952 it was decided to construct a coke oven plant at the
Sindri works in order to reduce its dependency on uncertain coke supplies.
Carl Still of Germany were entrusted with this project and a 60 oven
battery with auxiliary equipment was completed in 195h. Initially the
coke oven. gas produced in this plant was used for firing the ovens but it
was soon afterwards decided to utilize this gas as synthesis gas for
additional nitrogenous fertilizer manufacture.  Accordingly, Montecatini
of Ttnlr was  -awarded a contract for the supply and er6ction of a 189 TPD
ammonia plant using coke oven gas as raw material, together with a 406 TPD
ammonium sulphate nitrate (double salt) plant and a 71 T?.D urea plant to
utilize the ammonia produced.  Simultaneously as part of this expansion
phase Powell Duffrey Coppee Ltd. of Germany was appointed to supply and
erect a Lean gas plant of 21 million cubic feet per day capacity to
replace the coke oven gas hitherto used for firing the coke ovens. The
new plants were commissioned in 1959 and considerably enlarged the number
of operational units in the works.  Additionally the purification of the
co'ke oven gas for ammonia synthesis was a relatively complicated operation
involving removal of benzol and other liquid hydrocarbons, the use of low
temperature fractionation  for removal of gaseous hydrocarbons and the
operation of an air senaration plant for addition of nitrogen to the
synthesis gas. Farther the 189 TPD ammonia plant added two more ammonia
synthesis trains making six in all, while the production of double salt
and urea added two new fertilizers to the sale of ammonium sulphate product
previously manufactured. It was found however, that the double sale plant
would not produce its design output during production tests and would give
a maximum rate of 3h7 TPD only. Additionally, the lean gas plant failed
to perform, to design capacity which meant that some of the available coke
oven gas had to be conserved for coke oven firing and could not be
converted to ammonia. To correct this latter deficiency, two additional
lean gas generators constructed by Koppers of Germany were put into service
in 1966.
9.        The armmonium sulphate Plant as installed had been designed to use
gypsum from West Punjab with a purity of 93% and above, being transported
in rail wagons otherwise returning empty to the coal fields of the Sindri
distri.ct.  Itfter partition hmoever, alternative supplies of gypsum had to
be obtained from Rajasthan where the purity was only around 88-90% and has
since deteriorated to around 80-82%. This had a very serious effect on
the ammonia conversion efficiency in the ammonium sulphate plant which
dropped from an originally specified 93.351 to around 84-86%.  With the
enforced alternative supply of lower grade gypsum and the discovery about
that time of pyrites conveniently located to Sindri- the decision was
taken by the Government to construct a 400 TPD Sulphuric Acid plant which



AN1EX 2-5
Page Al
would compensate for the poor quality gypsum by producing the ammonium
sulphate partly by direct neutralization of ammonia. This plant was built
on-the Sindri works premises by "rPhosphatic and Pyritic Chemicals", a
Government Corporation coming under the ILnistry of Steel and Mines and
was conmissioned in 1970. In 1971 the Fertilizer Corporation of India
was directed to take over the plant and has operated it since that time.
.Although the plant was constructed by Simon Carves Ltd. (UK) a firm
specializing in this field, it is poorly designed. Pyrites crushing and
handling equipment is inadequate, causing an intollerable dust nuisance
and the height of the exhaust stack provided (for a single conversion
process) is inadequate and would not meet minimum standards in a developed
country. Additionally inadequate provision had been made for disposal of
acid sludge with the result that the surrounds of the plant becomes a
serious health hazard during this operation. The FCI is presently
endeavoring to make modifications to the plant to correct this latter
defect.
10.       Over recent years thei Sindri works has suffered from its inability
to obtain satisfactory qualities of coals necessary to achieve the dual
objective of producing a satisfactory hard, reactive coke for gasification
and at the same time sufficient quantity of coke oven gas to supply the
two Yiontecatini ammonia plants., The result has been that it has been
necessary to reduce the production of coke oven gas in order to maintain
coke quality. As a consequencEI maximum output of the Montecatini ammonia
plant has fallen to around 130 tons/day. In an attempt to compensate for
this deficiency a small naphthk steam reforming plant with a capacity
equivalent to 60 TPD ammonia was commissioned in March 1969.  The coke
quality since then however has continued to deteriorate preventing the full
output from the Montecatini amronia plant being achieved.  The most recent
addition to the works has been a small (9,000 TPY) explosive grade ammonium
nitrate plant which was conaissioned in 1973.
11.       Currently, the Sindri works is embarking upon its largest
expansion phase to date, involving the construction of a 800 TPD bSulphuric
Acid plant,a 360 TPD Phosphoric Acid plant (expressed as P205) and a
346,000 TPY Triple Superphosphate plant. This project is known as the
Rationalization Scheme because sufficient byproduct calcium sulphate will
be produced in the phosphoric acid production process to supply all
requirements of the ammonium sulphate plant and so eliminate the need to
purchase mined gypsum from Rajasthan. This will not only eliminate the
costs associated with the purchase of gypsum but is also expected to
result in a markedly improved aamonia conversion efficiency.  The 800 TPD
Sulphuric Acid plant which will supply the acid required by the phosphoric
acid plant, is again a single conversion process with the process, basic
engineering package and construction supervision being supplied by 'Techno-
export", an association of Dulgirian industries.  Detailed engineering is
being undertaken by FCI. Provision for pyrites handling involving an
exhaust system with cyclone separators, combined with a scrubber and electro
static precipitator on the gas ;,ide are far superior to the existing 400
TPD plant; additionally the stack height is 70 metres compared to some



ANNEX 2-5
25-30 metrea for the existing plant. The Phosphoric Acid plant is
according to the Pragyn process with Prayon providing the basic engineering
package, and Fertilizers and Chemicals Travencore (a licensee of Prayon)
doing the detailed engineering. FCI itself is doing all plant construction
and erection work. In the case of the TSP plant FCI is using its own
technology and is handling basic and detailed engineering as well as
construction. The Rationalization Scheme was originally intended to comuence
operation about mid 1974 but is running about 9 months to 1 year late with
the delay due in large part to late delivery of machinery and equipment by
Indian  azmfacturers.
12.       The Sindri works since the first manufacturing units were
constructed in the early 1950's has seen several expanrion phases with the
result that it now consists of a large number of individual units which are
of uneconomic scale and additionally make for a difficult and complicated
oVerall manufacturing operation. Further most of the existing units are
now obsolete from the process technology view point, and their equipment
by virtue of ita advanced years is inefficient, unreliable and expensive
to maintain. It is projected therefore that the coke oven, gasification,
avOtnia spthesis, urea synthesis, and double salt plants will reach the
end Of their working life by about 1977 or 1978 and will be shut down at
that time. With the planned replacement of the ammonia facilities however
with the proposed new Ammonia/Urea project, the existing ammonium sulphate
Plant will be coMpletely rehabilitated and kept in service. The details
of the RnoWation and Rehabilitation program which will also cover
esaential services and utilities facilities on the existing works are
described in A*nen 4.2. Aside from the fact that the existing manufacturing
units have become obsolete and are no longer economical their environmental
features no longer are compatible with present day standards.  Accordingly
it is intended to undertake concurrently with the Renovation Scheme a
program for upgrading the environmental, safety and working standards of
the works as a whole. This program will commence with a surrey study of
these aspects which is described in detail in Annex 4-.4

_/   Only a minimum cash balance is kept at the Sindri unit, all surplus cash being transferred to FCI head office.  The unit does not
receive or pay interest on any positive or negative balance of such transfers.  However, the unit does not have to pay
any interest on State Bank of India cash credits as long as the unit has a positive transfer balance with the head office.
In this case the interest is paid by the head office.
3/   The Government of India in 1971 asked FCI to take over the operations of the sulphuric acid  plant which was at that time owned
and operated by PPC   (Phosphatic and Pyritic Chemicals),  another GOI undertaking.  The amounts shown are the expenditures
incurred by the Sindri unit. The sulphuric acid plant has not yet been included in the fixed assets pending valuation of
the taken-over plant.
4/   Suppliers credits from Bulgaria and Belgium channeled through GOI for the rationalization project.

INDIA: SflDRI FERTILIZER PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN THE F:NANCIAL ANALYSIS OF SINDRI WITHOUT THE
PROJECT
A. General
1.       The existing facilities to produce nitrogenous fertilizer can be
operated to about the end of 1577 before major refurbishment would be
required to extend their econoxic life beyond that date. Refurbishnent,
however, would be so costly, that it would be financially and economically
more attractive to stop production. It is therefore assumed that beyond
January 1978 no nitrogenous fertilizer would be produced except Triple Super
Phosphate (TSP) at 326,000 TPY.
2.        All costs and revenues with the exception of phosphate rock and
sulphur costs have been escalated to calendar mid-1978 and kept constant
thereafter. The following percentages were used:
Nitrogenous Fertilizer Prices
and                   TSP
YEAR               Oprating Costs             Prices
1975                   12%                    6%
1976                    8%                     4%
1977                    6%                    3%
1978                    2.5%                   1.25%
Phosphate rock and sulphur costE~ are assumed at very high levels and no
significant deviation from these levels are expected over the next four
years. Therefore TSP prices have been escalated at a lower rate.
B. Revenues
3.       All revenues are ex-factory.  Freight, excise duty, Government
levies, etc., are correspondingly not given in operating costs.
4.       The 1975 price of TSP is assumed to be Rs 1,842 per ton ex-factory
which corresponds to comparable phosphatic fertilizers retailed in India,
and is slightly below the current international price of about $300 (Rs 2,250)
per ton. The assumed ex-factory price would also yield about a 12% financial
internal rate of return which is in line with principles applied to Govern-
ment controlled prices. Production of TSP would start September 1, 1975.
5.       For assumptions with re3pect to prices of nitrogenous fertilizers
see Annex 6-1.
6.       Although production of nitrogenous fertilizer would continue up
to January 1978 it is expected that total nitrogen production will slowly
decline due to the increasing infeficiencies and maintenance requirements
of the old plants.



ANNEX 2-8
Page 2
C. Operating Costs
7.        The following assumptions have been made about the 1975 raw material
prices (all delivered Sindri):
Rs/ton
Steam Coal                 65
Coking Coal                85
Natural Gypsum             150
Naphta                    565
Rockphosphate             610
Sulphur                   600
Pyrites                   200
8.        Bags for TSP are Rs 3.55 per 50 kg polyethylene lined jute bags
manufactured domestically.
9.        Sindri without the project would have to absorb the total labor
cost of the works. It is conservatively assumed that the labor force will
remain about the same, although efforts to reduce it could result in lower
overall labor costs.
10.       Depreciation beyond 1977 is for the TSP plant and some infra-
structure. The TSP plant is expected to operate for about 14 years and is
written off on a straight line basis over that period.
11.       Taxes are deferred to later years by carrying Sindri's losses
forward and by applying a depreciation allowance for tax purposes of 20%
declining balance to SL ndri's fixed assets.
D. Balance Sheets
12.       Cash is maintained at a minimum cash balance with cash deficits
being financed through transfers from the FCI head office. Any cash surDlus
is not kept at the unit, but is transferred to the head office.
13.       Accounts receivable represent one month of sales.  Beyond 1978,
over 70% of the inventories are accounted for by imported raw materials for
which a two months supply is projected to be kept in storage. The remainder
is for finished goodkstorage (20%), spares (6%), and other raw materials
(4%).
14.       Other current assets are loans and advances to employees and whole-
salers which are projected to stay constant at 1974 levels.
15.       The only capital project foreseen is completion of the TSP plant
which will be captialized in FY 1975 at an expected value of Rs 299 million.
The financing will be Rs 132 million in equity and Rs 167 million in form of
a GOI loan repayable over twelve years (including two years of grace) at
7½V interest. The sulphuric acid plant is assumed to be capitalized in 1975
at a value of Rs 33 million, although the actual value might be higher, once
the valuation process has been completed.



ANNEX 2-8
Page 3
16.       It is assumed here, thal; a cash credit with the State Bank of India
totalling Rs 80 million by 1978 is obtained and not paid back during the
projection period. Interest on this credit is 11% p.a.
17.       Long-term debt, reaching it's maximum value in 1975, comes mainly
from aOI (repayable over ten to twelve years at 7V interest) and Rs 25 million
are supplier credits from Bulgaria and Belgium lent to Sindri for ten years
at 5.5% p.a. interest rate.
18.       Except for the additional equity for the TSP plant, no new equity
contributions are projected.
E. Ratios and Break-Even Points
19.       For definitions of ratios and break-even points see Annex 6-1.

FERTILIZER SECTOR IN INDIA
A. Agriculture and the Need for Plant Nutrients
1.        Sown area in 1969/70, the last year for which this information
is available, was 139 million hi. of which about 30 million ha. was irrigated.
Irrigation was specially import;ant in the Punjab, Tamil Nadu, U.P. and
A.P. Because of multiple cropp:.ng in some regions--and especially in the
States of Punjab, Haryana, U.P., Bihar, Orissa and Kerala -  total cropped
area was 164 million ha. (Table 1), of which about 8% was under high yielding
varieties (HYVs). The Punjab isl the leading State in use of these varieties.
2.        In area, the most important crops in India are rice, wheat, jowar,
bajra, gram and other pulses (leguminous crops), groundnut and other oil-
seeds, cotton and sugarcane. Breakdown of crop areas by States is shown
in Table 2.
3.        The yields of the mairL Indian crops (actual for 1961/62 and
1971/72, estimated for 1973/74 end planned for 1978/79) are shown in Table
3. For the five main foodgrain crops the average yield has increased by
26.7% (2.4% annually), but the yield of other cereals and pulses remained
practically stationary. The grcwth rate for all foodgrain was 2.6%/year.
There is ample margin for impro9ing average yields in India as compared to
those obtained in other countries. For example, yields of rice, wheat,
maize, millet, sugarcane and cotton are all below the world's average
(Table 4) and except for wheat in recent years, also below the averages
for Asia.  These figures do not take into account accomplishments in specific
areas, such as the growth in average wheat yields in the Punjab (which
reached 2,413 kg/ha. in 1971/72), way above the world average of 1,628
kg ha.
4.        The Fifth Fiye-Year Plan2/1974-1979 forecasts an increase of
22.8% (4.2%/yr) in foodgrain output from 114 to 140 million MT. Since
the increase in area is expected to be only 6.4% (1.0%/yr), the rise in
output is largely based on increased productivity, the average yield being
projected to grow from 901 to 1,353 kg/ha. (3.2%/yr). This is a substantially
higher rate of improvement than the 2.2%/yr rate registered in 12 years
from 1961/62 to 1973/74.  This growth is expected to be specially marked
in the yield of rice (3.4%/yr) i'1 spite of having been only 1.4%/yr in the
decade from 1961/62 through 1971/72.
5.        The area increase proj 3cted in the Fifth Plan is largely based
on increased cropping intensity as well as on new irrigation projects, and
gross irrigated area is expected to rise by 11.2 million ha. as compared
to 7.0 million ha. in the Fourth Plan. According to the latest country
Bank report,1/ the Fifth Plan asgumptions, however, seem optimistic

and 7 to 8 million ha. is given as a figure more likely to be attained by
1978/79. In what follows crop production and fertilizer consumption fore-
casts are based on the Economic Report's estimates of cropped area increases
of 5 million ha. in foodgrain and 3 million ha. in other crops, i.e.,
77% and 68% respectively of the Fifth Plan's figures. Estimated 1973/7h
foodgrain crop has also been scaled down from the Fifth Plan based of 114
to about 104 million MT.
6.        During the Fourth Plan, area under High Yielding Varieties (HYV)
grew from 9.2 to 25.0 million ha. and it has been estimated that by 1971/72
more than 30% (33 million MT) of foodgrain was from HYVs. However, yield in-
creases are dependent not only on the introduction of HYVs, but also on the
appropriate management of water supplies, use of fertilizers and plan protection
agents (insecticides, herbicides, etc.), time and form of application of fert-
ilizers and other inputs, use of tractors, availability of fuel and electric
power, avoidance of losses during harvesting and collection of crops, etc.
UNIDO has pointed out that use of pesticides in India and Africa in 1963
was considerably lower than in other countries and regions and that yields
were also lower.1/ Thus use of pesticides in that year was 0.15 kg/ha. in
Inida, 1.5 kg/ha. in the US, and 10.8 kg/ha. in Japan.  Corresponding average
yields were 820, 2,600 and 5,480 kg/ha. respectively.
B. Historical Development of the Fertilizer Market
Consumption
7.        Consumption of nitrogenous fertilizers in India has grown in the
last 20 years at a rate of 16.1% annually (Table 5) which is higher than
the worldwide trend, which was 10.4% annually. The speed at which Indian
consumption of phosphatic and potassic fertilizers has increased in the
same period is even higher (Table 6).
8.        A decade ago, approximately one half of the total nitrogen con-
sumption was as ammonium sulphate. The trend towards higher nutrient-
content and complex fertilizers which was characteristic of the situation
throughout most of the world also swept India and at present 64% of the
nitrogen content of fertilizers distributed in India (Table 7) is as urea
and 14% as various fertilizers containing both N and P, such as DAP, NPK
complex fertilizers and nitrophosphates. The same trend is applicable to
phosphatic fertilizers (Table 8). Although the volume of superphosphate
distributed in India has increased by 54% from 1962/63 through 1972/73,
consumption of phosphatic fertilizers other than superphosphate was insign-
ificant in 1962/63, while in the last year only 24% of the phosphoric acid
content was distributed as superphosphate and most of the balance was as
diammonium phosphate (DAP) and nitrophosphates (NP).
9.        The distribution of nitrogen consumption by States is shown in
Table 9. The largest consumers in descending order are the States of U.P.,
Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Mysore.
Rapid growth of consumption in the last 5 years has been registered in
Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Haryana, Rajasthan and Oujarat, while there was
1/ TJNIDO, Industrial Production and Formulation of Pesticides in Developing
Countries, New York, 1972, page 15.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 3
a small drop in Andhra Pradesh. As for phosphatic and potassic fertilizer
consumption, the six highest consumers are the same States as for nitrogen,
although in different order (Table 10).
10.       Leaving aside Pondicherry and Delhi, which have very small areas,
intensity of fertilization (TabLe 11) is highest in the States of Punjab
(59 kg/ha), and Tamil Nadu (45 kg/ha), followed by Kerala, U.P., and Andhra
Pradesh (all more than 20 kg/ha). In Assam and Rajasthan, on the other
hand, average chemical fertilizer dosages are less than 5 kg/ha. Even in
the same State, there are great variations in different districts. Average
dosages and per capita consumptiLon of fertilizers in several countries
are shown in Table 12. India's intensity of fertilization (kg/ha of arable
land) is higher than the average for all developing countries but lower
than for Asia and only about one third the world average. Because of the
high population pressure on culltivated land, India's position is even more
disadvantaged if measured by per capita consumption of fertilizers.  Although
comparisons of this type should not be made without consideration of types
of crops grown, extent of irrigation and agricultural practices, the Table
does indicate that there is undoubtedly a case for increasing use of fert-
ilizers in India.
11.       The distribution of various types of fertilizers among the States
is not uniform. Thus, the largest share of urea distributed in 1972/73
(23%) went to U.P. while the largest volume of CAN (also 23%) went to Punjab
and 47% of nitrophosphates went to Maharashtra. Only a small portion of
complex fertilizers were distributed in the northern, central and eastern
states, while 47% went to two southern states: Tamil Nadu and Andhra
Pradesh!/. The greater part of the fertilizers is used during rabi. In
the case of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers, the proportion averaged:
57% in 1970/71, 58% in 1971/72 End 61% in 1972/73. On the other hand, the
proportion of potassic fertilizer consumed in the rabi season, which was
59% in 1970/71 and 61% in 1971/72, dropped to 56% in 1972/73 (Table 10).
Production
12.       In the 10-year period from 1957/58 to 1967/68, the average rate
of growth of domestic production of nitrogenous fertilizers2! fell behind
the growth in consumption.  In the years 1969/70 and 1970/71, increase3/
in production was higher than increase in consumption; in 1971/72, rate of
growth of consumption again overtook that of production; and in 1972/73, an
increase in production of 11.1% over the previous year was much higher
than consumption (Table 5). Preliminary figures for 1973/74., based on
April/December data for all plants and preliminary full-year data for the
rest of the season, indicate that production kept practically level with
production in the previous year. Growth of phosphatic fertilizer production
practically parallels that of nitrogenous fertilizers, both having increased
about 13-fold in the 15-year period from 1957/58 to 1972/73 (Table 6).
Basic potassic fertilizers are not produced in India; although complex
NPK fertilizers are manufactured domestically they are all made from imported

potassium salts.
13.       Until 1958/59, the only nitrogenous fertilizer produced in India
was aimmonium sulphatel/.  In 1959/60, production of ammonium sulphate
nitrate, ammonium chloride and urea was begun and a year later, calcium
ambonium nitrate (Table 13). At present (1972/73), 62% of the N content
in the Indian fertilizer output is in the form of urea, and that of
ammonium sulphate has dropped to only 10.8%. A similar change has oeCcrred
with phosphatic fertilizers (Table 14). Production of fertilizers other
than single superphosphate was not significant until 1965/66. In 1966/67,
almost 18% of P205 content in domestic fertilizers was as amonium phosphate,
s]Phate and nitrophosphate. In 1972/73, the proportion of P205 in fert-
ilizers other than superphosphates had risen to 64%. Triple superphosphate,
however, has never become an important item.
14.       Production of nitrogen fertilizers by States is shown in Table
15. Only four States   Rajasthan, Assam, Orissa and Gujarat - produce
more nitrogen in fertiLizers than they consume. Of the others, many are
small consumers, but four - U.P., Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Mysore - have
annual deficits of over 100,000 MT of N, and four others of more than
50,O00 MT: Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Majarashtra.  U.P.,
Punjab, and Mysore also have substantial deficits in P20c (Table 16),
while Maharashtra and Delhi have had surpluses in 1972773.
C. Fertilizer Market Projections
Consumption
15.       There are several systems that can be used to forecast future
fertilizer damand and consumption. The first step is to differentiate
between requirements and actual consumption forecasts. Unfortunately
procedures for requirement calculations are not yet generally available;
estimates based on physical depletion of nutrients from the soil may be
correct for small plots under controlled conditions - and even in these
cases they leave many factors undefined - while calculations based on
economically or financially optimum dosages for each crop are misleading
generally resulting in forecasts that are too high when compared with
actual results. These optimum dosage levels must be tempered by consider-
ation of the element of risk (the farmer may well forego the expectation
of a higher return on his money in view of the potential loss of all or
most of what he has because of weather conditions), the lack of financing
for fertilizers and other inputs, the physical lack or scarcity of fert-
ilizers when they are needed or general lack of education of individual
farmers.
16.       One sy5stem frequently followed by market forecasters is to
estimate future consumption on the base of trend lines (generally on a
semi-logaritlmis scale, that is at a constant compoundedgrowth rate)
which are either automatically extrapolated at the same rate, or at
modified rates to take into account varying conditions. This system has
the defect of giving excessively high projections when applied to historical
data for new products which begin at extremely low levels of consumption.

ANNEX 3-1
Page 5
The generally observed fact of maturity obse-rved in the S-shaped long-term
trend lines of many growth phenomena can be introduced into the calculation
by observing whether the annual growth rate is accelerating or not during
the period covered by actual data; unfortunately determination of the
inflection point in many cases is not precise. Another widely used system
is based on recommended dosages for and areas under each crop. This metkod
should be the mest accurate shwrt-term but experience shows that farmers
do not apply fertilizer at the rates recommended and therefore an element
of subjective evaluation enter3 the calculation of effective as compared
to recommended dosages. A com3arison of food and fertilizer requirements
based on forecasts of populati,n and per capita income and food intake for
different countries has some times been used for fertilizer requirement
projections. However, relatioiships between volume of crops and use of
fertilizer are not well defined; they vary considerably not only from country
to country but from region to :r'egion and even in small areas within one
country. Furthermore, it does not take into account genetic improvements,
use of herbicides and other pe3ticides, avoidance of losses after harresting,
etc.
17.       On one occasion or a.aother, various forecasting systems have been
used in India but actual figur3s have never matched and have always been
lower than predicted consumpti n. The Donde-Brown projections were primarily
based on district-by-district :-egression eqtuations for the period 1959-
1969. The technique used, as tlescribed by the authors, involved making some
assumptions on various factors,
"Projections we:e based on a close examination of
the factors that influenced changes in sales during
the ten years up to 1968/690 During this period,
demand was influenced most by the cultivator1s previous
experience from the tlse of fertilizers (the learning
process) and the ara. irrigated and planted to selected
crops known to have oonsumed most of this material.
These factors explained 70 to 90 percent of the changes
in demand. Other faotors, not measurable with the
available data and aasumed to be important, included
the availability and use of agricultural credit, market
and transport facilities and promotional efforts.
"The above factors were used to project demand
for N plus P205 for oach district after making
appropriate assumptions regarding changes in their
growth rates. Inheremt in these assumptions were
the investments needod and time required to expand
irrigation resources, develop and adopt new technologies,
increase the availabf.lity of agricultuLral power and
expand the agricultural input and commodity marketing
systems. It was assumed that cost/benefit relationships
would be about the same as observed during 1967 to 1969.
In some districts assumptions included improvements in
agricultural credit znd transportation resources.1/"'

1973/74).  For the next five years consumption has been projected to incrwase
at a more moderate rate of 10% annually to reach a level of 6.95 million
MT of N by 1983/84.
20.       A very serious balanes of payments situation could have a farther
limiting effect on fertilizer consumption. A "low" projection is ahovu in
Table 17, below which foodgrain production would incroase at a lower rate
than population, forcing imports to rise considerably above the present level.
Even this "low" projection, however, implies an average annual growth of
13.8% in N consUmption, ibich is not far from the 14.2% rate attained in
the previous five years, when the full impact of rising petroleum and fert-
ilizer prices had not yet been felt.

21.       The proportion of the three main nutrients has been tilted in
favor of nitrogen, both by the faster response obtained with this nutrient
and also by the fertilizer distribution system. The ratio N-P 0 :K which
used to be about 10: 1.3:1 in 1953/54 is now 5.5: 1.8: 1, still higher in
N than the ratio 4 : 2 : 1 generally considered desirable under Indian
agricultural conditions. For 1978/79, the Fifth Five-Year Plan calls for
a ratio of about 5 : 2.3 : 1, which may not be realized in five years.
The following projections are based on a 5.5 : 2 : 1 ratio for 1978/79 and
5 : 2 : 1 for 1983/84.

_/ Three-year averages have been used to smooth out the relatively low
values registered in 1973/l74 as a consequence of the spur in fertilizer
prices and the scarcity of foreign and domestic supplies.
D.  Production, Imports and Distribution
22.       Actual capacity of existing nitrogenous fertilizer plants is
shown in Table 18. Utilizatiork of capacity has generally been low. For
1973/74 it was only 55%I but if the FCI's Durgapur and Cochin plants and
Zuari Agro's Goa plant -- whichi were only being tested or had just begun
comercial production -- are excluded from the 1973t?14 figures, capacity
utilization rises to 67%.  Furthermore, fertilizer plants were hit last
fiscal year by disruptions in operation outside their control, mainly power
failures and shortage of raw materials, which have been estimated to have
resulted in a loss of production about 112,000 MT of N or approximately
9% of the installed capacity. An additional loss in output of about 45,000
MT may be ascribed to obsolete equipment in old plants (mainly FCI's Sindri),
about 28,000 tons to labour problems, and losses in production arising from
defective design (Neyveli, Baroda).



ANNEX 3-1
Page 8
23.       Plants now under construction or ready for financing have a
total capacity of 2.9 million MT of nitrogen. 36% of this capacity is
based on fuel oil as feedstock. Considering the dates of commissioning
of these plants and the difficulties in production that may be faced by
some of them, projected output fromri these plants is expected to be about
1.9 million MT by 1978/79 and 2.5 million MT by 1983/84 (Table 19).
Eight other plants have also been approved in princile by the GOI or are
under consideration for financing. Their total capacity is 1.96 million
MT annually distributed as shown below, but no more than one or two of these
plants at best is expected to be commissioned by 1978/79:
MT/year
Public Sector plants (Mathura, Panipat  Paradeep)    815,000
Private Sector (SCI, Shaw-Wallace, DON)               900,000
Mixed Sector (GSFC)                                   243,000
1 ,98,000
Still other plants are mentioned as being under consideration but no rapid
implementation of them can be seen. None is expected to be on-stream by
1978/79 and no more than about 0.5 million MT capacity by 1983/84:
MT/year
Zuari Agro at Kamptee                                 228,000
Mangalore Chem-&-Fert. Expansion                       228,000

Andrew-Yule in U.P.                                    228,000
Maharashtra Cooperative Fert. & Chem.                   60,000
New Central Jute Mills Co. at Varanasi, U.P.            20,000
Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corp.                 10,000
1,002,000
24.       Installed annual capacity of phosphatic fertilizer plants is
0.57 million MT (Table 20). Average capacity utilization in 1972/73 was
56t but some plants (DCM, FCI's Trombay and Coromandel) have attained much
higher rates of utilization. One plant - Zuari Agro's Goa plant - has been
included in the total capacity but has not yet begun production. This
branch of the fertilizer industry also has a large proportion (30%) of very
small superphosphate plants, for which fixed capital-related costs are not
very important and which show an average capacity utilization rate of only
42%. Approximately 0.66 million MT of new capacity is expected to be
added in 8 projects under ccnstruction or ready for financing, while there
are 6 other projects which may be built (but probably after 1978/79) which
would further increase P205 capacity by 1.02 million MT annually.
25.       Production projections for 1978/79 and 1983/84 (Table 21) indicate
that the main problem in India is not that the market may not absorb the
output of existing plants and those likely to be put in operation in the next
10 years, but that supply - from both domestic sources and imports (limited
in turn by high prices and availability in the world market) - will not be
able to meet demand.

20.       Imports of fertiLLzer are the responsibility of the "Central
Fertilizer Pool" a government institution established in 1942 as a trading
agency to give support to the "Grow More Food" campaign instituted as a
result of the famine in Bengal.  By 1947, when the first public sector
factory (owned by FACT) began operations, the Pool also undertook the alloc-
ation of nitrogenous fertilizers to the State Governments. These fertil-
izers were then distributed by the States through the cooperatives, private
dealers or agencies of their own. After 1966, except for 30% of straight
nitrogenous fertilizers that can be reserved by the Central Government,
domestic producers were allowed to market their own products or appoint
agencies of their choice. Statewide distribution of fertilizers is mainly
controlled by the State government1/ and entrusted to cooperatives,
manufacturers' agencies, prirate dealers and, in some cases, to Agro-
Industries Corporations (which in turn may have a choice of dealers of their
own or work through private {healers). Some States have also developed
their owm distributorships, for instance the Agriculture Supply Organization
in UP or have used other organizations such as the Food Corp. of India.
FCT has been asked to sell 50% of its output through the State governments
for distribution through cooperatives and other public sector agencies.
7 The GOI irn times of scarcity has had to invoke the Essential Commodities
Act to prevent State governments from impeding shipping of fertilizers
produced by factories located in their States to other States.

No attempt has been made to combine "probablef" consumption and "low" production projections because to a
considerable degree consumption will depend on the availability of domestically made fertilizers.
Therefore, "probable" consumption projections are matched with "probable" production projections
and "low" consumption projections with "low" production projections.

STATE OF AGRICULIURE [N SINDRI'S MARKETING AREA
A. Land Utilization
1.        Sindri's economic marketing area includes the States of Bihar, a large
portion of West Bengal, some district; of Uttar Pradesh (U.P.), the northern dis-
tricts of Orissa and the eastern districts of Madhya Pradesh (M.P.). There are
possibilities for further intensive cultivation in these different States. The
land utilization in the concerned Staites is as under:

2.        As the table indicates, the land use pattern in most of the States is
better than the Indian average, particularly in West Bengal which has about 6h%
of its total area under cultivation. This results largely from the existing
population pressure with densities considerably above Indian average of 182
persons per square kilometer. The population pressure and the limited availability
of cultivated land lead also to extensive use of multiple cropping as a means for
increasing agricultural production.
B. Climate and Soils
3.        Substantial areas in the Sindri marketing area are in high rainfall
areas receiving more than 1200 mm rain per year. In the five States taken to-
gether, the area falling under such high rainfall exceeds 54% of the gross
cropped area. More than 75% of the annual rainfall falls between June and Sept-
ember during the kharif crop season, when a range of tropical crops are grown
suited to the hot and humid conditions then prevailing. The drier period between
October and February, the rabi crop season, depends largely on irrigation to
grow the more temperate crops. The table below gives some basic rainfall
statistics:

4.      The Ganges plain which covers a large portion of the area is the most
fertile region of India.  The soils are essentially alluvial in character with
recognizable difference, from place to place. They have been subject to culti-
vation for many centuries, and are capable of much higher and sustained yields in
the future, provided heavier fertilizer dressings, improved irrigation, flood
protection and drainage facilities are available.

C. Irrigation
5.        In most areas, there ar'e ample supplies of groundwater of generally
good quality. Because of the heavy rainfalls during the monsoon season, the
groundwater resources receive ample recharge and provide thus the basis for
large future expansions of the existing irrigation system.
.6.        The table below indicates that the States which form Sindri's
intensive marketing area (Bihar, West Bengal, UP), have 25 to 40% of their
net sown areas under irrigation, which compares to an Indian average of about
22%. Given the rich groundwater resources of these areas, there is great po-
tential for increasing the irrigE.ted area and provide year-round irrigation.

D, Cropping Pattern
Of the total cultivated area in these States 65 percent is under
food crops and 8 percent under comtmercial crops. Main food crops grown in
this area are rice followed by wheat, maize, sorghum and millet.
8.        This area has the largevt proportion of cash crops in the country.
Important among the cash crops are jute, sugarcane and tea.  The area under
major crops in the five States is given in the table below:

The high yielding varieties program (HYVP) has made appreciable
sIides in the five States.  The main crops covered under the HYVP are
rice and wheat, and to a lesser extent maize, jower and bajra. In FY 1973,
as much as 9.5 million hectares in these States were under the program. The
progress of the area under the HYVP for different crops in the five States
since FY 1970 is given in the table below:

E. Yield Rates
10.        The major crop in this area is rice.  The average yield of the
mRjor crops continues to be low and can be increased through higher use of
inputs like fertilizer and introduction of better farm practices. The
average yield of some of the rice, wheat, and jute crops in these areas
vis-a-vis that of some of the agriculturally more advanced States for
financial years 1962 and from 1968 -;o 1972 is given in the following table
which gives a comparative position.

ii.        It can be seen from the table that there has been an appreciable
increase in yield rates of food grains in this area.  The increases in yield
rates were largely due to progressive improvement in agricultural practices
such as intensive cropping, use of high yielding variety seeds, fertilizers,
pesticides, improved irrigation, etc.
12.        The use of fertilizers in these States have been increasing rapidly
in recent years. This may be seen from the following table which gives the
per hectare consumption of fertilizers in this area during FY 1962, FY 1969
and FY 1973.

13.       The per hectareuse of tertilizer in these States, it may been
seen, continues to be even below the national average except in the case
of U.P.   is the national average itself is very low, in comparison to
other countries, (See table belou) the potential for increased use of
fertilizers is very large.

INDIA: SINDRI FERTILIZER PROJECT
MARKETING SINDRI' S NITROGENOUS FERTILIZER PRODUCTION
A.  Past and Present Demand and Supply in Sindri's Marketing Area
1.        The Sindri Unit of the Fertilizer Corporation of India was the
first major fertilizer unit in the country. Because of this it was
necessary for Sindri, in the early years of its establishment, to distribute
its products over a wide area.
2.        As Sindri's products gained popularity in many distant areas, it
was difficult for the Corporation to withdraw its marketing operations from
such areas as and when fertilizer availability improved there. This was
roarticularly so for the reason that the Corporation had large-scale
exoansion programs in most of these states and sudden withdrawal of such
operations from these areas would have adversely affected the Corporation's
image.
3.        However, as products became available from other units of the
FCI, the Corporation has gradually reduced its marketing activity to areas
nearer to producing units to a large extent. From the table given below,
it may be seen that about 80% of Sindri's present production in terms of
'N' is now sold in the economic marketing area of Sindri, i.e., in the
States of Bihar, West Bengal, Orissa, U.P., and M.P.
4.        This is so for all products except double salt, which traditionally
has found. a market in the distant States of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra,
and Cujarat. Double salt continues to be supplied to these relatively
distant areas on account of the specific suitability of the product for the
soil and crops there.
There has been, however, an increase in recent years in the off-
take of double salt in Bihar and nearby States which trend, if kept up,
will help in further confining Sindri's market to nearby areas.

8.        fvram the above table it becomes clear that a significant amount
of' fertilizer had to be imported fran producers in other Indian States
and from sources outside India to meet the deficit arising from insufficient
Droduction in the five States hetre considered. Uttar Pradesh has had, by
far, the largest deficits followed by Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal which
has hardly any manufacturing facilities at all.  Bihar was self-sufficient
up to FY 1971, but has become a deficit State in the last two years
largely because of the lower output from the Sindri unit.

10.       As for future supplies within these States, some of the existing
units have plans for expansion and, in addition, there are a number of new
projects which are expected to be commissioned by FY 1979.  An analysis of
the production perfoimance of the existing units in these states shows
that it has been of the order of about 60%. Most of these units are old
Plants and cannot be expected to produce any better. Hence, it is assessed
that the existing units will utilize their capacity in future years to the
same extent as now.  As for the new uni',s it is assumed that they will
produce at 50 per cent of their capacity in the first year, 75 per cent
in the second year, and 90 per cent in the third year and thereafter. On
this basis, the likely production of nitrogenous fertilizer during the
financial years 1978 to 1980 in the five States will be as shown in the
following table:

12.       Thus, even when all tae expansion programs both under construction
and envisaged are on stream the-re would, by 1980, still be a shortfall in
the overall availability of nitrogenous fertilizer in the States included
in Sindri's marketing area. Berond 1980, this shortfall will further
increase due to an anticipated 2urther increase in demand which will
require the construction of add:Ltional plants.
13.       As in the past, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh are
projected to remain deficit States, while West Bengal and Orissa are
expected to be in a surplus position.  Orissa, in particular, will have
significant excess production ontce the Talcher and Paradeep plants start
operations. Both of these plants have been planned so as to minimize the
transport of raw materials. Talcher will be a coal-mine-mouth plant and
Paradeep will receive its oil from the new deep-sea port and refinery
complex planned there.
114.      The large number of plants and the different demand and supply
position of the States belonging to the Sindri marketing area make it
difficult to determine the likely distribution pattern of Sindri's
products. One study done by the FCI assumes that the distribution pattern
is only affected by economic distance which gives producers an advantage
in the markets close to their plants. The assumption is also made that
competitors will not experience difficulties in selling their products
in their own markets, that competitors will have the same production costs
as Sindri and that no fertilizer will be sold below its production costs.
Under such simplifying assumptioas, the likely distribution pattern in
1979/80 would be as follows:

15.       The distrioution pattern reflects the competition from the
various olants in the Sindri marketing area, which forces the Sindri
Production to be marketed beyond a 750 km radius.  Beyond 1979/80,
nowever, the share of production marketed outside the secondary market
is likely to become smaller because of anticipated further increase in
demand in Sindri's primary and secondary market.
16.       It should be observed that most likely a different distribution
pattern would result by using assumptions different from the ones
described above. Because of the fact that by 1980 FCI plants are expected
to account for 80% of the total production in the Sindri marketing area,
FCI can greatly affect the distribution pattern of all the fertilizer
sales in the five States, and thus also of the individual plants.  To
develop a distribution pattern which could minimize FCI's distribution
costs a complex study would have to be undertaken which would take into
account the production costs of the various plants, storage requirements,
rail and road transportation costs, district-wise demand for fertilizer,
the activities of FCI's competitors, the sources of raw materials, and
many other factors. Such a study would be of great complexity and cannot
be expected in the near future. However, even without such a study, it
becomes clear, from the data presented above, that Sindri should have no
difficulty in marketing most of its nitrogenous fertilizer production in
nearby markets, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, where it is expected that
a significant fertilizer deficit wlll persist.
C. Transport
17.       Sindri is well connected with all parts of the country by rail on
broad-gauge. The analysis of the data on movement of fertilizers from
Sindri's unit in the past has shown that the bulk of the quantities produced
at Sindri is moved by rail. The situation is now changing and the Govern-
ment of India, in order to avoid congestion on railways is insisting that,
as a policy, nearby areas to all producing units should be served by road.
18.       The present policy of the Fertilizer Corporation is also to
encourage as far as practicable movement of fertilizer within a radius of
150 to 200 kmi, by road. By the time the Sindri project is in full pro-
duction, it is anticipated that about 15 per cent of the production will
be moved by road, reducing the congestion on railways.
19.       The past and estimated future mode of transportation is given
on the following page:

D. Storage
20.       The storage requiremenl; for the Sindri project has been worked
out taking into account the tota- likely production and the month-to-month
variation in demand for fertilizers. It will not be necessary to have
godowns for meeting sales requirements in nearby areas as the Corporation's
policy is to meet all the sales in such areas within six weeks of placing
the orders and directly from the factory. The buffer godown requirement in
distant areas would be:

E. Distribution and Sales
21.       FCI's dealership network includes both cooperatives and private
dealers. As for cooperatives, mainly the Apex level societies are the
dealers who distribute through their large network of lower level
cooperative units. In the case of private dealers the policy is to
encourage small dealers handling about 500 to 1,000 tons a year.  There
is also a scheme under which the Corporation has appointed a number of
educated young men as its dealers after giving them preliminary training
in fertilizer sales.  Most of these young men are agricultural graduates
who are equipped to render better service to farmers of their area.
The total number of dealers in each of the five States is as under:
Cooperatives/ 1

I/ The institutional buyers shown here include only the Apex organization.
There are hundreds of outlets under Apex institutions through which the
Apex institutions distribute the fertilizers.
22.       The sales through the cooperative channels have always been
substantial. The percentage share of distribution through cooperativea
and other institutional buyers in the Sindri's marketing area during
FY 1973 for different products was as under:
Product                    % Share of the Coop.
and Institutional Buyers
Urea                                 52

A.N.P.                               95
23.       More emphasis is now being given for distribution through
cooperatives now as the Corporation has taken a policy decision in July,
1973, that in each State a minimum of 50% of the sales should be through
cooperatives.



ANNEX 3-3
Page 12
F. Credit
24.       The Corporation's policy at present is to sell, as far as possible,
fertilizer against cash payment. In certain areas, however, one month's
fully secured credit is extended to institutional agencies.
25.       In addition, to credit extended directly, FCI also helps dealers
to obtain distribution credit from commercial banks.
26.       In each district there is a lead bank, which is one of the
nationalized banks and the objectives of these lead banks are to promote
agricultural credit.
27.       The farmers can also obtain loans directly from the cooperatives.
The cooperatives at Apex level can, in turn, obtain loans from the State
Banks or from the Central Reservel Bank of India. Typical interest terms
are:
Reserve Bank to Cooperatives                 6.5%
State Bqnk to Cooperative                    9.0%
Cooperatives to Farmers                      9.5%
State Bank to Farmers                      10.0%
28.       Ioans to farmers are usually made on a seasonal basis, i.e., for
six months or one year, and are granted according to the farmers ability
to produce rather than his securable assets. The small farmers are
helped by the Small Farmers Development Agency and the Marginal Farmers
Development Agency. These agencies are intended to provide 100% financing
to about one million people at h% annual interest basis. Twenty-five per
cent of these funds will come from Agencies sources and the remaining from
Cooperatives.
G. Market Research and Sales Pronotion
29.       FCI's marketing operations are supported by active marketing
research by a competent group of personnel who have knowledge Uoth of the
field and modern techniques of marketing research. There are marketing
research cells both at headquarters and in the various regional zones.
The Eastern and Northern MarketiAng Zones have research managers who
report the results of various studies undertaken to the Zonal Managers of
the respective zone. As the quanbity to be marketed in Sindri's
marketing area will increase sizeably with the expansion, the activities
of the Marketing Research Wings he3re will also increase.
30.       The Corporation's selling programs are supported by massive
promotional efforts. FCI has a till-fledged Agricultural Research and
Fertilizer Promotion Wing which i3 staffed 'by competent agricultural
scientists belonging to disciplines like agronomy, soil science and
agricultual extension.  This Wing has research laboratories at Sindri,
Trombay, and Durgapur, which work in close collaboration with the State
Agricultural Department.

INDIA - SINDRI FERTILIZM? PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTYL-a
A. Process Description
The Sindri Ammonia/uraa pro'ect will have a daily capacity of
900 metric tons anmonia  (297,000 TPY) and 1,000 metric tons urea (330,COC
TPY) with the excess ammonia (31S TPD) being used mainly fer the production of
Amrionium Sulphate. The following description is generally as given in the
Nangal Fertilizer Project/Appraizal Report (L,6-Th). The project includes a _Ne7l
oil gasification unit based on -ne Shell process, in which heavy petroleum
fractions are partially oxidize(d with oxygen and heat recovered as steam.
Gasification is followed by a Liirgi-Rectisol unit for desulfurization and
decarbonation and final traces of impurities are removed in a nitrogen
wash unit.  The synthesis gas is compressed and fed to the ammonia synt"es-s
section for conversion to ammoni.a over synthesis catalyst.  The cx-ygen f 'r
gasification and nitrogen for thLe nitrogen wash are obtaire-. from an al-
fractionation plant. Ammonia arid carbon dioxide are fed1 to the un-- ea pl- t
which is based on the total recycle process of lontecatir-4_dison for the
production of prilled urea. The plant sections are descrribed in gre;lter
detail below.
B. Feedstock
The project is based cn the use of heavy petroleum fraction.
from the Indian Oil Corporation's Barauni refinery as the feedstoek.
Fuel oil is shipped by rail, and loading and unloading require the t:nk
wagons to be steam-heated.  Afte2 heating, the oil is pum,ped to two steari-
heated storage tanks (12.500 kiloliters each, which correspond to about 30
days feedstock requirement).  Unloading facilities can handle sixty tank w-s,,ons
per day.
C. Fuel Oil Gasification
Shell's non-catalytic p:artial oxidatlon process with total recycle
of carbon is used.  It includes Three gasifiers. eachl with a ratei capai-ity
of 700,000 Nm3 per hour of product gas (CO + H25.  Oxygen (CB  92  _rc-f the
air fractionation plant is compressed tc 56 atm and precleated to  f1002.
Fuel oil, with recycle carbon di:ipersed in it, is preheated to 21A0OOC f1-
piuped to the combustor guns on 7;op of the gasifiers.  The combustor gurs
also receive oxygen and steam.  P'eedstock reacts with oxygen and stein! in t!ne
flame below the combustor to yield a gas rich irn carbon monoxide and hydrogen.
The gas is low in methane and coriteins sulfur as hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
and a small quantity of organic l:ulfur (COS).  About 3% of the carbon presert
forms soot, or solid carbon, which is recycled.  Hot gas from the reactor
flows into a waste heat boiler which adjoins the reactor shell. The waste
heat boiler design allows gas to pass through without soot deposition or the
neat exchange surface. Heat fron the gas is recovered in the waste heat boiler
to generate steam at 100 atm.  Gas from the waste heat boiler is ouenched with
recirculating water and further scrubbed in a packed carbon scrubber.  Carbon
discharges from the quench systeR as a slurry and it is pelletized by agitation
with fuel oil. Carbon pellets are separated from water by screening and
then suspended in fuel oil and recycled to the gasifier.

D. Rectisol Wash (Sulfur Removal)
The Rectisol process (Lurgi), which uses methanol for the physical
absor-tfor of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), organic sulfur (COS) and carbon dio-
xiAe ((0X) is used in the gas purification section. Gas from the gasific-
ation section with 0.8% H2S and 0.02% COS at 46 atm and N5°C is mixed with
gas fromi the HoS tower and C02 absorber. It is cooled by indirect heat
exchange with evaporating ammonia and the outgoing gas before entry into the
H2S absorber at -35°C.  The H2S and COS content is reduced to about 0.1'
ppm by washing with methanol at -L9°C. From the bottom of the absorber the
rich methanol passes to the H2S tower, where it is evaporated in two stages.
Gas from the first stage, which contains H2 and C0, is compressed along with
the gas from the 002 albsorber and mixed with incoming gas from the gasification
section. Liquid from the tower is regenerated in the H2S regenerator.
iquid from the regenerator whlich contains methanol and water, is pumped to the
methanol distillation column to recover methanol.  A methanol and water sol-
uti^n obtained by scrubbing out the C02 gas to go to the Urea plant is fed
to the distillation column.  The methanol vapor and gas from the distillatior
column is mixed with H23 regeneration gas and cooled in heat exchangers from
55°C to about 100C to condense the methanol vapor, which then can be used
as reflux for the H2S regeneration.  The H2S is then processed to recover
sul fur.
. Shift Conrersion
A-fter sulphur removal, the gas is treated to convert all carbon
,onoxide to hydrogen.  The process utilizes the high temperature carbon mono-
xide conversion catalyst manufactured by the P & D Division of FCI.  This
catalyst is in comnercial operation in several plants including Sindri,
Trombay, 3"nrup and I-eveli.  The catalyst is arranged in  three beds with
cooling between them.  After the second and third beds heat is removed by
'?xchange with the gas entering the first bed.  After the first bed, heat
is recovered for pre-heating boiler feed water. The gas leaving the shift
onvers-or section contains 2.5 CC.
.ar'c on 2Dioxide ?Remova-
Gas from shift conversion which contains about 34  00  and C.3
'l1i'2S  cd 03OS, enters the absorption refrigeration system at i900C and
' tm  rad is cooled to -25°0.  Cooled gas enters the C02 absorber, i-here
' is reduced to less than 10 ppm. Gas from the absorber goes to the
nitrogen wash unit.  iethanol from the C02 regenerator is fed back to the
'½72 absorber for C02 removal.  The 002 rich methanol is flashed in stage and
n.lly stripped with impure nitrogen fromi the air separation plant, in the
202 regenerator.  The bulk of hydrogen absorbed in the methanol will come
o£f in the first stage. This stream is recylced to the H12S removal section.
Carbon dioxide obtained from the regeneration column is sent to the Urea
pli,nt. The methanol is regenerated by stripping with impure nitrogen which
eaz'riLes vitb i.w 'he i-erdaning C02.

G. Nitrogen Wash
Gas leaving the Rectisol washing section is processed in the
nitrogen wash plant for final purification, before entering the syrthes'-s
loop.  The process gas leavirg -he Rectisol decarboration section is cooled
to _1900C. Nitrogen is cooled .o -190°C and is utilized in tile liuili
nitrogen unit for scrubbing the gas.  Gas leaving the unit is a nitrogel--
hydrogen mixture (ammronia synthesis gas) which contains less than X pp,m of'
carbon monoxide.
H. Anmonia Synthesis and Sto,rage
Synthesis gas frorl the! nitrogen wash unit at 38 atm ancd 350. is
compressed in a four stage centrifugal compressor driven by a stean turline.
The gas is compressed to 235 atrm in three stages after which the ree  e
gas from the synthesis loop is cdded and the total gas compressed to 27C0 :Ln
and 1.60C.  The catalyst in the convertor is arranged in three layers.  Tlho
entering gas excl.-nges heat withl the outgoing hot gas and enters the 'irsl
catalyst bed at about 50o°C. Waste heat is recovered after the first two
stages by producing steam at 1CC atm.  Gas from the last cataly-st ber1 ron-
taining about 1c,  amm.onia is cocled. by excharge wit. the ineorrirg gas ance
leaves the converter at 880C.  Amrionia is cooled and condensed in two stares
in a water-cooled condenser and ammonia-cooled condensor.  The condense"
ammonia is separated and the renfainirg gas which contains about 3.3  17>
is recycled to the recirculator.  Armonia from the condersors is flas'e z-c
about 22 atin and then sent to storage.
I. Air Fractionatiorn
Oxygen for partial oxidation and nitrogen for the nitroger scru'-
bing unit and nitrogen for synthesis gas are obtained from an air fr-(u'iLor,-
tion plant.  Air  s compressed and cooled to about -1y00C and ox-ygen mc
nitrogen are separated in a distillation column.  The unit produces (>
pure oxygen and r-itrogen with not more tha- 20 ppm oxy-gen ar-i 100 ppm -argor.
J.  Urea SZEthesis and Priling
*Jrea production will be based on the modified Montedison totcl
recycle urea process.  Ammonia aid carbon dioxide are cormlpressed at I fed
to the reactor operating at 21C0 atm and 2000C.  Part of the cirbon (.7 oxide
is taken off at an intermediate stage of the conpressor at 80 atn andI sent
to the first condersor.  The solution from the reactor which1 consist,s of
urea, water, axmnonium carbainate and amioni:. is sent to the first distiller
where most of the carbamate is deconposed at 60 atm and 15C0C int'! armmoria
and carbon dioxide and. most of the excess armmon:la is evaporated.  Due to ti;e
high ratio of arimonia to carbon dioxide used ir the syster, the de o2;posi`::::
of the carbamate proceeds to 1-ts ecuilibriumi.  The effluent from t'he first
distiller enters the separator, :-r. which liouicl and vapor separate.  The
vapor enters the first condensor and iis partially condensed as arir.oria anc.

The solution produced in the first condenser is recycled to the
reactcr througln a carbamiate pumy.  The urea solution separated in the first
separator passes through a second distiller and second separator operating
at about 12 atr.  Gas to the second condenser is condensed as an aqueous
solution and then recycled to the first, condenser.  The urea solution passes
to t4e third distiller and separators. which operate at X,. atm, to yield a
'ureA soh;.-tior.  The gas separated at this stage is condensed and recycled
to the second stage condenser.
Urea soluticn is concentrated in two stages operating inder vacuux;.
The gas effluent from the first stage is condensed and armmonia recovered
fror the solutior in a rectification colunn and recyclei.  From the second
st,-ge F5.7?f mo',ten urea is obtained wh)ich is sprayed into the prilling tower
to convert urea into spheres or "prills".

INDIA: SINDRI r'ERTILIZER PROJECT
RENOVATION PROGRAM
1.        Concurrently with the implementation of the Triple Superphosphate
Project currently under construction (known as the Rationalization Scheme)
and with the implementation of the proposed new Ammonia/Urea project, the
FCI will undertake a Renovation program primarily applied to those plants and
facilities which will remain in operation as an integral part of the modernized
Sindri works. This program is essential to the successful operation of the new
Ammonia/Urea project but will not be considered as part of this project and
consequently its cost is not contained in the project cost estimate or the
financing plan. The capital cost of this scheme, however, is included in the
financial projections and in the computation of financial rate of return.
2.        At its 155th meeting held on December 2, 1972, the FCI Board of
Directors approved a long-term Renovation Scheme to cost Rs 100.4 million.
However, since then the decision has been taken to retire the coke oven plant
on completion of the new Ammonia/Urea project and so the cost has been re-
estimated in a FCI Board paper of April 27, 1974 at Rs 84.31 million.
3.        Set out below is the presently estimated cost of the entire renova-
tion program. The cost of renovation of existing plant which will continue in
operation after modernization of the works remains at Rs 84.31 million.
However, in addition it is now planned to install an additional steam boiler,
modify the 400 TPD sulphuric acid plant to eliminate excessive pollution and
make provision for replacement of existing plant and equipment which may become
necessary during the commercial operating period of the new Ammonia/Urea project.
The table does not show the cost of renovation of plant and equipment which will
be retired on completion of the new project. This cost is estimated at an
additional Rs 8 million but is not connected with the project and may be regarded
as maintenance.

INDIA: SINDRI FERTILIZER PROJECT
WORKS TRANSFORMATION AND ENVIRONM TAL STUDY
TERMS OF REFERENCE
1.          Background
1.1         The Sindri Fertilizer Works, a manufacturing unit of the Fertilizer
Corporation of India (FCI), hereinafter called the Corporation, was the first
major chemical fertilizer works to be established in India. It is situated on
the West Bank of the Damodar River about 15 miles from Dhanbad in the State of
Bihar and currently has an installed capacity of 320,000 tons per annum (TPA)
Ammonium Sulphate, 71,500 TPA Double Salt (Ammonium Sulphate Nitrate), 21,000 TPA
Urea, and 9,000 TPA explosive grade Ammonium Nitrate.  Additionally a plant for
the production of 346,o0o TPA Triple Superphosphate (TSP) is presently under
construction and is due for completion in 1975.
1.2        Construction of the works commenced in 1948 with the installation of
a 274 ton per day (TPD) Ammonia plant based on the gasification of purchased
Coke, and a 974 TPD Ammonium Sulphate plant according to the Merseberg process
using naturalmined gypsum supplied fiom West Punjab. The works which also
included an 80 MW steam power plant was completed by the end of 1950 and success-
ful commercial production of Ammonium Sulphate commenced from October 1951.
1.3         The first expansion of the works involving the construction of a 60
oven Coke battery with auxiliary equipment was completed in 1954 and made the
works independent of supplies of Coke brought in from nearby steel works.  A
second expansion of the works followed soon afterwards and became operative in
1959.   This involved construction of an additional 189 TPD Ammonia plant, a 406
TPD Ammonium Sulphate Nitrate plant, and a 71 TPD Urea plant with the Coke oven
gas production from the first stage expansion being used as feedstock for the
additional Ammonia production; and newly installed lean gas plant supplying fuel
for firing the Coke ovens. In March, 19693 a small naphtha reforming plant was
commissioned with a production equivalent to 60 TPD Ammonia, which served to
augment the production of Coke oven gas that had necessarily had to be reduced to
maintain Coke quality. A fourth expansion completed in 1970 involved the installa-
tion of a 400 TPD Sulphuric Acid plant based on pyrites and while not increasing
the output of Sulphates from the works had become necessary to augment supplies of
-ypsum which were now being taken from Rajastham and were steadily decreasing in
purity.
1.4         The present facilities for the production of Ammonia and Urea there-
fore consist of a large number of small scale plants based on obsolete process
technologies and for which much of the equipment is approaching the end of its
useful working life. Additionally, the Ammonium Sulphate unit is suffering
from the disadvantage of continually deteriorating quality of mined gypsum supplies



ANNEX4-
Page 2
worsened by increasing transportation costs, and uncertainty of supplies.  in
order to alleviate these problems the Corporation has already embarked on a
Rationalization programt involving the constructicn of a new 800 TPD Sulphuric
Acid plant, a 390 TPD Phosporic Acid plant according to the Prayon process,
and a 1150 TPD TSP plant based on the Corporation's own technology.  These uni+ts
which are expected to commence commercial production by mid 1975, will add
3h6,000 TPA TSP to the works capaclty and additionally produce as a by-product
from the phosphoric acid plant suf:ficient quantities of precipitated gypsum to
meet the full requirements of the Ammonium Sulphate unit.
1.5         In addition to the Rat:Lonalization program already underway the
Corporation proposes to make an imiediate start on a modernization proJect
involving the construction of a 90() TPD Ammonia plant based on the partial oxida-
tion of heavy oil and a 1,000 TPD total recycle Urea plant.  This project which
is   scheduled for completion in 1!:77 will supply all Ammonia requirements of the
existing Ammonium Sulphate and Ammonium Nitrate plants and will thus permit the
retirement at that time of all the present small scale and now obsolete Coke oven,
gasification, Ammonia synthesis andl Urea units. In addition the production of
double salt will be discontinued. The rated output of the iforks after moderniza-
tion will be 320,000 TPA Ammonium 8'ulphate, 330,000 TPA UTrea and 346,000 TPA
TSP.
1.6         Concurrently with the imolementation of the Rationalization and
Modernization projects, the Corporc.tion will undertake a rehabilitation and
Renovation program under which the existing power plant, the Merseberg process
Ammonium Sulphate unit and other utilities and services installations forming a
necessary part of the modernized wcrks will be completely overhauled and necessary
replacements effected.
1.7          Appreciating that the tasic characters of the works will be completely
transformed by the rationalization and modernization projects, the Corporation
wishes to undertake a transformation and environmental study having as its
objective the formulation of a plan to modernize all aspects of the presert opera-
tions of the works concurrently with the installation of the new plant facilities,
so that maximum benefits may be derived from the rebuilding of the works and the
changeover may be effected on the most economic, efficient and beneficial manner.
2.          General Terms of Reference
It is envisaged that the study will cover four fundamental areas
namely, Environmental and Pollution; Manning, Systems and Safety; Works replanning;
and labor utilization.



ANNEX 4-4i
Page 3
2.1         Environmental and Pollution
2.1.1       This section of the study will cover a general survey of the emissions
and waste streams from the existing units and a review of the means to be provided
for handling effluents from the new facilities included under the rationalization
and modernization schemes. As an indication the following types of effluents,
emissions, and general ecolcgical problems are to be found in connection with the
existing units.
Ammonium Sulphate Plant
Some Ammonium Sulphate is contained in the liquid effluent from the
plant, and some Ammonia is lost to atmosphere in the carbonation section. A dust
problem sometimes occurs in the gypsum grinding section and some fine Ammonium
Sulphate particles are unrecovered from the cyclone separation unit.  Additionally
arsenic compounds are used as corrosion inhibitors in the evaporation section.
Nitric Acid Plant
Some oxides of nitrogen are emitted into the atmosphere and the plant's
licuid effluent contains some Amnonium nitrate and Nitric Acid.
Steam Generation Plant
A dust and ash disposal problem exists and some smoke is emitted
into the atmosphere.
Semi Water Gas Plant
A considerable dust problem exists arising from the intermittent
emission of unburnt Coke and ash during the blow run.
Ammonia Plants
Some Ammonia vapours may be lost into the atmosphere and the liquid
effluent contains some dissolved Ammonia, Alkali, oil from the gas compressors,
and some copper compounds used in the removal of carbon monoxide from the
synthesis gas.
Coke Oven Battery
Dust presents a problem within the coal crushing plant and consider-
able emission of dust and gas occurs when coal is charged to the ovens.



ANNEX h-L
Page 4
Coke Oven Gas Purification
The liquid from the coke oven gas scrubbers contains Ammonia, phenol,
cyanides and sulphates.  Washings from the Benzol plant, overflow of Ammonia
scrubber seal pots, and tarry matter are additional hazards containing Ammonia,
oil, cyanides, phenols and organic matter.
400 TPD Sulphuric Acici Plant
A severe dust problem exists in the handling, crushing and screening
of pyrites.  Being a single conversion process, considerable amounts of Su'-har
oxides are discharged into the atmosphere and the liquid effluent sometiries eon-
tains week acid. Additionally acid sludge is occasionally discharged fror T:hc
plant.
2.1.2       In making its survey cf the ecological characteristics of the existing
units and the nature and method of disposal of the works effluents, the stud,, team
should make full use of the data, measurements, and other technical information
already available within the Corpcration, and should identify any additional
measurements and tests that may be necessary.  The  study team should also examine
the specifications of theplants to be constructed under the rationalization and
modernization programs, identify the likely sources and nature of noxious effluents
and emissions, and examine the means provided either to recycle or dispose of them,
as well as the effect these plants will have on the effluent from the works as a
whole.
2.1.3       Based on its survey, the study team should recommend any modifications
or revised operating procedures that should be adopted and any additional investi-
gatory work that should be undertaken in order to ensure acceptable ecological
standards are met. In this connection it may be noted that tolerance limits for
industrial effluents discharged into inland surface waters are set forth in
Indian Standard No. 2490. At present, although a draft has been prepared, there
is no statutory Indian Standard for atmospheric emissions and in this and other
such cases typical US or Euronearn Standards should be adopted.
2.1.4       In making its recommenlations as per 2.1.3 above, the study team
should take appropriate account of the plan for early retirement of many of the
existing units (See Para. 1.5) and the scope of the rehabilitation and renovation
programs to be applied to those units which will remain in service (See Para.
1.6). Additionally, during the co-irse of its survey and particularly in the for-
mulation of its recommendations thE study team should consult as appropriate wnth
the Corporation's own Internal PolLution and Environment Committee.
2.1.5       The study team should also recommend any desirable revisions in the
specifications of new plant to be built under the modernization scheme, or modifi-
cations to plant presently being constructed under the rationalization program,
to achieve the standards outlined lmder 2.1.3.  In this phase of its work the
study team should additionally con3ult as appropriate with the groups within the
Corporation responsible for these projects.



ANNEX  -
Page 5
2.1.6       Following definition of the measures to be taken as under 2.1.3 -
2.1.5 above, the study team should prepare an estimate of the total cost involved
suitably itemized and delineated into local currency and foreign exchange, and
the likely time schedule for completion. Additionally a plan of execution should
se proposed aimed at achieving the most rapid results consistent with the objec-
,ive of minimum cost and interruption to manufacturing schedules.
2.2 2Manning, Systems, and Safety
2.2.1       This section of the study will basically cover an analysis of the
manning requirements of the new production facilities compared to those of the
existingunits, and the suitability of theexisting and pLanned maintenance facili-
ties for the servicing of the modernized works.  Examination of other auxiliary
services such as transportation, materials management, packaging, utilities
supplies etc. will not form part of this study. The objective of the study will
be to prepare a plan for reorganizing the manning, and works maintenance services
smoothly and efficiently. Additionally this section of the study will aim at
outlining the safety standards and procedures which should be adopted for the new
production facilities and for this purpose will recommend any desired changes in
the standards and procedures currently in use on the existing facilities.
2.2.2       The works presently employ 2209 staff on production, aid 2111 on plant
maintenance services as itemized below:

On completion of the modernization project, production units presently employin,
approximately 1000 operators will te shut down and replaced by a new  O00  TPD
modern technology centrifugal compressor type Ammonia plant and a 1000 T?D total
recycle Urea plant. The operators required for these new plants should therefore
be drawn to the maximum extent possible from the available surplus and an in-
depth study of how best to effect this reorganization is required as described
in the following paragraphs.
2.2.3       The study will assess the needs of the new production plants included
under the modernization project in terms of the numbers and types of skilled and
unskilled operators required, and the type and extent of training that should be
given and its duration will be included, leading up to a time schedule for the
deployment of the necessary operational labor force onto the new project. In
assessing the Manning strength of the units, the Consultants should pay anpro-
priate regard to the prevailing Industrial labor practices in India.
2.2 .4      The study team will simaltaneously examine the numbers, classification
and experience of staff presently enployed on the existing production units
identifying the most suitably qualiCied and experienced groups for reassignment
to the new facilities and the most suitable categories to receive specialized
training. The study team shall thea be required to formulate a plan of effecting
this redeployment so as to fully satisfy the requirements of the new project while
at the same time causingminimum disruption in production and most importantly
avoiding the need to supplement the total number of staff presently employed.  The
plan ultimately formulated should i7lclude detailed analyses of the alternatives
evaluated and be sufficiently detaiLed so that unforeseen complications whcen It is
put into effect may be avoided.
2.2.5       A similar assessment of the W4ork's present and planned maintenance
capability in terms of skilled labor, workshop facilities and spare parts control
shall be made by the study team, in the coritext of its suitability and capacity to
efficiently serve the modernized works inclusive of all remaining operational
facilities after completion of the modernization project. The team shall recommend
any changes in this maintenance operation which it deems necessary and shall addi-
tionally make an estimate of cost should additional maintenance equiDment be con-
sidered necessary.



ANNEX 4_h
Page 7
2.2.6       In formulating the recommendations required under paras 2.2.4 and
2.2.5 the study team should pay appropriate regard to the integration of the
pro-osed olan into the remaining activities and operations of the works as a whole,
and if necessary view these supplementary operations as a possible source of the
necessary resources. In carrying out all labor studies, the study team should
closely cooperate with the works management and should not pursue their investi-
gations in this field outside of the works or with the representatives of organi-
zed labor without the management's express permission.
2.3         Works Replanning
2.3.1       The Corporation desires as faras possible to demolish and remove the
obsolete production facilities when they are retired, and restore the vacated
portions of the site to an aesthetic and usable condition. Additionally the
corporation desires to realize the maximum revenue from the sale and disposal of
redundant plant and equipment where this may have a market value.
2.3.2       The study team will therefore make an appraisal of the plant and equip-
ment to be retired to identify those units which may be saleable either as
packaged units (e.g. Air Separation unit) or as broken down into individual com-
ponents, those units which could be worth dismantling for their spare parts, and
-those units which should be scrapped.   This appraisal should include an estimate
of the possible value of the saleable items and the cost of demolition, dismantling
and restoration.
2.3.3       The Corporation wishes to utilize staff presently employed at Sindri
who have become surplus to effect this dismantling, demolition and restoration
work. The study team should therefore identify the number of persons who can
usefully be employed on these activities and the likely period for completion.
2.h         Labor Utilization
2 .Lt.l     The total staff strength of the Sindri Works at the commencement of
the modernization project exclusive of staff engaged on the   modernization
t.roject construction is expected to be 8566 some 1223 of whom  are engaged on
:>ro;iion: services to the town and the Corporation's nearby Planning and Develop-
:''ent De?artinent.  The Corporation's prime objective for the modernization project
is -that it be efficiently staffed and operated so as to achieve maximum output
of fertilizer at minimum cost. In order to achieve this object and to avoid the
emergence of inefficient labor, operational and maintenance practices on the
facilities, the Corporation is determined that they will not become the medium
for absorbing surplus labor when the existingobsolete units are retired. The
Corporation is equally desirous however that the surplus employees should not be



ANNEX -
Page a
retrenched and accordingly is anxcous to develop programs for their meaningful
and gainful alternative occupation in activities related to the central production
operations at Sindri.  The study shall therefore survey the oossible means whereby
the numbers of staff estimated by the study team to be surplus may be so employed,
in addition to the works Replanning Program described under 2.3 above.
2.i.2       After identifying possible avenues of alternati-ve occupation of the
estimated surplus labor, the study team shall prepare a plan of implementation
of the scheme or schemes proposed consistent with the ongoing manufacturing and
other activities of the works and inclusive of implementation time schedule and
anticipated costs and benefits.
3,          Requirements of the Study Team
3.L         L is anticipated that the study team shall spend at least one month
at the Sindri Works gathering data and informnation and making first hand observa-
tions. Therefore, it is envisaged that the team's final report, including all
plans, recommendations and supporting information will be completed within three
monLhs. Fifty copies of the report shall thereupon be submitted to the
Corporation.

fNDIAt SINLRI FERTILIZER PROJECT                  A       6-1
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT    Page 1
1.        For preparation of incremental financial projections for the
project the following assumptions were made. All revenues and costs were
escalated to 1978 and kept constant thereafter. The inflation rates used
are 12%, 8%, 6%, and 2.5% (six months only) for FY 1975-1978   Costs and
prices are in the following givea in FY 1975 Rupees to which the above
inflation rates are applied.
A. Capacity and Capacity Utilization
2.        It is assuned that the plants built under the project will start
commercial operations on FebruarY 1, 1978. During the first twelve months
a 70% utilization is assumed which increases to 80 and 90% in the second
and third year and stays constan: thereafter.  The economic life of the plant
is assumed to be 12 years. A 901 capacity utilization corresponds to the
following production volumes:
TPY
Urea                 297,000
Ammonium Sulphate    285,000
Ammonium Nxtrate       9,000
Escess ammonia which might be corverted into nitric acid or sold as ammonia
is assumed to be sold as ammonia.
B. Revenues
3.        All revenues are at the ex-factory level and thus do not include
the Government levy, excise duty, wholesale margin, freLght or any other
charges that determine the spread between the ex-factory and the retail
price. The July, 1974 prices are as given below (in Rs/ton):
Product             Ex-factory   Government   Freight   Excise   Dealer's  Retail
Price                     -  Lev  Duty     MarRin    Price
Urea                  1,125           610        35       175         55     2,000
Ammonium Sulphate       578           195        35        92         25       925
Ammonium Nitrate      2, O000          --        --        --         --       --
4.    -  Since the project provideas the ammonia for the ammonium sulphate
and ammonium nitrate, the revenues and costs for these two products are
included in the incremental analysis.  Excess ammonia is amd to be gold
at Rs 2,400 per ton (July 1974 pri,e) and is escalated the same qy as
fertilizer ex-factory prices.  Salas of by-products such as chalk, tar benzol,
etc., are negligible.
C. Operating Costs
a. Fuel Oil
5.        At time of appraisal the, official ex-refinery price for fuel oil
was Rs 605.07 per kilolitre. This, price includes a considerable amount of
duties and taxes most of which arel not being charged if the oil is used for
the production of fertilizer for iwhich only Rs 371.93 per kilolitre (Rs
jl The price for ammonium nitrate is negotiated between FCI and Indian
Explosives Ltd., the sole purchaser of this product from the Sindri unit.



ANNA 6-1

397.96 per metric ton) is charged.  The following FY 1975 fuel oil price
is therefore assumed for Sindri:
Rs per ton
Ex-refinery                398
Rail freight                40
Siding Charges               8
Sindri delivered:          M
6.        The prices above are based on the assumption that about 2/3 of
India's crude oil requirements will come from imports, the remainder coming
from domestic production. At 90% utilization the yearly production of
ammonia would be 267,300 tons requiring 218,200 tons of heavy fuel oil.
This assumes that 816 kg of fuel oil are required for each ton of amonia
produced.
b. Steam Coal
7.        The price for coal delivered to Sindri has recently been increased
and stands now at Rs 65 per ton.
8.        At 90% capacity utilization 503,000 tons of coal would be required
for the project.
C. Bags
9.        Sindri will use domestically produced polyethelene-lined jute
bags. Bag sizes and prices are assumed as follows:
Unit Cost Unit Cost
Bag Size (FT 1975 Rs)(FY 1979 Rs)
Urea                   50 kg      3.55        4.93
Ammonium Sulphate     100 kg      4.80        6.72
Amoniu Nitrate         50 kg      8.60       11.95
d. Maintenance Materials
10.       Cost of maintenance materials is assumed to be about 3% of the
capitalized value of the new plant.
e. Other Operating Expenses
11.       Consumable stores expenses, which are mostly chemicals for treat-
ment of water, are estimated on the incremental water usage required by the
project.
12.       Electricity duty is a duty of Rs 20 (1975) per Mvh payable for
power generated at Sindri's captive power plant.
13.       Selling and administration and other expenses represent FCI staff
estimates.



ANNEX 6-1
Page 3
D. Other Costs
14.      Depreciation is calculated straight line over 12 years equivalent
to 8 1/3% of the capitalized value of the plant.
E. Income Tax
15.      The income tax as shown represents only the increase ordecrease of
the tax liability as caused by the project. Neither the project nor the
Sindriunit pay taxes directly, but taxes are determined and paid at the
corporate level only.
16.      To determine Sindri's tax liability, account has been taken of
Sindri's cumulative losses, which can indefinitely be carried forward and
of a capital cost allowance calculated on the basis of an average 20% declining
balance of the capitalized value of the plant which is allowable under
Indian tax legislation. To calculate the tax liability caused by the project,
the position of Sindri without the project has also been taken into account.
F. Balance Sheets
a. Cash
17.       Cash requirements at Sindri are minimal since the head office of
FCI holds a large cash balance from which any operating unit can draw at short
notice.
b. Accounts Receivable
18.       It is assumed that one month of sales is outstanding in accounts
receivable. This depends very much on the relative supply position of fert-
ilizer.  In 1973, for example, when fertilizer was in extremely short supply,
receivables were only 16 days.
c. Inventory
19.      The breakdown for inventory for the years 1981 and thereafter is
as follows:
(Rs Million)
Spares                                        83
Finished Goods (one month production)         68
Raw Materials (two month supply for
imported, one month for others).            20
Gods in Proress                                1
T7T
d. Transfer Cash Balance
20.       SLndri is transferring al  its surplus cash to the FCI head office
and is in turn drawing fro  its b     e  hen it requires additional cash.
No interest is gained on a positive balance and none paid when the balance
is negative. The transfer cash balance here is used for balancing assets
and liabilities.



ANNEX 6-1

e. Gross Fixed Assets
21.       The capitalized value of Rs 1,306 million corresponds to Rs 1,192
million for the project and Rs 114 million for the renovation program.
f. Construction in Progress
22.       The expenditures for the project and the renovation program are
expected to accrue as follows (Rs Million):
Renovation
Project         Program     Total
During FY 1975             99            29           128
During FY 1976            394            72           466
During FY 1977          1,178            99         1,277
During Fy 1978          1,245           113         1,358
23.       Capitalization would be at startup of commercial operations in
February, 1978.
g. Current Liabilities
2-4.      Sundry creditors are based on FCI staff estimates and are about
10% of the yearly operating costs.
25.       It is assumed that a portion of the initial working capital require-
ment is financed through a Rs 72 million cash credit from the State Bank of
India at an interest rate of 11% p.a.
h. Financing of Fixed Assets
26.       Incremental expenditures amounting to Rs 1,530 million (Rs 1 ,1X16
million for the project plus Rs 114 million for the renovation program) are
assmed to be financed in the following way:
(Rs millions)

G. Definition of Ratios
27.       The financial ratios as given below the fund flow statement are
defined as follows:
Operating Ratio Before Depreciation (OP RATIO BEF DEP) = Cost
of Goods Sold/Total Sales.



ANNEX 6-1
Page 5
Operating Ratio After Depreciation (OP RATIO AFT DEP) =
(Cost of Goods Sold + Depreciation)/Total Sales.
Debt Service Coverage (DEBT SERVICE COV.) = (Income before
interest but after taxes + depreciation)/(interest payments +
loan repayments).
Current Ratio (CUMRENT RATIO) - Current Assets/Current
Liabilities.
Debt/Equity Ratio (DEBT/EQU1TY RATIO) = Total Long-term
Debt/(Total Equity + Total long-term Debt). The figure shown,
if multiplied by 100%, thus gives the percentage of debt with
respect to total financing.
H. Definition of Break-Even Poixnts
28.       The break-even points as given below the fbnd flow statement are
determined as follows:
a. Profit Break-Even
29.       The capacity utilization required to profit-wise break-even in
any one year is determined as follows:
Capacity = (Fixed Costs)/(Sales - Variable costs)
The price level requirel for profit break-even is:
Price Level = (Variable Costs + Fixed Costs)/Sales
30.       The resulting numbers indicate by how much the average capacity
utilization or the average sales realization would have to change to exactly
break-even.
31.       A number of 1.38 for capacity, for example, means that in that
particular year capacity utilizati.on or production would have to increase by
a factory of 1.38 (or by 38%) in order to profit-wise break-even. Likewise
a price level indicator of 0.89, for example, would indicate that the average
sales realization could fall by 11% and the unit would still break even
profit-wise.
b. Cash Break-Even
32.       The formula for determining the capacity and price level break-
even points are the same as for the profit break-even, however, the definition
Of fixed costs is different. Fixed costs here include all fixed cash
expenditures, thus excluding depreciation, but including loan repayments.
33.       The meaning of the indicators is the same as explained above
for profit break-even, here, howevar, the operational cash flow break-even
point is determined.

Notes:
Assumption for production costs are consistent wi'h  thnae    made fcrfinancial analysis of the Sindri unit.  Capacity utilization  is assumed at 90% of design capacity.
All costs are in 1978 Rupees.
Production costs in Rs/ton reflect costs before financial charges, taxes and profits.

INDIA: SINDRI FERTILIZER PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR CALCULATING THE
ECONOMIC RiTE OF RETUEN
A. Economic Costs
1.        All economic costs and benefits are expressed in 1978 Rupees to
calculate the economic rate of return in real prices.
2.        The financial capital cost of the project has been adjusted to
arrive at the economic cost by taking out interest during construction,
duties and sales tax. The unskilled labor portion of local civil works
is estimated to be about 25% of the cost of civil works which amouats to
about Rs 1.5 million or about 0.15% of the total economic capital cost.
Because of the small amounts involved, the unskilled labor portion of
civil works is not shadow priced.

Economic Capital Cost (in current        1.141           il           1.25
Rupees)
3.        The economic cost of the renovation program which has also to be
included in the analysis is conservatively approximated by using the fin-
ancial costs. The program contains a very large number of small items which
makes it difficult to determine the economic costs. The overall cost of the
program is also small in comparison to the capital costs of the project
which means that the error thus introduced in the analysis is very small.
4.        To convert the economic capital cost to 1978 Rupees it is necessary
to escalate the project expenditures from the time of disbursement to 1978.
The following table shows the conversion to 1978 Rupees:

5.        The economic cost of heavy fuel oil is taken as the cost of im-
porting the total volume of oil to India and transporting it to Sindri.
Crude oil (f.o.b.)          $10.90 per barrel
Conversion ratio at
heavy fuel oil to crude
oil price                    0.65 per barrel
Shipping rate for crudle
or heavy fuel oil            0.75 per barrel
Inland transport to Sindri   Rs 55 per ton
With these assumptions the economic cost (in 1978 Rupees) of heavy fuel
oil becomes about $62 per ton (Rs 466 per ton). This compares to the fin-
ancial costs in 1974 of Rs 4X6 per ton which takes into account the consider-
able cheaper domestic production of crude oil.
6.        Steam coal, the second most important raw material input is
domestically produced and is because of high ash and sulphur content con-
sidered non-tradeable commodity. The economic cost thus becomes the marginal
cost of additional production at social costs. The basic adjustments from
the financial costs are for the vnskilled labor content and for transfer pay-
ments which are estimated to total about Rs 7 per ton or approximately 10%
of the 1974 financial cost of Rs 65 per ton. At present, with the coal in-
dustry nationalized only recently, it is difficult to project the level of
likely cost increases in the industry. Here the same escalation rates as
for the financial analysis are assumed resulting in a coal price of about
Rs 75 per ton in 1978.

7.        Other financial operating costs (bags, consumable stores, main-
tenance materials and other fixed costs) have been adjusted downwards by
about 10% to take unskilled labor and transfer payments into account.
B. Economic Benefits
8.        The economic benefits result from the fact that production of
the project win substitute for fertilizer imports required otherwise. The
benefits are thus measured by expected 1978 world-market prices for urea,
ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate and by the expected shipping and
inland transport costs for fertilizer.  In addition, small amounts of ammonia
are assumed to be available for sale. It is assumed that ammonia and urea
would have a 1:1 price relationship by 1978.
9.        The assumption has been made that the three fertilizers wiU have
a rational price relationship to each other, i.e. that are a retail level
fertilizers will have the same price on a nutrient basis. This then requires
that only one product price has to be estimated and the other would automatic-
ally be determined. Because urea is the most widely traded nitrogenous
fertilizer, and the major product of the project, the urea price is estimated
and the price for ammonium sulphate and azmonium nitrate deduced from that.
10.      World urea prices have in the past widely fluctuated and there
are differing estimates for future prices. The selection of an urea price,
however, is of great significance for the economic analysis, since the
economic rates of return of fertilizer projects are very sensitive to the
fertilizer price assumption. At present, it is estimated that the 1978
urea price would likely be around $150 per ton (f.o.b.) and it is here assumed
that it would be $145 per ton of urea ($315 per ton of N). This best
estimate, however, does not reflect the great uncertainty inherent in these
price assumptions and it is mainly for this reason that the economic rate of
return is calculated on a probabilistic basis, which is further discussed
below.
11.       Shipping rates are at present extremely high and there is consider-
able uncertainty whether and to what extent they will decrease in the future.
There is of course also uncertainty about the source of fertilizer exports
which also affects the cost of shipping. Assuming that fertilizer would
be exported from countries close to India, a best estimate of $30 per ton
has been assumed here as the likely 1978 shipping rate, which includes $5
per ton for past fees and handling.
12.       The inlaad transport cost is small in comparison to fertilizer
prices and shipping rates and does hardly affect the analysis. It is asswxed
that on the average Rs 40 per ton would be required to move fertilizer from
the port of entry to Sindri.

fertilizer prices and related costs:

C. Probability Analysig
14.       As mentioned above, the main reason for calculating the economic
rate of return on a Drobabilistic basis is the considerable uncertainty with
respect to futureworldfertilizer prices.  Conventional sensitivity analysis
can show the effect of changing the price assumptions, but it falls short
of expressing judgment on the likelihood of changes in fertilizer prices
and its effects on the economic rate of return.
15.       The basic assumptions about the type and value of distributions
for the variables entering the rate of return calculation are given in
tabular form on page 9 . The table gives IDA's estimate of the likely
variations from the best estimates which were arrived at in consultation
with other staff members.
16.       The escalated cost of the project was broken down into 14 item
md separate estimates were made for the local and for the foreign costs,
which were converted into 1978 costs and were for each year accumulated.
As a result, the economic capital cost of the project is expected to show
the following likelihood of deviating from the best estimate:
Value      Deviation Prom  Cumulative
best estimate   Probability
(Rs million)
1,345          -  8%            5%
1,404          -  4%           24%
1,462          + 0%            50%
1,520          + 4%            76%
1,579          + 8%            90%
1,608          + 10%           95%
17.       As the table indicates., we are about 75% certain that the economic
capital cost of the project wil:l not exceed Rs 1,520 million, which is only
4% higher than the best estimato. A deviation of 8% or higher has only a
chance of 10%. This relatively small range in which the capital costs are
expected to fall is explained by the fact that individual cost items are
quite well known particularly since many cost estimates could be derived from
recent information obtained on the Nangal project. The only major source of
uncertainty are the escalation rates over the next four years, which are
assumed to vary between -50% and +100% of the best estimates.
18.       In addition to the assumptions about individual operating costs,
the analysis also includes an assumption about the likely capacity utilization.
It is estimated that at the worsit, the capacity utilization would be only
90% of the best estimate and wolad at best exceed the best estimate by 5%.
For the years 1981 and beyond the capacity utilization would thus range
between 81% and 94.5% with 90% being the most likely.
19.       The distribution and values of the economic oost of fuel oil are
obtained by sampling from all the relevant variable distributions with the
following result:

57.0              - 8%              13.5%
59.5              - 4%              29.5%

67.0                8%              91.0%
68.2               10%              95.0%
1/ Fuei oil cost delivered to Sindri
20.       The range here is again quite sall with about 75% certaintythat
the deviation from the best estimate will not exceed +h%, and only a 10%
chance that fuel oil would be more than $67 per ton. The explanation is
mainly to be found in the assumption of expected crude oil prices which
are projected to range uniformly between $9.90 and $11.90 per barrel, which
is only about a +10% deviation from the best estimate of $10.90 per barrel.
21*       Steam coal, where there is some uncertainty about future price
levels is assumed to range between Rs 70 to Rs 90 per ton (a -7% to a +20%
deviation from the best estimate of Rs 75 per ton). Other costs are expected
to have a distribution ranging between -5 and +15% of the best estimate.
22.       The greatest uncertainty, is with the assumption of future fert-
ilizer prices. Estimated distributions for the 1978 urea price indicate a
very wide range, starting at about $90 per ton (f .o.b.) for the lowest pos-
sible value to $250 per ton for the highest possible value. Discounting the
extremes, a range between $100 and $200 per ton was assumed with the best
estimate at $145 per ton. Correspondingly ammonium sulphate would range
between $32 and $65 per ton and ammonium nitrate between $70 and $1 hi per ton.
The shipping rate is assumed to vary between $20 and $40 per ton and the
inland transport between Rs 30 and Rs 50 per ton. By also taking the
distribution of the capacity utilization into account, the distribution of
yearly economic benefits of the project for the years 1981 and beyond is
as follows:
Value          Deviation from      Cumulative
(Es million)     best estimate        Probability
477                -20                  5.0
507                -15                 12.0
566                - 5                 41,0
596                + 0                 50.0
626                + 5                 62.5
685                +15                 89.0
715                +20                 95.0
23.       As expected, the range for the benefits is with about + 25% sign-
ificantly above that for the costs. The table indicates that we can be about
75% certain that the benefits will deviate not more than + 15% from the best
estimate.



ANNEX 7-1

D. Results
24.       Taking the cost and benefit streams as given on page 7 , which
represent the best estimates for all the variables concerned, the economic
rate of return becomes about 16%. A slightly lower value, 15%, is obtained as the
mean of the probability distribution determined through a probabilistic
analysis using the inputs as described in C. above.  In addition, probability
sampling also gives the distribution of the economic rate of return as
follows:
Economic Rate of Return        Cumulative Probability
10.0%                       10.0%
12.0%                       25.0%
15.0%                       50.0%
18.0%                       75.0%
20.0%                       90.0%
21.0%                       95.0%
25.       This indicates that thers is only a 10% chance that the project
will return less than 10% and a 25, probability that the return will fall
below 12%. On the other hand, there is a 10% chance that the project's
return will be more than 20%. The project can thus be described as being
economically very attractive, with very little chance that the economic
rate of return will be marginal.
26.       To demonstrate that the wide range in which the economic rates
of return fall is basically determined by the uncertainty associated with
determining the benefits of the prcj ect, a probability analysis was made in
which only the best estimates were used for the beneifts, and all cost
streams were left with their respective uncertainties. The result is
summarized below:
Economic Rate of Return        Cumulative Probability
14.0%                          5%
14.5%                         20%
15.0%                         50%
16.o%                         80%
17.0%                         95%
27.       The possible values fall now in a range of about  3%    compared
to a range of 11% when the benefit imcertainties were included.
