DEFINITIONS
Crude Birth Rate:      Number of live births per year per 1,000 population.
Crude Death Rate:      Number of deaths per year per 1,000 population.
Rate of Natural        Difference between crude birth and crude death rates;
Increase:            usually expressed as a percentage.
Rate of Population     Rate of natural increase adjusted for (net) migration,
Growth:              and expressed as a percentage of the total population
in a given year.
General Fertility      Number of live births per year per 1,000 women, aged
Rate:                 15-49 years.
Age-Specific            Number of live births to women in a given age group
Fertility Rates:     per 1,000 women in the same age group, in a given
year. It is usually calculated for 5-year age groups.
Total Fertility        The average number of children that would be born
Rate:                per woman if she were to live to the end of her
childbearing years, and bear children according
to a given set of age-specific fertility rates.
The Total Fertility Rate often serves as an estimate
of the average number of children per family.
Gross Reproduction     This is the same as the Total Fertility Rate, but
Rate:                refers to the number of daughters a woman would
have under prevailing fertility patterns.
Net Reproduction        The number of daughters a woman would have under
Rate:                prevailing fertility and mortality patterns, who
would survive to the mean age of childbearing.
Infant Mortality       Annual number of deaths of infants under 1 year
Rate:                per 1,000 live births during the same year.
Maternal Mortality      Number of maternal deaths per 1,000 births attri-
Rate:                butable to pregnancy, childbirth, or puerperal
complications (i.e., within six weeks following
childbirth).
Life Expectancy:        Average number of years expected to be lived by
-children born in the same year if mortality rates
for each age/sex group remain the same in the
future.

I. RECENT DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS
1.01      According to preliminary census figures, the population of Egypt in
November 1976 was about 38.2 million, including an estimated 1.4 million
Egyptians who were abroad. The average annual rate of growth of population
increased from 1.1% for the period between the censuses of 1917 and 1927 to
2.5% for the period between the 1960 census and the sample census of 1966,
but fell in 1966-76 to 2.3%, which is still a very high figure.
1.02      Table 1 below shows the crude birth rates (CBR) and crude death
rates (CDR) over the period 1950-76. The CBR fell very slowly from 1950 to
the mid-60s. The fall accelerated around 1965. However, after declining
steadily from 1965 to 1972, the CBR began to rise slightly. The combination
of a rising CBR with a falling CDR in 1972-76 reversed the downward trend of
the rate of natural increase of population, and by 1976 the rate was higher
than in the late 1960s.

1.03      The CBR in Egypt is not particularly high for a developing country,
especially by comparison with neighboring countries: Libya, Morocco, Sudan
and Algeria all have CBRs close to 50 per thousand. The CBR in Egypt is
significantly lower now than a decade ago, one reason being a rising age



of marriage. Among people of the minimum legal age for marriage (16 for
females and 18 for males) and above, the proportion who had never married
increased from about 18% in 1960 to 25% in 1976. For males the increase was
from 24 to 31%, and for females from 12 to 20%. The rising age of first
marriage is a reflection of urbanization, better education (especially among
females), as well as extended military service and the difficulty of finding
housing, especially in urban areas. The apparent reversal of the decline in
the CBR in 1973, however, is very unusual in a developing country. The most
plausible explanation is that at least part of the 1967-73 decline was attri-
butable to mobilization, the extension of compulsory military service and the
displacement of civilians from the war zones during that period, and that
since 1973 Egypt has been experiencing something of a "post-war baby boom."
1.04      A decline in mortality has been widespread in the developing world
in recent years. Life expectancy at birth in Egypt is now about 55 years.
Egyptian mortality is slightly below the average for all North African coun-
tries in which, as a group, mortality is considerably higher than in East Asia
and most of Latin America, slightly lower than in South Asia, and much lower
than in most of the rest of Africa. Infant mortality in Egypt is estimated at
about 116 per 1,000 live births. Mortality in Egypt is higher than might be
expected in a country with a more extensive network of health services than is
normally associated with a per capita gross national product of about US$280
(1976), mainly because of the prevalence of gastro-intestinal diseases result-
ing from poor sanitation.
1.05      The Egyptian population has always been concentrated in less than
four percent of the total area, mostly in the Nile Valley and the Delta. The
density of population in the inhabited area was 1,030 people per square kilo-
meter in 1976--one of the highest densities in the world. A higher proportion
of people live in towns and cities than in most countries at a comparable
stage of development. In 1976, almost 44% of the population was living in
urban areas, compared with 37.4% in 1960 and 40.5% in 1966, although the
absolute number of inhabitants classified as rural increased from about 18
million in 1966 to 20.6 million in 1976.
1.06      The most striking effect of the growth of population is the growing
pressure on cultivable land. Population per square kilometer of cultivated
land increased from about 500 at the beginning of this century to close to
1,400 in 1976, compared with 57 in Libya, 48 in the Sudan, 75 in Tunisia and
165 in Jordan.  Technological innovation in agriculture has meant that the
need for labor in rural areas has not increased proportionately with the
population. There can be little doubt that part of the massive exodus from
the villages to the cities reflects this increasing pressure of population
on cultivable land.
1.07      Population growth has also put a brake on social development al-
though, as exemplified by the health services, much has been achieved in spite



-3-
of this handicap. Enrollment in primary schools, which rose from 46% of the
6 to 11-year olds in 1952-53 to 74% in 1965-66, has since grown very slowly,
reaching 76% in 1976-77. The number of girls in primary school in relation to
the total primary school enrollment in that year was 40%, which implies an
enrollment ratio for girls in primary school of about 61%. The slow growth in
primary enrollment ratios observed over the last decade has resulted partially
from the difficulty of expanding primary school capacity to keep pace with the
increase in the number of children of school age.
1.08      The continuing low level of female education may seriously retard
the decline of fertility, particularly if poor education becomes an obstacle
to female employment. Given the poor prospects for increased employment in
agriculture, Egypt's growing labor force must look largely to the industries
of the urban areas for jobs. The developing countries that have been most
successful in expanding urban employment--principally those in East Asia--have
been able to call on a labor force with a much better basic education than
that in Egypt today. The problem in Egypt is compounded by the rapid growth
of the labor force. The population aged 12-64 (i.e., the population of
working age) is growing at an annual rate of about 2.7%. Moreover, although
the level of female employment has increased significantly in the last ten
years, it is still very low--only about 14% of the total labor force is
female. This is a fairly typical figure for the Middle East, but it compares
with 23% for Latin America, 30% for Asia and 32% for Subsaharan Africa. There
is thus a large potential for increased female participation in the labor
force. Such an increase would be desirable as tending to reduce fertility,
but its immediate effect would be to make the total labor force grow even
faster.
1.09      Table 2 below projects the increase in Egypt's population over the
remainder of the century on the plausible, but nevertheless optimistic,
assumption that the recent upturn in the birth rate is a temporary phenomenon
reflecting demobilization, and that the downward trend in birth rates observed
in 1967-73 was in fact the start of a long-term trend (even if the rate of
fall was exaggerated by mobilization). A net reproduction rate equal to one
would be attained by about the year 2005. The projected decline in the birth
rate is not likely to be achieved without: (a) a substantial modernization of
Egyptian society, bringing with it more basic education for females and more
modern sector jobs for women; and (b) a great increase in the effectiveness of
the family planning program.

II. POPULATION POLICY AND ORGANIZATION
A. Historical Review and the Role of the Ministry of Health (MOH)
2.01      Although both official and private agencies had been making efforts
to encourage family planning in Egypt since the early 1950s, a national
population program was not established until 1965, when a Presidential decree
made the provision of family planning services the official responsibility
of the Government and established a Supreme Council for Family Planning--
subsequently renamed the Supreme Council for Population and Family Planning.
The voluntary family planning associations which had been operating in the
various Governorates for the previous ten years were officially recognized,
and the Egyptian Family Planning Association (EFPA) was established to co-
ordinate their efforts. At the same time, all service units of the Ministry
of Health (MOH) were instructed to provide family planning services as part
of their regular functions. In the same year, an Executive Board for Family
Planning, now known as the Population and Family Planning Board (PFPB), was
set up to carry out the decisions of the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council
is presided over by the Prime Minister and includes representatives from the
ministries of Social Affairs, Agriculture, Religious Affairs, Education,
Manpower, Local Government and Information and Culture and from the Central
Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics.
2.02      Official thinking on population matters has gone through four phases
since the start of the program. In the first phase, from 1965 to 1973,
attention was concentrated on the provision of family planning services.  It



- 5 -
was during this phase (in 1969) that the Government first adopted the quanti-
tative target of a reduction of one point per thousand per year in the CBR.
In the second phase, from 1973 to 1975, population policy was dominated by
the consideration that as long as it remained economically advantageous, as
well as socially acceptable, for the poor to have large numbers of children,
family planning programs would be unlikely to have much appeal. Thus the
improvement of family planning services per se would not greatly reduce
fertility unless it was accompanied by progress towards such socio-economic
goals as a higher standard of living, better education and wider economic
opportunities for women. In the third phase, starting in 1975, population
policy turned from concentration on fertility reduction to a broader concern
with "population problems," which were regarded as including, in addition to
the rate of growth and size of the population, its geographical distribution,
age structure, and such features as the level of education, occupational
structure, migration and the status of women. In the fourth phase, dating
from early 1977, much more emphasis is being placed on family planning than
in recent years.
2.03      Although MOH service units have provided the main channel for the
provision of family planning services since the official program began in
1965, it was not until June 1973 that the MOH established a Department of
Family Planning. Before 1973, the program was administered by the PFPB, with
consequent confusion between the MOH and PFPB about lines of authority and
responsibility. Furthermore, because payments (incentives) for family plan-
ning services were made through the PFPB, there was (and still is) a tendency
for MOH field staff to regard the delivery of family planning services as
separate from the rest of their duties. To make matters worse, the only
direct link between the MOH and PFPB was the Supreme Council, which rarely
met. The result was that, before 1973, the MOH was not effectively committed
to the promotion of family planning.
2.04      During this period, the MOR left the monitoring and evaluation of
its family planning activities to the PFPB, which compiled monthly statistical
reports from reports submitted by the clinics. The MOH also left the informa-
tion, education and communication (IEC) side of family planning to the PFPB.
A similar situation prevailed as regards maternal and child health/family
planning (MCH/FP) training, although the MOH was more active in this field
than in the others. In-service MCH/FP training was directed primarily to
doctors, and limited to clinical aspects--e.g., intra-uterine device (IUD)
insertion. Little attention was paid to management or community outreach.
Even this limited in-service training has now been discontinued. Out of a
six-week general pre-service training program offered by the MOH for doctors,
one week is devoted to MCH, and only one day to family planning. The MCH/FP
component of this pre-service training program is now being strengthened with
the help of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
The basic MCH/FP training for both doctors and nurses does not include spe-
cific instruction in either contraceptive technology or the management of
primary health care.   -



- 6 -
2.05      Directional changes in the official approach to population problems
(para. 2.02) were accompanied by a reorganization in 1973, whereby the PFPB
was restricted to a policy-making and coordinating role and responsibility for
implementation was assigned to the ministries concerned. Considerable confu-
sion persisted, however, as to each institution's role. Although the MOH,
which was assigned the main responsibility for the implementation of the
family planning program, established a Department of Family Planning in 1973
(para. 2.03), lack of adequate staffing, direction and support prevented it
from having significant impact on the family planning program.
2.06      This situation persisted until early 1977 when, following a reaffirm-
ation by the Minister of Health of his Ministry's commitment to a substantial
reduction of fertility, the administration of the family planning program
within the MOH was reorganized. A new post of Director-General for Family
Planning was established, reporting directly to the First Undersecretary of
the MOH. The Director-General was authorized to plan, develop and implement
an intensified family planning program. The Minister of Health also estab-
lished the High Committee for Family Planning, representing interested minis-
tries, to guide and support the family planning program, and a Technical
Advisory Board composed of experts in relevant disciplines to advise him on
the technical aspects of the program. The High Committee for Family Planning
met for the first time in late 1977. A Senior Adviser for Family Health,
with supporting technical staff, serves as a link between the Director-General
for Family Planning and the High Committee. The technical staff is responsible
for the preliminary review of all projects to be funded by donor agencies--
both national and foreign--before they are submitted to the High Committee and
the Minister. The Department of Family Planning has at present five units,
dealing respectively with: (a) program and training, (b) field supervision,
(c) social services and mass communication, (d) administration, and (e)
architectural matters. In addition, it is proposed that a small group of
staff, now compiling statistics for the Director-General, should form the
nucleus of a sixth unit (statistics). The formation of a research unit is
also planned.
2.07      Along with the renewed interest in family planning in the MOH has
come a recognition that, in Egypt, where family planning has to overcome
social and cultural obstacles, MCH/FP services should be closely integrated on
both the supply and demand sides. As the mothers come to trust the workers
who provide them and their children with health care, they will be more
receptive to the advice these workers offer them on the advantages of family
planning.
2.08      Integration has been facilitated at the governorate level by assign-
ing the supervision of the MCH/FP activities of MOH service units to a single
unit under the Director-General of Health Services. This unit is in most
cases headed by a Director, with a staff of two or three professionals. At
the district level, the supervision of MCH/FP activities of health units is
the responsibility of the Director of Health Services, who is assisted in this
task by a chief nurse.



- 7 -
2.09      The project would enable the MOH to provide integrated MCH/FP
services on a much more intensive scale than hitherto in an area containing
about 26% of the country's population. The project would provide the staff
of the Department of Family Planning with experience which could be used in
a later phase to extend the intensified program to the rest of the country.
B. The Roles of Other Ministries and Agencies
Population and Family Planning Board (PFPB)
2.10      In 1976 the PFPB established a mechanism for coordinating population
activities at the national level whereby each of the ministries concerned
designates a Senior Undersecretary to be responsible for coordination and to
meet periodically with the PFPB.  A similar mechanism has been set up in each
Governorate, but not at lower levels, at which the PFPB is not represented.
There is a plan, however, to extend the coordinating mechanism to the village
level. The Board has some activities in the fields of population education
and communications--in collaboration with the ministries of Education and
Information and Culture, respectively. The Board is also responsible for
tabulation and publication of family planning service statistics and for
evaluation of population activities. Moreover, it conducts population
research, including action research projects.
Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA)/Egyptian Family Planning Association (EFPA)
2.11      The family planning service delivery network of the MOH is comple-
mented by that of the EFPA, a federation of 22 semi-private governorate-level
associations with a total of 451 family planning centers. These centers,
which are found mainly in urban areas where MOH family planning services are
insufficient to meet demand, are provided with accommodations by private reli-
gious and social organizations or by MOSA Social Units. They are normally
open three evenings a week, and use the part-time services of government
medical personnel. The EFPA receives an annual subvention from the Inter-
national Planned Parenthood Federation, which amounted to US$99,000 in 1977,
but has been increased to US$250,000 in 1978 to enable the EFPA to upgrade
some 100 centers annually and to introduce a community-based contraceptive
distribution program. It is understood that funding on this level, together
with an annual subvention of US$115,000 equivalent from the MOSA, will con-
tinue. The MOSA supervises the work of the EFPA, and the Minister of Social
Affairs is the Chairman of its Board of Directors. In addition to the family
planning activities it conducts in conjunction with the EFPA, the MOSA has
introduced population and family planning courses into the pre-service and in-
service training of its staff. Almost one third of the university graduates
who serve their period of obligatory public service with the MOSA spend one
year in family planning work.



-8-
Ministry of Education (MOE)
2.12      The MOE is still in the early stages of developing a population
education program. Population concepts were introduced into intermediate and
secondary school textbooks in 1974. The MOE has recently established a unit
for population education, with two full-time staff members under the direction
of an Undersecretary. It is beginning to produce teaching materials and to
introduce population into teacher training. The proposed Second IDA Education
Project, appraised in April 1978, includes support for the MOE's population
education program.
Ministry of Information and Culture (MOIC)
2.13      The Egyptian Television Corporation (which is part of the MOIC) has
a Health and Family Planning Unit. There is a weekly radio program devoted to
family planning; and family planning ideas are introduced into radio programs
for youth, farmers, women and workers. The MOIC also promotes family planning
through articles and advertisements in newspapers and magazines.
C. Performance and Constraints of the Family Planning and MCH Programs
Family Planning Program
2.14      Primary health care in rural Egypt is provided through rural health
units (RHUs) and rural health centers (RHCs), which numbered 1,661 and 614,
respectively, by the end of 1977, giving a ratio of one health facility per
about 9,200 population. Each RHU is normally staffed by a physician, two
assistant nurses or assistant midwives, a laboratory assistant, an assistant
sanitarian, a part-time dentist and general service staff. Each RHC is
normally staffed by two physicians, six assistant nurses or assistant midwives,
a chief nurse, a laboratory assistant, a Public Health Inspector, two drivers,
and general service staff. In urban areas, primary health care is provided
through 220 MCH centers and 25 general health centers (GHCs). Each MCH center
is designed to serve a population of 50,000 to 100,000. It is typically
staffed by four doctors, a chief nurse, eight assistant midwives or midwives
(plus one more assistant midwife or midwife for each 10,000 additional popula-
tion), one or two social workers, one or two dentists, one or two pharmacists,
a laboratory technician, a health visitor, a health educator, a sanitarian, a
driver and 10-15 general service staff. All primary health facilities provide
family planning services, but it appears that there are large differences
among their levels of activity in this respect. Family planning services are
also offered through 297 health bureaus (in urban areas), 267 hospitals,
451 EFPA clinics, and 188 private clinics serving special groups (for example,
the families of the workers of a given factory). All family planning clinics
provide contraceptive pills (the main contraceptive used in Egypt) and condoms.
Only about one fourth of the clinics provide IUDs. Pills and condoms are also
distributed through street vendors and other commercial outlets. Other con-
traceptive methods such as foams, creams and diaphragms are provided by family



- 9 -
family planning clinics and pharmacies, but in negligible quantities. Male
and female sterilizations are provided by some university and MOH hospitals
on request, but are not officially promoted. Abortion is illegal except in
medical emergencies.
2.15      Table 3 below presents rough estimates of the number of users of
the three main contraceptive methods in mid-1977, by source of supply. These
estimates are based for the most part on PFPB service statistics, but a number
of assumptions (e.g., regarding continuation rates for IUDs) had to be made
to fill information gaps. However, the figure of 18% for the total number of
users of program methods as a proportion of married women of reproductive age
does not seem inconsistent with the 1976 estimate of 36 per 1,000 for the CBR,
in light of the experience of other countries. Out of the total estimated
number of users of the three methods, approximately 58% were pill users, 22%
were condom users, and 20% were IUD users. The figures in Table 3 refer to
the country as a whole and mask large regional differences in contraceptive
use. Thus, for example, in October 1977 the number of pill cycles distributed
in rural areas amounted to only 19% of the total for the country, although
rural areas contain about 58% of married women aged 15-45.

2.16      Expansion of the family planning program has been constrained by a
number of factors. The lack of commitment on the part of the MOH until very
recently is mentioned in para 2.03. The program has also suffered from a
failure to use outreach approaches.
2.17      In comparison with other developing countries with similar per
capita incomes, Egypt is well endowed with health facilities, and the expan-
sion of MCH/FP services in most parts of the country is not impeded by a
shortage of clinics or clinic staff. Some rural areas, however, still lack
easy access to any health facility. Likewise, in some urban areas, the
network of primary-level health facilities is still inadequate. Many clinics,
urban and rural, are short of equipment and transport.
2.18      The inadequate supply of contraceptives has been a problem in the
past, but the situation has been improving recently as a result of efforts by
the MOH and PFPB to maintain stocks of contraceptive supplies equivalent to
three months' needs at the health unit level and to six months' needs at the
Governorate level. Service statistics on family planning activities of MOH
and EFPA clinics have been collected and published by the PFPB since 1966, but
they are limited to quantities of contraceptive devices distributed and are
affected by serious reporting deficiencies. No information is collected on
the number and characteristics of new family planning acceptors or dropouts.
2.19      Two other critical constraints have been the inadequate training
and supervision of health personnel. The training of health personnel (both
medical and paramedical) is clearly inadequate, not only in the MCH/FP field,
but also in community medicine in general (para. 2.04). There is no adequate
review or supervision of the work of MOH staff, especially in community
outreach, because the supervisory staff are poorly trained and satisfactory
transport does not exist. Improved supervision is of particular importance
for the success of the family planning program in view of the weak commitment
of health service personnel to family planning.
2.20      These weaknesses are reflected in the community in the form of in-
adequate knowledge of family planning facts and inadequate information about
the availability of family planning services. There are also social and
cultural barriers to family planning in Egypt. For example, many married
couples wrongly believe that family planning is not permitted by the Moslem
religion.  Government officials believe that this particular barrier could
be overcome by an adequate informational and educational campaign. In its
publicity in favor of family planning, the Government has been emphasizing
the health benefits resulting from fewer and adequately spaced births, in the
belief that this approach will help to overcome the traditional preference for
large families.
Maternal and Child Health Program
2.21      On the primary level, the MCH program offers services through 220
MCH centers and 25 GHCs in urban areas and 2,275 RHCs and RHUs in rural areas.
Each MCH center is designed to serve a population of 50,000 to 100,000, while



- 11 -
the rural facilities on the average serve a population of about 9,200 (para.
2.14). Secondary-level MCH services are offered through a network of 172
general and specialized hospitals in district and governorate capital cities.
In addition, 297 urban health bureaus provide immunization for mothers and
children and record births and deaths. At a still higher level, specialized
MCH services (including family planning) are provided by national medical
centers and university hospitals.
2.22      In many instances, the quantity and quality of maternal and child
health services provided in both urban and rural areas, are inadequate.  On
the average there is less than one prenatal visit per mother in urban areas and
1.7 such visits in rural areas, compared with a minimum of six recommended by
the MOH. Nearly 80% of all deliveries in rural areas occur at home without
trained assistance. Most of them are attended by traditional birth attendants
(dayas). There are on the average about 1.9 postnatal visits per mother in
urban areas and 5.3 in rural areas, compared with the seven prescribed by the
MOH.
2.23      The expansion of maternal and child health services, like that of
family planning services, is restricted by such factors as poor training
and supervision of health personnel, failure to utilize outreach approaches,
and lack of knowledge on the part of the general public of MCH facts and
of services available, as well as by gaps in the network of primary health
facilities and shortages of equipment and transport (para. 2.17).
D. First Population Project
2.24      On October 23, 1973, the Executive Directors approved a credit of
US$5.0 million to help finance a project, estimated to cost US$10.5 million
equivalent, to strengthen the family planning component of Egypt's new inte-
grated health system. The project consisted of the construction and equipping
of 22 GHCs, 12 polyclinics and six training centers; the purchase of 150 multi-
purpose vehicles; an experimental home visiting program; a study of family
planning acceptance; a study of the maintenance of health facilities and
equipment; and the production of family planning education material. Subse-
quently, on January 19, 1977, the credit agreement was amended by approval of
the Executive Directors (IDA/R77-1), to reduce the number of health facilities
(to nine GHCs, four polyclinics and one training center) in view of substan-
tial cost overruns and of a revision in the Government's overall program for
construction of health facilities. Eight of the GHCs financed under the first
project are completed, staffed and in use. The polyclinics, the training
center at Assiut and the remaining GHC are expected to open in late 1978.
2.25      The home visiting program is nearing completion, though its scope
has been reduced to about 5,000 families instead of the original 50,000.
This reduction was due to the Project Executive Director-General's belief
that the smaller sample of families would be more manageable and large enough
for the purposes of the experiment. The lessons learned from this program
have been incorporated in the expanded home visiting program in the proposed



- 12 -
second project (Chapter III.C). The maintenance study has now been completed,
and the MOH will be using it as the basis for the improvement of maintenance
for its facilities and equipment. The collection of data for the study on
family planning acceptance has been completed, although the geographical scope
of the study was reduced, due to insufficient local funds at the time the
study was launched. The data are now being analyzed. The proposed production
of family planning education materials was abandoned because the MOH decided
to procure the materials from commercial sources instead.
2.26      The preparation and implementation of the first project did not
proceed smoothly. Undue delay (more than one year) in the start of implemen-
tation, budgetary problems which resulted in a shortage of funds, difficulties
in complying with IDA's guidelines for procurement and a general lack of
commitment on the part of those responsible for leadership in the Government
caused extraordinary delays and difficulties in the implementation of the
project. To these were added the substantial increase in building costs in
Egypt (about 300% between 1973-76) and general inflation which led the Gov-
ernment to reduce the scope of the project. However, since late 1976, the
implementation of the project, though on a reduced scale, has considerably
improved and, at the end of July 1978, 84% of the credit had been disbursed.
2.27      A major benefit of the first project was the establishment of a
meaningful dialogue between the Bank and the policy-makers in the health and
population fields in Egypt. This dialogue led to the development of the
proposed second project, which addresses more directly and on a significantly
larger scale the problems of implementing an effective family planning program.
E. External Assistance to Family Planning/Population
Program Activities in Egypt
2.28      A number of bilateral and multilateral agencies have provided sup-
port for population and family planning activities in Egypt since the mid-
1960s. Prominent among these have been the USAID, Cooperative for American
Relief Everywhere, and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities. A
summary of donor activities is included below.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Concept
3.01      The project marks the renewed determination of the Government of
Egypt to take action to reduce population growth. It addresses, more directly
and on a significantly larger scale than any previous program in the country,
the problems which have hindered the adoption of family planning practices.
It will be carried out mainly through the Ministry of Health. While some
project activities will be implemented at a national level (IEC; research and
evaluation; and activities conducted through EFPA), most will be limited to
seven of Egypt's 25 Governorates. These Governorates (the Project Governo-
rates) are: Giza, Qalubia, Qena, Minya, El-Wadi El Gedid, Kafr-El-Sheik,
and Cairo. Project activities in Cairo Governorate will be limited to two
districts: El-Sharrabia and El-Zawia El-Hamra. The total population in
this area amounts to about 10 million, or 26% of the population of Egypt.
It is contemplated that, at a later stage, a similar program would be under-
taken in other areas of the country, in light of the experience gained from
the project and from other related projects now being carried out (e.g., the
USAID-financed project in Menoufia Governorate, which combines a community-
based system of distribution of contraceptives with motivational activities
and the provision of other social services).
3.02      The project is designed to contribute in the project governorates
(and, to some extent, in other areas as well) to a reduction in: (a) fer-
tility; (b) infant mortality and morbidity; and (c) maternal mortality and
morbidity. These three objectives are interdependent. Lower fertility,
through the better spacing of births, improves maternal health and infant
nutrition and, by reducing the incidence of pregnancy in high-risk groups of
women, reduces maternal mortality. Reduced infant mortality leads to lower
fertility, as fewer births are needed to attain a given desired family size.
3.03      In order to reduce fertility, the number of users of contraceptive
methods, both within and outside the official family planning program, must
be increased. With this in view, the project would aim at increasing the
demand for family planning as well as improving the supply of family planning
services. The demand for family planning services would be stimulated direct-
ly through client motivation activities and indirectly through the reduction
of infant mortality. A reduction in infant mortality is thus both an ultimate
objective of the project and a means of reducing fertility. Client motivation
activities would take two main forms:  (a) an IEC program; and (b) a program
of home visits by a new category of part-time home visiting workers.
3.04      The increased use of MCH services would lead to a reduction in
maternal mortality (the third goal of the project), as well as infant mortality.
As in the case of family planning services, the project will seek to encourage
a greater use of MCH services by stimulating demand and improving supply. On
both supply and demand sides the promotion of MCH will be closely linked with
that of family planning; both types of services will be provided by the same
workers in the same clinics, and ,the same IEC campaigns and home visitors will
serve both.

3.05      The project is designed to ease the constraints on the MCH/FP pro-
grams (Chapter II.C). About one third of the cost of the project will be in
respect of IEC and home visiting activities to increase the demand for MCR/FP
services. These two types of activities will interact: the IEC program will
provide materials to be used by the home visitors, who in turn will gather
information on people's attitudes towards MCH/FP which will guide the produc-
tion of IEC materials. This part of the project will address two major con-
straints to the expansion of MCH/FP programs, namely, the failure to utilize
outreach approaches and the insufficient levels of community awareness and
knowledge of MCH/FP facts and services available.
3.06      Twenty-one percent of the cost of the project will be allocated for
a MCH/FP training program designed to improve the quality of MCH/FP service
delivery in three ways: (a) by training MOH field workers in the requisite
skills; (b) by training MOH supervisory staff at all levels (medical officers,
supervisory nurses, directors of health services at the district level,
Directors-General and assistant directors-general at the governorate level,
etc.) in management techniques; and (c) by practical in-service training of
existing technical staff on basic maintenance of buildings, equipment and
vehicles.
3.07      A further one third of the cost of the project will be earmarked for
improvements in the supply of health services in the project area through
the provision of additional clinics, equipment and vehicles. The vehicles
will include transport for supervisors at the district and governorate levels,
in addition to pick-up/ambulances.
3.08      The balance of the cost of the project is accounted for by:  (a) re-
search and evaluation (5.2%), including a new Statistical Unit in the Depart-
ment of Family Planning of the MOH, a new Research and Development Unit in the
same Department, and an external research program; (b) support to EFPA (1.9%);
(c) support to project management (1.3%); and (d) innovative activities to be
identified during project implementation (4.5%).
3.09      The project governorates have been chosen to be broadly representa-
tive of the various regions of the country. A brief description of the project
Governorates follows:
(a) Kafr el-Sheik: from Lower Egypt, large Governorate
(3,492 sq km) at base of the Egyptian Delta and bordering
the Mediterranean; highly rural and agricultural. Per-
centage rural: 79%. Population in November 1976:
1,403,468.
(b)  Qalubia:  from Lower Egypt, but representing an extension
of Cairo (immediately north of Cairo) and, hence, more
centrally located, small Governorate (944 sq km). This
Governorate was included as part of the First Population
Project. Percentage rural: 59%. Population in
November 1976:  1,674,006.



- 16 -
(c)  Giza:  designated as an Upper Egyptian Governorate but,
as was the case with Qalubia, is actually an extension of
Cairo. Also, like Qalubia, a relatively small Governorate
(1,078 sq km) but more urban in composition. Percentage
rural: 43%. Population in November 1976: 2,419,247.
(d)  Minya:  fairly large Upper Egyptian Governorate (2,274 sq km),
located approximately one third of the way between Cairo and
Aswan; predominantly rural area. This Governorate was also
included in the First Population Project. Percentage rural:
79%. Population in November 1976: 2,055,739.
(e)  Qena:  rural medium-sized Governorate (1,811 sq km) located
in the heart of Upper Egypt and the last Governorate before
Aswan. In addition to strongly entrenched, traditional beliefs
and practices, the area is noted for tribal factionalism,
its extremely high male-status orientation (many women still
live in strict seclusion, inaccessible even to the village
doctor in times of emergency), and extreme cultural diversity
(due to the existence of different ethnic groups within the
same area). This Governorate represents a special challenge
to any program attempting to bring about major changes in
reproductive values and norms. Percentage rural: 77%.
Population in November 1976: 1,705,-594.
(f) El-Wadi El-Gedid: small (in population size), frontier
Governorate located in desert region west of Sohag and Qena
Governorates; large rural component but many new settlements
based on urban model; population widely dispersed. This
Governorate presents a special challenge in terms of providing
adequate coverage for its scattered population. Percentage
rural: 77%. Population in November 1976: 56,691.
(g) In addition to the above, two districts from Cairo, El-
Sharrabia and El-Zawia El-Hamra, will be included in the
project's coverage. These two districts represent two
of the worst slum areas in Cairo and, although they are
industrial suburbs of Cairo, are isolated from surrounding
urban areas. These communities are marked by a shortage of
community centers and related activities and a high incidence
of accidents, crimes, disputes and other social problems.
In addition, many homes are without public utilities, and
sanitation and pollution problems are everywhere in evidence.
Population in November 1976:  414,270.

B. Project Objectives
Family Planning Targets
3.10      In 1973, the Supreme Council for Population and Family Planning
reaffirmed the aim--first stated in 1969--of a reduction in the CBR of one
point per thousand per year over the next ten years, i.e., from an estimated
34 per thousand in 1972 to 24 per thousand in 1982. Since the CBR is esti-
mated to have been about 36 per thousand in 1975-76, it appears that the
planned rate of reduction is not being achieved. The question which then
arises is: What increase of effort in the family planning field would be
*         necessary to achieve a reduction in the CBR of one point per thousand per
year in the CBR up to 1982?
3.11      Estimates of the number of continuing users of pills, IUDs and con-
doms consistent with a reduction in the CBR from an assumed 36 per thousand
in 1977 to 31 per thousand in 1982 are presented in Table 4 below. These
estimates are for the nation as a whole. The incidence of abortion and of
other contraceptive methods, such as withdrawal and sterilization, is assumed
to remain unchanged. In order to reach the targets of Table 4, the proportion
of married women of reproductive age (15-45) who are continuing users of
one of the three program contraceptive methods would need to be increased from
18.2% in 1977 to 30.5% in 1982, and a total of about 3.5 million new acceptors
would need to be recruited over the period 1978-82.

/1  In computing Table 4, it was assumed that the breakdown of users of all
three methods between family planning centers and the "private sector"
will remain unchanged over the period 1977-82 at 1977 levels. Moreover,
it was assumed that the proportion of IUD users among all users of the
three chief program methods (pills, IUDs and condoms) will increase
from 20.3% in 1977 to 30% in 1982, while the proportion of pill users
will decrease from 58.1% in 1977 to 50% in 1982. A slight decrease in
the proportion of condom users was also assumed. The importance of an
increase in the proportion of IUD users is that IUD users tend to have
much higher continuation rates than pill users. The estimates are
based mainly on PFPB service statistics.
/2  Includes MOH clinics, EFPA clinics, and other FP centers in factories,
military installations, etc.
/3  Includes pharmacies and other commercial outlets (the latter, for
condoms only).
3.12     Targets in terms of users of program methods in the project Governo-
rates are shown in Table 5 below. For this area, it is estimated that the
proportion of married women of reproductive age who were continuing users of
one of the three program methods in mid-1977 was about 17%, slightly below
the national average. Attainment of the targets in Table 5 would raise this
figure to about 30.5% in 1982, the same as the target for the nation as a
whole (para. 3.11). It is assumed that the percentage of pill users among all
users of the three program methods in the project Governorates will decline
from an estimated 54% in 1977 to 50% in 1982; the percentage of condom users
will decline from an estimated 29% in 1977 to 25% in 1982; and the percentage
of IUD users will increase from an estimated 16% in 1977 to 25% in 1982. The
number of new acceptors of pills, IUDs and condoms required in the project
Governorates over the period 1978-82 would be about 850,000.

A   Includes MOH clinics, EFPA clinics, and other FP centers in factories,
military installations, etc.
/2  Includes pharmacies and other commercial outlets (the latter, for
condoms only).
3.13     The above targets are ambitious.  Given the record of the Egyptian
family planning program, it is doubtful whether they can be attained, especially
for the nation as a whole. For the project Governorates, a doubling of the
number of continuing users over 1977 levels could perhaps be realistically
expected by mid-1984. Even this somewhat more modest target would entail a
considerable effort. However, the combination of the project inputs, the
improvements in the organization and administration of the MOH family planning
program since mid-1977, and the enlistment of the support of the local authori-
ties would provide a powerful impetus to family planning activities in the
project Governorates.
3.14      The family planning targets in the project Governorates will be
broken down by Governorates and districts (para. 3.64). In doing this,
differences in contraceptive use among Governorates would need to be consid-
ered. Contraceptive use by married women of reproductive age (for the three
major program methods) varies widely among the project Governorates, ranging
from a low of about 5% for Minya and Qena to about 40% for Cairo and Qalubia.
In the remainder the proportion is between 15 and 20%. Thus, in setting
family planning targets for individual project Governorates, different
rates of growth in the number of users would have to be assumed.
Maternal and Child Health Targets
3.15      The project aims to improve the health of mothers and children by:



- 20 -
(a) raising the average age of the mother before the birth
of the first child;
(b) increasing the interval between births;
(c) reducing the incidence of births over the age
of 35; and
(d) reducing the frequency of families of more than four, and
especially of more than six children.
Such changes in fertility patterns would, by their influence on maternal
and child health, encourage still lower fertility.
3.16      The following specific MCH targets will be set for the project
Governorates (to be achieved by the end of 1984):
(a) increase in deliveries supervised by trained persons to
over 80%;
(b) increase in prenatal care (six visits per mother) to 75%,
and postpartum care (seven visits per mother) to 100%;
(c) reduction of nutritional anemia among pregnant and lactating
women by half;
(d) elevation of the first-year immunization rate for children
to 90%;
(e) elimination of tetanus neonatorum entirely and reducing
deaths from gastroenteritis by half; and
(f) reduction of nutritional anemia in children aged 0-6 by half.
3.17      Through the achievement of these targets, it is expected that
maternal and infant mortality rates in the project Governorates would be
reduced by one half. The project would also provide for better monitoring
of changes in the above indicators.
C. Project Description
Information, Education and Communication (IEC)
3.18      Background.  In Egypt, the EFPA and PFPB have been mainly respon-
sible for IEC activities in support of the national family planning program.
The MOB has undertaken very little IEC work. The First IDA Population Project
provided a small allocation for the production of family planning education
materials which was not used (para. 2.25). The MOH's health education
program has paid little attention to family planning materials. The EFPA's



- 21 -
IEC work has been confined to its own family planning clinics, which are
mainly in urban areas. The PFPB has used mass media, chiefly the press, in
collaboration with the MOIC. Population education is the responsibility of
the MOE, with support from the PFPB. The introduction of population education
into formal schools is, however, recent.
3.19      Needs.  The low rates of contraceptive use and the high dropout
rates of family planning programs in Egypt, especially in rural areas, in-
dicate that too little effort has been made to recruit new acceptors and to
persuade acceptors to continue contraceptive use.  Married couples are not
encouraged to space their children. Most married Egyptian women do not begin
to practice family planning until they have had their third child, in part
because the benefits of better spacing have not been adequately brought to
their attention. A survey suggests that the high dropout rates of pill users
in Egypt are partially attributable to anxiety due to lack of accurate in-
formation. IEC activities have been hindered by public apathy, lack of
community participation, and cultural prejudices.
3.20      Limitations of IEC programs.  The chief limitations of the present
IEC programs are:
(a) the absence of a comprehensive plan of action;
(b) the inadequate use of mass media, especially
television, radio and newspapers;
(c) an acute shortage of materials, e.g., films,
slides, leaflets and posters;
(d) a dearth of audiovisual equipment, audiovisual
materials production equipment and audiovisual
technicians;
(e) failure to use outreach methods of approach in rural
communities; and
(f)  the lack of leadership, coordination and monitoring.
3.21      Objectives.  The purpose of the proposed IEC program is to support
the Egyptian Government's efforts towards fertility reduction and improve-
ment of maternal and child health.
3.22      In support of this objective, the IEC program would aim at:
(a) increasing understanding of the population problem among
the nation's leaders;
(b) advocating smaller families as a means to better maternal
and child health and greater family well being;



- 22 -
(c) persuading married couples to accept family planning
as a means of achieving not only smaller families,
but also the better spacing of births;
(d) training young people in responsible parenthood;
(e) allaying fears and counteracting false rumors by
providing accurate information about contraceptives;
and
(f) helping families to recognize the benefits to be derived
from increased use of the available maternal and child
health services.
3.23      Proposed strategies for strengthening the IEC program.  The IEC
program will primarily be addressed to the highly fertile, married women
(especially poor and illiterate women in rural areas) who already have two or
more children. This group will be reached through home visits, mobile health
education and information units, radio programs, printed materials and audio-
visual aids. The IEC program will also be concerned with improving the know-
ledge of family planning among social and political leaders through mass
media programs, meetings and seminars. Young Egyptians and their elders would
become aware of the population problem and the desirability of small families
through population education in schools and community health education
campaigns.
3.24      Special emphasis will be placed on improving continuation rates,
increasing the proportion of IUD users, and expanding further into rural areas
and the urban poor previously not reached by the MCH/FP program.
3.25      Proposed IEC input and justification.  The project will provide 14
vehicles fully equipped with audiovisual equipment to promote the MCH/FP pro-
gram in the project Governorates. The project will also provide audiovisual
equipment for the Health Education Division in the project Governorates, and
for 59 MCH centers, 179 RHCs, 560 RHUs, and 6 training centers (all of them in
the project Governorates).
3.26      The family planning program in Egypt has suffered from severe short-
ages of educational and motivational materials for use in the field. The
project, therefore, will provide for the production of the following materials
by the Center for Educational Technology of the MOH:
(a) 16 feature films (30 minutes) and 40 short films (two
minutes) on MCH/FP topics;
(b) 24 programs of slides, 20 programs of filmstrips,
40 programs of transparencies, and 24 programs of
cassette tapes;



- 23 -
(c) 16 kinds of posters, 16 kinds of booklets, 20 kinds of
leaflets and 8 kinds of stickers; and
(d) 2 types of flipcharts.
Films and other audiovisual materials will be used by the mobile units,
theaters, health facilities and public halls. Flipcharts will be used by
the home visitors and in the clinics.
3.27      To enable the Center for Educational Technology to expand its capac-
ity to produce training and educational materials of the appropriate types,
the project will provide printing and duplicating machinery; processing and
finishing equipment; complete equipment for two recording, copying and editing
studies; and related hardware. This new equipment will be installed in a new
extension already under construction which is expected to be completed by the
end of 1978.
3.28      The project will strengthen MOIC's IEC activities by providing
a "Theater Caravan" and establishing 41 Radio and Television Viewers' and
Listeners' (RTVL) clubs in the project Governorates. The "Theater Caravan"
will use folk media, such as puppet shows, folk dancing, singing and story-
telling, to promote MCH/FP activities. Each RTVL club will have 20 to 30
members, mostly in the reproductive age group. The project will provide each
club with furniture and funds to cover operating costs, as well as one tele-
vision set and one radio set. Each club will hold regular meetings at which
MCH/FP educational TV or radio programs will be followed by discussion. The
RTVL clubs and the "Theater Caravan" will be jointly organized by the Radio
and Television Units of the MOIC and the Department of Family Planning of the
MOH.
3.29      The project will provide for communication research and evaluation,
including a baseline survey, two media habit and audience studies, message
contents analyses, RTVL club studies, and the pre- and post-testing of IEC
materials and meetings. Except for the last item, these studies will be
contracted out.
3.30      The project will also provide for 30 man-months of fellowships
for MOH staff and 76 man-months of advisory services. The fellowships will
include two master's degree programs in health education and communication.
Advisory services (by local consultants) will include: (a) a senior IEC
consultant for planning, supervision and monitoring (48 man-months); (b) an
IEC material development specialist (12 man-months); (c) an audiovisual equip-
ment specialist (three man-months); (d) a communication training specialist
(four man-months); (e) a communication research and evaluation specialist
(three man-months); and (f) a health education specialist (six man-months).
3.31      The project will also provide for the additional staff needed by
the mobile health education and information units (para. 3.25) and by the
Center for Educational-Technology and MOIC to carry out the activities
described above.



- 24 -
3.32      The MOH established a task force with representatives from the MOH
and MOIC to prepare an IEC strategy and four-year IEC plan for the integrated
MCH/FP program, which was the basis for the preparation of the IEC component
in this project. There is still need, however, for a detailed IEC plan of
action indicating the time phasing and other implementation details of the
activities in the plan. For the purpose of coordinating IEC activities, a
Communications Action Coordinating Commitee, with representatives from the
MOH and MOIC, will be established within the MOH. This Committee will be
responsible for the preparation of the above-mentioned, detailed IEC plan of
action and for monitoring and evaluation. This committee will be established
and in operation not later than May 1, 1979 (para. 7.01(h). Within the MOH,
the Social Services and Mass Communications Unit in the Department of Family
Planning will act as a Secretariat to the Communication Action Coordinating
Committee and will coordinate the work of the departments concerned with IEC.
A consultant has been appointed to advise the Social Services and Mass Com-
munications Unit on MCH/FP IEC activities for the whole project implementation
period. The salary of this consultant is being paid from an advance under the
Project Preparation Facility, which also provides funds for the initial design
and production of IEC materials (paras. 4.09-4.10). Implementation of clinic-
based IEC activities in the project Governorates, which will be strengthened
by the provision of equipment under the project (para. 3.25), is the responsi-
bility of the Health Education Division of the Office of the Director-General
of Health Services in each Governorate. The same will be true of the IEC
activities of mobile units to be provided under the project (para. 3.25).
3.33      The Government has undertaken that the detailed IEC plan of action
(para. 3.32) will be prepared by the MOH in consultation with other ministries
not later than May 1, 1979 (para. 7.01(f)).
Home Visiting Program
3.34      The first IDA population project included an experimental home
visiting program for about 5,000 families in the Bahteem area of Qalubia
Governorate. Although the program has not been formally evaluated, and it is
too soon to measure its effects on the acceptance and use of family planning
and health services, it has helped to convince the MOH of the importance of
community outreach activities for the creation of demand for family planning
and health services.
3.35      The results of this experimental home visiting program and of other
similar experiments in Egypt have encouraged the MOH to organize a home visit-
ing program in the project Governorates which will cover a population of about
10 million.
3.36      The object of the home visiting program is to make the community,
and in particular all eligible mothers, aware of the need for better MCH/FP
care and of how this need can be met. The program would encourage mothers to:



- 25 -
(a) make full use of prenatal, delivery and postnatal MCH
services in order to maintain their own health and to
ensure that their children receive immunization,
nutrition and other child health care; and
(b) use family planning services as a means of ensuring
smaller and healthier families.
3.37      Each household will be visited at least once every two months by a
trained home visitor who will advise the family (especially the mother) on
matters related to MCH/FP. Pregnant women will be encouraged to visit the
clinic regularly for prenatal care and to seek proper care at the time of
delivery. Those using contraception will be encouraged to continue, and those
who have discontinued use will be encouraged to resume. This will be done in
collaboration with health unit/center staff.
3.38      Recruitment of the home visitors and their supervisors.  The home
visitors, who will be mostly women, will be selected from community residents
who have had experience in community work and can spare at least three hours
a day for home visiting six days a week. The selection will be made in each
district by a committee consisting of the Director of Health Services, the
chief nurse, and the social worker attached to the Office of the Director of
Health Services. In rural areas, the committee will consult the village
council concerned before appointing a visitor. Each home visitor will cover
a population of about 1,000, or about 200 families. Every seven home visitors
will have a supervisor who will visit each visitor at least once every two
weeks for the first six months and every three weeks afterwards, and check
her work by sample home visits. The Nursing Supervisor in the Office of the
Director-General of Health Services in the Governorate will be responsible for
implementing the home visiting program, with the assistance of the MCH/FP Unit
of that office. At the central MOH level, the Program Adviser (appointed
to work full-time in the software aspects of the project) in the Department
of Family Planning will be responsible for detailed planning, monitoring and
provision of technical guidance for the home visiting program. He will be
assisted in this task by the Field Supervisory Unit in the same Department.
3.39      Each home visitor will receive eight weeks of training at the dis-
trict level. The trainers will include medical officers, nurses, health
educators and social workers. The trainers will be trained by the MOH in
collaboration with the Institute of National Planning and/or the Department
of Social Work in a local university. Periodic two-week refresher courses
for home visitors will be conducted at the multi-purpose training centers to
be established under this project (para. 3.44). Each home visitor will be
provided with a motivational kit containing audiovisual aids and with check
lists for guidance in conducting visits. The supervisors of the home visitors
will be trained for about ten weeks at the governorate level.
3.40      The Government has undertaken that the home visitors will meet the
criteria stated in para. 3.38 above and that a detailed plan for the implemen-
tation, supervision and evaluation of the program will be prepared not later
than May 1, 1979 (para. 7.01(e)).



- 26 -
3.41      Costs.  Incremental recurrent costs for payments to about 10,500
home visitors and 1,545 supervisors for the project period of four years
amount to LE6.2 million (US$8.8 million equivalent). The cost of employing
each home visitor per year comes to about US$172 equivalent (about US$14 per
month). Considering the importance of their work and its timing (often late
in the day when people are at home), this unit cost appears reasonable. The
cost of kits is included under the IEC component and the cost of training
under the training component.
MCH/FP Training
3.42      Training Unit.  A training unit has been recently established in the
Department of Family Planning in the MOH. This unit will be responsible for
assessing the pre- and in-service training needs of the various categories of
MCH/FP staff, preparing the necessary training programs and evaluating their
success. It will be responsible for organizing, not only the training of
field staff, but also orientation seminars and workshops for senior and
middle-level officials. The unit is not yet staffed to carry out the above
responsibilities. The project would therefore provide funds for salaries of
incremental staff (three professionals) and their training abroad (26 man-
months). The project would also include training seminars and workshops.
3.43      About 24 selected staff from the MOH and ten faculty members of
universities are to be given intensive preparation abroad (one month each) to
enable them to lead the training program in the project area. Funds for this
.purpose have been budgeted under an advance from the Project Preparation
Facility (paras. 4.09-4.10), to allow for the prompt implementation of this
activity. Technical assistance under the project also includes two man-years
of foreign advisory services to assist in the development of a training plan,
strategy, methods and curricula.
3.44      Governorate-level training centers.  In six of the seven project
Governorates (excluding El-Wadi El-Gedid Governorate, which will use the
existing multi-purpose training center in Assiut) a multipurpose training
center is to be established with accommodations for about 40 trainees. The
head of each center will be responsible to the Director of Health Services for
the district where the center is located and through him to the Director of
Training in the Office of the Director-General of Health Services at the
governorate level. Each center will have a teaching staff of five, respon-
sible respectively for instruction in MCH/FP, nursing, training, program
management, and the maintenance of vehicles, equipment and health facilities.
3.45      Each center will include living accommodations for staff and stud-
ents, classrooms, an education materials unit, library, demonstration labora-
tory, three demonstration maintenance workshops, and a shelter for its
vehicles, which will consist of one bus (40-passenger capacity), four mini-
buses (ten-passenger capacity) and one station wagon for supervision. The
project, in addition to providing the vehicles, will cover costs of construc-
tion, furnishing, operational expenses including training costs, and technical
assistance.



- 27 -
3.46      The following categories of workers will receive in-service training
in MCH/FP at the centers:
(a)  MOH supervisory personnel; and
(b)  MOH staff of rural and urban service units, including
doctors, nurses, sanitarians, educators and social
workers.
Preference will be given to staff from project Governorates. The centers
will also help to train the supervisors for the home visiting program and to
provide instruction in MCH/FP for staff from departments other than Health in
the project Governorates. The Centers will also impart maintenance training
to staff responsible for using, maintaining and repairing MOH's health and
training facilities, vehicles and equipment, including technical medical
assistants, engineers, mechanics, electricians and plumbers.
3.47      There are presently about 10,000 staff in the field health units
of the project Governorates, all of whom will be covered by the MO0's new
in-service training program in MCH/FP.  Among these staff, nurses and medical
officers will have priority for such training.  The MOH plans to begin train-
ing nurses and medical doctors immediately, using the existing senior medical
and nursing staff at the governorate and central MOH levels as trainers. For
this purpose, existing facilities or rented accommodations will be utilized,
pending the construction, equipment and staffing of the training centers,
which are expected to be completed by the end of 1980. The training centers
will each have a capacity to train about 500 staff per year, assuming that
courses will have an average duration of four weeks. Full utilization of the
training centers will be possible for the second half of the project period
(1981-82), and for many years thereafter, in order to train new health staff
of the project Governorates, and to provide training to the other categories
of staff mentioned in para. 3.46. The Government will furnish to IDA for its
review outline training programs for the training centers not later than May
1, 1977 (para. 7.01g).
3.48      The training of Egyptian medical students in family planning and
primary health care is at present handicapped by a lack of supervised field
experience. To help fill this gap, the project will provide for the con-
struction and furnishing of living quarters for two medical students in 90
RHUs, distributed as follows: 18 in Minya, 12 in El-Wadi El-Gedid, and 15 in
each of the other project Governorates except Cairo. Student housing at the
RHUs would enable up to 2,340 medical students annually to be given four weeks
of field training. This training will be under the control of the correspond-
ing universities and will be imparted by the medical officer in each of the
RHUs to which the student housing will be attached.
3.49      The Program Adviser in the Department of Family Planning of the MOH
will be responsible for detailed planning of the implementation of the train-
ing component. He will be assisted in this task by the Program and Training
Unit of the same Department. This unit will also be responsible for: (a)



- 28 -
training of trainers and senior staff; (b) administration of fellowships; (c)
monitoring the operations of the training centers; and (d) providing technical
guidance to centers' staff. The Director-General of Health Services in each
project Governorate, assisted by his Director of Training, will be responsible
for the establishment of the training centers, but actual construction and
procurement of equipment will be centrally managed by the Administrative Unit
in the Department of Family Planning.
Health Service Delivery Intensification
3.50      Rural health units (RHUs).  Integrated MCH/FP services for Egypt's
21 million rural population are provided through 614 RHCs/Combined Rural
Hospitals, each serving an average of about 15,000 people, and 1,661 RHUs, the
smallest units in the health delivery network, each planned to serve a village
of about 5,000 population, though at present the average is about 7,100 per
center. In its 1978-82 Five-Year Plan, the MOH will give priority in the
establishment of RHUs to villages of at least 5,000 people which are three km
or farther from the nearest health facility. The MOH plans to construct 57
additional RHUs between 1978 and 1980 in the rural areas of the project
Governorates, thus reducing the average population per RHU in these areas from
about 10,000 to about 8,000. The project would include the construction and
equipping of 48 of these RHUs.
3.51      Each RHU currently offers the following services:
(a)  registration of births and deaths, vaccination and
immunization;
(b)  sanitary/environmental measures, including food
inspection, water supply, and sewage disposal;
(c)  epidemic disease control;
(d)  curative services (general out-patient clinic) including
minor surgery and simple laboratory tests (stool, urine,
blood);
(e)  maternal and child health care, including ante- and post-
natal care and child care up to school age (six years);
home delivery assistance and daily home visits during the
first week; referral of difficult labors to the nearest
hospital; rehydration;
(f)  family planning, mainly by means of oral contraceptives
and condoms and, in those RHUs where the staff is trained
and the equipment is available, IUD insertions;
(g)  school health service;
(h)  dentistry; and
(i)  pharmacy.



- 29 -
3.52      A RHU is normally staffed by one physician, two assistant nurses or
assistant midwives, one laboratory assistant, an assistant sanitarian, four
general service staff and one part-time dentist (para. 2.14).
3.53      Each RHU established under the project will be of a simple and
functional build, suitable to the community, and easy to maintain. Each RHU
will provide living quarters for two physicians and four assistant nurses.
3.54      Maternal and child health/general health center (MCH/GHC).  Egypt's
16.5 million urban population is provided with MCH/FP services through a net-
work of hospitals, health bureaus, and 220 MCH centers, each serving between
50,000 and 250,000 people. Under the first IDA project, nine MCH/GHCs, pro-
viding fully integrated MCH/FP services, were constructed in densely populated
urban areas. The MCH/GHCs offer the same basic health and MCH/FP services as
the RHUs. The second project will provide a further nine MCH/GHCs, each
serving a population of about 50,000 (see para. 2.14 for staffing).
3.55      The buildings will be simple and functional, and in harmony with
their surroundings..
3.56      Additional equipment for existing facilities.  Shortages of appro-
priate equipment (e.g., basic medical instruments and midwifery kits) and
inadequate transport are principal causes of the general underutilization of
Egypt's health facilities. The project will therefore provide 791 sets of
additional equipment for existing health facilities providing MCH/FP services
in the project area (one for each of 512 RHUs and 179 RHCs, and two sets for
each of the 50 MCH centers). These sets (each consisting of one IUD kit and
one obstetric set), along with additional in-service training of the medical
staff, will ensure that in the future all RHUs, RHCs and MCH centers in the
project area will possess the medical instruments and expertise needed to
perform IUD insertions.
3.57      Vehicles.  To improve the delivery of health and MCH/FP services
in rural areas, the project provides one simple ambulance/pick-up vehicle for
each of the 59 MCH centers (50 existing plus nine to be constructed under the
project) and 179 RHCs in the project area.
3.58      Fifty-seven station wagons will be provided for supervisors at the
district and governorate levels, except for the El-Wadi El-Gedid Governorate
(which is mainly desert), for which four four-wheel drive station wagons will
be provided.
3.59      All vehicles and equipment will be procured at the central MOH level,
by the Administrative Unit in the Department of Family Planning. This unit
will also be responsible for managing the implementation of all civil works
for the project in collaboration with the Architectural Unit. Staffing of the
new facilities will be arranged by the Director-General of Health Services in
each project Governorate.

Research and Evaluation
3.60      The formulation of population and family planning policy and the
management of the family planning program in Egypt has been hindered by the
absence of data. The project will therefore include the setting up of an
organization to promote research in the field of primary health care with
emphasis on MCH/FP, and of a system for the collection and processing of
MCH/FP data.
3.61      Research and Development Unit.  A Research and Development Unit
will be established in the Department of Family Planning, MOH. The work of
the Unit will be reviewed by the newly formed Project Coordinating Committee,
headed by the Minister of Health, which will supervise the execution of the
project. This committee will review and approve the procedures of the Unit
on a periodic basis, and the Unit's work program on a yearly basis (including
approval of all research contracts). The head of the Research and Development
Unit will be assisted by a professional staff of five: one economist, one
sociologist or social worker, one cultural anthropologist, one demographer-
statistician, and one epidemiologist. There will also be one editor, two
research assistants, and five clerks.
3.62      The functions of the Research and Development Unit will include:
(a) preparing and administering a research program
on primary health care with emphasis on MCH/FP
(projects under this program will be contracted
out to other institutions and agencies in Egypt);
(b) undertaking limited studies of problems affecting the
MOH's MCH/FP program (by Unit Staff);
(c) organizing a technical information service to store
and disseminate MCH/FP information drawn from the
experiences of other countries and other agencies;
(d) assisting the Statistical Unit in the MOH Department of
Family Planning in the design of a management information
system;
(e) evaluating data on fertility and maternal and child health
in the project Governorates on a continuing basis; and
(f) helping the Director-General for Family Planning to
set family planning targets in terms of numbers of
continuing users and new acceptors.
Costs of the Research and Development Unit include the costs of the Unit's
equipment, staff salaries, and other incremental recurrent costs, including
the costs of the external research program. The project will also provide
for fellowships for training abroad as follows: (a) for the Director, three



- 31 -
man-months (for training in research administration); and (b) eighteen man-
months in short-term fellowships for the Director and professional staff
(to acquaint themselves with MCH/FP research in other developing countries).
Fellowships for local training (60 man-months) will also be provided for
research staff of institutions participating in the external research program.
Provision will also be made for 30 man-months of foreign advisory services,
divided as follows: 12 man-months for planning and start-up assistance, and
18 man-months for short-term assistance in the drafting of terms of reference
for research projects to be contracted out.
3.63      Among the studies to be given priority in the Research and Develop-
ment Unit's external research program are the following:
(a) ways of obtaining more effective cooperation from
community leaders, traditional birth attendants, and
other part-time community health workers in MCH/FP work;
(b) ways of obtaining more effective field work and better
coordination between different programs and agencies;
(c)  the effects of large families on family health in Egypt;
(d) the use of the vital registration system for program
evaluation;
(e) improvement of the present crude means of estimating
contraceptive use;
(f) IEC research and evaluation (see para. 3.29);
(g) ways of encouraging the acceptance of alternative
clinical birth control methods;
(h) market research on ways of increasing the availability
of condoms and other nonclinical family planning methods;
and
(i)  trends in the age of marriage, the implications for health
resulting from pregnancy at an early age, and ways of raising
the age of marriage.
3.64      Fertility and MCH Data Systems.  An important task of the Research
and Development Unit will be to measure fertility and maternal and child
health in the project area. In this respect, Egypt has the advantage of a
well-established sytem of registration of births, operating through the health
system. In consultation with the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and
Statistics, the Unit will identify and correct sources of inaccuracy in the
present system, so that it can be used to monitor fertility trends (especially
high-risk births). The regularly reported data can be supplemented by samples.
This vital registration system also offers the best way of monitoring MCH



- 32 -
trends. Small sample surveys will be made periodically to estimate contra-
ceptive use. The first of these surveys will provide a better measure of
contraceptive use in the project area than can presently be derived from
service statistics, and will thus provide a benchmark for future evaluation
and a basis on which the Research and Development Unit can refine the pro-
gram's contraceptive use targets for the project area and undertake the
breakdown of these targets by Governorates and districts (para. 3.14). Funds
have been budgeted under the Project Preparation Facility for this survey and
for the initiation of research to improve methods for the concurrent measure-
ment of fertility and MCH trends (para. 4.10).
3.65      Statistical Unit.  Statistics on family planning services have been
collected by the MOH and EFPA, and tabulated and published by the PFPB, since
the beginning of the official program in 1966. However, they are limited to
quantities of contraceptives distributed. No information is gathered on a
regular basis on the numbers and characteristics of new family planning
acceptors or dropouts.
3.66      With project support, a new Statistical Unit will be created in
the Department of Family Planning of the MOH. The functions of this unit will
be: (a) to set up an adequate system for the collection of statistics on
family planning services rendered by ri'oii units; (b) to coLcCL iamlILy pianr.i.x6
statistics in accordance with this system on a continuous basis; and (c) to
prepare periodic reports based on this information for use in the day-to-day
management of the MOH family planning program.
3.67      In carrying out the above functions, the Statistical Unit will work
in coordination with the offices of the Directors of Health Services at the
governorate and district levels. There will be two full-time statistical
clerks in each Governorate, and one in each district, to ensure the collection
of family planning service statistics by MOH service units and the transmittal
of this information to the Statistical Unit. The Statistical Unit will also
draw on the resources of the Directorate of Statistics, MOH, which has overall
responsibility for collection of information on MOH programs. In particular,
since the Statistical Unit and its collaborators at governorate and district
levels will not be directly involved in the collection of MCH service statis-
tics, the Director-General for Family Planning will receive all the necessary
information on MCH services from the Directorate of Statistics, with the
Statistical Unit acting as a link. In the preparation of (a) above, the
Statistical Unit will be assisted by the Research and Development Unit.
Copies of the reports prepared by the Statistical Unit will be forwarded to
the PFPB, which will continue to tabulate and publish information on family
planning services provided by the MOH, EFPA and other private clinics, and on
contraceptives distributed through pharmacies and other commercial outlets.
Creation of the Statistical Unit in the Department of Family Planning would
facilitate revamping the system of collection of MOH family planning service
statistics. The Statistical Unit would be merged with the Directorate of
Statistics of the MOH after this initial phase.



- 33 -
3.68      The Statistical Unit will be headed by a senior statistician, pref-
erably to be seconded from the Directorate of Statistics of the MOH. He will
be assisted initially by two junior statisticians and three statistical
clerks, but additional staff will be added as needed after the patterns of
work of the Unit are clearly defined. Costs of the Statistical Unit will
include equipment, technical assistance, incremental salaries and other
incremental recurrent costs (e.g., the costs of printing data forms and
periodic reports). Technical assistance will comprise: (a) fellowships for
training abroad (three man-months) for the Unit Director; (b) fellowships for
study tours (12 man-months), to be utilized by the staff of the Statistical
Unit to familiarize themselves with family planning management information
systems in other developing countries; (c) fellowships for local training (one
man-month each) for the Statistical Unit collaborators at the governorate and
district levels; and (d) foreign advisory services (12 man-months) for the
development of the Unit's system of data collection. Funds have been budgeted
under the Project Preparation Facility to facilitate the prompt establishment
of the Statistical Unit (para. 4.10).
Support to the Egyptian Family Planning Association
3.69      The purpose of this component is to strengthen the capacity of the
EFPA to provide clinical and motivational services, especially in the project
area. A secondary purpose will be to strengthen the Alexandria Family Plan-
ning Training Institute. The project will accordingly:
(a) supply each of the 22 EFPA associations in the country
with a station wagon to enable voluntary and professional
workers to carry IEC and family planning services to
areas at present without easy access to MOH and EFPA
service units;
(b) provide the 94 EFPA family planning centers in the project
Governorates with needed furniture and equipment;
(c) provide the EFPA with two multi-purpose IEC vehicles for use
in the Delta, Cairo and Upper Egypt regions; and
(d) provide the Alexandria Family Planning Training Institute
with two station wagons, library facilities and equipment.
Innovative Activities
3.70      Experience in other countries (e.g., Bangladesh) has shown the need
to provide funds for the support of voluntary organizations and other innova-
tive activities, both in the public and private sectors, that may be developed
in the course of project implementation. These activities usually emerge as a
result of experience gained in project implementation, and as such they do not
lend themselves to appraisal at this stage. They can be, however, important
to overall program performance. Hence, funds amounting to about 4.5% of the
base project cost will be provided for this purpose. The same care and scru-
tiny of the Government's proposals for the utilization of these funds will be



- 34 -
exercised by IDA for the release of funds for these innovative activities as
for other project components. Examples of such innovative activities would
include community incentive schemes on an experimental basis, new approaches
to activities to encourage acceptance of family planning, etc. Except as IDA
otherwise agrees, proposals for the use of IDA funds under this item will be
agreed upon in advance of implementation between the Government and IDA. To
obtain IDA approval, proposals will have to meet the following five criteria:
(a) relevance to program objectives; (b) innovativeness; (c) the Credit is the
most appropriate source for financing the relevant activity; (d) feasibility
of administration and evaluation; and (e) replicability. IDA approval of
these proposals will be a condition of disbursement (para. 7.03).

for innovative activities.
IV. PROJECT COST, FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENT
A. Cost
4.01      The total estimated project cost is US$60.3 million equivalent, of
which US$20.9 million, or 34.6%, is foreign exchange. The foreign exchange
component has been calculated assuming 30% for construction; 70% for furni-
ture; 100% for equipment, special equipment and vehicles; 90% for technical
assistance; 30% for vehicle operation cost; and 50% for innovative activities.
Project cost estimates by expenditure categories are summarized in the follow-

4.02         The costs of construction,  furniture and equipment have been esti-
mated using March 1978 prices and are based on the experience of the MOH with
similar recently completed buildings. Cost estimates for special equipment
and vehicles are based on recent price quotations. Import duties amounting
to about US$3 million have been excluded from the cost estimates. About 75%
of project operating costs are salaries for incremental staff, which have
been costed according to standard Government schedules. The cost of tech-
nical assistance (excluding contingencies) was estimated as follows: (a) for
fellowships for study abroad, US$2,000 per man-month; (b) for fellowships
for study in Egypt, US$300 per man-month; (c) for local advisory services,
US$1,500 per man-month; and (d) for foreign advisory services, US$5,000 per
man-month. These figures include all expenses. The contingency allowance of
US$18.1 million includes: (a) physical contingencies for unforeseen factors



- 38 -
estimated at 15% of base civil works costs and 10% of furniture and equipment
and professional fees; and (b) price contingencies averaging 36.7% of the base
cost and physical contingencies. Price contingencies were calculated on the
basis of the project expenditure schedule and on the assumptions that (i)
local wages will increase annually by 15% over the whole project implementa-
tion period; (ii) prices for local materials will increase at the same rate
until 1980 and then slow down to 12% by 1982; and (iii) prices for all im-
ported goods will increase by 10% until 1979 and by 8% in the following three
years. Based on these assumptions, anticipated price increases between 1978
and 1982 for the main expenditure categories are as follows:

4.04      The MOH's current expenditure in FY1978 will amount to about LE 102
million, i.e., 3.9% of the total Government current expenditures in FY1978.
If the expenditure on health of other Government agencies, such as the Health
Insurance Organization, and the Pharmaceutical and Chemical Organization, is
added to that of the MOH, health accounts for 5.2% of current Government
expenditure in FY1978. This compares with 7.0% for Algeria (1973), 6.4% for
Morocco (1972), 5.1% for the Sudan (1973), and 6.4% for Ethiopia (1973).
The proposed project would add about LE 3.8 million at 1978 prices to MOH's
current expenditure in 1983, the first year after the project. This repres-
ents about 3.7% of MOH's current expenditure in 1978.  This increment seems
reasonable in view of the resources likely to be available to the MOH, the
proportion of the population to benefit from the project, and the high
priority assigned by the Government to the improvement of MCH/FP services.

B. Proposed Financing
4.05      The proposed four-year project would be financed by:  (a) an IDA
credit of US$25.0 million equivalent; (b) grants from the ODM, totaling
US$8.0 million equivalent; and (c) an Egyptian Government contribution of
US$27.3 million equivalent. Total foreign financing would cover the total
foreign exchange cost of US$20.9 million equivalent and 30.7%, or US$12.1
million equivalent, of the local cost.

4.06      The IDA credit would be granted on standard terms.  Details of the
proposed disbursement plan are given in Annex 2. ODM financing would be on a
parallel basis, and it would cover most items for the Minya Governorate and
EFPA, all kits for home visitors, and some IEC items at the central level.
The signing of the agreement with the ODM will be a condition of credit
effectiveness (para. 7.02(a)).



- 40 -
4.07      Local cost financing by IDA is recommended on country grounds.
Egypt's poverty level (GNP per capita in 1977 was US$310) and tight budgetary
situation make local cost financing appropriate. Considerable efforts have
been made in recent years in Egypt to increase public financing resources,
largely through taxation, and public revenues in 1976 were 41 percent of GNP.
Although Government revenue is expected to grow substantially during the
period of the 1978-82 Plan, the high level of Government current expenditures
will continue to absorb a large part of these resources. The mobilization of
domestic resources for Government investment is expected to remain a serious
problem.
4.08      In order to support the project administration, and to ensure that
certain key positions are adequately filled, salaries of a number of project
supervisory staff will be partially financed from the proceeds of the credit.
The credit will also be disbursed against salaries of the home visitors and
other staff of the home visiting program (about 90% of all credit funds dis-
bursed against salaries will be for this purpose), of the training and IEC
programs, and of certain specially recruited staff (such as a translator) in
the Department of Family Planning. Financing of salaries will allow the newly
established Department of Family Planning to be expanded to fulfill its new
responsibilities. Disbursement against salaries for the home visiting program
will allow close IDA involvement in this important component, which is on this
scale an activity new to Egypt, and extremely difficult to organize. Dis-
bursements from the credit against salaries will be on a declining scale
(para. 4.09), so as to reduce the impact on the Ministry of Health budget.
The Government will continue to employ these staff after disbursements are
completed (DCA, Section 3.01(b) and Schedule 1, paragraphs 1 and 2(c)).
C. Disbursement and Accounts

corresponding expenditure categories.
4.10      The MOH would maintain separate accounts reflecting all expenditures
on account of salaries under the project. Withdrawals of IDA and ODM funds
to reimburse for these expenditures will be made on the basis of certificates
of expenditures which shall specify the Project staff and their salaries on
account of which the withdrawal is requested. The MOH will retain, until one
year after the Closing Date of the credit, all records pertaining to such ex-
penditures and will enable IDA's representatives to examine such records.
IDA will examine certificates of expenditures pertaining to salaries in Minya

on behalf of ODM, and will advise ODM to make the corresponding payments.
The MOR will have the separate accounts pertaining to salaries audited for
each fiscal year by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and will furnish
to IDA a certified copy of the report of such audit not later than six months
after the end of each fiscal year.
D. Prolect Preparation Facility
4.11      At the request of the Government, IDA has approved an advance of up
to US$371,000 equivalent from the Project Preparation Facility to assist in
financing various steps necessary to expedite the preparation of the project
for which the current budget does not make provision.
4.12      The Project Preparation Facility advance will provide funds for:
(a) Architectural consulting services for the design of health
units and training centers;
(b) Consultants to prepare the IEC program and specifications
of audiovisual equipment;
(c) Supporting staff (contract translator, typist, etc.) for
the Project Executive Director in the planning stage;
(d) Initial design and production of IEC materials;
(e) Preparation of key staff for Training Centers and other
special training functions, including arrangements for
intensive travel/study abroad;
(f) Creation of a statistical unit and management information
system including services of local and foreign consultants;
(g) Research to provide baseline data and to improve methods for
the concurrent measurement of fertility and MCH trends; and
(h) Other initial studies on the health implications of re-
peated pregnancies, on the health implications of age at
marriage and first birth, and on optimal work patterns
for health service units.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND RISKS
A. Project Management
5.01      Under the Minister of Health, the First Undersecretary is respon-
sible for the overall administration of MOH activities. There are several
undersecretaries with responsibility for specific health sectors, e.g.,



- 43 -
preventive health, communicable disease control, primary health care, medical
care and hospitals, etc. Under these undersecretaries, there are various
directors-general responsible for specific programs, e.g., maternal and child
health, family planning, rural health, training, etc. The Director-General
for Family Planning reports directly to the First Undersecretary and through
him to the Minister of Health. The primary functions of the MOR include
policy-making, planning, setting standards, evaluating programs, and provid-
ing technical guidance to the Directors-General of Health Services at the
governorate level, who report directly to the Governors.  Program implementa-
tion is the responsibility of the Director-General at the governorate level.
5.02      The Director-General for Family Planning in the MOH has been
appointed Project Executive Director-General.  He will be assisted in the
day-to-day management of the project by an Assistant Project Executive
Director-General, and by a Program Adviser (an Egyptian national), who has
been specially appointed for the project, and who will be responsible for the
detailed planning of the software aspects of the project, including the home
visiting program, training, research and evaluation and IEC (Section 3.07 of
Credit Agreement) . The Project Executive Director-General's responsibilities
will include ensuring that components or subcomponents of the project to be
carried out by agencies outside the MOH, e.g., the MOIC and EFPA, are ade-
quately executed. The Senior Adviser on Family Health, acting on behalf of
the Minister, will also advise the Project Executive Director-General.
5.03      The coordination of the project components will be the responsi-
bility of a special Project Coordinating Committee, consisting of the Minister
of Health (Chairman), the Senior Adviser on Family Health, the First Under-
secretary of the MOH, the Director-General for Family Planning and the Program
Adviser.
5.04      The procurement of all equipment, vehicles and advisory services,
except those financed by the ODM, will be the responsibility of the Admin-
istrative Unit in the Department of Family Planning. To this effect, this
Unit will be strengthened by the appointment of a Procurement Officer. The
implementation of all civil works will be the responsibility of the Project
Architect (para. 5.11), with support from the Architectural Unit in the
Department of Family Planning.
5.05      To handle financial aspects of the project, the existing Financial
Section within the Administrative Unit will be strengthened by the addition
of a Financial Controller and two clerks. The Financial Controller will be
seconded from the Ministry of Finance. He will help in making budgeted funds
actually available for project payments, and will also be responsible for
keeping project accounts. A qualified Financial Controller will be appointed
not later than May 1, 1979 (para. 7.01(d)).
5.06      Other units in the Department of Family Planning will provide tech-
nical guidance for the relevant project components, i.e., the implementation
of the home visiting program and of the training component will be assisted by
the Program and Training Unit; and IEC activities by the Social Services and



- 44 -
Mass Communications Unit. The Program and Training Unit will also be respon-
sible for administration of all fellowships provided under the project. In
order to carry out project-related activities, the Program and Training Unit
will be strengthened by the appointment of three training specialists and a
Director of Home Visiting, with supporting staff. Two IEC specialists and
a Director of IEC Activities will be added to the Social Services and Mass
Communications Unit.
5.07      Consultants will be employed to advise on general program manage-
ment (4.0 man-years) and on the implementation of the IEC component (6.3 man-
years), training (2.0 man-years), and research and evaluation (3.5 man-years).
(See corresponding sections in Project Description for functions.)
5.08      Responsibility for the implementation of project activities at the
governorate level, with the exception of IEC activities (see para. 3.32),
will be assigned to the MCH/FP Unit in the Office of the Director-General for
Health Services (see para. 2.08). The staff of these units will be trained
for this purpose by the staff of the Department of Family Planning of MOH,
from whom they will also receive guidance during the execution of the project.
A full-time Project Assistant will be appointed in each project Governorate
to work with the Director-General of Health Services in all matters related
to project implementation in the Governorate.
5.09      Project support to project management will include salaries of
managerial and technical staff in the Department of Family Planning of MOH
and at the governorate level in the project Governorates. The project will
also provide funds for other incremental costs associated with project manage-
ment at the central and governorate levels (office stationery, duplicating
costs, etc.) and for four man-years of advisory services for general program
management (central level).
B. Implementation of Physical Facilities
5.10      The Project Executive Director-General has engaged, with financing
from the Project Preparation Facility, a Consultant Architect who will:
(a) review the schedules of accommodations for the four types of physical
facilities to be constructed under the project (RHUs, MCH centers, multi-
purpose training centers, and student accommodations in RHUs); (b) provide,
for IDA approval, preliminary type designs with layout of furniture and
built-in equipment for each of the four kinds of facilities, including cost
estimates and draft bid documents; (c) finalize the four type designs and
adjust bid documents in response to IDA's comments; and (d) assist the Project
Executive Director-General in formulating briefs and contracts for the Execu-
tive Architects and in selecting Executive Architects, sufficient in number
and capacity for final design and supervision of the 153 sites.



- 45 -
5.11      A Project Architect will be appointed to handle, on behalf of the
Project Executive Director-General, all project matters related to the imple-
mentation of the physical facilities. His major duties will be to: (a) pre-
pare the contracts for the services of Executive Architects and engineers;
(b) coordinate and assist the timely selection and acquisition of sites
according to agreed criteria; (c) review and revise the Executive Architects'
production plans and bid documents; (d) coordinate and arrange (in collabora-
tion with the Procurement Officer) bidding for civil works for all six Go-
vernorates, assist in bid evaluation and awarding single or package contracts
to the contractors; (e) initiate and supervise regular site meetings with
the architects and governorate officials to review progress and aid in cost
control; (f) prepare schematic quarterly progress reports and a completion
report, an English translation of which would be sent to IDA; (g) assist
the Procurement Officer in compiling and finalizing bid documents and contract
awards, for the supply of furniture and equipment and, as time allows, also
for special equipment and vehicles; and (h) assist the financial staff in
arranging payments to contractors and reimbursements from the donors. A
qualified Project Architect and a qualified Procurement Officer will be
appointed not later than May 1, 1979 (para. 7.01(c)).
5.12      The Project Executive Director-General, in consultation with IDA,
will select and employ firms of Executive Architects in the project Governor-
ates (preferably not more than one firm per Governorate) to: (a) assist the
governorate officials in the selection and acquisition of suitable sites and
comment in writing on the technical suitability of each site proposed for
selection; (b) employ and supervise all professionals needed for implementa-
tion and supervision of site and construction work; (c) develop, on the basis
of the Consultant Architect's type designs, the site-related final design and
work plans, furniture and equipment lists, cost estimates, implementation
schedules and bid documents, and assist the Project Architect in the bidding,
evaluating and contracting arrangements; (d) provide day-to-day supervision
of each site, verify contractors' certificates for payments, and report
monthly to the Project Architect on work progress, and on actions needed for
implementation; and (e) accept the completed work for handing over to the
users and provide a handbook for the planned use and maintenance of each
facility and its equipment.
5.13      The Government has undertaken to submit to IDA for its approval
the working drawings and draft bid documents for sites acquired by February
1, 1979, not later than August 1, 1979 (para. 7.01(b)).  The acquisition of
all sites will be completed not later than May 1, 1979 (para. 7.01(a)).
5.14      The Procurement Officer will handle all project-related procurement
matters (except for most ODM-financed items; see para. 5.18). He will,
in particular: (a) reassess in detail technical and users' requirements of
all goods to be procured under the project, and set standards for quality and
maintenance; (b) provide bid documents in consultation with IDA and in close
cooperation with future users, and arrange timely advertisements, prequalifi-
cations, bidding, bid evaluation and contract awards; (c) supervise supply,
acceptance and distribution of goods to users; and (d) assist the financial
staff in arranging payment to the suppliers and reimbursements from the
donors.

C. Procurement
5.15      Contracts for materials or furniture estimated to cost the equiva-
lent of US$150,000 or less, but more than US$10,000, and in the aggregate not
exceeding US$750,000 equivalent, will be awarded on the basis of local com-
petitive bidding in accordance with Government procurement procedures, which
are acceptable to IDA. Contracts for materials or furniture estimated to cost
more than US$150,000 equivalent, and for all vehicles and equipment except as
provided in (5.17) below, will be awarded on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Preference will
be accorded to local manufacturers of furniture and equipment at 15% of the
c.i.f. bid price of such goods, or the amount of customs duty and other import
taxes levied on a non-exempt importer, whichever is lower.
5.16      The buildings to be constructed under the project are small and
scattered over a large area, with an estimated unit cost of about US$8,000
for the student accommodations at RHUs, US$73,000 for the RHUs, US$205,000
for the MCH centers, and US$406,000 for the training centers. Hence, it is
not considered likely that foreign contractors who are not already established
in Egypt will show interest in participating. In view of this, contracts for
civil works will be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally and in accordance with Egyptian Government procedures, which are
satisfactory to IDA. Foreign contractors, however, will not be excluded from
bidding. Prequalification of all contractors would be required in advance of
bidding to ensure that only qualified firms submit tenders. To the extent
practicable, procurement will be based on bid packages, prepared in such a
way as to encourage competition.
5.17      Smaller items may be procured through local prudent shopping if
their aggregate does not exceed US$100,000 equivalent and individual purchases
do not exceed US$10,000 equivalent.
5.18      Procurement for ODM-financed civil works including built-in equip-
ment and furniture will be done on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally (para. 5.16). Procurement of other ODM-financed equipment and furni-
ture, and of ODM-financed vehicles and technical assistance, will be done
directly by ODM.
D. Flow of Funds
5.19      The project forms part of the 1978-82 National Five-Year Plan
approved by the People's Assembly in July 1978, and the Government accords it
high priority. Thus budgetary allocations for the project should be adequate.
The Government has undertaken that both the current and capital expenditures
needed for the project, both local and foreign, will be included in the annual
budgets during the project period (para. 7.01(i)).



- 47 -
5.20      So as to ensure that the project does not suffer, as did the first
project, from delays in making payments caused by slow processing within the
MOR, a financial controller will be seconded to the Department of Family
Planning from the Ministry of Finance. The Project Executive Director-General
will also have access to a cash account of LE 5,000, to be used as needed for
small payments of the kind which hindered the first project. This account
will be replenished as necessary, and its provision will be a condition of
effectiveness (para. 7.02(b)).
5.21      The parallel market exchange rate will be used for all purposes of
the project (para. 7.01(j)).
E. Risks
5.22      The project will be difficult to implement because close coopera-
tion and coordination, which were not demonstrated in the past, will be
required among the MOH, MOIC, EFPA and PFPB. However, this risk will be
diminished by the fact that all of these agencies are represented in the
High Committee for Family Planning (para. 2.06). In the case of the IEC
component, this risk will be further reduced by the establishment of the
Communications Action Coordinating Committee (para. 3.32). Moreover, the
project proposal has already been approved by the Supreme Council for Family
Planning.
5.23      Another crucial element is the need for the prompt training of
doctors and nurses, who, at present, are ill prepared for an integrated
MCH/FP program. The MOH plans to start this training immediately, using
existing resources (para. 3.47).
5.24      As indicated by the experience of the first project, there is
also the risk that funds will not be made available to the project in adequate
amounts in a timely fashion. The Government, however, has undertaken that:
(a) both current and capital expenditures for the project, local and foreign,
will be included in the annual budgets during the project period (para.
7.01(i)); and (b) a project cash account from which the Project Executive
Director-General could draw funds for the project will be established and
continually replenished by the Government at a level of about LE 5,000.
Establishent of this cash account is a condition of effectiveness (para.
7.02(b)).
5.25      Effective implementation of the project may also be hindered by
the lack of relevant managerial experience at the central and local levels.
This risk will be reduced by the inclusion in the project of training for
senior staff and of advisory services for project planning and implementation.

VI.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The target of the Egyptian Government is to reduce the CBR by one
point per thousand per year up to 1982. Assuming that in 1977 the CBR re-
mained at its 1975-76 level of about 36 per thousand, a fall of the CBR at
the target rate from 1978 onwards would result in a CBR of 31 per thousand by
1982. Provided that the use of non-program contraceptive methods remained
unchanged, the attainment of this result would require an increase in the
number of continuing users from an estimated 1,050,000 couples in 1977 to
about 2,000,000 in 1982 for the nation as a whole. If the CBR were reduced
to about 31 per thousand by 1982, and if subsequent years witnessed a steady
decline (although at a lower annual rate) in the CBR as projected in Table 2,
a net reproduction rate of 1.0 would be reached about the year 2005. Under
these assumptions, the population of Egypt in the year 2000 would be about 11
million less than if fertility remained at the the 1975-76 level.
6.02      The project is expected to make an important contribution to efforts
to reduce fertility in an area of the country which contains about 26% of the
country's total population. The project components have been designed to
remedy weaknesses in the MCH/FP program. The project would mark a turning
point in the history of efforts to reduce the rate of growth of population in
Egypt. In effect, it can be viewed as the means whereby the MOH will at last
become responsible for a comprehensive MCH/FP program. Although at first this
program will be confined to part of the country only, its success would
provide a model for other Governorates.
6.03      To a smaller extent, the project would also enhance the prospects
of fertility reduction in the other Governorates, since some of its components
would be nationwide in scope, e.g., the strengthening of the organization of
the Department of Family Planning in the MOH, and the formulation, for the
first time in Egypt, of a comprehensive IEC plan for MCH/FP.
6.04      It is difficult to make an estimate of the resources devoted to
reduction of population growth in Egypt, since so much of the effort is pro-
vided through the ordinary health services. It is however certain that the
program at present in operation is far too small in terms of the seriousness
of the problem. The project will go some way to redress this situation, at
any rate in those Governorates where most project activities will be concen-
trated. The resulting increase in family planning activities in those
Governorates would be very large, but still within local and central MOH
capabilities. A similar simultaneous increase of family planning activities
in the rest of the country would put too large a burden on the central MOH
implementation capacity, and in any case should probably not be attempted
until experience has been gained under this project. For this reason, a
phased approach to stepping up family planning activities throughout the
country has been chosen by the Government. The IEC program will, even after
the project, be on a smaller scale than in many countries--proportionally to
population size. However, there are limits to the rate at which expansion is
feasible, both for administrative reasons and due to the danger of an adverse
reaction.



- 49 -
6.04      Since the strengthening (and, to a limited extent, the extension) of
the health delivery system is the principal means of attaining the objectives
of the project, it is inevitable that the health system itself will be a
principal beneficiary of the project. In particular, an improvement of MCH
services in the project governorates, which contain about 1.5 million married
women of reproductive age, would be a very important consequence which would
help to promote family planning by helping to encourage mothers to have fewer
children.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The Government has undertaken that:
(a) it will acquire all sites required for the construction
of the health facilities, training centers, and student
quarters not later than May 1, 1979 (para. 5.13);
(b) it will present to IDA for approval the working drawings
and draft bid documents for sites acquired by February 1,
1979, not later than August 1, 1979 (para. 5.13);
(c) it will appoint a Project Architect and a Procurement
Officer on terms and conditions agreed between the
Government and IDA, not later than May 1, 1979 (para. 5.11);
(d) it will appoint a Financial Controller for the project,
not later than May 1, 1979 (para. 5.05).
(e) it will recruit home visitors for the project according to
criteria agreed between the Government and IDA, and it will
develop a detailed plan for the implementation, supervision
and evaluation of the home visiting program on terms and
conditions agreed between the Government and IDA not later
than May 1, 1979 (para. 3.40);
(f) it will prepare a nationwide four-year IEC plan of action
and send it for review to IDA not later than May 1, 1979
(para. 3.33);
(g) it will furnish to IDA for its review outline training
programs for the Multipurpose Training Centers described
in paras. 3.44 to 3.47 (para. 3.47);
(h) it will establish a Committee for the coordination of the
IEC activities to be carried out under the project by the
MOH, MOIC, and EFPA, not later than May 1, 1979 (para. 3.32);



- 50 -
(i) it will ensure that the foreign and local current and
capital expenditures needed for the project will be
included in the annual budgets during the project period
(para. 5.19); and
(j) it will accept use of the parallel market exchange rate
for all purposes of the project (para. 5.21).
7.02      The following will be special conditions of effectiveness:
(a) the signing of the cofinancing agreement with the ODM
(para. 4.06);
(b)  establishment of a project cash account from which the
Project Executive Director-General could draw funds for
the project and which would be continually replenished
by the Government at a level of about LE 5,000 (para. 5.20).
7.03      For activities to be financed under the innovative activities com-
ponent, no funds will be disbursed unless IDA has approved the activity be-
fore its implementation, according to the criteria listed in para. 3.70.
7.05      With the assurances and conditions indicated above, the project
is suitable for an IDA credit of US$25 million equivalent to the Government
of Egypt on standard IDA terms.
