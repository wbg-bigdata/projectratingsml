MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPIMENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE RUSSL4IN FEDERATION
FOR
A PORTIFOLIO DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to Russia of US$40 million equivalent to help finance a project for Portfolio Development.
It would strengthen external resource management and increase the Government's capacity to identify,
prepare and implement projects expected to be financed by the Bank. The loan would be at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace.
ackground
In November 1994, the Russian Government announced that its ambitious reform program
would enter a second stage. The first phase had focussed on aggressive privatization of state-run
enterprises and small businesses combined with a moderate stabilization program. The Government is
now determined to support a radical plan to lower monthly inflation from an average of 9.3 percent in
1994 to about 1 percent by end-1995. The Government's aim is to increase private investment in
domestic industry and improve the standard of living. TMe plan is predicated on deeper structural
reforms, an austere 1995 budget, and greater reliance on internal and external borrowing to close the
budget gap.
3.           The success of this program will depend in part on the Government's continued ability
to mobilize substantial external financing over the next several years. The bulk of this support is
expected to come from debt rescheduling and official bilateral and multilateral sources until private flows
increase significantly. The international community has shown its willingness to provide financing in line
with Russia's progress in reforms, primarily through generous debt rescheduling but also export credits,
grant technical assistance and official finance. Competition for grant technical assistance is expected to
increase as the availability of these resources to Russia declines. Therefore, the Government will also
need to increase borrowing for technical assistance, particularly to prepare public investment projects for
external financing.
4.           Both the Russian and bilateral governments view the Bank as a critical catalyst for
investment resources in support of Russian structural reforms. At the request of the Prime Minister, the
Bank has expressed its readiness to prepare an expanded annual lending program of US$2.5-3.0 billion
over the next several years. However, commitments of this magnitude require both a sustained reform
effort and significant improvement in the pace of project preparation and implementation. The
partnership between the Bank and the Government has strengthened and there is better understanding of
the role of international investment in the transition process. Nevertheless, despite the efforts devoted
by both sides to develop the Bank's portfolio, actual implementation has fallen short of initial
expectations. This reflects, on one hand, start-up difficulties in lending to a new borrower, and on the
other hand, systemic issues that constrain implementation and disbursements.
5.           Atthe first annual Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR), held September 16-17,
1994, the Bank's Governor noted that the starting point for improved project implementation was close
alignment of Government reform priorities and Bank projects. He stressed that Russian capacity to
identify and prepare its borrowing program needed to be strengthened, and that greater integration of the
Bank program into the Government's investment planning process was essential. At the same time, the



-2-
Government would like to increase the advisory role of the Bank in its relations with the Govemment.
In order to make the partnership between the Government and the Bank even more effective, the
Government plans to strengthen various agencies responsible for coordination with the Bank. An
important role in this regard will be given to the newly-established Federal Center for Project Finance
and Technical Assistance (the "Center"). In addition, the CPPR concluded that greater efforts were
needed to ensure that sectoral ministries and implementing agencies play a substantive role in project
design.
6.           Until recently, responsibility for interacting with external sources of assistance has been
dispersed among several committees and ministries and coordinated only partially by departments of
international finance in the Government administration and Ministry of Finance. The Government has
recognized that the fragmentation of authority has constrained its ability to mobilize new resources and
manage existing commitments effectively. In addition, institutional capacity to identify suitable projects
for external financing is limited. At the same time, sector ministries are moving away from direct
involvement in project execution and assuming a greater policy formulation and monitoring role. While
project management skills need to be developed in implementing agencies, the CPPR concluded that many
specialized tasks such as project design and procurement should be contracted out where possible to
Russian and international consulting firms. There is thus a particular need to support the development
of the local consulting industry.
7.           The Center, established in April 1994 by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, is focussed on
three primary functions: coordination, information dissemination, and advisory services. Specifically,
it will: a) match Government investment priorities with official external financing sources and support
the preparation of investment proposals by governmental organizations; b) advise and assist sectoral
ministries and implementing agencies on the practices and procedures of external financing sources and
monitor project implementation; and c) support the development of the local consulting industry and
advise Russian businesses on procurement opportunities in externally-financed projects. The Govermnent
has confirmed that the Center would be responsible for day-to-day working-level coordination activities
with the Bank.
Governoent's Objectives and Strateg
8.           The Goverment's objective is to improve its ability to mobilize, coordinate and utilize
external resources in support of the second stage of its economic reform progran. It believes that
preparation of a sound pipeline of projects for Bank financing, which could also serve as a catalyst for
other financial flows, is central to this effort. For 1995 alone, Russian ministries and agencies have
proposed more than 60 projects to the Goverrment for financing by the Bank, requiring resources far in
excess of the estimated borrowing program. The Government recognizes that an efficient process is
needed to identify investment priorities and match them with external sources of funding. Greater
collaboration is also required to develop consensus with external agencies on priorities for assistance and
to address project-specific implementation constraints. All these objectives would be supported by the
proposed operation.
9.           In addition, the Govermnent recognizes that the introduction of competitive procurement
procedures in initial Bank projects has led to substantial cost savings. Participation by Russian suppliers
also provided strong financial incentives for enterprises to restructure and improve product quality. The
Govermnent believes that efforts to mtroJuce competitive bidding practices within the economy can be
facilitated by stimulating greater participation by potential Russian suppliers and contractors in the bidding



-3-
process on internationally-financed projects. For this reason, the Government has established a Business
Opportunities Bureau within the Project Center that would also be supported by the proposed project.
Bank Strategy and Rationale for Involvement
10.          The proposed loan is central to fulfillment of the Bank's country assistance strategy (CAS)
discussed on May 19, 1994 during consideration of the Financial Institutions Development Project. As
mentioned in the CAS, a key Bank objective is to establish the Bank as a trusted partner of the
Government in carrying out its reform objectives. The proposed loan will be a central instrument to
achieve this objective, first, by increasing Russian ownership of its borrowing program and second, by
ensuring rapid results through improved implementation capacity. More generally, the project will help
ensure that all external resources are used as eff.ectively as possible. These are essential prerequisites if
external resources are to contribute to the success of economic reforms. The lack of a clearly identified
counterpart agency at. te central level has hampered the dialogue on priorities for external assistance and
implementation issues. The proposed loan would thus also support improved arrangements for
collaboration and project implementation while developing the local consulting industry, which would
contribute to the sustainability of results.
11.          The proposed loan will primarily provide a flexible source of financing for the
development of high-priority investmnent projects that are integrated with the Govermnent's reform
program. The initial projects in the Bank's lending program have been prepared with resources from the
Technical Cooperation Program (ICP), the Project Preparation Facility (PPF), and substantial grant
funding. The TCP has been terminated, PPF resources are limited, and grant iiiancing for technical
assistance to Russia is expected to decline. Reliance on PPF funding and p' t .es* irces for all project
preparation activities is, in any event, not a practical option for a count *' th    reL ald expanding
lending program such as Russia (potentially 9-10 projects, totaling up to   t.  billion per year).
The three-year lending program is presently estimated to require up to  s$25 million in technical
assistance to prepare beyond what is available from other sources. Grant resources would be used first
where suitable and readily available. The funds would only support the preparation of Bank projects
since the EBRD, which is the only other major multilateral source of investment financing, has access
to EU grant funds, including for project preparation.
Project Objectives
12.          The project has three objectives:
(a) Develop a sound pipeline of projects suitable for Bank financing;
(b) Strengthen institutional capacity in Russia for extenal resource management and
project identification, preparation and implementation; and
(c) Develop the local consulting industry and advise Russian businesses about
procurement opportunities in externally-financed projects.
Project Dscription
13.          The project's three components are designed to meet the above objectives:



-4-
(a) Fund for Project Preparation (US$25 million), which would finance the preparation
of projects in the next three years' lending program as agreed between the Government
and the Bank, including through technical and sector studies, engineering designs, and
analyses of economic, financial and environmental feasibility. A small amount of
financing would support Lhe operational start-up costs of PPIUs and the execution of pilot
projects as part of project preparation activities.
(b) Technical assistance to strengthen external resource management and project
preparation and implementation capacity (US$7.0 million). This component would
primarily strengthen the coordination, infnrmation dissemination and advisory capacity
of the Center in its dealings with implementing and core agencies and the business
community. It would also strengthen critical project skills (such as procurement,
disbursement, accounting, project management) in implementing agencies and debt
management capacity in the Ministry of Finance. Additional activities would be
identified as external resource management functions evolve in Govermnent. Financing
would be available for consultant services, information and communications technology
and related equipment, training and study tours.
(c) Establishment of a Business Opportunities Bureau in the Federal Center for Project
Finance (US$7.5 million). The Bureau's primary purpose is to advise enterprises,
manufacturers and consultants on the opportunities and requirements tor participating in
competitive bidding on externally-financed projects. It would advertise tenders to
Russian consulting firms, contractors and potential exporters, conduct business
opportunities' seminars in Moscow and regional economic centers, and assist interested
suppliers and contractors with bid preparation through training programs. Financing
would be available for consultant services to: (i) develop and deliver training and
business outreach programs; and (ii) design and develop a data system on potential
bidders among Russian consulting firms and enterprises. The loan would also finance
minor civil works to restructure and refurbish the Bureau's facilities.
14.          An illustrative list of subprojects under the three components, which were discussed and
agreed at negotiations, is attached as Appendix I to the Technical Annex. A summary of key project
activities including the Government's objectives, actions, benchmarks (outputs) and timetables is presented
in Appendix I.
Project Implementation and Fiancig Plan
15.          Federl Center for Project Fumce and Teclmical Assistance. The Center would be
responsible for overall project implementation. It was established in April 1994 by Government
ordinance as a governmental body but with independent legal status. The Prime Minister appoints the
Center's Chairman, who reports to the First Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Management. The
First Deputy Prime Minister is also the Chairman of the Interministerial Commission that approves the
external borrowing program of the Government, including from the Bank. Key management positions
in the Center have been filled with highly qualified personnel. Staff recruitment, presently underway,
is expected to reach 226 positions over time, of which 146 would be professional. A total of 60
professional and support staff are presently in place. The Center is organized into six departnents,
including Technical Assistance, Project Finance, the Business Opportunities Bureau, Infornation Services,
Finance and Administration. The Technical Assistance Departnent includes staff drawn from the



-5-
European Union technical assistance advisory unit, formerly part of the former Russian Agency for
International Cooperation and Development (RA[CD). The regulations, organizational chart and reporting
lines, estimated staffing plan and draft 1995 budget of the Center are in Appendices Vl-IX of the
Technical Annex.
16.          Over time, the Center will acquire the capacity to support the identification, preparation,
implementation, and evaluation of externally-assisted projects. The proposed project will help accelerate
this process by financing expert advisory services to the Center as well as information and
communications technology and equipment. The Center will require expert assistance over the next two-
three years to build capacity, particularly in project management, procurement and accounting and
auditing. To a certain degree, this can be acquired through training courses offered by EDI and the Joint
Vienna Institute Program, or financed by the UK Know-How Fund in procurement. In addition, Center
staff would be invited to participate in Bank appraisals to acquire on-the-job experience. For more in-
depth training and assistance during project implementation, the TA component will include financing for
resident advisors for periods of up to two years. The advisors may, int  alia: a) provide advice on
project analysis and evaluation; b) advise on development of appropriate procurement plans for externally-
financed projects; c) help develop appropriate procedures to monitor disbursements or for selection of
project auditors; and d) assist in providing advice to PPIUs on procurement, disbursement and project-
level accounting. Technical assistance inputs to support project implementation, particularly to the
Project Center, are surmnarized in Appendix XI of the Technical Annex.
17.          General Arrangements and Implmentation Status. Implementation arrangements for
the project are outlined in Appendix EII to the Technical Annex. They emphasize~ the Center's role as
coordinator within Govermment of the Bank's program. All technical activities related to subprojects
would be decentralized to implementing or core agencies, as appropriate. The Center would also assure
that work on the Bank's program throughout the project cycle is in line with broader coordination and
loan processing arrangements developed between the Government and the Bank. The Implementation
Plan (Appendix XIII) includes a Project Launch Workshop, a workshop for implementing agencies, and
emphasis on actions to build the Center's capacity in the first half of 1995. Progress with the
coordination and loan processing arrangements will be reviewed at the next CPPR in September 1995.
A Mid-Term Review is planned in February 1996.
18.          The successful implementation of the proposed project depends primarily on the broader
dialogue on coordination and implementation arrangements between the Bank and Government. These
matters were the subject of the first CPPR in September 1994. The Agreed Action Plan to Improve
Implementation, adopted by the CPPR, is attached as Appendix V to the Technical Annex. All of the
short-term actions have been completed on time. The most important of these was the drafting of
coordination and loan processing arrangements, which were discussed and accepted by both sides during
negotiations on the proposed loan and attached to the minutes of negotiations. The first medium-term
action will be for the Government's Interministerial Commission for International Economic Relations
to review the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) in April 1995. The Project Center's first
responsibility is to play a key role in the preparation of the documentation for the Commission's
discussions. With the assistance of the key core ministries, it will review and make recommendations on
the Bank's three-year lending program in light of Government development objectives and investment
priorities. The outcome of the CAS discussions will lay the basis for implementation of the proposed
loan beginning around April 1995. The Project Center as presently staffed is capable of carrying out this
responsibility as well as implementation of the FPP components. Subproject preparation (funded by the
FPP) would be the responsibility of the technical ministries. Activities under the FPP are sufficiently



-6-
independent of those under the component to strengthen the Project Center that both can be implemented
in parallel fashion. However, the Center intends to act quickly to strengthen its ability to advise and
assist technical ministries during the project cycle and to initiate operations of the Business Opportunities
Bureau. During negotiations, the Russian Delegation agreed that the highest priorities for near-term action
were: a) procurement of expert services for the Center in the areas of procurement, disbursement,
accounting/auditing and staff planning and development; b) refurbishment of the premises of the Business
Opportunities Bureau; and c) acquisition of additional office equipment for the Center.
19.          Fund for Projed Preparation (US$25 miUlion).  Under the first component, line
ministries (in consultation with the Bank) would present requests for FPP financing to the Center, which
would review them for consistency with the Government's investment priorities as agreed with the Bank
in the Country Assistance Strategy. Subproject proposals mutually approved by the Government and the
Bank would receive an allocation from the loan. The line ministry would handle all technical aspects of
the subprojects and would contract consultants and procure equipment. The Center would monitor
subproject processing and disbursements and provide advice when needed to Project Preparation and
Implementation Units (PPIUs) on Bank procedures, particularly on procurement, disbursement and
accounting.
20.          External Resource Management (US$7.0 million). The second component would be
primarily focussed on increasing capacity in external resource management in the Center and in
implementing agencies, particularly in procurement, project-level accounting, disbursement and project
management. It would be managed by the Center. The only exceptions would be subprojects to
strengthen external resource management in other core agencies, which woula be managed by those
agencies. The principal such subproject would be to build up debt management capacity in the Ministry
of Finance. Others have been tentatively identified and are included in the Key Project Activities in
Appendix II. These will be developed in view of evolving needs in external resource management. All
of these activities will make maximum use of grant-financed TA (such as procurement training financed
by the UK Know-How Fund and EDI or project management training provided by EDI).
21.          Busiess Opportunities Bureau (US$7.5 milon). The third component, to establish a
Business Opportunities Bureau, would be managed entirely by the Center. The Bureau is being
established in response to a concern by the Govermment that Russian firms and enterprises with the
capability of exporting or bidding on consultant contracts are currently either unaware of market access
mechanisms or are hindered by an inability to comply with quality or other requirements. Approximately
US$4 million has been allocated to help the Bureau develop a data base on potential bidders and to
undertake business outreach programs, including seminars, and training programs in the field of
international trade and procurement to firms, enterprises and foreign trade organizations. An estimated
US$3.5 million would help finance the refurbishment of the Bureau's preriises. Bureau activities are
listed as subprojects in Appendix I and described in more detail in Appendix X of the Technical Annex.
22.          Fancing Plrn. The total financing required is US$79.5 million, of which the Bank
would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange and 50 percent of the total. Since development of the
local consulting industry is a key project objective, the Bank expects to finance local expenditures for
consultant services, primarily but not exclusively related to Droject preparation. The Government
contribution includes US$26.7 million in operating costs, US$2.7 million in equipment purchases and
US$7.2 million for renovation of Center facilities. The draft budget for the Center for 1995 is at
Appendix IX of the Technical Annex. The Government has requested and will receive an Advance from
the Project Preparation Facility of US$0.5 million to prepare the technical assistance needed to strengthen



-7-
the Center. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Russian Federation are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively.
Lessons-of Experience
23.          This is the first such loan to Russia. It has been designed with the Bank's experience to
date in Russia. As with all new borrowers, unfamiliarity with Bank procedures and official finance in
general has slowed project start-up and thus disbursements. Consequently, the project stresses up-front
actions to strengthen project preparation and implementation capacity. The Center will ensure the early
establishment of project preparation and implementation units and training of ministry staff in project-
level accounting and procurement. It will aeso facilitate the procurement process by providing in-depth
information to potential Russian bidders on international tenders. More broadly, the project will support
the Action Plan to Improve Implementation, agreed to at the CPPR in September 1994. The thrust of
this plan is to build borrower ownership, which has been identified as a key factor in successful projects.
24.          Bank experience in technical assistance projects more generally has also been considered
in the design of this loan'. The project has narrowly focussed and clear objectives, streamlined
procedures for approval of subprojects, and on-the-job training for Center staff to ensure the rapid
acquisition of project management skills.
Procurement and Disbursement
25.          All procurement of goods and services will be carried out according to the Bank's
guidelines and using the standard bidding documents of the Bank (for details, see paragraphs 31-32 of
the Technical Annex). A single Special Account will be established in a commercial bank acceptable
to the Bank under the control of the Center to handle disbursements of project funds (other than direct
payments) for all subprojects.
Environmental Issues
26.          This is a category "C" project since it only involves the financing of consultant services,
study tours, training and office equipment. The Fund for Project Preparation would be available for
preparing environmental projects or components, if considered a priority for the Government and the
Bank. Feasibility studies would incorporate environmental assessments or impact studies in their terms
of reference, whenever warranted.
Agreed Actions
27.          At negotiations, the Bank and Government agreed on the illustrative list of subprojects
(Appendix I of the Technical Annex). The criteria and description of proposed subprojects must meet
the specifications laid out in the Loan Agreement. As part of the agreed Implementation Program, the
Government will submit all subproject proposals to the Bank for approval. Each must contain detailed
financial implementation and procurement arrangements, as specified in the Loan Agreement.

Noveniber 1991; and O.D. 8.40, 'Technical Assistance," July 1992.

Project Benefils and Risks
28.          The principal benefit of the operation will be to ensure the timely preparation and
implementation of critical investment operations in support of the reform program. Of equal importance,
it will enhance Russian ownership of its borrowing program by building up the Government's institutional
capacity to identify, prepare and implement projects financed by external resources. The project would
also increase efficiency in Russia by developing the local consulting industry and by helping domestic
firms participate in tenders on externally-financed projects. Exposure to international competitive bidding
will help Russian firms become more familiar with the trading practices, quality standards and pricing
of products and services for sale on world markets.
29.          The major risks are slow or inefficient utilization of funds. These could res ilt from
unfaniliarity with procedures relating to procurement, disbursement and subproject approval; changes
in the role of, or institutional weaknesses in, the Bank's new counterpart; or political developments
affecting Government investment priom .ies. These factors would also affect the Bank's ability to deliver
the FY96-98 lending program as planned. The loan design includes measures to strengthen procurement
and disbursement skills and a broad implementation framework that is accepted by all key institutional
actors in Government. One component of the project will primarily strengthen the Center. In addition,
the Moscow Resident Mission will ensure close collaboration during project implementation. However,
political risks that dramatically alter either investment priorities or institutional collaboration arrangements
with the Bank cannot be mitigated entirely by the project.
Recommendation
30.          I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
