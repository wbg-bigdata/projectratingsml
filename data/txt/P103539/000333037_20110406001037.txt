           B. SUMMARY
    1.     As Per recommendations outlined in the Mid-term review (carried out in June
    2010), and following those of a Quality Assessment Lending Portfolio (QALP) carried
    out in May 2010, the team reviewed the outcome indicators, the reallocation of funds per
    components and the necessity to extend the current project closing date. Below are the
    proposed changes :

    The following outcome indicator (Increase in the drainage relief capacity of the East
    Demerera Water Conservancy "EDWC" to the Demerara River by 35% by end of the
    Project) will be dropped to reflect the reality of the project activities which focused
    essentially on providing technical engineering baseline for future interventions designed
    to reduce flood vulnerability.

    Unused funds will be reallocated from component 2 to component 1 to cover the cost of
    the engineering study. As a result, the Disbursement table on Section IV.A.2 of Schedule
    2 of the Grant Agreement will be amended to reflect these changes. The Proposed
    government financed Cunha Canal's work has been withdrawn from the project and will
    be considered as a stand-alone project.

    Project closing date should be extended from June 30, 2011, to March 31, 2013 to
    complete all the activities of the study as some of them are season related.


       C PROJECT STATUS
    2       Overall the project has performed moderately satisfactorily with 18.70% of the
    funds disbursed. The Project implementation is built around six main contracts of which
    five have been awarded. The main contract for the project (US$ 2.6 M) was signed on
    February 14, 2011.There are no outstanding audit, financial management, procurement,
    or safeguards issues.


       D. PROPOSED CHANGES

          Results/indicators

           The following outcome indicator (Increase in the drainage relief capacity of the
           East Demerera Water Conservancy "EDWC" to the Demerara River by 35% by
           end of the Project) will be dropped to reflect the reality of the project activities
           which focused essentially on providing technical engineering baseline for future
           interventions designed to reduce flood vulnerability.

  Budget is revised to cover the cost of the engineering study contract (component 1 @US$ 2,682.809). A
total of US$ 700,000 was taken from component 2 to reach the contract sum.
3
  Amount was taken out of the Budget in light of the fact that DFID has withdrawn its funding for the
Cunia Canal.
4
  This amount is added to the budget to cover the cost of an engineer who will supervise implementation of
the services under component 1.
