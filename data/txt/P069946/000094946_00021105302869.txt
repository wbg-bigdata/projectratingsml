1.0   INTRODUCTION
1.1   Terms of Reference
1.1. 1  The Terms of Reference for this studyv are presented in Annex 6 issued bv The World
Bank entitled "Environmental Assessment of Proposed Sewerage Project and Effluent
Re-use" dated 26 August 1991.
1.1.2  In preparing this Environmental Assessment. reference has been made to. the
requirements of The World Bank Operational Directive OD4.01. of October 1991
entitled "Environmental Assessment. "Environmental Assessment of the Investment
Projects and Programme. Scope and Process" by J.A.N. Wallis. published by the
Economic Development Institute of the World Bank in December 1989, and
"Environmental Assessment Sourcebook" published by the Worid Bank Environment
Department (Technical Papers 139, 140 and 154) in 1991.
1 .1.3  This report does not cover the construction of the factories for the manufacture of the
pipes necessary for the Tehran Sewerage Project. or the supply of raw materials for
the factories. The Executive Summary of this environmental assessment report is
published as a separate document.
1.2    Objectives of the Environmental Assessment
1.2.1  The objective of this environmental assessment is to identify negative environmental
effects, if any, of the proposed project, and to recommend mitigative measures to
address such concerns. It is a component of the Project Feasibility Study required for
appraisal by the World Bank. This report accompanies and draws upon the "Review
of Sewage Treatment Process Alternatives" draft report issued by Acer John Taylor
and Ray-Ab Consulting Engineers in June 1992 which provides technical details and a
cost assessment of the proposed project.



2.0    PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2. I    Outline of the Project
2.1.1   For the purposes of the Environmental Assessment (EA), the Project Area is defined as
the northern and southern parts of the City of Tehran (including Shahr-e-Rev) with a canal
to Varamin Plain. Drawing EA/I shows the relative locations of Tehran and the Varamin
Plain.
2.1.2   Tehran comprises of 20 Municipalitv regions with a total population of about 8 million, as
shown on Drawing EA/2.
2.1.3   The Master Plan for Sewage Management proposes that sewage from Tehran be conveyed
by a sewerage svstem to two sewage treatment plants (STPs). one to the south of the City
and the other to the west of the City. Drawing EA/3 shows the main trunk sewers and the
locations of the two treatment plants.
2.1.4   The Plan has been divided into two stages. The first stage includes a western main trunk
sewer and an eastern main trunk sewer. connecting to the southern treatment plant,
together with interceptor, branch and lateral sewers to serve 5.000 hectares in Northern,
1,500 hectares in Central. and 10.000 hectares in Southern Tehran. Drawing EA/4 shows
the first stage which is covered by the Project.
2.1.5   The second stage proposals include an east to w est trunk sewer, the westem treatment
plant and sewers to serve the remaining areas of Tehran.
2.1.6   Treated effluent from the treatment plants is to be used for agricultural irrigation. For the
southem treatment plant (STP), it is proposed that the treated effluent is used, in
conjunction with river and groundwater sources. for irrigation in the existing Varamin
Irrigation Scheme. Sludge from the treatment plants is also to be used for agricultural
purposes.
2.1.7  It is proposed that the Stage I works be completed. with the exception of house
connections. by the year 2001 and all other major activities in the Project by 2005.
Existing Situation
2.1.8   There is a number of existing sewage treatment plants in operation in Tehran but these
serve a very small proportion of the total population (800.000 out of 8 million).
2.1.9   The most common method of sewage disposal is by means of sewage wells. These are
constructed beneath or adjacent to properties and receive all foul sewage flows. They
comprise of a vertical shaft. at the bottom of which is an enlarged chamber. Polluted water
infiltrates into the ground and solid matter degrades in the chamber.
2.1.10  In some areas. the water table is too high for effective operation of sewage wells. In these
areas and also where surface water drains are conveniently located. sewage is discharged
directly to the surface water drainage system.
2.1.11 The consequences of the existing sewage disposal system are most apparent in the south
of the City. Here. infiltrated water from the northern areas and surface drainage flows
2



combine to cause major problems with flooding. waterlogging. and pollution. All of these
problems present a major threat to public health.
2.1.12 The public health problem is further compounded by the widespread use of water from the
heavily polluted surface water drainage svstem. in particular the Firouzabad and Sorkhe
Hessar canals. for irrigation of crops. Sludge from these canals is also used for agricultural
purposes.
2.1.13 This and the next Section describe the geographic. ecological. social. and temporal context
of the project.
2.2    Project Objectives
2.2.1   The objectives of the project are:
- Provision of satisfactorv wastewater collection and treatment for about 2 million people
covering an area of about 16.500 hectares:
- improvement of public health and reduction of surface & groundwater pollution;
- Provision of treated wvastewater for irrigation of about 15.000 hectares in the Varamin
Plain:
- Development of the Tehran Sewerage Companv (TSC) into an autonomous entity to be
operated on a commercial basis; and
- Facilitation of the private sector participation in the
sector.
2.2.2   These objectives mnay be achieved by provision of: (a) a piped sewerage system to which
all properties will be connected; (b) sewage and sludge treatment facilities capable of
treating the resulting effluent and sludge to a standard appropriate for re-use in
agriculture: and (c) a sewage drainage system that removes the excess water from the
Tehran Plain and compensates Varamin Plain for its deficit.
2.2.3   The project will also have a major benefit of conservation of water resources in the Tehran
Region.
2.3    Sewerage and Sewage Transport
2.3.1   Wastewater will be conveyed to the treatment plants by means of an underground
network of pipes through tunnels and culverts. It is envisaged that all wastewater will
be conveyed by gravitv, without the need for pumping stations. This is because of the
topography of Tehran. as there is a gradient from north to south.
2.3.2   The City of Tehran is divided into 20 administrative regions (shown in Drawing
EAJ2), covering approximately 48,000 hectares. In Stage 1 covered by the Project,
Southern STP will treat sewage drained from an area of approximately 5,000 hectares
in the northern regions together with 1,500 hectares in central, and 10,000.hectares of
the southern regions. serving a population of about 2 million. These areas are shown
in Drawing EA/4. Priority is to be given to the "A" bed areas which suffer from poor

drainage and are prone to flooding. This should be completed bv 2001. In Stage 2,
additional 7.400 hectares of the south. east and north-eastern regions will be drained,
serving an additional population of approximately 2.8 million. These areas are shown
in Drawing EA13. This should be completed by 201 1.
2.3.3   The wastewater convevance system  to be constructed in Stage 1, the Project,
comprises of two roughly parallel trunk sewers running from north to south (known as
the Western and Eastern Main Sewers), interceptor sewers. branch and lateral sewers
and house connections (see Drawings EA/3. EA/4 and EA/5).
2.3.4  It is proposed that the eastern trunk sewer will be constructed as a tunnel. in order to
minimize disruption to traffic. Consideration has also been given to construction of
parts of the western trunk sewer by pipe jacking or tunneling methods for the same
reason.
2.3.5  Interceptor. branch and lateral sewers and house connections are likely to be
constructed bv open cut excavation. For the project to be successful. a sewer needs to
be laid in almost all streets of Tehran. For the Project areas. the total length of
interceptor. branch and lateral services is approximatelv 3.120 km.
2.3.6   The sizes of the sewers range from 3.000 mm down to 150 mm diameter.
2.3.7   Two sizes are required for the tunnel trunk sewer. 2,000 mm and 3,000 mm diameter.
It is envisaged that the tunnel will be constructed mainly using precast concrete
segments with a secondarv concrete lining. The culverts will be of in situ reinforced
concrete construction.
2.3.8  Every sewer will need to be provided with manholes for access and maintenance
purposes. A concrete pipe factory will manufacture the necessary precast reinforced
concrete manhole rings. The tunnel will also require access shafts and it is most likely
that precast reinforced concrete segments wvill be-used to construct these shafts.
2.3.9   The tunnel trunk sewer will be constructed at depths ranging from a minimum of about 9
meters up to a maximum of 35 meters.
2.3.10  All other sewers will be constructed at the minimum depth consistent with maintaining an
adequate gradient (to ensure that self-cleansing velocities are maintained) and avoidance
of other utilities. The depth of the sewers will be in the 2 m to 6 m range. House
connections will be at shallow depth, generally less than 2 m deep.
Western Main Selwer
2.3.11  The Westem Main Sewer route starts to the south of the junction of Vali-ye-Assr St. and
Miramad Boulevard. The sewer then drains southwards along Vali-ye-Assr St. for a
distance of approximately 11,500 m up to the junction with Shush St. At this point it,
continues south-eastwards across railway sidings for a distance of 600 m before reaching
Rajai St.. which it follows in a southern direction for 8.000 m before tuming eastwards,
crossing a railway line and meeting Qom Road. The route then turns south eastwards for a
distance of 2,000 m across open agricultural land before entering the Southern STP site.
4



2.3.12 The sewer for the most part will be constructed beneath existing main roads in the City,
and will pass through a mixture of residential. commercial and industrial areas. These main
roads carry verv heavv volumes of traffic. and the sewer will be constructed partiallv in
open cut and partially bv less disruptive methods. such as pipe jacking or tunneling. The
route of the proposed Tehran Metro follows Vali-ye-Assr St.. and eleven stations will be
located off this road. The route will involve a number of canal and railway crossings.
Eastern Main Sewer
2.3.13 The Eastern lain Sewer comprises 6.000 m of 2.000 mm diameter tunnel. 14.000 m of
3.000 mm diameter tunnel and 4.000 m of culvert. The Eastem Trunk Sewer route starts at
the junction of Dr. Ali-ve-Shariati St. and Pasdaran St.. then runs southwards for a distance
of 4.000 m along Dr. Ali-ve-Shariati St. before meeting Khajeh Nasir-E-Tusy, along which
it runs in a south-eastward direction for a distance of 1,000 m. At the junction with
Mazandarin and Damavand. the route tums south along Hefdah-E-Shahrivar for 6,300 m
before meetinz the junction with Besat Expressway. It then changes direction eastwards
along the Besat Expresswav for 600 m before tuming south along Shahrzad and Jaddeh
Sevvom for 5.500 m to the junction with Ebn-e-Babuyeh and the Varamin Road. At this
junction. the route heads eastwards along the Vararnin Road for 1.300 m before turning
south along the Gas Access Road. whereafter. another 2,100 m of sewer is needed to reach
the Southern Treatment Plant.
2.3.14 Owing to the problems with traffic congestion. especially near the Central City areas. the
sewer is to be mainly tunneled. The route will involve crossing under a number of canals
and the route of Tehran Metro. The final section of the Eastern Trunk Sewer. between the
bottom end of the tunnel and the Southern Treatment Plant will be constructed as a
reinforced concrete culvert by open cut methods.
Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar Canals
2.3.15 Polluted water from streams, jubes (surface water collection channels). and qanats
(originallv fresh water tuninels) presently flows from the north to the south of the City,
ultimatelv being discharged to the Firouzabad or Sorkhe Hessar Canals. Both canals pass
close to the site for the 'Southern treatment plant and it is proposed that. as an interim
measure. some of the canal water is treated in the treatment plant. This will not only
provide valuable plant operational experience. but will also improve the qualitv of the
canal water. Detailed plans for the transfer of canal water to the treatment plant are being
prepared.
2.3.16  The current flows are 402,000 m3/d in the Firouzabad canal and 562.000 m3/d in the
Sorkhe Hessar canal. so it will only be possible to treat a portion of the total flow. The
remainder will continue to flow into the Jaj-e-Rud as at present. The Firouzabad canal
passes through the westem part of the STP site. and will need to be culverted or diverted
prior to construction. The Sorkhe Hessar canal passes several hundred meters from the
site. Pumping stations would be required for the transfer of both flows to the works.
Detailed plans for these works are being prepared.

2.4          The Southern Sewage Treatment Plant
2.4.1  The Report on -'Sewage Treatment Alternatives' describes the design of the STP in
detail, comparing four alternative sewage treatment processes. The use of a
conventional surface aeration activated sludge system was recommended by this
report. with sludge treatment bv mesophilic anaerobic digestion.
Design Basis
2.4.2  Flows and loads for the Southern STP are shown in Table 2. 1. The biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD). loads are calculated on the basis of a per capita contribution
of 65 g BOD/d: 45 g from domestic sources and 20 g from industrial sources. The
suspended solids (SS) loads are calculated on the basis of a per capita contribution of
80g SS/d. The per capita flow is an average, taking infiltration and industrial flows
into account.

Effluent Quality
2.4.3  The effluent quality standards to be achieved are described in Table 2.2. The chemical
standards are based on the requirements of the EC directive on wastewater treatment3.
while the microbiological standards are based on the World Health Organization's
guidelines for the safe use of wastewater in agriculture4. The effluent will also comply
with the limits on potentially toxic element (PTE) quality of irrigation waters set by
the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (FAO). The
latter concern parameters which vary little with the type or level of sewage treatment
(sodium. boron etc.), and can onlv determine the suitabilitv of an effluent for
agricultural reuse. Hence. the influent will have to be carefullv monitored to avoid
exceeding these standards and take appropriate corrective actions when needed.
Quantities of Sludge for Treatment
2.4.4  The quantity of sludge produced by the activated sludge process has been estimated at
164 dry tons of cosettled sludge per day, or 60,000 dry tons per year. At 4% dry solids
content, this will represent a volume of 4,109 m3/d for disposal.

*Total nitrogen is taken as the sum of ammonia. nitrate and nitrite nitrogen
Sludge Treatment Standards
2.4.5   The sludge produced wvill be disposed on agricultural land and used as a fertilizer. The
treatment system will ensure that a microbiolo2ical standard of less than I intestinal
nematode egg per 100 grammes of drv solids (arithmetic mean) is achieved, in
accordance with the WHO guidelines4.
The STP Site
2.4.6   The Tehran Regional Water Board (TRWB) acquired the 110 ha site before 1991 for
the Southern STP (shown in Drawings EAJ3 and EA/I I and enclosed it within a
boundary wall. This site now is under TSC. The STP site is located to the south of
Shahr-e-Rey, just outside the 25-Year Plan area, between the Tehran to Varamin
Road and the Tehran to Garmsar Railway Line. The site is bounded by cultivated land
growing market produce to the north, west, north-east and south. To the south-east of
the site are several derelict brick works. The Firouzabad canal crosses the western
sector of the site flowing southwards. The northeastern corner of the site is crossed by
high voltage electricity transmission cables. Apart from a small number of farn
properties. the nearest substantial residential settlement is the southern suburbs of
Shahr-e-Rey, approximately I km to the northwest. The site is 2.5 km from the village
of Ghaleh Gabri. and 0.5 km from a petrochemical refinery. Access to the site is
achieved via Shahr-e-Rey to the northwest or from the northeast via the Gas Access
Road. The latter, which also. serves industrial activities. would be the most suitable
for construction and operation traffic. This route would minimize disruption of
residential areas.
Sewage Treatment
2.4.7   Drawing EA/12 shows the proposed layout of the STP in the Project (Stage 1), for
which detailed designs have been prepared.. The sewage treatment works consists of:
inlet works; primary sedimentation tanks: aeration tanks: secondary sedimentation
tanks: and disinfection using chlorine. The following designs apply to Project (Stage
1) flows only.
7



2.4.8   The conventional activated sludge process has been used successfully for large
populations worldwide and is described in detail in the Report "Review of Sewage
Treatment Altematives"'. The aeration tanks are designed on a plug flow basis with
anoxic zones for nitrification (conversion of ammonia to nitrate) and partial denitrification
(conversion of nitrate to gaseous nitrogen). This is in order to achieve the required effluent
qualitv (for BOD. suspended solids and total nitrogen) and ensure good settling of sludge
in the secondarv sedimentation tanks.
Inlet Works
2.4.9  These comprise of: an inlet pumping station with 7 screw lifi pumps: motor, switchgear
and control rooms: a transformer substation: 8 no. 10 mm bar screens, 6 no.  I m diameter
detritors: and 3 Parshall flumes for flow measurement. Flows will not exceed the capacity
of the treatment plant (400.000 m3/d) except possiblv under wet weather conditions.
Excess influent will overflow to the Firouzabad canal on these occasions and is expected
to be for less than 10 days in a year. The frequencv of the overflows will depend upon the
connected population and the intensitv of rainfall. However. these overflows are more
likelv to happen during the winter months when most of the rainfall occurs. The impact of
any overflow on the Firouzabad canal is expected to be small (less than 3 percent of the
time). since the sewage will be diluted with rainwater and the flows in the canal will be
increased due to surface water run-off. Should the frequencv of overflows become
unacceptable. then a simple solution would be construction of stormwater holding tanks at
the STP. A surface water drainage project is being implemented in Tehran which is
expected to alleviate such problems.
Disposal of Screenings and Grit
2.4.10   The quantities of screenings and grit from the inlet works are estimated to be less than 20
tons per day. Screenings will be washed and compressed on site, then transported in
watertight, covered vehicles to the existing sanitarv landfill site at Kahrizak. about 15 km
from the STP. Grit removed will be washed and stored to drv on the STP site. The dried
grit will also be transported to the nearest landfill site (about 15 km) for disposal.
Primarv Sedimentation
2.4.11 This comprises of 12 no: 47 m diameter reinforced concrete circular tanks with 3 m deep
sidewalls. Cosettled primary and surplus secondaryv sludge is to be removed from central
hoppers by auto desludging systems to the sludge treatment plant.
Aeration Tanks
2.4.12  These comprise of 30 reinforced concrete aeration tanks approximately 160 m long, 14 m
wide and 3.3 m deep. A transforner substation consisting of a switchgear building and
two transformer compounds will be provided for each aeration tank.
Secondary Sedimentation
2.4.13  This comprises of 24 no. 35 m diameter reinforced concrete circular tanks.
with 3.5 in deep sidewalls. Sludge is to be removed from central hoppers by
means of desludging pumps and recvcled to the aeration tanks or surplus sent to
8



the prirnarx' sedimentation tanks.
Effluent Disinfection
2.4.14 This svstem is designed to give a dosage rate of I to 10 mg/i chlorine into a peak flow ot
7 m3/s. Chlorine will be transported to STP in accordance with the Iranian Safety
Regulations for Transport of Hazardous Substances which are consistent with the
intemational guidelines. The proposed average dosage rate is 5 mg/il. Separate buildings
(with appropriate ventilation svstem) will be provided for storage of chlorine drums and
chlorination. A treated effluent pumping station is also required to provide chlorination
water and washwater. No chlorine contact tanks are planned. since a United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) mission proposed that a protected (fenced) effluent
transport canal will serve this purpose. producing an effluent complying with the faecal
coiiforim standard bv the time the effluent reaches the irrigation area. The same mission
indicated that the activated sludge process alone would produce an effluent complying
with the intestinal nematode egg standard. However. tertiary treatment has been provided
to ensure compliance with the WHO Guidelines.
Effliuent Transport to the Varamin Plain
2.4.15 Effluent transport from the Southern STP site will be via the already constructed Tehran
Canal which terminates just outside the eastern boundarv wall of the STP site. The canal is
34.782 m long, as shown on Drawing EAI.
2.4.16 The capacity of the canal is 8 m3/s, which is sufficient for the project flow (4.6 m3/s).
Sludge Treatment
2.4.17 The proposed arrangement of sludge treatment plant at the ST' is shown in Drawing
EA/12. The sludge treatment system consists of thickeners: pnmary anaerobic digesters;
secondary anaerobic digesters: drying; and storage.
Thickening
2.4.18 This comprises of 6 circular sludge thickening tanks each 21 m diameter and 5 m high,
Sludge is to be withdrawn continuously using three pumping stations to three sludge
holding tanks.
Primary Digestion
2.4.19 Three feed pumping stations will pump the thickened sludge to 12 no. circular primary
digestion tanks 15 m diameter and 23 m high. They are to be built entirely above ground.,
the tallest structures on the site. The design retention time is 16 days, and the operating
temperature 350C. Gas produced by the anaerobic digestion process is to be used in three:
heater houses 6.5 m high, to heat the sludge in the primary digesters and other heating
purposes. Excess gas will be automaticallv vented to the atmosphere through three waste
gas flare stacks.
9



Secondarv Digestion
2.4.20 Three pumping stations will pump sludge from the primary diaesters to circular secondary
digestion tanks (open tanks, 6 in number) 20 m diameter and 16 m high. These are also to
be built entirely above ground. The design retention time is 16 days. operated at ambient
temperature. A pumping station will return liquors from the thickeners and secondary
digesters to the STP inlet works.
Sludge Drving
2.4.21 The digested sludge will have a dr' solids content of 5%. Drying for two weeks is
anticipated to increase this to 55%. A total dryine bed area of 11 ha is proposed. divided
into some 130 beds. each 40 m by 20 m in plan.
Sludge Storage
2.4.22 The dried sludge is not expected to be pathogen free. The WHO guidelines indicate that
the intestinal nematode egg standard can be met through storage for one vear at ambient
temperatures. This is to be achieved in 14 concrete paved sludge storage bays 1.5 m deep
each covering 3,345 m2 and separated by dividing walls. The bays will be used on a batch
basis (one per month) to prevent stored sludge coming into contact with fresh
contaminated sludge cake. A total area of about 4.7 ha will be required.
Quantities of Treated Sludge for Disposal
2.4.23 The above processes will produce a pathogen-free sludge cake containing about 65% dry
solids. The expected volume of sludge for disposal is 49.236 cubic meters per year
(61,320 dry tonnes per year. or a weight including water of about 96.000 tons per year).
Power
2.4.24 The total installed power requirement for the entire project works (including sludge
treatment) is estimated at 14 MVA. Power consumption is estimated to be 68.063,000
kWh per annum. Power will be supplied from the power station near Shahr-e-Rey, 5 km
away. There will be 3 diesel standby generators giving a total output of 4.8 MW  to
provide sufficient power for operation of the essential plant and equipment (inlet works,
primary and secondary sedimentation and 50% of aeration tanks) and maintain levels of
treatment during any power failures.
Materials
2.4.25  The construction of sewerage network will require 120,000 tons of concrete pipes, 20,000
tons of low alkali cement and 4.000 tons of reinforcing steel per year during the project.
The total aggregate requirement (including that for concrete pipes) will be 170,000 tons
per year. Spoil will be disposed of at a municipality landfill. Stage I of the STP covered
by the project will require 352,579 m3 of excavation. 302,191 m3 of concrete and 29,261
tons of steel. A large proportion of the mechanical and engineering equipment required
will need to be imported from outside Iran.
10



Associated Jf'orks
2.4.26 Other requirements include access roads and administration. laboratory. workshops. store,
canteen. and gatehouse buildings.
Monitoring
2.4.27 A detailed monitoring program for the works has been prepared. It is intended that an
analytical laboratory will be built on the Southern STP site. to be staffed by one laboratory
manager one chemist. one microbiologist. and 5 technicians. Thev will monitor effluents
for pollution indicators (BOD5. COD. suspended solids. ammonia. nitrogen. phosphorus
and heavv metals), operational parameters of the activated sludge process. and the quality
of sludge generated.
2.5   Effluent Reuse in Agriculture
Area of Irrigation
2.5.1  The design and operation of the Southern STP envisages that most of the treated
sewape effluent will be utilized bv the existinz Varamin irrigation scheme (Drawings
EA/I7 and EA/18). Of the 70,000 ha identified as suitable for irrigation on the Plain, a
canalized area of 50.000 ha has already been constructed. although only 35,000 ha are
currently cropped. The treated sewage effluent will contribute to the irrigation supply
of this area, enabling the full 50,000 ha to be used for agriculture and thus becoming
one of the largest irrigation schemes in the world utilizing treated effluent.
Volume of Treated Effluent to be Used
2.5.2  The volume of available effluent will increase as sewer-connections are made. On
completion of project. it will reach 4.6 m3/s.
Irrigation Wlater Supplies.
2.5.3   There are plans to construct an additional dam on the Jaj-e-Rud to further regulate and
enhance river water supplies to the scheme. The quantities of future irrigation water
supply and the demand of the Varamin scheme have been estimated by TRWB, and
are shown in Table 2.3. These are based on a supply of effluent of 8 m3/s, equivalent
to 21 Mm3/month. The crop irrigation requirements have been calculated from the
area given over to each crop, and its monthly water demand. A 10% margin has also
been allowed for losses. These demand and supply figures have been developed to
show the amount that will be available for groundwater recharge. and the dilution of
the treated effluent that will occur in field practice in an average year. Treated effluent
supplied at this rate will contribute 36% of the water sources to the Varamin scheme.
Translated into simple crop production terms. this 36% represents 252 Mm3 per year,
which could produce 36,000 ha of wheat at projected levels of water use.

4Average dilution from  April to November = 1:2.6. All dilutioni figures will vary according to availability of river water.
s An annual total of 151,800,000 m3 will be used directly for field irrigation.
This balance assumes a constant treated effluent supply rate of 8 m3/s throughout the year.



2.5.4   When the 50.000 ha scheme is fullv implemented. the annual requirements of the
crops will be 583 Mm3. The water resources available, from  the Jaj-e-Rud river.
groundwater abstractions and treated effluent (assuming 8 m3/s supply) give a total of
699 Mm3. The excess of 115 Mm3 will be recharged to the aquifer. The balance
varies greatlv over the X ear. however. and groundwater sources are to be used over the
summer months (April to September) w hen the crop requirements increase
significantli. It is important to note that the river flow is highlv variable between
years and seasons. therefore. in a particularlv drv summer it may not be possible to
meet irrigation requirements at certain times. This reinforces the need to bring the
treated effluent supply on stream at the earliest possible opportunitv to provide some
insurance against poor river flows. The planned Jaj-e-Rud dam wvill. however, regulate
river flows to some extent. Because of the cumulative over-abstraction of the aquifer
that has occurred over the last 20 to 30 vears. it would not be a feasible option to
significantly increase groundwater abstraction.
Crop Pattern and Irrigation MVethods
2.5.5  The planned cropping programs and their irrigation water requirements for the full
50,000 ha development of the Varamin scheme are based on original FAO plans and
shown in Table 2.4. They include a small amount of double cropping, bringing the
annual area of crops up to 51,600 ha. The requirements have been increased by safety
margins of about 10% to provide the total monthly water requirements given in Table
2.3.
2.5.6  Since it is not practicable, given the existing irrigation scheme, to divert treated
effluent to particular crops, the treatment works have been designed to give treated
effluent of suitable quality for unrestricted agricultural application. Treated effluent
will always be used in a diluted form nevertheless, as it will be added to the other
water supplies in the primary network of canals. The estimated dilution factors are
included in Table 2.3. The least dilution will occur in October. with 2.1 volumes of
treated effluent to one volume of river water. but on avera2e the treated effluent will
be diluted with 1.8 volumes of river or groundwater to one volume of effluent.

2.5.7  It is assumed that irrigation Nvill continue to be carried out bv surface irrigation
methods. with minimal use of sprinkler or drip irrigation. Although the use of surface
methods has a lower efficiencv. heavv seasonal silt loads from the Jaj-e-Rud river
would cause blockage problems if sprinklers were widelv deploved.
2.6           Effluent Reuse bv Groundwvater Recharge
2.6.1  It is proposed that the recharge basins currently used for the recharge of Jaj-e Rud
river water near Abas Abad be used for the recharge of the surplus treated effluent.
This will be between October and Mav; the proposed quantities are shown in Table
2.3. The basins have a total area of 40 ha. and currently allow the recharge of 1.5 rn/s
(or 4 Mm3 per Month). The months of maximum  recharge will be December to
March. with 21 Mm3 per month. If these recharge basins cannot cope with the
increased volume then effluent will also be passed to the new group of basins to be
built between the Varamin diversion dam and Abas Abad. The volume of river water
recharged can be reduced as necessarv, increasing downstream flows.
2.7           Sludge Transport
2.7.1  Following storage for one vear on the Southern STP site -the sludge generated
(61.320 dry tons [96,000 wet tons] per year) will be transported to the Varamin Plain
for use as fertilizer. Transport lorries will be carrying an average of 8 dry tonnes of
sludge per trip. Thirteen such lorries will be required to make two round trips per day
on 300 working days per year. The sludge will only be removed from the STP site in a
dry condition. The lorries used for the transportation of sludge will be totally enclosed
and leak-proof.
2.7.2  The route will presumably be along the Tehran to Varamin road (see Drawing EA/I 8).
A round trip of 80 km has been assumed for the purposes of the costing exercise,
which implies an annual acreage of 624.000 km. and an annual diesel fuel
consumption of 1.248 m3.
2.8           Sludge Use in AgricultureL
2.8.1  The close proximitv of agricultural areas to Tehran. and the favourable location of the
treatment works to these areas. provides a useful outlet for the sludge generated.
There are three considerable advantages of using treated sludge in agriculture:
*  its ability, as a fertilizer, to provide most of the nutrients and micronutrients
needed for crops;
*  it broadly facilitates adjusting the ratio between the principal nutrients, nitrogenr
and phosphorus, and
* its high organic content, which can be of value as a soil conditioner in arid zone
soils.
15



2.8.2   When the Southern STP is operating at full capacity. approximatelv 96,000 wet tons
of treated sludge wvill be available per vear. The sludge will have been stored for one
year prior to use. in accordance with the WHO guidelines. These seek to ensure
pathogen removal and are designed to protect aaricultural workers and consumers,
particularly from intestinal parasites.
2.8.3  The sludge will be applied at a rate of 8 tons per hectare per vear. the lowest rate
which is considered practicable. This strategy would however maximize the area to
which the sludge will be applied. at 12.000 ha approximately one quarter of the
irrigation scheme. It is proposed that sludge is applied to a different quarter of the
land area each vear. so that a particular field would onlv receive sludge every 4 vears.
This will ensure that over a long period of time. the sludge should be applied
uniformlv to all the land to minimize the application per hectare of potentially toxic
elements.
2.8.4  The guidelines used in developing the sludge use strategy are the EC directives on the
use of sewage sludge in agriculture.
2.8.5  It is recognized that in the absence of legal restrictions. farmers would preferentially
wish to apply sludge to high value vegetable crops. This will therefore, be prohibited.
Sludge will only be applied to cotton and cereal crops. but other crops would be
rotated with these and hence, receive some advantage from the nutrient-rich soil. For
both crops, sludge application will be to the soil in advance of seed planting.
Sufficient time will be provided for this because there are long periods between the
harvesting of the previous crop and the planting of cereal and cotton crops.
Mouldboard ploughing will be used immediately after sludge application to bury most
of the applied sludge and minimize the potential wind blown problems. This
procedure should also virtually remove any human contact with sludge at the planting
and crop tending stages.
2.8.6  It is important that sludge is applied to cereals and cotton rather than higher value
crops such as vegetables and salads. Twvo problems which mav arise in the latter case:
it would be difficult to ensure the required 10 month delav between sludge application
and harvesting; the larger amounts of sludge which would have to be applied to these
high value crops may cause some heavy metal concentrations to exceed safe limits but
sufficient mitigatory measures are going to be in place (including the control of heavy
metals in the influent to STP) to avoid any potential problems.
2.9          Preconstruction Activities
2.9.1  In addition to the design which is an obvious pre-requisite of any major construction
project. there are number of pre-construction activities to be undertaken.
2.9.2  For the wastewater conveyance system. it is proposed that all sewers be constructed
wherever possible in roads or public open spaces.
16



Relocation of People and Indigenoius People
2.9.3   No relocation of people will be necessarv for the construction activities in the project.
There are no indigaenous people in the project area.
Planning and Liaison
2.9.4   The construction of first time sewerage in a major citv such as Tehran. involving,,
sewer laving in virtually everv street in the City, will require that construction
activities are carefully planned to minimize disruption and that good liaison is
estabiished and maintained with other concerned authorities.
2.9.5   The planning and liaison process should commence during the design of the project.
At this stage, consultations with the municipalitv are going on to ensure that the
chosen sewer routes are acceptable. with the traffic police to ensure that the sewer
routes minimize disruption to the flow of traffic. and with the various utility
companies to minimize conflict with existing and proposed water. electricity,
telephone. and gas services. In addition. the sewers will cross existing jubes, surface
water streams. canals and qanats. all of which must be kept operational during
construction. Possible conflicts with the Metro project are being investigated and
action taken as appropriate to minimize such conflicts.
Public Relalions and Public Participation
2.9.6   Although careful planning and liaison as described above should help minimize
disruption to the general public. it is inevitable with such an extensive project that the
public will suffer some disruption from time to time. This may be as a result cf
increased traffic congestion in the City as a whole or from construction activities in
the local neighborhood. However, care will be taken to minimize these to acceptable
levels.
2.9.7   Raising public awareness of the benefits of the project and keeping the public
informed of construction activities will assist in the smooth running of the project.
Public participation meetings have been held in the past and one was held in April
1999. Issues raised were noted and action will be taken to address these. The main
issues are: (a) the project is urgently needed . (b) there should be effective cooperation
amongst various agencies involved and (c) good quality work should be performed.
2.10   Construction Activities
2.10.1 Construction of the project is to be carried out under a number of construction
contracts ending in 2005.
2.10.2 Construction of the administration buildings on the Southern Treatment Plant (STP) is
already completed.
17



Construction Contracts
2.10.3 Four international construction contracts are currently proposed for the project:
*  Eastem trunk- sewer tunnel - southern part ( 14 km of 3 m diameter tunnel)
* Eastern trunk sewer tunnel - northern part (6 km of 2 m diameter tunnei)
* Western trunk sewer
*  Southern Treatment Plant-equipment and civil engineering works
2.10.4 The remaining construction contracts for the project (Stage 1) works are to be carried
out bv local contractors. These are as follows:
* Eastern trunk sewer - culvert
* Interceptor sewers - northern areas
 Interceptor sewers - southern areas
* Five contracts for lateral and branch sewers
* House connections
*  Southern Treatment Plant-auxiliarv buildinfls
Costs
2.10.5 The project is expected to cost $337 million and may require the import of mechanical
and electrical equipment.

3.0          DESCRIPTION OF THE BASELINE ENVIRONMENT
3.1          Geographical Environment
Topographv
3.1.1  Tehran is located at the foot of the Alborz Mountains. at approximately l.300m above
sea level. The city occupies the northern part of the alluvial Tehran Plain, sloping
from the mountains to the flat featureless Great Salt Desert. To the south and west of
the urban area lies a belt of fertile land forming the southern part of the Tehran Plain
and the Varamin Plain.
3.1.2  The urban area is bounded by mountains to the north and east. with the ground
sloping southward. falling 800 m over the 25 km from the northern suburbs to
Shahr-e-Rev in the south. The gradient eases from 1:20 in the north to 1:200 at the
southern fringe of the city.
3.1.3  The southern part of the Tehran Plain is essentially flat and is crossed by the Kan
River. The Varamin Plain. to the east. slopes gently from 1.100 m to 850m, with much
of it forming the alluvial fan of the Jaj-e-Rud River.
Settlement Pattern
3.1.4  Tehran City, for two hundred years the capital of Iran, presently occupies an area
exceeding 700 km'. This incorporates a number of surrounding centers including
Shemiran in the north and Shahr-e-Ray in the south. The Municipality, controlled by a
mayor and council, is divided into 20 Regions. each with its own administrative staff.
3.1.5  The northern zone (Regions 1-5). generallv defined as the area north of Abbasabad
Avenue. is mostly a high class residential area. with population densities below 100
people/ha and a pleasant suburban character.
3.1.6  The central zone (Regions 6, 7. 8, 11, 12. 13 and 14) contains a mixture of modern
high-rise business development and residential areas with 3 and 4 story apartment
blocks. The population density ranges from 100 to 300 people/ha.
3.1.7  The old commercial centers and crowded bazaar area comprise the southern zone of
the city (Regions 9, 10. 16-19). The population is dense, on average 500 people/ha,
and in some areas, 1,000 people/ha.
3.1.8  The town of Shahr-e-Ray (Region 20), adjoining the southern fringe of the Tehran
Municipality, consists of 8 rural districts and 217 villages, with a population of,
400,000 population in the city.
3.1.9   Varamin town is the principal population center of the Varamin Plain, with three
sectors divided into 8 rural districts and 221 villages. The population of 560,000 is
approximately equally split bet-ween urban and rural areas.
19



3.1.10 The estimated land use pattern for the Tehran area is:
Forested                                   11%
Meadows and Pastures                       27%
Agricultural (under permanent cultivation)  9%
Urban                                      45%
Other (desert. swamp. etc.)                 8%
Forested areas are generallv in the north. east and xvest. w*hile pastures and
agricultural areas are to the immediate south and east of the city.
Comrmunications Nertvork
3.1.1 1 In Tehran Citv, the main road system in the central and southern areas is a rectangular
grid svstem of broad tree-lined avenues, with narrow streets and alleys in each block.
A series of parallel north-south roads links the northern suburbs to the center, and a
major freewav connects the western district of Karaj. In addition to the bus system,
there is a heavv reiiance on taxis. A large increase in the ownership of private cars
has led to a serious problem of congestion.
3.1.12 Four major rail routes radiate from the Central Rai lwav Station to the south of the city
center in Region 16. The three principal lines are: the Tehran-Ghazvin line westward,
skirting the edge of the Alborz mountains; the Tehran-Saveh line south-west; and the
line to Garmsar via Varamin, running south-east through the center of the Varamin
Plain. A transportation plan in the early 1970s proposed an underground Metro
system for the city to ease traffic congestion. Parts of this are presently under
construction, and shown on drawing EA/5 and Tehran-Karaj line. which travels over
land. started operation in Feb. 1999.
3.1.13  Four main hip,hwavs traverse the Tehran and Varamin Plains. Saveh Road runs
south-west from Ghale Morghi Airport and through Nezarnabad. with the Saveh
railwav line broadly parallel. Another road cuts southwNard across the Tehran Plain
from Shahr-e-Rev town towards Qom Road and rail links run south-east from
Shahr-e-Rey to Varamin town and Pishva. then take differing routes on to Garmsar.
3.1 .14  Most of the industrv in Tehran is currently located in the center and south of the city
(Regions 9. 16, 18. 19 & 20), with some also in the eastern part of Region 4. Much is
on unsuitable sites close to residential areas. Having recognized this problem, the
government has begun a phased program of relocation of the most polluting industries
to specially designated zones south of the city. About 6.500 hectares of land has been
allocated to these industries at six sites and more than 2,000 of the most polluting
industries out of 15,000 workshops and factories have already left the city by 1999.
20



3.2           Social and Economic Environment
Population?
3.2.1  In the late 18th century. Tehran was a small trading center with a population of
20.000. but now it plavs a dominating role in the economic. social and political life of
[ran. It is the seat of government the commercial capital. The 1986 census recorded a
population of 8.7 million for Tehran Province. with 6 million in the citv itself.
3.2.2  Tehran currentlv has a high rate of population growth. The city is growing fastest in
the southern Regions where there are fewer physical barriers to development. The
g rowth of the southem  suburbs which include Shahr-e-Rey and Eshghabad was
around 7 to 8% per year. The government took actions to ease the problem of
population growth. The Ministry of Health has allocated one billion Rials annually for
birth control and has targeted population growth to fall to 2.9 % bv 1994. The latest
census (1996) recorded a population of 11 million for Tehran province. with 6.7
million in the citv itself. The growth rate for province was recorded at 4.7 percent but
for the city had dropped to 0.9 percent during the 1986-96 period. Current population
is estimated at about 7 million (more than 8 million in dav time).
3.2.3  The number of refugees in the country is falling, with more than one million having
returned to Iraq, leaving 150,000 (mainiy Kurds) remaining. There are still 3 million
Afghan refugees. although the number of refugees living in the project area is
unknown.
3.2.4  The population density varies from 100 to 1000 people/ha. with higher numbers in the
older and poorer districts of the south. The total population and popuiation density of
each Region of Tehran is shown in drawing EA/2.
3.2.5  The number of households in Greater Tehran. according to the 1986 census, is 1.66
million with an average of 3.98 persons per household and 1.1 households per
dwelling unit (house or flat). The number of people in a household has increased
slightly since the 1986 census, but the number of households per dwelling unit has
decreased.
3.2.6  Before the implementation of a piped water network. the citv developed southward in
response to the flow of water along the jubes and qanats. With a piped water supply
and accelerated population growth, the citv expanded in all directions. Poor quality
high-density housing was developed in the south and modem multi-storv apartment
blocks were built in the north. The public services have not, however, kept pace with
the population and current water sewage and power services are inadequate.
3.2.7  The town of Shahr-e-Rey lies south of Tehran citv (Region No.20), with a population
of 400,000 in urban area. The area consists of 8 rural districts and 217 villages, of
which only 199 are inhabited. The distribution of population between age groups is:
21



Under 15  vears      49.5%
15 to 64 vears       48.7%
65 years and older   1.8%
A verv high proportion of the population of Shahr-e-Rev is served by piped water
(98.1 %). and 59% of houses have a bath.
3.2.8  Varamin is a satellite town of Tehran to the southeast of the city. It is divided into
three sectors of eight rural districts. and has a population of 560.000 (1996). 51.3% of
the population live in the 221 inhabited villages. and 48.7% in the urban areas. The
average densitv of population is 288 people/km2. and their age distribution is:
Under 15 vears       45.5%
15 to 64 vears      52.1%
65 years and older   2.4%
In Varamin Town. 97.4% of the population receive piped water and 55% of homes
have their own bath.
3.2.9  There are no villages located within one km of proposed STP site.
3.2.10 There are some small farming communities located south of the proposed STP site, the
nearest of which is Quch Hessar more than one km away from the site, the residence
of which are mainly seasonal farm workers.
3.2.11  Infortnation obtained from the Economic Intelligence unit (EIU) quarterly reports on
Iran shows relatively high rates of unemployment and low rates of female
participation. The large numbers of refugees in the countrv may influence the
following figures.
Population of Iran          (1991)               57.050,000
Economically Active Population                   12.820.291
Participation Rate          (all 15-64)              51.3%
Participation Rate          (Females)                10.2%
Unemployment rate                                    14.2%
3.2.12 The labor force statistics (from 1986 EIU figures) show a relativelv high proportion in
trade and construction (12%). There has been a significant growth in manufacturing
employment at the expense of agriculture.
3.2.13 Twenty-five per cent of the population, however, are employed in agriculture. Farm
labour in the region is mostly performed by Afghan immigrants. Workers and owners
do not live on farms. but in the villages and towns.
Economic Background
3.2.14 At present, industrv is the major contributor to growth, and industrial exports are
growing. The outlook for agriculture is good. but agriculture production is more
affected by availability of water than any other factor. The oil sector is the largest
22



contributor for hard currencv, and the capacint to import is largely determined by the
perforrnance of this sector.
3.2.15  There are no indigenous people within the project study area.
3.3           Cultural Environment
3.3.1  Tehran was created capital of Iran in 1787. At the start of this century. the whole city
(the old bazaar area) was surrounded bv green spaces and all the districts were called
gardens or parks. Tehran's development to a modern citv began in the 1920s, but most
of its expansion has occurred since the 1960s. Tehran's rapid industrialisation. good
infrastructure and public services, better employment opportunities. and place as the
focus of the country s social. cultural and political activities. have all contributed to
the burgeoning growth of the city. This has been exacerbated by migration into the
area as a result of wars and natural disasters. The population and industrial growth has
lead to a number of environmental problems.
3.3.2   Thle ancient citv of Ray (now Shahr-e-Rav). to the south of the present conurbation of
Tehran. is the historical focus of the area. Rav citv was. in the early years of Islam,
the most important Muslim city after Baghdad. Now, however, only the ruins of
buildings and remains of tombs are left. There are several important forts and palaces
sites near to areas potentially affected by the project. but none of these structures
would be directly affected by the project.
3.3.3   A number of important and historic religious buildings are located adjacent to the
routes of the twvo trunk sewers. These are:
a      A mosque at the junction of Val-ye-Assr Street and Dr. Beheshti Street,
approximately 25 m from the main sewer.
*      A mosque on Val-ye-Assr Street opposite Shahid Assadi Manesh Street,
approximately 60 m from the main sewer.
A  mosque near the junction  of Shahid  Rajai Street and Bisdto-Do
Metri-ve-Charmsazi Street, approximately 100 m from the main sewer.
*      A mausoleum  (Imamzadeh) at the junction of Shahid Rajai Street and
Aramgah Boulevard, approximately 75 m from the main sewer.
In addition. there are likely to be a number of historical buildings adjacent to the routes
of the interceptor and connecting sewers. Since these will affect most of the city,
individual sites have not been identified.
3.3.4   The Cultural Heritage Organization has been contacted and is familiar with the
project. including the sewer routes and the STP site. The locations of all known
arehaeological sites have been established. and there will be continuing liaison with
the Cultural Heritage Organization as the Tehran Sewerage Project proceeds.

3.4          Surface Water and Wasiewater
Rivers and Catchments
3.4.1   No major perennial rivers flow through the Greater Tehran area. The Jaj-e-
Rud rises in the Alborz Mountains north of Tehran and flows east of the city, down to
the Varamin Plain. The flow. which averages 310 Mm3/vr (million cubic meters per
annum) at this point. is intersected by the Latian Dam which diverts approximately 80
Mm3/vr to Tehran as potable water supplv.
3.4.2  Downstream of the dam. the Jaj-e-Rud is joined by just one significant tributary, the
Damavand Rud. contributing around 20% of the total flow at this point. Where the
river debouches on to the Varamin Plain. the naturai alluvial fan of the river has been
utilized as an irrigation scheme. An extensive network of canals was constructed in the
1980s and is currentlv used to irrigate an area of 35.000 ha.
3.4.3  At the head of the irrigation area. the Varamin Diversion Dam diverts the flow of
Jaj-e-Rud to a network of lined canals. From these. water is conveved to each field by
an extensive svstem of unlined channels. The Tehran canal from the proposed
Southern STP Site at Shahr-e-Rev joins the main irrigation canal approximately 800
m south of the diversion dam.
3.4.4  A residual flow of between 11 and 110 Mm/yr. leaves the irrigation area and rejoins
the original course of the Jaj-e-Rud which. flowing south. joins the Karaj River and
the Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals approximatelv 60 km south of Tehran. The
Karaj River is intercepted by the Amir Kabir Dam in the mountains to the north-west
of Tehran. diverting approximately 184 Mm3/vr to the city's water supply. The Karaj
descends to the Tehran Plain and skirts the edge of the agricultural area. The water
from the Karaj is used to irrigate parts of the Tehran Plain.
3.4.5  In addition to these two rivers. Karaj and Jaj-e-Rud. there are several ephemeral and a
few perennial rivers which debauch on to the alluvial plain. About 70% of their flows
occur during the four months March-June, with most of their discharges; going to
recharge the underlying aquifer. The largest of these rivers is the Kan. passing 10 kmn
east of central Tehran, with an average flow of 72 Mm3/yr. The Kan crosses the
agricultural part of Tehran Plain and joins the Jaj-e-Rud west of Varamin.
3.4.6  To fulfil increasing demand for potable water in Tehran and hydro-electric power,
sufface water from other catchments is being exploited. The Lar Dam completed in
1980, intercepts the River Lar. which discharges northwards to the Caspian Sea. Over
150 Mm3/yr is diverted to the Latian reservoir, on the Jaj-e-Rud, and thence to Tehran
and the Varamin Plain.
3.4.7  Several watercourses flow from the Alborz mountains into the Greater Tehran area.
These art shown in Drawing EA17. Several are prevented from entering Tehran by the
Western Diversion canal. The remainder drain into the Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar
canals. which emerge from the south of the city. eventuallv to join the Jaj-e-Rud. The
average canal flows leaving the City from 1985 to 1987 were 433.000m3/d in the
Firouzabad at Javanmard Ghasseb and 413.000 m3/d in the Sorkhe Hessar at
24



Pol-Siman. Current estimates of the canal flows am 402.000 m3/d in the Firouzabad
and 562.000 m3/d in the Sorkhe Hessar. As-the urban area has expanded northwards,
sections of these canals have been channeled or enclosed. particularlv in the more
affluent residential suburbs.
Waler Supplv
3.4.8   Until the 1930s, Tehran's water supply was obtained exclusively from the network of
qanats. the traditional Iranian method of clean water supply for 2.000 vears. They are
g-entlv sloping tunnels which tap the underlying aquifer and bring wvater to surface
qanats still exist. but now function as surface water drains and for irrig-ating the trees
lininQ the streets. eventuallv discharging to sewers or canals.
3.4.9  In 1933. the Karaj Canal was built, diverting water 46 km from the Karaj River, to
meet the city's increasing demand. At this time, drinking water was mostly drawn
from wells or purchased from water carts. Due to the increasing water demand and
awareness of public health risks. however. in 1949 a public water supply authority
was formed. which commissioned a piped supplv system and water treatment works.
3.4.10 Since construction of the piped supply network in the late 1950s. the population of the
citv of Tehran has more than quadrupled to over 6 million. Construction of the Amir
Kabir Dam on the Karaj River and the Latian Dam on the Jaj-e-Rud provided assured
supplies of 280 Mm3/yr and 180 Mm3/yr respectively. Groundwater abstraction was
also increased. with the sinking of boreholes at Kan. To the west of Tehran, two
water treatment works were built. The construction of the Lar Dam, 50 km north-east
of the city, provided an additional resource exceeding 100 Mm'/yr.
3.4.11  Presently, the piped network covers an area of around 500 km  in Tehran. In other
areas. the population is served by stand pipes, a declining number of private water
companies and bv private wells. The current annual water consumption is
approaching 875 Mm3/yr. In 1997, this was derived from the following sources:
Karaj River (Amir Kabir Dam)               32%
Jaj-e-Rud River (Latian Dam)               20%
Lar River (Lar Dam)                        12%
Groundwater sources                        36%
3.4.12 Current water consumption per capita is 198 l/d, made up of 142 I/d domestic
consumption, 44 I/d public & governmental consumption, and 12 I/d commercial &:
industrial consumption. This is not expected to change, however the total demand
will increase with population growth.  Because of problems of pollution of
groundwater from existing sewage disposal practices (see Section 3.5), the future use
of water from this source is likely to be restricted. The TRWB estimates that potable
water resources will be insufficient to meet demand bevond 2000.
3.4.13 The quality of the various sources of Tehran's water supply is shown in Table 3.1.
Waters from the Karaj and Jaj-e-Rud rivers are currently purified at four water
treatment plants. whose capacities are also shown. The water supplied does not
exceed WHO or EC limits.
25



3.4.14 There are two competing water demands on the Jaj-e-Rud: domestic water
consumption via the Latian Dam: and irrigation of the Varamin Plain. The mean
qualitv of the river used for irrigation from 1968 to 1974 was: pH 7.8; 355 mg/I total
dissolved solids: sodium adsorption ratio of 1 .2. indicating a good suitability for
irrigation,
3.4.15 Groundwater is abstracted outside Tehran for potable use within the city and the only
treatment it receives is chlorination. The sources do not exceed the WHO or EC limits
shown in Table 3.1. Groundwater from within the citv is not currentlv abstracted for
potable use since it is more polluted (as shown in Section 3.5) but is supplied
untreated to the 560 public baths in Tehran. The maximum water consumption occurs
from June to mid-August. and is around 1.4 times the annual average. The peak
demand is accommodated by increased pumping of groundwater and diversion of
water from the Lar Dam. The TRWB has plans to drill additional abstraction wells
near Tehran and. due to problems of deteriorating groundwater quality, is considering
on-site purification of the water from some of these sources.
Sewage Disposal
3.4.16 Tehran is one of the larger cities in the world without a comprehensive piped
sewerage system. Domestic and industrial wastewater is generally discharged to
sewage wells. Various local STPs treat a total of 160,000 m3/d of sewage from about
800,000 people, draining 5,800 ha of the city. The majority uses the extended aeration
process. Most of the STPs discharge effluents into the Sorkhe Hessar and Firouzabad
canals.
3.4.17 The majority of the sewage of Tehran is disposed of to sewage wells, of which it is
estimated that there are already over 3 million under Tehran. These are typically 15 to
20 m deep with a volume of 60 m3, although the size, number and depth of wells is
,governed by the permeability of the ground and the quantity of sewage to be disposed.
The sewage wells are usually built under buildings or adjoining land. The liquid
portion of the sewage soaks away or evaporates, wvhile the solid portion accumulates
and degrades in the well. Eventually the well becomes clogged. at which time it is
emptied, or filled in and a new well is dug. In older properties, wells are usually
located under the house, but in new developments. they are situated in gardens. Small
dwellings may have a single well, but most houses have two or even three, with foul
wastes and washwater being discharged to separate wells.
3.4.18 The wells have a limited life of between 10 and 30 years, and this method of sewage
disposal is by no means a low cost option. The average cost of digging a new sewage
well is 8.000,000 Rials and renovation of old ones costs 6,000,000 Rials.
3.4.19 Where large quantities of wastewater are produced, such as certain hotels and
multi-story buildings, some form of treatment using package treatment plants is
provided before discharge to sewage wells. This reduces the number of wells which
would otherwise be needed.

3.4.20  Several problems are encountered with the sewage well system. In the south. where
ground conditions are often unsuitable due to the high proportion of fine materials in
the soil. wells do not function adequatelv. Washwater and some foul water is
discharged to jubes and other surface waters. although this practice has been officially
forbidden. In areas of the north where the geology has a high silt and clav content and
hence. low permeabilitv ("A" beds), the water table is often within 2 m of ground
level. Here sewage wells fill up rapidly and require emptying every 3 to 6 months.
Due to the costs involved. they are frequentiv allowed to overflow into the jubes. In
one area. fecal matter is discharged directly to a surface water canal. The poilution of
jubes affects the whole citv area and is exacerbated by their frequent use as public
toilets. The discharge of sewage to the ground has adverse effects on the aquifer in
terms of rising levels and contamination.
3.4.21  Since most sewage well failures occur from the blocking of pores with fine material,
pumping out the wells serves little purpose. except as a temporarv expedient. With the
total area of sewage well bases exceeding 50 km2. there is insufficient space in some
areas to dig new wells. This situation is likely to become more critical in the future.
Industrial Wastewater Disposal
3.4.22  In addition to domestic wastewater, there is a wide variety of industries in the Tehran
area generating effluents of different types. In co-ordination with the city's land use
zoning plan, there is an ongoing program to relocate the most polluting industries
south of the city. The-industries. have been classified into nine groups according to
the types of effluent produced, and these are presented below in Table 3.2.
Table 3.2 Classification of Industries in Iran Based on the Nature of Effluents
Group         Types of fndustry
I             Leather tanneries, animal carcass processing, soap
making
2             Wool washing, textile dying, paper recycling
3             Metallurgical industries
4             Stone cutting and processing
5             Glass making
6             Ceramic and tile making industries
7             Brick making industries
8             Metal plating industries
9             Car breakers
The priority for relocation of these industries is firstly group I then 8. 3, 4, 5, 9, 6, 7
and lastly 2.
3.4.23  Though Tehran is a large city with a sizeable industrial sector. there is little
informnation available on the quantity and nature of industrial wastewaters produced.
3,345 industrial premises in Tehran have been surveyed as part of the 25-Year Plan,
but only 450 questionnaires were returned. From this sample it was extrapolated that
the southern region of Tehran produces 36,000 m3/d of industrial wastewater. The
28



estimates of the organic load from industrial sources originates in Volume 2 of the
1986 Rav-Ab report "Updated Studies of the First Stage of the Tehran Sewerage
Project".
3.4.24 The Firouzabad canal is known to receive dischargzes from 60 public baths: several
hospitals: leather workshops: 12 carpet laundries: a vegetable oil refinery; and a large
number of car repair shops. The Sorkhe Hessar canal is known to receive discharges
from: 6 leather workshops; 25 carpet laundries; a vegetable oil refinery; 9
stonemasons: 2 cement factories: one glycerine. margarine and cotton refinery; a large
number of plastics manufacturers: and 4 large military bases. A large number of these
industries are planned to be relocated bv 2002.
3.4.25  Large quantities of arsenic were being used in Tehran as a depilatory substance in
tanneries and public baths for hair removal. But recentlv with tanneries being
relocated outside of Tehran City limits and public sanitation practices changing as
result of which almost no arsenic is being used in Tehran's public baths. Arsenic is
not present in Tehran's sewave at significant levels. It should also be noted that with
more houses having their own private baths. the public baths are going out of
operation in increasing numbers.
3.4.26 There are 84 hospitals in Tehran, only a few of which currently have sewage
treatment or effluent disinfection. Most discharge untreated sewage to surface waters
or sewage wells. A survey is currently being undertaken of discharges from hospitals.
It is intended that pretreatment of discharges will be provided where necessary to
meet the Iranian Department of Environment Standards for discharge to sewers.
These standards are currently under development.
Surface Water Drainage
3.4.27 In the urban areas of.Tehran. the network of jubes (traditional drains) forms the basis
of the surface water drainage system. Jubes are nornally of rectangular cross-section
and sited at the edges of streets or in the middle of narrow allewvays. Construction
methods vary, but most are now formed from pre-cast concrete sections or in-situ
concrete. The jubes are usually relatively free from obstructions. but may be restricted
where crossed by roads or private accesses. Most are uncovered, except at road
crossings. The jubes were originally designed for the supply of clean water to much of
the city, and to irrigate trees. Their sizes and gradients. therefore. are not always
appropriate for the drainage of surface water.
3.4.28 The main jubes convey their flow into the Firouzabad Canal, to the southwest of the
city centre, and the Municipal Tunnel, which passes underneath central Tehran. The
latter joins the Sorkhe Hessar I km north of Shahr-e-Rey. The two canals join the
Jaj-e-Rud river to the south of Tehran.
3.4.29 The Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals are at present grossly polluted. Both the
water and the sludge, which lines the banks. are black and foul smelling. Domestic
and industrial solid wastes are frequently disposed of into the canals. The canal waters
are often used to irrigate crops to the south on the Tehran plain.
29



3.4.30 No data are available on the quality of the canal sludges used in agriculture but the
pilot plant investigation of the treatabilitv of waters from the canals in 1989 and 1990
produced primarv sludges from canal waters which had been allowed to settle for two
hours. The average heavv metal content of these sludges is reproduced in Table 3.3
and compared to limits for sewage sludges to be used in agriculture. The limit for
cadmium is considerablv exceeded. This data is representative of the settled sludges
currently being used but not necessarilv biologicallv produced sludges which may
originate from a STP.
3.4.31  In 1991. the qualitv of waters in the Sorkhe Hossar canal and the Firouzabad canal
was surveved (15.000 chemical and 2.000 microscopic analyses). The results are
presented in Table 3.4 in the form of mean and maximum figures. The data show that
the principal water qualitv problem in Sorkhe Hesrar and Firouzabad canals is gross
organic pollution. BODs levels exceeding 25 mg/I are generally regarded as indicative
of sewvage pollution and this threshold was exceeded in every sample. The waters
appear to contain a large amount of raw sewage. Mean concentrations of chromium
and iron exceed safe limits for crop irrigation.
3.4.32  Microbiological parameters were not surveyed in the above study but the results of a
more recent study of a study of jube (open surface water drain) quality along
Vali-ve-Assr Street carried out between November 1991 and March 1992 reveal a
similar pattern with counts of feacal coliforrns between 2 x 102 and 1.6 x 106
FC/100ml. Ascaris and other helminths were also isolated (up to 10 eggs per litre).
This is again indicative of strong faecal pollution and the public health hazard posed.
Groundwater Recharge of Surface Waters
3.4.33 Some of the water from the Jaj-e-Rud is returned to groundwater under the Varamin
Plain during periods of low irrigation water demand. The recharge basins (shown on
Drawing EA/18 are all of earth construction and 1.5 to 2 m deep. Concrete siphons
are used to prevent overspill of banks and allow the water to pass from one basin to
the next.
3.4.34 The first oroup of basins was built near Abas Abad (point A on Drawings EA/I,
EA/IS and EA/I 8) in 1989, with a total area of about 40 ha. These allow the recharge
of about 1.5 m3/s. The second group of basins was built near the Varamin diversion
dam in 1990. Twelve recharge ponds. each covering about 10 ha allow the recharge of
about 8 m3/s.
Recreational Waters
3.4.35 Several water bodies within the Tehran area have recreational use. These are all
located within parks and none are presently polluted by canal or jube water. In
addition. there are a series of fish ponds at Eshghabad covering an area of 300 ha, and
up to 4 m in depth. These naturally fill with the surrounding groundwater once they
are dug, but are not currently experiencing pollution problems.

3.5           Hydrogeology
Geologv
3.5.1  The Tehran Plain and the Varamin Plain consist of two large alluvial plains. These
plains are formned by material which has been deposited bv rivers flowing from the
Alborz Mountains in the north. The Alborz range consists of a chain of mountains that
trend from east to west. to the south of the Caspian Sea. They are composed of
various sedimentarv and igneous rocks. and include significant areas of limestone.
They are geologicallv "young" in age, having been forned by earth movements of
Alpine age. They rise to about 4.000 m in height north of Tehran. and because they
are relatively new. are subject to rapid erosion. Soils are thin on the mountains so that
rates of run off following rainstorms are verv high. The resulting floods have been
primarily responsible for transporting the weathered rock. and depositing the
sediments on the plains where the gradients decrease.
3.5.2  There is another. much lower. range of hills to the east of Tehran. the Sepayeh, or
Anti-Alborz. wvhich also trend roughlv from east to west. They are anticlinal in
structure. with the axis of the anticline dipping westwards. Their height decreases,
until in the area of central and eastern Tehran.  They are covered by alluvial
sediments. The deposits are mainly Mesozic Calcareous formations but also include
sedimentary rocks from Devonian to lower Tertiary age. Some volcanic rocks are
included in the succession. The hills to the east of the Varamin Plain are similar to
those of the Sepayeh. both structurally and lithologically. The low hills in the
Eshghabad area are formed from strata of the Lower Red Formation of the Miocene.
The strata consists of basic intrusive rocks - basalts. marls, clays, siltstones, and
intercalated sandstones. These rocks should also be regarded as impermeable.
The Alluvium
3.5.3  "Alluvium" is the name that has been given to the varietv of deposits that form the
Tehran and Varamin Plains. They consist of boulders. cables. gravels. sand silts and
clays, all of which have been transported and deposited bv river action. as a result of
weathering of the adjacent mountains. The gradients of the rivers carrying these
materials have been greater in the mountains and decrease as the rivers reach the
plains. Generally, therefore, the coarser materials are found nearer the mountains. and
the finer materials. silts; and clays, are found out on the plains. However, near the
river channels. even some distance out onto the plains. coarser deposits can be found
as a result of flood flows.
3.5.4  Both the Tehran and Varamin plains are composed of this alluvial material, and their
surfaces slope southwards with a decreasing gradient with distance from the
mountains. Thick Bahada fans, increased by the rivers, are found as marginal features
fringing the piedmont. The alluvium of the Tehran Plain has been studied in some
detail. because of its importance for groundwater resources. The oldest division is that
of the "A" beds. These are partly cemented conglomerates. having a high silt and clay
content. and therefore tend to have a relativelv low permeability. They are of
Plio-Pleistocene age, and have been folded into a series of east to wvest trending
anticlines and synclines. Some of the anticlinal folds, which have very steep or near
33



vertical limbs. are now represented topographicallv by a series of high-ground ridges
in the northern part of the citv. A group of silty mudstones outcrops in the cave of two
of the anticlines. and is exposed near the base of the "A" beds near the latian ridge.
Thev are believed to attain a maximum thickness of about 500 m.
3.5.5  The "B" beds unconformablv overly the "A" beds. and form a heterogeneous generally
flativing sheeting of alluvial sediments outcropping as eroded Bahada fans fringing
the mountain margin and also the "A" bed ridges. The dip of these deposits is typically
to the south at about 5". decreasing gradually southwards. Thev consist of mixed
sequences of gravels. clavs. silts. sands. boulder beds. The most typical deposits of
these beds are the gravel spreads. with some lenticular fine-grained siltv or sandy
beds. Local bouider beds probablv represent mud floor deposits. In general, the
deposits became finer towards the south. These beds are of Pleistocene age, and have
a maximum thickness of about 300 m.
3.5.6  The "C" beds occur as flatlving deposits infilling depressions between the ridges of
"A" and "B" beds. Thev are poorlv exposed. and are similar lithologically to the "B"
beds. The gravels are poorlv sorted. and tend to become more extensive and more
continuous towards the south. Their maximum thickness is about 150 m.
3.5.7  The "D" beds are the most recent and occur within the present river beds and form
gravel fans covering parts of Shemran and the further suburbs of the city. They also
thin southwards, having a maximum thickness of up to 20 m but are typically between
3 and 4 m thick.
3.5.8  Hydrogeologically, the "B" beds and the 'C" beds are very similar. The "D" beds are relatively
insignificant and difficult to distinguish from the "C" beds.
3.5.9  The Alluvium of the Varamin Plain has not been studied in as much detail as that of
the Tehran Plain. However. it is very similar. consisting of non indurated gravels,
sands. silts and clays. Grain size decreases awav from the mountains. so that south of
an east to west line through the town of Varam in. the upper horizons of the alluvium
become sufficient fine grained to act as a confirming horizontal to groundwater.
Groundwater Movement
3.5.10 The alluvium of the "B" and "C" beds of the Tehran Plain, and the alluvium of the
Varamin Plain, form good aquifers. Both the permeability and the grain size of the
alluvium tend to be greater near the mountains. where the river flows are larger. The
rivers therefore recharge the alluvium (supplemented by limited quantities of winter
rain) at their highest levels, so the ground water flows generally southwards.
following the surface slope. The hills of bedrock to the north-east of Shahr-e-Rey,
which become covered with alluvium in a westerly direction, and a decrease in
permeability, tend to, under natural conditions. cause groundwater levels in the
alluvium to rise. The same effects, can be seen to the east of Varamin town. Here
permeabilities decrease because of decreasing grain size to such an extent, that under
natural conditions, the original wells have overflowed as a result of artesian pressure.
34



Groundwvater Resouirces
3.5.1 1 Originallv. the groundwater resources of both the Tehran Plain and Varamin Plain
were similar. Now. however. there are substantial differences as a result of the
abstraction of groundwater from the Varamin Plain. and the importation of water
supplies into the Tehran area. There is a serious excess of groundwater in the Tehran
Plain. and similarlv, excessive deficit of water in the Varamin Plain aquifer.
Grozundwater Resouirces Under The Tehran Plain
3.5.12  Groundwater from the Tehran Plain has been used for agricultural and domestic
purposes since eariv times. Qanats were constructed into the alluvium to carry
groundwater from the higher areas out onto the surface of the plain at lower altitudes.
The numbers of qanats were increased as more water was needed. In more recent
times. a number of wells and boreholes have been constructed for domestic, industrial,
and agricultural wvater supplies.
3.5.13 However. as the city has grown. the quality of the groundwater has deteriorated
because of the verv extensive use of sewage wells. These wells were dug into the
alluvium beneath or adjacent to properties sometimes down to a depth of 15 to 20 m.
As the citv has grown. more and more water has been "imported" into the city from
adjacent river basins such as the Karaj. After use. the sewage is discharged into the
sewage wells. The effect of this, throughout much of the city, is to recharge the
Tehran aquifer with substantial quantities of additional water. This has in turn caused
a rise in the level of the groundwater in those areas where permeabilities are lower,
that is the "A" beds under central and southern Tehran. The annual volume of water
supplied to Tehran has increased from 370 Mm3 in 1978 to 875 Mm3 in 1997.
3.5.14 As the city does not have a sewerage system. the vast bulk of this additional water,
once used, is discharged into the ground. Drawing EA/8 shows the groundwater
contours under the central part of Tehran in 1988. The depth to the water table from
the surface under a significant area of the citv is less than 10 metres. This rise in
groundwater levels is causing serious problems. Basements and cellars are becoming
flooded and sewagze wells are ceasing to function. Most properties have basements
which contain central heating equipment for use in winter, and air conditioning
equipment for use in summer. Such equipment is damaged when it becomes flooded.
More seriously, from a public health viewpoint. sewage wells are ceasing to function.
Furthermore. the fabric of many properties is becoming damaged. Because they are
constructed without a damp-proof membrane. dampness rises up the walls.
3.5.15 To combat the problem of rising groundwater levels, the TRWB has constructed 100
wells in the central Tehran area. These have been specifically constructed and located
in an attempt to keep the water table at least 10 m below the surface. The total annual
abstraction was approximately 80 Mm3 in 1991. Electricity cost. plus those of
maintenance are high. Corrosion of the pumps necessitates a regular maintenance
programme.
3.5.16 There are a number of abstraction boreholes in the northern part of Tehran, away from
the areas underlain by the "A" beds. Abstractions of groundwater for public supplies
35



have increased from a total of 20 Mm3/yr in 1978 to 138 Mm3/vr in 1991. There are
also abstraction boreholes south of Tehran in'the Shahr-e-Rev area. Here there are 30
wells. between 60 and 70 m deep which were drilled in 1976/77 to provide water for
irrigation. They currently pump water at nearly 0.5 m3/s (I 6 Mm3/yr).
3.5.17 Qanats are a significant feature of the Tehran Plain. They provide water to the
southern part of the plain, but are also verv important in helping to keep the level of
the water table down in central Tehran. The TRWB has constructed at least one
specificallv for this purpose.
Groundwater Resources Under the Varamin Plain
3.5.18 The aquifer beneath the Varamin Plain is principally supplied with water from the
Jaj-e-Rud river and the associated irrigation canals supplemented by small amounts of
winter rainfall. A number of qanats have been dug in historic times, but now the
groundwater is abstracted bv conventional wells and boreholes. The number of wells
has increased from 321 in 1970 to 1.759 in 1989.
3.5.19 The volume of groundwater abstracted has similarlv increased from 252 Mm3 in 1965
to 475 Mm3 in 1989. The recharge to the aquifer in 1989 was calculated 346 Mm3,
but 475 Mm3 was abstracted. This means that 129 Mm3 more water was pumped out
of the aquifer than recharged to it. This "mining" of the groundwater is recognized as
a serious problem by the authorities. The construction of the diversion dam on the
Jaj-e-Rud River, and its associated recharge lagoons, means that the water resources
of the area can more effectively be used, but there is likely to be a continuing deficit
of water in the region. The average over-abstraction of groundwater from the Varamin
Plain, has been calculated at 78 Mm3 a year for the last five years.
3.5.20 The depth to the water table has increased in recent years. Near the head of the plain,
water levels have dropped from 50 to 90 m depth, and those around Varamin town
have fallen from 25 to 30 m.
3.5.21  Over abstraction has caused a number of qanats feeding the southem part of the plain
to become dry. This has. in turn. caused significant areas of formnerly productive
agricultural land to be abandoned. Also, "mining" of the groundwater has caused a
number of formeriy artesian wells to stop overflowing. Artesian flows of 0.05 to 0.06
m3/s have now ceased. A strict licensing system for the issue of permits to drill new
wells means that the rate of decline in water levels should decrease.
Groundwater Quality Under the Tehran Plain
3.5.22 The sewage of virtually the whole of Tehran (except for a few small, recently
developed areas) is discharged into the ground at some point, either within the city or
via surface waters. The effect of this is to reduce the qualitv of the groundwater under
the city, which is not currently abstracted for potable use. Drawing EA/9 shows the
isonitrate contours for the Tehran area. The highest values considerably exceed the
WHO guideline for drinking water of 45 mg/I as N03. These broadly correspond to
those areas where the water table is highest. that is. under central and southern
36



Tehran. Groundwater from outside the city is abstracted for potable use. but is not of
such poor quality.
3.5.23  A study of samples taken from 13 wells in the central area of Tehran from 1987 to
1991 revealed that WHO guideline concentrations for drinking water were not
exceeded for total dissolved solids, iron. chromium. cobalt, cadmium. copper. lead,
nickel, zinc or manganese. Conductivities ranged from about 850 to 1250 micro
mho/cm. The mean nitrate concentration was 76 mg/l as NO3, and the mean
ammonia concentration was 2.0 mg/l as N. exceeding the EC maximum acceptable
concentration for drinking water of 0.5 me/l (there is no WHO limit). Both the latter
are svmptomatic of sewage poliution.
Groundwater Qualitv Under the Varamin Plain
3.5.24 The quality of the groundwater beneath the Varamin Plain is generally good. Much of
the water of the aquifer comes from the Jaj-e-Rud river. which. apart from the
suspended solids content is of excellent qualitv. The suspended solids are obviously
filtered out. so the aquifer is recharged with high qualitv water. As an excess of
irrigation water is used. the amounts of dissolved salts increase. causing the shallow
groundwater to become slightly more saline than the deeper groundwater. As the
depth to the water table is considerable. this slisht "flushing " action ensures that there
is no build up of salts in the soil. In September 1989 the electrical conductivity of the
shallow groundwater varied from 500 to 1,000 pmho/cm near Varamin town and the
diversion dam, and reached 5,000 pmho/cm at the edge of the irrigation area.
Chloride levels follow a similar pattern, with less than 30 mg/I around the head of the
plain, increasing to 50 mg/l near Varamin town and exceeding 200 mg/I at the
margins.
3.5.25 The practice of winter irrigation, when water is available, helps to leach salts from the
soil, thereby helping to maintain soil salinities at a low level. The salts are washed
into the aquifer. but do not appear to seriouslv reduce the quality of the groundwater.
3.6           Agriculture in the Varamin Plain
Background
3.6.1   Agriculture has been practiced for centuries on the Varamin Plain using irrigation
water diverted from the many branches of the alluvial fan of the Jaj-e-Rud and a qanat
system in the south of the Plain. This diverted water flow is highly variable,
depending on rainfall and snowmelt. More recently wells were drilled to provide a
more constant supply, but by the late 1960s over-abstraction of the aquifers was
leading to reduced qanat flows in the south. A FAO study proposed a concrete canal
gravity flow irrigation water distribution system using Jaj-e-Rud water controlled by
an upstream diversion dam. and seasonally supplemented by pumped groundwater.
The FAO identified 70,000 ha of land suitable for irrigation on the Plain, of which
50,000 hectares are canalized and 35,000 ha are currently irrigated and cropped.
Seasonal water shortages are experienced over this area. but at periods of high river
flow. water is diverted into large ponds and some aquifer recharge achieved. During
37



times of peak irrigation demand the Tehran canal is used to convev about I m3/s of
groundwater from Shahr-e-Rev to the Varamin Plain.
3.6.2  The Varamin project. 40 km from Tehran by good roads. is ideallv suited to supply
the Tehran popuiation with a wide range of crops. This range can be extended by the
adoption of more intensive production systems and this is beeinnin2 ivith the use of
plastic structures to produce early vegetables.
Soils
3.6.3  Evidence of soil qualitv has been drawn from a 1968 Soil Institute Survey, the FAO
report and visual observation of soils and crops of the Varamin Plain. Prior to
implementation of the irrigation scheme. salinity problems were recorded. These areas
have now been leached out verv effectively under intensive cropping, and no visual
salinitv symptoms were observed in crops.
3.6.4  The soils are of a loamv type with a stone/gravel fraction. varving from clav loam to
sandy loam. The clav content increases to the south, conversely the stone content
increases northward. Top soils are deep, and the depth of the alluvial fan is
considerable over most of the area. Only to the southwestem boundary of the project
is there any evidence of shallower soils. In this area. but outside the area of the
project. unirrigated areas are covered in surface salt. suggesting upward capillary rise
of moisture from a shallow water table.
3.6.5  The soils have pH of 7 to 8.2, and organic matter is low at 0.5 to 1.0%. nitrogen and
phosphate levels are both low, but potassium is high at an average of 420 mgtkg.
Salinitv is low under present irrigation practice, where there is clearlv a very adequate
leaching fraction. The presence in the soil of calcium. carbonate and gypsum was
noted by the Soil Institute. This is favorable for the use of saline waters, and for the
immobilization of heavy metals (given high pH).
3.6.6  From the available soil data. and crop observations. the area seems highly suited to
irrigated crop production with some exceptionally favorable characteristics such as
high pH. good natural drainage, favorable texture. good qualitv irrigation waters and
favorable topography.
Crops and Cultivation Practices
3.6.7  The crops which are grown on Varamin Plain are mostly annual, with limited areas of
perennial alfalfa and fruit orchards. Usually one crop is grown per year with only 3%
of the area reported to be double cropped. The main crops have historically been
wheat and cotton, but recently there has been an increasing emphasis on fruit and
vegetables for the high Tehran market. Currently 40% of the agricultural area is
given over to wheat and barley, 23% to cotton. 3% to sunflowers and the remaining
34% to fruit and vegetables.
3.6.8  The basic cultivation practice used is mould board ploughinz to a depth of about 0.23
m, followed by disc harrowing and ridging for various forns of flood irrigation. All
are carried out with tractors.
38



Livestock Rearing
3.6.9   A large number of livestock are kept on the Varamin Plain with many reared within
the irrigation area. The 1987 population comprised some 37.000 cattle. 30,000 sheep
and 10.000 goats. and 261 poultrv units. Additionallv, about 250.000 migrant goat and
sheep are reported to graze the area between March and June. There are also seven
fish ponds.
3.6.10 Cattle are generally fenced and poultry kept in indoor units. Both usually take their
drinking water from boreholes. Sheep and eoats. however. generallv range the area
consuming crop residues and grazing alfalfa. Their most common water source is the
arterial and field irrization canals. The available data on riverand groundwater quality
showv that by FAO standards. these waters are either excellent or verv satisfactory for
livestock in terms of salinity. However. for the limited number of trace elements
analyzed for in groundwater. manganese is possibly high (no absolute standard is
available for livestock. onlv humans) but the others are well within accepted limits.
The concentration of lead in water from one well has exceeded FAO standards for the
qualitv of livestock water.
Sources and Qualitv of Irrigation Water
3.6.11 The current water supply to the Varamin Irrigation Scheme is from the Jaj-e-Rud river
and boreholes within the scheme area. In periods of flood, the river carries a high silt
load. The concrete canals are designed to maintain high flow velocities and keep this
silt in suspension, but in the unlined field channels severe silt deposition necessitates
regular cleaning. The total river flow varies, from 200 to 1,200 Mm3/yr, according to
snow and rainfall levels in the catchment. This causes the variability, and hence,
instabilitv of the irrigation water supply.
3.6.12  Presently around 12 Mm3/yr of water is abstracted from boreholes near the proposed
STP site at Shahr-e-Rev. This supply is reportedly contaminated with untreated
sewaze which has percolated down to the underground aquifer. The water is conveyed
to the irrigation area along the Tehran canal at periods of peak irrigation water
demand. Historically farmers have not been charged for water, but since the inception
of the canalized irrigation scheme thev have been charged.
3.6.13  The current quality of the irrigation water is generally considered good. A few wells
which are pumped within the scheme yield water of up to 1280 mg/l total dissolved
solids. which is classified as a moderate to high salinity hazard. These must, however.,
be viewed in the context of them contributing a very small volume of the total
irrigation supply. In general. the waters classify as being of low sodium hazard andi
medium salinity. As such they are very suited for the range of crops grown.
3.6.14 The quality of the Jaj-e-Rud water was analyzed in the 1970s, indicating it to be of
suitable quality for irrigation. Underground waters near Asgar Abad in the Varamirl
Plain were found in 1989 to have heavy metal concentrations all well below the
tolerable maxima recommended by the FAO for use in irrigation. Indeed the presence
of copper, iron. manganese and zinc in the groundwater could be beneficial to crop
39



production given the alkaline nature of Varamin soils. The river water would not be
expected to contain high or problematic levels of heavy metals. since there are no
population centres above Tehran on the Jaj-e-Rud.
3.6.15  The analvses of the river and groundwaters both gyenerallv recorded higher levels of
sulfate than chloride in the anion fraction: this would be beneficial in controlling any
salinitv hazards. The bicarbonate levels are moderate. and would onlv be a problem
under sprinkler irrigation.
Irrigation Practices
3.6.16 The irrigation is virtually all of a flood tvpe. mainlv by furrows for cereals and cotton,
but a small area of alfalfa is irrigated bv sprinklers. Small basins tend to be used for
most vegetable production. but cucumbers and melons are often grown on raised beds,
with irrigation furrows dug between the beds. Border strips and furrows are both used
for alfalfa. There is virtually no irrigation in Januarv or Februarv, however, some
farmers apply a single watering, reportedlv to. kill insects and leach the soil.
3.6.17 The efficiency of irrigation has been reported to be poor. The FAO originally
conceived the scheme to be 64% efficient. but field losses are probably above the 226
Mm3/yr level. The main causes are poor land levels in fields and seepage losses from
the unlined canals. Where leveling of fields has been undertaken, the uniformity of
crop growth is superior.
3.6.18 The irrigation canals are also used for washing clothes.
Crop Yields
3.6.19 The current crop yields of the Varamin Plain are not monitored by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Co-operation. They are reportedly low due to a variety of
factors including shortage of fertilizers. poor land levels. seasonal water shortages,
and lack of an effective support service for farmers.
3.6.20 Observation of the spring crops in May 1992 has supported these views: poor weed
control in cereals and use of outdated wheat were also areas of concern. It was
observed, however, that the standard of management was good given the prevailing
input constraints. and examples of verv good vezetable and wheat crops were
observed where land had been leveled. In the absence of reported yields, local
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Co-operation officials suggested that yields were
still at about the level recorded by FAO in 1970. However, they did report that a very
good farmer had achieved 10 to 11 tonnes of wheat per hectare, which is very high,
and indicates the potential of the area.
Use of Fertilizers
3.6.21 No information regarding the quantities or application rates of fertilizers are available.
Artificial and animal fertilizers are used at present.
40



Farm Labour
3.6.22  Most of the farm labour is performed by Afghan immigrants and each winter several
hundred seasonal workers come to work on the cotton farmns. Workers and owners do
not live on farms. but in the village and towvns on the Varamin Plain.
Agricuilture in Other Areas
3.6.23  Aericulture in other areas to the south of the city itself. is being carried out on an
unregulated basis. Water is obtained from Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals, and
is used to irrigate crops. Sludge and plastics from the canals no longer are being used
by locals.
3.6.24  A study to assess the extent of contamination of soil and crops grown in these areas
with use of the canal water and sludge concluded that cadmium and zinc
concentrations in soil were exceeding permissible levels. although some of the
cadmium was probablv derived from phosphate fertilizers. Cadmium is a cumulative
poison that can be harmful to humans and livestock. Heavv metal concentrations in
crops were rarely found to be above recommended values but in some cases cadmium
and lead exceeded these. Lead is not normally taken up by the edible parts of crops to
any significant extent. the main risk being direct contamination of edible parts with
sludge or wastewater.
3.7           Health
Standards of Public Health
3.7.1  Information has been obtained from a number of source documents regarding the
current patterns of disease within Iran and particularly Tehran. Crude death rates and
infant mortality provide gross measures of public health and wellbeing. There was a
pattern of decreasing mortality rates for the period 1956 to 1972, which has been
attributed to the provision of an adequate svstem for potable water supplies.
3.7.2   More recent data (1990) concerned with a range of diseases which mav be considered
to be waterbome, are available from the Ministry of Health records. For the Tehran
area, these show that over 100,000 cases of potentially waterborne illness were
clinically diagnosed during 1990. The following diseases were recorded .
* cholera (El Tor biotype);
* typhoid & paratyphoid;
* shigellosis (bacterial dysentery);
* amoebic dysentery;
* infectious hepatitis (hepatitis a); and
* helminthic disease (infection by intestinal parasites)
Of these. the two major classes of illness diagnosed were shigellosis (60%) and
helminthic diseases (36.5%). The incidence of water related diseases such as diarrhea
is decreasing but still significant. The number of cases of infection with intestinal
parasites has decreased from 12,000 in 1994 to about 5.000 in 1997.
41



3.7.3   Dysenterv due to Shigella may be spread via contaminated water or food. However,
the most important means of transmission is from person to person. usuallv within the
domestic or institutional environment (schools. hospitals. etc). Hence, the current
pattem of sewage treatment and disposal may not be the major factor determining the
prevalence of this disease.
3.7.4  The incidence of parasitic diseases mediated by helminths is reported to be between
30% and 60%. A survev of inhabitants in the Shahr-e-Rev area was conducted over a
14 month period from March 1990 to April 1991. This revealed that 54% of the 8,810
faecal samples examined were found to contain parasites. There was a significantly
greater proportion of females infected with helminths compared with males;
3088/4750 (65%) and 1663/4750 (35%). respectively.
3.7.5  There are three primary contexts for helminth transmission (principallv Ascaris and
Trichuris):
transmission within areas immediately adjacent to dwellings that have been
contaminated directly by feces. especiallv those of children:
transmission to persons working in agriculture where night soil or sewage is
used as a fertilizer,
transmission to persons consuming vegetables that have been grown in fields
to which night soil or sewage have been applied.
3.7.6  Transmission within the immediate dwelling area is probably the dominant mode in
areas of poverty and inadequate sanitation. This is not the case in Shahr-e-Rey where
98% of the population are served by a piped water supply and it is reported that 59%
of houses have a bath fitted.
3.7.7  The area around STP proposed site is an important vegetable growing location where
some of the farns use untreated sewage effluent as a source of irrigation water.
Consideration of the epidemiology of helminth infections leads one to the conclusion
that the high prevalence of parasitic diseases is almost certainly the consequence of
the cultivation, harvesting, preparation or consumption of crops irrigated with
contaminated water.
3.7.8  The potential risk of schistosomiasis has recently been investigated. and there is no
evidence to suggest that it is of epidemiological concern.
3.7.9 Though malaria is prevalent in the southern provinces of Iran bordering the Persian
Gulf, it is not common in other parts of Iran including Tehran Province.
Surface Waters
3.7.10 The discharge of wastewater to open watercourses (jubes) results in significant
contamination with faecally derived microorganisms. Results of surveys intended to
assess the microbiological quality of surface waters have been carried out
42



periodically. Data in the Pre-investment Survey show that levels of faecal coliforms
were as high as 1.6 x 10(+6)/lOOml. This survey also revealed the presence of human
pathogens inciuding Salmonella tvphii. other salmonellas and helminths.
3.7.11 The results of more recent surveys carried out between November 1991 and March
1992 reveal a similar pattern with counts of faeccal coliforms between 2 x 10(+5) and
1.6 x 10(+6)/lOOml. Ascaris and other helminths were also isolated. It is evident that
there has been little or no improvement during the intervening period.
3.7.12 The zoonotic infections. Anthrax and Brucella. in cattle and goats have been reported
as being present in the country, although vaccination programmes are in place. It
would therefore be prudent to assume that the causative organisms (Bacillus anthracis
and Brzicella sp.: probablv B. melitensis) will be present in the sewage to be treated.
Sources would include drainage from livestock handling areas. abattoirs, and
tanneries. Dilution by unaffected effluents would greatlv reduce the concentration of
these orgzanisms entering surface water canals. The use of these canals as source of
water for livestock wvatering or irrigation of grazing areas potentially contributes to
the cvcle of infection.
3.7.13  Surveys have shown that the sludges arising from settlement of contaminated water
taken from the Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals may contain levels of cadmium
greatly in excess of the recommended by the EC as being suitable for agricultural use.
Cadmium is a highly toxic metal which tends to bioaccumulate. The agricultural use
of these wvastewaters and resultant sludges can only be considered detrimental to
human health, with potentially long-term effects.
Groundwater
3.7.14  Data showing amounts of nitrate in groundwater in the Tehran area give rise for
concern. Several areas experience levels in excess of recommended limits for drinking
water. These sources are little used as drinking water supplies at present within the
Tehran area.
3.8            Climate
3.8.1   The climate of the Tehran and Varamin area is essentially that of the central Iranian
Plateau and is defined as continental, semi-arid to arid. The summers are dry and hot,
with most rain falling in the winter and early spring. The meteorology is highly
variable, however, from month to month and from year to year.
Precipitation
3.8.2   Precipitation mostly occurs from October to April (over 80% of the annual total),
when frontal disturbances associated with low pressure systems move from the
Mediterranean and Black Sea areas. An appreciable part of this falls as snow during
the winter months, particularly in the northern area. Summer and early Autumn are
usually very dry.
43



3.8.3   Annual rainfall levels varv greatly from year to year ranging from approximatelv 50%
to 190% of the mean value. Levels are directly related to altitude. ranging from
approximately 200 mm at Shahr-e-Rev in the south to 450 mm at Darband in the
north. Tehran Plain and Varamin Plain experience lower levels. and average mean
annual rainfall figures are computed to be:
Tehran City          225 mm
Tehran Plain         205 mm
Varamin Plain        155 mm
Temperature
3.8.4  Diumal and seasonal temperature variations are both extreme. In the coldest months
of Januarv and Februarv temperatures of as low as -10 to -20° C are observed,
whereas in the hottest months of July and August, temperatures can exceed 40 C.
Temperatures at night often drop 20 to 25' C below the daytime maximum. Average
temperatures for Tehran and Varamin are v-ery similar. except that spring
temperatures (Februarv to May) are 3 to 4' C higher on the Varamin Plain.
Relative HEumidity
3.8.5  Extremely low values are reached in the summer time. when the relative air humidity
may be as low as 20 percent at midday, rising to 63 percent in the early morning.
Average daily values are 20 to 30 % in the summer (May to August) and 30 to 65% in
the winter. The relative humidity of the Tehran and Varamin Plains is very similar
throughout the year.
Wind
3.8.6   Wind is an important consideration because of its effect on evaporation rates and
hence. water loss from lagoons and exposed water bodies. Wind velocities tend to be
moderate in the northern and central Tehran areas. and higher in the south. The long
terrn average wind velocitv is 9.8 km/hr. The windiest month is usually April. with an
average wind velocity of 1 1:8 km/hr and average maximum of 29.8 km/hr.
3.8.7  In the Varamin Plain. the prevailing wind is west-southwesterly. and north westerly.
Further north in Tehran. the direction of the strongest winds is mostly northerly.
Evaporation
3.8.8  Rates of evaporation increase with temperature. therefore. are highest during the hot
summer months. In Tehran (Mehrabad Airport meteorological station) the annual
evaporation is 1,674 mm with a peak rate of 240 to 250 mm/month in June and July.
In the center of the Varamin Plain the evaporation is 2,295 mm/year with a peak rate
of 410 mm/month.

3.9          Biological Environment
Flora
3.9.1  The plant cover in the Tehran Region is limited due to its climate. which is moderate
in the mountainous area and semi-arid in the plains. The growing season is, for many
species. confined to the spring, when temperatures are warm enough and there is
sufficient rainfall.
3.9.2  The most important species of plants currentlv growing on the plains and lower
mountain slopes are: thorn bushes (all tvpes). teasel. sainfoin. astragalus. soap root.
alfalfa. ervsium. wild rue. prickly artichoke. moonflower. tavatera. sweet rout, rye
grass. artemisia (wormrseed), hedge garlic. gramineous. wild iris and poppy anemone.
3.9.3  Approximatelv 1.4 million hectares in the Tehran Region is rangeland. open
undulating landscape dominated by grasses Xith few trees. Overgrazing has caused
deterioration of the rangeland and localized soil erosion. One third of the rangeland is
used as summer resort ranges and the rest as winter resort ranges.
3.9.4  On the hillsides northeast of Tehran. the remains of Persian turpentine trees are
scattered irregularly, along with: hawthorn, wild greengage, barberis, fig, snowberry,
and almond.
3.9.5  Several areas of recreational forest have been planted to the east of Tehran, and on
hillsides surrounding the Latian Dam on the Jaj-e-Rud. The forest also helps to
prevent soil erosion and slippage into the reservoir. The areas of forest east of Tehran
are: Sorkhe Hessar (700 ha); Khodjir (140 ha); Telov (400 ha); Latian (300 ha); and
Doshan Tappeh (370 ha). Of these, Sorkhe Hessar and Khodjir Forests are within
areas designated as National Parks. The nearest of these areas to the city boundary is
Sorkhe Hessar. where belts of artificial forest fringe the eastern part of Tehran and
include two racetracks.
3.9.6  South and south-east of Tehran, some parts of the region have a natural appearance of
hills and plains, whose halophyte (plants tolerant of high salt concentrations) and
xerophvte (plants adapted to drv conditions) covers are tvpical of poor shallow
alkaline soils with extrusive stones and salinity problems. The plants have nco
outstanding characteristics; there are no naturallv grown trees or shrubs and the
ground cover is very scattered and deteriorated. The major species present are:
Acamthelirnon, Aconthophullum, Astragalus, Alhaji, Artemisia, Pegamus, Capparia,
Andrachne, Dendrostellera, Heliotropium. Salsolla. Ephedra, Centurea. Alyssum,
Liziphora. Euphorbia. Boissiera, Anabasis. Brobus, Erodrum and Sueda.
Ornithology
3.9.7  Some surface waters receiving wastewaters form habitats for manv waterfowl. These
include Ghaleh Nou. which is fed by Firouzabad Canal. where over 1.200 birds have
been ringed for identification purposes.
45



3.9.8  The main species of wvaterfowl. waders. tree dwellers and predators of the wetlands

Pied Wagtail                Motacilla alba
Sylvia Warblers (various)   Sylvia -spp.
3.9.9  The above birds use the receiving water habitats for several purposes. Species such as
the swallow use it for drinking; warblers and herons nest in the reeds. buntings and
46



sparrows feed on grainv plants: flvcatchers feed on the insects present: and molluscs
are hunted bv waders such as plovers. shanks and sandpipers. Hunting birds including
buzzards. kestrels and eagles feed off the small mammals and reptiles around the
water bodies.
Protected Habitats
3.9.10  With the implementation of the new Environmental Protection Law in Iran. and the
creation of Department of Environment (DOE). the previously protected regions have
been reclassified. There are presently 8 National Parks. 46 Protected Areas. and 15
Protected Rivers. representing nearlv everv major habitat found in the country. The
total land encompassed bv these designated areas is around 7.2 million hectares.
3.9.11  The protected habitats in the vicinity of the project area are listed in Table 3.5.
Table 3.5      Protected habitats near the project area
RefNo. Name of Area    Designation     Area [ha]       Location
7       Sorke Hessar    National Park    9.380         East of Tehran
6       Khogir         National Park   II. 570         East of Tehran
4       Kavir          National Park    420.000        Southeast of Tehran
56      Kavir          Protected Area   250.000        Southeast of Tehran
46     Jaj-e-Rud       Protected Area    51.650        Southeast of Tehran
82     Jaj-e-Rud       Protected River   -             East of Tehran
79      Karaj          Protected River   -             West & South of Tehran
3.9.12  Of these areas, the only ones potentially affected by the project are the Kavir Protect
Area and the Karaj River. The former extends northwards from, the boundary of the
Kavir National Park (an area of greater importance) and borders the southern edge of
the Varamin irrigation area. The protected section of the Karaj River is an area of
approximately 1500 ha to the southwest of Eshghabad and Chal Tarkhan villages.
These are shown on DrawingEA/16.
3.9.13  The major river in the Kavir Protected Area is the Band Alikhan River. formed by the
confluence of the Karaj and Jaj-e-Rud. The wastewaters of Tehran eventually reaches
this river via Firouzabad Canal and Sorkhe Hessar Canal. The river flows south to Salt
Lake and is an important habitat for waterfowl and waders.
Protected Species
3.9.14 Another consequence of the establishment of Iran's DOE has been the implementation
of regulations to protect endangered species. Protected species include: Persian fallow
deer, Caspian tiger, onager gazelle; bear (Selenarctos thibetanus)p cheetah (Acinonyx
jubatusu); crocodile (Crocodylus palustris); great bustard: and Caucasian black grouse.
3.9.15 Although, in general. little is known about the diversity or magnitude of Iran's biota, i:
is recognized that the best way of protecting endangered species is the establishmenl
of special reserves and protected areas, where most of these species are found. There
are no endangered species present within the areas directlv affected by the proposed
project.
47



3.10          Other Developments
Relocation of Industries
3.10.1 In order to improve the amenity of Tehran and reduce pollution, especiallv of surface
waters. the government is implementing a phased relocation of industrv outside of the
city. The DOE recognized 23 types of industrv Nwithin the city as particularly polluting
and unable to meet their standards for cities. 6.500 hectares of land, to the south of
Tehran have been allocated for these new industrial estates in 6 locations. One of
these is at Charmshar to the south of the Varamin irrigzation area. The slaughterhouse
has alreadv been transferred and the next industries to be moved will be the
soap-making and metal plating industries currentlv located in regions 15 and 16. In
addition. all livestock husbandry is to be relocated to Fashapoyeh. outside Tehran.
Provision of Green Spaces
3.10.2 A policv of increasing the area of green space wvithin Tehran was delayed during the
1980s. Since 1989, however. several large new parks have been established, such as
Pardisain Park (135 ha) north of the city and 2000 ha of parks around the graves of
former leaders in the south of the region.
Improvements to Services in Tehran
3.10.3 The Iranian government is undergoing a progzram of improvement to services in
Tehran. This will include the provision of recreation grounds and sports fields, local
libraries, parks. subways and new electric buses. To improve the public transport
infrastructure in Tehran. an underground rapid transit system has been designed and is
currently under construction. The Metro network will probably be extended in the
future. To alleviate Tehran's severe traffic congestion. there is an on-going program
of new roads and intersections. in addition to improvements to existing highwavs.
Water Supply Schemes
3.10.4 To meet increasing demands for water in Tehran. further dams are being proposed to
bring water into the catchment. The Taleghan Storage Dam has been planned, but not
yet constructed. in the Taleghan Vallev south of the Alborz mountains. The objectives
of the dam are to supply the Ghazvin Plain. generate hydroelectric power and supply
part of Tehran's future potable water needs. The proposed total annual release is 460
Mm3 /yr, of which 150 Mm3 /yr would be for municipal use.
Other Sewage Treatment Plants
3.10.5 The STPs currently administered by Tehran Sewerage Company in various locations
of Tehran are as follows:
I - GHEYTARIEH                     (currently serving a population of 15,000)
2- ZARGANDEH                       (currently serving a population of 25,000)
3 - SHARA - NASR                   (currently serving a population of 40,000)
48



4 - SAHEBGHARANIEH                 (currently serving a popuiation of 2,500)
5 - SHOOSH                         (currentlN serving a population of 75,000)
6 - EKBATAN                        (currentlv serving a population of 80.000)
7 - DOLAT - ABAD                   (currentlv serving a population of 55,000)
8 - MAHALAT                        (currentlv serving a population of 30,000)
9 - AEREATED LAGOONS               (currently serving a population of
OF SOUTHERN TEHRAN                 of 100.000)
Surface WEater Drainage
3.10.6 Tehran municipality has commenced a program of improvements to the surface water
drainage of the Citv, includina canal. river. tunnel, and sewer works. One scheme of
particular significance is the Khavam Main Drain and Third Outlet. which intercepts
existing surface water drains and includes 15 km of tunnel. ranging in size from 1.8 to
4.8 m intemal diameter at depths of up to 35 in. with associated access shafts. This
tunnel commences in the north of Tehran and discharges via an open channel to the
Kan River. to the south of the city. In addition. 300 kIm of open channels and
sediment/boulder trap structures are to bc constructed. These are iocated along ravines
in the southem slopes of the Alborz mountains to the north of the City.

4.0           ORGANIZATION, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY
CONSIDERATIONS
4.1           Background
4.1.1  In order for the proposed Tehran Sewerage Project to be successfully implemented
and operated. it Nvill be necessarv to have in place an efficient organizational structure
to manage the project and effective legislation & regulations guiding construction,
operational safetv, and control of pollution to land & water.
4.1.2  In this context. this section describes the existing organizational and legislative
background relating to the Project.
4.2           Organizational Structure
4.2.1   Whilst the Ministrv of Energy is the lead department with overall responsibility for
the implementation of the proposed project. there are a number of other central and
local government departments and service agencies with direct involvement in the
scheme or the "environment" in which it will operate. If the scheme is to be
constructed and operated successfully it is vital that the actions of these various
organizations are co-ordinated properly.
4.2.2  The following organizations will have direct or indirect involvement in the
scheme.
Water Supply and Seivage Treatment & Disposal
4.2.3  Responsibility at the local level for water resources, water supply, sewerage and
sewage treatment & disposal in Iran has recently been reorganized. Previously,
responsibility resided with regional water boards. including the Tehran Regional
Water Board (TRWB).
4.2.4  In March 1992, the TRWB was reorganized into tNvo separate organizations. The
TRWB remains in existence. with responsibility limited to surface and groundwater
resources development and management (covering the same: water basin as
previously), with several provincial water supply and sewerage companies created.
4.2.5  The provincial companies will be semi-private companies responsible for the
provision of water supply, sewerage, sewage treatment. and for the maintenance of
related facilities. The companies will purchase raw water from TRWB.
4.2.6  The Tehran Province Water and Sewerage Company (TPWSC) will cover Tehran and
23 surrounding urban areas. Similar arrangements will be made on a country-wide
basis for all water basins and provinces in Iran.
4.2.7  These organizations are under the overall control of the Ministry of Energy, which has
established an Advisory and Support Unit to assist the Boards and the Companies in
their development.
50



4.2.8  For TPWSC. an organizational structure based on five main divisions of responsibility
is established:
* Technical
* Finance
Regional Affairs
Planning
* Operations (of water treatment. water supplv. sewerage and sewvage treatment
in province of Tehran)
The Operations Division is currentlv under review. and separation of water and
sewerage responsibilities is being worked out.
4.2.9  The TPWSC is owned by the Tehran Regional Water Board (39%), the Water and
Sewerage Engineering Company (affiliated to the Ministry of Energy) (10%), the
Mahab Ghods Consulting Engineers (18%). and the Tehran Provincial Municipalities
(33%). It has the following corporate structure: General Assembly, Board of
Directors. Managing Director. and the Inspector. The General Assembly is composed
of representatives of the shareholders with the Minister of Energy as Chairman.
4.2.10 In order for the proposed Tehran Sewerage Project to be successfullv implemented
and operated in a large metropolitan area. an efficient organizational structure to
manage it was necessary; therefore in 1996 Tehran Sewage Company (TSC) was
established. TSC is owned by TPWSC (80 %). Varamin Water & Sewerage Company
(10 %) and southwest Tehran Water & Sewage Company (10%). Its corporate
structure is similar to TPWSC, and it is responsible for collection and treatment of
sewage in greater Iran. Figure 4.1 presents the organization chart for TPWSC.
4.2.11 A Project Management Unit (PMU) is to be established within the TSC to implement
the Tehran Sewerage Project. This will be responsible for the following:
-Financial management:
-Design of works:
-Supervision of contractors: and
-Ensuring that measures to mitigate adverse environmental impacts are carried out.
Environmental Protection and Pollution Control
4.2.12 Environmental protection and pollution control in Iran is the responsibility of the
Department of Environment (DOE). The DOE is responsible to a policy making board
called the Environmental High Council, consisting of representatives from various
Ministries. This Council is chaired by the Vice President. Also represented are the
Budget and Planning Organization and the National Iranian Oil Company. The DOE is

4.3 6   The regulations for the discharoe of wastes to the various classes of water are mainly
related to specified resultant conditions in the receiving. vaters. For Class I to Class 5
waters. these conditions cover increases in temperature. suspended solids and
chemical substances: reductions in dissolved oxygen: and limits on pH. Classes 1, 2,
and 5 waters have additional conditions for toxic substances. and Class I waters, there
is an additional condition on biochemical oxvgen demand (BODs).
4. 3.7   Conditions relating to wastes discharged to Classes 1. 2. and 5 waters include limits
on settleable solids and the exclusion of pathogenic organisms. Thev also prohibit for
Class I waters, the storage of rubbish and waste materials on river banks. Regulations
for waters in Class 6 prohibit the discharge of wastes containing faeces or wastes of
industrial or agricultural origin into drains of public roads. although such discharges
are allowed under certain conditions, such as. if disposal to a public sewer or to
underground strata is impossible. These conditions require that the effluents do not
emit objectionable odors or contain organisms and place a limit on settleable solids.
Additional conditions for effluents containing industrial or agricultural wastes include
a limit on temperature. pH values. These regulations also specifv that fuels (including
petrol and lubricating oil) are absent.
4.3.8   Conditions for the discharge of industrial wvaste water into public sewers are also
covered in the Regulations. Permission is required by license from the appropriate
authority for the discharge of all such effluents and in considering an application for a
discharge, the authority is required to consider the protection of sewers and
wastewater treatment works, the safety of health of personnel. and the cost of
treatment. Industries are required to construct their own treatment plants but in special
circumstances the authority may allow direct discharges of wastewater to a sewerage
system for treatment elsewhere. General conditions for the issue of licenses to
discharge industrial wastewater are given in the Regulations and these include limits
on temperature. pH values. suspended solids. fat or grease. and size of particles. They
also prohibit certain inflammable and toxic substances. Industries must provide
sampling chambers and if required bv the designated authoritv. flow measurement
facilities. In addition, the designated authority shall be allowed to take samples of
wastewater and measurements of flow.
4.3.9  In addition to these regulations. there are separate standards published bv the DOE in
1973 entitled the "Maximum Permissible Discharge of Pollutants to the environment".
These standards are defined by end use: surface water, groundwater, and irrigation.
The irrigation standards appear to be based on FAO standards. The source of other
standards is unknown.
4.3.10 Following the establishment of the Islamic Government. a new constitutional law was
enacted, part of which dealt with the protection of the environment. Any economic or
non-economic activity which would be destructive to nature or result in environmental
pollution is prohibited.
4.3.11  This law introduced two main principles: firstly that environmental protection was not
just the responsibility of the government but of all citizens. and secondlv, that no
economic activitY should cause pollution (as specified bv regulations).
56



4.3 .12  In order to implement these fundamental principles. the constitution stipulated that the
need for environmental protection be introduced into all other aspects of law in the
countrv.
4.3.13  In 1982. the Clean Water Act was passed bv Parliament. In addition to prohibiting the
pollution of water, this Act placed new responsibilities on the owners of water wells
and subterranean canals to. within their ability, prevent their pollution. In
circumstances where it was beyond their abilitv. they v ere required to use the
'uidance and assistance of relevant Govemment Ministries. who were obliged to
prevent pollution and to provide necessarv assistance.
4.3.14 The DOE wvas given responsibilitv for preparing the necessary regulations for
submission to the Council of Ministers for their approval.
4.3.15  One major initiative of the Clean Water Act is to require institutions and private sector
organizations who use water for domestic. industrial. mining. and cattle breeding
purposes to submit their proposals for wastewater treatment for approval to the
relevant authorities.
4.3.16 The DOE wvas also given the task. in conjunction with other relevant Ministries, of
identifving and studying the existing quality of Iranian water resources. On
identifying sources of pollution. the Department is required to review, compile data
and then enforce relevant standards for water pollution control.
4.3.17 An inter-ministry committee was formed to advise on the establishment of appropriate
regulations for the disposal of effluent into public water courses and to classify
surface receiving waters. ground waters, lakes and coastal waters to determine their
suitability and capacitv for receiving effluent.
4.3.18  Offices responsible for permits for the establishment of industrial and agricultural
units were required to notify applicants of the regulations of the DOE. Where it was
determined that a reduction or abatement of pollution from an industrial unit was not
feasible other than bv relocation. the DOE was empowered. with the assistance of
relevant Ministries to prepare relocation proposals which must bc implemented by the
owners after approval bv the Council of Ministers.
4.3.19 The Municipalities are bound to notifv architectural or engineering companies
responsible for new urban development of the requirements of the DOE regulations.
4.3.20  The First Socio-Economic and Cultural Development Plan published in 1989
contained proposals requiring ne'w industrial units to build appropriate waste water
treatment plants and install pollution control equipment before commencing
operation.
4.3.21 It was also proposed that the DOE should prepare plans for the elimination or
reduction of pollution in any area or province. Thev were also empowered to request
large industrial complexes and factories to contribute towards the cost of mobile
57



laboratories and equipment for monitorinz air and water pollution. DOE is largely
following up these proposals.
Groundwater Quzalitv
4.3.22 Other than the 1973 DOE Regulations. there are no specific regulations governing
ground waters. In particular. there are no regulations regarding aquifer protection.
Monitoring and Enforcement
4.3.23 Responsibilitv for monitoring and enforcement of these regulations currently rests
with the DOE. The Environment Protection Guards are currently responsible for
enforcement. while a separate Water and Soil Pollution Research Division is
responsible for water pollution monitoring.
4.3.24 Amongst the proposals of the First Socio-Econornic and Cultural Development Plan
published in 1989 was a requirement that a percentage of annual income of industrial
companies (0. 1 %) should be used for the procurement of facilities required for the
prevention and abatement of industrial pollution. This proposal was introduced into
law in 1990. and requires factories and workshops to put aside 0. I % of their annual
incomes in a separate fund. and to use this fund as directed bv the DOE in accordance
with the laws and regulations relating to environmental pollution. Funds not expended
in any particular financial year may be accrued for future years.
4.3.25 In the event that polluters are able to be traced. and a case proven against them, they
can be fined or imprisoned for up to one year.
Regulations Governing the Construction and Operation of Sewerage Facilities
4.3.26 Responsibility for making and enforcing regulations regarding building construction
standards. specifically regrarding the provision of water services lies between the
Ministrv of Energy, Housing and Urbanization. the TPWSC. TSC and the
municipality of Tehran.
4.3.27 The existing public sewerage systems in Tehran are often misused by public leading
to operational and treatment problems. This situation has arisen through the common
misbelieve that a sewer can carrv anv unwanted substance or object. To remedy this
problem, a public education campaign in affected areas is underway.
4.3.28 Draft regulations for the use of public sewers in Tehran have been included in the
Water Laws Act of 1991, which introduced the reorganization of the TRWB, as
discussed above.
Occupational Health and Safety
4.3.29 Facilities Establishment Act for Development of Urban Sewage and Water Networks
and Renovation projects. providing finances for water and sewaze projects was
passed bv parliament.
58



4.3.30 The Ministrv of Labor and Social Affairs is responsible for controlling occupational
safetv in Iran. The General Office of Labor Inspection of this Ministry have published
the following pamphlets as a guide for all emplovers.
the legislation and regulations of occupational safetv on construction sites:
the legislation and regulations of public health and safety in workshops;
* uidelines on safety and public health in workshops; and
the safety le_islations and regulations in the manual drilling of wells.
43.31 It is recognized that the existing regulations and legislation relating to the constructio)n
of the various seweraze elements and treatment works are inadequate and will need l:o
be revised.
Environmental Assessment
4.3.,3 2 There is a genera] requirement in law that economic activities should not cause
pollution and there are specific requirements for the preparation of environmental
impact assessments for major infrastructure projects.
4.3.33 There are regulations prepared bv the DOE which deal generally with the prevention
of pollution to water courses.
The Appendix presents the Iranian regulations regarding Environmental Assessment
and effluent discharges including 1997 Collection of Environmental Protection Laws
and Regulations.
Waste Disposal
4.3.34 Whilst there are regulations prepared by the DOE which deal generally with the
prevention of pollution to water courses. it is understood that specific regulations
guiding the disposal of solid wastes. such as sludge, or the design, maintenance, arld
operation of "sacrificial" land or landfills are being developed.
Agriculture
4.3.35 DOE's standard for effluent use of irrigation and discharge to underground water has
been adapted in the design of the project.
Planning and Development - Urban Master Plan
4.3.36 The development plan framework for the city of Tehran is currentlv provided by the
Urban Master Plan which was approved in 1970. This plan sets out a plan for the
development of the city for the 25 year period from 1966 to 1992.
4.3.37 The development of the City was planned in a series of 5 year phases, each one
extending the boundaries of the city. Owing to topographical constraints, expansion of
the city was directed westwards. Areas were zoned for residential, commercial, and
industrial development. The latter largely on the western side of the City.
59



4.3.38 The Urban Master Plan was overtaken by events. with population growth exceeding
the original planning assumptions. ULncontrolled growth in residential and industrial
type developments has wvorsened the environmental and health problems created by
the inadequate seNvage disposal system in the city.
4.3.39 Alternative development proposals for the city have been considered including the
creation of entirely new urban centers west of the River Kan in order to create a
second local point for development and thereby. relieve pressure on Tehran.
4.3.40 DOE approval of the site for STP in October 1988 and based on their requirement of
500 meter no construction zone around it. Ministry of State and the Municipality of
Tehran besides specifying that the site is located in allocated green belt of Tehran,
advised that no construction permits will be provided in 500 meter radius of STP
(March 1989).
Deceniralization of Industry
4.3.41  It is estimated that 45 percent of all industrial development in Iran is located within
the Tehran Province owing to the availability of markets and good infrastructure.
Much of this development has taken place in an uncontrolled manner within the city
area and has resulted in considerable pollution to jubes and canals.
4.3.42 According to the DOE. there are 23 types of industrial activity within the city which
cannot meet current DOE effluent discharge standards. In conjunction with the
Ministries of Industry, and Ministry of Housing and Urbanization, a program to
relocate industry from specific areas of the city to designated zones outside of the city
boundary has been undertaken.
4.3.43 The program is understood to be underway with priority being given to relocating
leather and soap manufacturing industries located in Regions 15 and 16 which are to
be relocated on the Charmsar Industrial Estate area to the south of Varamin. Other
industries are to be relocated graduallv.
4.3.44 These industrial areas are to include appropriate effluent treatment facilities. In these
areas, waste discharges can be more closely monitored, and the relocation of industry
should result in an improvement in the level of heavy metal contamination in the
Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar Canals.
Protection of Species and Habitats
4.3.45 Under the Game and Fish Act 1970, hunting and fishing in any formn is subject to the
purchase of a license from the game and fisheries central office in Tehran. These
regulations limit the time and seasons for hunting and place restrictions on equipment
which may be used. The regulations prohibit the hunting and shooting in wildlife
parks. protected regions and nature reserves, unless special licenses are obtained.
60



.Vatural Parks and Protected Areas
43.46  The 1975 Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act renamed the Wild Life
Parks established by the Game and Fish Act as National Parks. and introduced the
concept of Protected Areas. which mav be:
* National Monuments: or
Wildlife Refuges.
4.3.47 Following the implementation of the new environmental protection law, many of the
present protected areas will be reclassified and a number of these are expected to
achieve National Park status. At present there are eight National Parks, forty-six
protected regions and fifteen protected rivers in Iran. covering a total area of
approximatelv 7.6 million hectares. Drawing EA/16 shows the location of these
reserves. numbered in the order in which they were established.
4.3.48 The tremendous potential of these protected areas for tourism and recreation is now
also receiving recognition and it is expected that adequate budgetarv allocations will
be made in the course of the current five vear development plan to tap this great
potential.
Endangered Species
4.3.49 Wildlife regulations have been introduced by the DOE to protect endangered species,
such as Persian fallow deer, Caspian tiger, bear. cheetah. crocodile, great bustard, and
Caucasian black grouse.
Archaeological and Cultural Heritage
4.3.50 Responsibility for archeology and cultural heritage rests with the Cultural Heritage
Organization and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. It is not known

5.0          POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
5.1          Impacts on the Geographical Entvironment
Changes of Lanid Use
5.1.1  Change of land use is a permanent affect which can be considered as a "one-time"
impact which occurs at the construction phase. There is no component of the project
that will require anv change of land use. as the sewers and STP will not require any
additional land and the canal from the STP site to Varamin is already complete. The
area of land required for Stage I of the activated sludge works was acquired by
TRWB before 1991 and enclosed with a 3 m high wall. The land within the wall is
currentlv dereiict but the adjoining land is cultivated. growing market garden produce,
except to the southeast. where there are derelict brick-works. Both these land uses are
compatible with the STP and no change of land use is therefore, envisaged.
Relocation of Population
5.1.2  The project will not require relocation of people or demolition of any properties.
Approximately. 10 families live within 500 m of the periphery of the STP site. These
are farrmers working on the adjacent land and probably will not require relocating as
the perimeter wall will screen them against noise. It is possible, however, that this
screening will not be effective against odors. Hence, scrubbers will be provided on
vents at STP.
Disturbance During Construction
5.1.3  These impacts will occur during the construction of the sewers and STP butwill only
be short term and affect different people at different times. Laying of the Westem
Main Sewer. interceptor sewers and house connections wvill cause the following
negative impacts:
*  restriction on access to buildings;
*  noise due to trench excavation:
*  possible effect of vibration on old and sensitive buildings;
*  closure of roads and section of roads. causing increased traffic
* congestion, longer journey times and diversions for pedestrians;
*  dust from construction activities: and
*  movement of construction traffic.
For residents of streets where sewers are being laid, these impacts will be felt but only
for a short period. Impacts will also be moderate for people using or passing through
the affected areas.
5.1.4  These negative impacts should bc considered against the permanent positive impact of
greatly increased amenity to the streets of Tehran and Shahr-e-Rey, an ancient city
which has considerable tourist potential. Additionally, after the sewers have been
connected. sewage wells can be filled in and no further sewage wells will need to be
62



dug, preventing further damage to foundations of buildings under threat by probable
earthquakes.
. 1.5  The Eastern Main Sewer is to be constructed in tunnel to avoid traffic disruptio)n
which would be caused by the cut and cover method of construction. The impacts of
this sewver xvill therefore be restricted to the tunnel shaft sites. About 54 shaft sites are
planned along the sewer route. The impacts at the shaft sites wiil be:
*  severe disruption to vehicular and pedestrian traffic due to occupation of part i)f
the carriage-wav and pavement at each shaft site,
* noise and vibration from operation of drilling equipment:
* dust and visual impact from piles of spoil near to shafts: and
* noise impact of heavv goods vehicles (HGVs) removing tunneling spoil.
5.1.6  When planning of the sewerage scheme is further advanced. a detailed study of shaft
sites will be required. in order for mitigative measures to be incorporated into the
construction plan. A detailed survev of other underground installations will be
required to enable the depth and route of the tunnel to be finalized.
5.1.7  Construction of the Southem  STP will cause verv little disruption. Access for
construction traffic xvill be via the Gas Access Road. which connects to the main
Tehran to Varamin highway to the northeast. Apart from a small settlement at the
junction with the main highway, there are only isolated farm properties served by the
road. The Gas Access road serves other industrial purposes and is of reasonable
standard. The impact of heavy construction traffic will therefore, be minimal.
Noise and Vibration
5.1.8  Potential noise impacts exist during construction and operational phases.  When
operational, the only noise source will be the STP. mainly from pumping equipmerkt.
Approximately 10 isolated farm properties are located within 500 m of the site. These
will experience an insignificant increase in noise levels during construction anld
operation. Since a 3 m high boundary wall surrounds the site and will be retained, the
screening achieved will reduce noise impacts to acceptable levels.
5.1.9  Construction noise impacts will be of two principal types: noise from construction
plant. and traffic noise from vehicles carrving construction materials and spoil.
Excavation of roads to lay sewers will have significant noise impacts on pedestrianas
and residents of properties adjacent to the sewer routes. The phasing of sewer
construction will ensure that noise impacts in each location are only for a short period
of time and will be limited to normal daytime working hours. No construction will take
place on Holy Days. Noise impacts, although temporary, will have be mitigated using
standard silencing equipment. Internationally recognized regulations limiting noise will
be included in the specifications of all contract documents for construction works aiid
supply of mechanical and electrical equipment.
5.1.10  Drilling and mechanical digging of road surfaces can produce vibration levels which
could potentially cause structural damage to foundations of old buildings, especially if
they have already been weakened by earthquake activity. 'This impact is likely to be of
63



some si_nificance in Shahr-e-Rev. the ancient city to the south of Tehran and directly
north of the STP. Much construction related ground-borne vibration will be alleviated
bv the use of bored rather than percussive drilling techniques and the use of dead-
Weight rather than vibratory compaction plant.
.1.11 Construction materials for the sewvers and STP will be transported bv road. The
sewerage is estimated to require 120.000 tons of concrete pipes per year: Stage I of
the STP (included in the project) requires 300.000 m3 of concrete and 30,000 tons of
steel. A considerable number of heavy vehicle movements will take place between the
construction sites and various concrete factories throughout the citv and the pipe
sources. Spoil transport will also increase vehicle movement to 15 trips to the
municipality disposal site in the desert south of the citv. This traffic will be spread
evenly. however. over the construction period and. given the present high traffic noise
levels and congestion. will not result in a significant increase in noise levels.
Odor
5.1.12 One of the main public concerns regarding sew'age treatment plants is the potential
problem of unpleasant odors. Odors from STPs are inevitable although their impact
can be minimized by:
e location of STP away from residential areas;
* installation of odor control equipment at the completed facilitv; and
* careful planning and implementation of plant operation and maintenance
to prevent formation and liberation of odorous substances.
Under normal operation of the plant, no significant odor problems should arise. If
sewage for any reason becomes septic, or raw sludge is stored for long periods of time
due to sludge treatment plant failure, odor problems will probably result. The plant has
been designed so that exposure of raw sludge to the atmosphere will be minimized by:
*  continuous withdrauval of sludge from the 6 thickening tanks:
* transfer of raw sludge to primary digesters by enclosed pipelines;
* anaerobic primary digestion in sealed tanks: and
* using scrubbers before venting the collected gases from the sealed tanks.
5. 1.13 It is inevitable that in the summer months. odors will increase. Provided that the plant
is operated and maintained properly, these will be neither severe nor frequent. The
prevailing wind direction is north to north westerly, so anv odors arising willtend to
be blown away from residential areas, and only a small number of isolated farming
properties to the south of the site may be affected. The nearest village to the south is
Ghoch Hessar, 1.5 km away, where only a slight odor may be discemible and only
under extreme conditions. The overall effect of the project will be a long term
reduction in odor problems through the provision of a sewerage system. Treatment of
sludge for agricultural reuse should put an end to the current practice of removing
sludge from Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals into unauthorized settling ponds.
These are uncovered, uncontrolled and give rise to significant odors at present,
particularly during the summer. After implementation of the project and removal of
sewage from the canals, it is probable that this practice will stop.
64



5. 1. 14 There is an additional. albeit remote. possibility of odor problems due to an accidental
release of chlorine gas. The health risk- of such an incident is. however, more
important and is discussed in Section 5.7.
Visual Inpact
5.1.15 Although. bv its nature. construction of the sewers and STP will cause a reduction in
visual amenitv in some areas. these impacts will be short term and only be cof
significance close to parks and attractive or historical areas.
5.1.16 The onlv permanent visual impact will be that of the completed STP at Shahr-e-Rey,
The lavout of the Stage I development at the site is shown in Drawing EA112. The site
is enclosed bv a 3 m high brick wall which. due to the flat. barren nature of the
surroundings, is visible from a distance awav. The color of the bricks is similar to the
surrounding ground. however, and the wall is not therefore visually intrusive. There is
some screening bv trees around the north end of the site. The presence of several
visual detractors (overhead pylons. disused gasworks) means that at present. the area
is of low aesthetic qualitv.
5.1.17 The tallest structures will be concentrated at the extreme western edge of the site and
comprise of:
* 12 primary sludge digesters 23 m high and 15 m in diameter.
* 6 secondary sludge digesters 16 m high and 20 m in diameter.
5.1 .18 These structures will be concentrated in a small area 260 m by 115 m.
5.1.19 Although these structures will be visible from a considerable distance, the STP wil[l
have no significant negative visual impact because:
*  the development will not reduce the visual qualitv of the site further;
*  apart from a few isolated properties. no residential areas have a view of
*  the site; and
*  the development will allow visual improvements to be made, such as
planting of trees around the perimeter wall.
Impacts on Traffic and Transportation
5.1.20 There will be impacts on traffic flow and the transportation network of Tehran frorn
the following activities:
*  closure and diversion of roads during sewer construction;
*  traffic used to transport raw materials and spoil during construction of
sewers and STP;
*  transport of sludge from STP to Varamin Plain; and
*  transportation effects as a result of associated developments.
65



5.1.21  Tehran alreadv suffers chronic road congestion at peak hours. This will be partially
reduced bv the opening of the Metro system. parts of which will be in operation when
sewer construction commences. The reduced Xwidth of roads during construction and
the closure and diversion of roads will lead to additional delays and congestion.
However. these impacts will be temporarv. When the sewerage netvork is complete.
the reduced incidence of flooding should result in a positive long tern impact on
traffic flows.
5.1.22 All construction materials and spoil will be transported bv road. The volumes of pipes,
concrete and spoil involved will require over 100 Heavv load vehicle'(HLV) trips per
day. This will have a slight impact on traffic flows but will be insignificant given
existing congestion. Where possible. all lorries will be directed away from the city
center and residential areas.
5.1.23 Access to the STP site will be made via the Gas Access Road from the Tehran
Varamin highwav. Current traffic flows in this area are low.
5.1.24 Treated sludge will be transported from the STP to the Varamin Plain by road. The
projected flows generated will be 26 lorrv trips per day along the main
Tehran-Varamin highwav. This level of traffic will have minimal impact.
5.1.25 Construction of the sewer network in Tehran will be carried out to ensure there are no
adverse effects on the Metro system. The Westem Main Sewer along Vali-ye-Assr
Street will follow Metro Line Number 3, passing 11 stations. The Eastern Main
Sewer, to be built by tunneling, will cross Lines 3. 2 and 4. The location of these
sewers will avoid any above or below ground structures associated with the Metro.
The Western Main Sewer will be laid on the opposite side of Vali-ye-Assr Street
avoiding the Metro works, and the eastern trunk sewer will be in a tunnel aligned to
run below. and hence, avoid the Metro lines.
5.1.26 Since the interceptor sewers and house connections will be constructed  at
comparatively shallow depths. they will also avoid the Metro svstem.
5.2          Impacts on the Social and Economic environment
Impacts on Population
5.2.1  The area of Tehran where population growth is currently fastest, the southern regions,
will be directly served by the project. The Iranian government is currently backing
family planning and the Ministry of Health has allocated 5 billion Rials annually for
birth control. The target population  growth  is below  2.9%.   The predicted
improvements in health and reductions in infant mortality as a result of the project,
may make people more willing to accept the birth control program. The reduction in
disease rates may, however, reduce mortality rates. In conclusion, therefore, it is
impossible to predict with any degree of confidence what effect the project will have
on population levels. However, with the reduction in illness associated with improper
management of sewage, the life expectancy will increase
66



lim7pacts on? EmploYment an1d Iticomne Distribuition1
5.2.2  It is estimated that the project will emplov 400 people in management. operation and
maintenance of the sewerace network, STP. and effluent & sludge re-use projects. Tile
positions will be permanent and others vill be created to cover environmental
monitoring. The number of construction jobs to be created will not be known until the
construction program has been finalized but w,ill almost certainlv be several thousand.
The project has also been designed to increase the agricultural productivity of the
Varamin Plain. with a consequence. large increase in rural employment.
5.2.3  The project therefore will have a positive and substantial impact on employment. Tllhe
staffing requirements will be for a combination of skilled and unskilled workers. It is
believed that much construction work and agricultural laboring is currentlv done by
Afghan refugees. This opportunity is likely to be extended by the project.
5.2.4 It is impossible to assess whether the project wouid have anv effects on income
distribution. although in the short term. it is unlikelv.
Impacts on the Economtv
5.2.5  The latest estimates of the cost of the different components of the project arepresented
below in Table 5.1. The total cost at 1999 prices. spread over the 5 years construction
period. will be in the region of $337 million.
67

Total project cost (Stage 1)        611.080                        307
5.2.6  In addition to the capital cost of constructing the project. certain recurrent costs will
be incurred to run and maintain the plant. These have been estimated as 14 million
Rials over an operational period of 23 vears. The project will. however. bring in
revenue from the sale of sludge and effluent to farmers and anv charges which are
made for provision of sewerage and sewape treatment. estimated as I million Rials
over 23 years.
5.2.7   The net present value (NPV) of the construction project has been estimated using the
assumption that the Tehran Sewerage Company will only be able to sell treated
effluent and sludge at the low prices currently obtainable for these products. The
project. however, may enable the TSC to review its tariff and charging policy and, in
the longer term, significantly increase household connections which may enable some
cost recovery on the STP to be made. This aspect needs further consideration in
connection with the financial and organization plans for the TSC. The net present
value of the project is estimated as a cost of 592 billion Rials, including recurrent cost
and revenue but excluding price contingency benefits. A discount rate of 8% has been
used.
5.2.8   This purely commercial consideration of costs and returns does not properly evaluate
the project impacts in terms of the benefits to the communitv as a whole, which can be
considered as the NPV of the "do-nothing" described in Section 6.1. That gives the
"do-nothing" NPV of [xxx] billion Rials. It should be noted that this does not include
many intangible environmental benefits.
5.2.9   Another possible but unquantifiable economic impact of the project, is the consequent
effect on the construction industry in Iran. The scale of the engineering work involved
will engage a significant proportion of the country's construction capacity. This may
have the effect of increasing prices for manpower and materials.
Urban Development
5.2.10 The provision of a sewerage system for the city will remove a major constraint on
urban development. It is likely that further development will take place in all areas
served bv the new network. This development will produce positive economic impacts
in terms of construction activity and employment. However, unless this development
68



takes place within a properly planned framework. it is possible that the sewerage
sNstem could bc overvhelmed.
5.3.          Impacts on the Cultural Environment
Ihnpacts on Historical and Cultural Siles
5.3.1   Historical and cultural sites are potentiallv affected by three types of impact:
-destruction or demolition:
-vibration and settlement as a result of construction activities. including
tunneling; and
-effect on amenity value of the site.
The project will not require the demolition of anv historical or cultural buildings, nor
will directly affect anv known archaeological sites. The sewers have been carefullv
aligned awav from the manv historical monuments in Shahr-e-Rev.
5.3.2  During construction. there are potential indirect effects on historical sites in Tehrain
city due to vibration from drilling and compacting equipment: and loss of amenity due
to dust. noise and visual intrusion. Good construction practices, including those
described in Section 5.1. should mitigate the effects of vibration. settlement, and dust.
Some loss of amenity to historical buildings is, however- unavoidable. Three mosque s
and a mausoleum are situated adjacent to the Western Main Sewer route. Given the
temporary nature of this impact, it is considered acceptable.
5.3.3   During the extensive excavation of the city's streets it is possible that archaeological
remains may be discovered, although finds are only. likely in the ancient city of
Shahr-e-Rey. The Cultural Heritage Organization is the designated authority and will
be consulted in all matters relating to archaeological sites & remains. Thie
specifications-of all the contract documents will include the requirement for reference
to this organization.
5.3.4  The long term permanent impact of the project on the cultural environment willbe,
positive due to the reduced incidence of flooding, improved amenitv, and aesthetic
rnialinr nf the citx \which chnild nvteich an-v temnnrqrTrv neaat\x'e imnactq
Impacts on Public Attitudes
5.3.5   An assessment has been made of possible conflicts of the project with social attitudes
or customs. Two issues were identified as potential problems:
-attitudes of farmers towards using human waste products for agriculture; and
-public attitudes towards a new system of sewage disposal.
5.3.6   Because of the current shortage of irrigation water. it is reported that farmers on the
Vararnin Plain are eager to obtain supplies of treated sewage effluent. This suggests
that there are no social objection to the use of sewage-derived products. The current
69



widespread unofficial agricultural use of sludge from Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar
canals \ould appear to confirm this. For the effluent and sludge re-use programs to
function w-ell. there is a need for enhanced education of the farmers involved.
5.3.7 No problems are envisaged concerning the willingness of the citizens of Tehran and
Shahr-e-Rey for their environs to be sewered. Piped sewerage and sewage treatment
svstems have alreadv been installed in some small areas of the city and no conflict in
social attitudes encountered. There is. however. a potential reluctance of people to
have their dwellings connected to their sewerage svstem. especially where there are no
immediatelv apparent problems with the existing sewage well system. This should be
overcome bv a clear and comprehensive publicity and awareness-raising program to
inforn people of the benefits of the project.
5.4          Impacts on Surface Waters
5.4.1  It is expected that the widespread provision of sewerage and sewage treatment in
Tehran will result in improvements in surface water qualitv with consequential health
benefits. as it has done in other cities. but such predictions are difficult to quantify at
this stage and will depend on the effectiveness of project implementation.
Impacts of Sewer Connections
5.4.2  The connection of premises to sewers instead of sewage wells will lessen the problems
of building damage due to water logging, flooding and overflowing of sewage into
jubes. qanats and eventually canals. The extent of this will depend on the rate of
connection of domestic and industrial premises to the sewer system and the ability of
the authorities to enforce such connections.
Jubes. Qanats, the Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar Canals
5.4.3  These can be expected to contain lower quantities of pathogens, organic matter and
heavy metals. The project will significantly reduce the health hazards posed by the
surface waters within the city, along with visual and odor nuisances. Canal flows can
be expected to fall as flows are diverted to sewers.
5.4.4  The current unofficial practices of using canal waters and sludges in agriculture on the
..... 1 -1       -                 I'l   ",-\s."-,   svatss r - ._   ,*1    -      .1.  11    ...,puv,
these practices cannot be safe unless the quality of surface waters is monitored and use
accordingly, controlled. Otherwise these practices will continue to pose a health
hazard and should be discouraged.
Impacts Relating to Industrial Discharges
5.4.5  The DOE has undertaken a programme of monitoring industrial discharges to surface
waters. The relocation of industries outside Tehran has also resulted in some
improvement.
70



5.4.6  It should be emphasized that the relocation policy will onlv transfer pollution problems
to sites outside the city rather than solve them. unless adequate treatment of these
industrial wastewaters is undertaken.
Impacts of Other Sewage Treatment Plantts in Tehran
5.4.7   All the STPs in Tehran are expected to function with lower influent and their
performance is expected to improve. This will reduce the contamination in dischargezs
to the Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals..
Impacts on River Water Qualitv
5.4.8  The project should affect improvements in the phvsicochemical and microbiological
quality of the Karaj and Jaj-e-Rud rivers downstream of Tehran. Health hazards posed
to downstream users such as desert nomads and local people south of Tehran should
be reduced. The project will not affect the qualitv of rivers which are used fcor
Tehran's water supplv.
Impacts on Water Szupply
5.4.9  The use of treated sewage effluent for irrigation of the Varamin Plain should reduce
the agricultural water demands on the Jaj-e-Rud river. This will allow the  abstraction
of larger quantities of river water for supply to the city, provided that the necessary
improvements in the water supply infrastructure can be made.
5.4.10 Reduction of the use of sewage wells should cause improvements in groundwater
quality (particularly the nitrogen content) within the city.
5.4.11 The two factors described above should ease Tehran's imminent problems of water
demand exceeding supply, but can only postpone these while total water consumptioln
continues to increase with population growth.
Impacts on Recreational Waters
5.4.12 The project is not expected to adversely affect the quality of recreational waters in
Tehran.
5.5    Impacts on the Hvdrogeological Environment
Impacts on Groundwater Movement Under the Tehran Plain
5.5.1   General groundwater movement and flows will not be affected by the proposed
project, except locally in the vicinity of the proposed trunk sewers. Where the sewers
are constructed beneath the existing water table. they may cause a local lowering of
the water table to the depth of the sewer. This depends in practice on the method cf
construction of the sewer. Since it is going to be sealed, no groundwater can enter it.
Hence, groundwater levels will not be affected. If the trench in which the sewer is laid
has a highly permeable fill placed around it. then the trench would act as a land drain,
though no water would enter the sewer. This would be interpreted as benefits in those
71



areas where the water table is too high. and causing building damage. Also. where
sewage wvells have become ineffective as a result of rising groundwater levels there
would be clear benefits if the water table were iowered. This is only likelv to occur.
however. adjacent to the line of the deeper sewers and where they would be beneath
the water table.
Impacts on Ground water Resources in Tehran
5.5.2 Groundwater resources are likelv to be reduced as a result of the connection of
substantial numbers of properties to the proposed sewers. This is not likely to cause
problems. however. because the groundwater resources in the more sensitive areas are
not widely utilized because of problems with its quality. Reference has already been
made to the substantial efforts on the part of TRWB to reduce the level of the water in
central and southern Tehran. There are 84 pumps operating at present to prevent the
water table rising even higher. The construction of the sewers. connections to them
and existing pumping to keep the water table from rising too far only affect the
shallow ievels of the aquifer. The deeper lavers would not be affected.
Ihnpacts on Groundwater Quzalitv in Tehran
5.5.3  The most significant impact of the project will be on the improvement of groundwater
qualitv as a result of the reduced quantitv of sewage discharged into the ground.
Similarly, the quality of the Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals is expected to
improve. These canals (and the jubes also) contribute poor quality water to the aquifer
where the water table is beneath their beds. When the quality of water in the canals
and jubes improves, then the quality of groundwater in the vicinity of them will also
improve. Similar arguments apply to the qanats. The quality of the water in the qanats
will improve as the quality of the general groundwater improves.
Impacts of the Reuse of Treated Effluent on the Varamin Plain
5.5.4  There are no known hvdrogeological reasons why the treated effluent should not be
suitable for both irrigation and groundwater recharge. Provided that the effluent meets
the proposed standards it.will pose no health risks. There are no anticipated quality
problems in recharging the aquifer, with the projected quantities.
-~~r-JS  D-'-''   &-Hv  -i*>***44w   @i-s I& *&   -1&11 UII UL
Varamin Plains. There is a major surplus. of groundwater in the Tehran Plain, and a
serious deficit in the Varamin Plain.
5.5.6 The existing recharge lagoons fed by the Jaj-e-Rud river, demonstrate that substantial
amounts of water can infiltrate through the lagoons into the aquifer. Treated effluent,
however behaves differently to river water, in that the former may give rise to both
physical and bacterial clogging, whereas the latter will cause mostly biological
clogging. The suspended solids content of the treated effluent is expected to be
considerably lower than that of the river water, so infiltration rates will not be reduced
as a result of physical clogging on the beds of the lagoons. Biological clogging of soil
in the lagoons will be eliminated by periodic scraping or scarifying of the ground
72



surface. as appropriate. It should be feasible to recharge the proposed quantities of
treated effluent into the aquifer.
5.6    Impacts on Agriculture
Impact on Crop Production
5.6.1   The project will have a beneficial effect on crop production bv ameliorating two of the
factors currentlv contributing to low vields. namelv:
providing an assured supply of a natural fertilizer in the form of treated
sewage sludge; and
reducing the incidence of seasonal water shortages.
5.6.2   There is the potential for the following additional measures to be taken in conjunction
with the project to further improve crop yields:
creation of an effective support service for farmers:
more effective weed control; and
use of modem high yield wheat varieties.
5.6.3  It is estimated that the improvements in crop yield of the Varamin Plain shown in
Table 5.2 will be achieved by the use of treated effluent and sludge from the Souther,n
STP. These are projections made by the FAO for full development of the Varamin
irrigation project over 18 years. It should be noted, as mentioned in 2.8, that sludgi e
will only be applied directly to cotton and cereal crops, but other crops will be rotated
with these and hence receive some advantage from the nutrient-rich soil.

5.6.4  The project therefore. if combined with the additional measures proposed above. will
have a significant positive impact on crop yields.
5.6.5  The total area of crop production will also be increased from 35.000 ha to 50,000 ha.
The cropping pattern of the full scheme is likelv to be very similar to the existing
situation. So the extended area for irrigation will give a 40% increase in production
of each crop.
lmnpact on Fertilizer Consumption
5.6.6  The three main nutrients required by crops are nitrogen. phosphorus. and potassium.
Potassium concentrations are usually very low in both treated sewage effluent and
sludge. The annual nitrogen and phosphorus contributions from the project have,
however. been estimated using the pilot study concentrations for treated effluent and
average UK values for sludge. The combined nutrient contribution of effluent and
sludge will be 96 kg nitrogen and 71 kg phosphorus per hectare. In practice the
available amounts of these nutrient will be lower, as nitrogen and phosphorus in
sludge tend to be less available to crops in the short term than in artificial  fertilizers.
The contribution is nonetheless substantial and equates in gross terms to an equivalent
of 1 1.000 tonnes of urea and 8,000 tonnes of triple super phosphate per year. It will,
therefore, be possible to reduce consumption of artificial fertilizers by similar
amounts, offering a significant financial saving.
Impact on Soil Qualitv
5.6.7  Sludge will add organic matter to the Varamin soils. This will have little effect    for
many years, however, given the proposed application rate. Current low levels of
nitrogen and phosphate will be raised by the use of sludge, and the effect of this on
soil quality will be positive.
5.6.8  In addition to nitrogen and phosphorus, treated effluent and sludge will supply many
of the trace elements required for crop growth. In the high pH soils of the    Varamin
Plain. limited contributions of zinc, iron, manganese and copper at acceptable levels
considered by FAO are likely to be beneficial.
5.6.9  Consideration of available analyses of effluent and sludge indicate that the use of

that the only likely problem with sludge may be high levels of cadmium. This has
been based on the analysis of six potentiallv toxic metals in sludge from the pilot
sewage treatment study.
5.6.10 In the absence of Iranian standards, EC limit values have been used to assess the
impact of applying treated sludge in the Varamin Plain. From the pilot plant study, the
concentrations of 6 potentially toxic metals in the treated sludge have been calculated,
assuming a 4:1 mix of primary and activated sludges. These are given in Table 5.3,
together with the EC limit values for heavv metal concentrations in sludge for
agricultural use. The higher limit values should be applied. given the alkaline nature
of Varamin Plain soils.

5.6.11  The onlv metal analyzed for in the pilot plant sludge which exceeded the EC limit
value was cadmium.  It should be noted however. that analysis for arsenic and
mercurn was not undertaken. The EC limit values for arsenic and mercurv in sludge
for agricultural use are 16 to 25 mg/kg drv weight. There is no EC limit value for
arsenic. although the UK Department of the Environment recoginizes it as a potentially
toxic element and have set a maximum permissible concentration in soil of 50 mg/kg
drv weight. It is strongly recommended that an analysis of mercurv and arsenic
concentrations in the sludge is undertaken before anv of it is applied to agricultural
land.
5.6.12 The EC Directive 8 sets two sets of limit values for heavv metal concentrations in
soils. neither of which should be exceeded. The first set refer to concentrations of
heavy metals in soils. the second to amounts of heavy metals which may be added
annually to agricultural land, based on a 10 year average. To use the first set to assess
the impact of the project requires existing concentrations of metals in Varamin soils
and the depth of soil into which the sludge would be mixed. Baseline data on heavy
metals is bein2 collected.
5.6.13 An estimation of the average annual application rate of each metal has been made and
compared to EC limit values in Table 5.4. These have been calculated from the
proposed application rate of 8 tons/ha of sludge (65% dry matter). The equivalent dry
solids application rate is 5.2 tons/hectare. The EC Directive requires that the average
annual dry sludge application over a 10 year period is used. For the Varamin scheme,
this has been calculated to be 1,560 kg/ha/year, assuming a maximum of three
application to each field over a 10 year period. From Table 5.4 it is apparent that the
EC limit for cadmium will be exceeded with twice the acceptable amount applied over
10 years. It is, therefore, essential that a monitoring program is initiated to record
levels of metals, especially cadmium, in the soils of the Varamin scheme area.
5.6.14 This assessment has been based, however. on the results of a single pilot plant study
carried out in 1990. The concentrations of metals obtained may not correspond with
those that will result from the completed STP. A full sludge monitoring program
should therefore, commence as soon as the STP becomes operational.
Impact on Crop Qualitv
5.6.15 The potential impact on crops of using treated effluent and sludge in agriculture is the
accumulation of heavy metals. This has implications for human and livestock nutrition
and can arise from crops taking up excessive amounts of certain elements that are toxic
to humans and livestock. The limit values for heavy metals in sludge and soils are
designed to ensure that concentrations in crops do not exceed safe levels.
5.6.16 It is difficult.at this stage to assess whether any elements are likely to accumulate in
crops at levels to exceed recommended limits. Projected heavy metal concentrations in
the sludge have been calculated from the results of the Pilot Plant Study, which did not
analyze for mercury, arsenic, selenium or fluorine. There is evidence that these
elements have adverse effects on livestock and humans when present in crops.

5.6.17 On the basis of the limited information presently available. the main concern regarding
the use of sludge is the possible accumulation of cadmium in crops. Cadmium is a
cumulative poison, affecting livestock and humans. In practice. however. with the
relocation of industry from Tehran and the high pH of the Varamin soils. cadmium
levels may not exceed limit values.
5.6.18 The impact on crop qualitv cannot therefore be assessed at this stage. Adverse impacts
can be prevented oniv by detailed monitoring of:
*     treated sludge after storage at the southern STP;
*     treated effluent;
*     soils at a number of locations throughout the agricultural area; and
*     the different crops grown.
impact on Livestock
5.6.19 There are two potential adverse impacts of the project on livestock namely:
*      impact of toxic materials from sludge applied to fodder crops; and
*      impact of toxic materials in treated effluent used for drinking water.
The former would only affect livestock within the Varamin area, whereas the latter
may affect any livestock feeding on crops grown on the Varamin Plain.
5.6.20 Research regarding the efficiency of metal removal by the conventional activated
sludge process in other countries indicates that, for most metals, removal is between
70% and 90% (zing, lead, cadmium, chromium, copper, aluminum and iron). For
nickel and cobalt, generally only 20% removal is achieved due to, their higher
solubilities.
5.6.21 A preliminary estimate of the likely effects of using treated effluent from, the STP as
drinking water for livestock has been made. The likely quality of the effluent has been
obtained from the analyses of the treated effluent from the pilot plant study using
wastewater from Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals. The concentrations are
10VIJP,1I_G LU I n  UpjjC  Li L  Z!,I I1 I ILU I _.. IL 'IIUU IU Ub; LIU LCU Li JUL * Wua  ac C.'LVsC4LU
to be worst case scenarios as the planned mitigation measures would ensure that the
concentration levels are much lower.
5.6.22 Of those analyses which were made, none exceeded FAO guideline limits. Several
important potential toxic materials were however omitted: arsenic,
fluorine,molybdenum, selenium, and mercury. The findings from the pilot plant show
that there is a possibility of lead and zinc approaching the upper limit levels. Since all
the effluent used will be diluted with other water sources, currently without high
metals contamination, it is unlikely that there will be any adverse impacts on livestock.
A monitoring program will be required however, to confirm this.

5.6.23 It is difficult to quantify the effect on livestock of sludge use in agriculture. Many of
the elements present in sludge are potentially toxic to livestock. namely cadmium,
lead. fluorine. molvbdenum, selenium, and mercury. These can enter the animals body
by consumption of vegetation in which elements have been absorbed and accumulated
or vegetation externallv contaminated with sludge.
5.6.24 Since sludge will only bc applied to cotton and cereal crops, a potential risk to
livestock couid arise where waste products from these crops are used as fodder.
Because sludge will be applied to the whole Varamin land area on a four year
rotation. however, livestock will be grazed on land to which sludge has been applied
in a previous year. Provided that the concentrations of toxic elements in the sludge,
soils and crops do not exceed limit values, there should be no adverse impacts on
livestock.
Impact on Agricultural Practices
5.6.25 The use of treated effluent as irrigation water will allow the expansion of the Varamin
scheme from 35,000 ha to 50,000 ha and the total crop production will increase. It is
likely that the proportion of different crops grown will not change greatly. The effect
of the project on stabilizing and increasing the supply of irrigation water to the area,
and to a lesser extent the nutrient benefits from sludge, may, however, lead to a
greater expansion in the areas of land given over to fruit, vegetables, and salads than
to other crops.
5.6.26 It may be necessary for the authorities to use regulatory or economic instruments  to
prevent a move towards higher production of cash crops at the expense of staple food
production.
Impact on Agricultural Workers
5.6.27 The WHO guidelines for sludge and effluent reuse in agriculture are designed to
prevent health risks to consumers of crops and agricultural workers.   Provided  that
these standards are met, there will be no adverse impacts on agricultural workers. The
methods by which effluent and sludge will be applied to the crops will be designed to
minimize human contact with sludge. Irrigation will continue to be by flood methods
and sludge will be ploughed into the soil immediately after application. If appropriate,

irrigation water to the Varamin scheme. This will have the following beneficial
effects:

*     crop yields per hectare should increase.

5.7   Impacts on Health
Improvements in Public Health
5.7.1  The current routes of infection for these waterborne diseases identified as being
important in Tehran are considered to be primarilv associated with the current pattern
of human excreta disposal and other related activities such as irrigation and direct
contact with contaminated waters.
5.7.2  It is evident therefore, that improvements in the ways in which sewage is collected,
treated and disposed of. will have a significant impact on the incidence of these water
related illnesses.
5:7.3  This route of transmission from man to water and back to man (with food an
important intermediate vector) will be broken. Nevertheless, the link between poor
standards of public health and inadequate mechanisms for the disposal of human
excreta is complex. It is difficult to ascribe or predict the health benefits arising from
a proposed improvement, such as the Tehran Sewerage Project. Complementarny
measures including good sanitation at the individual or family level, health education,
pest control and programmes of medication will be necessary if the potential health
benefits of the scheme are to be realized. The estimated expenditure on per annumi
basis on medication used to control parasitic illness in Tehran is 15 billion Rials
(1990/91). Medication alone will not have a sustained effect on the incidence of
helminthic illness, although programmes of mass chemotherapy may have a short
term effect. Long term reductions in rates of infection can only be achieved througi
concurrent improvements in sewage disposal and hygiene (at the domestic level).
5.7.4  It will be necessary to instigate a programme of mass chemotherapy when the scheme
is operational. This should commence at a time when worm burdens are the greatest
there is some evidence (from the Shahr-e-Rey survey) that this is in the month of
August. The program should be repeated at intervals of no greater than 60 days until
such time as monitoring shows that infective eggs are no longer found in the soil of
the agricultural areas. The economic effects of such a program are likely to be an
increase in the use of drugs such as Levamisole, Mebendazole and pyrantel amoate.
Over the longer tern, the use of anti-helminthic preparations is likely to decline
5.7.5  Other benefits are considered likely to accrue from implementation of the scheme. In
summary the principal benefits are considered to be those mentioned below.
*     Connection to an integrated sewerage system will significantly reduce the
amount of sewage disposed of to open watercourses which are used as a source
of irrigation water. In addition, direct contact activities (such as from any child
coming in contact with sewage) will also be considerably reduced with
corresponding reduction in the risk of disease transmission.
*     Prevention of groundwater contamination with nitrates and possibly micro
organisms (viruses) are considered to pose the greatest risk in this respect.
81



Adverse Impacts Due to Agricultural Use of Treated Effluent
5.7.6  Health impacts arising from the reuse of treated effluent have been a matter of
considerable concern and scrutiny in arid and semi-arid zones of the world. One result
of this has been the production of guidelines predicated on the imperative to protect
public health.  Most notable of these are the so-called Engelberg standards,
promulgated under the auspices of the WHO.
5.7.7  It is considered essential to maximizing the potential improvements to public health
arising from the project. Hence, the sewage treatment process is designed in such a
manner to ensure that it can be operated at all times for the treated effluent to meet the
WHO guidelines. These guidelines are based on epidemiological studies concerning
health impacts of excreta disposal and effluent reuse. At the present time, they provide
the most appropriate guidelines to underpin the design of sewage treatment processes
and effluent and sludge disposal options. The quality objectives applied to the treated
effluent (as described in the draft review of sewage treatment process alternatives) are
in accordance with the Engelberg standards.
5.7.8  In order to meet the criteria for eggs of intestinal nematodes or helminths (less than   I
per litre) and faecal coliforms (less than 1,000/1 00ml) the treatment process must be
designed in such a way that these criteria are consistently achieved. It is noted from the
aforementioned review of treatment options, that it is proposed to employ chlorination
in order to achieve the faecal coliforrn standard (the health aspects of chlorine are
discussed below). Chlorination will  be  required  throughout  the  year,  since
unauthorized use of treated effluent in the Tehran canal will probably be difficult to
prevent.
5.7.9  It is intended that nematode removal be achieved through the combined effects of
primary and secondary settlement within an essentially conventional activated  sludge
process followed by tertiary treatment (filtration). Tertiary treatment has been added
even though a mission to the area during May 1991 undertaken under the auspices of
IJNDP, recommended that:
*     rapid gravity filtration was not required since the results of studies conducted
elsewhere in Iran indicated that a conventional activated sludge process was
*     the chlorine contact tank was not necessary since the effluent conveyance
channel would effectively serve the same purpose.
5.7.10 The recommendation by the UNDP mission to dispense with tertiary filtration was
based on the results of analysis of intestinal nematode egg concentrations in raw
sewage and the resulting final effluents at the Shoosh and Saheb Gharanieh STPs in
Tehran. The raw sewages entering these STPs were found to contain intestinal
nematode eggs in the ranges 20 to 168 per litre and 15 to 366 per litre respectively,
although in the case of the Sabeb Gharanich STP the upper value of 366 per litre was
represented by a single sample whereas the remaining 95 samples exhibited a range of
15 to 79 per litre.
82



5.7.11 Evidence from operational activated sludge STPs (which incorporate secondary
settlement) is that the removal efficiency of intestinal nematode eggs is between 0 and
2 orders of magnitude . The final concentration of eggs is a function of the load
entering the works. Thus the final effluent numbers are a direct function of the raw
sewage levels. Consistent attainment of the WHO guideline level infers that the
concentration of nematode eggs in the raw sewage must not exceed 100 per liter given
that the treated sewage effluent may not be diluted with river water at all times (s, e
Section 2.5). Given that the activated sludge sewage treatment system has been
designed to produce a sludge of good settleabilitv and low upflow velocities in the
secondary sedimentation tanks, it is predicted that a removal efficiency of 2 orders of
magnitude (99%) will be achieved. However, to address the issue of high level (:f
nematode eggs (at concentration greater than 100 eggs per liter) and for consistenlt
performance, tertiary treatment system has been added to the process.
5.7.12 At present. the likely concentration of intestinal nematode eggs in the raw sewage to be
received by the new STP is variable. It is unclear whether the findings from the
Shoosh and Saheb Gharanieh STPs can be extrapolated to the catchment area due to be
served by the proposed plant. There may be differences in socio-economic status and
incidences of helminthic disease between these areas which result in dissimilar levels
of intestinal nematode eggs in sewage in these two areas compared with the catchment
area for the new STP.
5.7.13 Evidence from the literature provides some data concerning the range of
concentrations of intestinal nematode eggs n raw sewage. Raw sewage in Aleppo
(Syria) contained between 1,000 to 8,000 Ascaris eggs per liter. Studies in North-Eas;t
Brazil revealed that raw sewage contained 300 to 1,800 eggs of Ascaris and other
parasites per liter (hookworms 100 to 300 egg/1). The Syrian experience may be
considered the worst case scenario since the prevalence of the disease was reported to
be 42%, a figure comparable with that observed in Tehran in 1990 (the levels are
believed to be lower now). However, it is possible that per capita water consumption
was lower than that in Tehran. If this were to be the case, a degree of dilution must be
taken into account. thereby reducing the concentration of eggs in the proposed works
influent. There is a possibility that the influent intestinal nematode egg concentrations
will be in excess of 100 eggs per liter.
5.7.14 The effluent from the proposed sewage treatment plant should achieve the WHO
not exceed a mean value of 100 per liter. This view is based primarily on the published
scientific data relating to the performance of activated sludge plants in removing
nematode eggs and is consistent with findings of the UNDP mission to Tehran in May
1991. Only the data from the small STPs of Saheb Gharanieh and Shoosh in Tehran
exist to verify the assumption that the influent to the proposed works will in practice
contain less than 100 eggs per liter.
5.7.15 In order to ensure consistent performance of STP, satisfactory performance of the
tertiary treatment system should be ensured.

Adverse Impacts Due to Agricultural Use of Sewage Sludge
5.7.16 The WHO guideline for intestinal nematode eggs is less than I per 100 grammes dry
weight of excreta or sludge, which can be achieved by storage of sewage sludge for a
period of one year. The project incorporates this stage, hence, assuring compliance
with WHO guidance with respect to nematodes.
5.7.17 The zoonotic infections Anthrax and Brucella in cattle and goats have been reported as
being present in the country, although vaccination programs are in place. It would
therefore be prudent to assume that the causative organisms (Bacillus anthracis and
Brucella sp.; probably B. melitensis) will be present in the sewage to be treated.
Sources would include drainage from livestock handling areas, abattoirs, and
tanneries. Dilution by unaffected effluents would greatly reduce the concentration of
these organisms entering the treatment works. Storage of sludge for a period of a year
will effect a further reduction in the number of surviving organisms, although the
spores of Banthracis are particularly resistant.  Overall the risk of transmission
through the agricultural use of sewage sludge is considered slight. These will be
monitored and only when the levels are within the guidelines, will the sludge
application proceed.
5.7.18 Contamination of sludge with heavy metals or other toxicants has been considered. On
the basis of current evidence it would appear that the only contaminant of real health
concern is cadmium and appropriate mitigation and monitoring programs need to be in
place with effective implementation
Adverse Impacts Due to Chlorination
5.7.19 Two hazards have been identified arising from the proposed use of chlorine as a
disinfectant at the sewage treatment works.
5.7.20 Firstly, the transportation, storage, and use of liquid chlorine poses clearly identifiable
risks of human injury in the event of an acciden'tal release of gas. These risks can be
minimized by attention to the design of the chlorine storage and handling facilities at
the plant.  In conjunction, adequate means of ventilation, provision of safety
equipment, and a well defined emergency response procedure must be put in place.
international practice. Chlorine has been successfully and safely transported in Tehran
for about 40 years in connection with water treatment plants. No additional adverse
impact is therefore, envisaged.
5.7.21 The second issue concerns the formation of dis-infection byproducts as a result of
adding chlorine to sewage effluents. Chlorinated species such as trihalomethanes and
MX (3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(H)-furanone) have been demonstrated
in chlorinated sewage effluent. The health impacts arising from the chlorination of
sewage effluents are unclear. On balance, the risks to health from microorganisms in
an non disinfected effluent are almost certainly greater than those posed by disinfection
byproducts in a chlorinated effluent. However, as appropriate mitigation and
monitoring program needs to be in place and effectively implemented.
84



5.7.:  Notwvithstanding, all efforts should be made to minimize the amounts of disinfection
bvproducts formed by using the smallest dose of chlorine commensurate with
achieving the WHO standards for treated effluent.
5.7.23 The disinfection parameters necessar-v to achieve the WHO standards suggest that a
dose of 5 m/ I(based on literature) followed b' a contact time (after intimate mixing)
of not less that 30 minutes will be required . The residence time in the conveyance
channel is estimated at 10 hours (I m/s over 36 km). indicating that for the majority of
its length the contact period will be in excess of 30 minutes. On this basis. a contac:t
tank within the works appears superfluous. However. assuming limited storage on site
following chlorine addition. it is conceivable that for the first 1.8 km (i.e.. to provide a
resident time of 30 minutes) the faecal coiiform  levels will be in excess of those
required. If treated effluent were to be used for irrigation or. more importantly in terms
of health risks. children or others were to come into direct contact with the effluent in
this zone immediatelv downstream of the plant. health risks would ensue.
5.7.'4  It is considered appropriate that the configuration of the plant is such that the minimur
contact period of 30 minutes is achieved either within the boundarv of the works or in a
secure area where people are denied access to the treated effluent stream.
Adverse Inmpacts Due to Operation of the Sewage Treatmeni Plant
5.7.25 As mentioned previously, the review  of treatment processes has identified a
conventional activated sludge process as being appropriate. One issue of concern
regarding the operation of activated sludge plants is that of aerosol production and the
resultant public health impacts. Studies on the health impact of wastewater facilitie;
on surrounding populations have been inconclusive in determining whether increased
reporting rates of illness were significantly associated with proximity to the plant or
due to socio-economic factors.
5.7.26 A number of studies have been carried out to determine levels of airborne indicator
and enteric organisms around wastewater facilities or sludge handling plants. In
general, the majority of these studies demonstrated elevated levels compared with
control sites. However, the lethal effects of dehydration, especially in combinatior
with the presence of sunlight, limit the distance at which effects can be observed. A.
study of the distribution of heterotrophic bacteria, faecal indicators, and coliphages
(bacterial viruses) in the vicinity of an unenclosed activated wastewater sludge plani
observed that only heterotrophic bacteria remained at significantly higher than,
base-line densities beyond 250 m downwind from the center of the aeration tanks.
Furthermore, this study confirned similar observations that densities were higher  al:
night, presumably due to the lack of the killing action of sunlight.
5.7.27 Studies of treatment plant workers have produced no evidence to suggest that
exposure to sewage aerosols increase their risk of contracting an infectious disease.
5.7.28 It is reasonable to conclude therefore, that the operation of the sewage treatment plant
will not pose a risk to health of the operators or those who live or work in the
immediate area as the distance to the nearest farrn is more than 500m from the center
85



of the plant. and workers will follow- occupational health & safety practices in addition
to under2oincg medical surneillance.
.Adverse Impacts Duie to Grountdwvater Recharge
5.7.29 There are four water quality criteria which should be considered in any recharge
scheme usinM reclaimed water. These are:
*     pathogens:
*     total mineral content
*     heavy metals: and
*      stable organic substances.
5.7.30 The present consensus is that trace organic contaminants are perceived to be a greater
threat than the other three classes of contaminants.
5.7.31  In order to minimize the contamination of the treated effluent and sewage sludge with
toxic metals it will be necessarv to instigate a scheme of trade effluent control
(minimizing their discharge from sources such as industries) with the objective of
reducing the input of such substances to the sewerage svstem.
5.7.32 The health impacts of groundwater recharge with recycled water have been
investigated at a number of locations. Probably the most extensive study is that carried
out in Orange and Los Angeles Counties where recharge has been practiced since
1962. The proportion of reclaimed water in potable supplies ranged from 0 to 23%.
The results of the study suggested that the use of reclaimed water had no measurable
effect on groundwater quality or the health of people ingesting the water.
5.7.33 The lesser concem regarding possible microbiological contamination is due to the fact
that passage of water through soils is very effective in removing bacteria, parasites,
and viruses. Nevertheless. it will be important to ensure that the route where by treated
effluent enters the groundwater facilitates this purification phenomenon. Issues
requiring attention relate to:
*      the mode of application of treated effluent during irrigation;
*      the use of suitably designed and constructed infiltration basins for aquifer
recharge; and
*      the correct design and construction of structures such as sewers and tanks which
convey or store effluent which has not received full treatment, in such a way as to
prevent leakage direct to groundwater.
5.7.34 It is concluded that provided heavy metal contamination can be adequately controlled
at source, there will be no adverse health effects from the use of treated effluent for
aquifer recharge. The most stringent conditions would need to be applied in
circumstances where the recharged aquifer was being used as a source of water for
potable use. Such scenario would require (in addition to trade effluent controls)
monitoring of the treated sewage effluent and groundwater to determine levels of
heavv metals and other contaminants and. if necessary, modification of recharge rates.
The objective being to maintain the quality of groundwater commensurate with the
86



WHO Guidelines for drinking water for those parameters which are unaffected by
conventional water treatment practices (principally metals and non-volatile organic
substances).
Adverse Impacts Duie to Pests
5.7.35 Vermin act as vectors for human diseases. including salmonellosis (cockroaches),
malaria (mosquitoes). and leptospirosis (rodents).
5.7.36 It is considered that the project will have little impact on the prevalence of rodents and
cockroaches. Insects that enter the domestic environment mav promote disease
transmission bv moving faecal pathogens into houses and onto food. The actual
contribution to human disease via this route is unclear and the direct faecal-oral route
is the more probable major route of transmission.
5.7.3 7 The removal of human excreta from the immediate v'icinitv of domestic dwellings will
reduce the possibilitv that transmission of faecal pathogens directly to food may occLr.
The control of human excreta will not eliminate the risk completely since alternativ,e
breeding sites will exist. A program of insecticidal control will be required to control
the populations of flies and cockroaches. Preventing insects coming into contact with
human excreta should reduce the proportion of the populations which harbor pathogeris
exclusively of faecal origin (such as poliovirus. Hepatitis A, Shigella, Entamoeba
histocvlitica and the eggs of roundworrns and hook-worms).
5.7.38 It is quite probable that flies will breed in the sludge drying beds. Such flies are not
migratory, and since there will be sufficient food in the drying beds. they will not
usually spread further than 100 to 500 m from the breeding sites. Since there will only
be a small number of people working in the vicinity of the sludge drying beds and
hence. within, the range of these flies. they are not expected to pose a significant health
hazard.
;.8   Impacts on Climate
5.8.1  The impact of the project on regional and global climates will, almost certainly, be
negligible. Certain aspects of the scheme will though produce emissions of gases
which are believed to contribute to global warming. The treatment of sewage and
sludge at the STP will convert much of the organic matter in the sewage to methane
and carbon dioxide. It is estimated that 25.7 tonnes/day of methane and 38.l)
tonnes/day of carbon dioxide will be produced. At the STP, the methane produced will
be used as fuel to heat the digesters, converting it to carbon dioxide.
5.8.2  It should be recognized that this sewage currently decomposes anaerobically in sewage
wells through natural processes, producing similar quantities of methane and carbon
dioxide. Since methane has a contribution to global warming approximately 21 times
that of carbon dioxide on a molecule-for-molecule basis (one molecule of carbon is
converted to one molecule of carbon dioxide), burning of the methane can be
considered as reducing any contribution from the sewage of Tehran to global warming.
87



Conversion of the methane to carbon dioxide will result in total production of 108.7
tonnesidav of carbon dioxide.
5.8.3   However. the power consumed by the plant will be generated bv burning fossil fuels
which produce carbon dioxide. The average power consumption of the STP will be
7.77 MW (over 24 hour davs and seven dav weeks). The power will be supplied from
gas and oil-fired power stations in Tehran linked to the Iranian National Grid. The
power consumed wvill be only 0.30% of Tehran's current electricitv consumption
(2.572 GW). and 0.038% of Iran's electricitv consumption (20.7 GW). The emissions
produced bv the generation of this additional power will be negligible in comparison
with those alreadv produced.
5.8.4  The chemical processes involved in the production of cement for pipe manufacture
(20.000 tons per annum) will result in the production of 27.5 tons of carbon dioxide
per dav. The effect of these emissions cannot be quantified at this stage but will
probably be insigznificant in regional and global terms. The figures of carbon dioxide
should be put into context: the driving of 100.000 cars for 50 km per dav will produce
200 tonnes of carbon dioxide per dav (assuming an efficiencv of 20 niles per gallon).
5.8.5  Transport requirements of both construction and operational phases will produce
emissions of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. The quantities of
these will be small in comparison to those produced by the total vehicle usage in
Tehran.
5.8.6  At the STP site. sizeable bodies of water will bc exposed to the atmosphere and
evaporation will occur. The estimated evaporation rate from Stage I is 1000 m3/day,
0.25% of the influent flow. The sewage which will be transferred by the project to the
STP is currently exposed to the atmosphere as it flows along the jube and canal
network. There is unlikely therefore to be a sizable variation on current evaporation
rates and so relative humidity will be unaffected.
5.8.7  In conclusion, it is considered unlikely that the project will have any significant
adverse effects on the local, regional or global climates.
5.9   Impacts on the Biological Environment
Impact on Habitats
5.9.1  The only part of the project which will cause a permanent loss of habitat is the STP at
Shahr-e-Rey. The land required for Stage I has already been acquired by TRWB and
enclosed by a 3 m high wall. The site is currently barren and has little vegetation of
any type. Although an ecological assessment of the site has not been made, there is
almost certainly no flora or fauna of any value present.
5.9.2  Construction of the STP at this site provides considerable opportunity for ecological
enhancement of the vicinity. Consideration should be given to the planting of trees and
shrubs around the site perimeter to provide visual & noise screening, and a new
88



habitat. The overall long term effect of the STP on the local flora and fauna could
therefore. be positive.
Impact on protected species and habitats
5.9.3  No protected species have been recorded in the areas directlv affected by the project.
The project is likely. however, to have an indirect positive long-term  effect on the
Kavir Protected Area to the south of the Varamin irrigation scheme. The wastewaters
of Tehran eventuallv reach the Band Alikhan River (the major river of the Kavir
Protected Area). an important habitat for wvaterfowl and wvaders. Although the furLire
qualitv of this river depends on many factors. it is likely that the provision of sewerage
in Tehran. and consequent reduction in wastewvater discharges to Sorkhe Hessar and
Firouzabad canals. wvill lead to an improvement in the long term. The impact ofl:he
project. therefore. on the Kavir Protected Area will probablv be positive in the long
term.
Disturbance to Fauna
5.9.4  There is some evidence wvhich suggests that certain construction activities can have
adverse effects on animals in the vicinity of the works. The possible disturbance effects
of constructing the STP have been considered. Since the immediate area is almost
devoid of animal life and subject to previous industrial activity (gasworks and oil
refinery), it is unlikely that there will be any disturbance as a result of constructing tlhe
works. While in operation., the plant will result in a slightly higher ambient noise level
around the site, but experience suggests that birds and other animals adapt to this and
suffer no adverse effects.
Indirect ecological effects due to improvements in surface water quality
5.9.4  Implementation of the project is predicted to lead to improvements in surface water
quality for Firouzaba and Sorkhe Hessar canals and the rivers to which thev discharge.
The ecologJical consequences of this are uncertain at this stage. but likely to be
positive.
5.10   Impacts on Other Planned Developments
Impact on program of industrial relocation
5.10.1 The project will have no effect on the phased plan to relocate industries from Tehran 'to
6 locations to the south of the city. The two projects, in conjunction however, will
improve the environment of Tehran.
Impact on Green SpaceProvision
5.10.2 There is potential for increasing the amount of green space around Tehran as a result of
the project. Since the quality of surface waters will be improved there is clearly scope
for creating new parks and green corridors adjacent to rivers and canals in the city.
89



fInpact on Program of Improvenment to Services
5.10.3 The sewerage and sewage treatment of Tehran is an integral part of the strategic
improvement of the city's services. It should have a positive effect on the other
components due to the improvement in amenitv and reduction in surface water pollution
in the citv. Construction of sewers and tunneiing wvi1 be designed and phased so as not
to interfere with the Metro in anv wav. It is possible. however. that future extensions to
the Metro netnvork will be somewhat constrained bv the locations of the two Main
Sewers.
Inpact on? Water Supply Schemes
5.10.4 It is anticipated that construction of the Taleghan Dam will go ahead given the
increasing demand for electricitv and potable water in Tehran. Further proposals may be
deferred. however. if the use of treated effluent reduces future agricultural water
demands on the Jaj-e-Rud river.
Impaci on Other Sewage Treatment Plants
5.10.5 The STPs currently under construction. at Gisha and Shahrak-e-Ghods will be
completed as planned. Construction of the South-Western STP will commence
following the completion of the project.
5.11   Summary of Environmental Impacts
5.11.1 The likely direct and indirect environmental impacts of the project are summarized in
Table 5.6. The impacts are those predicted providing that suitable mitigative measures
are implemented. Although there are a nurnber of negative impacts predicted, no
severe negative impacts are considered likely in the long tern. In many cases,
predictions cannot be easily made and the implementation, monitoring and
effectiveness of mitigative measures will determine the significance of many impacts.
The major environmental issues are: (a) the impacts of effluent and sludge from their
reuse in agriculture and reinjection of surplus water into groundwater aquifer; and (b)
the release of toxics (including metals such as cadmium) through industrial
discharges. The impacts could be significant without appropriate mitigation measures
but not greater than the baseline. The quality of data available will be validated
during project implementation.

Major Adverse Impacts of the Project
Effluent Quzaliny
The effluent should be of acceptable qualitv so that it can be used in agriculture and surplus
if any. recharged into groundwater. This means that the effluent qualitv should meet WHO
quality 2uidelines for use in agriculture and drinking Xvater quality for recharging to ground
water. One of the major parameter of concern is the level of nematodes which should be less
than I egg per liter for water used in agriculture.
Sludge WVater
There is a possibilitv. given the proposed sludge use application rate and without the planned
mitigation measures. that the limit values for cadmium in sludge used in agriculture could be
exceeded. Based on the on_oing relocation of industries and the control of industrial
discharges to the sewer svstem. the levels for toxics (including heavv metals such as
cadmium) is not expected to exceed the EU and FAO guidelines fort the use of sludge in
agriculture. Monitoring and assessment of heavy metals in sludge and soils is being
undertaken to ensure that limits are not exceeded and allow the formulation of an acceptable
sludge reuse strategy.
94



6.0    ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED PROJECT
6.1    Option 1: No Project
6.1.1  The "do nothinc' option is that of continuina with the status quoof using sewage wells
for sewage disposal. with no further construction of sewer networks. the Southern STP,
or South-wsestern STP. This Section compares this option with the proposed project.
Surface WVater Pollution
6.1.2  This option would essentiallv lead to a continuation of the current surface anld
groundwater problems described in Sections 3.4 and 3.5. The situation can be expected
to deteriorate as the population of Tehran (and particularlv the population density)
increases. The sewage well svstem is so dispersed across the city that it could bc much
more difficult to monitor and ensure levels of treatment. particularly of industrial
wastew. aters.
6. 1.3  Qanats. jubes and canals would continue to be polluted by overflowing sewage wells
and illicit discharges, and contain excessive quantities of pathogenic micro-organisms,
organic matter, solids and potentially toxic elements such as heavy metals. The illicit
uses of the Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canal wvaters and sludges on the Tehran Plain
would remain hazardous. resulting in the contamination of crops. It is unlikely that all
these practices could be controlled.
6.1.4  The program  of relocation of polluting industries outside Tehran will result in a
decrease in industrial wastewater flows within the city, but some will remain. In many
cases provision of on-site treatment wvould be difficult and failure to provide this
service would result in pollution of canals or groundwater.
Groundivater
6.1.5   Groundwater levels would continue to rise. causing increased building damage and
waterlogging. Avoidance of waterlogging would require greatly increased expenditure
on pumping to lower the water table and may not be feasible. Pollution of groundwater
would also continue to increase, particularly from ammonia and nitrate nitrogen. This
would either pose increased health hazards to consumers or reduce the quantities of
water available for drinking, public baths etc.
Agriculture
6.1.6  The lack of treated sewage effluent for re-use in irrigation of crops on the Varamin
Plain would result in lower crop yields than those predicted for the project. Expansion
of the Varamin irrigation area from 30.000 ha to 50.000 ha would not be possible. The
alternative would increase use of water from the Jaj-e-Rud. This is of good quality for
irrigation and there would be less likelihood of accumulation of toxic elements in crops
but this source is also abstracted for drinking water for the city. The use of untreated
waters from the canals or effluents from the existing STPs in Tehran for crop irrigationl
of the Varamin Plain could pose a health hazard and is not recommended. The lack of
sufficiently treated sludge would lead to higher requirements for fertilizers than
95



projected. The use of sludges from the canals or untreated sludges from the existing
STPs in Tehran on the Varamin Plain poses a health hazard to workers and consumers
and is. therefore. not recommended.
Health
6.1.7  Incidences of water-related diseases such as ascariasis and shi2ellosis in Tehran could
be expected to remain high or even increase as the population increases. The costs of
working davs lost and remedial drugs consumed would remain high.
Construction Imipacts
6.1.8  Not constructing the sewer network would a void manv of adverse construction
impacts associated with the project within the city (such as noise. disturbance, traffic
interruption, and dust). The Shahr-e-Rey STP site would be free for other uses and
those nearbv would not be subject to disturbance. noise. and odor impacts. The high
construction costs and concrete & steel requirements associated with both aspects
wvould be avoided.
6.1.9  However the regular and widespread construction of sewage wells would still be
necessary. This would cause localized disturbances and produce spoil which would
need to be disposed of. Though the STP site would not be needed for this option, a
greater area of land within the city itself would be required for sewage treatment. At
present sewage wells cover about 90 km2 of the city and limits of space may bc
reached in the more densely populated areas.
Economic Analysis
6.1.10 Table 6.1 shows the costs of continuing with present methods of sewage disposal and
not implementing the project. though many benefits and costs are difficult to quantify.
The period covered is 30 vears from commencement of the project with a discount
rate of 8%. It can be seen that the total net present cost of not implementing the
project, 567 billion Rials, is in fact very similar to that of implementation given in
Section 5.2, 592 billion Rials. Costs for the provision of sewage wells, medicines, and
working days lost would be paid directly bv individuals and indirectly by the
economy. It should be noted that many of the positive benefits from implementing the
project such as improved surface water quality and decreased competition for water
resources between public consumption and agriculture have not been included.
Conclusions
This option is rejected on the grounds of both economic cost and adverse
environmental impacts (on water resources, surface water quality, groundwater levels
and quality and health).

6.2    Sewage Treatment Using Waste Stabilization Ponds
6.2.1  The draft review of sewage treatment process alternatives considered the use of waste
stabilization ponds for " proposed project instead of the conventional activated sludge
process. Under this option. the construction of the sewer network, all activities within
the cirt. and the effluent and sludge reuse schemes would be same as for the proposed
project. Waste stabilization ponds are a series of shallowv earthen basins through
which sewagze flows without mechanical aeration or mixing. The ponds would be
used instead of the treatment plant at STP.
Svstem Design
6.2.2   A waste stabilization pond system designed for Stage I flows would consist of:
* an inlet works as for the proposed project:
* 12 anaerobic ponds 289 m bv 125 m by 4 m deep:
* 64 facultative ponds 595 m by 205 m bv 1.5 m deep:
64 maturation ponds 658 m by 95 m bv 1.5 m deep: and
* chlorination equipment as for the proposed project.
6.2.3  Sludge would be produced in the anaerobic ponds. These would be operated on a 4
year rotation, with 9 of these in operation at a time and 3 used for storing sludge for
one year. The anaerobic ponds would be lined with concrete to facilitate the removal
of sludge. The facultative and maturation ponds embankments would be protected
with concrete to prevent erosion due to wave action and to prevent the growth of
vegetation at water level. Sludge thickening and digestion equipment would not be
needed.
Proposed Site at Eshghabad
6.2.4  The total land area required for the above is about 1,545 hectares (3,750 m by 4,400
m). A further 2.200 hectares would be required for stage 2. The proposed Southerm
STP site at Shahr-e-Rey is inadequate for this. The site identified for waste
stabilization ponds is west of the village of Eshghabad. approximately 15 km south of
the Shahr-e-Rey site. This is the only suitable site which could be used without major
land acquisition probiems. It is 5 km from the Tehran-Garrnsar railway and 6.5 km
from the Tehran-Varamin highway. A newly formed tributary of the Sorkhe Hessar
canal forms the eastern boundary of the site, and near the southern boundary of the
site the Sorkhe Hessar canal is joined by the Firouzabad canal and a tributary of the
Jaj-e-Rud river. It is also probable that the Firouzabad canal crosses the site.
6.2.5  The site forns part of a natural shallow basin, and comprises mainly of low grade
agricultural land. In some parts of this site, owing to the very shallow water table
(0.7 to 3 in below the surface), ponding has occurred at the surface together with the
deposition of salts in the surface soils. Little information is available on soils in this
area.
98



Pathogen Removal
6.2.6 Chlorination of the treated effluent wouid oniy bc required in March. April (possibly)l,
and November. reducing the amount of chlorine used. The pathogen standard would
be achieved bv the ponds themselves from Mayv to October.
6.2.7  The design criteria for waste stabilization ponds assume that the WHO standard of
less than one intestinal nematode egg per litre will be achieved. Evidence from
investigations of operational waste stabilization pond systems indicate that the
necessary degree of helminth removal will be achieved provided that the design
criteria are observed. The total retention time of the proposed svstem, 47.5 days, is;
sufficient for the removal of intestinal nematode eags without tertiarv treatment.
Additional Svstem Requirements
6.2.8  Sewagze wvould be transported from Shahr-e-Rey to the Eshghabad site via a 18 km
longz rectanguiar box culvert. Up to 8 m3/s of treated effluent would then have to be
pumped back up to the Tehran canal for transport to the Varamin Plain. This would
require a pumping station (against a head of about 130 m) and two 1.500 mm diameter
pipelines 20 km long for the Stage I flows. The Firouzabad canal may have to be
diverted around the site.
6.2.9  Due to the shallow groundwater table in the area it would be necessary to construct the
ponds entirely above ground, entailing a high earth-moving cost. A waste stabilization
pond system would not normally be constructed on a site with these ground conditions.
Power
6.2.10 The total installed power requirement for the entire Stage I works including the
effluent pumping station would be 20 MVA. Electricity would have to be brought from
20 km away by supply lines. Power consumption would be 77.524.000 KWh per
annum, higher than for the proposed project. There would be 2 diesel standby
generators: giving a total output of 2 MW to provide sufficient power for operation of
the essential plant and equipment during any mains power failures. Ninety per cent of
the power consumption would be for the pumping of treated effluent back up to the
irrigation area.
Evaporation and Seepage from Waste Stabilization Ponds
6.2.11 The total surface area of water across the site envisaged in the Stage I design is over
1,200 hectares, so a considerable quantity of water could be lost by evaporation.
Taking rainfall into account, it is predicted that 22 Mm3 of water would be lost each
year (a mean of 60,786 m3/d or 15.2% of the total flow). Perhaps more seriously, the
predicted mean daily water loss during the month of peak irrigation water requirement.,
June, is 118,570 m'/d, or 30% of the total raw sewage flow.
6.2.12 Since the facultative and maturation ponds would not be lined. there would be some
seepage of pond contents to groundwater. This is estimated at 103,680 m3/d, or about
99



25% of the raw sewage flow. This is on the basis of very little information on soil
quality in the area.
6.2.13 Thus the predicted effluent flow from the waste stabilization pond system is 235,534
m3/d. only 59% of the raw sewage flow.
Quantities of Treated Sludge for Disposal
6.2.14 The above svstem should produce a pathoigen-free sludge cake containing about 50%
dry solids. The expected volume of sludge for disposal is 33.330 cubic meters per year
(40,000 drv tons per year. or a weight including water of about 80.000 tons par year),
less than for the proposed project. 17 transport lorries would be required to make two
80 km round trips pet dav to the Varamin Plain on 150 working davs per vear. This
implies an annual mileage of 408.000 km. and an annual diesel consumption of 820
m3.
Materials
6.2.15 Stage I of the waste stabilization pond STP would require 7.922,299 m3 of excavation,
521.577 m3 of concrete and 52.057 tonnes of steel. The ponds would have to bc
constructed entirely above ground due to the shallow water table. There would be a
lower requirement for imported specialized equipment than for the proposed project.
Staffing
6.2.16 It is proposed that 208 personnel be employed for the operation of the Stage I STP, to
be made up of:
*   1 works manager and I assistant manager.
*   II in laboratory control and monitoring (I chemist and 10 technicians);
*   14 in administration:
*   98 in operations. and
*   83 in maintenance.
Requirements would increase with the implementation of Stage 2 of the project.
Schedule
6.2.17 The timescale for construction of the system would bc as for the proposed project
except for:
*   Detailed site and soil surveys during the first two years:
*   STP construction for the next four vears:
*   Works commissioning during the following year.
Impact on Local Population
6.2.18 It is possible that the village of Eshghabad will be directlv affected by land take for
the construction of the stabilization ponds and associated works. It wili be affected by
100



the loss of much of the agriculture land on which it depends. The village of
Eshghabad is a small farming community with a resident population of 32(,
expandinz during winter months to approximately 520 with immigrant farrn laborers;.
The village is served by eiectricity but obtains its water supply from qanats. It has a
primaryv school for 30 students and has a public bath. If constructed in this area, the
scheme mav require the relocation of the village Eshghabad near to the village of
Chaleh Tarkhan. It is not known whether adequate employment can be provided in
this area.
6.2.19 The construction of the sewage and effluent pipelines to the Eshghabad site will have
an environmental impact. alLhough until the final routes o these pipelines have been
decided. no firm assessment can be made. However. both the sewage and effluent
pipeline routes would have a considerable short terrn impact on the agricultural areas
through which thev would be constructed.
6.2.20 Onlv the village of Eshghabad would be affected bv noise during construction.
Residents of the village would only be affected where construction works encroachi
the villaze, or if construction traffic was allowed to pass through or use the village.
Any potential impacts could be minimized bv relocating the population prior to
commencing construction works.
6.2.21  Given the nature of the soil and the climate. dust mav be a problem to adjoining farms
during construction. Given the scale of the proposed project, it may be difficult to
control dust nuisance.
6.2.22 Anaerobic and facultative waste stabilization ponds can produce strong odors,
particularly hydrogen sulphide. if they are operated at incorrect loadings. The designs
presented above use loading rates which should avoid this problem.
6.2.23 Access to the site area can only be achieved via unsurfaced minor rural tracks. It is
unlikely that the route from the main Tehran to Varamin highway will need to be
strengthened in places to enable the heavv construction traffic to gain access. Given
the isolated nature of the site no significant impacts to any local population will occur.
6.2.24 The construction of the Stage 2 waste stabilization pond should have indirect effects
on a greater number of settlements.
Impacts on the Cultwual Environment
6.2.25 A cultural hill is located close to the village of Eshghabad. Whilst this feature is
unlikely to be directly affected by the construction works. care will have to be taken to
ensure that it is protected against damage caused by construction traffic or
unauthorized use by workers.
Impacts on Surface Waters
6.2.26 From initial study, it is likelv that the Sorkhe Hessar and Firouzabad canals and a
tributary of the Jaj-e-Rud river cross the site of the proposed first stage stabilization
ponds. If the scheme is to be constructed. it will be necessary to either divert these
101



substantial watercourses or to culvert them through the site. Care will be needed during
construction activities to prevent accidental pollution to these watercourses.
6.2.27 Evaporation and seepage from the ponds would result in a smaller quantity of effluent
being available for irrigation. and hence. fewer water resource benefits.
Impacrs on Groundwater
6.2.28 The water table in this area is very shallow. Care wil] have to be taken during
construction works to ensure that accidental spillage of fuel. construction materials do
not cause pollution to aroundwater. Should pumping be necessarv during the
construction works. care would also have to be taken to prevent contaminated water
being discharged to adjoining water courses.
6.2.29 Given the shallow water table and the likelihood of seepage from facultative and
maturation ponds. there is potential for the contamination of groundwater in the area.
It is difficult to predict whether or not there will be adverse impacts without a detailed
studv of the soil conditions in the area. The extent of local groundwater abstraction for
human consumption is not known. In addition. the effects of seepage from ponds on
local groundwater levels are not known and the potential for damage to agricultural
land in the vicinity of the ponds as a result of higher water levels is not known.
6.2.30 If sludge is stored on site temporarilv or for long term care, will have to be taken to
ensure that leachate does not pollute any adjoining water course or groundwater.
Impacts on Agriculture
6.2.31 The construction of stabilization ponds on this site would involve the destruction of
about 300 hectares of land presently used for agriculture. The construction of the
Stage 2 waste stabilization pond system would result in the destruction of a further
large area of agricultural land. Evaporation and seepage from the ponds would result
in a smaller quantitv of effluent being available for irrigation. and hence, smaller
agricultural benefits than for the proposed project.
Impact on Health
6.2.32 The possibility that species of Culex mosquitoes may use the open tracts of water  as
breeding sites has been considered in the design criteria for the use of the  waste
stabilization pond svstem. Mosquito larvae require still water to allow   their
development. The only parts of ponds which can provide such an environment    are
banks which become covered with debris or overgrown with grass or emergent
vegetation. Mosquito nuisance can be avoided by the instigation  of     suitable
maintenance procedures (regular cutting of grass around ponds  and   removal  of
debris)21. All health benefits within Tehran would be as for the proposed project.
102



Impacts on Clinmate
6.2.33 Though the predicted evaporation loss is a significant part of the sewage flow. it  is
thought that these quantifies are small in comparison to the atmospheric water  cycle
and would have little impact on climate. This has not been examined in detail.
Impacts on the Biological Environment
6.2.34 There are no known protected or important species of flora or fauna affected by the
construction of the ponds.
6.3          Sewage Treatment Using Aerated Lagoons
6.3.1  The draft review of sewage treatment process alternatives considered the use of aerated
lagoons for the proposed project instead of the conventional activated sludge process.
Under this option. the construction of the sewver network. all activities within the city.,
and the effluent and sludge reuse schemes would be same as for the proposed project.
Aerated lagoons are series of shallow earthen basins through which sewage flows with
mechanical aeration.
System Design
6.3.2 An aerated lagoon system designed for Stage I flows would consist of:
* an inlet works as for the proposed project;
* 8 aerated lagoons 461 m by 163 m by 4 m deep:
. 16 sedimentation basins 236 m by 157 m by 3.8 m deep;
o 24 maturation ponds 603 m by 166 m by 1.5 m deep; and
* chlorination equipment as for the proposed project.
6.3.3 Sludge would accumulate in the sedimentation basins. These would be operated on a 4
year rotation. with 12 of these in operation at a time and 4 used for storing sludge for
one year. The aerated lagoons be lined with concrete to prevent scouring. The
sedimentation basins would be lined with concrete to facilitate the removal of sludge.
The maturation ponds embankments would be lined with concrete at the water level to
prevent the growth of vegetation and to protect the embankments from wave action.
Sludge thickening and digestion equipment would not be needed.
Proposed Site and Ground Conditions
6.3.4  The total land area required for the above option is about 480 hectares (3,100 m by
1,150 m). A further 650 hectares would be required for Stage 2. The proposed
Southem STP site at Shahr-e-Rey is inadequate for this. The site identified for aerated
lagoons is that at Eshghabad proposed for the waste stabilization pond system
described in Section 6.2.
103



Pathogen Removal
6.3.5 Chlorination of the treated effluent wvould only be required in October. November,
March. and April, reducing the amount of chlorine used. The pathogen standard would
be achieved by the maturation ponds themselves from May to October. The total
retention time of the svstem. II davs. is sufficient for the removal of intestinal
nematode eggs without tertiary treatment.
Additional Svstem Requiremtents
6.3.5  Arrangements for the transport of sewage to and treated effluent from the site would be
as described in Section 6.2.
Power
6.3.7 The total installed power requirement for the entire Stage I works including the effluent
pumping station would be 68 MVA. Electricity would have to be brouzht from 20 km
away by supply lines. Power consumption would be 329.812.000 KWh per annum,
much higher than for the proposed project.There would be 6 diesel standby generators
giving a total output of 18 MW to provide sufficient power for operation of the essential
plant and equipment during any mains power failures. Twenty per cent of the power
consumption would be for the pumping of treated effluent back up to the irrigation area,
and 75% for aeration.
Evaporation and Seepage from Aerated Lagoons
6.3.8  The total surface area of water across the site envisaged in the Stage I Design is over
340 hectares, so a considerable quantity of water could be lost by evaporation. Taking
rainfall into account, it is predicted that 6.3 Mm3 of water would be lost each year (a
mean of 17,258 m3/d or 4.3% of the total flow). Perhaps more seriously, the predicted
mean daily water loss during the month of peak irrigation water requirement, June, is
33,664 m3/d. or 8.4% of the total raw sewage flow.
6.3.9  Since the maturation ponds would not be lined. there would be some seepage of pond
contents to groundwater. This is estimated at 20.736 m3/d, or about 5% of the raw
sewage flow. This is on the basis of very little information on soil qualitv in the area.
6.3.10 Thus the predicted effluent flow from the waste stabilization pond system is 362,006
m3/d, only 90% of the raw sewage flow.
Quantities of Treated Sludge for Disposal
6.3.11 The above system should produce a pathogen-free sludge cake containing about 50%
dry solids. The expected volume of sludge for disposal is 56,840 cubic metres per
year (68,210 dry tonnes per year, or a weight including water of about 135,000 tonnes
per year). About 28 transport lorries would be required to make two 80 km round
trips per day on 150 working days per year. This implies an annual mileage of
672.000 km, and an annual diesel consumption of 1.340 in3.
104



Mlfaterials
6.3.12 Stage I of the aerated lagoon STP wouid require 4.976.628 m3 excavation, 510,505 mn3
of concrete and 50.754 tons of steel. The lagoons. basins and ponds would have to be
constructed entirelv above ground due to the shallow water table.
Staffing
6.3.13 It is proposed that 275 personnel be emploved for the operation of the Stage I STP, to
be made up of:
*     I works manager and 2 assistant managers:
*     13 in laboratorv control and monitoring (I chemist and 12 technicians);
*     15 in administration:
*     128 in operations: and
*     116 in maintenance.
Requirements would increase with the implementation of Stage 2 of the project.
Schedule
6.3.14 The timescale for construction of the system w%ould be as for the wvaste stabilization
pond option.
Impact on Local Population
6.3.15 The impacts of relocation, disturbance, noise. and dust on the Eshghabad area would be
similar to those described for the waste stabilization pond option, though not as large.,
since a smaller area of land would be required.
6.3.16 The most likely source of odor would be the decomposition of settled sludge in
sedimentation basins. The minirnum. water depth above the sludge laver must be at
least 1.8 m in warm climates. This figure would be accommodated in the design of
ponds in this location. so odor nuisance is unlikely.
Impacts on the Cultural Environment
6.3.17 These would be as for the waste stabilization pond option.
Impacts on Surface Waters
6.3.18 The aerated lagoon system could avoid disturbance of the surface waters near the site.
Evaporation and seepage from the ponds would result in a slizhtly smaller quantity of
effluent being available for irrigation, and hence. fewer water resource benefits.
105



Impacts onl Groundwrater
6.3.19 Impacts on groundwater would be same as for the waste stabilization pond option.
The risk of pollution would be smaller. since there would be a smaller total area of
unlined ponds.
Impacts on Agriculture
6.3.20 The destruction of land presentlv used for agriculture could probably be avoided.  The
Stage 2 aerated lagoon system might result in the use of some agricultural  land.
Evaporation and seepage from the maturation ponds would result in a slightlv smaller
quantity of effluent being available for irrigation. and hence, smaller agricultural
benefits than for the proposed project.
Impacts on Health
6.3.20 The risk of mosquito breeding in sedimentation basins and maturation ponds could be
avoided by the instigation of suitable maintenance procedures (regular cutting of grass
around ponds and removal of debris)21. All health benefits within Tehran would be
same as for the proposed project.
Impacts on Climate
6.3.22 The predicted evaporation losses are small in comparison to the. atmospheric    water
cycle and would have little impact on climate. This issue has not been examined in
detail (and probably does not need to be studied).
Impacts on the Biological Environment
6.3.23 There are no known protected or important species of flora or fauna which are likely to
be affected by the construction of the aerated lagoon svstem.
6.4          Sewage Treatment Using Oxidation Ditches
6.4.1  The draft review of sewage treatment process alternativesl considered the use of
oxidation ditches for the proposed project instead of the conventional activated sludge
process. Under this option the construction of the sewer network. all activities within
the city, and the effluent and sludge reuse schemes would be same as for the proposed
project.
System Design
6.4.2  An oxidation ditch system designed for Stage I flows would consist of:
*     an inlet works same as for the proposed project;
*     primary sedimentation tanks same as for the proposed project;
*     9 anoxic basins 24 m by 24 m by 5 m deep;
*     18 oxidation ditches 145 m by 20 m by 3.5 m deep:
*     36 secondary sedimentation tanks of 28 m diameter:
106



*     chlorination equipment same as for the proposed project: and
*     sludge treatment svstems same as for the proposed project.
The above system should produce a pathogen-free sludge cake containing about 65%M:
drv solids. Quantities. volumes and transport costs would be same as for the proposec.
project.
Proposed Site
6.4.3  The Shahr-e-Rev site would be used for the oxidation ditch svstem. as is the case for
the proposed project.
Power
6,4.4  The total installed power requirement for the entire Stage I works including the
effluent pumping station would bc 13 MVA. Power consumption would be    63,792
KWh per annum. slightlv less than for the proposed project. There would be 3 diesel
standbv generators giving a total output of 4.8 MW to provide sufficient power for
operation of the essential plant and equipment during any mains power failures.
,Vfaterials
6.4.5  Stage I of the oxidation ditch STP would require 414,363 m3 of excavation. 295,375
m of concrete and 28.833 tonnes of steel.
staffing
6.4.6  Staffing requirements would be same as for the proposed project.
Schedule
6.4.7  The timescale for construction of the system would be same as for the proposed
project.
Impact on Local Population
6.4.8  The impacts of relocation, disturbance. noise. odor and dust on the
Eshghabad area would be similar to those described for the proposed project.
Impacts on the Cultural Environment
6.4.9  These would be same as for the proposed project.
Impacts on Surface Waters
6.4.10 These would be same as for the proposed project.
107



Inmpacts on Groundwater
6.4.11  These would be same as for the proposed project.
Impacts on Agricullture
6.4.12 These would be same as for the proposed project.
Impacts on Health
6.4.13 These wouid be same as for the proposed project. with similar concerns over the ability
of the svstem to achieve helminth egg removal and provide a disinfected effluent on
discharge to the Tehran canal.
Impacts on Climate
6.4.14 These would be same as for the proposed project.

6.4.15 These would be same as for the proposed project.
6.5            Comparison of Sewage Treatment Process Alternatives
6.5.1  The draft review of sewage treatment alternatives 1 contains a detailed financial    and
economic analysis of four sewage treatment options: the proposed project using a
conventional activated sludge system and the three processes described in Sections
6.2, 6.3 and 6.4. A summary of the financial analysis, using market prices currently
ruling in Iran, is presented in Table 6.2. This does not include costs of provision of
sewerage and house connections, only the STPs themselves and provision for effluent
and sludge reuse. The recurrent costs include power. staffing, consumables and sludge
transport.The benefits art those accruing from production ot- irrigation water (treated
effluent) and fertilizer (treated sludge).

6.5.2   A summary of the economic analvsis is presented in Table 6.3. This has the same
coverage as the financial analvsis, but also reflects the true costs and benefits of the
project to the Iranian economy. The costs attempt to reflect real resource and
opportunity costs, subsidies. price and trade controls, exchange rates and inflation.
They take account of historic costs such as that of the Shahr-e-Rey site, which has
alreadv been purchased. but has an economic value. The costs are discounted over a
20 year period.
6.5.3   The three alternative sewage treatment processes are shown to have higher financial
and economic costs than the proposed project.
6.5.4   The alternative of sewase treatment using waste stabilization ponds is rejected on the
following grounds:
*  relocation of the village of Eshghabad and disturbance of other populations;
*  unknown ground conditions at the Eshghabad site:
*  high construction costs due to the high water table:
* possibility of groundwater contamination due the high water table;
loss of agricultural land:
* higher financial and economic cost than the proposed project; and
* possible further loss of agricultural land due to the rise of groundwater levels
as a result of seepage from ponds.
6.5.5   Waste stabilization ponds are normally characterized by lower capital equipment costs
and current cost (particularly energy and manpower) but higher land costs than
activated sludge systems. The viabilitv of the option therefore, is highly sensitive to
the cost of land and the environmental impact of its use as stabilization ponds. In this
case, however, the option is more costly in terrms of equipment and civil works than
the proposed project. There are a number of reasons for this but the most important is
the need to pump treated effluent from the ponds to the distribution centre from which
109



it is conveyed to the Varamin agricultural area This involves additional costs
associated with pumps. pump houses. pipes and civil works and the costs otfoperating
these. These costs are largely absent from the STP options which use the Shahr-e Rey
site, the proposed project and oxidation ditches.
6.5.6  It is important to investigate the economic and environmental implications of not
conveying wastewater in this wav. If the treated effluent was not pumped to higher
elevations the following alternatives are possible.
*  The treated effluent could be conveved to the irrigation svstem at a lower level. It
is not currently known whether this is possible. at what cost and how many
farmers and what crops it would serve. The benefits to agriculture in the Varamin
Plain would be certain to be significantlv less than under the preferred option.
*  The treated effluent could bc used to recharge the groundwater all year round.
There would be no benefit to agriculture in the Varamin Plain.
*  The treated effluent could be discharged into appropriate canals and rivers. There
would bc no benefit to agriculture in the Varamin Plain.
6.5.7  The alternative of sewage treatment using aerated lagoons is rejected on the grounds
that this would entail much higher economic and financial costs than the alternative of
using waste stabilization ponds or the proposed project. whilst incurring the adverse
environmental impacts of the formner. Most of the greatly increased recurrent
economic costs are attributable to provision of aeration.
6.5.9   The alternative of sewage treatment using oxidation ditches is rejected on the grounds
that this would entail higher economic and financial costs than the proposed project,
with similar environmental impacts.
6.6           Water Conservation and Waste Minimization
6.6.1   The premise of this option is the idea that measures to reduce the consumption of
water and production of waste in Tehran could result in lower or weaker sewage
flows, the theory being that this could allow a smaller STP to serve the sewered  area,
giving economic and envitonmental benefits. However. this may not be feasible or
effective in-practice.
Measures
6.6.2   Water consumption in Tehran is 200 liters per capita per dav and is not  expected  to
increase.
6.6.3   The authorities could promote lower water consumption and the use of water saving
devices and discourage the use of wasteful appliances but this has not alwavs proved
successful elsewhere. The most effective encouragement would bc the imposition of
more realistic (less subsidized) prices for wvater. These should reflect resource costs
and rates of consumption and reflect the cost of sewage disposal as well as supply
(this would be more effective than separate prices for water and sewage disposal).
However. the structure of domestic wvater tariffs should not be so as to discourage the
use of quantities of water necessary to maintain health and quality of life: rather they
110



should discouraQe excessive use. Thus. charges could be related to numbers of taps
per household or propertv values. with much lower charges for those who are served
bv standpipes (who use much less water).
6.6.4  A decrease in industrial water consumption could also be encouraged by the
imposition of realistic tariffs along with the promotion of wastewater reuse within
industry for non-potable uses and recoverv of materials such as metals.
lInpacts
6.6.5  It is difficult to predict the effect on water consumption and waste production for that
the above mentioned strategies. Enforcement would be difficult, and the best
persuasion financial. Assuming that reductions could be achieved. it is unlikely  thai:
this would have any adverse environmental impacts. There could be    positive
environmental impacts in terms of lower resource use by industry, reductions in
environmental pollution and lower economic and resource costs for sewage treatment.
A smaller STP could serve the proposed Stage I sewered area.
6.6.6  However. it is not expected that this would change requirements for the Stage I STP.
If the above reductions could bc achieved (and observed bv monitoring sewage flows
and strengths), then this would allow Stage I STP to serve a part of the Stage 2 area.
Requirements for the Stage 2 STP (not yet designed in detail) could then be revised
downwards.
6.6.7  It should bc noted that the designs of all the STP units except for inlet works and
sedimentation tanks are based on organic load rather than sewage flow. The    above
measures would not alter domestic production of organic waste (BOD5), so design
requirements for most of the STP would not bc affected. .The industrial component of
the raw sewage BOD5 is not yet fully understood. and so prediction of changes cannot
be made.
Conclusions
6.6.8  Measures to encourage lower water consumption and waste production could bc
implemented, particularly by use of realistic water supplv and industrial discharge
tariffs. This would have environmental and possibly economic benefits, but would not
alter the proposed project for the Stage 1 STP.

7.0          MITIGATION MEASURES TO MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMIPACTS
I            Objeclives of the Environmental Wanagement Plan
The main objective is to address all the major environmental issues satisfactorily. The
major environmental issues have been identified earlier in Section 5. Impacts of the
Project. The EMP covers mitigation measures. monitoring, and institutional
strengthening for effective implementation (during construction and operation).
These are designed to eliminate or minimize adverse environmental and social
impacts. It also identifies actions needed to implement the mitigation measures by (a)
identifying a set of responses to be taken: (b) determine requirements for ensuring that
those responses are made effectivelv in a timely manner: and (c) describe the means
for meeting those requirements.
7.1.1   The Project Management Unit of TSC has compiled a list of the mitigative measures
which are included in the Project Implementation Plan. The purpose of this plan is to
ensure that the defined objectives of the Tehran Sewerage Project are achieved whilst
preventing or minimizing any potentiallv adverse environmental impacts. The EMP
will be carefully coordinated with the construction programme of the project, to
ensure that each relevant mitigative measure is implemented at the most appropriate
time and that resources are efficiently allocated.
Baseline Information
7.1.2  In order to properly gauge the performance of the project as a whole and to set the
future direction of developments, the situation will be fully monitored and compared
with the established baseline. Each issue to be affected by the project has been
identified and a programme of monitoring has been designed to efficiently establish a
datum for future changes. Areas of concem will not only include the quality aspects of
water and soil, but also social issues. agricultural production. general public health,
and the economic well-being of the communitv.
Monitoring
7.1.3  It is important to realize that while the collection of dait is necescary. the information
gained must be useful. There is no advantage in collecting a x Ide range of data, if a use
for it has not been defined. Programmes and procedures for monitoring have been
developed taking full consideration of economic and physical restrictions and budget
allowances.
7.1.4 A formal public education programme has also been started out in conjunction with the
EMP. This programme is outlined in Section 7.6.
112



7.2          Measures to Minimize Disturbance During Construction
7.2.1  During the construction of the project particularly the sewerage network, the  potenti.al
for causing disruption to public activities is the greatest. Monitorinz during this stage
will need to be continuous and will cover traffic impacts. noise and dust nuisances,,
disposal of spoil. and safery. Public liaison would have to be maintained.
7.2.2  The conditions of the contracts will include requirements for the work to be performed
as per international specifications.  If the contracts are properly prepared ancl
supervised. then disturbance will be minimized. Monitoring of the impacts during
construction will be undertaken by the Environment and Safety Officer (ESO) in the
Project Management Unit as part of their contract supervisory duties. and Department:
of Environment. Dedicated and fully trained personnel will be appointed to carry out:
this monitoring.
7.2.3  Monthly reports wvill be submitted to the TSC on the environmental impacts of
construction wvith recommendations for dealing wvith any problems including corrective
actions to be taken.
NVoise
7.2.4  During construction, all feasible measures (mentioned below) will be undertaken in
order to minimize the impacts of noise on the community. These measures will
include:
*    selection of up to date. well maintained plant with reduced noise levels ensured
by suitable in built damping;
   further screening of plant equipment such as air compressors and dewatering
pumps, particularly in the streets of Tehran. bv the use of sandbags, where
necessarv;
-   providing residents with advance wam'in2 of construction activities:
*   confining noisy work to normal working hours in the day, wherever possible;
providing the construction workers with suitable hearing protection and training
them in its use: and
*   restricting construction traffic movements during the night-time.
7.2.5  These measures will be included in the contract documents and undertaken by the
contractor. The PMU will ensure that they are carried out as part of its contract
supervision function.
Vibration
7.2.6  Vibration impacts from the construction phase will be mitigated by the following
measures:
*   the use of appropriate equipment that is modem and well maintained;
*   limiting the use of percussive equipment in the excavation of sewer trenches and
tunnel shafts
113



*   limitinq the use of percussive equipment in the excavation of sewer trenches and
tunnel shafts
* the use of dead-weight rather than vibration compaction plant when
compacting trenches close to buildings;
*  providing supports for existing buildings that are likely to be disturbed
or damaged; and
* the location of works away from sensitive buildings.
7.2.7  These measures will be included in the contract documents and undertaken by the
contractor. The PMU wili ensure that thev are carried out as part of its contract
supervision function.
7.2.8  As a precaution against excessive compensation claims for damage to property caused
by vibration, a programme of pre-construction audits will be developed well in
advance of the construction programme by the PMU's site supervisory staff. This
programme will involve the detailed inspection of all structures likelv to be affected
bv the project. in order to establish a baseline for defense or the minimization of
claims. Particularly susceptible buildings will be carefully surveyed to determine
support requirements for the prevention of damage.
Dust
7.2.9 The majority of dust problems caused by the construction of the project will be
mitigated by the implementation by the contractor of a few simple procedures:
construction activities causing dust will be not be carried out on excessively windy
days;
* unsealed routes for earthmoving equipment and general transport will be regularly
sprayed with water during dry weather;
excavation workfaces will be sprayed with water:
* stockpiles of excavated material will be covered with tarpaulins or
sprayed with water during dry weather: and
construction employees will be provided with masks for protection
against the inhalation of dust and be trained in their use.
7.2.10 These measures will be included in the contract documents and undertaken by the
contractor. The PMU will ensure that these are carried out as part of its contract
supervision function. Rather than leaving the perception of nuisance from dust to
individuals, weather conditions in which precautions should be taken by the contractor
will be specified by the PMU and included in the contract documents.
Disruption
7.2.11 Disruption impacts will principally be experienced during the construction period and
these will be mitigated by the following measures:
114



*  There will be liaison between the PMU and the transport. police. metro. electricity,
telephone. gas, and water supply authorities at an earlv staae;
* There will be coordinated planning of traffic diversions by the PMU. police ancl
the transport authorities and restrictions in accordance with the construction
programme. with advance warnings to the affected residents and road users;
*  The continual services of the police will be used in the diversion and control of
traffic.
* The PMU will coordinate the planning and construction of the sewerage system
with the construction of the Metro and anv other planned construction activities, ir.
order to achieve efficiencv of progress.
* The PMU will design and specify the construction works to minimize disruption.
*  The PMU will exercise care in the selection of tunnel shaft working areas and
identify the locations of all qanats in the vicinitv of the works.
* Under the supervision of the PMU, the contractor will restrict the length of open
trench and the amount of materials stored adjacent to the excavation works to that
necessarv for construction.
Community Relations
7.2.12 By establishing good community relations. any disruption experienced by the
community should quickly become apparent and will consequently be resolved with
due consideration for the community's needs. Bv providing advance publicity on the
work program and through the establishment of liaison arrangements between
members of the public, contractors and the project team, anv adverse public reaction to
project nuisance can be minimized.
7.2.13 As construction contractors move into a residential area, the PMU will inform residents
of the works to take place, their duration, and whom they should address their
complaints to. A procedure will be established to enable the public to complain about
excessive nuisance, disruption or disturbance due to the Tehran Sewerage Project. The
public should be able to do so via both the Public Relations Unit of the TSC and the
DOE-Tehran Province. If the complainant is not satisfied with the response from the
TSC, then he or. she has the right to refer the matter to an independent ombudsman to
be appointed by the Govemor of Tehran.
Resettlement
7.2.14 Although no permanent resettlement is envisaged for the project, it is possible that
there will be occasional cases where the temporary relocation of citizens may be
necessary. In these circumstances, physical and monetary assistance will be given, to
ensure that no-one is significantly inconvenienced by any disruption.
7.3          Measures to Minimize Disturbance During Operation of the STP
Noise
7.3.1  Noise impacts during the operation of the project will be confined to a few pieces of
equipment in the Sewage Treatment Plant. These are expected to be: compressors;
115



pumps: and stand-bv generators. There w ill also be some noise from the movement of
vehicies. By specifying appropriate silencers on the equipment and screening the
noisier areas of the STP with structures. there will be insignificant impact on local
residents. Traffic will be routed to keep this nuisance to a minimum. Impacts on the
STP employees will be further reduced as thev will be provided with hearing
protection equipment by the TSC and trained in its use.  In addition, all plant
equipment wvill be well maintained to maintain their efficiency and noise levels.
7.3.2  A formal maintenance programme will be established bv the TSC on the STP site and
elsewhere where plant is iocated. Noise levels will be regularly monitored within this
programme and anv defective equipment will be promptly dispatched for maintenance
by the TSC.
7.,.3  Land use Nvithin 500 meters of the STP has been formally allocated as a
-green/agricultural area. This will restrict the development of housing towards the site
and consequently avoid complaints regarding noise in the short or long term.
Odor
7.3.4  The PMU will minimize any problems caused by odour during operation of the STP
and associated works by:
* designing the STP to ensure minimum odour at the site boundary, such as
strategically locating the sludge treatment works with reference to the remainder
of the STP and the neighboring settlements:
careful planning and implementation of the STP operation and maintenance   to
prevent the formation and liberation of odors:
providing covers to containers and equipment likelv to cause an odour nuisance
and scrubbing of malodorous vapors: and
* designating the area around the site as green belt, thus restricting development
towards the site.
Screenings Disposal
7.3.5  The screenings from the STP will be disposed of by the TSC in an environmentally
acceptable manner by transporting in enclosed containers and burying in a municipal
landfill. Disposal in the landfill has been designed to ensure that groundwater or
surface runoff from the site will not be contaminated. Standard procedures will be
developed for the safe disposal of screenings with appropriate legislation for waste
disposal.
Visual Impacts
7.3.6  Although the visual impact of the STP will not be significantly adverse, it will be
beneficial to screen the STP as much as possible. Trees and bushes will be planted
around the perimeter of the STP by the contractor to enhance the appearance of the
overall STP and the taller parts of the STP which will be painted a non-intrusive
116



colour in order to alleviate any negative impact from a distance.These items will be
included in the construction contract.
7.3.7  The allocation of a green belt within 500 meters of the STP. as outlined above,
will ensure a more aesthetic appearance of the STP.
7.4           Measures to Ensure the Health and Safetv of Workers and the Public
7.4.1  By training all emplovees in the areas of occupational health and safety prior to their
commencing work and regularlv thereafter. anv adverse effects on their health and
safetv will be minimized.
Planning
7.4.2  Public access to the STP effluent in the Tehran canal will be restricted where
disinfection will not be completed in the interests of public health and safety. To
ensure this. the first 2 km of the channel will be fully restricted bv the installation of a
secure fence.
7.4.3  The design of the STP wvill include measures for preventing attraction and breeding of
pests. A regular eradication programme will be carried out using the application of
biodegradable pesticides at appropriate levels.
Construction
7.4.4  The contractor will ensure that construction employees are trained in safety procedures
for all relevant aspects of construction and that these procedures are always adhered
to. The PMU will make regular checks that the contractor is following safe practices.
7.4.5  In order to ensure that all work is carried out safely, everv team employed by the
contractor or TSC will be lead by a fully trained supervisor with easy access to
emergency services. In addition to this. an appropriate number of site personnel will
be trained in First Aid.
7.4.6  Formal emergencv procedures will be developed for each construction site for the
event of an accident.
7.4.7  The safety of the public at all stages of the construction will be ensured by appropriate
public education and safety measures such as the use of barriers, flags, and bollards.
Operation
7.4.8  The TSC will ensure that operation and maintenance personnel of the STP are fully
aware of the hazards involved in the running of a system of this nature. All site
employees will be trained in hygienic procedures designed to avoid infection from
wastewaters and sludges. The workers will be educated in the dangers of leptospirosis
and provided with documentation to alert medical practitioners to the possibility of
such an infection when diagnosin2 them. Thev will also be inoculated against
infectious diseases such as polio and tetanus and be under medical surveillance.
117



7.4.9  Formal emergency procedures will be developed by the PMU in conjunction with
TSC for dealing with accidents. These procedures will involve the coordination of
emergency services such as the fire brigade and health services.
7.4.10 In particular. emergencv procedures will be developed in the event of the release of
chlorine gas. A warning device for the detection of chlorine gas will be provided
where chlorine is to be used.
7.5           Emplovee Training and Working Conditions
7.5.1  To ensure that the project achieves its objectives. a suitable training programme will be
developed. Many different levels and fields of personnel will require instruction in
their intended works and the complexitv of this training will vary greatly. While the
initial training will involve the preparation of employees for the commissioning of the
project. it is important that a formal training programme be carried out regularly so
that all levels of staff can be given opportunities for promotion and newv staff trained as
necessarv. Training of personnel in the processina of data from all monitoring
programmes will also be undertaken.
7.5.2  The Government will encourage development of courses in local educational
institutions that will be directly applicable to the project. for example in trades,
science. public health engineering, and management, to secure a readily accessible
qualified workforce for the future.
7.5.3  The TSC will also develop close relationships with equivalent organizations in other
countries. Through such a relationship, personnel could be trained and a wider breadth
of experience could be gained.
Construction Workers
7.5.4  During the construction of the STP and the associated w orks. adequate facilities will be
provided for the construction workers. This will include the provision of temporary
housing, suitable transport to and from the construction sites, washing, sanitation and
ablution facilities, and ease of access to commercial facilities where necessary.
Sewage Treatment Plant Staff
7.5.5  Staff at the Sewage Treatment Plant will be trained in the operations and maintenance
of the STP as well as in occupational health and safety, while those in supervisory
positions will also be trained in the supervision and management of their personnel.
The persons controlling the management of the STP will be highly experienced and
fully qualified in a science or engineering field as well as in management.
7.5.6  The contractor responsible for the construction of the STP will also be made
responsible for the operation of the STP and the training of staff for a period of 2 to 3
years after the commissioning of the STP.The contractor will be required to provide
comprehensive operation and maintenance manuals. In addition, the contractor will be
required to provide standard operating job procedures as a part of the training scheme.
118



7.5.7  It is important that the STP be regarded favorably as a place of emplovment. Any
cultural aversion to dealing with human waste will be considered with tact and taken
into account in the design of operating procedures. Positions will be permanenit
wherever possible. job status and promotion prospects will be good and salaries must,
be of a level to support this. Job incentives will also be available to employees in the
form of bonuses and sponsored education. The organization will be structured to
facilitate a flexible approach.
7.5.8  Facilities for personnel at the STP and other places of emplovment will be hygienic
and maintained in good condition. Operating personnel will have access to full
washing, sanitation. and ablution facilities at all times.
Analytical Services
7.5.9  Laboratories will bc staffed bv fully qualified personnel who have been trained in
correct and up-to-date procedures for the analysis of waters. soils. treated effluent and
sludge, and crops. This training will initiallv involve the secondment of four or five
relevant Iranian nationals to independent analvtical organizations for a sufficient
period to allow them to gain an insight into procedures involved. Laboratory staff will
be trained in occupational health and safetv and supervision of personnel.
Environmental Protection Guards
7.5.10 Because the Environmental Protection Guards of the DOE are to have considerable
contact with the community, it is essential that all staff within it are trained in public
relations. Instruction will also cover relevant legislation and standards, sampling and
monitoring procedures. enforcement procedures and occu.pational health & safety,
where applicable.
Customer and Public Relations
7.5.11 In order to avoid any confusion that may be felt by the community in the
implementation of the project. staff in the Customer Ser. .ces and Public Relations
Departments of the DOE and the TSC will be trained in communication, the role of
the project in the development of Tehran, and gene-' public hen!"V<; issues. The staff
will be continually informed of the progress of the project r -.c1 vijil, on a long-term
basis, always be aware of the relevant issues.
7.6          Measures to Ensure that the Objectives of the Project are Achieved
Public Health Education
7.6.1  The Ministry of Health, assisted by the TSC, will conduct a public health education
campaign on matters related to the Tehran Sewerage Project. These will cover:
personal hygiene:
the need for safe disposal of faeces (especially those of children);
119



* the health hazards associated with polluted waters such as the
Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals:
* the health hazards associated with the use of untreated sewage and
sludge on crops; and
* health benefits of the Tehran Sewerage Project.
7.6.2  A comprehensive programme will be carried out at all levels of the community.  After
an initial full-scale programme. continuing efforts will be required to ensure that each
sector of the community comprehends the advantages of the project. Care will bc
taken that the programme compliments the cultural values of the people. The whole
education process will be scheduled so that ultimately it is verv effective.
Complementary Medical Programmes
7.6.3  The Ministry of Health will instigate programmes of mass chemotherapy to combat
helminthic disease progressively in each area of Tehran after it is sewered.This will
commence at a time when worm burdens are the greatest: there is some evidence
(from the Shahr-e-Rey survev) that this is in August.The programme will be repeated
at intervals of no greater than 60 davs for a period of twelve months. the effectiveness
being monitored from review of influent egg concentrations at the STP and health
statistics collated by the Ministry of Health. Mass treatment of agricultural workers
and their families will probably be less expensive than the identification and treatment
of exposed persons. since the effluent will be used on many small farms.
Public Education about the Project
7.6.4  The Public Relations Department of the TPWSC will instigate a programme to educate
the public about:
' the benefits of the Tehran Sewerage Project as a whole:
*  the advantages of using a sewer system rather than sewage wells: and
* the correct use of the sewer system (such as a prohibition on the disposal of large
objects into the system).
7.6.5  Farmers will be educated in the safe and efficient use of treated effluent and sludge  in
agriculture and a formal advisory service will be set up under the auspices   of   the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Co-operation (MARC) to facilitate this. In most
cases. the service will be provided at no cost to the farmers in order to achieve the best
results.
Connection to the Sewerage System
7.6.6 It is possible that some individuals will be unwilling to have their properties connected
to the new sewerage system, preferring to continue with the use of traditional  sewage
wells. hile public education by the Ministry of Health and the TSC should minimize
this, the DOE will enforce connection through its Environmental Protection Guards.
The continuing use of sewage wells will be forbidden in sewered areas.
120



lndustrial Wastewaters
7.6.7 In order for the project to achieve its objectives. it is important that industrial
discharges in Tehran are quantified and regulated. The institutional responsibilities for
dealing with industrial discharges will be made clear to those who generate them:
*      the DOE will reguiate industrial discharzes to the environment: and
*      the DOE and TSC wili regulate industrial discharges to the sewer system.
Industrial Wastewaters Discharges to ihe Environment
7.6.8  The DOE has established an inventorv of all current sources of industrial wastewaters
in Tehran (as shown in Table 7.1) and will monitor their connection to the sewer
svstem. Industries will have the choice between connection to the sewer and providinp:
full treatment themselves tocomply with the standards set bv the DOE.
7.6.9 The DOE will be able to charge a fee for each discharge to the environment (rivers,
canals, groundwater) by industry which will be based on the quantity and quality of
the discharge, thus introducing the concept of "polluter pavs" and emphasizing to the
industrial sector the advantages of treating wastes at source.
7.6.10 The DOE will have the power to set and enforce limits for BODS, suspended solids,
ammonia, pH, metals, toxic and hazardous substances. temperature and flow. It
prohibits discharges which contravene the established standards through its
Environmental Protection Guards. This will cause relocation of the industrial discharge
Source, improvement of onsite treatment, or connection of the discharge to sewer. The
limits will be established under the Technical Assistance component and will be
consistent with internationally recognized good industrial practices.
7.6.11 Industry will be given access to advice on the most modem and effective methods of
industrial wastewater treatment by the DOE through its Environmental Education
Department. in order to allow that sector to make a reasonably smooth transition to full
compliance with the new legislation.
Industrial Wastewaters Discharged to Sewers
7.6.12 TSC will have full jurisdiction over industrial wastewater sources that are seeking
connection to the sewerage svstem. The TSC will have the ipTentive to ensure that the
treated effluent from the STP complies with the standards set bv the DOE.
7.6.13 The TSC will establish an inventory of all industrial discharges to the sewer network as
they are connected and will have access to information with DOE on them.
7.6.14 The TSC will have the power to set limits for BOD5, suspended solids, ammonia, pH,
metals. toxic and hazardous substances (including arsenic, cadmium, chromium,
copper, lead, mercurv, nickel, and zinc), temperature and flow for each industrial
source discharging to the sewerage system, and DOE will enforce them. TSC will
coordinate these activities with DOE in order to ensure that its own discharges from
the STP meet the set standards which will be monitored by the DOE and independently
verified.

7.6.15 The TSC Nvill charge a fee for each discharge to the sewerage svstem which is related
to the quantitv and quality of the discharge. This will again introduce the concept cif
"polluter pavs" and encourage industrial pretreatment including neutralization.
7.6.16 The TSC will have the power to forbid a particular discharge to the sewerage system
or require on-site pretreatment where that discharge could damage the fabric of the
sewers or endanger performance of the STP. In this case. the industry will have to
provide its own treatment to comply with the DOE standards.
7.6.17 The TSC will be able to levy fines on or refuse licenses to those customers who fail to
comply with its requirements. The TSC will give advice on appropriate methods of
pretreatment of industrial wastewaters prior to discharge to sewer where necessarv.
Industrial Discharge Legislation
7.6.18 The negative impacts of industrial wastewater discharges to the surface water, to
agriculture. and groundwater via the new sewerage svstem and STP will be mitigated
bv the above monitoring system and the enforcement of trade waste control legislation.
A technical assistance component of the project wvill address this issue. This
legislation will include standards and conditions of discharge to the sewerage system,
supported by effective enforcement in the event of non-compliance. The legislation
will outline a standardized and unambiguous approach to the control of industrial
discharges to the sewer system. The DOE is willing to negotiate with (as well as
monitor) industry and the TSC. Each case will be handled individually with licenses
realistically setting long and short-term targets. taking all scientific and economic
factors into account. These measures will supplement the ongoing program on
relocation of industries from Tehran.
Water Conservation and Waste Mininmization
7.6.19 Measures to encourage lower water consumption and waste production will be
implemented, particularly by use of realistic water supply and industrial discharge
tariffs.
7.6.20 Sources of cadmium within the city will be identified and quantified  by  the  DOE.
Once identified, action will be taken to relocate these industries out of Tehran or to
ensure that their production of waste cadmium is separated out or minimized. The
industrial sources of cadmium may include electroplating, stabilization of plastics,
pigments production. and the production & disposal of batteries.
Transport
7.6.21 It is essential that sufficient transport facilities be provided for the employees of the
Sewage Treatment Plant and the associated works to make the STP easily accessible.
The TSC will provide transport to the STP for employees. The STP access road will
be maintained in a good condition. The road from the Sewage Treatment Plant to the
sludge holding bay at the Varamin Plain agricultural area will also be regularly
123



maintained. The transport used for sludge transfer will also be maintained in a good
condition to ensure a reliable service.
Agriculture
7.6.22 Because the project will have a considerable effect on the agricultural sector. its
peration wviI] be examined. The irrization water distribution svstem will be evaluated
and modified to improve the overall efficiency of the re-use facilities. Proper flow
measurement svstems will be set up to measure. with a reasonable degree of accuracy,
the volumes of water and treated effluent used by each of the farners. Farmners will be
educated in the most effective methods of farming. Government investment in the
region would improve the production of the area and increase the financial benefits.
7.7          Environmental Monitoring
7.7.1  The principle upon which the allocation of responsibilities for monitoring is based is
that of separation between those who implement and those who regulate. The TSC is
to implement the project while the DOE w ill independently monitor the impacts of the
project.
Regulatorv Monitoring bv the Department of Environment
7.7.2  The DOE will be responsible for the monitoring of discharges to the environment and
their effects to ensure that the required standards are met and adverse  impacts  are
minimized. Where necessary, the sampling and analysis may be carried out by
specialists such as other government departments. private companies or academic
research institutions (but not the TSC). The DOE will be responsible for funding and
overseeing their activities and collation and dissemination of the resultant information.
The following items will be covered.
7.7.3  Final effluent from the STP will be regularly monitored to ensure compliance with the
standards for BOD5 suspended solids. total nitrogen. faecal coliforms and intestinal
nematode eggs described in Table 7.2.  It is recommended that one 24-hour
flow-weighted composite sample is taken every week, that is samples wvill be taken
once an hour over 24 hours. then mixed in direct proportion to the effluent flow at the
time of sampling. This would then produce one sample for analysis which is
representative of performance over 24 hours.
7.7.4  Effluent mixed with river water used in irrigation on the Varamin Plain will be
regularly monitored for compliance with FAO standards5 at the point of use, that is in
the irrigation channels. If this is not feasible, then it will be satisfactory to separately
monitor the effluent at the STP and the river water in the Jaj-e-Rud and combine the
results.

7.7.5   Treated sludge disposed of to agricultural land for use as a fertilizer will be monitored
for compliance with the standards for metals in sludge and application rates described
in the 1986 EC directive on the use of sewage sludge in agriculture8 (cadmiur,
chromium. copper. nickel. lead. mercury and zinc). Several spot samples will be taken
from each batch of stored sludge taken to the Varamin Plain. It will also be necessary
to measure sludge moisture content to calculate the above. These figures and sludge
application rates will allow estimation of future compliance with limit values f:)r
accumulated metals in soils8. The DOE will ensure that treated sludge is being stored
for at least one vear prior to its use on agricultural land.
7.7.6  Soil in areas where effluent or siudge are used in agriculture wvill be monitored for the
above metals to ensure compliance with the 1986 EC directive on the use of sewage
sludge in agriculture. Concentrations will be measured before anv application takes
place (baseline) and after each year of application. so each area will be monitored
everv four vears. It will also be necessarv to measure soil pH.
7.7.7   As described in Section 7.6. the DOE will regularly monitor all effluents discharged
by industry to the environment (canals. rivers. and land).
7.7.8  The DOE wvill monitor the qualitv of Tehran's surface waters such as the Firouzabacd
and Sorkhe Hessar canals. This should reveal improvements in water quality and
highlight any continuing pollution problems. The parameters to be monitored include:
BOD5, suspended solids, ammonia, nitrates, metals, fecal coliforms and intestinal
nematode eggs.
7.7.9  There is uncertainty surrounding the level of arsenic contamination in Tehran due tco
historic data of concern. It is recommended that the following be monitored for
arsenic by the DOE as part of the above programme untii it is shown that there are no
problems of this type:
* discharzes to the environment from industry and public baths:
* effluent and sludge from the proposed STP:
* soils and crops in the Varamin Plain;
* groundwater from under the City and the Varamin Plain; and
* surface waters such as the Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals.
Sewage Treatment Plant Operation Monitoring by the TSC
7.7.10 The TSC  will perform  operational monitoring  to ensure that STP  performrs
satisfactorily and that effluent and sludge from the STP complies with the set
standards with monitoring by the DOE.
7.7.11 The raw sewage arriving at the STP and the final effluent will be regularly monitored
by the TSC for BOD5, suspended solids. total nitrogen, faecal coliforms, and
intestinal nematode eggs to assess performance. Spot samples will be taken once a
day so that the operators can respond to any irregularities.Treated sludge disposed of
to agricultural land for use as a fertilizer will be monitored for moisture content, pH.
cadmium. chromium copper, nickel, lead, mercury, and zinc. These samples will be
126



for use within the TSC. not for the assessment of compliance with standards by the
DOE.
7.7.12 The TSC will also monitor particular units within the treatment works such as the
primarv sedimentation tanks and aeration tanks to assess their perforrnance.
Knowledge of the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids within the aeration
tanks and the settleabilitv of the activated sludgc will allow optimisation of operation.
7.7.13 Particular attention will be paid by the TSC to review the performance of STP in
removing intestinal nematode eggs. If the effluent quality data show that the
arithmetic mean number of eggs is greater than the WHO guideline of one per litre,
then the TSC will review the treatment process and operations to ensure compliance
with the WHO guidelines. The Appendix presents performance data from currently
operating sewage treatment plants. The data show that the influent levels of nematode
eggs is less than 100 eggs per liter and the effluent had less than I egg per liter.
7.7.14 The quality of the treated effluent will be carefully controlled at the STP to the
required limits. using efficient and up to date methods using accurate analytical
procedures. All discrepancies detected will be immediately notified to those
concemed. and the problem promptly dealt with at the source. A suitable response
system will be developed at the STP. in the event that problems do develop, and all
relevant staff will be fullv trained in the corrective measures to be taken. Provision
will be made for the diversion of non-complying STP discharges to nearby surface
waters. thereby preventing its discharge to agricultural land. Discharges to the
Firouzabad canal will take place in accordance with established procedures which will
take account of physical and chemical effects on the canal having regard to the
particular circumstances prevailing at the time.
7.7.15 As described in Section 7.6, the TSC will monitor all effluents discharged by industry
to the sewerage system and hence, to the STP for BOD5, suspended solids, ammonia,
pH, metals. toxic substances, temperature and flow where necessary.The Appendix
presents: (a) List of Equipment and Instruments Required for Laboratory at STP; and
(b) Required Number of People in the Laboratory at STP.
7.7.16 The waters of the Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals are not likely to conform with
the recommended WHO standards for unrestricted irrigation due to numerous other
discharges to them.. The quality of these canals will be improved by strict control of
such discharges by the DOE. Existing small sewage treatment plants should be
upgraded to the standards used for the Southern STP or their final effluent discharges
connected into the proposed sewerage system
Groundwater Recharge
7.7.17 Treated effluent recharged on the Varamin Plain will become part of the groundwater
resources managed by the TRWB, who will establish a monitoring programme to
confirm that groundwater quality is not adversely affected. The content of nitrate,
ammonia and metals in the groundwater beneath the Varamin Plain will be monitored
at existing or new wells. Groundwater resources will be carefully evaluated by the
127



TRWB so that zones where recharge would bc inadvisable. such as adjacent to potable
water wells. can be identified.
7.7.18 Supporting legislation will be developed for the categorization of these well heacl
protection zones. with adequate enforcement procedures and appropriate penalties.
Permissible frequency and quality requirements of recharge will be investigated at an
early stage to enable the optimum development of a discharge strategy. Contingency
plans will be developed for the event that the qualitv of the treated effluent does not
meet specified standards for recharge.
Agriculture
7.7.19 Adverse impacts of the use of treated effluent and sludge on the agricultural land will
be effectively mitigated by the imposition of industrial effluent controls as outlined
above. In addition. the MARC will be responsible for monitoring the following in the
Varamin Plain:
-  general suitabilitv of crops for consumption:
-  plant tissue quality (heavy metals, boron. and arsenic);
-  contamination of crop by pathogens:
-  crop production;
-  the health of livestock;
-  nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium content of soils, fertilizers, manures
and sludges; and
-  moisture retention properties. pH and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios in soils.
7.7.20 If the MARC does not carry out the sampling and analysis itself, then this may be
carried out by specialists such as other government departments, private companies or
academic research institutions (but not the TSC). The MARC will remain responsible
for funding and overseeing, their activities and collation and dissemination of the
resultant infornation. Samples will be analyzed bv reputable laboratories and the data
made available to the DOE.
7.7.21  Baseline data will be established at an early date for the existing conditions in the
agricultural area. in order to refine the effluent & sludge re-use strategies and identify
any deficiencies or potential hazards. This data will be regularly updated during
project implementation.
7.7.22 The MARC will also have access to data on concentrations of metals in sludge and
soil held by the DOE. In the event that the limits are exceeded or there is concern
over crop quality, the MARC will have the power to prohibit the consumption of the
crops grown in the areas affected.
7.7.23 The MARC will keep a formal record of volumes of sewage sludge used and
chemical constituents in conjunction with the DOE. An electronic database will be set
up and maintained by the MARC. It is considered that the introduction of a suitable
computer model would be beneficial in this regard.
128



Monitoring and Evaluation
7.7.24 In order that the environmental effects of the Project are adequately controlled by the
mitigation measures. the DOE is preparing a forrnal Strategic Monitoring Plan (for
Qualitv Assurance and Quality Control) and will produce periodic review reports
throughout the life of the Project for the Minister of Energy and the Governor of
Tehran. The Ministry of Energy will have the overall responsibilitv to ensure that the
adverse impacts from the project are maintained to acceptable levels and corrective
actions are taken when requzired. A summarv of the monitoring activities discussed
below is provided in Tables 7.3 through 7.8.  During construction. monitoring
program will include dust and noise. The monitoring reports will also include data on
BOD. COD, suspended solids. cadmium (and other heavv metals as necessary), fecal
coliform. and nematode eggs for the treated effluent. The sludge will be monitored
for nematode eggs, coliform. toxic metals (including arsenic. cadmium. chromium,
lead. and mercury, as appropriate). In addition. odor. noise, and vibration will be
monitored at receptor sites to ensure that these are at acceptable levels. Soil and
agriculture produce from Varamin plain will be monitored for significant pollutants
including heavy metals such as cadmium (for soil and produce), and fecalcoliform &
nematode eggs (for agriculture produce). The surface water in Varamin canal will
also be monitored for chlorine. The Ministrv of Health will monitor the public health
indicators (such as gastrointestinal diseases) to assess project impacts. A project
monitoring report will be prepared on the effectiveness of the EMP once every 6
months and sent to the Bank after review and clearance from the DOE.
7.7.25 The DOE will review baseline data and implement its own environmental monitoring
program: TRWB will monitor groundwater resources: and Ministry of Agriculture
will monitor the agriculture produce from Varamin Plains. It will indicate changing
environmental conditions and identify impacts of the scheme as thev occur. If these
agencies identify significant adverse impacts. appropriate mitigation measures and
institutional changes will be made and arrangements for amendments to the
Management Plan will be made. Interagencv coordination will be effectively
implemented through liaison sub-committees with the project committee (chaired by
the Deputy Minister of Municipal Water & Sewage Affairs in the Ministry of Energy)
meeting at least once every 6 months.
7.7.26 The strategic monitoring will review the effectiveness of the Management Plan for
mitigation measures, for example: the revision of legislation to improve
environmental protection; measures to minimize disturbance due to construction;
development of re-use strategies by the Ministrv of Agriculture; occupational health
and safety training and procedures for emergencies during construction and
operation; public health education by the Ministry of Health; control of industrial
discharges by the Environmental Protection Guards of DOE and the TSC ; and the
water conservation and waste minimization program.

7.8 Finance
Budgets
7.8.1   Budgets for all components of the project will be reviewed regularly and with
allowances for maintenance and contingencies like equipment breakdown. Budget
control will be carried out by the TSC. with regular reporting to the Ministry of
Energy. A computerized cost control system would enable monitoring and analysis
of all cost and revenue data and would provide perfornance indicators for the
project.
Revenue
7.8.2  The setting of the rates for the collection and treatment of the sewage from Tehran
must be carefullv considered. It is essential that all costs are covered. Nevertheless,
realistic costs and pavback periods must be cited in the economic evaluation of the
project and in the setting of rates to minimize anv adverse economic impacts.
7.9 Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
7.9.1  The EMP covers mitigation measures, monitoring, and institutional strengthening
during implementation (construction and operation) to eliminate adverse
environment and social impacts, offset them. or reduce them to acceptable levels. It
identifies actions needed to implement the mitigation measures by (a) identifying a
set of responses to potentially adverse impacts; (b) determine requirements for
ensuring that those responses are made effectivelv in a timely manner; and (c)
describe the means for meeting those requirements.
Mitigation of Adverse Environmental Impacts
Major Issues
7.9.2  The EMP includes mitigation measures to ensure that the defined objectives of the
Tehran Sewerage Project are achieved whilst preventing and reducing potentially
adverse environmental impacts. Tables 7.9 and 7.10 provide a summary of
mitigation measures for the major environmental issues as discussed below. The
mitigation measures are to be executed by the Construction Contractor and STP
Operator with supervision by TSC. Monitoring will be carried out by TSC's
Environment and Safety Officer (for dust and noise during construction; for treated
effluent & sludge, odor, and noise during operation) and Ministry of Agriculture (for
agriculture produce and soil). Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC)
monitoring will be performed by the DOE.

Effluent Qualitn
7.9.3  The activated sludge process is capable of reducing the concentration of intestinal
niematode parasite eggs to less than 1% of the concentration in the raw sewage
entering the system. A UJNDP mission has indicated that based on analyses of
sewage from a restricted area of Tehran. the process proposed is capable of
producing an effluent which will comply with the WHO guidelines for intestinal
nematode eggs in effluent to be used for irrigation. From the outset of operation, a
program for monitoring of effluent egg concentrations will be instituted. Additional
treatment has been provided to ensure compilance with all the appiicable WHO
guidelines including those for nematode eggs.
7.9.4  TSC will also provide secure fencing along the first 2 km of the Tehran-Varamin
Canal starting from the Sewage Treatment Plant to protect public health by ensuring
that dis-infection is complete.
7.9.5  The Department of Environment (DOE) has issued guidelines for conducting
Environmental Assessment and promulgating standards for industrial discharges to
surface water and effluent discharges from the sewage treatment plant. In addition,
there are standards for ambient dust, noise. and odor. These will be adhered to in the
project. In addition, the treated effluent will meet the WHO' guidelines for treated
water to be used in agriculture. These guidelines specify a nematode level of less
than I egg per liter and total fecal coliformn level of less than 1 000 MPN per 100 ml.
The BOD level of the effluent at the STP discharge point will be less than 25 mg/l.
Sludge Qualitv
7.9.6  For the use of treated sludge as soil conditioner. compliance with the European
Union (EU), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and WHO Guidelines
(including the limit of less than I intestinal nematode egg per 100 gms of dry solids)
will be ensured by providing adequate treatment including a drying period of one
year.
Industrial Discharges
7.9.7  The polluting industries are being relocated and the remaining    major industries
will have to comply with the DOE's limits for effluent dischar_c. These regulations
are being enforced. In addition, the project will only provide connections to
industries that do not discharge toxics which may affect the performance of the
Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). The Technical Director of STP and Director of
Department of Environment will jointly approve all industrial connections. The
project will ensure that the industrial effluent discharges are pre-treated (where
required) to levels which comply with the World Bank's Environmental Guidelines
mentioned in the "Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook" after taking into
account the reduction achievable at STP for all the significant parameters of concern.
In summary, the project will follow internationally accepted Good Practices and
comply with applicable Iranian regulations.
136



7.9.8  The Project Management Unit has drawn up a detailed Environmental Management
Plan which includes mitigation measures to epsure that the defined objectives of the
Tehran Sewage Project are achieved whilst preventing or minimizing any potentially
adverse environmental impacts. Tables 2 and 3 provide a summary of mitigation
measures for the major environmental issues as discussed below. The mitigation
measures are to be carried out by the Construction Contractor and STP Operator with
supervision by TSC. Also. QA/QC monitoring wvill be performed bv the DOE.
Other Mitigation Measures
7.9.9  The general disruption during construction will be mitigated by coordinated
planning of construction  activities.  This will include coordination with the
authorities from the municipalitv, transport. police, electricity, telephones. gas, and
water supply before commencing construction activities. Appropriate permits will
also be obtained. The other adverse impacts during the construction phase, namely
noise. vibration and dust will be mitigated by the careful design of the Project and
adoption of Good Practices. These will include providing wind breakers and wetting
of spoil to prevent fugitive dust emissions w here appropriate: limiting noisy
activities to dav time and providing mufflers to minimize noise nuisance; worker
safety measures such as wearing overalls, safetv hats. work boots. and gloves;
controlling traffic and placing warning signs at construction sites: and securing the
sites (especially where trenches are cut) by fences, brick, or prefabricated partition
walls. The contract documents will include requirements for these measures to
minimize disturbance from construction activities and will be monitored everyday
by the Environmental Safety Officer (ESO) to ensure contractor's compliance.
7.9.10 Liaison arrangements will be established between the public, contractors, and the
Project Management Unit. A procedure has been established to allow the general
public to lodge complaints at the Project Management Unit about excessive
disturbance due to construction.
7.9.11 The contractor will provide suitable and reliable equipment for construction, with a
formal maintenance program established to ensure efficient operations. The TSC will
develop and establish suitable procedures for the operation and maintenance of the
Sewage treatment Plant. The employees will get appropriate training. Training in
emergency procedures and occupational health & safety will be provided for all
employees of the contractor and the TSC. Suitable safety equipment will also be
provided.
7.9.12 Odors from the treatment plant will be minimized (scrubbers will be provided on
vents, where needed) by careful planning and implementation of the plant operation
and maintenance. The established buffer zone wvill ensure that the visual, noise and
odor impacts are acceptable. Solid waste from the STP will be disposed of in an
environmentally acceptable manner in a municipal landfill.
7.9.13 The Environmental Protection Guards of the DOE will establish and impiement
formal programs for the monitoring of discharges to the environment from the
Sewage Treatment Plant and industry: treated sludges: surface water: soil: and
agriculture produce from the Varamin Plain. wvith set procedures in the event of
137



noncompliance. It will develop a system of controls on discharges to the Firouzabad
and Sorkhe Hessar canals. The DOE has developed and implemented standards for
the control of industrial discharges to the environment. DOE will also develop and
implement the standards for the control of industrial discharges to the proposed
sewer svstem under the technical assistance component of the project. No
connections will be given to industries that may discharge toxics (such as heavy
metals includinp cadmium) which mav impact the performance of STP or whose
discharge is not expected to meet the pretreatment limits which will be based on the
World Bank's Environmental Guidelines mentioned in the "Pollution Prevention and
Abatement Handbook" after taking into account the reduction in concentration
expected at STP. To monitor this and other projects. DOE has equipped three
laboratories where currently 6 people are emploved and it is planned to employ 4
more. Tehran sewage project would require 8 persons at the laboratorv located in
southem STP.
7.9.14 TSC will establish *and implement formal programs for the monitoring of raw
sewage, operational parameters. treated effluent and sludge at the Sewage Treatment
Plant. and industrial discharges to the sewer. The TSC will develop education
programs and advisory services for the industrial sector in conjunction with the DOE.
7.9.15 TSC will also provide secure fencing along the first 2 km of the Tehran-Vararnin
Canal starting from the Sewage Treatment Plant to ensure that dis-infection is
complete and public health is protected.
7.9.16 The Ministry of Health will conduct a public hygiene education campaign to reduce
the incidence of solid waste entering the sewer system. This includes video and TV
program and distribution of literature such as leaflets and brochures.
7.9.17 The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Cooperation (MARC) wvill establish and
implement formal programs for monitoring the quality of agricultural produce and
health of livestock located on the Varamin Plain. with set action procedures in the
event of deterioration in qualitv. It will review agricultural and irrigation practices on
the Varamin Plain in light of effluent and sludge reuse and develop education
programs (including advisory services) for the farmers on the Varamin Plain.
7.9.18 The TRWB and the DOE will evaluate groundwater resources and qualitv in the
Varamin Plain and develop legislation for controlling the quality of recharge to
groundwater.
7.10 Implementation Schedule and Cost estimates
7.10.1 The implementation of Environmental Management Plan (comprising of mitigation,
monitoring, and institutional building measures) would require an investment of
about US $2 million (US $1.5 million for additional treatment to control treated

8.1.1  The existing legislative and institutional framewvork has been described in section 4.
The intention of this review is to propose their reinforcement where necessary.
Policies and Plans
8.1.2  In order for the Government of Iran to formulate plans for the further development
of the City of Tehran. the formulation of appropriate national policies relating to
water supply and wastewater treatment and disposal would be beneficial. By
realisticallv elaborating on the goals of the Government. these policies would
indicate the direction of future development and wouid provide a framework for
relevant legislation.
8.1.3  In order to optimize the positive economic and environmental benefits of the project
and the sewage svstem protected from overloading, the requirements of the Tehran
Sewage Project will be incorporated into the next revision of the Urban Master Plan
for Tehran.
8.1.4  This Urban Master Plan will take account of proposed infrastructure development
including this project, the Metro system and other policy initiatives, and set out
areas for proposed development and redevelopment. It will also establish buffer
zones around the proposed STP and other associated facilities.
Legislation
8.1.5  While there is a bodv of legislation bearing on the construction and operation of the
project. it is essential that this is comprehensive and that all environmental aspects of
the project are properly addressed. Areas to be included are: sewage collection and
treatment and the tariffs attached thereto: construction control; waste disposal;
surface water pollution; groundwater pollution. trade effluent discharges; agricultural
usage of treated sewage and sludge; and occupational health and safety.
8.1.6  All existing legislation has been reviewed and an institutional strengthening program
has been planned to achieve appropriate institutional support. In addition to this, it is
recommended that encompassing legislation, or a Consolidation Act be developed by
the Govemment of Iran to link the existing legislation. Legislation governing the use
of sludge in agriculture will be developed by the Ministry of Agriculture, the
Ministrv of Health. and the DOE.
141



Standards
8.1.7. Properly managed, the use of standards will ease the detection and control of any
future pollution. as well as defining operational requirements for the Sewage
Treatment Plant and local industry. All standards relating to the project have been
reviewed and realistic and achievable targzets have been set. with due reference given
to the end use. These w ill be evaluated at regular intervals and modified as
appropriate. Additionai standards will also be developed to provide targets for areas
not currently covered. Standards will exist for the qualitv of potable water,
groundwater. surface water. trade effluent discharges. treated effluent and treated
sewage sludge.
Guidelines
8.1.8  The implementation of the project will create areas of uncertaintv for certain sectors
of the communitv. and the provision of guidelines will ease this in many cases. By
recommending procedures in the industrial sector for occupational health and safety,
housekeeping and the treatment and monitoring of wastes at source. and in the
agricultural sector for the application of treated effluent and sludge and health
practices. valuable assistance will be given in a supportive manner. The provision of
guidelines for the community in sanitation and public health would assist in a more
rapid transition to a cleaner environment overall. and will be a priority.
8.1.9  In addition to the project-related guidelines, it is advisable to reinforce the national
guidelines for environmental assessments in their progressive application in
evaluating project impacts. This will provide a framework for future monitoring of
impacts and allows the project results to be evaluated.
8.2.   Overview of Responsibilities
8.2.1   There are many different aspects to the administration of the project and the
organization must be structured with minimal complexity and have    . htforward
lines of communication. It is also essential that the budget anu levei of authority
attached to each relevant department or unit truly reflect its resDonsibilities. The
proposed responsibilities of the various bodies involveu in the Tehrmn Sewerage
Project are shown in Table 8. 1.
8.2.2  The TSC is to be responsible for the implementation of the Tehran Sewerage Project,
that is the design of works, supervision of ce.1tractors. oneration of the STP and
ensuring that measures to mitigate adverse environrne- .i impacts are carried out. It
will regulate discharges to the sewerage system and charge for them. It will inform
the public on the use of the sewerage system. It is to establish a Project Management
Unit (PMU) to implement the project.
8.2.3  The DOE (Tehran Province) is to monitor the project impacts during the construction
and operation phases. It will set standards for effluent discharges to the sewerage
network from domestic and industrial sources. prohibiting those which exceed the
standards. It-will also monitor and regulate effluent and sludge from the STP.

8.2.4  The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Co-operation (MARC) is to supervise an(d
regulate the re-use of treated effluent and sludge on the Varamin Plain. It will
monitor crop qualitv and production. It will inform  the farmers about safe and
productive methods of re-use of effluent and sludoe from the STP.
8.2.5  The Ministrv of Health is to conduct an education campaign to inform the public
about general aspects of public health relating to sanitation. hvgiene. and pollution
and a mass chemotherapy campaign to reduce the incidence of helminthic diseases.
8.2.6  The TRWB is to be responsible for the monitorine. evaluation. and use of th:!
groundwater resources in the Varamin Plain.
8.3  Involvement of the TSC
8.3.1 The role of TSC is described in Section 4.2.
Project.Management Unit
8.3.2 The structure of the PMU will include the follovwing functions:
- Design and Procurement
To provide detailed design and contracts for the sewerage network. the STP, effluent
and sludge re-use facilities.
- Implementation
To ensure that the works are implemented satisfactorily, on schedule. and wvithin the
allocated budget.
- Environmental
To implement the Environmental Management Plan including the specific mitigative
measures and monitor for the parameters listed.
8.3.3 It is recognized that the PMU may perform the above activities itself or employ other
agencies to under-take them.
Operations
8.3.4 The Operations Division of the TSC is currently made up of seven departments.
8.3.5 The Sewerage Operations and Maintenance Department will be responsible for
operation of the sewerage network. A new Sewage Treatment Plant and Laboratories
Department will be established within the TSC Operations Division for operation of
the Southern STP and other STPs in Tehran. since there are many differences
between the operations of sewerage systems and sewage treatment plants. This will
also be responsible for operational monitoring of the STP as described in 7.7.
8.3.6 A new Trade Waste Department will also be established within TSC Operations
Division to fulfill the responsibilities for industrial discharge regulation described in
144



Section 7.6. This will monitor industrial dischar2es to the sewer network utilizing
either its own laboratories or those of the Sevwage Treatment Plants and Laboratories
Department. It will set charges for industrial customers and impose limits necessary
to protect the STP. Its staff will have the power to enter industrial premises
discharging to the sewer network. It will advise on suitable methods of pretreatment
of industrial wastewaters prior to discharze to sewer.
8.3.7  The existing Customer Services Department (also part of the TSC Operations
Division) will collect fees from domestic and industrial users of the sewerage
system.
8.4    Involvement of the DOE
8.4.1  The existing structure of the DOE and its responsibilities are described in Sections
4.2 and 4.3.
Environmental Prolection Guar(ds
8.4.2  The responsibilities of the Environmental Protection Guards are to be widened and it
is proposed that the division is strengthened. In particular. new sections will need to
be established to regulate disturbance due to construction (noise, vibration and dust)
and to monitor and regulate discharges from industrial sources. The industrial
pollution section will need to set up a database in order to regulate all industrial
sources and their connection to sewer, as described in Sections 7.6 and 7.7.
8.4.3  The Environmental Protection Guards will require appropriate authority and
adequate resources to be effective, the enforcing procedures must be clearly defined
with effective penalties in order to achieve a standardized approach that is consistent
throughout industry. The unit's role in licensins and monitoring discharges to the
environment will, however, be a co-operative one. with emphasis on close liaison
with industrv.
Laboratories
8.4.4  The project will bring about not only an increase in the workload of the Laboratories
section. but also a broadening of its scope. For this reason, the DOE may have to use
the laboratories of the Raazi Institute and the Soil and Water Institute in Tehran in
addition to its own. The DOE will conduct an assessment of the analytical
requirements of the Tehran Sewage Project as soon as possible, in order that facilities
can be expanded where necessary.
8.4.5  For the whole monitoring process to be effective. it is essential that independent
quality checks be made. Quality of results is an essential requirement and suitable
quality control procedures and checking of results will be included in the daily
operation of the laboratories as a matter of course. Suitable laboratories will be
reviewed with respect to their equipment needs and supplies, and developed
appropriately. All appropriate analyses must be available in Iran, with minimal
dependence placed on foreign laboratories.
145



Strategic Un7it of the DOE
8.4.6  It is recommended that the DOE develop and implement a Strategic Monitoring Plan
in order to assess the progress of the project. This is discussed in Section 9.0. The
DOE wvill also develop and review appropriate environmental standards and
regulations covering noise. disturbance. effluent discharges. re-use and other aspects
of the project. Since the Environmental Protection Guards' role is day-to-day
monitoring and enforcement of regulations. it is proposed that a separate Strategic
Unit be established within the DOE at the same level as the Environmental Protection
Guards. Its roie will be to formulate technical poiicy and perform strategic
monitoring.
8.5     Institutional Needs of the Ministrv of Agriculture and Rural Co-operation
8.5.1  It is recommended that the Ministrv of Agriculture and Rural Co-operation establish
a Varamin Plain Unit to manage irrigation water & sludge properly; to ensure the
technically correct and safe use of effluent and sludge; to monitor soil & produce;
and to provide advice to farmers in order to realize the full potential of the scheme.
The Unit could be formed from existing TRWB personnel responsible for the
management of the agricultural area. with additional staff. The general manager of
the Unit will be responsible for provision of the following services:
- Water supply management,
- Water quality monitoring;
- Scheme maintenance:
- Sludge supply and monitoring;

groups and obtain comments from  local non-governmental organizations. The
153



complaints about the present situation and concerns about the project were then
reviewed by the group.
10.2.2 The non-governmental organizations consulted were:
- the Farmers' Council:
- the Veterinary offices of Varamin and Rav towns:
-  independent agronomists;
-  environmental researchers; the Monthlv Farmer (Keshavarz) magazine:
- independent public health engineers:
- the National Iranian Oi l Company:
- independent experts in air. soil and water:
- the Co-operative Organization of Farmers in Varamin Area:
- the Islamic council of farmers in Shahr-e-Rev:
- owners of livestock in Varamin Plain: vegetable producers in Shahr-e-Rey;
- the local religious council for southern districts of Tehran:
-  the local council of farmers in Eshghabad and Chaleh Tarkhan: and
- various university professors and other experts.
Viewpoints of Non-Governmental Organizations
10.2.3 From the meetings which have been held to date. and the opinions collected from
various bodies and individuals, the views of Non-Governmental Organizations can be
emphasized as follows.
- The implementation of the sewerage project should commence as soon as
possible.
- The project has been promised by the Government. bu: irnt implemented, for
20 years.
- The standards of management. pipe laving. construction and monitoring
should be of the highest qualitv.
-  The need for institutional strengther    of all  ..ncies at the provincial
level.
-  The need for institutional strengthening oG the new water and sewage
companies.
- The need for proper envirom.'.iental ' ..agement of the project.
- The need for more action rather :..an continued endless. exhaustive study and
hesitation.
- The need for inter-agencv co-ordination and training, education and public
awareness.
- Technology transfer is essential for training of staff at all levels.
Concerns of Farmers
10.2.4 Several meetings were held with farmers and agricultural organizations and the following
issues were discussed:
-  the improvement to the environment if the project were implemented:
154



the negative and positive impacts of usina treated sludge as a soil
conditioner.
the impacts of reuse of treated effluent on the Varamin Plain,
the positive impact of the project on the future water quality of the
Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals:
the recharge of groundwater in Varamin Plain and solution to the problem of
over-pumping:
the farmers awareness of possible water logging problems and how to use
sludge;
the awareness of children using the water from  irrigation canals for
recreation: and
the public hazard from children and livestock gaining access to polluted
canals and the need for mitigation measure to reduce these risks.
10.2.5 The views and concerns of farmers were recorded and assessed. They can be summarized as
follows:
- The farmers of Shahr-e-Rey emphasized the importance of treating
Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals.
- Farmers are concerned about heavy metal pollution of soil and crops leading
to the avoidance by consumers of crops grown in the area. To date,
mitigation measures such as using groundwater sources for irrigating
vegetable crops have not convinced consumers of their safety.
- The farmers insisted that the qualitv of effluent should be of acceptable
quality to protect their reputation.
- The farmers welcomed the reuse of treated sludge as a soil conditioner since
the sludges which some of them use at present from Firouzabad and Sorkhe
Hessar canals have produced good results.
- They are, however, concerned about the risks of using sludge, particularly
heiminthic diseases and toxic effects of heavy metals.
- Farmers of Shahr-e-Rev argue that the pollution of Firouzabad and Sorkhe
Hessar canals is not their fault, and believe that their ri ght to clean irrigation
water has been affected by the irresponsibilitv of the inhabitants of Tehran.
10.3 Other Consultations
103.1  The Environmental Assessment team have taken full advantage Of re.ecnt seminars and
symposia on environmental issues, pollution and water resources to address the public on
effects of the project.
10.3.2 The Second Intemational Conference on Environmental Planning and Management
(ICOEM-92) was held in Tehran from April 26 to 28. 1992. The audience were briefed on the
project. and the possible effects on the public, consumers and farmers of the present situation
of sewage disposal in Tehran. The lecture was given by Dr Imandel, a member of the
environmental assessment team.
10.3.3 A seminar on "Survey of the Water and Sewage in Big Cities of Iran" was held in Shiraz
from 13 to 14 May, 1992. and included a lecture on the project bv Engineer Maleki, a
consultant to the environmental assessment team.
155



10.3.4 In addition the TSC and Ray-Ab organized a campaian of public awareness via the mass
media which took place in July 1992. A film of present sewage disposal problems was shown
on TV, together with information on public health and the likelv impacts of the project. The
project has also been discussed in the radio program "Safetv in the Family", which has a
large, mainlv female. listeners.
Public consultations will continue throuohout the life of the project.
10.4 Public Participation
10.4.1 Numerous non-governmental organizations and independent experts were consulted over the
period Januarv to June 1992 and from 1999 onwards. The common view held was that the
Project should be implemented as soon as possible and without further protracted studies or
delays. A need was expressed for strengthening of the new water and sewage companies and all
agencies at provincial level. There was a concern that the Project should be managed in an
environmentallv acceptable wav and the need for inter-agencv coordination. training, public
awareness. high qualitv construction. monitoring. and good management was widely seen.
Recently held public meeting also confirned these views. Surveys of stakeholders including
affected residents, industries, and farmers have also been conducted and their suggestions
noted.
10.4.2 The farmers of Tehran and Varamin Plains emphasized the need to improve the surface water
qualitv in the canals of Tehran. the waters from which are used in agriculture despite their
contamination. They welcomed the use of treated sludge as a soil conditioner provided that
consumers of their crops are reassured of their safety.
10.4.3 Details of the Project have been presented at several recent conferences (including one in April
1999), seminars, and TV & radio campaigns of public awareness. Public consultation and
information campaigns will continue throughout the life of the Project.
10.4.4 The appendix presents a summary of discussions in a Public Meeting held recently in April
1999. The public meeting discussed the project objectives: project de..ription: alternatives to
the project and alternate design options available. major enI -mental issues and mitigatory
measures available; and feedback from the public. The ma:  reedback from r ie public was that
the project is urgently needed, it should be executed   in good qualitv  ..signs. govemment
agencies should coordinate with each other. and TS'. s capacitv snovlc! '  enhanced to meet the
project needs. These suggestions have been noted and act:ons o01 them, planned.

11.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
11 1   The Tehran Sewerage Project will provide sewerage and sewage treatment for the city of
Tehran. a citv with a present population of about 8 million. Treated sewage effluent and
sludge from the proposed sewage treatment plants will be utilized in agriculture.
11.2   Once operational. most of the impacts of the project will be positive. The Project will cause a
significant improvement in the chemical. biological and microbiological qualitv of pollutecl
surface waters in Tehran. This will lead to considerable public health benefits for the
population of Tehran. in particular a reduction in the incidences of water-related diseases,
There will be consequent benefits to amenitv. the indigenous people south of Tehran usint;
polluted surface waters and the Kavir Protected Area through which these waters eventually
flow. The project will be accompanied bv a hvgiene education program.
I 1.3   The discontinuation of the use of sewage wells will prevent the contamination of groundwater
with nitrates and micro-organisms. Groundwater levels within the citv are expected to fall
reducing damage to buildings and services.
11 .4   The use of treated effluent and sludge for agriculture in the Varamin Plain will lead to
increased crop production. a reduction in dependence on artificial fertilizers and a more
assured supply of irrigation water. allowing an expansion of the cropped area from 35,000 to
50,000 hectares. Competition for water with demands for potable water for Tehran will also
be eased.
11.5   Any potentially adverse impacts from  the use of treated effluent for agriculture and
groundwater recharge will be mitigated by the setting up of a formalized. efficient and regular
monitoring program to check effluent and sludge quality. There is a possibility, given the
proposed sl,udge use application. that EU limit values for sludge use in agriculture for
cadmium may be exceeded. Sources of cadmium within the city will be identified and
quantified bv the DOE. Once identified. action will be taken to relocate these out of Tehran,
or to ensure that their production of waste cadmium is separated out or minimized.
11.6   No data are available for existing heavy metal concentrations in the Varamin soils or possible
reductions in heavy metals discharges due to the planned relocation of industry. Programs
will be established for the monitoring of these to enable the formulation of a safe sludge
re-use strategy. The sludge will also, be subject to a quality monitoring program, and its use
restricted to cereal and cotton crops.
11.7   Recharge of groundwaters on the Varamin Plain will increase resources, redressing the water

in the quality of Varamin Plain groundwater.
11.8  In comparison with the positive environmental impacts, the negative environmental impacts
will be small and of concern mostly during the construction phase of the project. Adverse
impacts during construction are likely to be those of traffic congestion and disturbance to the
general public. Noise and vibration from construction activities will effect people and
sensitive buildings, although these w ill only be temporary effects. The extent of these adverse
impacts will be minimized by the implementation of effective mitigation measures. presented
157



in this report. The project will have a positive impact on emplovment. resulting from, the
increased construction activities.
11.9   The general disruption durina construction will be mitigated bv co-ordinated planning of
construction activities involving the transport authorities. the police, and electricity,
telephone. gas and water supply authorities at an earlv stage. The other adverse impacts
during the construction phase. namely noise. vibration. and dust will be mitigated by the
careful design of the Project and adoption of good working practices. The contract documents
wvill include requirements for measures to minimize disturbance from construction activities.
A procedure will be established to allow the general public to complain to the Project
Management Unit about excessive disturbance due to construction.
11.10  The contractor will provide suitable and reliable equipment for the construction of the project,
with a formal maintenance program established to ensure efficient operations. The TSC will
develop and establish suitable procedures for the operation and maintenance of the Sewage
Treatment Plant. and its employees trained in them. Training in emergencv procedures and
occupational health & safetv will be provided for all emplovees of the contractor and the
TSC. Suitable safety equipment will also be provided.
11.11  The TSC will provide secure fencing along the first 2 km of the Tehran Canal to protect
public health in case dis-infection is incomplete.
11.12  The activated sludge process is capable of reducing the concentration of intestinal nematode
parasite eggs to less than 1% of the concentration in the raw sewage entering the system. A
UYNDP mission has indicated that based on analyses of sewage from a restricted area of
Tehran. the process proposed is capable of producing an effluent which will comply with the
WHO guidelines for intestinal nematode eggs in effluent to be used in irrigation. However,
there is a lack of data to support this, specifically related to the proposed Sewage Treatment
Plant. From the outset of operation, a program of monitoring of effluent egg concentrations
will be instituted. The TSC will then review the data and plant operation. Additional treatment
will be added (if required) to ensure compliance with the WHO guidelines.
11.13  The Environmental Protection Guards of the DOE will establish and implement formal
programs for the monitoring of discharges to the environment from the Sewage Treatment
Plant and industry, treated sludges, surface water quality, and soil quality in the Varamin
Plain. with set procedures in the event of non-compliance with standards. It will develop a
system of controls on discharges into the Firouzabad and Sorkhe Hessar canals. The DOE
will review and develop legislation and standards for the control of industrial discharges to
the environment and implement monitoring procedures and licensing of discharges. There is

past and a lack of recent monitoring. Arsenic will be monitored by the DOE as part of the
above program until its absence is demonstrated.
11.14  The TSC will establish and implement formal programs for the monitoring of raw sewage,
operational parameters, treated effluent and sludge at the Sewage Treatment Plant and
industrial discharges to the sewerage network. The TSC will develop education programs and
advisorv services for the industrial sector with the DOE. The Operations Division of the TSC
will establish two new Departments: Sewage Treatment Plants and Laboratories for operation
158



and maintenance of sewage treatment plants: and Trade Waste to deal with industrial
discharges to sewer.
11.15  The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Co-operation will establish a Varamin Plain Unit to
implement formal programs for the monitoring of qualitv and quantitv of agricultural produce
and the health of livestock located on the Varamin Plain. with set procedures in the event of
deterioration. It will review agricultural and irrigation practices on the Varamin Plain in the
light of effluent and sludge re-use and develop education programs & advisory services fcr
the farners on the Varamin Plain.
11.16   A Tehran Sewage Project Liaison Committee is to be established to allow  liaison ani
co-ordination betveen the PMU. the TSC, the DOE. the Varamin Plain Unit. the municipality,
various  ministries. transport authorities, and  electricitv  &   gas  supply  services.
Sub-committees will deal with planning, agriculture, working conditions. public health, andI
industry.
11.17  No relocation of people is expected to be necessary for the construction of the Project.
Indigenous peoples, will not be adversely affected. The Project is not expected to have
adverse impacts on the economy: cultural sites: the biological environment: air pollution.;
climate: or other development projects.
11.18   The option of continuing with current methods of sewage disposal in Tehran has also been
considered. Although this option would avoid the adverse temporary construction impacts of
a piped sewerage system, this option is rejected on the grounds of both economic cost and
adverse long term environmental impacts. The NPV of the proposed Project is estimated at:
592 billion Rials, taking into account charges to the public for sewerage and sewage treatment
and charges to farmers for treated effluent and sludge. The NPV of not implementing the
Project is estimated at 709 billion Rials, due to the costs of provision of new sewage wells;
provision of local sewage treatment plants where sewage wells cannot be used due to adverse
ground conditions; pumping to reduce groundwater levels: lost working days due tco
water-related diseases; medicines to combat intestinal parasites: the use of additional water
resources instead of treated effluent for irrigation, and the use of artificial fertilizers instead olf
treated sludge. This approach would also perpetuate the current pollution, flooding, andl
problems of water resources and public health.
11.19  The proposed treatment process and the others are described in the separate "Review of
Sewage Treatment Process Altematives" Report. Waste stabilization ponds and aeratedl
lagoons are rejected on the grounds of both economic cost and adverse environmental
impacts. The oxidation ditch process is rejected on the grounds of economic cost.
11.20  Measures to encourage lower domestic and industrial water consumption and waste
production will be implemented. particularlv bv use of realistic water supplv and industria.l
discharge tariffs. This altemative would have environmental, and possibly economics
benefits, but would not negate the need for the Stage I Southern Sewage Treatment Plant. II-
successful, this could allow a revision of the Stage 2 requirements.
11.21   The overall conclusion to be drawn from this report is that the Tehran Sewerage Project should proceed
at the earliest possible opportunity. providing relief for the citizens of Tehran from the present
unsatisfactory sewage lisposal situation.

14.0        GGLOSSARY
14.1         Local Terms
Canal
Canal is a generic term used in Tehran to include open or enclosed channels
and watercourses conveying wastcwater and surface water. Somc canals
follow the routes of old watercourses but in these circumstances substantial
lengths have been regulanrzed and improved hydraulically.
Iube
Jubes are part of the traditional Iranian water distribution system and in areas
with no altemative water supply would normally comprise a comprehensive
network of interconnected channels capable of serving every property. In
Tcilran they are generally open channels, rectangular in section situated
adjacent to the carriageway and now perform the dual function of surface
water drainage and the supply of irrigation water to the trees lining the streets.
Qanat
Qanats provided the principal source of unpolluted water before the
construction of the potable water supply system.  Their construction, by
traditional methods extending back over 2,000 years. is in the form of a low
gradient tunnel excavated from the required point of use until the water table is
encountered  where a collection system  of horizontal shafts may be
constructed. The underground works can extend for several kilometres and
the penetration is normally sufficient to ensure that annual variations in water
table do not prevent the continuous supply of water.
Sewage welLs
Sewage wells are currently the most comrumon method of sewage disposal in
Tehran. These comprise a vertical shaft dug into the ground. at the bottom of
which is an enlarged chamber. Domestic and industrial wastewaters are
discharged into the wells, where the liquid portion evaporates or soaks away
while the solid portion accumulates and degrades in the well.

Dear Mr Shakibi
RE: TEHRAN SEWERAGE PROJECT
As promised, we have pleasure in submitting herewith the Environmental Assessment of
Proposed Sewerage Project and Effluent Re-use, Main Report.
We have, as requested, omitted references to concrete and vitrified clay factories and new
materials both from the Main Report and the Executive Summary.
We should mention that the project time scale of the Stage 1 Project (Section 2. I 1) and the
Management Plan of Mitigative Measures Programme (Table 7.1) both require updating in
line with your current proposals.
We hope this report is to T.W.S.C's satisfaction, and we hope to hear from you in due
course.
Yours sincerely,
,~~~~~~~~~~~ IC 4' L''
