MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO BURKINA FASO
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
1.        The  following  memorandum  and  recommendation  on  a   proposed
development credit to  Burkina Faso for US $ 42  million is submitted  for
approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years
maturity and would help finance the first phase of a long-term program
aimed at improving agricultural services to farmers and herders.
2.        Background.  With  a  per  capita  GNP of  $200  in  1987  and  a
population of  8.1 million,  Burkina Faso  is one  of the world's  poorest
countries and one of the most densely populated in the West African Sahel.
The population growth  rate is  estimated at 3.52  per annum.   Agriculture
employs 80-902 of the population, and accounts for about 402 of GDP and
almost all exports. Improved performance in the agricultural sector will
be crucial for future growth.
3.        The reorientation  of  traditional  agricultural  technology  and
animal  husbandry  practices  towards  greater  productivity  and  improved
protection of soils and grazing lands is a structural problem to be
addressed on a priority basis. Departing from the area-specific rural
development projects of the past, the Bank's present agricultural sector
strategy for Burkina, devised in collaboration with the Government, is
national in scope and focuses on support services and environmental
management. The proposed Agricultural Services Project has been prepared
on the basis of lessons learned during a pilot extension program undertaken
by the Government and financed by IDA over the past two years, as well as
on pilot programs in functional literacy.
4.        The  proposed  Project   would  complement  other   Bank-assisted
operations in Burkina Faso: the nationwide Agricultural Research Project
(Cr. 1896-BUR), which is the first phase of a long-term program aimed at
developing a unified national agricultural research capacity for crop,
livestock and forestry production and conservation, and the nationwide
Environmental Management Project (under preparation). The project also
reflects design principles agreed upon by Government and the Bank, namely:
(i) that technical assistance in general, and resident expatriates in
particular, should be minimized; and (ii) that upgrading the skills of
staff at all levels should have high priority.
5.        Rationale for  IDA  Involvement.  Agricultural  development,  the
heart of our strategy in Burkina, needs to be supported by a strong
national  producer-support  program.   IDA's  considerable  experience   in
agricultural  extension   has  made   a   valuable  contribution   to   the
above-mentioned pilot programs and will help Government to make a success
of the  proposed project.   It is  also important,  as area-specific  rural
development projects are phased out, that IDA be seen by the donor
community as fully committed to nationwide support services.



6.        Prolect ObJectives.  The project's three main objectives are: (i)
to improve t.ne effectiveness and impact of agricultural and livestock
extension  services  in  transferring   technology  to  farmers;  (ii)   to
strengthen animal health services and adaptive research programs; (iii) to
provide functional literacy training to farmers, thereby enhancing their
ability  to  participate  more   directly  in  technology  generation   and
dissemination.
7.        Project Description.  The project would seek to achieve the above
objectives by means of three main components dealing with:  i) agricultural
extension; (ii) livestock services;  and (iii) functional literacy.   These
components will be supported by strengthened monitoring units and a central
accounting and procurement unit to  be established under the project.   The
agricultural extension component includess the strengthening of nationwide
extension;   training   for   staff   at   all   levels;   improvement   of
research/extension links by strengthening the adaptive research units; and
improving mass communication and audio-visual systems in. support of
extension. The livestock services component includes the strengthening of
nationwide  livestock   services;  improved   distribution  of   veterinary
supplies, drugs and animal feeds; and the training of staff at all levels.
The functional literacy component will support the young farmers' training
and adult  functional literacy  programs of  the MACPs   existing  training
centers will be rehabilitated and equipped, and some support will also be
provided  to  the  Ministry.   The  project  would  financet civil  works,
principally the conctruction of 400 staff houses, 9 adaptive research
centers, 100 vacciuation yards, 42 livestock posts, and renovation of some
facilities; purchase of vehicles, motorcycles and mobylettes, and office
and  laboratory   equipment;  staff   training;  some   additional   staff,
principally for monitoring and evaluation, accounting and procurement;
studies of credit, input supply and marketing, and pilot operations in the
provision of such other support services; short-term technical assistance;
and operating costs.   The total cost  of the project  is estimated at  US$
44.9 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US $ 16.9
million (37Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.   Amounts  and  methods of  procurement  and  the  disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Burkina are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report dated December 8, 1988 is also
attached.
8.        Actions Agreed Upon.  In addition to the usual covenants, it  was
agreed during negotiations that Government will: (a) not later than
September 30, 1989, exchange views with the Association on the cost
structure  applicable  to  the  distribution  of  veterinary  products   to
livestock owners by the CRPAs; (b) not later than December 31, 1989,
prepare and furnish to the Association, for its review and comments, a
draft Protocole d'Accord, to be entered into between ONAVET and the CRPAs,
spelling out their respective obligations to carry out the distribution of
veterinary products, including, inter alia, the payment by ONAVET to the
CRPAs of at least 502 of the retail price margin on the veterinary products
effectively distributed; (c) not later than March 31, 1990, take all
measures necessary to finalize said Protocole d'Accord, including the



recommendations made by the Association; (d) prepare and furnish to IDA for
its review and comments a draft detailed first-year staff training program
for MAE and MACP staff by September 30. 1989 and, not later than May 31 of
each year thereafter, a detailed training program for the following year;
(e) take all measures necessary to ensure that all staff having received
project-financed training abroad remain in their assignments at least until
a  suitable   replacement   is   appointed;  and   (f)   undertake   annual
implementation reviews and a mid-term review with IDA, and promptly
thereafter  implement  the  findings   of  such  reviews.   Conditions   of
Effectiveness would includes (a) the obtaining of land use rights for land
to be occupied by the Project; and (b) the establishment of legally binding
agreements  between   the   various  directorates   involved   in   Project
implementation.
9.        Benefits.  The  main benefits  would be  (a) increased  crop  and
livestock output, arising from improved land and animal productivity in the
more densely populated areas, and from improved labor productivity in less
densely settled areas; (b) more sustainable farming systems as recently
introduced practices become more widely adopted; (c) training of a large
number of farmers, herders and staff in management and communications
skills as well as technical matters, whereby new techniques will be more
effectively identified, tested and transmitted.
10.       Risks.  These are:  (a) the possible  inability of extension  and
research services to produce workable solutions to farmers' and herders'
problems; (b) problems of inter-agency coordination; and (c) the possible
failure of Government andlor donors to sustain the long-term commitment
required  to  achieve   durable  improvements  in   the  effectiveness   of
agricultural services. To minimize these risks, a two-year pilot operation
was undertaken and the lessons have been built into project design.
Inter-agency coordination has been simplified between the departments of
MAE  and  MACP,  where  financial  and  management  capabilities  will   be
strengthened.  Annual reviews  of work plans  and budgets, as  well as  the
mid-term implementation review, will provide good opportunities for program
review and long-term commitment building. In addition, a Bank staff member
has been assigned to the Resident Mission for the first three years of the
Project for the specific purpose of advising on its implementation.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied  that the proposed Project  would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
