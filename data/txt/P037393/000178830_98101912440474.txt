APPRAISAL OF ThE SIGALDA HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
OF LANDSVIRKJUN (THE NATIONAL POWER COMPANY)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a Project for the construction of the Sigalda
hydroelectric power station and associated transmission in southwest Iceland
at an estimated cost of US$56.4 million (including contingencies), of which
US$39.1 million is for civil works, US$14.3 million for electrical and mechan-
ical equipment and US$2.9 million for transmission. A Bank loan of US$10 mil-
lion is proposed towards the foreign exchange costs of the civil works and
consultants' services totalling US$22.7 million out of the total foreign ex-
change costs of US$35.5 million.
ii.       The power sector has a key role to play in the Icelandic economy,
since Government efforts to diversify economic activity and exports depend
mainly on the development of power-intensive industries utilizing the coun-
try's abundant hydropower resources. In addition to meeting normal load
growth in southwest Iceland, where over 70% of the national population re-
side, the Project would make additional power available for existing and
possible new power-intensive industries.
iii.      The Project would form part of the interconnected power system in
southwest Iceland which accounts for nearly 90% of the electrical demand and
which is operated by the National Power Company (NPC). Electricity consump-
tion in the NPC service area has been growing at nearly 14% p.a. over the
last ten years. This relatively high growth rate reflects the establishment
of an aluminum smelter in 1969, which by 1972 accounted for over 50% of NPC
sales. The growth rate is expected to be at least 10% p.a. over the next
five years and additional generating capacity will be needed by the end of
1976 to meet this growth. The growth rate could be appreciably higher if
new power-intensive industries are attracted as a result of the Project.
The Project would provide two 50-MW units plus a 35-km double-circuit trans-
mission link to the interconnected system. The first unit would be installed
by October 1976 and the second by April 1977. This should meet the growth of
demand to 1979 when a third 50-MW unit (not part of the Project) would be
added at Sigalda.
iv.       Sigalda was selected as the next hydro development after detailed
studies of alternative sites by NPC and its consultants over a period of years.
Comparison with various alternative thermal developments indicates that it is
the least-cost means of meeting the forecast requirements at discount rates up
to 13.2%, which is above the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Iceland
of about 8%. The estimated economic return on the Project is 10.7%.
v.        The civil works contract has been awarded in accordance with the
Bank Guidelines for Procurement. The electrical and mechanical equipment
contract has also been awarded following evaluation of international tenders
with long-term financing.



vi.       There have been two previous Bank power loans in Iceland, the first
in 1951 (Loan No. 46-IC for US$2.45 million) for the construction of hydro-
electric facilities and the second in 1966 (Loan No. 466-IC for US$18 mil-
lion) for the Burfell hydroelectric project, which made possible the estab-
lishment of the aluminum smelting industry in Iceland. Both projects were
completed successfully and are operating satisfactorily.
vii.      The borrower would be NPC, a public utility established by law in
1965, which is owned 50:50 by the state and the city of Reykjavik. NPC is
well managed but there is room for improvement in the organization of the
sector as a whole, which is unduly fragmented at present. At the Bank's
suggestion the Government has agreed to continue and expand, with the as-
sistance of consultants, studies aimed at improving sector organization.
viii.     The Project comprises the bulk of NPC's 1973-77 construction pro-
gram, of which the proposed Bank loan would finance 14%, suppliers' credits
13%, other borrowings 54%, equity contributions 6%, and self-financing 13%.
The internal cash generation is rather low, despite a tariff increase of 20%
effective December 1, 1973 and three further increases of 10% each assumed
from June 1, 1974, May 1, 1975 and January 1, 1976, because 71% of NPC's sales
at present go to two industries (aluminum smelter (ISAL) 63% and fertilizer
plant 8%) on fixed tariffs operative till 1984, leaving only a comparatively
small residual market to support expansion of facilities. However, the level
of cash generation is acceptable considering NPC's high debt service obliga-
tions and the fact that Sigalda represents a large addition to its system.
The financing plan is dependent on NPC's ability to raise medium-term loans of
at Least US$13 million in 1973-76 to be repaid from bond issues totalling US$25
million in the period through 1977. The arrangements for raising the medium-
term loans are well under way. As regards the bond issues, NPC's investment
bankers have expressed confidence in their ability to sell bonds for these
amounts over the next three to four years in the prevailing market conditions.
Throughout the construction period, NPC will be short of cash, the yearly
internal cash generation being inadequate to meet the current debt service
obligations including repayments of medium-term finance in 1973, 1976 and 1977
and barely adequate in '1974 and 1975. During negotiations, Government agreed
to ensure that all necessary funds for the Project's timely completion would
be made available in the event of NPC's inability to raise them.
ix.       Loan 466-IC recuires NPC to earn a return of 8% on realistically
valued net fixed assets from 1973 onwards, a requirement which the company
will fa'l short of by about 2% in 1973. During negotiations, NPC agreed to
specific rates of return for the years 1974-77 ranging from 7% to 9.5% and 8%
thereafter. Tariff increases of 10% are considered necessary in 1974, 1975
and 1976 to achieve these rates of return. Government has also confirmed its
intention to continue and expand, with the assistance of consultants, its
studies of the existing structure of power tariffs in Iceland.
x.        Tn view of the agreements reached with the Government and NPC as
set forth in Section 8, the Project is suitable for a Bank loan to NPC of
US$10 million for a term of 25 years including a 4-year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF THE SIGALDA HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
OF LANDSVIRKJUN (NATIONAL POWER COMPANY)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises a Project comprising the Sigalda hydroelec-
tric development with two 50-MW units plus associated transmission to be con-
structed between mid-1973 and 1977 by Landsvirkjun (the National Power Com-
pany - NPC), a publicly owned utility set up in 1965. NPC operates the in-
terconnected system supplying bulk power in southwest Iceland. The estimated
cost of the Project is US$56.4 million equivalent. The proposed Bank loan of
US$10 million would cover 44% of the foreign exchange cost of the civil works
and consultants' services totalling US$22.7 million. NPC would be the borrower
and the Government of Iceland the guarantor.
1.02      The Project is the next major stage in NPC's development program.
In addition to meeting normal load growth in southwest Iceland, the Project
would furnish additional power required for the expansion of an existing
aluminum smelter and fertilizer plant. A third 50-MW unit would be added
later.
1.03      Following the completion of the Burfell project in 1969, NPC en-
gaged Electro-Watt Engineering Services Ltd. of Switzerland (EWI) as consul-
tants to prepare a feasibility report on the Sigalda development; the report
was submitted in February 1971. The same consultants were asked to prepare
bidding documents. NPC has kept the Bank informed of the Project from an
early stage and has asked the Bank to comment on technical matters. A Bank
preappraisal mission in October 1972 led to the present appraisal.
1.04      The Bank has made two previous power loans in Iceland as follows:
(a)  Loan 46-IC of US$2.45 million to the Government in 1951, re-
lent to two publicly owned utilities for construction of hydro-
electric facilities;
(b) Loan 466-IC of US$18 million in 1966 to NPC for construction of
the Burfell hydroelectric project.
Both these projects were completed successfully and are operating satisfac-
torily.
1.05      This report has been prepared by Messrs. T.B. Russell, I. Mathai
and H. Huang (consultant). It is based on information obtained by a Bank
mission consisting of Messrs. Russell, D.C. Jones and Huang, who visited
Iceland between January 16 and February 10, 1973, on further data obtained
by Mr. Jones on a second visit in April, 1973 and on information provided
by NPC and its consultants.



-2-
2   THE COUNTRY AND THE ECONOMY
The Country
2.01      Iceland is an island of volcanic origin on the North Atlantic
ridge close to the Arctic Circle. It has an area of about 103,000 km2, con-
sisting of a coastal plain and a central plateau 640 to 760 m high, ringed
by mountains rising to over 2,000 m, including active volcanoes. Although
there are numerous rivers and lakes, the country is mostly barren, only about
20% of the land area being suitable for agriculture or grazing. The climate
is milder than the northern location would suggest, owing to the influence
of the Gulf Stream.
The Economy
2.02      The structure and  development of the economy have been conditioned
by the relatively small population base and the limited natural resources.
The present population is about 211,000, roughly two-thirds urban and one-
third rural. The overall growth rate is about 1.2% p.a. but urban popula-
tion has been growing at 1.7% p.a. Average population density is only 2 per
km2, making Iceland the most sparsely populated country in Europe, with a
correspondingly limited domestic market and difficult communications. Over
70% of the population inhabits the southwestern region of the country, the
area served by NPC and the proposed Project. This region includes Reykjavik,
the capital, with a population of over 80,000. The active labor force totals
about 84,000 and is expected to reach nearly 100,000 by 1981. Unemployment,
now 0.5%, has been virtually non-existent for the last 25 years except during
1967-69, when it rose to 2.5% (1969 average).
2.03      Apart from its rich coastal fishing grounds and the grasslands which
support the livestock industry, Iceland's only significant natural resources
are its hydropower potential and geothermal energy sources (paras. 3.01-3.02).
It is the only country in Western Europe with untapped, relatively low-cost
hydropower reserves. There are no known mineral deposits of commercial sig-
nificance except for diatomite, used commercially as a filtration agent.
2.04      Fishing and agriculture (mainly sheep and dairy farming) have been
the traditional mainstays of the economy. Fish products account for 80% of
merchandise exports but this has made the economy vulnerable to the vagaries
of the fishing industry. Thus, GNP, which has grown at an average rate of
about 5% p.a. over the last 20 years (resulting in GNP per capita of US$2,652 1/
in 1972), actually declined in real terms in 1967 and 1968 largely because of
falls in fish revenues, while recurrent fishing booms have been a major factor
in continuous inflation, w'hich has averaged about 11% p.a. since 1950. In
recent years, therefore, the Government has made increasing efforts to diversify
the economy, particularly by encouraging the establishment of energy-intensive
industries to utilize the country's low-cost hydropower and geothermal resources.
1/   World Bank Atlas method.



-3-
As a result the share of agriculture and fishing (including fish processing)
in GNP fell from 27% in 1966 to 20% in 1971, while that of manufacturing rose
from 14% to 19%, reflecting largely the establishment of the aluminu- -e'_
ing industry in 1969. The Sigalda Project would provide power for a further
extension of the aluminum smelter, for increased fertilizer production and
also for possible new power-intensive industries, notably a ferro-silicon
plant (para. 6.02).
3. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
3.01      Iceland has large unexploited resources of hydropower and geothermal
energy. The technically exploitable hydropower reserves are estimated at
35,000 GWh under normal hydrological conditions, equivalent to 4,000 MW of
continuous capacity. About 18,000 GWh could be harnessed economically with-
out creating environmental problems. Only a fraction of this potential has
been developed to date. Total installed hydropower capacity is 364 MW, over
90% of it (336 MW) in the southwest region served by NPC. Hydro plants ac-
count for about 96% of total electricity supplies.
3.02      Estimated reserves of geothermal energy are roughly equal to the
hydro reserves on a heat equivalent basis. Exploitation to date has been
mainly for domestic heating and hot water, about 50% of the homes in Iceland
being supplied, including 95% in Reykjavik. Geothermal heat is also used for
small-scale commercial production of vegetables and fruit under glass. The
only industrial processing application to date is for the diatomite plant at
Lake Myvatn but research is being done on other possible industrial applica-
tions. A 2.6 MW pilot power plant in northern Iceland uses geothermal steam
but the feasibility of larger plants remains to be confirmed.
3.03      The only known fossil fuels are commercially unexploitable peat
and lignite deposits. All oil requirements are imported as refined products,
mostly from the USSR in barter exchange for fish products and textiles.
Organization of the Power Sector
3.04      The power industry in Iceland is governed by the Energy Law of 1967
(Law No. 58).  This created the National Energy Authority (NEA), whose func-
tions include advising the Minister responsible for power (presently the Min-
ister of Industry), basic investigations of energy resources, long term plan-
ning and coordination of the energy sector, inspection of power plants and
heating systems, and collection and publication of statistics.
3.05      The Law also reorganized the State Electric Power Works (RARIK),
whose main function is to promote electrification in rural areas. Operating
over the whole country, RARIK may generate power itself and purchase power
in bulk from other utilities for sale to other undertakings or directly to
individual consumers.



- 4-
3.06      The Law also established an Energy Fund, used mainly to finance
rural electrification (para. 3.13). The Fund's main sources of income are
state budget appropriations, including the proceeds of the price equaliza-
tion tax (para. 7.06), and RARIK's profits. The Fund makes loans or grants
to RARIK or other utilities for new power plants or systems and makes loans
to individual farmers for hydro or diesel plants for domestic use. It fi-
nances investigations of hydro resources by NEA and of geothermal resources
by NEA and others.
3.07      There are 26 electric utilities.  One (RARIK) is state-owned, two
(NPC and Laxarvirkjun, which is owned by the state and the City of Akureyri)
are under joint state-municipality ownership and 23 are owned by municipalities.
3.08      Most of the municipal utilities take bulk supply from NPC, Laxarvirkjun
or RARIK. The two most important are the power undertaking of Reykjavik, which
serves about 43,000 consumers with power purchased from NPC, and the power un-
dertaking of Akureyri, which buys power from Laxarvirkjun.
Existing Power Facilities
3.09      As of the end of 1972) there were 64 public utility power plants
in Iceland with a total installed capacity of 454 MW. 1972 energy genera-
tion was 1,768 GWh (96% hydro, 4% thermal). Details of capacity and genera-
tion are shown at Annex 1 and power plant locations on the map (Power Sta-
tions of Public Utilities).
3.10      Besides the public utility plants there are many small power in-
stallations owned by farms, schools, commercial undertakings and industries
with a total capacity of about 20 MW (hydro 16%, diesel 84%).
Growth of the Power Sector
3.11      Electricity production by public utilities in Iceland rose from
641 GWh in 1963 to 1,768 GWh in 1972, equivalent to an average annual growth
rate of 11.9%,, and installed capacity from 147 MW to 454 MW. Most of the
growth occurred in the last three years of the period following the start-
up in 1969 of the aluminum smelter operated by Icelandic Aluminium Company
Ltd. (ISAL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Swiss Aluminium Ltd. Excluding
smelter demand (771 GWIh in 1972), the average annual growth rate was only
5%. Production per capita rose from 3,456 kWh to 8,405 kWh (4,740 kWh ex-
cluding the smelter). Electricity generation in southwest Iceland rose from
76% of the national total in 1963 to 87% in 1972 as a result of the smelter
demand. Investments in the power sector during 1968-72 totalled tKr 6,808
million, about 11% of the national total.
Scope for North-South Interconnection
3.12      The load growth in the north, including tne country's second largest
city of Akureyri, has been about 11.6% p.a. There are 19 power plants with
a total capacity of 34 lw owned by Laxarvirkjun (65%), RARIK (19%) and munic-
ipal utilities (16%). Most of them will be interconnected in 1973. Because



of strong opposition by local salmon interests to a proposed hydro development,
load growth will probably have to be met by additional diesel installations
or by interconnection with the NPC system.  The NPC Act empowered Laxe':vii
to merge with NPC (see Annex 2). The merger has not been carried out, apparently
for political reasons. Extension of the NPC system to the north, with or with-
out the merger, would be beneficial to the country since the north would bene-
fit from the low cost hydroelectric generation in the southwest, and the addi-
tional load would make Sigalda even more economical.
Rural Electrification
3.13      All towns and villages have public electricity supply.  Under a pro-
gram launched in 1952 more than 4,000 farms (over 80% of the national total)
were connected to public electricity supply by 1971. The present program is
to connect nearly 800 more in the period 1972-74, including about 130 in the
southwest region. When this program is complete only about 160 farms, repre-
senting 0.3% of the population, will remain unconnected to the public supply.
Study of Power Sector Organization
3.14      Although Iceland has made impressive progress in the electrification
of the country, the power sector at present is unduly fragmented and there is
scope for rationalization to improve its effectiveness. Closer integration of
power generation, transmission and distribution under a single agency should
be practical and economic. This would reduce overall utility operating costs,
improve service to consumers (through more extensive interconnections) and
facilitate development planning of the sector. During negotiations the Gov-
ernment confirmed its intention to continue and expand, with the assistance
of consultants, studies currently being undertaken on the organization of the
power sector with a view to improvement.
4. THE BORROWER
Legislation
4.01      In accordance with Act No. 59 of May 20, 1965, the Government of
Iceland and the city of Reykjavik concluded an equal partnership agreement
on July 1, 1965 establishing NPC, which began operations on January 1, 1966.
Its main objects (see Annex 2) are to construct and operate generation and
transmission facilities and to sell power wholesale to municipal distribu-
tion systems and RARIK. With the permission of the responsible Minister it
may also sell power directly to industrial enterprises utilizing more than
100 GWh annually.
4.02      NPC acquired the assets and liabilities of the former Sogsvirkjunin,
a company jointly owned by the state and the city of Reykjavik, including
three hydro stations and a thermal station.



-6-
4.03      Subsequent legislation empowered NPC to develop the Tungnaa River,
a tributary of the Thjorsa, at Sigalda and Hrauneyjafoss and increased the
Government's capital contributions to NPC and the amount of the Government
guarantee for the Burfell and Tungnaa River projects.
4.04      NPC is exempt from paying import duties and sales taxes on materials,
equipment and machinery for authorized projects, and also from state income
tax, stamp tax, municipal tax and other charges.
Organization and Management
4.05      I'PC is an autonomous Government agency, governed by a Board of six
Directors and a Chairman, appointed for six-year terms (renewable). The Althing
(the Icelandic Parliament) and the City Council of Reykjavik each elect three
Directors. The Chairman is jointly appointed by the Government and the City
Council or, in the event of disagreement, by the Supreme Court. 1/ The pres-
ent Board is representative of the political and business community. The
present Chairman is concurrently Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland.
4.06      The Board has supreme authority for the operations of NPC, but must
obtain the approval of the Minister for constructing new power plants and main
transmission facilities and for concluding long-term contracts with large in-
dustrial enterprises. The Board is empowered to set wholesale tariffs, after
consultation with the Economic Institute, so as to obtain a reasonable return
on investment and earn an adequate surplus for supporting expansion. However,
under the present system of price controls introduced to restrain inflation,
Government approval is required for tariff revisions.
4.07      The Board appoints the General Manager of NPC and, on his recommenda-
tion, a Deputy General Manager and three heads of departments (Administration,
Engineering and Operations).
4.08     NNC is well managed and has an efficient staff consisting of about
70 permaaent employees. The present General Manager is an electrical engineer
with extensive administzative and engineering experience.  To assist the con-
sultants in the design and construction of the Project, NPC proposes to recruit
additional staff, as part of its training program.
Existing Facilities
4.09      The NPBC facilities consist of six power stations with a total capac-
ity of 383 MW, including the 240-MW Burfell station, which began operation in
1969.  Power is transmitted to the main Geithals substation in the Reykjavik
area through two single-circuit 220-kV lines completed respectively in 1969
and early 1973.
11   These arrangements would be changed in the event of a merger between
Laxarvirk.jun and NPC (see para. 3.12 and Annex 2).



- 7 -
4.10      NPC completed a storage project at Lake Thorisvatn in 1972.  The
water flow of the Kaldakvisl River is diverted by two dams and a canal into
the lake, as shown on the map (Southwest Interconnected System). A str-s-
capacity of 1,000 million m3 in the lake is available to regulate thL naLa,ra.
flow for the benefit of Burfell and later of Sigalda and other downstream
plants.
4.11      In addition to the above, there are five small power stations owned
by other organizations, totalling about 18 MW, connected to the southwest
power system.
4.12      Details of the power facilities are given in Annex 3 and their
location is shown on the map (Southwest Interconnected System).
Operations
4.13      NPC sells bulk power to the municipal undertakings of Reykjavik and
Hafnarfjordur. NPC also supplies power wholesale to RARIK, which in turn sells
in bulk to 12 municipal utilities in the southwest region and directly to the
NATO base at Keflavik. These three customers of NPC constitute the so-called
"iordinary market" for power. The Icelandic Aluminium Company Ltd. (ISAL) and
the state-owned fertilizer factory are the only two industrial enterprises to
which NPC supplies power directly.
4.14      In 1972 NPC generated 1,495 GWh (99.7% hydro) and sold 1,408 GWh..
In 1973 sales are expected to increase to 1,870 GWh, of which 29% would be
to the ordinary market (Reykjavik 16%, Hafnarflordur 2%, RARIK 11%) and 71%
direct to industry (ISAL 63%, fertilizer plant 8%).
Development Program
4.15      NPC's present development program calls for installation of two
50-MW units at Sigalda in 1976-77 and a third in 1979 (para. 5.10). NPC
tentatively plans to develop another downstream hydro site on the Tungnaa
River at Hrauneyjafoss with an ultimate installation of three 54-MW units.
Given the energy capability of Sigalda in relation to forecast load growth,
construction of the Hrauneyjafoss plant should be deferred until after the
installation of a fourth unit at Sigalda (which could be in 1982 -- see Annex
12), unless the load should grow faster than expected - with the materializa-
tion, for example, of the proposed ferro-silicon project (para. 6.02) or with
the addition of the northern market (para. 3.12).
4.16      The Thjorsa River system possesses half of the country's hydro po-
tential. According to preliminary studies ten major sites in addition to
Burfell and Sigalda, as shown on the map (Southwest Interconnected System),
could be developed to a total capacity of over 800 MW. Because of their
favorable location NPC plans to concentrate its further development efforts
on these sites for meeting its longer-term needs.

5. THE PROJECT
Deseription
5.01      The Project would comprise:
(a) the construction of the Sigalda hydroelectric scheme with
two 50-MW generating units;
(b) the construction of a 35-km long double-circuit 220-kV
transmission line from Sigalda to Burfell with associated
tie-in equipment; and
(c) the provision of consulting services for the above.
The Sigalda development is described in detail in Annex 4. It is located on
the Tungnaa River, a tributary of the Thjorsa River in southwest Iceland, and
is about 40 km upstream of Burfell. At the site the Tungnaa loops around a
rocky ridge in rapids and waterfalls with a drop of about 55 m which would
be harnessed by the development. The main features would consist of:
(a)  a rackfill dam with a maximum height of 44 m and crest
length of 1,050 m with upstream asphalt facing;
(b) a 1,020 m headrace canal;
(c) a surface powerhouse controlled from Burfell with two
50-MW units operating under about 70 m head, with provision
for a third; and
(d) a 550 m tailrace canal.
The dam and other structures have been designed with due consideration for
seismicity. With three units installed the Sigalda development will increase
the firm energy of the existing system by 750 GWh p.a. Power will be trans-
mitted to Burfell by the 35-km 220-kV line and thence fed into the existing
system.
Cost Estimate
5.02      A detailed cost estimate, with explanatory notes, for the Sigalda
development (three 50-MW units) is shown in Annex 5. The total construction
cost, covering the period to 1980, is estimated at US$68.5 million including
expenditures incurred up to the end of 1972 but excluding interest during
construction.
5.03      The bulk of the total construction cost would be incurred during
the period 1973-77 for the installation of the two units plus transmission
comprising the Project. The estitaated cost of the Project, also shown in
Annex 5, is US$56.4 million, as summarized below:

Engineering costs of US$4,525,000, including US$2,960,000 foreign costs, are
included in items (a), (b) and (c) above.
5.04      The costs of the civil works and the E & M equipment are based on
actual bid prices. Physical contingencies are 10% for civil and 5% for equip-
ment and transmission. Price contingencies on local costs are 16% p.a. for
civil and 11% p.a. for equipment and transmission. Price contingencies on
foreign costs are 4% for all items. High price contingency percentages on
local costs are adopted to cover possible inflation in Iceland during the
construction period.
Amount of Loan
5.05      The proposed Bank loan of US$10 million would cover about 47% of
the foreign exchange cost of the civil works excluding engineering (US$19.7
million 1/) and 25% of the foreign exchange cost of the consultants' services
(US$3 million), or 44% of the total (US$22.7 million). Suppliers' credits
of about US$8.8 million would finance 80% of the foreign exchange cost of
the E & M equipment excluding engineering (US$11 million). Other financing
requirements would be met as shown in paragraph 7.21.
Status of Engineering, Procurement and Disbursement
5.06      In 1970 and 1971, NPC engaged Electro-Watt Engineering Services Ltd.
of Switzerland (EWI) in association with Virkir H.F., an Icelandic consulting
firm, to submit a feasibility report on the Sigalda development and to prepare
1/   US$18,903,000 less US$1,874,000 for engineering plus $2,674,000 for
physical and price contingencies (see Annex 5).



- 10 -
the related bidding documents.  With the Bank's agreement NPC has appointed
the same consultants to make detailed designs and assist in the supervision
of construction work.
5.07      Bidding on the civil works followed the Bank Guidelines for Pro-
curement. International competitive tenders with long-term financing were
invited for the E & M equipment.  NPC will engage local consultants for the
transmission system, for which selected international bids will be invited.
5.08      The civil works' bidding documents were issued in September 1972
and tenders were received in April 1973. NPC awarded the contract to
Energoprojekt of Yugoslavia in July 1973 after review by the Bank. The
equipment contract was awarded to a consortium of Brown Boveri of Germany
and Energomachexport (USSR).
5.09      it is recommended that the proceeds of the proposed loan be dis-
bursed against 50% of the foreign exchange cost of the civil works contract
and 25% of the foreign exchange cost of consultants' services. Disbursements
are expected to be completed by December 1977 as shown in the Estimated
Schedule of Disbursements (Annex 6). There will be no retroactive financing
nor unallocated category. The above percentages will be adjusted in the final
disbursements so that the full amount of the loan is utilized. No savings are
therefore anticipated.
Construction Schedule
5.10      Civil construction work has begun in the fall of 1973.  No major
difficulties are foreseen and completion is expected in about three years.
The first unit would begin commercial operation by October 1976, ready to
meet the winter peak (November-December), and the second by April 1977.
According to the present loed projection the third unit would not be required
until 1979 and NPC has agreed during negotiations to exercise its option to
uefer del ivery c.f this unit to not earlier than October 1, 1979 unless the
Bank agrees otherwise. Work on the transmission system would be phased to
fit in ;K'ith che above schedule.
Project Maintenance
5.11      NPC has agreed during negotiations to engage experienced consultants
to assist its staff in preparing maintenance programs for the dam, reservoir
and '.aterways of the Project and of the Burfell project respectively. 1/
These programs should specify the detailed items to be checked on periodic
inspections. NPC will prepare the programs not later than one year prior to
the expected completion of the Project and will submit them to the Bank for
review and approval.. NPC proposes to engage EWI and Harza Engineering Company
International for these tasks.
1/   The small cost involved has been included in the cost estimates for the
Project.



- 11 -
Ecological Aspects
5.12      As required by Icelandic law the Iceland Conservation Council has
reviewed the environmental impact of the Project and has confirmed that there
are no objections on ecological grounds (see Annex 7). The site is in a re-
mote, uninhabited part of the country, where the land to be flooded is un-
suitable for farming, and does not include any sites or areas of conservation
interest. There are no traditional fishing rights in the area with which
the proposed dam and reservoir might interfere. Conservation interests and
natural resources downstream of the Project would not be adversely affected.
The short transmission line to link Sigalda and Burfell passes through un-
inhabited country where amenity considerations are minimal.
6. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Market Growth
6.01      The Project would form part of NPC's interconnected system serving
southwest Iceland. This area contains about 70% of the total population and
accounts for nearly 90% of total electricity production. It includes the
capital, Reykjavik, where most of the commercial and industrial development
of the country is concentrated. Two major power-intensive industries, alumi-
num smelting and fertilizer production, are located in this area. The aver-
age annual growth rate of electricity sales in the system since 1963 has been
about 13.7%. Excluding sales to the two power-intensive industries the growth
rate has been 5.4%. The detailed figures by consumer category are shown in
Annex 8, together with the corresponding trend in generation. The trend of
maximum demand is shown in Annex 9.
6.02      For forecasting purposes NPC analyzed the power market into (a) the
ordinary market, comprising bulk sales to the two distribution undertakings
(Reykjavik and Hafnarfjordur) and to RARIK; (b) the power-intensive indus-
tries; and (c) the new domestic space heating market which it is intended
to promote. The NPC forecast implied an average growth rate for the ordi-
nary market of 6.5% p.a. and additional requirements, commencing in 1977,
of 160 Xl (half firm, half interruptible) for the aluminum smelter and 40
GWh for the fertilizer plant. A market survey indicated an additional space
heating market of 35 GWh in 1976 rising to 280 GWh in 1983. After reviewing
this NPC projection the mission made its own forecast, as shown in Annex 10.
This resulted in a slightly slower growth rate than in the NPC forecast but
confirmed the need for additional capacity in 1976. To allow for uncertainty
a "high" and a "low" forecast were also made. The main feature of the "high"
forecast was the inclusion of a large additional power-intensive load for a
proposed ferro-silicon plant (see Annex 11), the prospects for which look
promising.



- 12 -
Comparison of Alternatives
6.03      Studies of alternative hydro sites by NPC and its consultants led
to the conclusion that Sigalda would be the best hydro development, partly
because it would reduce icing problems at Burfell, thus improving the relia-
bility of that station under severe weather conditions.
6.04      The adopted unit size of 50 MW for the Project represents about 10%
of the total system capacity after Project completion and fits in well with
the demand growth.
6.05      To confirm that Sigalda was the least-cost solution, four alterna-
tive programs based on the installation of different types of thermal genera-
tion units were compared with the proposed program. On the main demand fore-
cast, the equalizing discount rates were found to range from 13.2% to 17.1%,
indicating that the proposed program with the Sigalda development would be
more economic than any of the four thermal alternatives for discount rates
up to at least 13.2% (see Annex 12 for details).
6.06      The sensitivity of the equalizing discount rate of 13.2% between
Sigalda and the best thermal alternative (4 x 25-MW gas-turbines and 2 x 50-MW
steam-turbines) was tested for variations in the assumptions regarding market
growth, capital costs and fuel costs. As shown in Annex 12, this resulted in
an upper limit of 23.7% and a lower limit (if all the less favorable assump-
tions are combined) of 9.4%, which is still above the estimated opportunity
cost of capital in Iceland of about 8%.
Economic Rate of Return
6.07      The economic rate of return on the Project is estimated to be at
least 10.7% (see Annex 13). The quantified benefits consist of attributable
NPC revenues (including sales tax) from incremental sales to the ordinary
market and power-intensive industries; net benefits from additional sales of
electricity for domestic space heating, compared with the alternative of oil-
fired heating; extra taxes payable by ISAL; extra revenue from the shipment by
Icelandic vessels of raw materials and finished aluminum on behalf of ISAL;
extra wages earned by the additional workers employed by ISAL compared with
what they could earn in alternative employment; and the savings in power sys-
tem operating costs through reduced icing at Burfell station when Sigaida is
in operation. The estimated rate of return of 10.7% understates the true re-
turn to the economy since it takes no account of unquantifiable benefits, such
as the reduction of air pollution resulting from the substitution of hydro-
electric space heating for oil-fired heating.
6.08      Sensitivity tests (see Annex 13) indicated that the rate of return
is relatively insensitive to individual changes in the values assumed for the
main variables (load growth, capital costs, tariffs and oil price). Even if
all the less favorable variations are combined, an unlikely contingency, the
rate remains above 8%, and it is nearly 14% if the more favorable assumptions
are taken together.

7. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Tariffs
7,01      Under the existing law and regulations, NPC fixes its tariffs to
cover amortization in excess of depreciation and interest on its own funds,
secure a reasonable return on capital and provide runds for expansion. NPC's
autonomous power to set tariffs is currently inoperative because of general
price controls requiring government approval for all price increases. Under
Loan 466-IC, NPC is required to fix tariffs at a level which will provide a
return of 3% from 1973 on realistically valued fixed assets in operation at
the beginning of each year. Details of existing tariffs are given in Annex 15.
7.02      Under a tripartite agreement between ISAL, NPC and Government, made
in 1966 when the Burfell project w'as under consideration, ISAL pays for supplies
to the aluminum smelter at 3.0 US mils per kWh until September 30, 1975 and at
2.5 US mils per kWh thereafter.  These charges fully cover present annual costs
of Burfell but are fixed for a 25-year period with provision for revision only
after 15 years to cover increases in operating expenses. The cost of new de-
velopment will therefore fall almost entirely upon consumers in the ordinary
market.
7.03      Simultaneously with the radouction of *zhe ISAL tariff from 3 US mils
per kWh to 2.5 US mils on October 1. 1975, the Government will, under the
agreement, increase its tax on ISAL's production by the equivalent of 0.5 US
mils/kWh i.e. the Government takes vwhat NPC loses.  NPC hopes to reach revised
agreement with ISAL and Government unider whichithe present price will continue.
During negotiations, Government and NPC agreed to seek revision, in collabora-
tion with Alusuisse, of the present agreement with ISAL.
7.04      Extension of ISAL's second potline by 40 pots, planned for 1977,
will require an additional 20 MW of power (part firm and part interruptible).
NPC has still to negotiate the price of this power but an average of 4 US
mils has been used in the financial forecasts and economic return calculations.
During negotiations, NPC confirmed its intention to negotiate a price from ISAL
which would give an adequate return and also to provide for future adjustments
in the light of increases in production costs or significant variations in
currency values. NPC also confirmed its intention to provide for such price
adjustments in any similar contracts in future.
7.05      The fertilizer plant has a contract with NTPC to take up to 185 GWI
p.a. at the same tariffs as apply to ISAL under the latter's existing contract.
7.06      NPC pays into the Energy Fund (para. 3.06) a price equalization tax
of IKr 383 per kW of power and IKr 0.01 per kWh of energy for financing rural
electrification. Efforts to have the tax removed have so far been unavailing.
During negotiations, NPC confirmed its intention to seek the repeal of, or
exemption from, the tax from January 1, 1974.



- 14 -
7.07      NPC raised its tariffs 20% on March 1, 1973, but Government ordered
a 2% reduction effective May 7, 1973 as part of an overall anti-inflation plan.
The forecasts assume four tariff increases, 20% from December 1, 1973 and 10%
each from June 1974, May 1975 and January 1976, which would enable NPC to earn
the rates of return agreed during negotiations for the Project period (8% in
1974, 9.5% in 1975, 8.5% in 1976 and 7% in 1977). Government has already
approved the 20% increase effective December 1, 1973. During negotiations
NPC confirmed its intention to revise tariffs periodically to take account
of the rising costs of supply and Government confirmed its recognition that
measures of this kind would be necessary for NPC to meet its obligations under
the proposed loan.
7.08      To make full use of the power which would be available from Sigalda,
NPC hopes to extend the market for electric space heating (para. 6.02) by
offering a promotional price of IKr 0.80/kWh, i.e. about 52% cheaper than
ordinary market tariffs.
7.09      The above highlights the need to extend the studies currently under
way of all existing power tariffs in Iceland (including retail tariffs). The
main objective of these studies is to devise tariffs which take into account
the costs of supply to the various categories of consumers and the financial
needs of the power utilities. During negotiations, Government confirmed its
intention to continue and expand its studies in this direction with the as-
sistance of consultants.
Accounts and Audit
7.10      NPC's accounting arrangements are adequate.  With only five con-
sumers, there are no billing or collection problems. The small finance de-
partment is efficiently run, and the annual financial statements are well
presented. The accounts are audited by an independent Icelandic firm of
accountants, which is satisfactory.
Past Operating Results
7.11      Since starting operations in January 1966, NPC's main activity has
been the construction of Burfell concurrently with the establishment, by ISAL,
of aluminum smelting facilities. During the latter part of 1972, both the
power and the smelter facilities came fully into operation.
7.12      During 1969-1972 the company managed to break even and added only
IKr 12.9 million to retained earnings. The return on fixed assets fell from
9.3% in 1969 to 4.2% in 1970 but rose to 6.3% in 1971 and 6.9% in 1972.
7.13      NPC began operations with very little cash working capital and has
been beset by cash shortages ever since, necessitating considerable resort
to bank overdrafts and short-term loans, e.g. IKr 24.7 million overdraft and
IKr 117.5 million short-term loan at the end of 1972. The cash position has
been aggravated by several factors. Firstly, costs have increased as a re-
sult of inflation of over 10% per annum, not matched by tariff increases.
Secondly, repeated devaluation of the Icelandic krona at about 7% annually



- 15 -
on average from January 1969 has resulted in higher debt service require-
ments, an acute problem when over 90% of the debt is in foreign currency.
Thirdly, with an average life of fixed assets of about 35 years and an
average term of loans of about 14 years, amortization of debt significantly
outstrips depreciation accruals.
7.14      NPC's income statement for 1972 is given in Annex 17 and its bal-
ance sheet as of December 31, 1972 in Annex 18.
Performance under Loan 466-IC
7.15      NPC is required to set tariffs so as to earn, from January 1, 1973,
an 8% minimum rate of return on fixed assets in operation at the beginning of
each year. With a view to achieving this, NPC raised its tariffs 20% on March
1, 1973 (since reduced by 2%) and has agreed to raise them another 20% from
December 1, 1973 (para. 7.07).
7.16      The fixed assets are required to be revalued from time to time to
take account of any changes in currency valuations or significant changes in
prices. Since January 1969, no such revaluations have taken place. External
debts have been periodically revalued to take account of currency devaluations
and the resulting loss included in the rate base, but this does not fully re-
flect a realistic revaluation of assets based on general price level changes
in the country. Based on a more realistic valuation of assets (paras. 7.19
and 7.20) and the proposed tariff increase, NPC is estimated to earn a return
of only 5.8% in 1973, below the required 8%. During negotiations NPC agreed
to specific rates of return for the years 1974-77 ranging from 7% to 9.5%,
which would make up the 1973 shortfall (para. 7.27).
Present Financial Position
7.17      Debts have been NPC's principal source of financing, as indicated
by the debt/equity ratio of 86/14 at the end of 1972. Its loans bear interest
rates varying from 2.5% to 9.5%.
7.18      NPC's fixed assets are substantially undervalued because of sig-
nificant increases in Icelandic prices in the past as reflected, among other
things, in several devaluations of the krona from IKr 43.00 to the US$ in
1966 to IKr 98.56 at the end of 1972. In 1967 and 1968, when the krona was
devalued, NPC adjusted its fixed assets in the same proportion as the deval-
uation, treating the excess of asset revaluation increase over the increase
in foreign debts (IKr 109 million) as revaluation surplus. Plant values were
increased by subsequent exchange losses; at the end of 1972 the total of such
increases amounted to IKr 984 million.
7.19      A tentative revaluation of assets as of January 1, 1973 has been
made during appraisal by revaluing local expenditure using annual coeffi-
cients based on the housebuilding index, while increasing foreign expendi-
ture, as already done by NPC, by the gross amount of devaluation loss at
the end of 1972.



- 16
7.20      This results in an increase in net asset values of IKr 1,312 mil-
lion 06%) over and above the adjustment made as at the end of 1972 (12%),
raising total net asset values at the end of 1972 to IKr 7,966 million.
'he rnethod, though not wholly satisfactory (e.g. the housebuilding index
does not reflect costs of plant and equipment), has been adopted for want
or a suitable index which fully reflects general price levei changes in the
country. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the above figure for
the revaluation of fixed assets in service, further adjusted for changes in
1373 in assets or currency values, to be used as a basis for determining
perforimance under the proposed earnings covenant for the locra   Agreement
v;oud be rea_hed in due course on a method for revaluing fized assets to take
account of changes in the future.

7.22      NPC's not cash generation amounts to 13% of capital  xpenditutes,
which, though low by normal standards, is acceptable considering NPC's high
debt service obligations and the fact that Sigalda represents a large addi-
tion to its system. Any significant increase in debt service obligations
through currency realignments or otherwise will have to be matched by tariff
increases or other measures so as to maintain self-financing at about this
level.  This will be watched through a semi-annual review of the earnings and
cash-flow position (para. 7.27).
7.23      The proposed IBRD loan is assumed to be for US$10.0 million at
7.25% for a term of 25 years with a 4-year grace period and will meet about
14% of the total construction requirements. A 20-year loan of about US$5.4
million equivalent at 8.t5% interest plus initial costs of 1.25% has already
been arranged from Banque Lambert of Belgium. Suppliers' credits of US$8.8
million equivalent (about 13% of construction requirements) bearing interest
at 3.5% and 7% and repayable in equal installments in 12 years from 1977 are
assured; so are Government subordinated loans of about US$7.5 million equiv-
alent (including unpaid interest at 8% accumulated with principal). The re-
maining borrowings of about $25 million, or 35% of total requirements in the
period, would be initially in the form of medium-term loans to a total of
US$13.0 million, assumed to be at 10% interest including initial costs, from
US banking or other sources, and from bond issues of US$25.0 million in 1976-
1977 at 9.5% interest plus issue expenses of 2.5%, out of which the medium-
term loans would be repaid. Medium-term loans of US$6.0 million will be re-
paid in 1976 and US$6.3 million in 1977, leaving a balance of only US$0.7
million to be repaid thereafter. The US$25.0 million bonds will be issued
either in the New York or Eurobond markets. Based on the advice of IJ.S.
and other banking circles,.NPC seems confident that it will be able to raise
funds of this magnitude. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that,
in the event of NPC's inability so to raise finances for the Project, the
Government would provide them to ensure the Project's timely completion.
7.24      Apart from earnings, the remaining capital finance is assumed to
come from equity contributions by the joint owners of NPC, the Republic of
Iceland and the city of Reykjavik, amounting to a total of IKr 350 million.
Total equity contributions in excess of IKr 350 million from either partner
requires a change in the law governing NPC. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that these capital contributions would be made available to NPC.
Assurances were also obtained that no dividends would be paid on capital con-
tributions nor interest on subordinated loans during the construction period
without the consent of the Bank.
7.25      NPC's financing plan could be adversely affected in the future in
the event of a realignment of currencies resulting in increases in NPC's debt
service obligations. As at the end of July 1973, realignment had been in
NPC's favor, an exchange gain of about IKr 18 million having accrued from
the position at end of 1972 mainly on account of the dollar devaluation
(from a commercial rate of IKr 97.90 to 11r 87,50 to the US$), but the posi-
tion remains fluid, About a third of NPC's debt is in deutsche mark and yen.

Future Earnings
7.26      Assuming tariff increases of 10Z from June 1, 1974, May 1, 1975, and
January 1, 1976, NPC would earn a return of 8.0% in 1974, 9.5% in 1975 and 8.5%
in 1976, which, in addition to making up the 1973 shortfall (para. 7.16), would
give an average 8% return in these years. In 1977, the return falls to 7.0%
because of the commissioning of Sigalda without simultaneous absorption of
capacity. It improves steadily thereafter to 7.7% in 1978, 8.7% in 1979
and 9.2% in 1980, reflecting increasing utilization of Sigalda's capacity.
Estimated income statements of NPC for 1973-80 are given in Annex 17. The
main assumptions underlying these income statements are given in Annex 14.
Proposed Rate of Return Covenant
7.27      The rate of return covenant under Loan 466-IC, which r-equires NPC
to earn from 1973 onward an 8% return on revalued assets at the beginning of
the year, would be replaced by a similar covenant covering the life of the
proposed loan for Sigalda but with the following changes:
(a) in the event of a shortfall in any year, beginning 1974,
the shortfall.will be made up in the next year;
(b) the return will be computed on the average of the net fixed
assets in service at the beginning and the end of the year
instead of the beginning of the year as at present;
tc) the return will be at least 8% in 1974, 9.5% in 1975, 8.5%
in 1976 and 8% thereafter except in 1977;
(d)  for 1977, the year in which the rate base fully reflects
the addition of the Sigalda assets, the return will be only
7% instead of 8%;
(e) NPC will conduct a semi-annual review of its earnings and
cash-flow position, once in March and again in September,
in order to ensure an adequate level of cash generation.
During negotiations, agreement was reached on this.
Future Financial Position
7.28      Through a steady accretion of earnings of IKr 2,657 million, aided
also by injection of equity investments of IKr 350 million, the debt/equity
ratio improves from 86/14 in 1972 to 62/38 in 1980.  However, because of heavy
debt service obligations, NPC will always have a rather precarious liquidity
,position, the current ratio staying at 0.3 to 0.4 in the period through 1977
and remaining below 1.0 through 1979. In 1980, the best year, it will be 1.4.
The yearly internal cash generation will cover only three-fourths the current
debt service obligations in 1973, 1976 and 1977; in 1974 and 1975 it will just
about cover them. This persistent cash shortage will be relieved somewhat
after the Project period. Estimated balance sheets of NPC as of the end of
1973-80 are given in Annex 18.



- 19 -
Debt Service Covenant
7.29      The present loan agreement limits NPC's right to borrow, other than
temporarily, without the Bank's consent unless its net cash earnings before
depreciation and interest exceed 1.5 times its debt service in any future year
including debt service on the amount to be borrowed. Although NPC has never
reached the ratio of 1.5, the Bank has hitherto approved requests for raising
additional loans. Even in the foreseeable future, probably in the next decade,
NPC will not achieve this debt service coverage. In order that NPC may raise
quickly the funds required for the project, it may be permitted to borrow in
the period through 1977 for the exclusive purpose of constructing the project
the amounts assumed in these financial forecasts namely, US$49.2 million
(equivalent) in the aggregate outstanding at any one time subject only to the
Bank's approval as to terms, and also bridging finance not exceeding US$1.0
million (equivalent) in the aggregate outstanding at any one time. A debt
limitation covenant similar to that included in Loan 466-IC would continue
for borrowings exceeding these limits and for all borrowings after the con-
struction period i.e. from 1978 onwards. During negotiations agreement was
reached on this.
Guarantee Agreement
7.30      Since NPC is limited in its authority to take decisions without
Government consent, Government agreed during negotiations to guarantee that
NPC would be enabled to meet all its financial obligatiorns under the Loan
Agreement.
8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RE:COMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations the Government confirmed its intention:
(a)  to continue and expand, with the assistance of consultants,
studies of the organization of the power sector with a view
to its improvement (para. 3.14);
(b)  to continue and expand, with the assistance of consultants,
studies of the structure of power tariffs in Iceiand (para. 7.09);
(c)  to make available to NPC additional finance in the form of a
subordinated loan (para. 7.23); and
(d)  to arrange for additional equity contributions. to NPC (para. 7.24).
8.02      During negotiations NPC agreed:
(a)  to exercise its option to defer delivery of the third generating
unit for Sigalda to a date not earlier than October 1, 1979,
unless the Bank agrees otherwise (para. 5.10);



- 20'-
(b) to prepare, with the assistance of consultants, maintenance
programs for the principal civil works of the Project and of
the Burfell project (para. 5.11);
(c) to revalue its assets as of December 31, 1973 on the agreed
basis and to revalue them thereafter realistically and in
accordance with sound and consistently maintained methods
acceptable to the Bank (para. 7.20);
(d) not to pay dividends on its capital or interest on its sub-
ordinated debt owing to the Government and/or the city of
Reykjavik during the period of construction without the Bank's
agreement (para. 7.24);
(e) to a revised rate of return covenant covering the term of the
proposed Sigalda loan to replace the existing covenant under
Loan 466-IC (para. 7.27); and
(f) to a revised debt limitation covenant to replace the one under
Loan 466-IC (para. 7.29).
8.03      During negotiations NPC confirmed its intention:
(a) to seek revision, in collaboration with the Government and
Alusuisse, of the present tariff structure under the Master
Agreement and Power Contract for the supply of power to ISAL
(para. 7.03);
(b) to negotiate with ISAL a rate for additional power providing
an adequate rate of return (para. 7.04);
(c) to obtain in future power sales contracts the purchasers'
agreement to price adjustments to offset cost increases and
currency fluctuations (para. 7.04); and
(d) to seek the repeal of, or exemption from liability under, the
price equalization tax with effect from January 1, 1974 (para.
7.06).
8.04      During negotiations, it was agreed that NPC's revaluation of its
assets as of December 31, 1973 would be a condition of loan effectiveness
(para. 7.20).
8.05      The Bank loan should be disbursed against 50% of the foreign ex-
change cost of the civil works contract and 25% of the foreign exchange cost
of consultants' services (para. 5.09).
8.06      In view of the above agreements, the Project is suitable for a
Bank loan to NPC of US$10 million for a term of 25 years, including a 4-year
grace period.

ANNEX 2
Page Iof 4
EXTRACTS FROM NPC
ACT AND REGULATIONS
The NPC Act (Act No. 59) was passed by the Althing (Parliament of
Iceland) on May 20, 1965. It has been amended twice: by Act No. 36 of May 7,
1969 and by Act No. 37 of April 16, 1971. The Regulations for NPC (Regulatidns
No. 115) were issued by the Minister responsible for electricity (then the Min,-
ister of Trade) on June 14, 1966 and amended on October 26, 1971.  The follow-
ing are abstracted from the English translations of these documents.
Ownership
The Government and the City Council of Reykjavik by a partnership
agreement established Landsvirkjun (National Power Company - NPC) as an in-
dependent legal entity, each owning one half of the Company.
Objects
The objects of NPC shall be:
1.   To construct and operate power facilities for public and
industrial use.
2.   To sell power wholesale to municipal utilities, the State
Electric Power Works (RARIK) and industrial enterprises in
so far as municipal utilities or RARIK do not act as inter-
mediaries in power sales to such enterprises.
3.  To carry out in collaboration with the National Energy Author-
ity (NEA) the planning of new generation and main transmission
facilities in the NPC supply area. (The Regulations stipulate
that NEA shall deal with basic investigations whereas NPC shall
determine the specific project site and carry out detailed

ICELAND
DESCRIPTION OF SIGALDA HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT
1.        After the completion of the Burfell project on the Thjorsa River,
NPC turned its attention particularly to the Sigalda site on the Tungnaa
River, a tributary of the Thjorsa. Its staff prepared a project planning
report in May 1969, which was reviewed by the Law Engineering Testing Com-
pany of USA in a comprehensive report dealing principally with the geologi-
cal aspects. in April 1970, NPC engaged Electro-Watt Engineering Services
Ltd. of Switzerland (EWI), in association with Virkir H.F. (Associated
Engineering Consultants Ltd.) of Iceland, to carry out a detailed feasibil-
ity study. A report was submitted to NPC in February 1971.
2.        The Sigalda development is located in the uninhabited interior of
southwest Iceland, about 50 km west of the Vatnajokull glacier, the largest
in Europe, and 40 km upstream from Burfell. At Sigalda the river has cut
a narrow canyon through a rocky ridge and forms a loop 4 km long.  Rapids
and waterfalls in the loop have a total drop of 55 m which would be harnessed
for power by the proposed project.
3.        The main components of the Project are a rock-fill dam, a headrace
canal, a surface powerhouse and a tailrace canal, briefly described below.
4.        The dan would be built at the head of the rapids where a prehis-
toric lake has left a flat bed some 5 km long and 3 km wide. The dam would
be about 1,050 m long with a maximum height of about 44 m and a total fill
volume of about 1.3 million m3. After intensive studies the consultants
recommended that an upstream asphalt concrete facing be adopted in prefer-
ence to other alternative arrangements. The dam will impound the Tungnaa
and restore the prehistoric lake to form a large reservoir. With the normal
operating level at 498 m elevation (limited by geological considerations),
the reservoir will have a surface area of 14.3 km2 and, with a maximum draw-
down of 13 m, a useful storage capacity of 142 million m3. The potential
leakage areas in the lake bottom would be properly sealed.
5.        The main appurtenant structures are a 560 m long concrete spillway
dam, a 110 m long ice-retaining boom and a 180 m long concrete bottom outlet.
The latter will be used for diverting the river flow during the last phase
of dam construction. It will also permit water discharge up to 260 msls for
ice flushing at Burfell and allow emptying of the reservoir if required.
6.        The large reservoir behind the Sigalda dam would cut down the ice
flow to Burfell and the stored water could be used to flush any ice formed
at Burfell, thus reducing the ice troubles which have been affecting this
station.



ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 2
7.        The headrace waterways would consist of a 400 m long concrete pipe
laid on the bottom of a deep-cut channel, followed by a 620 m long open canal
leading to the intake structure.
8.        The powerhouse would be built for installation of three vertical
Francis turbines, fed from three separate penstocks, operating under a rated
net head of 70.5 m and a rated speed of 200 rpm. It would be designed for
remote control from the Burfell powerhouse. Quick-closing emergency gates
would be installed at the intake structure, so the turbines would not be
provided with inlet valves. The three direct-connected 50 Hz generators would
each have a continuous rating of 63 MVA and an output of 50 MW at 0.8 power
factor. Three 63-MVA main transformers to be located on a bridge above the
tailrace canal would step up the generator voltage to 220 kV for transmis-
sion to Burfell. An outdoor switchyard would be located near the powerhouse.
Provisions would be made for extending the powerhouse to accommodate a fourth
unit in the future.
9.        A 550 m long tailrace canal would be dug to carry the discharge
from the turbines to the river.
2
10.       The Tungnaa catchment area above Sigalda is about 1,500 km . With
the Lake Thorisvatn storage project recently completed, the run-off of the
Kaldakvisl River is diverted to the Tungnaa, giving a total catchment area
at Sigalda of 2,950 km2. About one quarter of this is covered by glaciers
resulting in a relatively uniform flow throughout the year. According to
the operational research performed by NPC's local consultants, the annual
firm energy at Sigalda is estimated at 750 GWh and the average annual sec-
ondary energy at 200 GWh, on the basis of the expected load pattern. Thus,
for the proposed installation of 150 MH this gives a high plant factor of
72%.

EXPLANATORY NOTES ON SIGALDA DEVELOPMENT COST ESTIMATE
Direct Cost
Civil Works
1.        NPC has awarded the civil works contract to Energoprojekt of Yugo-
slavia. The contract price was arrived at by deducting from the tender price,
after correction of errors, the expected reduction due to quantity changes
resulting from design modifications. The direct cost is the contract price
minus the estimated refund of taxes and duties.
E & M Equipment
2.        The direct cost of the E & M equipment is based on the bid price
of the likely successful suppliers, minus the estimated refund of taxes and
duties.
Transmission System
3.        The direct cost of the transmission system is based on the original
consultants' estimate increased by 25%.
Engineering and Administration Cost
4.        The engineering and administration costs are estimated by NPC in
conjunction with its consultants. These costs are added to the direct costs
to arrive at the "base-line" costs.
Physical Contingencies
Civil Works
5.        The physical contingency allowance for the civil works is taken
to be 10% of the base-line cost. Since the contract price includes contin-
gency items (daywork) amounting to about 5% of the total, 10% is considered
adequate.
E & M Equipment and Transmission System
6.        A 5% allowance is adopted in each case.



ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 4
Price Contingencies on Local Currency Cost
Civil Works
7.        The original contract documents provide for escalation of local
currency cost in proportion to 50% of the increase in the local labor cost.
It was later agreed that this percentage should be changed to 80%. During
the recent years of fairly severe inflation the average annual rate of in-
crease in local labor costs has been about 22%. It is assumed that during
the construction period (1973-80) the rate of increase would be 20% p.a.
and therefore the price contingency allowance for the local currency
portion is taken to be 16% p.a. This percentage is applied to the sub-
total of the base-line cost and the physical contingencies.
E & M Equipment and Transmission System
8.        A 11% p.a. allowance is adopted in each case.  This is based on
the 50% adjustment stipulated in the contract documents and a 22% p.a. aver-
age increase in the applicable local labor rate.
Price Contingencies on Foreign Currency Cost
9.        The contract documents call for firm foreign currency prices with-
out allowing for any adjustment for increase in foreign labor or material
costs. However, in order to take care of the possibility that during the
construction period the Icelandic currency may be devalued or the foreign
currencies in the contract price may be revalued relative to US dollars,
a 4% price contingency allowance for the foreign currency portion is in-
cluded in the estimate.

EXTRACTS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT
1.        The following are the key sections of the Environmental Impact
Statement on the Sigalda Project issued by the Iceland Conservation Council
on April 16, 1973:
2.        "The intention of Landsvirkjun to commence the Sigalda Project
was brought to the attention of Iceland Conservation Council, as soon as
the public announcement to this effect appeared. On the Council's meeting
on the 29.1.73 the project was discussed and no objections were raised by
the Council's members.
3.        Further discussions took place on the 19.2.73 at a meeting of the
representatives of Landsvirkjun, the Ministry of Industries and the Council
respectively on the possible environmental effects of the Sigalda Project.
The basic concept of the power project was explained by the representatives
of Landsvirkjun.
Project's Environmental Impact:
4.        The main potential environmental impact relates to the elevation
of the water level which will flood approximately 13 sq. km of land. The
land to be flooded does not include any sites or areas of conservation in-
terest. The river itself is already relatively wide at the basic site. Of
the presently dry area more than half consists of barren gravelly flats.
The vegetated areas are predominantly of Rhacomitrium heath with Gramineae
and Carex ssp. and eroded land sparsely revegetated by Equisetum arvense.
Some Salix ssp. and Elymus arenarius are also found. To the best of
our knowledge the rangeland value of this area is negligible. Little is
known about the distribution of freshwater fish in the proposed impoundment
area, and no tradition of exploiting such resources exists in this location.
Claims for damages in relation to these interests, real or potential, have
not been considered by the Council.
5.        The principal changes in flow pattern due to the proposed impound-
ment, would be towards more even and steady flow downstream which should not
adversely affect conservation interests or natural resources downstream from
the project.
6.        In view of the above no major irreversible damage can be foreseen,
and the Council therefore confirms, that it has no objection to the Sigalda
Project."

Note:
1. From 1973-81 the MD's (maximum demands) of the Ordinary Market, the Fertilizer Plant and ISAL are estimated by
assuming annual load factors of 0.57, 0.85 and 0.95 respectively.                                                                                                                       s
2.  The MD's at plants are estimated by assuming NIC transmission losses of 6%.
3.  Surplus is covered mainly by the capacity of the existing thermal plants, (total 54 Wi).
4.  Sales to ISAL include 80 GWh of secondary energy in 1977-1981.

BASIS FOR THE FORECAST OF NPC ENERGY SALES
Ordinary Market
1.        NPC's three wholesale customers (city of Reykjavik, township of
Hafnarfjordur and RARIK) constitute the Ordinary Market. In forecasting
NPC energy sales to the Ordinary Market, their retail sales data for 1963-
1972, broken down into five categories (Household, Space Heating, Commerce,
Industry and Other), were compiled from NEA statistics (Annex 7), and aver-
age annual grawth rates of all categories during 1963-69 and during 1969-72
were determined. These rates served as a guide for assuming future trends
of increases in the major categories, except space heating discussed below,
as shown in the following table:
ASSUMED AVERAGE RATE OF INCREASE
IN RETAIL SALES 1973-85
Reykjavik     RARIK
Household                               6%          10%
Commerce                                8%           6%
Industry                               6%            5%
2.        After arriving at the total retail sales of each customer, NPC
bulk sales to this customer were obtained by estimating the distribution
losses of the latter's distribution system.
Space Heating
3.        The relative stagnation of the space heating market during the
1960s (see Annex 8) reflected mainly the fact that no real attempt was made
to promote this market because of energy shortages in the system for most
of the period. The situation will improve significantly when Sigalda is
in operation and NPC therefore intends, in conjunction with the retail dis-
tribution undertakings, to resume active promotion of electric space heating
to take advantage of this. A market survey carried out by NPC and its con-
sultants indicated that there was a large potential market amongst existing
users of oil for domestic central heating, accounting for about 18,000 houses
in the NPC service area. Of these it was estimated that about 4,000, which
were favorably located in relation to geothermal heat sources, would switch
to this form of heating when it became available. Of the remaining 14,000
houses it was estimated that at least 5,000 could be persuaded to adopt
electric heating over a period of years, given an effective promotion cam-
paign and adequate tariff incentives. Allowing for population growth and
new housing, a total market was identified of about 6,500 houses which, NPC



ANNEX 10
Page 3 of 3
assumed, could be saturated over 8 years, beginning in 1976. The total re-
quirement was estimated at 280 GWh in terms of NPC bulk sales, equivalent to
248 GWh of retail sales, and it was assumed that the market would grow by
35 GWh p.a. (31 GWh p.a. retail) in the period 1976-83.
Power-Intensive Industries
4.        Estimates of NPC sales to the fertilizer plant and the aluminum
smelter were furnished by these undertakings.

ALTERNATIVE SALES FORECASTS
1.        To allow for uncertainty two alternative projections were made,
resulting in a "high" and "low" forecast compared with the main forecast
given in Annex 10. The assumptions adopted for this purpose are described
below.
High Forecast
2.        For the high forecast it was assumed that:
(a)  the growth of the ordinary market in each of the forecast
years would be 10% above the rate implied by the main fore-
cast. This results in an average growth rate of 6.8% p.a.
over the period to 1985, compared with 6.2% p.a. in the
main forecast;
(b) the additional fertilizer plant requirement of 40 GWh would
commence in 1976 instead of 1977;
(c) a new power intensive industry would start operations in 1977.
The Icelandic Government has been investigating various pos-
sibilities for some years, including ferro-alloys, aluminum
casting, extraction of chemicals from the sea and heavy
water production. The most promising at present is a ferro-
silicon project in which Union Carbide (of USA) has expressed
its readiness to participate as a joint venture with the Gov-
ernment, subject to negotiation of satisfactory terms. There
is a reasonable prospect that this project could come to
fruition by the time Sigalda is in operation.   The power
requirements assumed here are 200 GWh p.a. of firm energy
plus 200 GWh of secondary energy, commencing in 1977. Accord-
ing to present indications, the average price payable for firm
and secondary energy would be 3.5 mils/kWh for the first two
years, rising in stages to 4.4 mils/kWh in 1983. There would
be provision for further price increases in subsequent years
but here it is assumed that the 1983 price would continue to
apply. The initial contract would be for twenty years, but
it is assumed that this would be renewed.
The same assumptions were made as for the main forecast regarding the require-
ments for ISAL and domestic space heating i.e. an extra 160 GWh (80 GWh firm)
for ISAL from 1977 and 35 GWh for space heating in 1976, rising by annual
increments of 35 GWh to a maximum of 280 GWh.



ANNEX I 1

Low Forecast
3.        For the low forecast the following less favorable assumptions were
used:
(a) a 10% lower annual growth rate of the ordinary market compared
with the main forecast;
(b) postponement of the additional.fertilizer plant requirement of
40 GWh from 1977 to 1978. This allows for the possibility of
slippage in the plant's expansion plans;
(c) a slower development of the space heating market, resulting in
a requirement of 30 GWh in 1976 (against 35 GWh) and an annual
increment of 30 GWh (instead of 35 GWh).
4.        The resulting-alternative demand forecasts are shown in the attached
table, together with the figures for the main forecast for comparison.

COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES
Choice of Hydro Development
1.        About half of Iceland's hydro power resources lie in the Thjorsa
River basin.. Over the years NPC has engaged consultants to make preliminary
surveys of these resources and has identified 12 major sites: 8 on the-main
stream including Burfell and 4 on its tributary Tungnaa River including
Sigalda. They are all within 150 km of the Reykjavik area with the bulk of
Iceland's population. Because of this favorable location, NPC plans to con-
centrate its effort on developing these sites to meet the country's power
needs.
2.        After the completion of Burfell, NPC turned its attention partic-
ularly to the Sigalda and Hrauneyjafoss sites on the Tungnaa River because
of the more favorable topography permitting the harnessing of greater heads
(73 m and 85 m respectively) and because of the possibility of utilizing the
regulated flow of the Kaldakvisl River through the Lake Thjorisvatn storage
project completed in 1972.
3.        In April 1970, NPC appointed EWI to carry out a feasibility study
of the Sigalda Project. At the same time it engaged Harza for a similar study
of the Hrauneyjafoss project. Both firms submitted reports in February 1971.
The two projects were found to be comparable technically and economically
and either could meet the requirements of the system growth. NPC prefers
to proceed with Sigalda as the next development because its larger reservoir 1/
would cut down the ice flow to Burfell more effectively and the stored water
could be used to flush any ice formed at Burfell, thus reducing the ice
troubles which have been affecting this station.
Optimum Installation at Sigalda
4.        Because of the relatively steady river flow and the upstream stor-
age, Sigalda would have a high annual energy output, estimated at 750 GWh
primary and 200 GWh secondary. The Project is designed for four units of
50 MW each but NPC's present plan is to install only three units leaving the
fourth unit to the future. In the mission's view NPC should install the
No. 4 unit before undertaking any major development such as Hrauneyjafoss,
as explained below.
1/ The Sigalda reservoir would have an area of 14.3 km2 and a storage ca-
pacity of 140 million m3 compared with 8.5 km2 and 41 million m3 for
the Hrauneyjafoss reservoir.



ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 18
5.        As shown in Table 4:  "Installation Schedules for Alternative
Programs", under the Main Forecast, additional capacity would be required
in 1982 to meet the demand and, as shown in Table 5: "Determination of
Thermal Energy Generation", the available hydro primary energy (2,870 GWh)
in 1982 would be appreciably greater than the requirement (2,792 GWh), in-
dicating no necessity for additional energy supply. Under this condition
the fourth unit, which can be installed at a very low cost, would be the most
logical means of supplying the needed capacity, even though it does not pro-
duce additional firm energy.
6.        For this reason, in order to give Sigalda its proper worth the
following least cost analysis provides for the installation of four 50 MW
units for comparison with thermal alternatives.
Thermal Alternatives
7.        To confirm that Sigalda was the least cost solution, four alterna-
tive programs based on the installation of different types of thermal generat-
ing units were compared with the Sigalda development.
8.        Gas-turbines of 25 MW and steam units of 50 MW were used.  Diesel
units have not been considered because only relatively small sizes of such
units (up to 7 MW) are at present available and larger units are still in
the experimental stage. 1/
9.        The five alternatives, including Sigalda, which have been studied
are as follows:
Alternative I             Sigalda              4 x 50 MW
Alternative II            Gas-turbines         8 x 25 MW
Alternative III           Steam                4 x 50 MW
Alternative IV            Gas-turbines (2 x 25 NW) + Steam (3 x 50 MW)
Alternative V             Gas-turbines (4 x 25 MW) + steam (2 x 50 DW)
Alternatives IV and V were considered worth investigating because the existing
system possesses quite adequate amounts of energy (2,120 GWh primary and 350
GWh secondary) and during the initial years only a relatively small amount of
thermal generation would be required, as shown in Table 5: "Determination
of Thermal Energy Generation", which could be met more economically by the
low-first-cost gas-turbines.
Installation Schedules for Alternative Programs
10.       One of the important criteria for the NPC development program is
to provide an adequate margin of reserve. At present there are two thermal
1/   The Taiwan Aluminum Corporation installed eight 11.5-MW medium-speed,
heavy-oil-burning diesel sets in 1972, the largest of their kind. The
operating record is too brief for reference and the costs are expected
to be high.



ANNEX 12

stations in the NPC system - one gas-turbine plant and one steam station -
with a total capacity of 54 MW. These high-cost stations should be kept as
cold standby. Any development program should provide the system with a firm
capability (i.e. total capability minus the capability of the largest unit)
which, without counting on the standby reserve, would be sufficient to meet
the forecast maximum demand. In other words, the firm capability, if the
standby reserve is included, should be greater than the forecast maximum
demand by an amount which is greater than the standby reserve. Under this
condition the system will have sufficient hydro reserve to meet the load in
the event of an outage of the largest unit without having to operate the
standby units. These would be called on to operate only when a double out-
age occurs, for example, when the largest unit goes out of commission during
the scheduled overhaul of another large unit.
11.       Installation schedules for alternative programs were based oti the
above principle and are shown in Table 5.
Assumptions
12.       Assumptions made for this analysis are sunmarized in Table 2.
13.       The energy figures are supplied by NPC from the results of opera-
tional research performed by consultants.
14.       Capital costs of civil works, E & M equipment and associated trans-
mission system for the Sigalda Project with three units are taken from Annex 5:
"Construction Cost of Sigalda Development", price contingencies being excluded.
Capital costs of gas-turbines and steam units are approximately 25% above the
estimated costs for Iceland at the beginning of 1973 before the US dollar de-
valuation. Fuel prices of light diesel oil (gas oil) for the gas-turbines
and heavy fuel oil for the steam plant are the current economic costs in
Iceland.
Results of Comparison
15.       On the main forecast, the Sigalda development (Alternative I) was
found to have the lowest present worth of costs amongst the five alternative
developments considered at discount rates up to 13.2% compared with the
estimated opportunity cost of capital of about 8% (see Annex 13). The equaliz-
ing discount rates between Sigalda and the other alternatives were found to
be as follows (see Tables 6-10 for cost and benefit streams):
Alternative I vs Alternative II           15.6Z
Alternative I vs Alternative III          17.1%
Alternative I vs Alternative IV           15.1%
Alternative I vs Alternative V            13.2%
Sigalda is, therefore, the least cost solution.



ANNEX 12
Page 4 of 18
16.       The comparison also showed that Alternative V (gas-turbines 4 x 25
MW + Steam 2 x 50 MW) would be the best among the four thermal alternatives.
Alternative Demand Forecasts
17.       The effect of market variations on the economics of the Sigalda
development was studied.  The equalizing discount rates between Sigalda and
the best thermal alternative (Alternative V) for the alternative demand fore-
casts (Annex 11) were found to be as follows (see Tables 11-14 for cost and
benefit streams):
Alternative I        vs        Alternative V
Main Forecast                       13.2%
hligh Forecast                      15.9%
Low Forecast                        11.7%
18.       The above results indicate that the economics of the Sigalda devel-
opment would be more favorable under the high forecast and that under the low
forecast the discount rate would be lowered, but would still be acceptable.
Sensitivity Tests
19.       Sensitivity tests for changes in capital costs and fuel cost in
comparing Alternatives I and V under alternative demand forecasts have also
been made. The range of values for the capital costs of Sigalda and thermal
stations have been taken to be plus 10% and minus 10%. For the fuel cost,
a lower value of 10% below the present price level has been assumed but a
higher value of 20% above in view of the upward trend of oil prices.
20.       The results of the tests are shown in Table 1.  As can be noted
the equalizing discount rate varies within the range 9.4% to 23.7%. Even
if the less favorable assumptions are combined, an unlikely contingency,
the rate remains above 9%, thus confirming the Sigalda development as the
least-cost solution.

ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN ON SIGALDA PROJECT
1.        The economic rate of return on the Project is the discount rate
which equalizes the present values of the time-streams of the costs and bene-
fits attributable to the project over its life. For this purpose a period of
50 years was adopted. The costs are the capital plus operating and mainte-
nance costs of the Sigalda station together with the associated transmission
facilities. The benefits comprise the following items:
(a) revenues from sales to the ordinary market, including sales
tax;
(b) revenues from sales to ISAL;
(c) revenues from sales to the fertilizer plant;
(d) net benefits from sales of electricity for additional domes-
tic space heating;
(e)  taxes payable by ISAL to the Iceland Government;
(f) revenue accruing to Iceland from the shipment of raw mate-
rials and finished aluminum on behalf of ISAL;
(g) higher wages earned by the extra workers employed by ISAL
compared with what they could earn in alternative employment;
(h) savings in power system operating costs when Sigalda is
in operation, through alleviation of the icing problem at
Burfell hydro station and consequent reduction in the need
to operate standby thermal plant.
The detailed figures are shown in Table 1ion page 6 of this Annex and their
derivation is described below.
Ordinary Market Sales
2.        On the main load projection (Annex 10), output from the Sigalda
Project will be needed to meet the incremental growth of sales to the ordinary
market (domestic, existing space heating, commercial, small industry, NATO base
and other), the annual requirement rising from 8 GWh in 1976 to 359 GWh in
1983, by which time Sigalda will be fully loaded up. The attributable rev-
enues from these sales, as derived from the financial forecasts in Annex 17,
plus the sales tax of 13% payable by the consumers, were taken as the measure
of the benefits.



ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 7
Sales to ISAL
3.        ISAL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Swiss Aluminium Company Ltd.,
at present has two potlines at its aluminum smelter, requiring respectively
80 and 60 MW of power. It is planned to extend the smaller potline from 60
to 80 MW by 1977, requiring an extra 160 GVh of energy, of which half could
be firm, half secondary, provided suitable terms can be negotiated. On the
main load projection used here the present NPC system could not supply any
additional firm energy, so that the extra 80 GWh would have to be supplied
from the Sigalda output. The prices for the additional quantities have still
to be negotiated. For its existing supplies (all firm energy) ISAL pays 3
mils/kWh, which was the competitive level when the present contract was
negotiated in 1966. In view of the subsequent rise in costs the current
figure for firm energy would be higher. NPC hopes to obtain 6 mils/kWh plus
2 mil/kWh for the 80 GWh of secondary energy, believing that the resulting
average price of 4 mils/kWh would still be attractive to ISAL in view of the
relatively minor additional costs the company will incur in extending the
existing potline to produce the extra output of aluminum (estimated at about
10,000 tons). This seems a reasonable expectation and these values have
therefore been adopted here.
Sales to Fertilizer Plaant
4.        On present plans, the energy requirements of the state-owned fer-
tilizer company are estimated to rise from their 1972 level of about 128 GWh
to 145 GWh in 1976 and 185 GTh in 1977, the maximum permitted under the cur-
rent contract. The present NPC system can meet these requirements up to 1976
but Sigalda will be needed to supply the additional 40 GWh in 1977.  Under the
terms of its contract, the fertilizer company pays the same price as ISAL.
This is 3 mils/kWh at present but is due to fall to 2.5 mils in 1975 concur-
rently with a rise in ISAL's tax liability from US$12.50 to US$20 per ton of
aluminum (the increase being equivalent to 0.5 mils/kWh). Continuation of
the 3 mils price has been assumed in the expectation that the Government will
be agreeable to foregoing the tax increase in order that the price payable
by ISAL should remain at its present level.
Domestic Space Heating
5.        The use of electricity for domestic space heating in Iceland is
relatively limited at present, although the downward trend of sales for this
purpose seems to have been reversed in recent years (see Annex 8). Most
households rely on natural hot water (from geothermal heat sources) or on
oil-fired central heating. As explained in Annex 10, NPC intends to start
active promotion of domestic electric space heating to take advantage of
the increased capability of the system when Sigalda comes into operation.
On the main load projection the space heating market is expected to grow
by 35 GWh p.a. from 1976 to a maximum of 280 GWh in 1983, of which Sigalda
will be required to supply 35 GWh in 1977, rising to 230 GWh in 1983, when
Sigalda is fullv loaded up.



ANNEX 13
Page 3 of 7
6.        NPC believes that a price appreciably below the present average
ordinary market rate of IKr 1.05/kWh (excluding sales tax) will be necessary
if the space heating market is to develop as planned. Their studies suggest
that a promotional price of IKr 0.80/kWh would be required. However for the
present purpose this price is not an appropriate measure of the net benefits
of the electricity supplied from Sigalda for space heating. In order to es-
timate these it is necessary to take account of associated costs as well as
benefits. On the benefits side, the main item is the benefit of a kWh for
space heating to the consumer. It could be argued that this is at least
equal to what he would have to pay for oil to supply an equivalent amount
of heat (the benefit is probably greater, because of the superior cleanliness
and convenience of electricity, but these advantages cannot be quantified).
The cost to the consumer of light distillate oil (as used for central heat-
ing), based on the current c.i.f. price, is the equivalent of IKr 0.96/kWh.
However, the proposed promotional price of IKr 0.80/kWh is conservatively
assumed here as the measure of the benefit to the consumer. The only other
quantified item 1/ on the benefits side is the saving to the economy in tne
cost of electric heating equipment for installation in new houses compared
with the cost of oil heating equipment to provide the same service; this
saving is estimated at IKr 67,000 per house at current prices. Offsetting
these benefits are the economic costs of converting existing oil-heated
houses to electric heating, estimated at IKr 47,000 per house, together with
the capital and operating costs of the distribution extensions and reinforce-
ment necessary to supply the new space-heating customers.  The resulting net
benefits are shown in Table 1 of this annex, they are negative in the early
years because costs of conversion and distribution extensions exceed the
savings on new installations and oil consumption.
ISAL Taxes
7.        Under its present agreement, ISAL pays a single consolidated tax
per ton of aluminum shipped in lieu of all taxes payable under Icelandic law.
This is currently US$12.50 but is due to rise in stages to US$35 in 1987.
The rate for the extra aluminum output (10,000 tons p.a.) using Sigalda power
remains to be negotiated but is conservatively assumed to be US$12.50. Tne
resulting tax yield of IKr 11 million 2/ is credited as a benefit to the
Project in view of the key importance of power in producing the extra
aluminum (possible minor offsetting costs in the form of free Government
services may be ignored in view of the conservative basis of the benefit
calculation).
1/   Another important benefit is the reduction in air pollution resulting
from the substitution of hydroelectricity for oil as the heat source,
but this cannot be quantified on the information available.
2/   At the current rate of US$1 - IKr 87.50, regarded as adequately reflect-
ing the scarcity value of foreign exchange.



ANNEX 13

Extra Freight Revenue
8.        Under the terms of its present agreement, ISAL is required to ship
all imported raw materials and equipment for its operations, except alumina,
and all exported aluminum by Icelandic vessels. It is assumed that a similar
arrangement will apply in respect of the aluminum to be produced using Sigalda
power. The quantity involved is some 10,000 tons. Each ton of finished alu-
minum requires (in addition to alumina) approximately 500 kg of carbon anodes
and 50 kg of cryolite, both of which materials have to be imported. For
10,000 tons of aluminum, therefore, the import requirements (excluding alu-
mina) amount to some 5,500 tons of material. In discussion the Icelandic
shipping line concerned indicated that it could handle these extra tonnages
of aluminum and processing materials without the need for any additional
carrying capacity. The only costs incurred would be the handling charges
and incremental running costs, which would be only a negligible proportion
of the freight charges, virtually the whole of which would represent a net
benefit.
9.        Current applicable freight rates are US$5.00/ton for imports and
US$5.50-7.00/ton (according to quantity and destination) for aluminum exports
to Europe, which takes the bulk of ISAL's output. These rates are scheduled
to increase by 504/ton by 1975 i.e. to US$5.50/ton for imports and US$6.00-
7.50/ton for aluminum exports. Further increases in rates beyond 1975 are
to be expected but it was conservatively assumed that the 1975 rates would
apply for the purpose of calculating freight revenues. It was also assumed
that the net benefit would be 80% of these rates and that the market pattern
of aluminum shipments would be broadly as at present. As shown in Table 1,
this results in a benefit of IKr 8 million p.a.
ISAL Wage Benefits
10.       ISAL expects to employ 25 extra unskilled workers when it expands
capacity. It pays well above the opportunity cost of labor, as measured
(given Iceland's full employment) by the market wage. The differential hith-
erto compared with the national average unskilled wage may have been around
30%, though in comparison with the lowest unskilled wage in the Reykjavik
area it is over 100%. This may be attributed to various demand/supply factors.
On the demand side is the fact that ISAL does not belong to the Icelandic em-
ployers' federation, making its more vulnerable to union pressure. Moreover,
aluminum smelting is a continuous process industry where stoppages can be very
costly, not only in lost output but in damage to expensive equipment; this
again makes the company peculiarly vulnerable to union demands. The main
factor on the supply side is probably the relative unattractiveness to the
ordinary Icelandic worker of employment in an aluminum smelter, a type of
heavy industrial work to which he is unaccustomed. The wages paid, there-
fore, presumably include an element of compensation for this extra disutil-
ity compared with alternative employment, which represents a cost partially
offsetting the benefit of the higher wage. To the extent that the higher
wages paid by ISAL contribute to the inflation in Iceland, this must also
be accounted a cost. It seems likely also that the wage differential itself
will tend to narrow over time.



ANNEX 13
Page 5 of 7
11.       The net benefits resulting from the interplay of these various fac-
tors are difficult to evaluate with any precision but they are not a signif-
icant element in the analysis and they have been conservatively assumed here
to be IKr 100,000 per worker (out of a present average annual wage paid by
ISAL of IKr 565,000) for the first 10 years of Sigalda's operation.
Reduction of Burfell Icing
12.       One of the problems with the Burfell hydroelectric station is that
its operation is liable to interruption in winter as a result of accumulations
of sludge ice. When this happens the lost output has to be made good from
standby thermal plants, resulting in extra operating costs for fuel, over-
time and emergency operation. The estimated costs of such interruptions in
the winter of 1970-71 amounted to about IKr 5 million. Studies by NPC sug-
gest that, in the absence of remedial action, in the future, allowing for
the normal range of climatic conditions in the area, the cost is likely to
vary between IKr 10 million and IKr 26 million p.a.
13.       One of the purposes of the Sigalda development is to solve this
problem by creating a reservoir from which water can be discharged for
flushing purposes if ice accumulations threaten to interrupt the operation
of the Burfell station. The resulting benefit in system cost savings has
been conservatively assumed here to be the lower figure of IKr 10 million
p.a. mentioned above.
Economic Rate of Return
14.       As shown in Table 1, comparison of the costs and benefits described
above results in a rate of return on the Project of 10.7%. This understates
the true economic return, since it takes no account of unquantified benefits,
such as the reduction in air pollution through substitution of hydroelectric
space heating for oil-fired heating. The calculated rate is acceptable, since
the opportunity cost of capital in Iceland has been roughly estimated (accord-
ing to a Central Bank study) at around 8%. This relatively low rate presumably
reflects the narrow industrial base and the linited investment opportunities
hitherto.
Sensitivity Tests
15.       The sensitivty of the calculated rate of return was tested for
variations in the values of the main assumptions (load growth, capital costs,
ordinary market tariff and the price of oil for space heating) covering the
likely range of possibilities. The results are summarized in Table 2 of
this Annex. It will be seen that the rate of return is relatively insensi-
tive to variations in individual assumptions, moving only one percentage
point, or less, up or down, and that if the less favorable assumptions are
combined the rate is 8.7%, compared with 13.8% in the opposite case of com-
bining the more favorable assumptions.

ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING FINANCIAL FORECASTS
A.   INCOME STATEMENT
1.   Revenues
Sales to the ordinary market are shown in Annex 10. The forecasts
reflect the 20% tariff increase effective from March 1, 1973, and the 2% re-
duction ordered by Government from May 7, 1973, and assume further tariff in-
creases of 20% effective December 1, 1973 and 10% each effective June 1, 1974,
May 1, 1975 and January 1, 1976. Sales for new space heating are assumed to
start during 1976 at 35 GWh, increasing by 35 GWh annually until 1981 and
priced at the promotional tariff of 80 au/kWh.
Annual sales to the fertilizer plant are estimated at 145 GWh from
1973 through 1976 and at 185 GWh thereafter.
Annual sales to the smelter for its present smelting capacity are
estimated at 1180 GWh in 1973 and 1190 GWhi from 1974 through 1980.  The ex-
tension of the second potline is assumed to operate from 1977, giving addi-
tional annual sales of 160 GWh from 1977 onwards.
The price assumed for the fertilizer plant is the current contract
price of 3 US mils per kWh until September 30, 1975, which is assumed to con-
tinue at the same level thereafter on the basis of agreement to be reached
among ISAL, NPC, the fertilizer plant and Government. The price for supplies
for the smelter potline extension is assumed to be 4 US mils per kWh.
2.        Operating Expenses
Expenses of operation, maintenance and administration of the cur-
rently operating systems are based on estimates made by NPC and assumed to
increase at 8% p.a. from 1974 on account of wage increases and other cost
increases due to inflation. For Sigalda, operation and maintenance expenses
have been estimated at IKr 0.2 million per MW.
The price equalization tax is based on a formula, with an annual
upper limit of IKr 47 million. The forecasts assume Government's repeal of
the tax from January 1, 1974.
Depreciation for the years 1973 onwards has been calculated on the
revalued assets in operation at January 1, 1973 and upon subsequent additions
at cost at the following rates:

C.   BALANCE SHEET
1.   Fixed Assets in Operation
On a tentative revaluation made by the mission using the building
cost index for local expenditure and an adjustment for exchange losses as
at end of 1972, the fixed asset values as at January 1, 1973 have been in-
creased as follows:
IKr million
Increase in gross fixed assets              1,470
Less:  Increase in depreciation               258
Increase in net fixed assets in
operation                                 1,312
2.   Revaluation Surplus
