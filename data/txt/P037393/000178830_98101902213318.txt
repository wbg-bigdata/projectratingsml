INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVEWPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO LANDSVIRKJUN (NATIONAL POWER COMPANY)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND
FOR THE SIGALDA HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Landsvirkjun (National Power Company - NPC), with the guarantee
of the Republic of Iceland, for the equivalent of US$10 million to help
finance the foreign exchange cost of a hydroelectric project. The loan
would have a term of 25 years, including 4 years of grace, with interest
at 7-I/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report on Iceland entitled "Current Economic Posi-
tion and Prospects of Iceland" (R 69-216) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on November 12, 1969. Since then, two missions visited Iceland
briefly in August 1971 and April 1973 to bring up -to-date the Bank's in-
formation on the economy. Their findings have been reflected in the
President's Report and Recommendation to the Executive Directors for the
Fishing Harbors Rehabilitation Project (R 73-235) which was approved on
October 16, 1973. This information is reproduced with some modification
in Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
3.        The Bank has made nine loans, totalling US$37 million to, or
guaranteed by, the Republic of Iceland. Work under all projects has been
accomplished satisfactorily, except for the recent loan for the '
Fishing Harbors Rehabilitation project. Disbursements under the 1970
Highways loan (707-IC) were completed early in November 1973. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans as of October 31, 1973.
There have been no IFC investments in Iceland so far and none is under
consideration.
4.        The proposed loan would be the third in the power sector; the
first loan was made in 1951 to the Government for the construction of
hydroelectric facilities and the second was in 1966 to NPC for the Burfell
hydroelectric project,.which made possible the establishment of the aluminum
industry in Iceland. Both projects have been completed successfully and
are operating satisfactorily. Iceland, with some assistance from the Bank,



has Deen able to make increasing use of international capital markets to
meet its need for long-term external capital. It is expected that the
country will in the future be able to obtain all the external capital it
requires for development projects in world markets. Hence, no further
Bank lending after FY74 is presently envisaged.
PART III - POWER SECTOR
5e        The power sector has a key role to play in the Icelandic economy,
since Government efforts to diversify economic activity and exports depend
mainly on the development of power-intensive industries utilizing the coun-
try's abundant hydropower resources.
6.        The two main energy resources in Iceland are hydroelectric and
geothermal energy. Fossil fuels are non-existent, except for small peat
and lignite deposits. Oil requirements are met by imports, mainly from
USSR, in barter exchange for fish products and textiles.
7.        The economically-exploitable hydroelectric power potential is
estimated at 18,000 GWh per annum, equivalent to about 2,000 MW of continu-
ous capacity under normal hydrological conditions. Total installed hydro-
power capacity is 364 MW, of which NPC's share is about 90 percent (329 MW).
About 50 percent of the houses, including 95 percent in Reykjavik, are
supplied with hot water produced by geothermal heat. Geothermal energy has
also been applied to industry and agriculture on a small scale. A small
pilot power plant in Northern Iceland uses geothermal steam but the feasi-
bility of larger plants remains to be confirmed. Research is being done on
other possible applications of geothermal energy, estimated reserves of
wl.ich are roughly equal to the hydropower reserves on a heat equivalent
basis.
8.        The relatively limited Icelandic power market is shared by
26 separate electric utilities of which one (the State Electric Power
Works - RARIK) is state-owned, two (NPC and Laxarvirkjun) are under joint
state-municipality ownership and 23 are owned by municipalities. These
are regulated under the Energy Law, the provisions of which are adminis-
tered by the Minister responsible for power (presently the Minister of
Industry), with the assistance of the National Energy Authority. Some
integration would seem economically desirable in the unduly fragmented
power sector. The Government has therefore confirmed its intention to
continue and expand studies of the organization of the sector with the
assistance of consultants. NPC, established in 1965 and jointly owned by
the Icelandic Government and the city of Reykjavik, is by far the largest
power producer, accounting for about o5 percent of the total power
generation. Laxarvirkjun, in the north, is next with about 7 percent,
followed by RARIK, which mainly promotes electrification in rural areas,
with 5 percent. Twenty-three municipal undertakings account for the
remaining 3 percent.



-3-
9.        Total electricity production by all public utilities rose from
640 GWh in 1963 to 1,770 GWh in 1972, equivalent to an average 12 percent
per annum growth rate; and installed capacity increased from 150 MW to
450 MW during the same period. Capital investment in power facilities
during the years 1965 through 1972 amounted to some US$110 million. Of
this amount, US$45 million was invested in the Burfell power station, for
which the Bank lent US$18 million in 1966 and which made it possible for
NPC to supply a large amount of power direct to the Icelandic Aluminiur
Company (ISAL). ISAL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alusuisse (Switzerland),
was established in 1969 as a result of the Government's efforts to attract
foreign power-intensive industries to Iceland, and consumed 771 GWh in 1972,
about 55 percent of NPC's total sales. A market survey has indicated an
additional electric space-heating market in NPC's service area, rising
from 35 GWh to 280 GWh over a period of eight years commencing in 1976.
Additional requirements of 160 GWh for the aluminum smelter, commencing
in 1977, and 40 GWh for the state-owned fertilizer plant, are also
expected. As a result of these new loads and the increasing requirements
of other consumers, maximum demand on the NPC system is expected to reach
313 MW in 1976, when extra generating capacity will be required. The
proposed project is designed to meet this need. There are also good pros-
pects for a ferro-silicon plant coming to Iceland in 1977, with estimated
power requirements of about 400 GWh (half firm, half interruptible).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
10.       With the full utilization of the capacity of the Burfell hydro-
electric power station clearly in sight, NPC, with assistance from its
consultants, prepared the Sigalda Hydroelectric project and applied for
a Bank loan in 1972. A Bank pre-appraisal mission in October 1972 found
that the project would be the logical next step in the development of
the country's hydropower potential. The project was appraised in
January/February 1973, and negotiations were held in Washington in
October. The Icelandic delegation comprised representatives of NPC, the
Government and the City of Reykjavik, and was led by Dr. Johannes Nordal,
Governor of the Central Bank.
Project Description
11.       The proposed project, which is summarized in Annex III and
described in detail in the Appraisal Report entitled "Sigalda Hydroelectric
Project" (No. 239a-IC), which is being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors, would form part of NPC's interconnected system serving
southwest Iceland, where over 70 percent of the population resides and
which accounts for nearly 90 percent of the country's power demand. The
project would comprise the construction of a hydropower station with two
50-MW units on the Tungnaa, about 100 miles from Reykjavik, a 35-km double-
circuit 220-kv transmission line from Sigalda to Burfell with associated
tie-in equipment and consulting services.



NPC has about 70 permanent employees.   It has six power stations
wit.h a tcotal capacity of 333 MW, including the 240-MW Burfell station.  It
comi-ipleted two single-circuit 220-kv transmission lines in 1969 and early
1973 respectively, and a storage pr ject at Lake Thorisvatn in 1972 with a
storage capacity of 1,000 million in-, which serves to regulate the natural
river flow for the benefit of Burfell and will serve 'Later for Sigalda and
other power plants.
13.       Although N'C is empowered to set wholesale tariffs after consul-
tation with the Economic Institute, a government agency, to obtain a
reasonable return on investment and earn an adequate surplus for supporting
expansLon, government approval is required for tariff revision under the
present anti-inflationary system of price controls.
14.       NPC sells bulk power to the municipal enterprises of Reykjavik
and Hafnarfjordur and the state-owned RARIK. These three customers of
NPC constitute the so-called ordinary market for power. ISAL and the
state-owned fertilizer plant are the only two power-intensive enterprises
to which NPC supplies power directly. In 1972 NPC sold 1,408 GWho In
1973 sales are expected to increase to 1,870 GWdh of which 29 percent would
be to the ordinary market and 71 percent direct to industry.
Project Costs and Financing
'15.      The total cost of the project, excluding interest during construc-
tion, is estimated to be $56.4 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
cost of $35.5 million equivalent.
16.       Of the proposed Bank loan of US$10 million, US$9.2 million would
be used to cover 47 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the civil works
and US$0.8 million to cover 25 percent of the foreign exchange cost of
consultants' services.  These items together total $22.7 million of the
total foreign exchange costs of $35.5 million.   Thus the proposed loan
would finance 28 percent of the total foreign exchange costs.
17.       Out of NPC's total 1973-77 construction expenditure of which the
Project, excluding interest during construction, forms 81 percent and
interest during constraction 13 percent, self-generation of cash will
finance 13 percent, tne Bank loan 14 percent, suppliers' credits 13 per-
cent, equity and loan contr'butions from Government and the city of
Reykjavik 17 percent, a 20-yeear Belgian loan 8 percent and other borrowings
the balance of 35 percent. These other borrowings would initially be in
the form of interim financing from foreign banks of up to US$13 million
between 1973 and 1975, wrnic- would be repaid from the proceeds of bond
issues of US$25 million guaranteed by the Government and planned to be
floated in 1976 and 19'17.  Thea interim financing would be drawn down from
a 10-year line of credit without commitment charges, the arrangements for
which are well in hard. NPC and its investment bankers are confident
that they will be able Tr, flOrt oonds since Iceland's international
credit standing is good. SLc*E NPC is expected to have a cash shorgage
throughout the constractioY. m-rod, an assurance has been obtained from



- 5 -
the Government that the funds for the project's timely completion would be
made available if NPC were unable to raise them.
18.       NPC's net cash generation amounts only to 13 percent of capital
expenditure which, although low by normal standards, is acceptable con-
sidering NFC's high debt service obligations and because Sigalda represents
a major addition to NPC's facilities. In view of this, it was agreed
during negotiations that certain measures would be taken to ensure  hatu
adequate funds were made available for the project consistent with NX."
maintaining a tight but viable financial position. Most of these concern
tariffs. At present about 71 percent of NPC's sales are to ISAL and the
fertilizer plant on fixed tariffs leaving only a comparatively small mar-
ket (29 percent of total sales) susceptible to tariff increases designed
to take account of rising costs and to help finance new developments.
NPC has introdiced several tariff increases in the past, the most recent
being on December 1, 1973. The financing plan assumes perioce tariff
increases throughout the project implementation period. The Governmtent
and NPC have confirmed that measures would be takern periodically to revise
the general tariff structure to take account, inter alia, of rising costs.
Under the existing agreement, the tariff for ISAL is fixed at 3.0 US rmils
per kM  until September 30, 1975 and at 2.5 US mLils per kWh therseafter.
After September 30, 1975 the Government might raise its tax on ISAL's
production by the equivalent of 0.5 US mils per kWh, so ISAL's total pay-
ments would remain at the same level. During negotiations, NPC confirmed
its intention to seek, in collaboration with the Government and Alusuisse,
a revision of the agreement with ISAL. The financial plan assumes that
NPC would continue to receive 3.0 US mils per kWh. The fertilizer plant
pays the same tariff as that for ISAL under the existing agreement. NPC
also confirmed that, in negotiating supply contracts with new major
consumers, flexible tariffs would be introduced to take account of rising
costs and currency revaluations.
19.       NPC currently pays a price equalization tax amounting to
IXr 47 million per anunm to a fund established mainly to finance rural
electrification, which is scheduled to be virtually completed during
1974. NPC intends to seek the exemption from the tax from January 1, 1974,
and this has been assuimed in the financial plan.
20.       To farther maximize the cash available from NPC's earnings
during the construction period, an assurance was obtained from NPC during
negotiations that, during this Deriod, no dividends would be paid on equity
contributions made by the owners of NPC nor interest on subordinated loans
made by the Government without the Bank's consent. Cash shortfalls during
this period would be met by short-term overdraft financing from local banks.
21'.      Despite these measures NPCI s liquidity would remain rather dif-
ficult throughout the construction period with the current ratio not rising
above 0.4. Internal cash generation would cover debt service requirements
for 1974 and 1975, but only three-fourths of the requirements in 1973,
1976 and 1977. Farthernore, under the Burfell agreement, a limit of
$800,000 was set on NPC's borrowings, without the Bank's prior agreement,



-6
.:rnless net cash earnings before depreciation and interest exceeded 15 times
ebt service in any year.  NPC has never attained this ratio but the Bank
has hitherto felt able to approve requests for raising additional loans.
Because of the need to obtain commercial loans promptly for the implementa-
tion of the project, NPC would be permitted, subject to Bank approval of
terns, to borrow up to US$49.2 million outstanding at any one time to
complete the project and to raise US$1.0 million of bridging finance
through 1977.
22,       With respect to the rate of return, under the Burfell agreement
NPC is required to earn a rate of 8 percent on its net fixed asse-ts in
operation from 1973 onwards. N-P has agreed, as a condition of effectiveness,
to revalue its fixed assets.  Due partly to the revaluation of assets in 1973,
it is unlikely that NPC will achieve this level during 1973. During negotia-
tions it was agreed that the covenant in Loan No. 466-IC would therefore be
replaced by a similar rate covenant with the following provisionss
(a)  the return should be at least 8 percent in 197h, 9.5 percent in
1975, and 8.5 percent in 1976 (this would make up the 1973
shortfall and give an average 8 percent during these years).
Thereafter the return should be at least 8 percent except in
1977;
(b) for 1977, the year in which the rate base would reflect the
addition of the Sigalda assets without a full year's commen-
surate revenues, the return would be only 7 percent;
(c) in the event of a shortfall in any year beginning 1974, NPC
would make up the shortfall in the following year; and
(d) the return would be computed on the average of the net fixed
assets in service at the beginning and end of each year
instead of assets at the beginning of each year as at present.
Project Implementation
23.       With its past experience in developing and constructing power
projects, including the construction of the Burfell project, NPC would be
responsible for implementing the proposed project. As in the case of
the Burfell project, it has engaged competent engineering consultants to
assist both with the detailed engineering as well as the supervision over
the construction of the proposed project. In order to achieve continuity,
the consulting firm of Electro-Watt Engineering Services Ltd. of Switzer-
land in association with Virkir H.F.,.an Icelandic consulting firm, which
helped NPC to prepare the feasibility study for the proposed project and
later to prepare the tender documents for civil works and electrical and
mechanical equipment, has been appointed for this purpose by NPC.
Procurement
24.       International tenders for the civil works were invited in
September 1972, in accordance with the Bank guidelines, and the contract
was awarded to Energoprojekt (Yugoslavia) in July 1973, after review by



-7-
the Bank. Construction work began in the fall of 1973. The contract for
the electrical and mechanical equipment, which would not be financed by
the Bank loan, was awarded to a consortium of Brown Boveri (Germany) and
Energomachexport (USSR) in August 1973, following international competi-
tive tenders with long-term financing. There will be no retroAetive
financing. Contract documents are in preparation for the transmission
system, for which selected international bids will be invited.
Disbursements
25.       Disbursements would be made for 50 percent of the foreign currency
cost of civil works and for 25 percent of the foreign currency cost of con-
sultants' services.
Economic Justification
26.       Among the possible hydro-development sites, Sigalda has been found
to be the logical next choice. The project represents the least cost solu-
tion for meeting the country's power needs. Five alternative development
strategies have been studied to confirm this, i.e. Sigalda, gas turbines,
steam and two combinations of gas turbines and steam. The proposed project
has been found to be the most economical at discount rates of up to 13 per-
cent. Sensitivity tests for variations in market growth, capital and fuel
costs show that even if all the less favorable assumptions were combined
the equalizing discount rate remains above 9 percent, compared with the
estimated opportunity cost of capital in Iceland of about 8 percent.  If
all the more favorable assumptions are combined, the discount rate rises
to nearly 24 percent.
27.       The economic rate of return on the project is estimated at a
minimum of 10.7 percent. The main quantifiable benefits would consist of
incremental revenues attributable to the project from power sales to the
ordinary market (including.sales tax) and power-intensive industries, plus
net benefits from extra power sales for space heating; extra taxes payable
by ISAL, and savings in system operating costs through reduced icing at the
Burfell station. The rate was found to be relatively insensitive to indi-
vidual variations in the main variables (load growth, capital costs, tariffs and
oil prices). Even if all the less favorable assumptions were combined, the
rate remains above 8 percent, and it is nearly 14 percent if the more
favorable assumptions are combined.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
28.        The draft Loan Agreement between Landsvirkjun and the Bank, the
draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Iceland and the Bank,
draft supplemental letters regarding Rate of Return, Studies of the Organi-
zation of the Pbwer Sector and the Tariff Structure, Provisions of Funds
(Sigalda) and Provisions of Fund, {-Sigalda and Burfell) and -the--Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed



-8-
loan are being distributed to the Executive I)irectors separately. The
draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for power pro-
jects.
29.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
30.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

BALKGX-T1ND ECONOMIC DEVEDDPYT
(Updated Reproduction of Part I, President's Report
and Recommendation for the Fishing Harbors
Rehabilitation Project - R 72-235 dated October 4, 1973)
1.        The structure of the economy of Iceland is determined by the
country's proximity to rich fishing breeding grounds and a relative
absence of natural resources other than potential hydroelectric and geo-
the_nnal power. Fishing and fish processing have traditionally been pre-
dorinant In the econormy, accounting for '4 percent of total production and
employment, and 80 percent of merchandise exports.   Other industries, such
as construction and services, depend on fishing as a primary industry and
as the principal source of foreign exchange earnings.    Only 20 percent of
the land is suitable for agriculture, of which about one-quarter is under
cultivation and the remainder is used mainly for livestock.    Iceland is
self-sufficient in meat and dairy products, but imports cereals and cereal
products. The agricultural sector employs about 11 percent of the labor
force, and its contribution to GNP has fallen from 9 percent in 1960 to
5 percent in 1972.  There are no known mineral deposits of coimercial
significance, except for diatomite which is used commercially as a filtration
agent.
2.        Iceland has been able to attain a relatively high rate of growth
of real GNP during the last two decades, when it averaged about 5 percent
per year.   The population increased during the period at an average annual
rate of about 1.6 percent. Growth has, however, been marked by instability
resulting from the fluctuations in fish catches and fish prices. In three
of the last 20 years, real GNP has actually declined from the level in the
preceding year.
3.        Iceland has maintained a high rate of investment, with gross fixed
asset formation averaging about 29 percent of GNP during the last decade.
The domestic savings ratio averaged about 25-26 percent during the same
period, with foreign resources in the form of external borrowing and direct
investment filling the gap. The share of construction in total fixed invest-
ment averaged over 65 percent during 1960-70: this high proportion reflects
the harsh climate and geography, and the use of housing as a hedge against
the high rate of inflation.
4.        Since Iceland has an open economy (exports of goods and services
are nearly 50 percent of GNP), and because there are very large fluctuations
in the country's export earnings, there are difficult problems of demand
management and economic stabilization.    Economic policy has emphasized the
maintenance of a high level of employment, and of parity in the growth of
incomes between the fisheries and other sectors. The control of inflation
has been given less emphasis, although inflationary trends have led to price
controls and monetary restrictions. The fiscal instrument cannot be used
effectively for stabilization, because of the relatively large share of local
governments in revenue and expenditure and the high proportion of government
tax receipts earmarked for specific objectives. Moreover, the bulk of tax
revenue is derived from indirect taxes and, since changes in these effect
prices and (through index linking) wages, the effect of tax measures are
diluted. In 1970 a Price Stabilization Fund was established for the fish-

ing industry, to be replenished when fish prices are higher than expected
and to be drawn down when prices are lower.
5.        Since 1960 Iceland has embarked on a policy of increasing trade
liberalization, a trend that was stimulated by Iceland's joining EFTA in
1970.   In 1971 about 93 percent of total imports were liberalized.  Importis
of all industrial commodities, except petroleum products, are to be liberal-
ized by 1975. Petroleum products are imported from the USSR, to which
Iceland exports certain fish products which would have some difficulty in.
marketing elsewhere.   There has been some reduction in protective tariffs
following the agreement with EFTA and the trend will accelerate in the nextu
few years as a result of the trade agreement with Earopean Economic Community
(EEC).
Recent Developments
6.        The instability of the fishing sector has dominated recent develop-
ments.  Following a catastrophic decline in the fish catch, real incomes
declined in 1967-68 by nearly 20 percent.   The economic upswing following
an increase in the value of the fish catch in 1969, was transforned in 1971
72 into a domestic boom, and the balance of payments situation deteriorated
as a result of a rapid increase in imports. Real GNP increased by about 6
percent in 1970, over 9 percent in 1971 and 6 percent in 1972.   There was
particularly rapid increase in private consumption and fixed investrment
during this period. The rate of unemployment declined from about 2.5 per-
cent of the labor force in 1969 to 0.5 percent in 1972.
7.        The value of merchandise exports increased by over 20 percent per
annum during 1969-72, mainly because of the increase in fish prices. With
the acceleration of economic activity, there was a rapid expansion of
merchandise imports (averaging 23 percent per year) during 1969-72, to some
extent related to large expenditures on ships and aircraft in 1971 and imports
for the aluminum factory and power projects.   There was a large current
account deficit of about $44 million in 1971 falling to $20 million in 19720
However, inflows of direct investment and loan capital exceeded the current
deficit and foreign exchange reserves increased.   During the general realign-
ment of currencies in December 1971 the Krona was devalued by nearly 8 per-
cent, and in December 1972, it was again devalued by about 11 percent. Follow-
ing the currency adjustments during February 1972, Iceland maintained the
parity of the Krona with the dollar.   These adjustments kept the external
purchasing power of the Krona in line with domestic inflation.    Since March
1973 the realignment of major currencies through floating exchange rates
together with a favorable price trend for Iceland's export products, has
necessitated a revaluation of the Krona to avoid further impetus to the
serious inflationary trend. The par value of the Krona was increased by 6
percent in April 1973, and the subsequent abolition of the margin between
official buying and selling rates and the par value has resulted in a further
K:rona revaluation of around 4 percent.
8.        The cost of living index rose at an average rate of 10 percent
per year during 1969-72, Wages are linked to increases in the cost of



A.61QTEX I

living.   The Government tried to influence the wage settlements of December
1971 through the elimination of sales tax on necessities, increased consumer
subsidies and the reductioni of the working week.  However, hourly nominal
wage rates increased by nearly 19 percent in 1971 and 27 percent in 1972.
In truly 1972 thE Government imposed a price freeze and increased subsidies
to reduce the rate of price increases.
9.        Manufacturing industry (exclucEng flsh processing) contributes
about 15 percent of G'NPo  TChe bulk oF it consists of small scale industries
producing mainly for the local market, although there has recently been sor;.e
increase in exports.   These srall industries lack modern management skills,
particularly in finance and marketing.   Major new export industries are
diatomite and aluminum.   The production of the aluninum increased from 38,000
tons in 1970 to 41,500 tons in 1971 and about 45,500 tons in 1972.   Because
of the slack demand, exports of aluminum dropped from 33,500 tons in 1970
to 17,600 tons in 1971, but increased to 59,000 tons in 1972, although
export prices were then 13.5 percent lower. The net impact of the aluminum
industry on the balance of payments is small, because of the large import
content in production. During 1970-72 the net total value of aluminum exports
was about $27 million.
10.       The industrial trade agreement signed with EEC in July, 1972, which
applied to all industrial products and to most categories of Icelandic fish
products, provides that EEC tariffs will be abolished in five equal instal-
ments from April 1972 through July 1977, except for aluminum on which the
tariff will be abolished in 1980.   Iceland's protective tariffs on industrial
imports from the EEC countries will be eliminated by 1980.    EEC has reserved
the right not to apply the provisions of tariff reductions on fish products
until the resolution of Iceland's fishing dispute with the UK and Germany.
The first tariff reduction on industrial commodities under the agreement came
into effect from April 1973. There is little doubt that the gradual reduction
of protective tariffs on industrial imports will necessitate substantial
readjustment in those manufacturing industries in Iceland that have benefitted
from protection in the domestic market.  The restructuring of the manufacturing
sector would require modernization and reorganization.
Economic Consequences of the Volcanic Eruption
11.       On January 23, 1973 a volcano at Vestmannaeyjar erupted and caused
heavy damage on the island. Vestmannaeyjar was the country's most important
fishing port until the eruption, which led to the entire population of 5,200
and the fleet of about 80 fishing vessels being evacuated from the island.
Volcanic activity stopped at the end of June. It is estimated that the damage
thus far sustained will lead to a 2 percent loss in GNP in 1973, compared with
1972, and a 5 percent loss in export earnings. The replacement value of
property destroyed has reached about US$100 million, equivalent to 13 percent
of the forecast GNP for 1973. About 400 of 1,340 dwellings on the island
have been destroyed and four of the seven fish processing plants destroyed or
seriously damaged. The diversion of resources into reallocation and salvage
of property and the resources that will have to go into reconstruction will



ANNEX I
Page 7 of 7 pages
have a major impact on capital formaticn and therefore on future growth of
the small, full employment economy of Iceland. The eruption on Vestmannaey-
jar has thus hit the mainstream of economic life and will have far-reaching
consequences for the nation as a whole.   It is estimated that, barring fur-
ther volcanic eruption, about one-half to two-thirds of the population will
return to the island within two to five years.
External Debt
12.       Iceland's total long and medium term external debt was $196 million
at the end of 1972 of which US$22 million was owed to the Bank; and total
annual debt service was $35 million, of which US$2.4 million was to the
Bank. The debt service ratio increased from around 8 percent during 1963-66
to over 16 percent in 1969 as a result of the fall in fish catches and prices,
but fell to 12 percent in 1972 with the recovery of export earnings. Since
the prospects for fish product exports are favorable and given the industrious-
ness of the Icelandic people, backed by prudent monetary policies, Iceland
can be considered creditworthy for further Bank lending.
