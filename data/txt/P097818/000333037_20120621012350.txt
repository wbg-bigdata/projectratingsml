                                                                                       E1485 v2

              Environmental Management Plan Checklist and Format
                                  for Low-risk Topologies

For low-risk topologies, an alternative to the commonly used “full text? EMP format is to have a
checklist approach. The goal is to provide a more streamlined approach to preparing EMPs. This
checklist-type format (“EMP Checklist,? see Annex 3) has been developed to provide “pragmatic
good practice? and designed to be user friendly and compatible with safeguard requirements. A
blank sample is attached as Annex 3.
The checklist-type format attempts to cover typical mitigation approaches to common low-risk
topologies with temporary localized impacts. It is anticipated that this format provides the key
elements of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to meet World Bank Environmental As-
sessment requirements under OP 4.01 (see Annex 1).
The EMP (Annex 2) format has two sections:
• Part I: constitutes a descriptive part (“site passport?) that describes the project specifics in
  terms of physical location, the institutional and legislative aspects, the project description, in-
  clusive of the need for a capacity building program and description of the public consultation
  process. This section could be up to two pages long. Attachments for additional information
  can be supplemented if needed.
• Part II: includes the environmental and social screening in a simple Yes/No format followed
  by mitigation measures for any given activity and the monitoring plan for activities during
  project construction and implementation. It retains the same format required for standard
  World Bank EMPs.


Application of the EMP-Checklist
The practical application of the EMP-checklist would include the filling in of Part I to obtain and
document all relevant site characteristics and activities. In Part 2 the type of foreseen works, as
obtained from the design documents, would be checked and the resulting provisions listed below
highlighted (e.g. by hatching the field or copy pasting the relevant text passages into the special
provisions of the tender documents.
The whole filled in tabular EMP is additionally attached as integral part to the works contract
and, analogous to all technical and commercial terms, has to be signed by the contract parties.
For the monitoring of the Contractor’s safeguards due diligence the designated construction in-
spector works with Part C of the EMP Checklist, the monitoring plan. This should be developed
site specifically and in necessary detail, defining clear criteria and parameters which can be in-
cluded in the works contracts, which reflect the status of environmental practice on the construc-
tion site and which can be observed/measured/ quantified/verified by the inspector during the
construction works.
Part C would thus be filled in during the design process to fix key monitoring criteria which can
be checked during and after works for compliance assurance and ultimately the Contractor’s re-
muneration.

            ENERGY SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE GRANT PROJECT

                                           Rwanda]
                                              (Date)

PART I: Activity Description

1.     I NTRODUCTION

    The Sustainable Energy Development Project (SEDP) is focusing on improving the policy
and institutional framework for the Rwandan renewable energy market and funding for micro
hydro and solar projects was to come from other donors and commercial banks and private in-
vestors. Progress is being made on policy development in relation to Independent Power Produc-
ers (IPPs), feed-in tariffs and off-grid hydro developments, but so far the number of private sec-
tor led small energy projects, which have been able to complete financing and start construction,
has been limited. The proposed Energy Small and Medium Enterprise Project (The ESME
Project) will complement the Sustainable Energy Development Project within the broader
framework of the Government’s National Energy Access program supported through the SWAp.
It will help the Government of Rwanda in mainstreaming renewable energy development by
complementing the efforts made on grid extension through the IDA Electricity Access Scale up
and SWAp Development Project.

1. Project Objective: The Project Development Objective of the ESME Project is to increase
   private sector participation in the Renewable Energy Sector


2. Project Description: The total project cost are estimated at US$3.5 million and the ESME
   Project will have the following project components: (a) provision of grants to private devel-
   opers for micro-hydropower projects and associated grid network connection lines (US$2.4
   million; (b) provision of grants to local businesses to support the support the marketing and
   development of a dealer network for low cost modern off-grid lighting solutions in rural
   areas (US$0.6 million; (c) technical assistance and training for capacity development of local
   manufacturers and dealers of pico hydropower equipment. US$0.2 million and; (d) operating
   costs for project coordination, administration, consulting services, training and implementa-
   tion support (US$0.3 million).

    A pipeline of micro hydropower projects and associated distribution systems has already
been identified largely through the work of the GIZ PSP Hydropower project. As part of project
preparation GVEP International has undertaken a preliminary analysis of the readiness of the
project pipeline. In a few cases, site development has been initiated and most for other sites, de-
tailed feasibility studies and business plans are expected to be completed in the next few months.
The ESME Project funding will be used to provide grants for about five to seven projects cur-
rently being developed by private sector developers. Detailed eligibility criteria for grants from
the ESME Project have been formulated.

Environmental Footprint: It is not yet certain which sub projects will be financed under the
ESME projects. A preliminary review of the potential sub projects shows that these projects are
expected to have only a modest impact on the environment and population. It is anticipated that 5
to 7 projects will be financed of which the individual capacity will remain well below 1 MW.
No displacement of population is anticipated.


3. P OLICY, L EGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE F RAMEWORK
The overall responsibility for management of the bio-physical environment throughout Rwanda
lies with the Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA), which was legally estab-
lished in November 2003. EIAs and SEAs are obligatory for projects and programs according the
Organic Law on Environment (2005) for both private and public investments. REMA staff are
competent but overstretched. REMA’s EA office was transferred to the RDB, with the exception
of the Monitoring and Enforcement unit, which is still under REMA, and is currently under the
Investment Implementation Department. This means that there are two agencies with shared re-
sponsibility for the EIA process in Rwanda. REMA has retained responsibilities for monitoring
and enforcement while the Environmental Analysts at RDB are responsible for the EIA process
and issuing the license.


4. R ELEVANT W ORLD BANK P OLICIES

In the case of the sustainable development of micro-hydros the Project will provide a national
operational framework for investments made by small Independent Power Producers (IPPs), and
will also provide investment financing. Such investments will have limited environmental and
social implications. However, the small size of these sub-projects, and the fact that they are run-
of-river, would classify their impact as Category B under the World Bank Policy on Environ-
mental Assessment (OP4.01), requiring a partial Environmental Assessment (EA). A World
Bank Category B project is equivalent to the Government of Rwanda’s Schedule 2 projects.
5. I MPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS


Promoters seeking finance from the ESME project will have to submit a full project dossier to
the SEDP coordinator for review and eventually approval by the Steering Committee. One of the
criteria (see Annex 3 of the project paper) is the provision of an Environmental Impact Assess-
ment (EIA) including the approval of REMA or its designated agency. For all sub project pro-
posals the attached EMP checklist will be completed. All project proposals will have to be sub-
mitted for approval to the Bank including the EIA.


6. E NVIRONMENTAL SCREENING , ASSESSMENT AND M ANAGEMENT
A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and Environmental and Social Management Frame-
work (ESMF) have been prepared under the Electricity Access Scale up Project (EASP). These
frameworks are applicable to the SEDP and were publicly disclosed by the GoR and IDA in
January 2009. However, since the framework at the time did not anticipate the funding of micro
hydro-projects the operational manual for the SEDP will be amended to include the eligibility
criteria for sub-projects which include the preparation of an EIA in accordance with REMA re-
quirements. The Bank will review each EIA before a sub project is approved.

The SEDP and ESME project will benefit from the experience built within the existing Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) created for the SEDP project within EWSA. In the last two years, EW-
SA has expanded its environmental and social team.


7. Potential Environmental Impacts.
   The impacts are not expected to be significant but the Bank will review each EIA and the
   proposed mitigating measures to ensure that they are in compliance with the World Bank
   Operational Policies. Environmental Management Approach
REMA has a solid framework for EIAs in place, and in addition both the Steering Committee
and the Bank will review each sub project proposal
8. M ONITORING AND R EPORTING


Each sub project will have its own monitoring and reporting requirements, which will be consol-
idated and reported through the SEDP coordinator to the bank on a regular basis
