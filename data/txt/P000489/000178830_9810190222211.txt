INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CRAD
FOR A HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed de-
velopment credit to the Republic of Chad for the equivalent of US$3.5 million
on standard IDA terms, to help finance a project for highway improvement and
maintenance.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The report, "Chad's Economic Development:  Constraints and Poten-
tial" (75a-CD), of the economic mission which visited Chad in April/May 1972,
was distributed to the Executive Directors on July 2, 1973 (R73-191). A spe-
cial mission visited Chad in November 1973 to update our information on the
Government's financial situation; the findings of the mission are incorporated
in this report. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        With extremely poor natural resources, a harsh climate, a limited
infrastructure and a pervasive lack of skills, Chad faces unusually difficult
handicaps in its economic development. An additional difficulty is the high
cost of transport to the outside world; the main centers of activity of this
large land-locked country are located at 1,500 to 2,500 km from sea ports.
With a per capita GNP of $80 in 1971, Chad is classified by the United Nations
as one of the 25 least developed countries in the world.
4.        Most of the population - at least 90 percent - lives in rural areas,
deriving its livelihood from agriculture and livestock. About half of the
rural population lives in central Chad as semi-nomadic livestock herders who
exploit the Sahelian grasslands. The other half lives in the relatively higher
rainfall zone in the South, where they grow millet and sorghum as food crops
and cotton as a cash crop. Cotton accounts for more than 70 percent of re-
corded exports. A recent and relatively successful diversification effort
in the South is the introduction of rice growing on the flood plains of the
Logone River.
5.        In the first decade since independence in 1960, GDP grew by about
5 percent annually in current prices, and 2 percent in constant prices. The
most rapid growth took place in the market economy, mainly import substitu-
tion industries and services, while the growth of livestock and subsistence
crops probably did not exceed the population growth rate of 1.5 percent an-
nually. Accordingly, income disparities grew between the north and the south,
as well as between the small modern sector in the towns and the mAas of the
people in the rural areas.



6.        Since the late 1960's two events have affected Chad's grcwth and
fiscal performance - the rebellion and the drought. The rebellion which
broke out in 1968 made wide areas of the country insecure and cut off tradi-
tional cattle trading routes. Wells were neglected and the supply of water
for livestock dwindled. Earlier progress in animal disease control was lost.
The effects of the rebellion were compounded by droughts which occurred in
three of the last five years. Enormous losses of cattle have been reported,
cotton output dropped and shortages of basic foodstuffs occurred even in areas
which normally produce a surplus of food. Emergency food shipments from abroad
have thus far been able to avert widespread starvation.
7.        These factors have made the financial situation of the Government
precarious. Up to 1968, the Government's current budget had been in balance,
and considering the country's development constraints, the overall fiscal
performance appeared satisfactory. After 1968, however, expenditures started
to grow much more rapidly than receipts. Military outlays alone rose from
18 to 31 percent of the total budget outlays. The droughts further increased
the demand for Government services while reducing revenues. The overall
budget deficit rose from CFAF 1.6 billion in 1968 to 4.3 billion in 1972; it
is expected to have declined to CFAF 4.0 billion during fiscal year 1973.
Annual French budgetary subsidies have partly covered these deficits. How-
ever, a considerable financial gap remained, causing arrears on Government
payments to rise to CFAF 6.1 billion by September 1973.
8.        The fiscal situation constitutes a serious obstacle to development,
as Chad can finance neither the required capital nor all the recurrent expend-
itures of ongoing and new high priority projects. Even essential economic
services have had to be curtailed.   Chad's authorities agree with our assess-
ment of the fiscal problem and with the need to rehabilitate their public fi-
nances, re-examine current spending priorities and evenitually make a start
on generating public savings. The conclusions and recommendations of the
recent fiscal review mission have been transmitted to the Government. The
IMF, with whom we are in close contact on the matter, recently sent a mission
to Chad for consultations with the Government and is expected to report its
findings shortly. The outlook is that even with the best performance it will
be years before Chad can hope to overcome the fiscal constraint and generate
current budget surpluses.
9.        Chad's development potential lies in its rural areas.   Opportuni-
ties for productive employment in towas will remain small. Progress in the
rural economy, however, will be slow. Even assuming political stability and
normal rainfall, it will take many years and great efforts to restore the
productive capacity destroyed by years of rebellion and droughts.
10.       In view of Chad's very limited savings capacity, almost all of the
country's investment has been financed by external sources. Foreign aid re-
ceived during 1966-70 averaged $13 million a year, almost $4 per capita.
Most of the aid - 91 percent - consisted of grants. France and FED provided



- 3 -
the bulk of aid (about 40 and 30 percent respectively). Other aid donors
including the European Investment Bank and United Nations agencies made
smaller contributions. IDA credits during the period accounted for 4 percent
of total aid.
11.       External public debt outstanding and disbursed on December 31, 1971,
amounted to US$34.8 million; IDA credits represented a little over 5 percent
of this amount. In 1971 debt service was estimated at 8 percent of the export
earnings. After 1971, Chad has continued to receive grant aid from its
traditional sources of aid but to the best of our knowledge no major additions
to the debt were made. Chad reportedly did receive in 1973 pledges of aid
from the People's Republic of China and some Middle Eastern countries, but
these pledges, to our knowledge, have not yet been followed by specific Loan
agreements. Tentatively, it is estimated that by the end of the decade IDA's
share in Chad's external debt could rise to close to one-third. Taking into
account the concessionary nature of most of the assistance extended and in
prospect for Chad, the debt service ratio is likely to decline to less than
5 percent by that time.
12.       In the light of Chad's poverty and low per capita income, its
modest prospects for growth of GDP and exports of goods and non-factor serv-
ices, external borrowing should be, to the extent possible, on concessionary
terms. Furthermore, even with good fiscal performance, Chad will have neither
the free budgetary resources through the end of the 1970's to enable it to
pay its share of capital outlays, nor will it be able to afford substantial
new outlays for recurrent costs associated with new projects. In the next
few years, foreign aid agencies should therefore consider financing virtually
the total cost of projects, including, in the early years of project opera-
tion, a high proportion of current operating cost.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       Since 1968, when the first credit was made, the Bank Group has
extended five credits to Chad totalling US$13.2 million 1/ - one for highway
maintenance, two for education, one for livestock development and the fifth
credit for drought relief. A sixth credit of US$7.5 million to help finance
a rice irrigation project was approved by the Executive Directors at the end
of March 1974. The Association is waiting for an external debt letter from
the Government required for the signature of the Credit Agreement.
14.       With the exception of the highway maintenance credit (the Drought
Relief Credit has just become effective), disbursements and project implemen-
tation are behind schedule, principally as a result of the Government's in-
ability to finance its contribution. In recognition of the Government's
1/   Includes supplementary financing of US$0.9 million approved in August
1973 for the two education projects.



tight budgetary position, which has been aggravated by the drought, and to
offset the effects of the devaluation of the US dollar, the Executive Di-
rectors approved in August of last year supplementary financing for the two
ongoing education projects to provide for 100 percent financing of total
project costs net of duties and taxes. Similarly, in December last year the
Executive Directors approved 100 percent financing for the livestock project
and the creation of a revolving account from the proceeds of the credit for
pre-financing project expenditures. Annex II contains a summary statement of
IDA credits as of April 30, 1974 and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
15.       Apart from the Government's budgetary constraints, the scarcity of
well-prepared projects is one other major factor that has so far militated
against a substantial expansion of Bank Group operations in Chad. Conse-
quently the Bank has concentrated its efforts on assisting the Government
(in many cases in cooperation with other aid agencies) in identifying and
preparing new projects in key sectors, while at the same time trying to
ensure successful implementation of ongoing projects. These efforts are
gradually paying off in the form of a growing pipeline of suitable projects,
mainly in transportation and agriculture.
16.       In keeping with the Government's development priorities, the Bank
Group's lending strategy to Chad continues to focus on agriculture (including
livestock), transportation and education - the key sectors of the economy.
The Livestock Development Unit, established under the first IDA project with
UNDP financing, is expected to be a helpful instrument for the identification
and preparation of further projects for possible Bank Group financing in this
highly important sub-sector of the economy. Another project, prepared with
FAC financing, is the Lake Chad Polders project for smallholder cotton and
wheat production; Government has requested IDA financing and other aid agen-
cies (FAC, USAID and ADF) have expressed interest in co-financing.
17.       In transportation, priority is being given by the Bank Group to the
improvement of crop marketing roads. To this end, a two-phase improvement
program for cotton roads is planned. The first phase is the object of the
present credit. The second phase would cover the improvement of roads used
for transporting cotton fiber from ginneries to export outlets and its prepara-
tion will be financed under the first phase project.
18.       In the field of education, we are reviewing the reDort of a study
(financed under an existing IDA credit) on a possible project for the train-
ing of young farmers.
PART III - TRANSPORT IN CHAD
19.       Chad is a vast and land-locked country.   N'Djamena, its capital
city, though also located in the south is at a considerable distance from
the cotton growing areas near Moundou and Sarh. It is also located at about



- 5 -
2,000 km from sea ports, making export-import trade dependent upon long routes
outside the country. Thus, transport costs play a critical role in Chad's
economy and the lack of adequate transport infrastructure constitutes a major
obstacle to its development; high transport costs make exports less competitive
and inflate the domestic prices of imports.
20.       For its external trade, Chad relies on the transport routes of
neighboring countries without exclusive dependence on any one of them. These
routes are the transequatorial road/river/rail system to the Congolese ocean
port of Pointe Noire; the transcameroon road/rail route to the Cameroonian
port of Douala; and the Nigerian route by road to Maiduguri and then by rail
to the coast.
21.       The internal transport system consists of a simple network dominated
by roads; air and water transport have only minor local significance. The
road network consists of about 7,200 km of classified roads (only 240 km are
paved), and about 25,000 km of earth tracks which provide connections to agri-
cultural areas. The network is unevenly distributed and its condition is
generally poor. In addition, nine ferry boats, all over 30 years old, located
on main roads in the cotton growing area and/or international routes, are in
poor condition, thus aggravating the poor transport infrastructure in the
area. These ferry boats frequently break down, causing protracted delays in
transportation of cotton and goods.
22.       A Road Fund established in 1960 and already partly utilized 1mder
the first highway project could generate sufficient funds for road maintenance
purposes if it were regularly fed with revenues from fuel taxes. However, the
allocations made for road maintenance have always been lower than the revenues
actually collected from fuel taxes because receipts are deposited in the
Central Treasury where they are absorbed into the general budget. These in-
adequate budget allocations have only allowed maintenance of primary roads,
leaving important feeder roads in the cotton growing areas not even minimally
maintained. To ensure improved control over the Road Fund, the Government
has agreed (a) to maintain in its Central Bank a separate account for the
Road Fund; (b) to allocate to the Road Fund the amounts collected from fuel
taxes and ferry boat tolls; and (c) to allocate from the proceeds of the Road
Fund the amount budgeted for road maintenance and operating costs of the ferry
boats (Sec. 4.03 of the draft Credit Agreement). Budgets for road maintenance
and for operating of ferry boats would be established following annual con-
sultation with the Association (Sec. 4.04 of the draft Credit Agreement).
23.       The Bank Group's contribution to the development of Chad's interna-
tional routes has been mainly through improvement of port, railway and road
systems in the neighboring countries. Projects have been financed or are
under consideration in Cameroon and Congo. For internal transport, priority
has been given to road maintenance and in this context the Bank Group's first
lending to Chad (Credit 125-CD, US$4.1 million, August 1968) helped finance a
five-year road maintenance program.



- 6 -
24.       Until 1972, DPW 1/ was only responsible for administration and
maintenance of the primary road network (about 4,600 km); the secondary system
(about 2,600 km) was under the jurisdiction of local authorities. However,
because of staffing difficulties and financial constraints, the local authori-
ties were unable to carry out the maintenance required on the road system
assigned to them.  The Government therefore decided to centralize responsibility
for this network under DPW so as to ensure better administration and mainte-
nance of the roads. Thus, in 1973 DPW assumed responsibility for about half
of the secondary system, and it is expected to take over the remainder during
1974.
25.       DPW is adequately staffed, with senior positions held by French
engineers under a long-term technical assistance agreement with FAC. Grad-
uates of the Ecole Nationale des Travaux Publics (ENTP) at N'Djamena will en-
sure the future availability of local civil engineers. However, there is a
shortage of adequately trained lower-level specialized personnel (e.g., plant
operators, mechanics, equipment overseers and foremen). A training program
drawn up under the first highway project to meet this problem was, however,
not executed because the cost of its implementation would have exceeded the
funds available under the credit. The proposed project includes a new com-
prehensive training program for all the above-mentioned categories of
specialized personnel.
26.       Besides the need to improve the transport infrastructure, a major
effort is required for the improvement of the transport industry in general
and the trucking sector in particular. The lack of coordination among
carriers and customers, together with the imbalance in tonnages carried for
export and import traffic, have had the effect of reducing the average vehicle
load factor for road transport to about 50 percent, and creating high unit
costs for such transport. The present high tariffs are also largely a result
of the monopolistic structure of the industry whereby one company carries most
of the freight. Since no improvement of the existing situation can be expected
as long as the Ministry of Transport (which is responsible for transport
policy and coordination) lacks the personnel qualified to study the problems
related to road transport, outside assistance is required. The proposed
project would provide such assistancethrough the services of a transport
economist to be attached to the Ministry of Transport to study the critical
aspects of the road transport industry and to make proposals for its reorgani-
zation.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
27.       The proposed project has evolved from a Government request that the
Association participate, along with FAC and FED, in the financing of a five-
year (1973-77) cotton development program in southern Chad. While FAC and
FED have proceeded with the financing of the cotton development program, the
proposed project would provide improvement of the infrastructure which will
contribute to the success of the program. It was identified by our Permanent
Mission in West Africa in 1972 and the feasibility study, financed by FAC,
was completed in 1973 by French consultants, BCEOM. The project was appraised
in October/November 1973 by a Bank mission. Negotiations for the proposed
credit were held from April 29 to May 4, 1974 in N'Djamena with a Cliadian
delegation led by Mr. Ahmed Ngakoutou, Director of DPW. A report entitled
"Chad: ApLraisal of a Second Highway Project" (No. 381a-CD), dated May 28,
1974 is being distributed separately and a Credit and Project Summary is
attached to this report as Annex III.
28.       The proposed project consists of:
(a) a five-year program for improvement and maintenance of about
800 km of feeder roads in cotton growing areas;
(b)  preinvestment studies for the improvement of about 120 km of
secondary roads connecting cotton growing areas with the main
export routes;
(c) a two-year training program for DPW staff;
(d) technical assistance to the Ministry of Transport for reor-
ganization of the road transport industry;
(e) a two-year traffic count on about 2,000 km of the most impor-
tant and heavily trafficked roads in the country;
(f) reconditioning of nine ferry boats and their interim maintenance
over a three year period; and
(g) a feasibility study for replacement of ferry boats and improve-
ments of dock facilities.
Organization and Execution
29.       The improvement and maintenance works for roads would be carried
out by force account; in view of the scattered nature of operations and the
need for flexibility in carrying them out this method would provide tho least-
cost solution. These works would be carried out by four teams, one for
reshaping, one for regravelling and two for structural works.



30.       DPW would have overall responsibility for the entire operation.
However, because its scarce staff is already charged with the maintenance of
primary roads and is also becoming increasingly involved in the maintenance
of secondary roads, the Government and the cornultants believe that it would
be more realistic to assign management of the work teams to COTONTCHAD 1/
which has qualified personniel and adequate equipment maintenance facilities.
DPW would own the equipment purchased under the, proposed project, while
COTONTCHAD would, under a contract acceptable to the Association to be
concluded between DPW and COTONTCHAD, provide the personnel needed for the
four work teams and for equipment maintenance. The contract would specify
the details for reimbursement of COTONTCHAD's direct costs, such as labor,
materials, fuel, lubricants, spare parts, etc. An outside expert would be
engaged by DPW and seconded to COTONTCHAD to organize and supervise the works
assisted by a local engineer who would, after two years, replace the expert.
31.       While the improvement of the feeder roads used for transporting
seed cotton to the ginneries is the first priority, it is necessary also to
improve the roads used for transporting cotton fiber from ginneries to main
export outlets. Consequently, the proposed project includes provision for
pre-investment studies for the improvement of two such roads and the construc-
tion of a bridge on a third road.
32.       The training program for DPW staff whidc was prepared by consultants
ORT (Switzerland) under the first highway project, but which was not implemented
due to insufficient funds, is now included in this project. It provides for
technical assistance and the purchase of tools and workshop equipment for the
trainees and for routine equipment maintenance. Training would be done
essentially on the job, with teams of trainees maintaining some road sections
assigned to them and also the equipment used to carry out the road maintenance.
This practical training would be complemented by theoretical courses. An
important feature of the program would be the training of local counterpart
staff who could replace the experts at the end of the program. Provision of
fellowships for study abroad would also be included in the program.
33.       The technical assistant to be assigned to the Ministry of Transport
for the reorganization of the road transport industry would, over a period of
nine months, evaluate the problems of road transport and advance proposals
for solving them.
34.       Traffic counts would be carried out by DPW and financing would be
provided under the project for the necessary operating costs, including hir-
ing of vehicles.
35.       The project also includes a provision for procurement of major equip-
ment items for reconditioning and maintenance of ferry boats, fcr materials for
their maintenance over three years as well as funds for a feasibility study

Government. It has a monopoly of processing and marketing cotton in Chad.

to determine the extent of nev investments required. The reconditioning and
maintenance would be performed by DPW. The feasibility study would be carried
out by a consultant who would, over a period of three months, evaluate the
ferry boat problem and submit an economically justified program for replace-
ment of ferry boats and improvement of dock facilities.
Project Cost
36.       The total cost of the project, net of taxes, is estimated at about
US$3.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of US$2.65 million
(76 percent). Details of cost estimates are summarized below. All estimates
reflect expected prices at end-1974.

Financing
37.       For the reasons explained in Part I, and as an exceptional measure,
the proposed IDA credit would cover the total cost of the project, net of
taxes. To ensure that the maintenance of feeder roads is continued once the
five-year program is completed, the Government has agreed to include all
feeder roads of the project in DPW's normal annual maintenance program (Sec.
4.04 of the draft Credit Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
38.       Road and ferry boat maintenance equipment would be procured on the
basis of international competitive b:idding in accordance with Bank/IDA guide-
lines; construction materials, ferry boat maintenance materials, workshop
equipment and tools would be procured under procedures consistent with IDA
guidelines, provided that with regard to invitations to bid, advertisements
may be limited to newspapers of general circulation in Chad. The signing
of the contract between the Department of Public Works of the Ministere des
Travaux Publics et de l'Amenagement du Territoire and COTONTCHIAD for the
execution of the road improvement and maintenance works would be a condition
of disbursement on expenditures for equipment and materials as well as operat-
ing costs for road improvement and maintenance.
Benefits and Justification
39.       The benefits of the project would primarily consist of savings in
vehicle operating costs which are expected to increase from CFAF 58.3 million
in FY76 to CFAF 84.6 million in FY85. COTONTCHAD, which owns and operates
the trucks used to transport the cotton crop, would be the major beneficiary.
Most of these benefits would eventually be transferred to the farmers either
in the form of higher cotton prices, or as contributions to the cotton develop-
ment program through the Cotton Stabilization Fund to which, under existing
arrangements, COTONTCHAD is required to transfer 80 percent of its profits.
40.       In addition, there is a strong indication that if the feeder roads
were not improved, planned increases in cotton production would not be achieved.
The present condition of the feeder roads results in lengthy delays in the
production process when vehicles break down and cannot deliver seed, fertilizer,
pesticides, and other agricultural inputs required by farmers. Cotton yields
are very sensitive to the timing of sowing, spraying, and fertilizing. Improve-
ment of the existing feeder roads would help ensure that these inputs reach
the farmers on time and would also enable agricultural extension service staff
to reach more farmers; furthermore, economic activity in general would be en-
couraged and the standard of living of the farmers raised through an improve-
ment of communications in remote rural areas.
41.       If only vehicle operating cost savings are considered, the economic
return from the cotton feeder road project is estimated at 9.2 percent. How-
ever, since the feeder roads are part of the cotton development program, the
estimation of the economic rate of return should take into account the expected



- 11 -
increase in cotton production attributable to the road project. If it is
assumed that as little as 2.5 percent of the net value of the incremental
cotton production is attributable to this project, the economic rate of return
would be about 18 percent. If the project contributes 5 percent of incremental
production, the estimated return increases to 25 percent. The probability
that the agricultural output attributable to the project would be less than
2.5 percent of the net value of incremental production is considered remote.
42.       The economic return was also tested for sensitivity to cost escala-
tions. Price inflation is considered to affect both costs and benefits
similarly and therefore not to affect the estimated rate of return.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Chad
and the Association, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approv-
ing the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern for highway
maintenance projects.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

C.   PROJECrS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 125 Highway Maintenance Project: US$4.1 million Credit of
August 14, 1968: Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project consists of (a) a '-year program for nighway maintenance
including technical assistance, the procurement of equipment and materials,
repair shop extension, training of operators and mechanlcs, and establishment
of traffic data collection system; and (b) studies for the imDrovement of the
Djermaya-Djimtilo road. After an initial delay in procuring equipment, the
maintenance program has progressed fairly satisfactorily. However, budgetary
constraints, aggravated by the drought, required some reduction of the program.
The training program was not implemented as planned because the cost
of the consultants' proposals exceeded the amount available under the credit.
However, a comprehensive training program is included in the second highway
project. The feasibility study for improvement of the Djermaya-Djimtilo road
has been completed; however, detailed engineering, found premature, has been
deferred due to present low traffic volumes.
Credit No. 126 Education Project: US$2.2 million Credit of August 29, 1968
(as amended); Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The project consists of (a) the construction and equipping of a
teacher training college at Ml'undou and (b) the construction and equipping of
an agricultural technician training center at N'Djamena 2/ (transferred to
Sarh 3/ under Credit 251).
Project implementation is about 1 1/2 years behind schedule due to
(a) delay in reaching agreement on design which had to be revised because of
cultural technician training center; and (c) delay caused by internal budget
difficulties and cost overruns caused by underestimation and US dollar devalua-
tion. The construction of the teacher training college was completed in
December 1973 in spite of difficulties in the supply of materials. The con-
struction of the agricultural technician training center is expected to start
shortly.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

The Credit Agreement was amended in August 1973 to provide for (a)
100 percent IDA financing of the project, net of duties and taxes; (b) a
supplementary credit of US$400,000 equivalent to cover the effect of the US
dollar devaluation and increased IDA financing; (c) reduction in enrollment,
boarding capacity and staff housing for the teacher training college, and
a reduction in boarding capacity for the agricultural technician training
center. A mission to review progress on this project is scheduled to visit
Chad at the end of May.
Credit No. 251 Second Education Project; US$2.7 million Credit of June 16, 1971;
(as amended); Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project consists of (a) the construction and equipping of a
secondary technical school at N'Djamena; (b) conversion of an existing tech-
nical school into a vocational training center at Sarh; (c) the transfer of
the agricultural technician training center, financed under Credit 126, from
N'Djamena to Sarh; and (d) a study of young farmers training schemes.
Project implementation is about 12 months behind schedule due to
(a) delay in reaching agreement on the schedule of accommodation for the
secondary technical school; (b) delay in reducing the cost overruns related
to the agricultural technician training center; and (c) delay caused by
internal budget difficulties and cost overruns arising from underestimation
and the devaluation of the US dollar.
Architectural designs for the secondary technical school, drawn up
by the consulting architects, have been approved by the Association and the
bidding documents are expected to be finalized shortly. The study of young
farmers training schemes has been completed and the report submitted to the
Bank and the Government. The Credit Agreement was amended in August 1973 to
provide for (a) 100 percent IDA financing of the project, net of duties and
taxes (b) a supplementary credit of US$500,000 to offset the effects of the
devaluation of the US dollar and increased IDA financing; (c) reduction in
boarding capacity and staff housing for the secondary technical school; (d)
deletion of the vocational training center at Sarh; and (e) provision of
additional equipment for an existing vocational training center at N'Djamena.
A mission to review progress on this project is scheduled to visit Chad at
the end of May.
Credit No. 309 Livestock Development Project: US$2.2 million Credit of
May 31, 1972: Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project comprises: (a) the construction of 38 new stock wells
and the repair and renovation of 102 existing wells in the Batha prefecture;
(b) the establishment of two well maintenance units, including their operating
costs for the first two years; (c) support for the Livestock Development
Unit (LDU) established with UNDP assistance.

Project execution is behind schedule for several reasons, principally
lack of a Project Authority, counterpart funds and time consuming administrative
procedures in Chad. In February 1974, Dyckmans and Company, the firm selected
for the construction and repair of wells withdrew its bid and IDA agreed in
principle to awarding of the contract to the second lowest bidder, SATOM,
provided that SATOM's revised offer is reasonable. Construction works are
now expected to start in October 1974, after the rainy season. The LDU is
only now beginning to function because of the delay in reaching agreement on
the terms of reference.  Further delay resulted from the difficulty encountered
in the recruitment of staff for the unit.
The Executive Directors have approved an increase in IDA financing
to 100 percent of total project costs, net of duties and taxes, and the
establishment of a revolving account. A mission is scheduled to visit Chad
early in June to review progress on this project.
Credit No. 445 Drought Relief Fund Project; US$2.0 million Credit of
December 7, 1973: Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The project is designed to help people in areas affected by the
drought to re-establish their productive base; it comprises the following
sub-projects: equipment, workshops, technical assistance and operating costs
for underground water development; equipment and operating costs for "Genie
Rural," Water Development Department, and Land Development Department; equip-
ment, buildings and operating costs for the Livestock Service; construction
of grain storage facilities; equipment and operating costs for a vegetable
growing pilot scheme; and equipment and operating costs for the Planning
Department. Tender documents have been approved for all the sub-projects
except the vegetable growing pilot scheme. The Association is financing
100 percent of total project cost, excluding duties and taxes, and a revolving
account has been established in the Development Bank of Chad for prefinancing
project expenditures. A mission is scheduled to visit Chad early in June to
review progress on this project.
