THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Internal transport in Tanzania is made difficult by the great
distances which separate populated areas and economic centers. The pre-
dominant mode of transport for many years was the railway which trausports
mo6t exports and imports. Over the past decade, however, increasing em-
phasis has been placed on regional development and the Government has em-
barked on an ambitious program of road construction and improvement. Under
the Bank Group's first and second highway projects, undertaken in 1964 and
1969, almost 1,400 km of primary and secondary roads have been or are being
improved.
ii.       Start of the first highway project was quite slow, largely because
of a shortage of staff in the Ministry of Communications, Transport and
Labour (COMWORKS); later, execution proceeded satisfactorily and engineer-
ing and construction are now complete. The staffing and training program,
included in the project when it was revised in 1968, is underway. Construc-
tion of the Tan-Zam highway under the second highway project is proceeding
well, and works are about 75% complete.
iii.      While primary roads will continue to absorb the major portion
of expenditures for highways, a growing portion of funds is being allocated
to the development of agricultural roads in rural areas where the inadequacy
of feeder roads is hindering development. Government plans call for the
betterment of feeder roads wherever agricultural potential is identified.
iv.       The third highway project, partly prepared through studies fi-
nanced under the first highway project, is designed to assist the Govern-
ment in its ongoing program of primary road improvement, and to initiate
the betterment of agricultural feeder roads. The project consists of the
following: (a) bituminous paving of the existing gravel road between Mtwara
and Masasi (200 km), (b) betterment of 475 km of agricultural feeder roads
in the Geita district and in the Mara region, (c) preinvestment studies for
road improvements, (d) construction supervision and training by consultants,
and (e) continuation of the staffing and training program in COMWORKS. The
total cost of the project is estimated at US$9.5 million equivalent. The
proposed credit of US$6.5 million will cover the foreign exchange component,
i.e. about 68% of total project costs.
v.        The Roads and Aerodromes Division (RAD) of COMWORKS will be
responsible for execution of the project. It will be assisted by consul-
tants employed on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association. Con-
struction of the Mtwara-Masasi road will be by contract, awarded after
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines.
Under the project, equipment will be purchased for two betterment and main-
tenance units which will be established for the betterment of agricultural
feeder roads. The betterment works will be carried out by RAD forces,
trained and supervised by consultants.



- ii -
Vi.       The project is economically sound and of high priority.  On the
balsis of savings in vehicle operating costs and road maintenance costs, im-
provement of the Mtwara-Masasi road is expected to yield an economic return
of 14%. Economic justification of the agricultural feeder road betterment
program is based on net benefits to be derived from induced agricultural pro-
duction after allowance for the costs of both road betterment works and agri-
cultural inputs are taken into account. The economic return expected on the
Geita cotton development scheme is estimated at 21% and the economic return
on the Mara dairy scheme is estimated at 28%.
vii.      The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$6.5
million equivalent to the United Republic of Tanzania.



TANZANIA
APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The project has evolved from a number of preinvestment studies
which were carried out in Tanzania over the past few years. A feasibility
study, carried out in 1968 by the consultants, United Research Inc. (US) and
financed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
recommended paving of the Mtwara-Masasi road (200 km). In September 1970,
the Government commissioned the Swedish Consulting Group (SWECO) to carry
out (a) detailed engineering for this paving work and (b) feasibility studies
and preliminary engineering for improvement of the Masasi-Songea road (454 km).
The study of the Masasi-Songea road is not sufficiently advanced to consider
including these improvement works in the present project, but the engineering
work on the Mtwara-Masasi road is substantially completed and paving of this
section has been found to be justified.
1.02      Detailed engineering for the construction of secondary roads in
the cotton growing area of the Geita district was undertaken by the British
consultants, Sir William Halcrow and Partners, as part of the project fi-
nanced by Credit 115-TA in 1968. Because the engineering revealed higher
costs than had been estimated at the time the original feasibility study
was carried out, the economic justification for this construction was re-
viewed in the fall of 1970 by a research unit from the University of Dar
es Salaam and by the Planning Division of the Ministry of Communications,
Transport and Labour (COMWORKS). Their studies revealed that construction
of these roads would be too costly for the traffic volumes carried, but
that the existing roads could be upgraded to acceptable service levels
through minor construction and betterment works and improved maintenance.
1.03      In 1969, United Research Inc. carried out feasibility studies,
with financing from USAID, for the betterment of feeder roads in six
agricultural areas. The Government, in consultation with the Association,
selected from these, two areas of high agricultural potential - the Mara
and Mbulu regions - and, in October 1970, asked the consultants, Sir Alexander
Gibb and Partners (UK), to carry out the preliminary engineering for better-
ment of about 300 km of feeder roads in these regions. The Mara roads were
found to be suitable for a pilot betterment operation, but betterment of the
few and scattered roads in the Mbulu region could more appropriately be
undertaken as part of an overall maintenance program.
1.04      Based on the results of the various studies, a project suitable
for IDA financing has been identified. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$9.5 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component
of US$6.5 million or 68%.
1.05      Two other road projects are presently under consideration by the
Government. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has
agreed to finance a study of the link from Arusha to Mwanza (about 500 km)



- 2 -
and has invited proposals from consultants; the study is expected to be
completed before the end of 1972. Japan is financing a feasibility study,
which is expected to be completed later this year, of a coastal link between
Dar es Salaam and Mtwara (about 400 km).
1.06      This will be the third highway project financed by the Bank Group
in Tanzania. The first highway project was financed by a US$14.0 million
credit (48-TA) in 1964 supplemented by a US$3.0 million credit (115-TA)
in 1968. The project, as revised in 1968, consisted of the construction
of six road sections totalling 880 km; the detailed engineering of a
234 km section of the Tan-Zam highway (now being constructed under the
second highway project) and of 335 km of aecondary roads in the Geita
district; and initiation of a staffing and training program for COMWORKS.
After a very slow start, engineering and construction under this first
highway project have been satisfactorily completed; the staffing and train-
ing program is underway and will be continued under the present project.
The second highway project is being financed by an IDA credit (142-TA) of
US$15.5 million, a Bank loan (586-TA) of US$7.0 million, and a Swedish
credit of US$7.5 million equivalent, all made in 1969. This second project,
which consists of the reconstruction of a 510 km section of the Tan-Zam
highway, is about 75% complete and is being carried out efficiently.  The
reconstruction of other portions of this link between the copper belt in
Zambia and Dar es Salaam is being financed by USAID in Tanzania, and by a
UK grant and Bank loans (469-ZA and 563-ZA) in Zambia.  The works in Zambia
were completed in 1969.  The Bank Group financed section in Tanzania is ex-
pected to be completed by the end of 1971.
1.07      Other loans for transportation include two (110-EA of US$24.0
million in 1955 and 428-EA of US$38.0 million in 1965) to the former East
African Common Services Authority for the improvement of equipment and
facilities operated by the former East African Railways and Harbours
Administration. In 1969, a Bank loan of US$35.0 million (638-EA) was made
to the newly created East African Harbours Corporation, and in 1970, a loan
of US$42.4 million (674-EA) was made to the new East African Railways
Corporation (EARC). Execution of these projects, although somewhat slow
in starting, is proceeding satisfactorily.
1.08      This report is based on the studies mentioned above, the work of
the Permanent Mission in Eastern Africa (PMEA) which assisted the Government
in preparing the project, and the findings of a mission consisting of Messrs.
F. Soges, R. H. Snel (engineers), H. Brandreth and D. Jovanovic (economists)
which visited Tanzania in December 1970. The report was edited by Miss J.
Murphy.

2. BACKGROUND
A. Economic Setting
2.01      Tanzania is situated in East Africa a few degrees south of the
equator. It has a land area of about 940,000 km2, a large part of which
is a high, arid plateau. The population of about 12.9 million is heavily
concentrated near the three main Indian Ocean ports of Dar es Salaam, Tanga
and Mtwara and in a few agricultural areas which, for the most part, are
located on the periphery of the country; i.e. the Lake Victoria region, the
highlands around Kilimanjaro, and the southern highlands. While the popula-
tion is growing at a high rate of 2.7% annually, the central region remains
largely unsettled. The great distances between populated areas make the
provision of adequate transport facilities difficult.
2.02      Over the period 1966-1969, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew
at an average rate of about 4.5% annually to reach a per capita level of
about US$75 equivalent; real per capita income has been growing at only
about 2.2% per annum. Agriculture is the principal economic activity,
accounting for over 40% of GDP in 1969. About half of total production is
consumed for subsistence; the main cash crops are cotton, coffee and
sisal which together account for most export trade. Diamonds and gold are
also sold abroad but exploitation of other known minerals is limited, partly
because of the great distance to markets. A small but rapidly growing
industrial sector accounts for about 7.5% of GDP.
2.03      The Government's second Five-Year Development Plan (1969/70-1973/74)
stresses agricultural development, allocating nearly one-fourth of total
expenditure directly to this sector. In addition, a small but increasing
portion of expenditures In the highway sector is intended to stimulate agri-
cultural production. The Plan puts high priority on crop diversification,
particularly import substitution crops such as sugar, wheat and rice. One
of the most promising examples of crop diversification to date has been the
steady increase in cashew nut production in the south.
B. The Transport System
2.04      The transport system consists of about 33,900 km of roads, 2,500
km of the East Africa Railway system, three ocean ports, coastal shipping
and regularly scheduled air services. The transport system must fulfill
three basic needs:
(a) connect the widely-scattered population centers;
(b) facilitate the movement of exports and imports
to and from the ports; and
(c) provide access to the sea for neighboring, landlocked
countries.



2.05      The highway network consists of about 16,900 km of primary and
secondary roads, of which only about 20% are all-weather paved or gravel
roads, and about 17,000 km of roads of lower standards. Road connections
between populated areas are being improved but the system still requires
development, particularly of the low standard earth and gravel roads which
are presently suitable only for dry-weather movements.
2.06      The railway network is concentrated in the central and northern
part of the country. There are two main lines: one from Kigoma on Lake
Ta.nganyika to Dar es Salaam (1,256 km) with an important branch to Mwanza
on Lake Victoria (380 km); and the second from Arusha to Tanga (440 km),
which also connects with the Kenyan port of Mombasa. A 188 km rail link
along the coast connects these two lines. Burundi, and to a small extent
Rwanda, rely on the rail line from Kigoma. The lack of adequate transport
facilities in the southern half of the country, which is not presently
served by the railway, has retarded development of this potentially pro-
ductive area, but construction of the Tan-Zam highway and of the Tan-Zam
railway, though basically designed to serve Zambian transit traffic, should
help to stimulate the growth and development of this area.
2.07      Three Tanzanian ports - Dar es Salaam, Tanga and Mtwara - as
well as Mombasa in Kenya serve Tanzania's and its land-locked neighbors'
export/import traffic. The tonnage of the three Tanzanian ports in 1969
was about 2.8 million tons, with Dar es Salaam handling about 86% of
the total and Tanga about 12%. Although coastal shipping is playing a
declining role generally, it remains important in the region between Dar es
Salaam and Mtwara because of the lack of an all-weather land connection.
Shipping on Lakes Victoria and Tanganyika also plays a valuable role in
maintaining communications.
2.08      Passenger transport by air is important, especially to remote
areas, because of Tanzania's overall size, but air freight has not yet
developed to a significant degree. Some 20 airports are utilized for
scheduled flights, and services are maintained by the East African Airways
Corporation, owned and operated by the East African Community. One inter-
national airport exists at Dar es Salaam and another is being constructed
at Arusha.
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
2.D9      For many years, transport policy was directed almost exclusively
toward the requirements of external trade, and emphasis has therefore been
on railway development, with roads seen primarily as a complement and
feeder to the rail system. While the movement of export/import traffic
remains an important need, transport policy in recent years is giving
increasing emphasis to regional development. The Government has therefore
embarked on an ambitious program to improve primary roads and, more recently,
is stressing the development of roads serving rural areas. The growing
interest, as well, in improved connections with neighboring countries is
reElected in the ongoing construction of the Tan-Zam highway and railway.



2.10      In the past, as part of the policy of railway development, the
railways enjoyed protection from road competition through restrictive
licensing of road transport on routes parallel with the railway. The East
Africa Transport Survey (1969), which was financed by the United Nations De-
velopment Programme (UNDP) with the Bank as executing agency, concluded that
competition between road and rail, rather than protection of the railway,
offered the more economic solution to coordination between modes, and recom-
mended that the restrictive road licensing practices and differential railway
tariffs be abolished. Under the terms of the 1970 Bank loan (674-EA) to the
EARC, the Governments of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda have agreed to reduce
restrictive road licensing practices with respect to goods and to permit the
EARC greater freedom in establishing rates in order to meet the growing road
transport competition resulting from the more liberal road transport policy.
The railway management's performance with respect to this undertaking has
been satisfactory.
2.11      In Tanzania, the question of permitting unlimited scope for road
transport services has been approached cautiously by the Government, since
such a policy rests on free market competition between rail and road and
among road operators which the Government believes may conflict with its
policy of socialism and government ownership. A Government-owned National
Transport Company has been created to control the Zambia-Tanzania Road Ser-
vices Ltd., which provides the bulk of road transport services for Zambian
exports and imports via Dar es Salaam, and the Dar es Salaam Motor Transport
Company (an urban bus service) as well as a number of shipping lines and an
air charter firm. The nationalization of other important road transport ele-
ments is also being considered.  The Government has tentatively proposed to
expand the activities of this organization into the field of inter-regional
road transport by taking over existing long-distance operations now largely
owned and operated by foreign interests or agents, but no firm policy has
yet evolved. It has requested financing from the UNDP for a study of the
implications of the proposed nationalization policy and the most suitable
course of action with respect to the development of the National Transport
Company.
3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Highway Network
3.01      Of the nearly 33,900 km of primary, secondary and agricultural
feeder roads (see Table 1), only approximately 2,200 km are bituminous
paved (an additional 800 km are under construction on the Tan-Zam highway)
and another 1,100 km have been built to engineered gravel standard. The
remainder are low standard gravel and earth roads. Except for the Tan-
Zam highway, most of the engineered roads are located in the coastal region
near Dar es Salaam and Tanga and in the Arusha and Lake Victoria areas.
The density of the network is 36 km per 1,000 km2 and 2.8 km per 1,000
inhabitants.



- 6 -
3.02      The large proportion of low-standard roads is a result of the
emphasis which was put on maximum mileage rather than quality when the
system was being developed. More recently, some of the main roads connect-
ing the principal centers of population have been improved, but, with
the continuing growth of road transport, further development of the network
is necessary. Primary roads must be improved or reconstructed if traffic
growth is not to be inhibited, and agricultural feeder roads must be
extended and upgraded in order to assure reliable and efficient access to
market. The Bank Group's assistance in the highway sector has emphasized
primary and secondary road development to date. While continuing to
assist the Government in this aspect of its highway program, the proposed
project will start the development of an adequate feeder road network.
B. Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic
3.03      The vehicle fleet (Table 2) grew at about 11% annually from 1962
to 1969, at which time there were about 75,300 vehicles in circulation, or
about one motor vehicle per 171 inhabitants. In 1969, passenger cars were
about 40% of the fleet; heavy vehicles such as trucks, truck/trailers and
buses, about 27%; and light commercial vehicles, about 16%. There has been
a marked trend to larger trucks and buses over the years; between 1961 and
1966, for example, the carrying capacity of the average truck increased
over 11%.
3.04      The licensing pattern for truck transport distinguishes between
public carriers providing for-hire transport, and private carriers limited
to the haulage of the carrier's own goods. Private carriers receive
licenses freely and outnumber public carriers by more than 3:1. In public
haulage, the vast majority (92%) of license holders operate only one
vehicle, while 17 large operators (about 1%) average over 30 vehicles
apiece and account for 20% of the entire public carrier fleet and 25% of
its capacity (these figures are exclusive of the carriers involved in
Tanzania-Zambia transit traffic). A similar pattern is applicable to bus
operations. About 96% of the carriers operate only two-thirds of the
vehicles, with an average of less than two buses per licensee. Five large
carriers operate 20% of all buses.
3.05      Little specific information is available on road transport traffic
patterns in Tanzania other than the well-publicized Zambia transit movements.
Traffic counts have been taken by COMWORKS for a number of years but the
reliability of the figures produced is questionable. A newly organized
traffic counting team is currently making reliable traffic counts, but
these are not sufficiently advanced in coverage at this point to indicate
national patterns for planning purposes.
C. Highway Administration
3.06      The Roads and Aerodromes Division (RAD) of COMWORKS has overall
responsibility for construction and maintenance of primary and secondary
roads, and has recently begun to take over responsibility for feeder roads
from the District Councils. The RAD works closely with other divisions of



-7-
COMWORKS in carrying out its activities: it rents its equipment from the
Electrical and Mechanical Division; relies on the Materials and Research
Division for soils and materials testing; and cooperates with the Planning
Division in assessing investment priorities. The RAD field activities,
which are carried out by the 17 regional offices of COMWORKS, are sometimes
hampered by difficulties experienced by the Electrical and Mechanical Divi-
sion in obtaining spare parts.
3.07      Lack of competent and experienced engineers has adversely affected
COMWORKS' performance, especially in road maintenance. The Government is
continually trying to engage new personnel, either locally or abroad. Qual-
ified engineers were recruited recently under the Government's staffing pro-
gram, supported in part by Credit 115-TA, and bilateral technical assistance
from Canada has further eased the staffing situation. While COMWORKS' staff-
ing has improved significantly, it will have to continue to rely on external
technical assistance since the number of qualified Tanzanian nationals will
remain inadequate for many years.
D. Nighway Expenditures and Planning
3.08      Total expenditures for highways rose from T Sh 66 million (US$9.2
million equivalent) in 1965/66 to T Sh 210 million (US$29.4 million equiva-
lent) in 1969/70 (Table 3). This substantial increase reflects both the
ambitious highway construction program undertaken by the Government, partic-
ularly the first and second Bank Group highway projects, and the considerable
increase in maintenance expenditures, largely necessitated by the increased
Zambian transit traffic since 1966.
3.09      The second Five-Year Development Plan (1969/70-1973/74) allocates
a total of about US$125 million equivalent to the highway sector. Of this
amount, about US$70 million is committed for construction of the Tan-Zam
highway. While the construction of primary and secondary roads will absorb
the bulk of remaining funds, increased emphasis is being given to the
development of feeder roads. The adequacy of this program and of the funds
allocated to it, not only in terms of construction needs but also in relation
to the road maintenance implications, cannot be properly assessed until fur-
ther review of road priorities has been undertaken (para. 3.10) and until a
full-scale study of maintenance requirements has been completed (para. 3.13).
3.10      Highway planning is carried out by the Planning Division of
COMWORKS, working closely with the RAD. The Government has asked this
division, which is staffed largely by personnel provided by CIDA, to review
road investment proposals in order to assure that those with the highest
priority are selected for study under the project (para. 4.07).
E.  Engineering and Construction
3.11t     The RAD is responsible for the design and construction of road
projects. The Division relies on consultants for the engineering and
supervision of major works. COMWORKS' Materials and Research Division
gives valuable support to the RAD and to consultants. Only a few small



- 8 -
local construction firms are active in Tanzania. COMWORKS uses its own
forces for all minor construction works, while major construction works
are let to foreign contractors, including those regionally-based, after
competitive bidding.
F. Highway Maintenance
3.12      Maintenance of the highway network is carried out by COMWORKS'
regional offices under the responsibility of the RAD. Until recently,
maintenance of the 17,000 km of feeder roads was the responsibility of the
District Councils, but the local authorities were unable to keep them
adequately maintained and the roads are being added gradually to the RAD
workload.
3.13      The Government recognizes that maintenance of the feeder road
network represents a considerable increase in the responsibilities of the
RAD, and an overall study of the maintenance needs is currently underway
with USAID financing. The study, being carried out by Lyon Associates Inc.
(US), is expected to be completed early in 1972. The terms of reference
for the study, on which the Association was consulted, call for recommend-
atio)ns on maintenance organization, operations, financing and equipment,
and on a program of road rehabilitation. The Government plans to discuss
the conclusions and recommendations of the study with the Association with
a view to agreeing upon a maintenance program which would be undertaken,
if possible, with financial assistance from the Bank Group. The feeder
roacl betterment program to be carried out under the project is expected
to provide valuable experience which can be incorporated into this main-
tenance program.
4. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01      The project consists of the following:
(a) improvement to bituminous paved standard of the existing
two-lane road between Mtwar4 and Masasi (200 km);
(b) betterment of 475 km of agricultural feeder roads in the
Geita district and in the Mara region;
(c) preinvestment studies for
(i) preparation of the present project, and
(ii) improvement of 250 km of high priority roads;



(d) supervision by consultants of works under (a) and (b)
above, including technical assistance for training under
(b); and
(e) continuation of the staffing and training program.
B.  Improvement of the Mtwara-Masasi Road (200 km)
4.02      The Mtwara-Mingoyo-Nanganga road, which links an important agricul-
tural area with the port of Mtwara, is the most heavily-travelled section of
the main primary road serving the southern part of the country. Between 1959
and 1962, the section from Mtwara to Mingoyo (82 km) was improved to engi-
neered gravel standard, and the first 14 km from Mtwara were given a bitumi-
nous surface dressing. The Mingoyo-Masasi section (118 km) was improved to
engineered gravel standard between 1964 and 1968 under the Bank Group's first
highway project.
4.03      Paving the Mtwara-Masasi road at this time is the next logical
stage in the progressive development of the road to meet growing traffic
requirements. Under the project, the unpaved portion of the road will be
given a cement stabilized base, with a double bituminous surface course.
The geometric standards of the existing road are generally adequate and,
for the most part, will be retained. Some minor improvement will be made
to the alignment of the Mtwara-Mingoyo section and one temporary structure
will be replaced by a permanent bridge. The design standards (Table 4) are
adequate for this type of road and traffic. A weigh bridge will be installed
at a suitable location to prevent overloading of vehicles.
C.  Betterment of Agricultural Feeder Roads (475 km)
4.04      Success of the Government's agricultural development program is
dependent on the good condition of feeder roads. In many important agricul-
tural areas throughout the country, however, the condition of the roads is
woefully inadequate, generally because they have not been properly maintained.
Movement of crops and perishable goods is often hindered because of the
lack of adequate roads between points of production, processing and market.
4.05      As a first step to enable the Government to bring these roads to
adequate standard and to maintain them properly, the project includes a
pilot program for feeder road betterment. Under the program, units for bet-
terment and maintenance will be established in two important agricultural
areas, the Geita cotton district and the Mara dairy region, where the success
of specific agricultural development programs being undertaken by the Govern-
ment is dependent on the adequacy of selected feeder roads (Table 5). The
two betterment units will be equipped under the project (Table 6) and will
be operated by RAD forces trained and supervised by experts to be provided
(see para. 4.20). The minor works to be carried out - i.e., construction of
culverts, digging of drainage ditches, and regravelling - will assure the
efficient evacuation of cotton production in Geita and will provide all-
weather connections between dairy farms and milk processing plants in Mara.
Once the condition of the selected roads has been improved, the equipment will
be utilized for betterment works elsewhere and general road maintenance.

D. Preinvestment Studies by Consultants
4.06      The Government has requested IDA financing for the studies which
were carried out by consultants, with the concurrence of the Association,
to complete project preparation (see paras. 1.01 and 1.03). Specifically,
they are: detailed engineering of the Mtwara-Masasi road, feasibility
study of possible improvements to the Masasi-Songea road, and preliminary
engineering for feeder roads in the Mara and Mbulu regions. These studies
will be financed retroactively under the project (para. 4.13).
4.07      Improvement of the country's primary and secondary road network
is being given considerable support by the Bank Group. In order to prepare
the next group of roads for future lending operations, consultant services
for the feasibility study and detailed engineering of about 250 km of the
highest priority roads is included in the project. The roads will be
selected on the basis of pre-feasibility studies presently being carried out
by COMWORKS' Planning Division. Durlng negotiations, the Government agreed
to furnish to the Association, not later than October 31, 1971, the results
of this comprehensive review of road investment priorities and to select, in
agreement with the Association, the specific roads to be studied and engi-
neered under the project.
E. Construction Supervision and Training by Consultants
4.03      Consultants will be provided under the project to supervise
construction of the Mtwara-Masasi road. Consultants will also direct
and supervise the activities of the two betterment and maintenance units
to be established, training Tanzanian personnel in the planning of better-
ment; and maintenance works, and in equipment operation and proper mainte-
nance techniques (para. 4.20).
F. Staffing and Training Program
4.09      The staffing and training program included in the first highway
project was designed to assure the efficient operation of the road organi-
zation while helping to train Tanzanian nationals to take over management
responsibilities. An amount of US$250,000 was provided under Credit 115-
TA t.o finance that portion of salaries which exceeded the Tanzanian salary
scale for as many as eight foreign experts. In fact, the salaries of only
two experts had to be supplemented by credit funds because the Government
was able to recruit experts for some of the positions at Tanzanian rates
and to fill the other positions through bilateral assistance. Credit 115-
TA terminates (December 31, 1971) before the contracts of these two experts
expire; the present project provides US$50,000 equivalent to assure con-
tinuation, throughout project execution, of the services of these or other
experts selected in agreement with the Association.

- 12 -
4.11      The cost estimate for improvement of the Mtwara-Masasi road is
based on the consultants' detailed studies. The foreign exchange component
of construction is estimated at 68% and assumes execution by a foreign con-
tractor; this is consistent with past highway construction projects in
Tanzania.
4.12      Cost estimates for equipment, spare parts, steel culvert pipes
and fuel for the betterment of feeder roads are based on the consultants'
cost estimates for the Mara feeder roads, modified through consultation
between the Government and the Association. Since no taxes or import duties
are levied on equipment and spare parts for COMWORKS, the foreign exchange
component of these items is 100% of Dar es Salaam CIF costs. The combined
foreign exchange cost of culvert pipes and fuel is estimated at 80% of their
total cost on site.
4.13      The cost of engineering studies for the Mtwara-Masasi and Masasi-
Songea roads, and for the Mara and Mbulu feeder roads reflect the contract
amounts that were agreed between the Government and the consultants, SWECO
and Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners in September and October 1970. The for-
eign cost of these studies, amounting to about US$163,000, is expected to be
disbursed by the Government before the Credit Agreement for the project is
signied.
4.14      The cost estimate of feasibility studies and detailed engineering
is based on the assumption that about 250 km of road will be selected for
studly and is based on a rough estimate of per-kilometer costs. The estimated
cost: of supervision of improvement works on the Mtwara-Masasi road is based
on the cost of supervision of similar construction work in Tanzania. The
cost. of technical assistance required for the feeder road betterment program
is based on man-month requirements. The foreign exchange costs of continuing
the services of two experts under the staffing and training program for the
duration of the project is that portion of their salaries which exceeds the
Tanzanian salary scale as determined in their contracts, plus the cost of
required international travel.
4.15      The 6% quantity contingency allowance for the Mtwara-Masasi road
improvement covers extra quantities that may be required in the base and sub-
base after results of additional soil tests become available during construc-
tion. A contingency of 20% has been allowed for increased quantities of cul-
vert pipes, fuel and labour, since detailed engineering for feeder roads will
be carried out simultaneously with execution of the works. Unforeseen
delays in construction periods and in duration of engineering studies require
a quantity contingency estimated at 10% for all consultants' services
except those which are based on lump sum contracts. For price variation, an
overall contingency allowance of 10% has been included in the project cost
estimates except for those contracts which have already been negotiated.
This allowance is based on price increases of 5-6% p.a. in both Tanzania
and other countries from which equipment, materials and services are expected
to originate; it is considered adequate to cover variations in bid prices and
posslble increases during the construction period in accordance with price
esca:Lation clauses of the contracts.

H. Financing and Disbursements
4.16      The proposed credit will cover the foreign exchange costs of the
project, estimated at US$6.5 million equivalent. During negotiations, the
Government confirmed that it will meet all local costs of the project, esti-
mated at US$3.0 million equivalent. No difficulty is foreseen with respect
to local cost financing.
4.17      Credit funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 70% of payments made to the contractor for improvement of
the Mtwara-Msaasi road, of the on-site cost of culvert
pipes and fuel, and of consultants' services, which rep-
resents an average of the estimated foreign exchange costs
of these items;
(b) the CIF cost Dar es Salaam of imported equipment and spare
parts; and
(c) that portion of the salaries of experts in the staffing
and training program which exceeds the normal civil service
salary, plus the cost of international travel.
4.18      The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Table 7.  Any
surplus funds remaining in the credit account upon completion of the project
would be applied toward the feasibility study and detailed engineering of
additional roads selected in agreement with the Association.
I. Execution
4.19      The RAD will have overall responsibility for execution of the proj-
ect. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that the contract for im-
provement of the Mtwara-Masasi road will be awarded after international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines and that supervision
will be by consultants satisfactory to the Association.
4.20      The feeder road betterment program will be carried out by COMWORKS
with departmental forces. Consultants will provide a team of experts con-
sisting of a superintendent and two mechanics for each of the two betterment
and maintenance units to be established. One team will direct the operations
of the Geita unit under the responsibility of the Regional Engineer of Mwanza,
and the other will direct the operations of the Mara unit under the responsi-
bility of the Regional Engineer of Musoma. These teams will also provide
technical assistance and training to Tanzanian inspectors, foremen, plant
operators and workshop mechanics. In addition, a supervising team also pro-
vided by the consultants, consisting of a resident engineer in Mwanza and an
assistant resident engineer with each unit, will plan operations, lay out the
work, supervise execution of construction, and monitor and analyze the results
of experience gained under the program. The supervising team, which will re-
port directly to the Chief Engineer of the RAD, will also train Tanzanian
counterpart engineers who are in short supply. During negotiations, the



- 14 -
Government and the Association discussed and agreed upon the detailed pro-
cedures for executing the betterment program, and the Government agreed that,
af.ter consultation with the Association, it will assign three suitably qual-
il:ied Tanzanian engineers as counterparts to the consultants' team.
4.21      This method of execution has been selected as the most suitable
and efficient because it offers the required flexibility for the small and
scattered works involved, and because it will enable COMWORKS to build up
its capacity to plan, execute and maintain rural roads, consistent with
th,e Government policy of self reliance. The Government wishes to retain
the consultants who carried out preliminary engineering for the Mara and
Mbulu feeder roads, Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, for the management
and supervision of field operations under the betterment program. This
arrangement is satisfactory. The consultants will prepare bidding documents
for the purchase of equipment and spare parts as well as those for culvert
pipes, and assist the Government in evaluating bids. During negotiations,
the Government confirmed that equipment and materials will be procured through
international competitive bidding.
4.22      The consultants for the feasibility studies and detailed engineer-
ing of 250 km of primary roads will be selected and employed in accordance
wilth procedures satisfactory to the Association. This was agreed during
negotiations.
4.23      Construction of the Mtwara-Masasi road is scheduled to begin in
April 1972 and to be completed by the end of 1973. Equipment for the
betterment and maintenance units should arrive in the first half of 1972,
ancl the works, beginning shortly thereafter, are expected to be completed
by the end of 1973 in Mara, and by mid-1974 in Geita.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      The project is multi-purpose in scope, ranging from the paving of
a primary road to small-scale betterment works on feeder roads in rural
areas. Though different in their construction standards, the proposed
works are geared to the common objective of stimulating agricultural develop-
ment through either direct or indirect association with specific agricultural
activities. The Geita feeder roads, for example, provide an outlet for the
important cotton crop. The Mara roads are essential to an important milk-
pro,ducing scheme. While the Mtwara-Masasi road forms a part of the regional
highway linking the port of Mtwara and the entire southern fringe of the coun-
try inland to Mbeya and the Tan-Zam highway, most of its present traffic is
local and concerned with the movement of the substantial cashew nut crop grown
in the area.
A. Improvement of the Mtwara-Masasi Road (200 km)
5.02      The main crop of the area served by the Mtwara-Masasi road,
cashew nuts, is transported to market between November and February which



- 15 -
happens to coincide with the rainy season. Traffic on the road, about
half of which is truck traffic, mainly 7-ton vehicles, is therefore heaviest
when the road's bearing capacity, due to saturation, is low. Substantial
deterioration of the carriageway results, causing excessive maintenance
costs and sharply increased vehicle operating costs. Traffic has reached
a level where paving is justified on the basis of savings in both vehicle
operating costs and road maintenance costs. The latter are of greater
than usual significance because of the poor quality of local gravel and
the relatively large proportion of heavy truck and bus traffic (53%-73%
of total traffic according to segment).
5.03      For analysis, the road has been divided into four sections:
Mtwara-Mingoyo (82 km), Mingoyo-Mtama (36 km), Mtama-Nanganga (24 km), and
Nanganga-Masasi (58 km). Traffic forecasts on the four sections are based
on counts taken by United Research Inc. supplemented by recent counts by
SWECO. Actual 1970 traffic volumes on the four sections were as follows:
Mtwara-Mingoyo - 165 vpd; Mingoyo-Mtama - 150 vpd; Mtama-Nanganga - 120 vpd;
Nanganga-Masasi - 85 vpd.
5.04      Savings in vehicle operating costs have been estimated by comparing
operating costs on the existing road during both the wet and dry seasons with
those on the proposed paved surface. Seasonal savings by type of vehicle
have been forecast for each road segment and applied to expected traffic
volumes so as to produce annual savings for the anticipated life of the road.
Maintenance cost savings have been calculated in an acceptable manner by
the consultants and have been added to the vehlcle operating savings to
give total expected quantifiable benefits for present traffic forecasts which
yield economic returns on the individual road sections of 16%, 15%, 13% and
9% respectively. The overall economic return on the proposed investment is
14%. Using a 10% discount rate, the benefit/cost ratio is about 1.27:1.
5.05      These calculations are based on the traffic growth rates estimated
for 20 years by United Research Inc.; namely, 3% p.a. for trucks and 5% p.a.
for buses and private cars. Since current traffic levels, when compared
with those forecast by United Research Inc. three years ago, reveal a con-
siderably higher rate of growth than is assumed, the estimates of economic
return can be considered to be minimal; if traffic were to continue growing
at the rate actually experienced over the last three years, the economic
return on the proposed paving would approximate 17%.
5.06      Although the return calculated for the Nanganga-Masasi section is
modest in comparison with those of the other sections, the Government and
the Association have agreed on its inclusion in the project since Masasi is
a market and administrative center for the area and a natural terminal point
for the road. Also, the area around Nanganga-Masasi has good potential for
increased output of cashew nuts, livestock, cereals and other commodities,
so that some benefits in addition to those used in the analysis are likely
to materialize. The southern part of Tanzania in the vicinity of the project
road is one of the least developed areas in the country and paving the whole
road should have a positive impact on the economic and social development of
the area.



16 -
B. Betterment and Maintenance of the Geita Cotton Roads
5.07      The economy of the Geita district is primarily based on cotton
production that accounts for some 20% of Tanzania's total annual output.
With the lower transport costs that would result from road improvement, an
increase in production could be induced, provided other important inputs -
primarily cotton-seed, insecticides, and fertilizers - are made available
in the areas concerned. A cotton development project for the Geita district,
which is in the Government's second Five-Year Development Plan, is in an
advanced stage of preparation with assistance from the PMEA.
5.08      The poor condition of the existing track and road links inhibits
trucking movements on the critical connections between the cotton buying
posts and the ginneries, where the seed-cotton is processed. Heavy sea-
sonal rains, coming at the end of the cotton-picking period, frequently
mrake roads impassable. This discourages cotton production since it delays
the movement of cotton to the ginneries and reduces its market value because
cc,tton remaining unginned is subject to discoloration. The betterment of
specific roads and tracks under the proposed project will assure more reli-
able transport. The benefits, which consist of savings in vehicle operating
cost for existing traffic and induced cotton production, accrue chiefly be-
cause of improvements to the specific roads in question. Some benefits will
also be derived from the overall improvement in maintenance services on main
roads, feeder roads and tracks throughout the district for at least the life
of the equipment to be made available.
5.09      Since many of the selected roads are being improved specifically
for seed-cotton collection and the distribution of seed, fertilizers and
insecticides, this progran cannot be divorced from the overall cotton
promotion scheme involving the distribution of essential inputs. Net
benefits for the project have been computed after allowance for total
additional costs of producing the induced cotton as well as for the road
bel-terment and maintenance. These benefits are expected to yield an
overall economic return of about 21%; the benefit/cost ratio is about
1.62:1 at 10%. The return on the investment is subject to a number of
uncertain variables relating principally to the extent to which the volume
anuc value of cotton production will be favorably affected by the road im-
prcvenment program. TUnder the assumption that induced cotton production
could be as much as 25% lower than anticipated - the maximum shortfall to
le expected - the overall economic return on the project remains about 14%,
:tndicating that the project would still be economically sound.
C7 Betterment and Maintenance of the Mara Region Dairy Roads
5e li     This portion of the project relates specifically to a Government-
sponsored dairy development scheme which is supported by Danish technical
and financial assistance. rne roads in question are essential to the
collection of milk for two milk processing plants now under construction,
and virtually all traffic on the roads will relate to the dairy scheme.
It ls therefore impossible to separate the benefits accruing to the road and
mill processing elements. Justification for both the road betterment pro-



- 17 -
gram and the dairy scheme is based on the net benefits to be obtained from
induced milk production, after allowance for all costs of milk collection
and processing and of road betterment and maintenance. As in the case
of the Geita roads, however, additional benefits will accrue to the entire
Mara region road system since the project will strengthen the RAD's capacity
to provide normal maintenance services.
5.11      The combined dairy scheme and road betterment program is expected
to yield an economic return of 28% or a benefit/cost ratio, assuming a 10%
discount rate, of 1.7:1. Initial results from the implementation of the
dairy scheme indicate that the targets for production can, indeed, be
achieved, and that the indicated economic return is therefore realistic.
If it is found possible, as a result of improved transport facilities, to
place increased emphasis on whole milk production rather than the lower-priced
ghee, butter and powdered milk products included in this scheme, an even
greater return might be attained.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      The major Project matter discussed during negotiations was the in-
clusion of the Nanganga-Masasi (58 km) road section in the project. At
first, the Association had reservations about this section because of the
modest economic return which could be expected in terms of quantifiable bene-
fits from its paving. In the light of the arguments brought forward during
negotiations, however, the Association and the Government agreed to include
this road section in the project (para. 5.06). Other important project mat-
