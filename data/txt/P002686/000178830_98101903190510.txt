REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TC THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPM'ENT CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the United Republic of Tanzania for the equivalent of US$6.5
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Third Highway Project.
PART I - THE ECONOINY
2.        Since attaining independence in 1961 Tanzania, under the out-
standing leadership of President Nyerere, has had an enviable record of
political stability. The absence of tribal and racial strife has enabled
the country to devote much time and thought to the formulation of medium-
and long-term development objectives and also to apply a considerable pro-
portion of its meagre resources to development.
3.        Soon after its independence Tanzania declared its intention to
establish a socialist society. In the furtherance of this objective, the
country has steadily enlarged the scope of the public sector and shown
determination to secure a commanding role for the Government in the economy.
The ever-wqidening role of the Government has inevitably eroded the role of
private enterprise in many activities. The Government is aware of the
dislocation of economic life resulting from some of its policies but does
not consider the price too high when viewed against the background of its
socio-economic objectives. Considerable emphasis has been placed on
austerity and self-help, and there has been a conspicuous absence of
projects which are mainly prestigious. A serious effort has also been
made to bring about a more equitable distribution of incomes. Wages of
low income workers have steadily risen - although a recent policy has
linked this to productivity increases - while politicians, ministers,
high-placed civil servants and employees of public corporations have had
to accept cuts in emoluments.
4.        For many years the Government has been particularly concerned
to improve the living standard of the rural population. This has not been
easy, since Tanzania is a large country and the majority of the people live
on scattered holdings on the periphery. The absence of population concen-
trations makes it difficult to provide social or economic services, such
as health services, education, extension services, water supplies and
feeder roads. To help remedy this situation, the Government launched a
program of village settlements during its First Five-Year Plan (1964-69),
aimed at bringing about a regrouping of the rural population. This program
proved expensive and was abandoned at an early stage of the Plan.



5.        During the present Plan (1969-74), the Government has formulated
an ambitious, but very different, program to encourage the rural population
to live together in newly formed villages. These villages, known as Ujamaa
villages, are to be established on a voluntary basis and operated by the
villager themselves. UJjamaa villages are based on the extended family
principles which have for long governed traditional African life and require
that members of the group perform tasks such as constructing dwellings,
clearing and cultivating land and harvesting within a cooperative frame-
work and share the goods held in common. Apart from extending socialist
ideas and organization to the countryside, Ujamaa villages provide the most
economical and, perhaps, the only means of bringing a variety of essential
services to the rural population.
6.        The fcrmation of Ujamaa villages proceeded slowly at first but
has lately been gathering momentum. The initial suspicion of people is
giving way to greater acceptance and during the first two years of the
Plan some 2,500 villages were established. The response to the Ujamaa
movement has not been uniform throughout the country; progress has been
particularly slow in areas where peasant farmers are already engaged in
the production of well-established cash crops and hence often do not feel
the necessity to change to a new and untried way of life. WThile the
Government is anxious to speed up the formation of Ujamaa villages, it
recognizes that the movement will gain ground and be successful only if
the principle of voluntary association is preserved. The process of
bringing the bulk of Tanzania's rural population into Ujamaa villages will
take a long time.  In the meantime, it is necessary to monltor the program
carefully and assess its costs and benefits.
7.        In its external relations Tanzania has pursued a 'non-aligned'
policy and has good relations with both western countries and communist
countries in Europe and Asia. The major proportion of external assistance
to Tanzania has been and continues to be provided by western countries.
At the same time, small amounts of aid have been obtained from Russia and
other countries in eastern Europe. In addition, a large project to estab-
lish a rail link between Landlocked Zambia and the Tanzanian port of Dar
es Salaam is being financed by the People's Republic of China, which has
also provided finance for other projects in Tanzania.
8.        Following the military coup in Uganda in January 1971, which
resulted in the replacement of President Obote by General Amin, and the
subsequent refusal by Tanzania to recognize the new Ugandan Government,
some strains have developed in the East African Community. Since that
time, the East African Authority (the highest executive organ of the
Community comprising the Heads of State of the three member countries) has
not met and the various Ministerial CouLicils of the Community have also
not been convened. Pending a resolution of the political impasse, the
three countries have shown a willingness to seek a modus vivendi for en-
suring continuity in the day-to-day operations of the Community Secretariat
and the common services. Routine operations requiring the cooperation of



- 3 -
the three countries have been conducted through informal contact. In this
way, a major disruption of the Community's activities has so far been
avoided. In addition, despite the differences between the Heads of State,
the East African Legislative Assembly met in May 1971 and approved the
1971/72 budgets of the Community Secretariat and other institutions. None-
theless, as recent reports have underlined, the political difficulties
between Tanzania and Uganda have not yet been resolved and continue to
interrupt the Community's progress.
9.        An economic mission from the Bank visited Tanzania during August
and September 1969 and its report "The Economic Development and Prospects
of Tanzania" (No. AE-7 in two volumes) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in March 1970. The mission reviewed Tanzania's Second Five-Year
Plan which was launched in July 1969 and concluded that the targets of the
Plan were generally realistic and that the programs were worthy of external
support.  It was the mission's assessment that Tanzania's capacity to im-
plement the Plan was now significantly better than during the First Plan
but that a resource constraint might appear if external assistance fell
short of the required amounts.
10.       Tanzania's Second Five-Year Plan envisages an overall investment
of Sh 8,055 million during the fiscal years 1970-74. The Bank's 1969
economic mission concluded that investment during the Plan could amount
to about Sh 7,430 million - some Sh 600 million less than the Plan target -
with most of the shortfall occurring in the private and parastatal sectors.
The mission estimated that the Central Government's development program
(including contributions to parastatal organizations) could amount to about
Sh 3,380 million, of which internal sources - mainly recurrent budget
surpluses and borrowTing - would provide about 55 percent and external
sources the rest.
11.       During the first year of the Plan, the Central Government's
development expenditure amounted to Sh 623 million which, on the average,
is close to the Plan target. In fiscal year 1971, however, development
expenditure rose steeply to Sh 850 million. During these two years ex-
ternal aid amounted to Sh 450 million or only 30 percent of development
expenditure, substantially short of the Plan's expectation that it would
amount to about 45 percent of the total. Hence there has been considerable
pressure on internal resources, resulting in a high level of borrowing from
the Central Bank and a consequent rundown in foreign assets. In order to
prevent an aggravation of the situation, the Government has decided to
limit development expenditure in fiscal year 1972 to about the level
attained in 1971.
12.       An economic and preinvestment studies mission visited Tanzania,
Kenya and Uganda during October and November 1970, with the principal
objective of preparing a program of preinvestment studies to provide a
firm basis for the investment programs. Volume I of the mission's report
(No. AE-16) which deals with recent economic developments within the East



African Community, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda was distributed to the
Executive Directors on July 14, 1971; basic data on the economy are given
in Annex II. The report confirms that Tanzania has experienced difficulty
in raising resources on an adequate scale to finance its investment program
and that increased external assistance is required if the rising tread of
development expenditure is to be maintained.   The draft volumes of the
report dealing with preinvestment studies have recently been discussed with
the governments and it is expected that these volumes will be distributed
to the Executive Directors by mid-August.
13.       At the end of 1969, Tanzania's outstanding external public debt,
including undisbursed amounts, was $347.0 million equivalent (including
$72.1 million representing a notional one-third share on account of the
East African Community Corporations). Interest and amortization payments
on account of Tanzania's own debt amounted to $14.7 million equivalent in
1969 while the notional share of payments on account of the Coiporations
was a further $5.4 million.  Together these payments absorbed 7.4 percent
of the foreign exchange earnings during the year. Although Tanzania has
succeeded in raising considerable amounts locally to finance development,
its low per capita income and the relatively limited prospects for its
predominantly agricultural exports justify lending on concessional terms.
PART II - BA1NK GRLOUP --IT,h TO TYiNZJATIA
14.       Tanzania joined the Bank Group in 1962. Beginning with an IDA
credit for education in 1963, Tanzania has to date received a total of
nine credits and three Bank loans amounting to $102.9 million. In addition,
Tanzania has been a beneficiary of six loans totalling $162.8 million which
have been extended for the cevelopment of common services operated on a
regional basis for the three member countries of the East African Community
(EAC), Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Sur,mary statements of the Bank and
IDA's assistance to Tanzania and the East African common services are in
Annex I.
15.       Taking account of the lending for the East African common serv-
ices, about half of the Bank Group's assistance to Tanzania has so far
been for the improvement of transportation, including railways, highways
and harbors. The remainder of the Group's support has been directed
towards the development of agriculture, education, power and telecormuni-
cations. A large part of the lending to Tanzania, both directly and through
the corporations of EAC, has occurred in the past three years.
16.       Reflecting the central place of agriculture in the Tanzanian
economy and the heavy emphasis placed by the Government on the development
of the rural sector, it is expected that our assistance to Tanzania in the
coming years will to an increasing extent be aimed at raising agricultural
production. A smallholder tea development project is now in an advanced
stage of appraisal, and a cotton project and a second livestock project
for which Bank Group assistance will probably be requested are under



- 5 -
preparation by the Government irith assistance from our Permanent lNission
in Eastern Africa (PMEA).  Apart from such directly productive projects,
we expect that, as in the case of the proposed Third Highway Project, our
operations in other sectors will also be largely geared to serving the
rural community.
17.       Although delays have occurred from time to time in the execution
of Bank and IDA projects in Tanzania, performance has for the most part
been satisfactory and there are no serious current problems. Reconstruc-
tion of the 880 kIn of primary roads included in the First Highway Project
(Credits Nos 48 TA and 115 TA) was completed in 1970, and work on the
Second Highway Project (Credit No. 142 TA and Loan No. 586 TA), wJhich
consists of the reconstruction of a 510 km section of the Tan-Zam Highway,
is progressing satisfactorily. With the Association's agreement, the
rights and obligations of the National Development Credit Agency (NDCA)
under the Agricultural Credit Project (Credit No. 80 TA) and the Flue-
Cured Tobacco Project (Credit No. 217 TA) were transierred to the newi
Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB) with effect from May 1, 1971.
18.       IFC's only investments in Tanzania to date, totalling $4.4
million, were made in Kilombero Sugar Company in 1960 and 1964. This
company encountered financial difficulties and in 1969 IFC and other
investors sold their interest in the company to the Government. Dis-
cussions have recently been taking place regarding the possibility of IFC
investing in a tourism venture in Tanzania.
PART III - THE PROJECT
The Transport Sector
19.      'rhe transport sector in Tanzania presently consists of about
34,000 km of roads, of w7hich the bulk are low standard gravel or earth
roads; 2,500 km oi railway operated by the East African Railways Cor-
poration (EARC); three ocean ports operated by the East African Harbours
Corporation (EAHC), of which the port at Dar es Salaam is the most imn-
portant; coastal shipping; and regularly scheduled air services. The
development of the sector is dictated by the need to serve the productive
activities and population widely distributed around the country, to facil-
itate the movement of Tanzanian exports and imports to and from the porbs
and to accommodate the transport needs of neighboring landlocked coun-
tries - Rwanda, Burundi, the Eastern part of Congo (Kinshasa), and to an
increasing extent Zambia.
20.       For several decades, transport policy was directed almost ex-
clusively toward the requirements of external trade and emphasis was
placed on the development of the East African Railways, which now forms



- 6 -
the backbone of the transport sector and carries the bulk of heavy, 'Long
distance traffic. With assistance from the Bank, substantial expenditure
has been incurred in recent years in modernizing and expanding the East
African Railways in accordance with the growth of traffic, and this program
of development is continuing.
21.       In the past the East African Railways were protected from road
competition by restrictive licensing of truck operators.   Under the ar-
rangements for Loan No. 428 EA of September, 1965 for the former East
African Railways and Harbours Administration, the C-overnments of Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda agreed to carry out a study to assist them in formu-
lating sound regulatory, investment and pricing policies for all surface
modes of transport in the three countries. This study, financed by UNDP
with the Bank as executing agency, concluded that competition between road
and rail of'fered the more economic solution to coordination between the
two modes of transport. It recommended that iARC's rate and tariff struc-
ture be revised to prevent any uneconomic transfer of traffic from rail to
road transport and that restrictive road licensing practices then be
abolished. Under the terms of Bank Loan No. 674 EA to EARG signed in INay
1970, the three Govrernments have agreed to implement the study's main
findings and this is in progress.
22.       The railway system in Tanzania is now undergoing a further major
extension through the construction, wTith finance from the People's Republic
of China, of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway which, though basical'y designed
to carry Zambian transit traffic, should help to stimulate agricultural
and industrial development in the southern part of Tanzania. A 500 km
section of this railway, between Dar es Salaam and Nlimba, is scheduled
to come into service by the end of 1971. Plans are in hand to provide the
new facilities at the port of Dar es Salaam which will be required to
handle the additional traffic generated by the new railway when it becomes
fully operational, which is currently expected to occur in early 1975.
The Bank has been approached by EAIC for another lean to help finance the
proposed port development.
23.       In addition to the extension and modernization of the railway
system, a substantial program was initiated during Tanzania's First Five-
Year Plan to improve primary and secondary roads in order to foster regional
development. During the Second Five-Year Plan, particularly the first
three years of it, the highway program will continue to be dominated by
trunk route development, particularly by the reconstruction of the Tan-
Zam Highway. Nonetheless, it is hoped during the Second Plan period to
achieve a better balance betwreen the development of trunk routes and other
types of roads and a careful review is currently being made by the Govern-
ment of the priority of all proposed expenditures on highways with this
in view. In accordance with the importance attached by the Government to
developing the rural sector, increased emphasis is being given to roads
which will assist agricultural expansion.



-7-
24.       Highway planning is carried out by the Planning Divrision of the
jilnistry of Communications, Transport and Labour (C0C1;'5RXS) in close con-
tact wnith the Roads and Aerodromes Division (RAD) of CWiWMORKS. The RAD is
responsible for design, construction and maintenance of primrary anc
secondary roads and has recently begun to take cover responsibility for
feeder roads frcm the District Councils.  During the past few years a lack
of competent and experienced engineers has adversely affected COW1FORIKS'
performance, especially in road maintenance and planning. However, a
number of additional staff have now been recruited, partly under the Staffing
and Training Program initiated under the First IDA Highway Project, and
bilateral technical assistance from Canada has further eased the staffing
situation. Road maintenance is a continuing problem but it is hoped that
major steps to deal with this will be initiated following a study of road
maintenance requirements in Tanzania which is currently being carried out
with financial assistance from the United States. The Bank has indicated
its willingness to consider providing finance for a road maintenance project
based on the outcome of this study.
25.       In accordance with Tanzania's development philosophy, the role of
the Government in the provision of road transport services has been extended
over the past few years. A Government-onmed National Transport Company
has been created to control Zambia-Tanzania Road Services, which provides
the bulk of road transport services for Zambian exports and imports via
Dar es Salaam, and the Dar es Silaam lvHotor Transport Company, wihich provides
urban bus services. The Gcvernment has tentatively proposed to expand tha
activities of this organization into the field of inter-regional road
transport by taking over existing long distance operations now largely
owned and operated by private interests, but no finm policy has yet evolved.
Financing has been requested from UIDP for a study of the implications of
the proposed nationalization policy and the most suitable course of action
with respect to the developnent of the National Transport Company.
26.       The Bank Group's assistance to the highway sector in Tanzania has
so far been concentrated upon the development of primary and secondary
roads. As already indicated, the First Highway Project consisted prin-
cipally of the reconstruction of six sections of main roads in various
parts of the country.  The Second Highway Project, which is being financed
jointly wiUl SwTeden, provides for the reconstruction of a section of the
Tan-Zam Highway; the reconstruction of other parts of this road is being
financed by the United States.  Because of the continued low standard of
much of Tanzania's main highway system and the growth of traffic, further
improvements to certain major road links are necessary. At the same time,
increasing attention is being given by the Bank and other agencies to the
need to improve minor roads serving agricultural districts in order to
support the Government's endeavors to promote rural development.

The ProJect
27.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Third Highway Project in
Tanzania" is being circulated separately.  A Credit and Project Summary
is provided in Annex III.
28.       The project, which was partly prepared through studies financed
under the First Highway Project, was appraised in the field in December
1970. Negotiations were held in lWashington in HIay 1971. The Tanzanian
Government was represented by Messrs. I.M. Kiaduma, Principal Secretary,
COTIJORKS; R. Korosso, Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Finance;
H. Singh, Engineer-in-Chief, Department of Wlorks and. Supplies, CCNJORKS;
R.M. i'Iinja, Engineer, C024CRKTS; and E.F. Kapinga, Attorney General's
Chambers.
29.       The project comprises:
(a) the paving of a 200 km section of the main Southern Trunk
Road between 1Utwara and Masasi, part of wJhich was improved
to gravel standard under the First Highway Project;
(b) betterment of 475 km of agricultural feeder roads in the
Geita district and Iviara region in Northern Tanzania through
the creation of departmental units and the provision of
staff and equipment for them;
(c) technical assistance to direct and supervise the above
works, train local staff required for the betterment units
to be established under (b), and continue the staffing and
training program in COMOCRKS initiated under the First
Hiighway Project; and
(d) engineering and other studies for the preparation of the
present project and a further 250 km of roads wihich seem
likely candidates for inclusion in future highway projects
in Tanzania.
30.       The works included in the project, though varying considerably
in their character, are all geared to the general objective of stimulating
agricultural development. The Ntwara-Masasi road forms a part of the
regional highway linking the port of Mtwara and the entire southern fringe
of the country inland to the Tan-Zam Highway near Mbeya. Most of the
present traffic is agricultural and is principally concerned writh the
movement of the substantial cashew nut crop grown in the area. The feeder
roads in the Geita district provide an outlet for the district's important
cotton crop, while the Mara region roads are essential to a milk-producing
scheme established recently with Danish technical and financial assistance,



31.       The main economic benefits from the project will be savings in
road maintenance and vehicle operating costs, increased local capacity to
provide betterment and maintenance services for rural roads, and agri-
cultural development induced by the roads. The estimated economic rates
of return on the major elements of the project range from 14 percent to
28 percent. The project is not expected to give rise to any serious
ecological problems.
32.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$9.5 million
equivalent. The proposed credit of US$6.5 million will cover the esti-
mated foreign exchange component representing about 68 percent of this
total. About US$163,000 of the credit would be provided for retroactive
financing of studies undertaken in connection with the preparation of the
project. The local currency component of the project cost amounting to
US$3.0 mil:Lion woulc be financed by the Government.
33.       The RhD, assisted by qualified consultants, would be responsible
for the execution of the project. The RAD is also responsible for exec-
uting the First and Second Highwifay Projects and hence is fam.liar with the
Association's procedures.
34.       The contract for improvement of the Htwara-Masasi road would be
awarded in accordance with the Association's guidelines for international
competitive bidding. The execution of these wiorks would be supervised by
consultants.
35.       The betterment w-forks for the feeder roads in the Geita district
and Mara region, whlich are small-scale and scattered and would be of little
or no interest to contractors, would be carried out by units to be estab-
lished in the two areas using departmental forces.  Procurement of equip-
ment and materials required by these two units would comply with the
Association's guidelines for international competitive bidding.   Gon-
sultants wQould be engaged to direct and supervise the activities of the
betterment units and would train local staff to take over the operation
of the units in due course. Once the condition of the selected roads had
been improved, the equipment would be utilized for betterment works else-
where and general road maintenance. The project would thus enable Tanzania
to build up a permanent capacity to plan, execute and maintain rural roads.
The lessons learnt from these pilot betterment units would assist the
Government in setting up the countrywide maintenance/betterment program
which is now under preparation.
36.       In addition, in order to prepare the next group of roads for
consideration for Bank Group financing, consultants would be engaged
under the project to undertake feasibility studies and detailed engineerirg
of about 250 km of high-priority roads. These roads would be selected
on the basis of a general review of priorities in the highway sector
presently being carried out by the Planning Division of CCI;1,ORKS and due
to be completed by the end of October 1971.
