METROPOLITAN MANILA WATER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower         Republic of the Philippines
Beneficiary:     Metropolitan Vaterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS)
Amount:          US$69 million equivalent
Terms:           Repayable in 20 years including 5 years of grace, at the
standard variable rate.
Relendins
Terms:         Government would relend the entire loan proceeds to MWSS on
the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan under a
subsidiary Loan Agreement acceptable to the Bank. MWSS would
carry the foreign exchange risk.
Project
Objectives:    The proposed project would assist MWSS to optimize utiliza-
tion of existing infrastructure and thus make significant
improvements in its level of internal cash generation and
financial performance. It would also assist MUSS to improve
its operational efficiency. Specifically, this would be
achieved under the proposed project by improving the water
supply in the MWSS service area through: (a) the completion
of works commenced under the Second Manila Water Supply
Project (Loan 1615-PH), including construction of about 3 km
of bulk water supply mains, 17 km of primary, secondary and
tertiary distribution lines, and installation of about
100,000 service connections; (b) construction of about 8 km
of additional bulk water supply mains; (c) construction of
additional water distribution works providing water to about
72 existing subdivisions, comprising some 16,000 households;
(d) infilling the distribution network in about 24 areas
covering about 13,500 households; (e) provision of yard
connections and standpipes in about 160 low-income areas to
serve about 70,000 households; (f) acquisition of about
100,000 water meters; (g) improvement to the distribution
system through the installation of control valves; (h) devel-
opment of about five deep wells; (i) future project prepara-
tion including seismic monitoring of a future dam site; and
(j) institutional support including consulting services,
training, and provision of motor vehicles and computing
facilities. The proposed project would provide water to many
unserved low-income areas and thus directly benefit the urban
poor.

Risks:           There are no unusual risks associated with this project.  The
major challenges to MWSS are to meet the water meter connec-
tion and water loss reduction targets. The management and
coordination of these activities, which must be regarded as
the two =st difficult tasks in water supply management, will
preoccuspy the implementing agency. However, through a recent
reorganization including the strengthening of the upper
levels of management, decentralization of operations, and the
continuation of a staff training program, appropriate steps
have been taken to minimize risks.

METROPOLITAN MANILA WATER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
Sector Background
1.01      The Philippines is well endowed with natural fresh water resources.
Its average annual rainfall is in the order of 3,000 m. It has more than
100 major rivers, about 60 natural lakes, and significant groundwater
resources. However, as the population grew, the most easily accessible and
cheapest water resources were generally exploited. Many are now inadequate to
support the present population and some have now become polluted. Future
development to serve the large urban areas requires exploitation of distant
and hence more expensive catchment areas, and more costly groundwater
resources in rural areas. Health statistics show that water-borne and
sanitation related diseases such as typhoid, gastro-enteritis, intestinal
parasites and dysentery are prevalent nationwide. Schistosomiasis is wide-
spread in several regions. Reducing the incidence of these diseases,
improving living conditions of the population generally, and economic develop-
ment all require substantial improvement in water supply and sanitation.
1.02      Much has already been done, mainly during the last decade, to
improve water supply and more recently a start was made on improving sanitary
conditions. Following a major sector review in 1972, sector development
institutions were established, sector objectives and strategies were defined
and master plans prepared. Physical development started with water supply and
sanitation projects in several provincial cities and towns and later in
Metropolitan Manila and in the rural areas. It is estimated that potable
water supply was made available to an additional three million people between
1972 and 1980, bringing the total number of people with piped water supply to
around 22 million, i.e. to about 45% of the total population. Despite this
achievement, the proportion of the population unserved has remained at about
55Z because of continued population growth.
1.03      According to the 1980 census estimate, only about 56% of the total
population had access to water-borne sewerage, combined sewerage/drainage
systems, or septic tanks or pits for excreta disposal; the remainder of the
population had no facilities. In the rural areas only about 44Z of the popu-
lation had access to such facilities. In the urban areas the situation is
better with about 76Z of the population having facilities. In Metropolitan
Manila, the 1980 census showed that about 17% of the population was served by
public sewerage or combined sewer/drainage systems, 34% by septic tanks but
the remaining 49% had pit latrines or no service at all. Since 1980 some
improvements have taken place in Metropolitan Manila and recently a start was
made on improving rural sanitation. Only six out of 700 provincial cities or
towns have a public sewerage system.



1.04      The Government has been assisted in its water supply and sanitation
development efforts by several multilateral and bilateral agencies, notably
the Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID). Under the impetus of the United Nations'
International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade, the Government has given
and continues to give a high order of priority to water supply and sanitation
development but resources have been curtailed because of the economic
situation in the Philippines. During 1979-81 about P 3.1 billion or 7.2% of
public investment went to the water suppLy and sanitation sector. In 1982-84
investment increased to P 5.4 billion or 8.6% of total public investment.
Although future investments were expected to total some P 6.7 billion in 1985-
87 and P 7.3 billion in 1988-90, investment plans for 1985 and 1986 have
already been substantially curtailed. The feasibility of investment plans for
subsequent years is being studied under an ongoing Public Investment Review
conducted by Bank staff.
Sector Organization and Financing
1.05      The institutional framework of the sector, and funding and cost
recovery policies are well established in the Philippines. The National Water
Resources Council, which includes representatives oF the various sector insti-
tutions, is responsible for formulating policies for the water supply
sector. The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), established
in 1972, is responsible for development and operation and maintenance of water
supply and sewerage systems in Metropolitan Manila. The Local Water Utilities
Administration (LWUA), established in 1973, is chartered to provide technical
and financial assistance to provincial cities and towns for water supply and
sanitation development. The operation and maintenance of provincial water
supply systems is the responsibility of locally established Water Districts
MODs). The Rural Waterworks Development Corporation (RWDC), established in
1980, is responsible for water supply development in the rural areas. The
lower level systems provided in rural areas are operated and maintained
through local Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Associations (RWSAs). The
Ministry of Public Works and Highways (MPWH) assists RWDC with the drilling of
wells and the Ministry of Health (MOH) implements the rural sanitation
program.
1.06      Development in Metropolitan Manila is funded through self-generated
funds of MWSS, government equity contributions, and foreign loans. LWUA is
funded in the same way and lends these funds to WDs for system development;
the WDs are normally required to make an equity contribution to self-finance
part of the cost of development. The financially weaker WDs may receive some
government grants towards the cost of system development. RWDC also receives
government equity and foreign loans and uses these resources to finance water
supply development in the rural areas. The Government's general policy is to
develop systems on the basis of the communities' financial ability and
willingness to pay for them. Accordingly, individual house connections are
usually provided in the larger metropolitan and provincial urban areas,
standpipe systems in smaller settlements, and wells with hand pumps in the
rural areas. Government policy is that tariffs in Metropolitan Manila are to
be set at levels which should earn MWSS a financial rate of return of 8Z on
its revalued net fixed assets in operation on water supply operations and a



- 3 -
positive rate of return on sewerage operations. For provincial cities and
towns, tariffs are to generate adequate levels of revenue to meet operation
and maintenance costs and cover debt servicing costs or depreciation,
whichever is greater. In rural areas tariffs are expected to meet operation
and maintenance costs and the capital costs of any distribution works; the
Government finances the capital costs of the source works.
Sectoral Issues and Constraints
1.07      MWSS Investment Program.  Until recently, MWSS had an ambitious
long-term investment program aimed at providing adequate water to most of the
population of Metropolitan Manila by 1990, and a sustained expansion of the
sewerage system up to the year 2000. A major component of the water program
was to double the present production capacity of 2,500 Ml/d through the
exploitation of a distant catchment area. This project, referred to as Manila
Water Supply III (MWS III), was scheduled for implementation in 1985-90.
However, the economic downturn starting in 1982-83, the resultant shortage of
local funds, and the high inflation which affected both ongoing and future
investments, reduced internal cash generation of MWSS and limited the
Government's ability to provide equity capital. These developments, and the
successive devaluations of the peso, necessitated a re-examination of MWSS'
investment priorities. A joint review undertaken by MWSS and the Bank in 1984
concluded that in the short- and medium-term, emphasis should be on: (a) the
completion of ongoing bulk water supply mains and distribution works (financed
under the Bank's Second Manila Water Supply Project (MWS II), Loan 1615-PH)
and further expansion of the distribution system to utilize the available
production capacity while at the same time significantly improving the
population coverage and MWSS' revenues; and (b) renewed emphasis on reducing
water losses through expediting the ADB-financed rehabilitation project (para.
3.02 below). A review of the demand forecast indicated that additional
production capacity would not be needed until at least 1995, and thus the
major expenditures for MWS III could be deferred until about 1990.  It was
also concluded that the proposed sewerage investments would have to be
deferred indefinitely in view of financial constraints, and of necessity
prolonging dependence on existing drainage systems for carrying effluents.
This investment review resulted in a reduction in MWSS's medium-term (1985-89)
investment program from over P 15 billion to about P 6 billion.
1.08      The funding of even the reduced MWSS program will not he easy.  Its
previous tax-exempt status has been withdrawn and MWSS is now subject to
duties and import taxes, a franchise tax of 5% on its gross billings, and an
income tax averaging about 33%. Even so, MWSS is expected to finance about
30% of its program from internal cash generation. Achieving this will require
a sustained effort in reducing non-revenue water, increasing sales rapidly
through expanding the number of connections, and regular tariff adjustments.
Slippage in any of these areas would entail a further downward revision in the
investment program (largely meaning further delaying MWS III), since it might
not be realistic for the Government to make contributions to MWSS' equity
beyond its present commitments in 1986 and 1987 (P 350 million and P 300
million respectively).  To facilitate a close monitoring of MWSS' performance,
agreement was reached at negotiations that MWSS will prepare annually,
starting with 1986, an updated investment program and financing plan for the



- 4 -
following five years, furnish them to the Bank by September 30, and review the
program and plan with the Bank semi-annually.
1.09      MWSS Operational Efficiency. HWSS continues to have a high level of
non-revenue water, that is, water which is produced but does not generate
revenues. This results from two factors: (a) physical losses comprising pro-
duction losses, leaks in the distribution system and water used in pressure
testing and flushing newly constructed pipelines, and (b) administrative
losses, that is, water reaching the consumer but not paid for because of
under-registration of meters, incomplete customer records, billing inefficien-
cies and illegal use. Currently, total non-revenue water is estimated at more
than half of production, being shared about equally between physical and
administrative losses. With financial assistance from ADB, MWSS is implemen-
ting a program of rehabilitation works and instituting reforms on administra-
tive procedures to reduce the high volume of non-revenue water from more than
50Z in 1985 to 25Z by 1993. MWSS has geared up to meet this target but it is
a difficult task; its achievement is critical to MWSS' long-term financial
viability.
1.10      LWUA's Future.  At the provincial level LWUA, with financial and
technical support from USAID, has developed into a strong sector institution
and has played a significant role in the physical and institutional develop-
ment of WDs. The establishment of LWUA and the introduction of the Water
District concept, which removes water supply from the responsibility of local
municipal governments, was intended to make water supply an autonomous and
financially viable activity. LWUA's charter provides that all municipalities
with populations in excess of 20,000 would be eligible to form WDs and thus
qualify for financial support through LWUA from the Government. To date only
about 250 of the potential 700 WDs have been formed. As the remaining eli-
gible areas are generally financially weaker, i.e., they have smaller popula-
tions and a weak economic base, it is becoming increasingly difficult to form
financially viable WDs. In existing WDs, actual revenue compared to targets
falls short of expectations, largely because of the longer than expected
leadtime needed for institutional development and achievement of financial
viability. The Bank and LWUA are reviewing LWUA's financial policies and
practices, funding of WD development and related cost recovery, and LWUA's
role in assisting WDs with sanitation improvements as prescribed in its
charter but not yet carried out. The review will provide the means to refor-
mulate LWUA's sector plans and responsibilities.
1.11      RIDC's Role.  Rural water supply and sanitation are currently being
improved through the Bank-assisted Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
(Loan 2206-PH) which includes the construction or rehabilitation of about
10,000 wells and the provision of 750,000 pour-flush toilet units. This pro-
gram is being implemented by: (a) MPWH for well drilling, (b) MOB for the
sanitation component, and (c) RWDC for water supply development in the larger
rural settlements not covered by LWUA. RWDC is also responsible for overall
coordination of rural water supply development. However, RWDC has not yet
made significant progress on rationalizing and coordinating activities in the
rural sector; coordination will be increasingly needed as other aid agencies
become more actively involved in sector development. Similarly, substantial
institutional development at the local level is required before new commit-



ments can be made in rural water supply and sanitation. For this purpose, and
the wider sector issues and constraints described above, the Government and
the Bank have agreed on the updating of the earlier sector study in order to
reappraise sector objectives, development targets and institutional
arrangements. The study has already begun with a review of the operations of
LWUA and RWDC.
Previous Bank Lending, Role and Strategy
1.12      Experience with Previous Bank Lending.  Except for an early loan for
Metropolitan Manila Water Supply (MWS I) in 1964, the Bank's involvement in
the sector essentially started in 1977 with the First Provincial Cities Water
Supply Project (Loan 1415-PH, $23 million) to improve water supp'ly to five
provincial towns outside Manila. Since then, four additional loans have been
made providing for the expansion of water supply and sewerage in Metropolitan
Manila (Loan 1615-PH, $88 million; and Loan 1814-PH, $63 million), water
supply in additional provincial towns (Loan 1710/Credit 920-PH, for a total of
$38 million), and a national program of rural water supply and sanitation
(Loan 2206-PH, $35.5 million). Initial implementation experience with all
projects was generally good, except for start-up delays in the earlier
projects. However, since 1982 implementation of most of the projects has been
adversely affected by the general shortage of Government counterpart funds.
The projects in Metropolitan Manila also suffered particularly from serious
delays and cost over-runs because of the rapid inflation in the last few years
and the failure of several major contractors. Under the Special Action
Program (SAP), the Bank took one or more of the following meAsures to assist
individual projects: increasing the disbursement percentages, establishment
of special accounts, and reduction in the project scope. These measures, com-
bined with actions taken by the implementing agencies to renegotiate and/or
re-award contracts facing difficulties, have helped stabilize the situation.
It is expected that all of the projects will be completed with delays of 2-3
years, and largely achieve their original objectives. The proposed project
has been designed keeping in view this past experience by adopting a realistic
implementation program, and by keeping Government counterpart funds to a
minimum. The First Provincial Cities Water Supply Project was completed in
1983. The Project Completion Report, completed in May 1984, is currently
under review by OED; it noted satisfactory achievement of the project's
physical and institutional goals. However, it also highlighted the need to
re-examine LWUA's charter and financial policies (para. 1.10).
1.13      Bank Role and Lending Strategy.  The Bank's role in the sector is to
assist the Government in the implemtntation of its continuing program in the
sector, which is well conceived, but for which it has very limited resources.
In the context of the country' s currently constrained economic conditions, the
Bank expects to assist the Government in formulating sector priorities and
investment programs. The Bank's past involvement in the sector has been
instrumental in helping the Government to develop a well conceived institu-
tional framework and policies for the sector. Past experience has indicated
the need for certain revisions and adjustments. The Bank expects to continue
to advise the Government in these areas.



II. THE PROJECT
Project Origin and FormuLation
2.01      The proposed project arose out of a joint Bank/MWSS review of
investment priorities in the wake of the country's deteriorating financial
condition, and the subsequent decision to focus in the short- and mediumr-term
on completion of ongoing works and the expansion of the distribution networks
in order to maximize the use of existing excess production capacity. Some of
these proposed immediate works were originally included in MWS II financed by
the Bank. The implementation of this project has slipped by about two and a
half years, initially because of delays in the construction of water supply
headworks (funded by ADB), and more recently the financial failure of several
large contractors (attributed to the country's economic crisis), necessitating
cancellation and re-award of several contracts. The delays combined with
rapid local inflation have resulted in substantial cost increases, from about
P 1.5 billion to P 3.0 biLlion (see Annex 1). However, because of successive
devaluations of the peso the costs expressed in US dollars remained at roughly
the same level as estimated at appraisal ($200 million). Under SAP, the Bank
agreed in November 1983 to increase the disbursement percentage for civil
works from 40Z to 65Z, which will result in the full utilization of the
proceeds of the Bank Loan by about April 1986, and leaving MWSS with a
financing gap of about $20 million (out of a total value of unfinished works
of about $30 million). Completion of these works is of the highest priority
in MWSS' program, since without them the headworks and related works already
completed cannot be utilized. The proposed project will finance this gap
together with additional distribution works of about twice this magnitude.
The project was prepared-by MWSS staff and appraised in May 1985.
Rationale for Bank Involvement and Project Objectives
2.02      The short-term objective of Bank involvement is to assist MWSS to
optimize utilization of existing infrastructure and thus significantly improve
the level of internal cash generation and financial performance. The longer-
term objective is to preserve and strengthen MWSS' institutional development
and financial position to achieve its longer-term sector development objec-
tives. The Bank's involvement is particularly important during the currently
constrained economic conditions.
2.03      One of the means of achieving the above objectives is the proposed
project. Specifically, the project would improve water supply in the MWSS
service area through: (a) the full utilization of the additional water pro-
duction and distribution facilities made available under MWS II, (b) extension
of the distribution system to unserved areas and infilling of the MWSS distri-
bution network; and (c) the provision of service connections and public stand-
pipes, thus increasing water sales and revenues. The project also includes
institutional support to improve efficiency in implementation, operation and
financial administration. The proposed project would provide water to many
unserved low-income areas, and in this way improve living conditions for the
urban poor.

The Project Area and Water Demand and Supply
2.04      The MWSS service area covers the whole of Metropolitan Manila, as
well as the city of Cavite and 10 other municipalities contiguous to the
metropolitan area; in total it covers about 150,000 ha and has a population
estimated at about 7 million in 1984. Population growth in the metropolitan
areas alone was about 4.5% per year in the 1970s, and is now estimated at
about 3X per year.
2.05      Total water consumption from all sources in Metropolitan Manila in
1985 is estimated at about 2,000 Mi/d.  Of this, MUSS supplies 1,400 Ml/d with
the remaining coming from private groundwater supplies. About 65% of the
total consumption is for domestic purposes and 35Z for commercial and indus-
trial purposes. It is estimated that about 70% of the Metropolitan Manila
population obtains water directly or indirectly from the public water supply
system. About 80% of the domestic but only about 27% of the industrial con-
sumption is supplied by MWSS. The unserved consumers, who rely on groundwater
have to be particularly targetted in the future to arrest the continuing
deterioration of the already over-exploited acquifers. In 1981, the
groundwater level throughout most of Metropolitan Manila was 50 m to 200 m
below sea level, resulting in extensive saline intrusion.
2.06      MWSS' total production capacity is about 2,600 Ml/d.  From an actual
total production of about 2,100 MI/d MWSS supplied, after water losses, about
1,400 Ml/d in 1985. This left an excess production capacity of about
500 Ml/d. Projections of future demand, based on the estimate of population
and income growth, per capita consumption levels (in 1985, 175 I/cd with a
range of 217 1/cd for people with individual house connnections and 50 llcd
for the low-income population in "blighted areas"), price and income elastici-
ties of demand, and a reduction in non-revenue water indicate that the current
MUSS production capacity should be sufficient until about 1995. Total demand
will by that time have grown to about 3,000 Ml/d. With MWSS supplying about
2,300 Ml/d from existing facilities, about 700 Ml/d would still be required
from groundwater sources. Draft legislation has been prepared to improve
control over groundwater extraction in an attempt to conserve this resource.
This proposed legislation will be further processed when MUSS is able to offer
alternative forms of supply to the affected areas. The Metropolitan Manila
area will continue to depend heavily on groundwater until major new surface
water sources are developed. The long-term projection of water demand and
supply (see Annex 2 for Water Demand and Supply Projections) shows that the
next major phase of water supply source development, referred to as MUS III,
should be on-stream by about 1995.
Project Description
2.07      The project has the following main components:  (a) completion of
the ongoing works started under MWS II, including construction of about 3 km
of bulk water supply mains and construction of about 17 km of primary and
secondary networks, as well as tertiary networks, and installation of about
100,000 metered house service connections; (b) construction of about 8 km of
additional bulk water supply mains; (c) connection of about 72 subdivisions to
the distribution network, including installation of meters and service connec-



tions to serve about 15,600 households; (d) infilling of about 24 areas with
secondary and tertiary distribution pipelines including installation of meters
and service connections to serve about 13,500 households; (e) provision of
tertiary pipelines, yard connections and public standpipes in about 160 low-
income areas to serve about 70,000 poor households; (f) acquisition of about
100,000 domestic, industrial and commercial water meters; (g) improvements to
the distribution system through the installation of control valves; (h) drill-
ing and equipping about 5 deep -wells including pumps and storage reservoirs;
(i) zuture project preparation including updating of engineering and financial
studies needed for the future MWS III project and micro-seismic monitoring at
the future Laiban dam site; (j) Institutional support and development includ-
ing provision of consulting services to assist MWSS with project implementa-
tion and the super--cion of an integrated action program to achieve service
connection targets and general management support; acquisition of about
110 vehicle3, mainly utility trucks and motor cycles, for project implementa-
tion and supervision to improve operational performance; purchase of computer
equipment and services to upgrade customer records, billing, accounting and
engineering; training of staff to improve operational efficiency, and meter
maintenance practices; and undertaking aerial photography to verify and
improve customer records, and assist in the detection of illegal connections
and thus improve billing efficiency. (Details of Institutional Support
describing the above are given in Annex 3.)
Project Costs and Financing
2.08      The cost of the project, including physical and price contingencies,
and interest during construction 'IDC) of about P 222 million ($11.0 million),
is estimated at about P 1,947 million ($96.3 million). The project cost
excluding IDC amounts to about P 1,726 million ($85.3 million), of which
P 806 million ($40.0 million) or about 47X would be the foreign exchange
component. The total IDC was computed on the basis of the interest and other
charges payable by MWSS to the Bank during the implementation period. Import
duties and taxes are estimated at about $4.3 million equivalent and are
included in the cost estimates.  Table 2.1 below sulmmarizes project cost esti-
mates and details are provided in Annex 4.

Cost estimates are based on (a) contractors' bid prices for contracts already
awarded by MWSS to complete the major trunk mains and associated works under
MWS II; (b) a study of bids received in early 1995 for similar civil works;
(c) latest quotations by domestic and international goods suppliers who have
recently submitted bids for similar kinds of equipment and vehicles; and
(d) prices and technical assistance contracts executed in 1984 and 1985.
Costs for consultant services estimated to total about $728,000 equivalent
include 39 man-months of internationally-recruited consultants and 100 man-
months of local consultant services. All costs are expressed in end-1985
prices. Physical contingencies have been estimated at 10Z for new works with
completed detailed engineering and 15% for works in blighted areas. It is
estimated that exchange rate adjustments would, on the average, maintain
"*purchasing power parity" during the project implementation period. Price
increases are assumed to be 15% in 1986, 10% in 1987-88 and 8S thereafter for
domestic costs; and 7.0Z in 1986-87, and 7.5% thereafter for foreign costs.
Price contingencies over the project period are equal to $7.9 million or about



- 10 -
10.2Z of the base costs plus physical contingencies of new works. Contingen-
cies for the ongoing works are included in the contracts as awarded.
2.09      The proposed Bank loan of $69 million would finance 75Z of the total
project cost (including IDC but excluding duties and taxes); and would cover
$48 million of the foreign exchange cost and $21 million or about 46% of local
costs. MUSS will contribute the remaining 25% of total project costs from
corporate funds. The contribution from MWSS corporate funds is reasonable
given the level of the debt servicing commitments, the new income and other
taxes payable and the size of the investment program. To support MWSS' total
investment program, including the proposed project, government contributions
of about P 350 million in 1986, and P 300 million in 1987 will be required.
During negotiations the Government confirmed that the requirements for 1986
and 1987 were provided for in the Government's investment plans. The amount
of $8 million included in the loan to finance IDC would cover the interest and
other charges incurred during the first four years of the five year implemen-
tation period. The MWSS financing plan for its total investment program,
including the proposed project, during the implementation period is summarized
in Table 2.2 below.

Implementation
2.10      The project is expected to be implemented over a five year period,
from January 1986 to December 1990.  Earlier projects financed by the Bank



- 11 -
have been handled by the Special Projects Office (SPO) established within MWSS
to manage all foreign-assisted projects. It was recently decided to disband
SPO following the completion of the ongoing works. Accordingly, new works
under the project will be handled by the relevant Departments, i.e., Engineer-
ing for design, Construction for contract supervision and administration,
Customer Services for the connection program, and Finance for project account-
ing. The activities undertaken by the separate Departments will be coordi-
nated by the Senior Deputy Administrator, who formerly headed SPO. He will be
assisted by consultants to advise on and monitor performance of the water
distribution and rehabilitation programs. Construction activities will be
undertaken by prequalified contractors, and house connections will be made by
accredited plumbing contractors and in-house teams. MWSS already has trained
and experienced teams but additional staff are being recruited and trained to
support the expanding program. These implementation arrangements are
satisfactory.
Status of Project Preparation
2.11      The project is in an advanced stage of preparation.  The surveys and
designs for the project components are carried out by MWSS' Design Division.
This Division has been carrying out similar projects routinely. Additional
temporary staff is being recruited to expedite surveys and drafting. MWSS'
staff are also preparing the cost estimates and bid documents. The proposed
works are relatively straight forward and are based upon hydraulic modeLs
developed by the consuLtants for MWS II. The review of hydraulic analysis has
confirmed that there would be satisfactory residual pressures in all parts of
tertiary system. The areas that are included in the project for the provision
of service connections were prioritized on the basis of least-cost per connec-
tion and this ranking is satisfactory. The designs for all of the 24 InfilL-
ing Areas, covered by 19 contract packages, are in progress and bidding for
five packages will commence in March 1986. The designs and contract packages
for four out of the 72 subdivision works are now ready and eight packages
representing 37 contracts are scheduled to commence in June 1986. A typical
contract document to be used throughout the project period for all distribu-
tion related civil works has already been forwarded to the Bank, reviewed and
found satisfactory (Detailed Implementation Schedules are given in Annex 5 and
Monitoring indicators in Annex 6).

2.13      The estimated total value of civil works under the project is about
$72.4 million which includes contracts valued at about $29.5 million already
started under MWS II and previously awarded under international competitive
bidding procedures (ICB). Of the remaining civil works contracts a major bulk
water supply main estimated to cost about $5.5 million will be awarded under
ICB. Civil works for minor water distribution works, totalling about
$37.4 million, involve about 100 small contracts varying in costs from $5,000
to $600,000 equivalent. Scattered through Metropolitan Manila and to be
executed over a five-year period, these contracts are not likely to attract
foreign bidders and will therefore be awarded to prequalified contractors,
through LCB in accordance with MWSS' procedures which have been discussed and
are satisfactory to the Bank. LCB does not preclude foreign firms from
bidding. Contracts for goods (water meters, vehicles, and computer equipment)
totalling about $7.0 million equivalent will be procured by ICB in accordance
with Bank guidelines. Qualifying domestic manufacturers will receive a pre-
ference in bid evaluation of 15% or the import duty, whichever is less. Items
of goods will be grouped by category in appropriate bidding packages, costing
not less than $500,000 each for water meters, and $300,000 each for vehicles
and computer equipment. Minor items of equipment not exceeding $200,000 each
and up to an aggregate amount of $3,000,000, will be procured through local



- 13 -
competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Coods contracts
costing less than $15,000 each and totalling not more than $200,000, may be
procured by prudent local shopping. Technical assistance will be provided by
Consultants hired in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contract review will be
applied as follows: all contracts over $200,000 for goods, over $100,000 for
civil works, and all terhnical assistance contracts will be subject to the
Bank's prior review. This will cover about 80% of value of goods contracts
and about 60Z of value of civil works contracts (net of the value of such
contracts already awarded under HWS II). Other contracts will be subject to
selective post-award review.
Disbursements
2.14      Proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed as follows:  (a) 100%
of the CIF cost of directly imported goods; or 10OZ of ex-factory costs of
locally manufactured goods; or 65Z of the cost of imported goods procured
locally; (b) 70% of expenditures on civil works contracts; and (c) 100% of the
expenditures on technical assi.stance and training. Disbursements under minor
contracts for civil works, goods and for training services (costing less than
$25,000 equivalent each) will be made against statements of expenditure based
on actual payments to the supplier. Supporting documents for such expendi-
tures will be retained by MWSS and made available to Bank missions for inspec-
tion. To expedite loan disbursements, a Special Account of $6 million
corresponding to four months estimated maximum expenditure will be esta-
blished. Disbursement is expected to be completed in 5½ years rather than the
8 years country disbursement profile for the urban/water sector because the
project is a continuation of, and is complementary to, the earlier MWS II
Project started in 1978. About 35% of the project cost is accounted for by
contracts which were awarded under MWS II and are scheduled for completion in
1987. (A Disbursement Schedule is attached as Annex 7.) The closing date for
the loan would be December 31, 1991.
III.  INSTITUTIONAL AND FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Borrower and Executing Agency
3.01       The Borrower would be the Republic of the Philippines.  The
proceeds of the loan would be onlent to ?'WSS, the implementing agency which is
a government owned public utility, on the same terms and conditions as the
Bank loan. MWSS would carry the foreign exchange risks. MWSS' Board of Trus-
tees formulates policy, determines staffing levels and remuneration, considers
and approves budgets, and recommends tariff adjustments. By virtue of a
recent Presidential Decree (PD 1940) a Deputy Minister of Public Works and
Highways is ex-officio Administrator of MWSS and a member of the Board. Four
out of seven Board members are appointed by the President of the Philip-
pines. The award of major contracts and tariff increases also require Presi-
dential approval. The recently appointed Administrator has initiated, with
Presidential approval, a reorganization of MWSS. This reorganization is
satisfactory and promotes a greater specialization and increased decentraliza-
tion of operations. The Administrator is supported by a Senior Deputy Admini-



- 14 -
strator who assists the Administrator on all matters pertaining to day to day
activities. (see Annex 8 for MWSS Organization Chart). The decentralization
proposals initiated under MWS II will now be fully implemented. The Branch
Offices will be increased in number and will be strengthened to establish
closer contact with the customers, and will have responsibility and accounta-
bility of their jurisdiction. Each Branch Office will be responsible for
meter reading, collections and general customer services. The Branch Offices
will be supported by six Service Centers, of which four will cover domestic
and small commercial/industrial services in the Metropolitan Manila area, one
the outlying Cavite area, and one the large commercial and industrial consum-
ers. Of the authorized establishment of about 7,700 positions about 6,000 are
occupied; more than half of these are casual or contract labor. The staffing
ratio of 16 persons per 1,000 connections will be improved over the next five
years to reach about 12 persons per 1,000 connections. This ratio includes
personnel engaged on construction activities. The ratio covering operations,
administrative and finance staff only, will be nine personnel per 1,000 con-
nections by about 1990, which is considered satisfactory. The improved ratio
will be achieved through limiting new recruitment, and retraining staff from
construction to operation activities.
Operations and Maintenance
3.02      MWSS operates and maintains the water production and treatment
facilities to good standards. However, in the past, the maintenance of the
distribution system, much of which is quite old, was inadequate. Firstly,
most of MWSS' efforts were devoted to the implementation of MWS II and the
Sewerage and Sanitation Projects. Secondly, due to the age of part of the
distribution system, the increasing water pressure from new source works
completed recently under MWS II resulted in more leaks. In the last two
years, however, there has been a major shift in emphasis starting with the
ADB-financed Rehabilitation Project which comprises an accelerated program of
repair and replacement of the old distribution network. This project also
includes institutional measures to strengthen MWSS' procedures and maintenance
organization. Specifically, the distribution network has been divided into
about 120 zones with prioritization for rehabilitation based on: (a) zones
with above-average water losses; (b) densely populated zones with high proba-
bilities of illegal connections; and (c) zones that have received little or no
attention under earlier programs. Control over rehabilitated areas will be
achieved through the placement of bulk meters in individual zones. This will
provide the means for comparing water delivered in each zone with water
billed, and hence monitor water-loss trends. In addition, procedures will be
reviewed and staff will be trained to improve field inspections and leak
repair methods. In the past year, progress on this project has lagged; how-
ever, MWSS has submitted to the Bank an action program, already agreed with
ADB, for implementation of the rehabilitation project. This program was
reviewed at negotiations and agreement was reached to implement it in accord-
ance with an agreed time schedule and to review progress annually against the
agreed targets.

Training
3.03      MWSS has a well established staff training program.  Its Human
Resources Development Division (HRDD) has a staff of 24 which, because of the
increasing importance of this function, is expected to be increased. It also
uses outside trainers as the need arises. HRDD is one of the most succesful
sector training centers in the region. Through successive lending operations
to MWSS, the Bank has assisted substantially in creating and developing a
strong, versatile, and well equipped Training Division. A specially designed
Training Center has been established to provide practical training covering
basic and more advanced skills in water supply and sewerage operations. The
training program is not only for MWSS operators and supervisors but also for
contractors' staff. Over the past few years, training priority has been given
to meet the need for additional operational staff. HRDD has a five-year
training program covering the period 1984-1988. The variety of courses
offered include pipe laying, leak detection, preventive maintenance, plant
operations and water treatment, meter repairs, supervisory and management
skills, customer relations and administration. The 1984 program was
substantially achieved in terms of the range of courses offered and persons
trained.
Financial Aspects
3.04      The profitability of MWSS has steadily improved from a net profit of
P 54 million in 1978 to P 346 million in 1984. From a low of about 4% in
1980, the financial rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in operation,
after a fourfold increase in the rate base, reached about 6Z in 1984. These
results are due to significant revenue efforts by MWSS in increasing the aver-
age revenue per cubic meter of water sold from P 0.66 in 1978 to P 2.08 in
1984. Consequently, the contribution to its investment program from internal
cash generation, after debt servicing, increased from about P 80 million in
1978 to about P 400 million in 1984. At the same time, the annual investment
in water supply and sewerage system development also increased substantially
from a modest P 90 million in 1978 to P 2,600 million in 1984.
3.05      These commendable efforts by MWSS however did not succeed in achiev-
ing a rate of return for its water supply operations of 8Z on revalued net
fixed assets in operation, as agreed under MWS II. The main reason for this
was the delay in completing the transmission works under MWS II, and in
providing the additional service connections. Consequently, MWSS suffered
from significant under-utilized production capacity. MWSS' financial
performance, particularly internal cash generation, has also been severely
affected by successive devaluations of the peso since MWSS carries the
exchange risk on its foreign loans. The loans for MWS II (Ln. 1615-PH) and
the Metropolitan Manila Sewerage and F?nitation Project (Ln. 1814-PH), for
example, were obtained when the rate of exchange was US$1 = P 7.4. The rate
of exchange at appraisal of the proposed project was US$1 = P 18.7. As a
result, MWSS's debt servicing costs increased by about 150%. In response to
the cost increases, the Government has already approved a number of successive
monthly tariff increases (See Axn,ex 9 for tariff increases June 1985-April
1986). Because of time lags these have not yet fully compensated for the most
recent devaluation. It appears, however, that under the current economic



- 16 -
conditions, in which the real level of household and most business incomes
have been declining, MWSS and the Government have made a reasonable effort to
increase revenues and control costs. (Details of Historical Financial
Performance is given in Annex 10.)
3.06      A financial projection of MWSS' operations shows that an 8Z rate of
return could be reached by about 1988. This is based on an increase in tar-
iffs of about 40% (already approved in 1985 for implementation by about mid-
1986 and further increases beyond 1986 in line with the growth in incomes) and
reduction in physical water losses from 32Z to 25Z, and in administrative
losses from 22Z to 15Z. With successive tariff increases, the average water
tariff by 1990 of about P 7.20/cu m would be close to the average marginal
cost of water of about P 7.00/cu m. Some of the future tariff increases could
be achieved through adjustments in the tariff structure. At present, water
consumption up to 30 cu m per connection per month is charged at subsidized
block rates.  Consumption in excess of the basic minimum should, where
possible, be paid for at the economic cost of water production. Because of
the need to maximize internal cash generation to maintain its development
program and financial viability, agreement was reached at negotiations that
MUSS will: (a) achieve an annual rate of return on its revalued net fixed
assets in operation of not less than 6X in 1986, 7% in 1987, and 8% per year
from 1988 onwards, (b) not incur any long-term debt unless a debt servicing
ratio of not less than 1.5 can be maintained, and (c) for the purpose of
(a) above, MWSS will carry out annual reviews of the level and structure of
its water supply and sewerage tariffs and other charges, furnish such reviews
before June 30 to the Bank for its comment, and implement any recommendations
agreed in accordance with a time schedule acceptable to the Bank. The first
such review, for 1986, shall specifically address the water and sewerage
tariff structure. The projected level of financial performance will ensure
that beyond 1987, MWSS will be fully self-sufficient and able to finance its
future investment program from internal cash generation and borrowing.
Changes to MWSS' liability for taxes, recently instituted, are incorporated in
the financial projections. Annual updates of MWSS' investment program and
financing plan will be prepared by MWSS and reviewed by the Bank semi-
annually. To accommodate its expanding financial structure, and hence permit
increased capitalization, MWSS has obtained an amendment to its Charter. The
Charter amendment was reviewed at negotiations and found appropriate. (A
Detailed Financial Projection is attached as Annex 11 and a Summary of
Assumptions Used in the Financial Projections as Annex 12.)
Billing and Collection
3.07      A considerable proportion of water consumed, estimated to be as high
as about a quarter of total production, is not charged to consumers. This is
in addition to about 30% physical losses, which covers water produced but not
reaching the consumer, due to leaks. These problems are being addressed with
ADB assistance (para. 3.02). MWSS also included in its recent reorganization
the strengthening of the Customer Services Department and Branch Offices to
cope with the increase in billing and collection over the next 5 years. New
billing and collection procedures have already been prepared and others
dealing with meter reading are under preparation. The proposed project will
assist in this effort through financing an aerial survey which will form the



- 17 -
basis for a comprehensive survey of illegal connections. In addition, the
improvement in speed and accuracy of billing will be facilitated through the
purchase of computer equipment included in the project. The equipment will
also help MWSS to better control Accounts Receivable, improve general finan-
cial administration, and handle the almost doubling of service connections and
hence billings over the next five years. Accounts Receivable stand at about
six months sales which is excessive. A large proportion, about 30Z of the
total, is due from other Government agencies and Local Governments. During
negotiations agreement was reached that the Government will ensure that any
water and sewerage charges due to MWSS be settled by the Government's agencies
and Local Governments in accordance with an action plan satisfactory to the
Bank. MWSS will make more intensive use of the inter-agency clearing office
for the settlement of these overdue accounts to reduce the level of Accounts
Receivable, and continue its efforts to write off bad debts. During negotia-
tions agreement was reached that MUSS will ensure that its Accounts Receivable
do not ezceed the equivalent of four months billing, and take all necessary
actions to write off its uncollectable Accounts Receivable in accordance with
standards acceptable to the Bank.
Accounts and Audit, and Reporting
3.08      MUSS' accounting procedures are satisfactory.  Financial statements
up to and including 1984 have been satisfactorily audited by the Commission on
Audit. In addition to its normal financial accounting records, MWSS will
maintain project accounts to record separately project expenditures for review
by the Bank. MWSS' Annual Financial Statements, Project Account and Special
Account to be established for the proposed project and Statements of Expendi-
ture, would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The
financial statements, together with the Auditor's Report would be miad  avail-
able to the Bank within six months after the end of each financial year. MWSS
would submit quarterly reports on the implementation of the project.
IV. EGONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSiS
Project Benefits
4.01      The continuing program of water supply development in Metropolitan
Manila will. during the implementation period 1986-90, improve service to
about 2.3 million people. Specifically, the proposed project will provide
access to piped water supply for 1.6 million people not previously served by
MUSS. The project will also contribute to arresting the growth of over-
pumpage of the rapidly depleting groundwater (para. 2.05). In financial terms
the project will significantly contribute to improve the level of internally
generated funds to enable MWSS to meet its increasing debt servicing costs,
tax liabilities and self-finance a larger share of its future investment pro-
gram. The water charge for poor families at the 20th percentile of household
income distribution is estimated to average about 2.5% of their income; this
is within the range considered affordable for low income households (An
Affordability Calculation is attached as Annex 13). Through progressive
tariff increases water would be priced by 1990 at marginal cost. The Finan-



- 18 -
cial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) of the project amounts to about 40%. It
takes into account the incremental operating revenues and costs and the
capital costs of the project. A sensitivity test assuming a reduction of 1OZ
in estimated benefits and a 10% increase in estimated operating and capital
costs shows that under these adverse conditions the FIRR would amount to about
26%. (The Internal Rate of Return Calculation is attached as Annex 14.)
Poverty Impact
4.02      A large proportion of the urban poor are adversely affected by
inadequate access to potable water. As a result they have had to purchase
water from private vendors at a relatively high cost. The proposed project
will particularly benefit this segment of the population. The per capita
Gross National Product in the Philippines is about $660 (P 11,000). According
to Bank guidelines, the relative urban poverty line in the Philippines in
1984, is at an annual income of about P5,400 per capita. In Metropolitan
Manila about 402 of the population is beLow this threshold. To cater for the
needs of these people, special provision is made in the proposed project for
the installation of public standpipes and yard connections in the blighted and
other densely populated low-income areas. It is difficult to estimate the
precise impact of the project on the poverty group since project benefits
accrue to the population at large rather than to any particular group.
Because of the poverty focus in the project it is estimated that about 20% of
the water distributed and of the project cost would benefit the urban poor.
Environmental Impact
4.03      The project would improve health and environmental conditions
through the provision of potable water for drinking, food preparation and
washing. More significantly it includes the first initiatives to reduce the
usage of groundwater and hence attempt to protect against further excessive
groundwater depletion of the aquifer in the Metropolitan Manila area. The
distribution of additional water in the future and the slowdown in development
of sewerage and sanitation facilities will make additional demands on existing
sewerage, sanitation and drainage facilities. While this will not necessarily
lead to an immediate deterioration in environmental conditions, further
improvements in sewerage and sanitation should be a priority when economic
conditions improve.
Risks
4.04      There are no unusual risks associated with this project.  The major
challenges to MWSS are to meet the water connection and water loss reduction
targets and thus generate more water revenues. These challenges are being
faced through a large number of initiatives by MWSS, involving many different
departments and numerous small contractors. The management and coordination
of these many activities, in what must be regarded as the two most difficult
tasks in water supply development, will preoccupy the MWSS management. How-
ever, through the recent reorganization which included a strengthening of the
upper levels of management, decentralization of operations aid a continuing
staff training program, MWSS has taken the appropriate steps to minimize the
risks associated with the successful implementation of the proposed project.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMHENDATION
5.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the folLowing:
The Government shall:
(a) take all necessary actions to ensure that any water and sewerage
charges due to MWSS be settled by the Government's agencies and
local governments in accordance with an Action Plan satisfactory to
the Bank (para. 3.07).
MWSS shall:
(a) annually update its investment program and financing plan for the
following five fiscal years, furnish them to the Bank by
September 30th each year, and review the program and plan with the
Bank semi-annually (para. 1.08);
(b) implement a relabilitation program in accordance with the agreed
action program (para. 3.02);
(c) achieve an annual rate of return on its revalued net fixed assets in
operation of not less than 6% in 1986, 7% in 1987, and 8% per year
from 1988 onwards (para. 3.06);
Cd) for the purpose of (c) above, carry out annual reviews of the level
and structure of its water and sewerage tariffs and other charges
beginning 1986, furnish such reviews by June 30th each vear to the
Bank for its comment, and implement any recommendations agreed in
accordance with a time schedule acceptable to the Bank (para 3.06);
(e) not incur any long-term debt unless a debt servicing ratio of at
least 1.5 can be maintained (para. 3.06); and
(f) ensure that the Accounts Receivable do not exceed the equivalent of
four months billing and take all necessary actions to write off its
uncollectable Accounts Receivable in accordance with standards
acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.07);
Recommendation
5.02      On the basis of these agreements and conditions, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$69 million at the current variable interest
rate to be repaid over 20 years including 5 years of grace. The borrower
would be the Republic of the Philippines.

PHILIPPINES
METROPOLITAN WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE SYSTEN
METROPOLITAN MANILA WATER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Water Demand and Supply Projection
1.        Introduction.  This projection is carried out in a number of steps
as follows:  (i) population projections are used to provide the basis of
domestic demand; (ii) the total demand by each category of consumer (domestic,
comercial and industrial) in the whole of MUSS service area is estimated;
(iii) an assessment is made of the extent to which this demand can be met by
MWSS on the basis of its production and distribution capacity; (iv) projec-
tions are then made as to how the remainder of the population will be served
through the private extraction of groundwater; and finally (v) reference is
made to the rate at which physical water losses are planned to be reduced.
This projection methodology was prepared by consultants and has been reviewed
by Bank staff and is appropriate.
2.        Future demand for water in the MUSS service area is a function of
population growth, per capita consumption, and demand by the large commercial
and industrial sectors. The latent demand for water was projected on the
basis of the quantities of water which would be consumed if there was suffi-
cient water available at adequate pressure, as influenced by the projected
price of water, growth of household incomes and industrial/comuercial output
and estimated income/output and price elasticities of domestic, commercial and
industrial customers. The main assumptions and results are given in the
following paragraphs.
3.        Domestic Demand. Future domestic demand in the MWSS service area is
estimated for three consumer groups: i.e. (a) the general population, (b) the
"blighted" population, i.e. people who live under conditions of social depri-
vation, and (c) the urban development beneficiaries (UDS), i.e. people who
will benefit from specific programs to upgrade slum areas. Average per capita
demand for water was estimated at about 220 1/cd for the general population,
about 130 1/cd for the urban development beneficiaries, and about 50 1/cd for
the blighted population in 1985. These figures were based on a survey of
domestic consumption carried out by MWSS consultants in 1983 in preparation of
MWS III. The population projections for the MUSS service area are based on
the National Census and Statistics Office medium-range forecast. Over the
20 year projection period, from 1981 to 2001, the population growth rate
averages 2.4Z per year, falling from 3.0Z between 1982-86 to 2.01 in 1997-
2001. About 4OZ of the growth derives from in-migration and 60% from natural
increase. It is assumed that a high proportion of in-migrants (75%) are from
the poorer sections of the provinces and will settle in blighted urban
areas. The growth rate of per capita domestic demand was based on: (a) pro-
jected real growth o; income for the general population and the urban develop-
ment beneficiaries of -1.01 in 1986, 2.51 in 1987, and 3.0% per year from 1988
onwards and 1.51 in 1986 and 22 from 1987 onwards for the blighted population,
(b) tariff increases beyond those already approved for 1986, in line with



ANNME 2
-22 -                               Page 2
income growth so that the real cost of water as a percentage of household
income remains unchanged, and (c) income elasticity of 0.5 for all domestic
consumers and price elasticity of about -0.2 for the general population, about
-0.1 for the urban development beneficiaries, and zero for the blighted
population.
4.        With the above price and income elasticities of demand, projected
growth in per capita income, and tariff increases, the growth of per capita
domestic water demand is projected to average +0.8% for the general population
(indicating some increase in consumption as curtailed by the progressive
tariff structure which penalizes large consumers), +1.2% for the urban deve-
lopment beneficiaries (showing an increased demand for water as living condi-
tions and accessibility improve), and +1.0 for the blighted population
(reflecting the basic need for a life-line supply of water).
5.        Commercial Demand.  Commercial consumption in 1981, excluding that
for the very small commercial consumers who are considered a part of the
domestic sector, was about 460 Ml/d of which 85Z was met by MWSS. Assuming
tariff increases as for the domestic sector, along with output and price
elasticities of about 1.1 and -0.1, respectively, and a 2Z growth rate of
commercial output in 1986, 2.5Z in 1987, 3.6% in 1988, 4.0% in 1989, and 3.5%
in the following years, the projected annual growth rate of commercial demand
is about 1.3% in 1986, about 2.4% in 1987, about 3.5Z in 1988, about 3.9% in
1989, and about 3.4% per year thereafter.
6.        Industrial Demand.  The water consumption by the industrial sector
in 1981 was estimated to be about 410 M8/d. MWSS supply contributed about
70 Ml/d or 17% but the major supply comes from privately owned wells. The
growth of industrial demand has been projected using the same methodology and
tariff structure as for the commercial demand, but with output and price
elasticities of 0.8 and -C.1, respectively, and projected growth rates for the
industrial sector of about 2.5% in 1986, about 4.5% in 1987, about 5.5% in
1988, about 6.0% in 1989, and about 4.5% p.a. thereafter. Accordingly, the
projected growth rate of industrial demand is about 1.2% in 1986, about 3.3%
in 1987, about 4.0% in 1988, about 4.4% in 1989 and about 3.2Z in 1989 and
beyond.
7.        Total Demand.  Projections of total demand are given in Table 1.
Total latent demand (as defined in para. 2 above) is estimated at about
2,200 Mi/d in 1986, and is projected to rise to about 3,000 Ml/d by about
1995.

8.        MUSS Water Supply.  At present, the MWSS system cannot meet the
latent water demand for the whole of the MWSS service area as set forth in the
above table, due mainly to constraints imposed by the water distribution net-
work and the inadequate number of service connections. That part of the
demand which could be satisfied by MWSS surface and groundwater supply, on the
basis of an implementation of the proposed project, is detailed by consumer
category in Table 2 below. The remaining demand must be either met from
groundwater or suppressed until supply increases. Future development of the
MWSS surface water distribution system and later of the water supply head-
works, will be necessary to meet the projected growth of demand and gradually
reduce the over-exploitation of groundwater resources. Table 2 shows MUSS'
production capacity and the required productions after allowing for production
losses, to meet the projected distribution levels. As the distribution capa-
city is constrained, there will be a surplus production capacity till about
1994. The required level of water production is estimated at about 2,300 Mi/d
in 1986, and projected to rise to about 2,700 Ml/d by 1995; the latter would
exceed the MWSS surface and groundwater supply of about 2,600 Ki,d. To meet
the shortfall a start should be made in about 1989 of the next major water
development phase so it is onst-eam by about 1995; however, this may not be
achievable because of the newly imposed tax liability which will reduce MISS'
internal cash generation.

9.        Private Groundwater Supply.  A comprehensive survey was carried out
by consultants to determine groundwater use, and obtain data on groundwater
levels and quality. The survey identified about 2,300 wells discharging about
660 Ml/d in 1983. In addition, an estimated 20,000 shallow wells produce
about 40 Ml/d. Virtually all of the pumpage is in the highly urbanized
areas. The industrial sector is the predominant user of groundwater, and may
be expected to continue to do so, until MUS III is completed. The survey
findings indicated that at the current rate of extraction the groundwater is
grossly over-exploited; there has been an atcelerating decline of groundwater
levels over the past 25 years. By 1981, the groundwater level was 50 m to
200 m below sea level throughout most of Metropolitan Manila, and was further
declining at the rate of 4 to 10 meters per year. Available data are inade-
quate for a precise forecast of future degradation of the groundwater system,
but it is clear that if present practices are continued much of the economic
utility will be sacrificed in the next two decades.
10.       It is estimated that between 1983 and 1985 private ground water
supply had already declined from about 700 Ml/d to about 600 Ml/d. While new
wells, particularly in the outlying areas, have been commissioned, many others
in the central area have run dry, and in coastal areas turned saline. It has
been estimated that private groundwater supply will continue at about 500 Mi/d
in the period 1986-95. The groundwater situation will continue to deteriorate
until adequate surface water supply by MWSS is made available. MWSS has a
proposal for the taxing of groundwater extraction; this has been submitted to
the Government but, because of the political/economic situation, it does not
foresee acceptance of these proposals until MISS can provide an alternative
form of water supply in the affected areas.

11.       Water Losses.  The projections for MWSS and private water supply
described above, assume that physical water losses, which amount to about 30Z
of MWSS's total production in 1985, could be reduced to 25Z by 1988, 191 by
1990 and about 15Z by 1993. This level of improvement is projected on the
basis of intensive maintenance and leak repair programs and other initiatives
being implemented under the ADB-financed Rehabilitation Project. This project
includes the replacement of an estimated 130,000 leaking service connections,
200 km of defective minor mains, replacement and repair of about 5,000 valves
ana Locating and legalizing or sealing off spaghetti and other illegal connec-
tions. It will be implemented over a four year period at an estimated cost of
about US$63 million equivalent.
Conclusions
12.       In order to test the sensitivity of demand and supply, several
projections were made on the basis of varying assumptions. However, it was
found that the single most significant variable was the rate at which physical
water losses are reduced. If improvements take place at a much slower pace
and the proportion of losses to total production would remain at about 30X by
1990, the full current water production capacity would be utlized before the
end of the current decade. As the next phase will not be onstream until about
1995, it is imperative that MWSS reduce the share of water losses to ensure
that adequate supplies can be maintained. The implementation of the ADB-
assisted Rehabilitation Project, which provid . the main thrust in reducing
on-revenue water, will be reviewed by future Bank missions. (Details of
population growth, latent demand, groundwater supply, water losses, consump-
tion, and MWSS distribution and billings are given in the following tables.)

METROPOLITAN WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE SYSTEM
METROPOLITAN MANILA WATER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Description of Institutional Support
1.        Apart from the physical water supply development which is taking
place, MWSS is also gearing up to cope with the almost doubling of the number
of service connections planned over the next five years, 1986 to 1990. Beyond
that period, the prospect of a heavy construction phase with a possible start
on the Third Manila Water Supply Project (MUS III) is envisaged. To assist
MUSS to meet these challenges the proposed project includes appropriate Insti-
tutional Support, such as consulting services; acquisition of motor vehicles
for project implementation, operations and supervision; and purchase of
computer equipment.
Consulting Services
2.        While the proposed project does not require a large consulting
services input it was agreed that valuable support could be given in the
following three tasks.
(a) MWSS is receiving a limited consulting input with the implementation
of the Second Project. Now that MUS II is reaching completion it is
important that this support be continued at this stage to monitor
adherence to implementation schedules. The consultant engaged for
this purpose would also assist with the preparation of the Project
Completion Report for the Second Project. The project includes four
man-months of foreign consultants support in the field and one from
home office support and 60 man-months of local consultants support.
(b) NUSS is entering an important phase in its institutional develop-
ment. The implementation of the rehabilitation project and the
proposed water distribution project will require considerable
coordination and monitoring of performance to achieve water loss
reduction and water meter connection targets. This responsibility
falls in the office of the newly appointed Senior Deputy Administra-
tor. It was agreed that services of a senior consultant experienced
in water supply management would be a valuable contribution to
assist with the supervision of the service connection program and
related activities to improve MUSS' overall performance. This
service could be either full-time over the first two years, or
intermittently over the five year project implementation period.
Consultant advice will also be needed to formulate and assist with
the phased implementation of the computing facilities to be
expanded. Accordingly, a provision of 24 man-months of foreign
consultant support from a highly qualified water supply manager with
considerable experience in construction, operations, and financial
administration is included in the project.



-33 -                               ANNEX 3
Page 2
(c)  The proposed MWS III project is in an advanced stage of project pre-
paration. On present indication, it should be on-stream by about
1995. Using a typical implementation profile for this type of
project implies a construction start by about 1989. In anticipation
of a reactivation of this project, a provision has been made in the
proposed project for consulting services to update demand and supply
projections, implementation schedules, cost estimates and bidding
documents for the future MWS III project. A provision of 10 man-
months of foreign consultants support and 40 man-months of local
consultants support has been included.
B.  Acquisition of Motor Vehicles
3.        MWSS presently rents about 370 vehicles from two private motor
vehicle leasing companies to carry out its operational activities. The
limited supply source has resulted in lack of competition by the suppliers and
hence cost increases to MWSS. To reduce the total dependency on this limited
supply, to increase competition amongst the private suppliers and lower
leasing costs, and to ensure an adequate availability of vehicles to equip
teams to meet meter connection and water loss reduction targets, MUSS proposes
to acquire about 110 vehicles, including about 80 utility type vans for the
transportation of working teams, about six vehicles for the use of senior
staff for general management and supervision of project implementation,
20 motor cycle vans for use in operational activities such as leak verifica-
tion, pump operation, etc. and three water tankers to serve remote low income
areas.
4.        Proposed acquisitions include:  (a) About 30 units Wagon Type, about
1,000 cc, like Suzuki Beaver or equivalent (P 130,000/unit); (b) About
40 units, Double cab type, Diesel Engine, 2,200-2,600 cc (P 200,000/unit);
(c) About 10 units, Utility Vehicle, 2,200-2,600 cc AUV-Jeepney Type or
equivalent (P 170,000/unit); (d) About 6 units, sedans (P 200,000/unit);
(e) About 20 units, Motorcycle Van, powered by 125-155 cc motorcycle
(P 70,000/ unit); and (f) 3 units, Water Tanker, of about 19,000 liter
capacity (P 1,500,000/unit).
5.        MUSS can handle the maintenance of the additional vehicles within
the existing motor vehicle repair facilities because it has provided for the
recruitment of additional motor mechanics. The improvement of MUSS' own
maintenance capacity will reduce dependence on the outside leasing companies
which often adversely affects MWSS' ability to provide transportation for the
field working teams.
C. Purchase of Computing Facilities
6.        The proposed phased acquisition during 1987-90 of additional
computer equipment, peripherals and microcomputers for the MWSS Headquarters,
Btanches and Service Centers is primarily aimed to meet the increasing comput-
ing needs associated with the more than doubling of service connections by
1990. It will also offer additional computing facilities to the different
MUSS Departments, Divisions and Offices to maintain and develop new compute-



-34-                                ANNEX 3
Page 3
rized applications in inventory control, accounting, operations and corporate
planning through the 1990's. The computer system needs up to one million
service connections operating on a database/on-line environment. The total
number of service connections by 1990 is estimated to reach about 800,000.
The need for improving computing capacity was first identified in 1982 by a
consultants study done jointly by Sycip, Gorres, Velayo & Co. (SGV) and
Societe Generate pour L'Industrie (SGI). Subsequent studies by MWSS staff,
supported by consultants, and the experience gained to date with the use of
outside computing services shows that the planned expansion should no longer
be deferred. The microcomputers proposed in the Branches and Service Centers
were configured based on the study conducted by Camp, Dresser, McKee and SGV
(CDM/SGV) consultants funded under the ADB financed Rehabilitation Project.
7.        The Five-Year Computer Development Plan (1985-89) has identified the
major applications to be developed. These are: Database/On-Line Integrated
Billing and Collection System, Inventory Control (Parts Management) System,
Accounting and Financial applications, and Engineering and Operations
applications. Other sub-systems identified in the approved Management
Information System (MIS) are expected to be integrated together with the
reporting applications to higher management levels. As a general rule, MWSS
will adopt a decentralized data processing concept in pursuing its future
computerization program. The Branches and Service Centers would use free-
standing microcomputers where this is more economical than using the main
frame computer. Bank reviews of the proposals show that there are several
alternative ways to expand the MISS computing facilities. It appears that a
decentralized system for customer records at each of the Branches, combined
with main frame capabilities at the MWSS Offices for accounting, inventory
control and technical application is the preferred alternative. Consultants
would assist to further develop the proposals, where possible making use of
experience of the other large public utilities and suppliers to assist with
the phased implementation. Bank staff would review proposals and monitor the
phased implementation.

METROPOLITAN WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE SYSTEM
METROPOLITIAN MANILA WATER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Assumptions Used in Financial Projection
1.        Implementation Period.  The major variable in the financial
projection is the assumption about the implementation period. The executing
agency, MWSS, has a plan to implement the project over a period of three
years. In view of the experience with the implementation of the Second
Project, the multiplicity of tasks to be carried out (including the large
numbers of small contracts to be administered), and the typical disbursement
profile, a more confervative implementation period of five years was used in
the projections. This assumption does not debar MWSS from adhering to its
proposed shorter implementation schedule.
2.        Revenues.  Forecasts of revenues are based on: (a) the demand and
supply projection (the major variables include population growth, domestic,
commercial and industrial demand, and the rate at which additional connections
will be provided), and (b) average tariffs required to meet the proposed
financial performance covenant (this assumes that tariffs will be increased in
line with the movements in household incomes). See Demand and Supply
Projection in Annex 2, and the Connection Program in Annex 6.
3.        Non-Revenue Water.  Of the total quantity of water produced a pro-
portion does not produce revenues, it comprises: (a) physical losses either
during production, or because of leaks in the distribution system, and water
used for pressure testing and flushing newly constructed mains, and
(b) administrative losses which covers water reaching the consumer but not
paid for because of either under-registration of meters, incomplete customer
records, or illegal connections. The financial projection includes assump-
tions as to the rate at which these losses can be reduced.

Page 2
4.        Doubtful Debts.  The long-term average for the period 1975 to 1984
shows a collection efficiency of 92%, ranging from a low of 86% to a high of
99%. Given the relatively stable average rate of 92% and taking account of
the beneficial effects of the new initiatives by MWSS, a continued provision
for doubtful debts at 8% per annum has been included in the projections. This
provision is reasonable.
5.        Operating Costs.  Those costs which vary directly, even though not
necessarily in proportion, with water supply and sewerage operations are
classified as direct operating costs. This includes direct operating wages,
power, chemicals, and maintenance costs. These costs have been estimated on
the basis of the relationship between water production and projected unit cost
increases. Wages and other personnel costs are based on detailed costings
prepared for the recent reorganization. Indirect operating costs are those
expenditures which do not directly vary with water and sewerage operations,
they include management salaries, office rentals, computer usage, and general
administration.
6.        Depreciation.  The weighted average depreciation rate has been
estimated at 2.5% p.a. indicating a weighted average economic life of assets
of 40 years; this includes all physical works used in water storage (dams,
intakes and reservoirs), production, treatmpnt and distribution, and sewerage
works, and plant and office buildings.
7.        Inflation.  Estimates of inflation are as follows:  15Z in 1986, 10%
in 1987 and 1988, and 8% p.a. thereafter.
8.        Revaluation.  Revaluation of assets each year is based on a weighted
price index covering local and foreign costs of project investments, and
exchange rate adjustments derived from purchasing power parity calculations
for the preceeding year. The revaluation procedures and methodology were
approved by the Bank and are appropriate. The effects of the recent increases
in value because of inflation and devaluation of the Peso has been taken into
account in the projection.
9.        Equity Contributions.  Government support at a level to bridge the
financing gap in 1986 and 1987 has been included in the projections. Beyond
those years, internal cash generation and the increasing financial strength of
MWSS assures that any future financing gaps can be bridged by loans or bond
issues.
10.       Foreign Loans.  It is assumed that loans for the implementation of
the next major stage of water supply development and the Second Rehabilitation
Project due to start in about 1989, will be funded on the same terms and
conditions as those which currently apply to Bank loans.
