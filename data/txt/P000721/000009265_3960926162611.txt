MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
FOR A SEVENTH EDUCATION PROJECT
1.         The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to The People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia for SDR
53.0 million (US$ 70.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and
help finance a seventh edueation project.
2.         Background.  Relative to most African countries, especially
those with a low per capita income, Ethiopia has a well managed, balanced,
equitable, low-cost, and efficient education system. This favourable
situation is the product of the government's competency, administrative
continuity, prudent management and IDA's support for the quantitative and
qualitative expansion of the system over the last 20 years. The impact of
IDA's relationship with Ethiopia is visible at all levels ane for all types
of education, but most strikingly in the comprehensive curriculum reform,
and the efficient textbook and didactic materials production activities of
the Ministry of Education. Ethiopia's educational policies are generally
sound, and aim both at widening the benefits of a basic education to all
its population (e.g. literacy programs are now emphasizing women as a
target group) and at meeting priority manpower requirements, while keeping
costs under control, and generating local contributions where feasible
(e.g. through community contributions to the construction of primary
schools, fees for textbooks, and fees for evening and extension courses).
Nevertheless the system is now facing three major problems: (a) despite its
balanced structure it reaches only a relatively small percentage of the
population; (b) a rapid expansion over the past decade creates a permanent
challenge regarding maintenance of educational qtuality and strengthening of
managerial capabilities; and (c) serious shortages of higher level
qualified manpower continue to exist in agriculture and industry, as well
as in accounting and other commercial activities. The educational
institutions on average are able to meet only about half of the manpower
requirements in these critical fields; and for some fields such as
agriculture, the quality of the training is often unsatisfactory. The
proposed project, in line with past projects, would address these
quantitative, qualitative and managerial needs of the specific segments of
the education system. Any subsequent projects would continue to address
the needs for expansion at all levels, although on a broader sectoral
basis.
3.         Project Objectives.  Consistent with overall government
strategy, the proposed project seeks to: (i) improve middle and higher
level manpower training with emphasis on agriculture, foiestry, engineering
and teacher training; (ii) continue or reinforce the quality in the
provision of primary, secondary and tertiary education and equitj of the
primary level; and (iii) strengthen administration and management of the
education system.



--2-
4.         Ponet  Descrition.  The project would consist of three major
groups of components corresponding to each of the above objectives. In
terms of Manpower Development, the project would provide for limited
expansion and improvement of training in:  agriculture (professional and
sub-professional levels); forestry (professional level); engineering
(professional atd sub-professional levels); teacher training (degree and
non-degree); and post-graduate training in selected areas of crucial
importance for the economy (accounting, agricultural research, sciences).
Regarding Quality and Equity Improvement, the project would: (i) address
general education quality needs through provision of improved instructional
practices, and provision of educational materials and practical training
equipment to secondary schools; (ii) improve post-secondary education
through augmented library resources and examination services; and (iii)
improve equity by providing new basic education facilities to particularly
needy locations. In the area of Institutional Development the project
would improve planning, administration and management capabilities of the
system by providing technical assistance and training for the Ministry of
Education and Commission for Higher Education. A small provision is also
made to support education innovations in areas such as the use of
information technology, the standardization of examinations, and the
training of medical doctors.  The project, to be carried out over 61 years,
provides funds for civil works, vehicles, furniture and equipment,
training, technical assistance and incremental operating costs. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$ 95.2 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$ 52.3 million (55%). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Ethiopia are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
6931-ET dated December 8, 1987, is also attached.
5.         Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Association has made major
contributions to policy formulation, institution building and overall
development of the education system in Ethiopia through its lending program
and by means of sector work. This project is a continuation of earlier IDA
contributions and represents its support of a governmental strategy in
education which has evolved through the years. That strategy is based on
parallel expansion of basic education, training for productive employment,
development of quality and improvement of managerial capabilities.  As                V
such, the project is expected to play an important role in consolidating
the results so far achieved by the Government in developing the education
and training system in Ethiopia.
6.         Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, Government agreed on the
following: (a) link the intake of Alemaya University of Agriculture to
manpower demand estimates; (b) submit to the Association for review and
comment detailed plans for the short cycle graduate courses; (c) establish
a revolving fund for books by June 30, 1988; and (d) submit annual
workplans and annual reports on project execution. Government also
submitted a letter of intent regarding the development of the education
system.

7.         Benefits.  The proposed project would meet quantitative and
qualitative manpower needs primarily in agriculture, engineering,
accounting, and teaching. It would also build upon earlier IDA efforts to
improve the quality and equity of the general education syst---., as well as
planning and management capabilities. In addition the project would
support innovations that may increase the system's cost effectiveness
(e.g. experimental ad hoc masters degree courses, teacher training by
distance education, a textbook fund, an improved maintenance system, etc.).
8.         Risks.  No major risks are anticipated.  Past experience with
implementation of education projects has been generally good and it is
expected that Government will rely on the existing, and well tested,
Project Management Office to coordinate implementation.
9.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
