PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Thailand Second
Tree Crops Pre'ect, for which a loan of US$142.0 million was signod January
29, 1982. The project was jointly financed with the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC), which provided an initial loan of Sterling Pounds 10.0
million and a subsequent loan of Sterling Pounds 5.0 million. The CDC loans
were fully utilized. The Bank loan Closing Date was March 31, 1987. The
final disbursement was made on November 26. 1986; &nd a., unutilized balance of
US$326,413 was cancelled February 2, 1987. Concurrently, the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) prcvided grant assistance of US$1.1 million to
finance technical assistance, training and equipment.
The PCR was prepared by the Borrower's Office of the Rubber
Replanting Aid Fund (ORRAF). The PCR is accompanied by an Overview prepared
by staff oi the Asia Region which sheds further clarification on a number of
issues raised in the PCR, and summarizes the main lessons cierging from the
project experience.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR waa sent to the Borrower and Cofinancier for comments. The
Borrower's comments are attached to the Report (Attachment I).

THAILAND
SECOND TREE CROPS PROJECT (LOAN 2078-TH
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUIMARY
Bckr,ound
1.       The Second Tree Crops Project, financed under Loan 2078-TH, con-
tinued Bank support for a successful rubber replanting program initiated by
the Royal Thai Government (RTG) in 1960. Specifically, the project
included: (a) a four-year time slice of t'ne program of the Office Of Rubber
Replanting Aid Fund (ORRAF) to replanst 50,000 ha of rubber per year, to
bring to maturity about 29,000 ha replanted under a previous project (Loan
1243-TH), and to provide technical support for new planting on a pilot
basis; and (b) assistance to the Department of Agriculture (DOA), the Land
Development Departmer.t (LDD), and the Office of Agricultural Economics
(OAE) to strengther. their capability to support the future development of
the tree crop industry.
Proiect Obiectives
2.       The main objectives of the project were: (a) to increase the
income levels of smallholders living on relatively poor soils in rainfed
areas by expanding rubber production; (b) to improve the country's balance
of payments by increasing rubber exports; and (c) to lay the foundation for
further de-uelopment of the tree crops sector nationwide.
Prolect Desigp and Organization
3.       ORRAF prepared the pr- ject with support from a FAO/UNDP team
based on the experience gained from a previous Bank-financed project (Loan
1243-TH). Original proposals included new planting of rubber and coconut
development, but the Bank reduced the scope by omitting these components to
be consistent rith ths terms of referetlce of ORRAF at the time.
4.       There were three main implementing agencies for the project:
(a) Rubber aesearch Center (.RC) - responsible for research ar-" -roduction
of foundation stock; (b) Department of Agriculture Extension (i'.) -
responsible for extension after the trees come into production; and (c)
Office of Rubber Replanting Aid Fund (ORRAF) - responsible for supply of
inputs, administration of the replanting fund, general extension before the
trees come into production and for overall co-ordination of the project.

Proiect Costs and Fnacn
5.       The total project cost was estimated at appraisal to be US$ 358.8
million (Baht 8,251.8 million), with external financing of US $160.5
million (World Bank US$ 142.0 million and CDC L 18.5 million). No major
changes were made in projoct content or timetable during project implemen-
tation, but the Bank had to adjust loan disbursement percentages and CDC
had to make an additional loan of L 5 million (US$ 2.7 million) during
FY1984, to support ORRAF's financial position which deteriorated with
falling rubber prices. US$ $326,413 of the Bank loan was recovered from
the Special Account and cancelled at loan closing. Mainly because of
reduced labor and fertilizer costs and depreciation of the Baht, final
project cost was US $280 million (about 80% of appraisal estimates). Bank
financing covered 50% of total costs (compared with 40% expected at
appraisal) and CDC's share covered 7% (compared with 5% expected at
appraisal).
Project IRmlementation
6.       Implementation was smooth, despite a six-month delay in the loan's
becoming effective, due to the impact of declining rubber prices on revenue
from the cess on rubber exports which supported the Replanting Fund and
ORRAF's finances. Despite this delay, the project was completed on time
and replanting waa 18% above the appraisal target. Local and overseas
training were successfully completed. The performance of all the
implementing agencies was satisfactory. All major covenants were complied
with, except the reorganization of the Rubber Research Center (RRC), which
was not accepted because of budgetary constraints. The performance of
local consultants was satisfactory. The assistance of UN3P/FAO consultants
contributed immensely to the satisfactory implementation of the project.
Proiect Results
7.       The project exceeded production objectives.  Replanting was 18%
above the appraisal target of 200,000 ha. Due to a change in clone mix
during implementation, the average yield has been revised from 1,022 kg/ha
per tapping year to 1,260. With the actual replanting at a higher yield
on 235,955 ha, instead of the appraisal target of 200,000 ha, incremental
production should be 4,088 thousand tons (31% higher than appraisal) with a
value of about US $3.8 billion (in constant 1982 prices) over the 30 year
life of the project. This is only 17% abive appraisal estimate because
current rubber price forecasts are about 57% below appraisal estimates.
8.       The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) is estimated at completion to be
14.6%, virtually the same as the 15% estimated at appraisal. Higher rubber
yield and lower fertilizer and labor costs offset lower rubber price
forecast.
9.       About 130,512 plots with average size of 1.8 ha were replanted
compared with 166,000 plots with average size of 1.2 ha planned at
appraisal. Total farm income from rubber at full development is expected
to average about US $958 p.a., only 12% less than the appraisal target.



Proiect Sustainabiliet
10.      There is little doubt as to the sustainability of the project.
The trees have been properly established, the farmers have been well
trained, the level of field husbandry is high and the jurisdiction of ORRAF
has been extended for an additional two years of the production cycle to
ensure that the productive potential of the trees is maintained. The main
project risk is a possible decline in the price of rubber. However, the
long-term prospect for rubber is encouraging.
Bank Performance
11.      The Bank's major contribution to the project was in providing
financing for ORRAF's accelerated replanting program and in addressing
ORRAF's organizational and financial constraints. The Bank showed a good
blend of flexibility and firmness in helping to resolve the financial
crisis at ORRAF (para. 5) that delayed the loan's becoming effective. To
provide a long-term solution to ORRAF's financial problems, the Bank
introduced covenants in the follow-up project (Ln. 2691-TH), for the cess
to be calculated at a flat rate and for the share of the cess allocated to
meet ORRAF's expenses to be increased from 5% to a minimum of 10%.  These
measures were finally approved in the December 20, 1987 amendment to the
ORRAF Act.
12.      The Bank carried out seven supervision missions, two in
association with CDC. Relationships were generally good among the Bank,
CDC and ORRAF and between them and the other implementing agencies.
Lessons Learne
13.      The main lessons which emerge from this experience, which may be
relevant to similar tree crops projects in Thailand and elsewhere, relate
to the importance of having:
(a) an effective organization responsible for both disseminating
technical knowledge and coordinating the supply of improved
planting materials and other inputs;
(b) a financially stable agency responsible for implementing the
project;
(c) specific. lines of responsibilities with a clear distinction of
functions for all participating agencies;
(d) good arrangements for collection and marketing of output;
(e) adequate incentives for the farmers to replant and to adopt
improved technologies; and
(f) adequate measures to meet farmers' subsistence needs during the
immature stage of the rubber trees.

1.       The agriculture sector has played an important though declining
role in the economy of Thailand.  At project appraisal (September 1980),
agriculture employed on a full-time or part-time basis about 75% of the
labor force, produced about 30% of gross domestic product and provided
about 60% of total export earnings. With about 4.5 million farm families
occupying 24 million ha, farm sizes were necessarily small, although
distribution was not particularly skewed.  Some 90% of total cultivated
area was rainfed and only 10% irrigated. Rice was by far the predominant
crop, accounting for over 60% of the cultivated area. Tree crops (rubber,
coconuts, coffee, cocoa, oil palm, fruit trees) accounted for about 108 of
the aggregate value of a-Licultural production.  Rubber was by far the
single most important tree crop, contributing 12% of total export earnings.
2.       Overall agricultural growth had been excellent during 1960-79,
averaging about 5  p.a., based mainly on expansion of the total area under
cultivation  until the mid-1970s;  and  thereafter primarily  on
intensification and movemnt into higher value crops. Production increases
in irrigated areas were largely due to the introduction of higher yielding
varieties, complemented by greater reliance on inputs such as fertilizer
and pesticides. However, in many rainfed areas, the poor natural resource
base and lack of appropriate technologies had begun to seriously constrain
further growth of production and incomes. Also, the exhaustion of readily
accessible new lands by the mid-seventies was leading to a steady
encroachment on forest reserves and on land only marginally suitable for
sustainable agriculture.
3.       Because rubber grows better on poor soils than do many other cash
crops like maize and sugar cane, it had become the main source of
agricultural diversification and poverty alleviation in the more humid
areas of Southern Thailand.  About 53,000 farm families were engaged in
rubber-growing, but at least 5 million people actually benefitted dlrectly
from rubber, as planters, tappers, traders and processors. During 1960-80,
rubber production had been increasing at about 6% p.a., largely as a result
of the successful investment fund administered by the Office of Rubber
Replanting Aid Fund (ORRAF). Slightly over one-fifth, or about 345,000 ha,
of the rubber areas of the South had been replanted during this period,
with the annual rate of replanting growing from 12,000 ha in 1970, to
20,000 ha in 1976, and 50,000 by 1980. When the Second Tree Crops Project
was appraised in !.980, it was estimaced that another 420,000 ha of over-
aged and low-yielding trees still needed to be replanted.

4.       Since its establishment in 1960, ORRAF had evolved into one of the
most efficient public agricultural  institutions in Thailand.   ORRAF
administered rubber replanting grants to smallholders from funds it
received through a coss levied on rubber exports, supplemented by interest
earnings and, when necessary, Government subventions. ORRAF applied 5 of
the cess proceeds to the Rubber Research Center (RRC), 5% to cover its own
administrative expenses, and returned the remaining 90% to farmers in the
form of replanting grants. These grants were provided both in kind (high-
yielding clonal planting material and r%quired inputs, such as fertilizer
and agro-chemicals) and cash after satisfactory completion of specified
tasks during the immature period of rubber.   With the exceptions noted
below (paras. 11, 24), ORRAF continues to operate in the same manner today.
Prolect Obiectives and Description
5.       The project continued Bank support initiated under an earlier,
successful Rubber Replanting Project (Loan 1243-TH) 1/, with some
additional features to promote development of the tree crop subsector
nationwide. The main objectives of the project were to: (a) increase the
income level of smallholders living on relatively poor soils in rainfed
areas by expanding rubber production; (b) improve the country's balance of
payments by increasing tubber exports; and (c) lay the foundation for
further tree crop development.
6.       The main project components were:
(a) a four-year time-slice of ORRAF's ongoing program (including
replanting at a rate of 50,000 ha p.a., continuation
and completion of about 212,000 ha of replanting started
in earlier years, technical support for about 16,000 ha of
new rubber development, and training and technical assistance
for ORRAF's staff in cultivation of coconut and related
intercrops such as coffee and cocoa); and
(b) assistance to the Department of Agriculture (DOA) to
strengthen its Rubber Research Center (RRC) and to establish
60 ha. of coconut seed gardens; to the Land Development
Department (LDD) for a land-use survey of the coconut-growing
areas in six provinces in the South and for preparation of a
proposal for a nationwide land-use survey; and to the Office
of Agricultural Economics (OAE) to strengthen agro-economic
planning to support the tree crops subsector.
Part (a) of the project accounted for 98% of total costs; part (b) for 2%.
I/ The first project was co-financed by the Bank (Loan 1243-TH) and CDC.
It had assisted ORRAV to implement technical improvements through
replanting of 150,000 ha, raising the annual replanting rate fror
20,000 ha to 50,000 ha, a level considered appropriate to replant the
backlog of low-yielding rubber by the early 1980s and to keep pace with
regular replanting requirements. It also provided technical assistance
and training to strengthen ORRAF's organizational structure and
operating procedures, planning and implementation capacity.



^ 3 -
7.       ORRAF's original project request had also included substantial new
planting of rubber and coconut development, but it was not clear that RTG
had given or proposed to give ORRAF wider responsibilities for all tree
crop activities in Thailand.   The Bank therefore decided to reduce the
scope of the project to make it consistent with the level of ORRAF's
responsibilities at the time. As indicated above, new rubber planting and
coconut development were undertaken on only a pilot scale, merely to lay
the foundation for ORRAF to become the lead agency for all tree crop
programs at a later stage, if RTG so decided.
Proiect Costs and Financins
8.       The total project cost was estimated at appraisal to be US$358.8
million. It was financed by Loan 2078-TH, of US$142.0 million, intended to
cover the foreign exchange component (40% of total project costs).   The
Loan was signed on January 29, 1981, and became effective on October 22,
1982.   The project was co-financed by the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC), which provided an initial loan of Sterling Pounds 10.0
million in 1982 and a subsequent loan of Sterling Pounds 5.0 million in
1984. Concurrently, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) provided
grant assistance of US$1.1 million to finance technical assistance,
training and equipment. The CDC loans were fully utilized. The original
Bank Loan Closing Date was March 31, 1987; however, the final disbursement
was made on November 26, 1986 and the Loan account actually closed early on
February 2, 1987, when the unused balance of US$326,413 was recovered from
the Special Account and cancelled.
9.       Soon after Loan signing, ORRAF faced the onset of aL financial
crisis which caused a six-month delay in the Loan's becoming effective
(from April 29 to October 22, 1982) and ultimately changed the Bank's and
CDC's cost sharing arrangements for the project. Low rubber prices in 1982
had been reducing ORRAF's cess income, which Government was unable to
supplement fully because of general budgetary constraints. ORRAF therefore
advised the Bank that large deficits would make it impossible to implement
the replanting program as planned at appraisal and suggested an increase in
the Loan amount.   Loan effectiveness was postponed pending a solution to
the problem, which finally came in the form of an agreement by the Bank to
increase its Loan disbursement percentages for several categories
(principally fertilizers and chemicals, from 65% to 80%) during FY83, after
which the percentages were to be slightly reduced to ensure that the Bank's
final participation rate would revert to the intended 40% of total costs
(para. 8) by the time of Loan closing.  CDC also raised its disbursement
percentages and, for its part, RTG gave assurances that it would provide
the necessary counterpart funds to complete the planned program. With the
immediate problem overcome, the Loan was declared effective.
10.      By mid-1983, however,  it became apparent that ORRAF's financial
problems would not be shortlived.  Estimates suggested that continued low
cess revenues and reduced Government budgetary contributions would result
in a potential cumulative deficit in ORRAF resources on the order of US$86
million, by end-FY86.   At the same time, reduced fertilizer prices and
lower quantities than anticipated ae appraisal would result in



- 4 -
lower total project costs, with savings of US$63 million and US$1 million,
respectively, under the Bank and CDC loans.   Government therefore
requested, and the Bank agreed, to fully utilize these potential savings
to offset ORRAF's deficit, by reallocating loan amounts and increasing
disbursement percentages for several loan categories (again, the most
impottant increase was for fertilizers and chemicals,  for which the
disbursement rate was raised from 63% to 85%). It was expected that this
would raise the Bank's overall participation rate from 40% to 58% of total
project costs,  including some local cost financing.   Bank management
considered this acceptable since: (a) the Board had recently approved a
participation rate of 60% ior a Provincial Roads Project, and (b) it was in
accordance with the recommendations of the Special Action Program developed
for Thailand.   CDC also provided a supplementary loan of Sterling Pounds 5
million in February 1984 to help ORRAF cover its administrative expenses.
11.      While these short-run solutions helped ORRAF to withstand the
immediate financial crisis and ensured that the project would be
implemented as planned, it was agreed that the long-term solution would be
to set the cess at a flat rate, rather than a percentage, so as to cushion
ORMAF's finances against fluctuating rubber prices.   It was also agreed
that the share of the cess allocated to cover ORRAF's administrative
expenses should be raised from 5% to a minimum of 108. These measures were
later reflected in the Loan Agreement for the Third Rubber Replanting
project (Loan 2691-TH), of May 13, 1986, and were finally approved in the
December 20., 1987 amendment to the ORRAF Act.
12.      No major changes were made in project content or timetable.
Mainly because of reduced fertilizer prices and requirements mentioned
above (para. 10) and depreciation of the Baht, the final project cost was
only US$286.0 million, or about 80% of appraisal estimates. Bank financing
covered 508 of total costs (compared with 40% expected at appraisal) and
CDC's share covered 7% (compared with 5% expected at appraisal).
Pro1ect Imolementation
13.      Despite ORRAF's  financial problems and the delay in Loan
effectiveness, total replanting reached 97% of the appraisal target by the
end of FY85 and 118% by Loan closing in FY87 (para. 16). Both local and
overseas training programs were successfully completed.  Within ORRAF, a
new organizational structure was adopted to decentralize authority and
improve efficiency, based on the recommendations of a UNDP-financed
personnel management consultant. Also, a computer consultant was hired to
make recommendations for the computerization of ORRAF's operations at its
Headquarters and in its provincial offices.   Implementation by the other
agencies involved (DOA, OAE and LDD) was also satisfactory. The target of
60 ha of coconut seed gardens was established at Kanthuli Rubber Research
Center, with an additional 13 ha at Trang Horticultural Research Station.
The Land Use Survey of coconut growing areas was compleced by LDD.  OAE
encountered problems in contracting consultants to assist it, and therefore
used its own staff to conduct five socio-economic studies to evaluate the
feasibility of planting rubber in the tlortheast and to assess the economics
of coconut production.



. 5 -
14.      The institutional arrangoments for the proje ct were sound.
Specific lines of responsibility. with a clear delineacion of functions
were *stablished early on and there were sufficieno numbers of qualified
personnel to implement the project. The three main implementing agencies
were the Rubber Research Center of Thailand (RRC, later expanded to the
Rubber Research Institute of Thailand when two additional centers were
established), responsible for research and production of foundation stock;
the Department of Agricultural Extension (DOAE), responsible for extension
after the trees came into production; and ORRAF, responsible for supply of
inputs, administration of the replanting fund, general extension before the
trees came into production. and overall coordination of the project.
Marketing and processing were carried out effectively and efficiently by
the private sector.
15.      In retrospect, there were no major weaknesses in the desin and
organization of the project, which was simple and based on the experience
of the earlier, successful project financed under Loan 1243-TH. The
targets were realistic; management and organization were good. The overall
success of project implementation is largely attributable to ORRAF's
competent management and to the flexibility exhibited by the Bank and CDC
in helping to solve the financial crisis at the outset of the project.
Relationships were generally good among the Bank, CDC and ORRAF and between
them and other participating agencies. An issue did arise when it became
apparent that premature tapping was still being practiced by some graduated
replanters. This was resolved by ORRAF agreeing to continue to provide
technical ass--'stance for ar additional two years under the follow-up
project (Loan 2691-TH). A second issue, which was also successfully
overcome, had to do with the need to reconcile Bank guidelines and RTG
regulations on procurement of fertilizers.
Proliect Results
16.      The project exceeded its production objectives.  By the end of
FY85, total replanting was 193,539 ha, or 97% of the appraisal target (PCR
Annex 1II, Table 3). By Loan closing, 235,955 ha had been replanted (PCR
Table 4), which wvs 18% above the appraisal target of 200,000 ha. Average
yield at appraisal was estimated at 1,022 kg/ha per tapping year. However,
due to changes in the clone mix (in particular, the use of the clone RRIM
600, ou of the highest yielding and proven clones available, throughout
75? of the total planted project area v. less than 10% of the area as
assumed at appraisal), the average yield increased to 1,260 kg/ha per
tapping year. With actual replanting at higher yield on 235,955 ha instead
of 200.000 ha, incremental production should be about 4,088 thousand tons
(31% above appraisal expectations), with a value of about US$3.8 billion
(constant 1982 prices) over the 30-year life of the project, This value is
only 17% above appraisal estimates because current rubber price forecasts
are about 57% lower than the prices used at appraisal. Net foreigr.
exchange earnings over the 30-year life of the project would be about
US$3.0 billion.



17.      The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) is estimated at completion to be
14.68, virtually the same as the 15% estimated at appraisal. Higher rubber
yield and lower fertilizer and labor costs have offset lower rubber price
forecasts.
18.      The income distribution and poverty alleviation goals of the
project are being achieved, although on a slightly smaller scale than
expected. About 130,500 plots were replanted under the project, compared
with 166,000 plots planned at appraisal. The actual average plot size was
1.8 ha, rather than 1.2 ha as originally estimated. Net farm income at
full development is now estimated at Baht 13,300 (US$532)/ha/yr, instead of
the appraisal estimate of Baht 22,600 (US$904)/ha/yr, because of the
decrease in rubber price forecasts between appraisal and project
completion. However, with the anticipated higher yield (para. 16) and
larger plot size of 1.8 ha, annual farm income from rubber at full
development is expected to average Baht 23,940 (US$958), only 12% less than
the appraisal estimate of Baht 27,120 (US$1,085).
19.      Human resource development was enhanced under the project.  ORRAF
trained 7,033 staff and 42,358 rubber replanters in management, operations,
nurseries, planting and field maintenance. RRC/RRIT trained 1,416 officers
and 33,393 farmers in bud-grafting, tapping and other related subjects.
Five professional officers completed post-graduate degrees and 79 others
went overseas for short courses during the project period.
20.      Under the project, replanters were encouraged to produce their own
planting materials instead of relying on ORRAF. ORRAF provided the
budstock and technical know-how and arranged training courses for
replanters on nursery management. Currently about 50% of the replanting
materials are produced by farmers themselves, 38% by private rubber
nurseries and 12% by ORRAF.
21.      The environmental impact of the project was minimal.  The project
replaced old rubber trees with new ones. Lass than 10% of the area needed
terracing to prevent run-off and erosion, and the scattered nature of
plantings limited the impact of such run-off. The small amounts of agro-
chemicals used had no adverse environmental effects. During implementation
the stump-killer 2,4,5-T was replaced by Triclopyr to reduce the
possibility of toxicity.
Project Sustainability
22.      There is little doubt as to the sustainability of the project.
The trees have been properly established; the farmers have been well
trained; and the level of field husbandry is high. The primary
implementing agency, ORRAF, is one of the most successful public
agricultural entities in Thailand. Premature tapping is one of the factors
that could reduce the productive life of rubber trees, but steps have
already been taken under follow-up Loan 2691-TH to extend ORRAF's
jurisdiction over the replanting beneficiaries to ensure that the incidence
of such premature tapping is miniwized.



23.      The main project risk identified at appraisal was the possibility
that insurgency in the South would spread and affect the activities of
ORRAF's field staff, but this did not materialize. On the other hand, the
likelihood of significant rubber price changes and their potential impact
on ORRAF's finances was clearly under-estimated at appraisal.   For the
future, although natural rubber prices are likely to follow a cyclical
path, the long-term prospects are encouraging. The price per ton of rubber
in 1988 constant USdollars is expected to fall from US$1,449 in 1988 to
US$1,083 in 1990; however, it is expected to rise again to US$1,618 in
1995, with only a modest decline to US$1,491 in the year 2000.
Bank Performance
24.      The Bank's major contribution to the project was in providing
financing for ORRAF's accelerated replanting program and in addressing
ORRAF's organizational and financial constraints. The transfer of improved
rubber technology from Malaysia had largel been initiated with UNDP
assistance, prior to the Bank's involveme I n the rubber subsector in
Thailand.   However, the Bank helped to    lement technical improvements
under all three rubber projects (Loans   43-TH, 2078-TH and 2691-TH).
Under the second project,  the Bank also demonstrated a good blend of
flexibility and firmness in helping to resolve the financial crisis at
ORRAF (paras. 9-10). It showed flexibility in adjusting loan disbursement
percentages to provide ORRAF with additional funding, and firmness in not
declaring the Loan effective until RTG agreed to provide the necessary
counterpart funding to carry out tne program as originally planned.  To
provide a long-term solution to ORRAF's financial problems, the Bank
introduced covenants under the follow-up project (Loan 2691-TH) for the
cess to be calciulated on the basis of a flat rate and for the share of the
cess allocated to meet ORRAF's administrative expenses to be increased from
5% to a minimum of 10% (para. 11).  The Bank carried out seven supervision
missions during five years, two in association with CDC. These supervision
missions served to maintain a dialogua with ORRAP staff and helped to
identify problems and offer constructive solutions.
Borrower Performance
25.      ORRAF played the leading role in preparing the project,  in
collaboration with the FAO-UNDP technical assistance team, and in
coordinating project implementation. The performance of ORRAP and of the
other participating agencies was good throughout the project cycle: the
project was well prepared, project management was effective, institutional
arrangements were sound, planning and organization for input supply were
good, and ORRAF maintained excellent rapport with rubber replanters.
26.      The Borrower complied with all legal agreements, except for
implementation of proposals to reorganize RRC, which were not acted upon
because of budgetary constraints.   The Loan Agreement was amended to
increase the disbursement percentages co ORRAF, and to allow for submiss.on
of the Audit Report to the Bank within nine months of the close o'. each
financial year, rather than six months. The Borrower maintained good



* a -
records and submitted progress reports to the Bank regularly. The Borrower
also prepared the PCR and submitted it to the Bank for review before it was
finalized, and all the data relevant to the preparation of the PCR were
readily available.
Consulting Services
27.      The performance of local consultants engaged to assist ORRAF in
developing a socio-economic survey, in evaluating its nursery operations
and in improving staff productivity through computerization was
satisfactory.
28.      OAE was not able to arrange for consultants to advise on ways to
strengthen its agro-economic planning capability for the tree crop
subsector because of delays in finalizing the contract and the resulting
need to change the personnel originally agreed on; the work was performed
instead by OAE staff.
29.      UNDP/FAO provided a long-term foreign consultant for project
coordination, and short-term consultants on soils and fertilizers, plant
breeding, cultural proactices, and economics and planning. UNDP/FAO also
engpged local consultants for socio-economic survey, manpower development,
staff training, production of technical manuals and radio and TV
communications.   These consultancies contributed significantly in laying
the foundations for future development of the rubber industry in Thailand.
Lessons Learned
30.      The main lessons which emerge from this experience, which may be
relevant to similar tree crop projects in Thailand and elsewhere, relate to
the importance of having:
(a) an effective organization responsible for both dissemination
of technical information and coordination of the supply of
improved planting materials and other inputs;
(b) a financia'ly stable agency responsible for project
implementation;
(c) specific lines of responsibility with a clear delineation
of functions among executing agencies;
(d) good arrangements for collection and marketing of output;
(e) appropriate incentives for farmers to replant and to adopt
improved technologies; and
(f) adequate measures co meet farmers' subsistence needs during
the immature stage of the rubber trees.

Basis for Economic Analysis
Definition of the Project for Purposes of the Economic Analysis
1.       The 'with project' situation is considered to include (a) the comple-
tion of the ORRAF replantings presently in the immature stage, including those
initiated under the Rubber Replanting Project I. and (b) new ORRAF programs
includir,g the replanting of an additional 235,955 ha started during the
project.
2.       In the base case "without project" situation, it is assumed that
ORRAF would adequately fulfill its present program by completing the planting
on all areas started prior to the project period, but that it would not under-
take any new replanting. Since the Second Tree Crops Project is defined as
supporting ORRAF*s new program 1982-86, it is analyzed by considering the
return to the entire new program.
3.       Under these assumptions, i.e., no new replanting 'without project",
it is estimated that 'without projecto replanting would take place at a rate
of 5 of each consecutive replanted area 'with project' for a 10-year period.
That is, a total of 23,596 ha, or 102 of the area would be replanted using
farmers' own resources. The other 212,359 ha of land which would not be
replanted 'without project' is considered to be tapped for a further 10 years
then abandoned.
Deviation of Economic Prices
4.       Project output prices for rubber are based on the Banks' commodity
prices projections for 1987-2000 adjusted for international freight, local
marketing costs and quality differentials, expressed in 1982 constant baht.
Calculation for compound fertilizer prices are also the same. They have been
calculated on the basis that 'straights' are imported and manufactured into
compound fertilizers in the country. Details are given in Tables 2-4 of the
PCR. Other prices are based on financial level inflated to 1982 constant baht
using inflation rate shown in Tables 5-12 of the PCR. Prices of some compo-
nents of the cost of individual items are modified by conversion factors.
Cost and Benefits Streams for Rubber Replanting
S.       Benefits in this analysis are considered as the total value of incre-
mental rubber production of the ORRAP FY 1982-86 new program. Economic costs
include the incremental costs of rubber development and the incremental
operating costs of ORRAP attributable to this development. ORRAF's costs of
administering the grant are assumed to equal about 202 of the grant.

I. THE PROJECT
Background
1.1      Rubber remains the most important tree crop to Thailand.  The need to
replant the old rubber holdings with modern high yielding varieties was
realized in 1960 when the Royal Thai Government (RTG) established the Office
of the Rubber Replanting Aid Fund (CRRAP) to administer and implement the
rubber replanting scheme. This was done through grant assistance to the
farmer doing the replantir- with cess collected on rubber exporters. Between
1961 and 1975, ORRAF replanted 160,000 ha but the rate of replanting was con-
sidered low. Through loan assistance from the World Bank (WB) and the Coimon-
wealth Development Corporation (CDC) the first Acceleration Rubber Replanting
Project (Loan 1243-TH) for 1977-80 was successful in raising the annual
replanting rate of about 20,000 hA ?er annum in 1975 to 50,000 in 1980. The
actual area replanted between 1976 an 1982 was 269,893 ha.
1.2      To continue the rubber replanting at 50,000 ha p.a., which is 3Z of
the total rubber area in Thailand and maintain the area already replanted to
bring these rubber trees to maturity, the RTG negotiated for more loans form
the WB and CDC to support the Second Tree Crops Project (Loan 2078-TH) amount-
ing to US$142 million from the WB and L 10 million from the CDC. The latter
sum was increased by another L 5 million to cover the administration cost of
ORRAF. The Loan Agreements were signed on January 29, 1982 and became
effective on October 22, 1982. The United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) provided US$1.09 million as grant assistance to support the project on
technical expertise, training and equipment.
Proiect Obiectives -
1.3      The main objectives of the project weres
(a) to Increase, or at least maintain, the income level of the small-
holder living in relatively poor soils in rainfed areas by expanding
rubber production;
(b) to improve the balance of payments by increasing rubber exports; and
(c) to provide a basis for further development of the tree crops sub-
sector nationwide.
Proiect Description
1.4      The aim of the project was to strengthen and support the RTG's tree
crops development program which had the following main components:
(a) ORRAF - The proposed project was for a four-year duration (April
1982-April 1986) ccverings



- 24 -
Ci) Rubber Replanting.
a. replant old rubber holdings with high-yielding budded
rubber on approximately 200,000 ha involving about 166,000
plots (50,000 ha p.a.), and develop and maintain the
replanted holdings.
b. complete the maintenance of young rubber on approximately
212,000 ha planted before April 1, 1982, involving about
151,400 plots.
(ii)  Training of Fund Staff in the cultivation of coconut and its
intercrops;
(iii) Provision of technical support to smallholders for establishment
and maintenance, throughout the immature period, of new high-
yielding budded rubber; and
(iv) Administration and management activities, including construction
of additional branch offices and provision of vehicles and
equipment.
(b) Other Implementing agencies in Ministry of Agriculture and Co-opera-
tives (MWAC) were as followss
MOA
Ci) expansion and strengthening of the research capability in RRCs
(ii) establishment by DOA of 60 ha of coconut seed gardens in the
South of Thailand; and
(iii) strengthening of the Borrower's Agro-economic planning capabi-
lity to serve and guide the tree crop subsector.
OAE
(i) undertaking by OAR of a study of the potential for tree crop
development nationwide, including the financial, technical and
institutional implications thereofs and
(ii)  training of OAS staff in the economic aspects of tree crop
development, processing and marketing.
LDD
(i) undertaking by LDD of land-use survey of the coconut growing
areas in six provinces in the South vf Thailand and carrying out
a study to assess the current situation in regard to land-use
data with a view to preparing a propoisal for a land-use resurvey
of the country.



II. INSTITUTIONS
OrRanization and Manaaement
2.1      S.nce 1980 and in the Phase IT project pe_iod (1982-86), ORRAF adopt-
ed a new organizational structure based on the recommendations of the Person-
nel Management Consultant (see the organizational chart in Annex 1. Table 1).
This chart gave ORRAF a basis to decentralize autLozity for more efficient and
work output. Specific lines of responsibilities with clear description of
functions were produced and sufficient qualified personnel were able to per-
form their dutie:' well and effectively.
2.2      Changes were also made in the organizational structu:e at the provin-
cial level in anticipation of the increased workload. Short and long- term
plans were designed to bring the distribution of authorities to the appro-
priate management levels. In particular, the functions in operations, finance
and administration were brought in line with the overall organization to
achieve maximum coordination and communicetion.  The provincial organizational
chart is shown in Annex I. Table 2.
Personnel Management
Staff Recruitment
2.3      Since 1982 a policy decision was made to dispense with the recruit-
ment of new officers. During the Phase II Project Period, the staff estab-
lishment of ORRAF is given in Annex I, Table 3-7.
Changes in Manoower Structure and Five Year (1982-86) Manvower Work Plan:
2.4      A one-year and five-year manpower plan -were developed.  They allowed
more efficient distribution of personnel to every unit and section of work
according to the specific requirement. In doing so, better use of human
resources was achieved.
Additional Branch Office
2.5      As per clause 3.10 on Administration under Staff Appraisal Report of
the Second Tree Crops Project (SAR) in page 16, ORRAP had to build 12 new
branch offices in the project period. Due to fina.cial constraint, only two
were built; they were in Chawang and Phangnga costing B 4.15 million and
B 3.5 million respectively.
1II. IMPLEMENTATION
Proiect Schedule
3.1      Loan No. 2078-TN for US$142.0 mil-)oa from WB and L 15 million from
CDC (details of loan allocated shown in Annex 1, Table 1 was obtained for the
project for a four-year period (1982-86). The Loan Agreement was signed on
January 29, 1982 and became effective on October 22, 1982. The delay was
caused by the tight financial situation for ORRAF when the rubber price was



- 26 -
low (see Annex II. Table 2;. There was a large deficit in the RTG counterpart
fund during the early part of the project.
3.2      The project was expected to Le completed by April 1986 but was
actually completed September 30, 1986 while the closing date of loan expected
to be March 31, 1987, actual was October 21, 1986.
ReDlantins Achievement
3.3      A target of 200,000 ha (or 50,000 ha p.a.) was set for the four-year
project period. The results of replantings eiiding September 30, 1986 are
given in Annex III. Table 1-3.
3.4      It can be observed that the area replantea in the first and fourth
years exceeded the targets of 50.000 ha p.a. while the areas replanted in the
second and third years were 98S and 752 of the target respectively. The
decline was mainly due to financial tightness in 198311984 when the approval
area for each of the two year was restricted to not more than the target area
of 50.000 ha p.a. The project achieved 97Z of the target during the four-year
period (FY82-85)
3.5      During the four-year period. 90.057 plots at total area of 110,142 ha
were completed averaging 27,536 ha p.a. (see Annex 'III. Table 4).
3.6      The ongoing replanting area are shown in Annex ITI, Table 5.
3.7      Annex III, Table 6-7 give the values of grant payment (in cash and
kinds) and quantity of fertilizers, chemicals distributed to repianters res-
pectively.
Rubber Nursery
Policy
3.8      The policy of MOAC is to support and encourage farmers to establish
rubber nurseries. ORRAP was required to purchase some quantities of the rub-
ber planting materials from these nurseries. At the same time, ORRAF produced
some planting materials in its own nursery to prevent production monopoly from
the private sector and to keep the price of materials low and constant. Some-
times when the quality of the material was poor and the supply fell short from
the private sector, the ORRAF materials would be used as supplement.
3.9      Incouragement was given to the replanters to produce their own
replanting materials. ORRAF provided materials and technical know-how and
arranged training courses for interested rep'lanters on nursery establishment.
3.10     At present the policy and practice of ORRAP on production and supply
of rubber planting materials is as follows:
(a) Fifty percent or over of the materials would be produced by the
replanters themselves.



- 27 -
(b) Thirty eight percent of the materials to be purchased from the pri-
vate sector preferably from private rubber nurseries.
(c) Twelve percent of the materials would be roduced by ORRAF nursery.
TyDes. Production and Consumption
3.11     In the Project period (1982-85) there were between 1,756 and 2,052
rai of budwood nurseries producing 32.3 million budwood and 79,000 meters of
brown budwood representing 44.582 and 39.50? of the production targets respec-
tively. The low rate of the production was mainly due to low consumption rate
of ORRAF nurseries. Private nurseries generally have their own budwood
nurseries.
3.12     However, it is necessary for ORRAP to maintain surplus production to
ensure that budwood of the required planting material are available at all
times to meet the demand.
Cost of Production of Rubber Plantinz Materials
3.13     The breakdown of costs by year is shown in Annex IV, Table 2.  The
production cost was fluctuating for budded stump ar.d budwood, while that of
the poly-bag budding rose steadily every year.  In most cases, the direct
costs alone were close to that of the private nurs,.ries.  the indirect cost
was responsible for the high production costs in t%e ORRAF nurseries.  The
high cost of budwood was due to high production and low consumption rate of
this material (para. 3.12) .
3.14     In any case the cost for poly-bag budding in 1986 was too high
because of high administrative cost amounting B 4.202/stump.
3.15     The consumption of bare-root budded stumps and poly-bag budding in
the five-year period was 24.977 million and 3.873 million points respectively.
The poly-bag buddings accounted for 15.5? of bare-root budded stump produc-
tion. This is about 13? below the project target. In view of the high cost
of poly-bag materials, this is a good performance reflecting their advantage
of a higher planting rate of success and more uniform and faster tree growth.
Summary of bare-root budded stump and poly-bag budding production (1982-86)
are shown in Annex IV, Table 3-4 respectively.
TraininR Prostrams
3.16     The training programs were expanded to me.t the project requirements.
UNDP sponsored both local and overseas training prdgrams (see details in
Clause 3.7.5 Training of UND'/FAO Technical Assistance). Improvement in the
training methodologies, selection of suitable courses, assessment and
evaluation focussing towards the development needs and problem solving for
better operation and standards of replanting were achieved.
3.17     Several courses for staff at different levels were organized.  They
were for management, supervision and training. Details of topics for training
courses, both the rubber replanters and ORRAF staff implemented during
1982-86, are given in Annex V, Table 1-2.

Publicity Campaign for Renlantins
3.18     The Development Division in ORRAF utilized mobile units for campaign-
ing to encourage farmers to apply for replanting and also to transfer tech-
nology for improvement of planting and field maintenance. Activities also
included field demonstration and training in the villages.
3.19     For the same purpose TV and radio programs on rubber replanting were
introduced at regular intervals in the following places.
Place             Channel                TimelFrequency
TV
Phuket                9                  30 minuteslmonthly
Songkhla             10                  25 minutes/two months
Surat Thani           8                   5 minutes/weekly
In addition, radio programs were arranged to broadcast news on rubber
technical and development activities covering replanting, involving 19 sta-
tions in all the 17 rubber producing provinces. Each broadcast was for 30
minutes weekly.
Local Consultants
3.20     Local consultants were engaged to assist ORRAF as the following
areas:
(a) reduction on ORRAF nursery establisbment; and
(b) improve staff productivity through streamlining by computerization of
the application and approval process for :eplanting.
3.21     ORRAF started to recruit the rubber specialist for the nurseries and
the computer consultant in April 1987 and September 1986 respectively. The
recruitment procedure followed that of the Ministry of Finance on Purchasing,
Contracting for Works and the Engagement of Consultants under projects financ-
ed by external loans B.E. 2527 (1984) through direct negotiation and selection
method respectively. A consialtant from Kasetsart University was selected for
the nursery consultancy and a consultant from the National Institute of
Development Administration was engaged for the consultancy on computerization.
The duration of service for both consultants was one-year.
UNDPIFAO Technical Assistance
3.22     The Project document THA/82/007 was signed in September/October 1982
with ORRAF and DOA/RRIT as the implementers and FAO the executing agency. The
RTG and UNDP inputs to the project are B 1,620,902,940 in kind and
US$1,098,520 in technical expertise, training and equipment respectively.

3.23     UNDP/FAO gave technical assista..e to support the Second Tree Crop
Project from November 1982 to April 1987 to improve the competency of ORRAF
and RRIT on administration, training, field operation and research and to
provide better quality rubber planting material, institutional linkages and
enhancement of Rubber Consultative Group's (RGG's) capabilities as an advisory
and monitoring body.
3.24     Foreien Consultants.  37.4 mms were utilized for the services of the
chief technical advisor, project coordinator and short-term consultants on
soils and fertilizers, plant breeding. cultural practices and economics and
planning. The remaining 2 mms in 1987 were for the visits of the project
coordinator and cultural practice consultant. Their reports were produced and
circulated with recommendations studied by the agencies concerned for applica-
tion.
3.25     National Consultants.  National Consultants were engaged for socio-
economic survey, manpower development, staff training, production of technical
manual and handouts, and radio and TV communications. Significant improve-
ments in the standard of work and quality of the product were observed. Four
thousand five hundred copies of the manual were produced.
3.26     Research and Development.  RRIT has greatly expanded its activities.
It has now three rubber research centers located in Songkhla, Surathani and
Chachoensao Provinces. In addition, three new rubber stations have been
established in Sanamchaiket in Chachoensao, Tung Pel in Chantaburi and Phon
Pisai in Nongkhai.  All three stations have research and development activi-
ties to promote and improve rubber growing in the astern and northeast
regions.
3.27     The project provided technical assistance in kind and expertise to
help improve the RRIT operations. Some innovations on cultural practices were
recommended for application. Assistance was also given on economic planning,
soils, plant breeding and nursery establishments.
3.28     Because of limited manpower and resources which were stretched to man
the new research centers and stations, RRIT had difficulty to keep up with the
demand for research support. Priorities will be set to direct research
activities on rubber replanting and new planting.
Trainin&
3.29     Both local and overseas training programs progressed well during the
project period. ORRA? trained 7,033 staff and 42,358 replanters on manage-
ment, operation, nurseries, planting and field maintenance. RRIT gave train-
ing to 1,416 officers and 35,393 farmers on budgrafting, tapping and specific
subjects requested by ORRAF, DOAE and other agencies. Four RRIT officers and
one ORRAF staff were sent abroad for post-graduate studies. The four RRIT
officers have returned with Master degrees on Soil Science, Plant Science,
Plant Physiology and Polymer Sc4^nce.  The fellow .rom ORRA? is doing a course
of Agricultural Economics in USis. Two other fellowships have been provided by
UNDP for the RRC Charchongsao to do post-graduate studies in Soil Science and
Agronomy; they all went abroad in August/September 1987. In addition, 45 RRIT
and 34 ORRA? officers went overseas for short-course training and study tours



during the project period. The project has benefi..ed much from the training
programs. There is now on adequate supply of skilied budders in the country.
Overseas training has raised the academic qualifications of four RRIT research
staff and increased the knowledge of those who went for short-courses and
study tours. Attention is now required to improve the training on tapping for
more skilled tappers and for the graduating replanters.
3.30     Equipment.  The project provided ORRAF with a computer terminal and
some office and audio-visual equipment. RRIT received an atomic absorption
spectrophotometer, a flame photometer with accessories and audio-visual equip-
ment. All items havz been put to good use to achieve better work output.
3.31     Institutional Linkages.  The project funded the participation of two
foreign consultants in the Rubber Ccmsultative Group (RCG) until 1985. Later,
additional budget was made available by UNDP for a Chinese consultant and four
non-government members in the 1986 and 1987 meetings. This change has made
RCG a more effective advisory and monitoring body to give practical guidance
for the improvement of the NR industry in Thailand.
3.32     Further Technical Recommendation.  UNDP assistance will continue
uider the Phase III Rubber Replanting Project (October 1986-September 1990) to
help ORRAP cope with the increasing responsibilities for replanting, mainten-
ance survey of rubber holdings in this forest reserve and the extension of two
year replanting period.
Other Loan Recipients
Horticultural Research Institute. Department of Agriculture (DOA)
3.33     Responsibilities.  This institute was responsible for implementing
two important sections of followst
(a)  Expansion and strer.gthening of the research capability of seed
gardens consisting of 450 rai (60 ha) at Kan Thuli Rubber Research
Station, Surathani Province; and
(b) Establishment of 100 rai of seed gardens at Trang Horticulture
Experiment Station.
3.34     Problems and Constraints.  The Project was expected to be completed
by March 31, 1986, but some construction was not completed and the Department
of Agriculture asked approval from IBRD to extend the Project to March 31,
1987.
3.35     Conclusion.  The project catalyzed the development of varieties,
cultural practices, and technology transfer of coconut in Southern Thailand.
It will also establish guidelines for further consideration.

Land Development Department
Imulementation Plan
3.36     The aim of this component was to undertake a land use survey of the
coconut growing areas in six provinces in the South of Thailand and to carry
out a study to assess the current situation in regard to land use data with a
view to preparing a proposal for a land use resurvey of the country. Achieve-
ment from the starting date until M4arch 1986. were as follows:
Chumporn Province                      470,000 rai
Nakorn Sri Thamarach Province          220,000 rai
Pattanee Province                      114,684 rai
Phuket Province                         30,597 rai
Songkla Province                        73,055 rai
Surat Thanee Province                  283,054 rai
Cost
3.37     The estimated cost this component was US$200,000 (B 4.6 million).
The actual cost was B 4.7 million (Annex 17).
Benefits
3.38     The land use and soil survey report and the map with scale of
1V - 50,000 of the coconut growing areas in six provinces in the South namely:
Chumporn, Narkon Sri Thamarat, Pattanee, Phuket, Songkhla and Surathani will
be utilized as the basic data for other agencies concerned for the purpose of
strengthening the coconut industry and ensuring appropriate agricultural land
use according to soil capability.                   f

(a) Objectives
The ma5n objectives of this component ares
ti) to strengthen the p1anning capability of OAE through technical
support and training.
(ii) to study the potential for tree crop development nationwide.
(b) Activities Accomolished
ti)  The socio-economic survey of coconut growers in Rhanom district,
Nakhon Sri Thamarat province.
(ii)  The socio-economic survey of the coconut growers in Punpin and
Muang districts, Surat Thani province.
(iii)  The economic study of intercropping in coconut orchard.



- 32 -
(iv) The study of coconut replanting sc1.eme.
Cv) The feasibility study of growing rubber in the North and North-
east.
(vi) A two-week stuly tour of six OAE staff for observing and study-
ing rubber planting in the People's Republic of China.
3.39     Copies of these reports have been submitted to the Bank.
(c) Problems
(i) We were unable to hire consultants to carry out special studies.
This was due to the fact that the selected consultant firm has pro-
posed a lot of changes in the contract as well as the personnel which
we have found unacceptable.
(ii) All other proposed study tours which we believed to be very useful
for the project were rejected by the Ministry of Finance.
(d) Costs
3.40     The estimated cost was B 10.7 million.  Tne actual cost was B 4.3
million (Table 1).
Proiect Cost
3.41     Annex VII. Table 1 gives comparative details of Appraisal Estimate 11
with Actual Project Cost. It can be observed that although 971 of new
replanting under agricultural, development target was achieved during FY82-85,
the actual cost is less than the appraisal estimate by B 2,208.310 million
especially for fertilizers, chemicals and planting materials. The main reason
is that the procurement cost of fertilizers and chsmicals was cheaper than the
estimate. But the actual labor cost was higher than the estimate by B 37.009
million because the actual ongoing area at 242,908 ha was higher than the
estimate of 212,000 ha by 30,908 ha. The total cost is lower than the esti-
mate by B 927.675 million.

USSI a B 23.00.
3.42     Administrative cost was less than the Appraisal estimate because of
restrictions on expenditures on civil works, purchase of land, vehicles and
equipment. Technical Assistance and Training costs were also lower than the
projection, amounting to B 10.225 million because most of the programs were
sponsored by UNDP. Salaries and operating cost exceeded the estimate by
3 32.887 million due to the fact that although the increase of new staff was
less than anticipated, the operating cost was higher than estimated.
3.43     However, the overall project cost for both is still lower than the
estimate, the reason being that the actual of the physical and price contin-
gencies are less than projection.
3.44     Details of comparison of estimated with actual project cost of all
implementing agencies is given in Table 2.
Cash Flow
3.45     A comparison of the Cash Flow compared with the estimate is given in
Annex VII, Table 2. The cess collected in FY85, 8 769 million was the highest
per year in the project period. The lowest cess income was FY82 amounting to
B 477,000 million. Since FY82, the cess income rose steadily every year until
it reached the peak in FY8S.
3.46     The rubber price in FY82 averaging B 14.00/kg which was the lowest in
project period was probably the main cause for the low demand in that year.
Since then, the rubber prices had remained steady maintaining around
B 16-17/kg between FY83-85. Actual rubber applied for exports, cess
collected, average cess rate and rubber price is shown in Annex VII, Tables
3-4.
3.47     The cess income for the project period (FY82-85) was B 2,521,000 mil-
lion while the appraisal estimate for the same period was B 4,957,000 million
showing a difference of B 2,436,000 million or 49Z lower. Obviously, the
appraisal estimate was unrealistically high.

3.48     Total income of ORRAF for the period was B 5,932 million while the
total expenditure including research cess paid to RRIT were B 5.b33 million
showing a balance of B 379,000 million. The under-expenditure was possible
because of (a) significant rubber production; (b) stable rubber price;
(c) restriction in expenditure on capital item; (d) no increase in the rate of
grant for replanting; (e) higher withdrawal percentages for several items.
3.49     Five percent of the cess averaging B 30 million p.a. (FY82-85) was
allocated for the administration cost of ORRAF while th' annual expenditure
for this item averaged about B 231 million. It is'prt.,wsed to amend the Act
so as to increase the rate to 10? to cover their cost. The proposal has
reached the Parliament for the decision. Cash Flow summary of FY60-86,
details of administrative cost and fund structure is given in Annex VII.
Tables 5-7 respectively.
Accounts and Audits
3.50     The accounts in ORRAP headquarters and the provincial office accounts
were computerized in the project period. By doing so, the accounting system
has improved with more speedy and efficient work output.
3.51     The audited accounts of ORRAF were submitted to the World Bank (WB)
regularly. Due to lengthy clearance procedures at the Office of the Auditor
General, the submission of such accounts were usually late. Becav-e of the
delay, RTG requested an extension for submission of audited account from 6 to
9 months after the enfd of each fiscal year beginning from FY86. The WB agreed
to the extension.
Procurement
3.52     The main items of procurement were fertilizers and chemicals.  Both
local and international competitive bidding (LCB and ICB) for purchase of
fertilizers and chemicals went well between FY82-84. In FY85-86 disagreement
occurred on some items on the bidding documents. This resulted in ORRAF
having to purchase fertilizers separately on four occasionss three times
through LCB, and once through ICB. Buying the fertilizers in small quantities
separately led to higher cost for the goods. This involved additional admin-
istrative time and labor which could have been avoided had the purchase been
made at one time. Details of purchase are shown in Annex VI.
Disbursement
3.53     Annex VIII shows the schedule of Bank disbursements compared with the
actual. The initial disbursement delay was caused by a five-month delay in
loan effectiveness which was due to ORRAP's financial crisis as explained in
Annex II, Table 2--Delay of Loan Effectiveness. T-he actual disbursements for
most items in the project period were higher than _he estimates as the incre-
ments in withdrawal percentages were made to offset the total project deficit.
The final withdrawal was effected in October 1986 from the WB and in September
1986 from CDC. The closing date for the loan was September 1986.

4.1      The graduated replant plots are classified according to two mainten-
ance categories, *the good* and "the poors. Sixty percent of the total gradu-
ated area is well maintained and the remainder is poorly maintained.
4.2      In the well maintained plots, it is assumed that the trees come into
tapping at 7.5 years from the start of land clearing (when the trees are 6.5
years old), while in the poorly maintained plots, tapping would start six
months latei, after the end of grant year 8.
4.3      The two categories gave very different yield profiles.  Based on
surveys of the Rubber Research Institute, it is assumed that yields on the
'goods plots would peak at an average of 1,860 kg/ha/year for tapping and
average 1,350 kg/ha/year over a 20 year tapping life. Tn contrast yields of
the 'poor' plots would peak at about 1,560 kg/ha in years 6/7 and then decline
steadily to uneconomic levels (less than 400 kglha/year) after a total or 17
tapping years, for an average annual yield of about 1,050 kg/ha.
4.4      Yields and total production estimates for the project are set notably
higher than at appraisal due to a wide variation in the clone mix between the
assumptions at appraisal and the actual areas of the different clones planted.
These changes reflected changing recommendations and strongly focussed demands
of the growers. In particular, the use of clone RIM 600, one of the highest
yielding and proven clones available, extends over about 75Z of the total
planted project area compared to less than 102 share assumed at appraisal.
Clone GTI on the other hand, which has a normal yield profile about 252 lower
than RRIN 600, was used over only 22 or the area compared to 302 targeted at
appraisal. This change has important implications for the total estimates of
incremental production of the project.
4.5      Incremental production directly derived from 235,955 ha of new
replanting under the project during 1982-86 would total 4,088.2 thousand tons.
This assumes a without project case where new :eolanting would occur --rer a
10-year period on 10W of the area, and that 10 years of continued senile rub-
ber production would occur on the remaining area. The project production
increment is expected to peak at about 374.1 thousand tons per annum by 1997.
Details are in Annex I=, Table 1-2.
Marketing and Prices
Marketina
4.6      Rubber production was marketed along the usual lines with most of
farmers selling air-dried sheets to local traders or through group marketing
organizations.
4.7      The main market for Thai rubber will continue to be Japan, and the
majority of rubber exported is expected to be grade 3 ribbed smoked sheet.
Details are in Annex IX, Tables 3-S.



- 3R _
Prices
4.8      Financial prices are estimated on the basis of the January 1987 Wo;ld
Bank projections for World rubber prices adjusted for international freight,
the domestic cost of marketing and the present level of taxation of rubber.
The average farmgate rubber price is based on the assumption that 802 of out-
put would be unsmoked sheet of RSS 3 quality and 20S would be scrap. Estimat-
ed financial and economic prices for rubber are summarized in Table 3.
V. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
Plannini/Monitorina and Evaluation Undertaken
5.1      During the project period the important outputs conducted by the
Planning and Monitoring Center concerning planning/monitoring and evaluation
were:
(a) Assisting in the commencement of data gathering on second round
replanters and improvement of the application form by the Replanting
Division in response to PMC's recommendation based on the results of
socio-economic survey of both replanters and second round replanters.
The result indicates that the average tapping years of early second
round replanters was only 14.6 years. It should be noted, however,
that the sample as explicitly biased to focus only on early second
round replanters.
(b)  EvAluation of the change of fertilizer rate of application.  An addi-
tion of 100 gm/tree/round of application was practiced starting from
the fifth installment. The survey result in terms of girth increment
is quite satisfactory. Unfortunately, the rate was not changed in
order to follow the recommendation of RRIT.
(c) Evaluation of graduated replant-plots quality using girth at per-
centile 70th as an indicator.
Fifteen years ago, a study on girth of replanted rubber was carried
out by the Replanting Verification Section. This study was duplicat-
ed on the six-year old rubber trees. Bigger girth was found. These
findings will be used in the estimation of yield and production in
such a way that the commencement of tappable trees can be reasonably
projected.
(d)   Giving assistance to personnel in the Training Section in the evalu-
ation of training activities for replanters.
(e) Acting as coordinator between MOAC and ORRA? provincial offices in
planning and monitoring activities for the national Rural Development
Program Committee presided over by the prime minister.
(f) Participating in the preparation of Corporate Plan.

Socio-Economic Survey
5.2      The aim of the first survey was to determine the total subsistence
requirements for replanters until the rubber came into full production and the
minimum size of holding that would cover this expenditure. The survey showed
the total subsistence expenditure amounted to B 23,606 per annum and that a
plot of not less than 1.28 ha was necessary to cover this expenditure. The
result of this survey leads to the formulation of the "Needy Rubber Small-
holder Development Prog.am' (see Annex X).          A
5.3      Another socio-economic survey of participants in the Coconut Replant-
ing Pilot Project. The results indicate that the amount of grant is, to a
certain extent, inadequate for at least 31Z of coconut replanters.
Quarterly and Annual Progress Reports
5.4      During this Second Project, the Loan Project Unit was responsible for
gathering the data and comments concerned from all divisions. However, in
Phase III, analysis will also be by done the Planning and Monitoring Center.
VI. ECONOMIC AND FTNANCI   EVALUATION
Benefits and Beneficiaries
6.1      In the Staff Appraisal Report dated November 30, 1981, the expected
benefits were:
Ca) Average yields of 1,022 kg/ha/tapping year;
sb) Incremental replanting on 200,000 ha and total incremental production
of 3,119,000 tons, worth some B 115 billion;
(c) Beneficiaries consisting of 166,000 families of small farmers with
less than 3.2 ha (20 rai) of land and an average of 1.2 ha of
replanted area, and some 44,000 families of farm laborers; and
(d) A weighted average of farm net cash flow of -B 3,894 ha/year for
years 1-8, and B 22,609 ha yea. for years,10-20.
In comparison with the above-mentioned targets, the project achievements at
project completion are:
(a) Average yields of 1,260 kg/ha/tapping yea: (232 increase due to dif-
ferent clone mix described in section 4.1,above);
(b) Incremental replanting on 235,955 ha (an 182 increase) and total
incremental production if 4,088 tons (the 312 increase resulting from
both higher yields and larger area), worth some B 75 billion (the
172 decrease resulting from significantly lower projected rubber
prices);

years 1-8, and B 15,021 ha/year for years 10-20 (decrease due mainly
to lower rubber prices).
Comparison of Appraisal and Completion projections is summarized in Table 4.
Rate of Return
6.2      The economic rate of return is estimated at completion to be 14.62
for the rubber replanting component, virtually the same as the 15.32 ERR est.-
mated at appraisal. Higher rubber yield and lower fertilizer and lower labor
unit prices were more than offset by lower rubber prices, and to a lesser
extent by a higher quantity of labor inputs. The ERR is calculated on the
basis of comparing, economic prices, forecast agricultural production and its
associated benefits and costs directly attributable to project investment and
a *without project situatio., under which it is assumed that ORRAP would take
on no new commitments after the end of 1981.
6.3      Projections of yield and input requirements are made on the basis of
present level of technology. This is equivalent to the assumption that any
changes in cost/benefits due to non-project factors would be the same in both
with and without project cases. Economic prices are calculated on the basis
of financial prices adjusted for taxes and subsidies. In line with the World
Bank Commodities Division forecasts, the prices of fertilizer and rubber are
projected to increase over time. Details of the derivation of economic
prices, cost and benefit streams are described in Annex XII.
6.4      Net Present Value calculated on the basis of the Opportunity Cost of
Capital of 122 is B 2.109 million.
VII. SPECIAL ISSUES
Rubber Holding in the National Forest Reserve Area
7.1      458,000 21 ha of rubber holdings are in the National Forest Reserve
Area. This accounted for about 302 o' the total rubber area in Thailand. All
these holdings do not have evidence of land ownership to be able to partici-
pate in the rubber replanting scheme. During the second loan period, agree-
ment was reached with the Forestry Department to lease the land to the holders
so that they can be eligible for replanting in the ORRAF scheme. ORRAP will
have to survey all the plots to help expedite application and approval of land
lease. This is an important activity which will require early action to
ensure that the replanting target can be achieved.

Undersized Tapuina and Over Exploitation of Rubber Trees
7.2      The problems of undersized tapping and over-exploitation of rubber
trees leading to early application for second round replanting were caused by
the replanters not having the technical know-how about the tapping system.
However, this problem began to decline in importance the latter part of the
project after the Natural Rubber Policy Committee distributed the training
responsibilities to the three organizations in the following manner:



- 43 -
(a) ORRAF undertakes training in all the subjects in the replanting
period when the rubber trees are tmmature;
(b) RRIT trains the trainers from ORRAF and DOAE as well as skill
development, e.g. budgrafting and tapping; and
(c) DOAE trains the graduating replanters on tapping, tapping systems,
rubber sheet processing, marketing and maintenance of mature rubber.
Changes in Fertilizer Formulae
7.3      Following the recommendation of DOA, the fertilizer formulae were
changed to produce concentrated fertilizers. Only two fertilizer formulae
were revised. These two are as followst
Type        Old formulae         New formulae
1            11-6-4                18-10-6
3            10-5-9                16-8-14
7.4      With higher concentration fertilizers, the quantities for two types
of fertilizers were reduced resulting is a saving in handling and transporta-
tion costs.
7.5      (Details of new rates of fertilizers and grants tables are given in
Annex XV, Tables 1-2).
Change in the Use of DalaDon to Glvohosate Herbicide
7.6      To reduce costs, ORRAP decided to procure  Glyphosate Herbicide,
instead of the more expensive "Dalaponw since Glyphosate was as effective as
Dalapon in ki'.ling weeds and lalang. Procurement was by ICB. In the first
year after the change ORRA? saved B 1.5 million.
VIII. CONCLUSION
8.1      The achievements of Second Phase were as good as, if not better than
the first project. The total area replanted was 235,955 ha against the four
year project target of 200,000 ha. The number of rubber holdings
participating and benefitting and from this project was 130,512.
8.2      The supplies of rubber planting materials were sufficient for the
project requirements. ORRAF encouraged farmers to produce their own materials
and supported the farmers to establish their own nurseries. Private nurseries
produced cheaper budded stumps and polybag budding but the quality was not as
good as those from ORRA? nurseries. Because of overhead charges and stricter
control, the production cost in the ORRAF nurseries was higher. The need to
impose controls in the private nurseries for supplies of better quality mate-
rials has been emphasized.



- 44 -
8.3      The financial situation of ORRAF was bad at an early stage when cess
income and rubber prices were low. At the same time the fund for the adminis-
tration cost was insufficient resulting in the need for obtaining a supplemen-
tary loan from CDC. The situation improved towards the end of the project and
the overall expenditure of the project did not exceed the income.
8.4      The allocation of 52 of the cess for the administrative cost of ORRAF
is inadequate. A proposal to raise the rate to 1OZ was approved by the Par-
liament effective Decembex. 29, 1987. The ORRAF Act was also amended to estab-
lish a flat rate of cess per kg of rubber export to provide greater stability
for the Replanting Fund.

Changes in manpower structure and five year (1982-1986) manpower
work plan
Due to the recent development, the 1982-1986 manpower plan has
to be modified and improved. The consultant produced a revised version in
It80 with recommendations for a new panpower development plan for 1987-1989.
The adoption of these recoz=endations will be advantages to ORRAF.
-     In the meantime, it is proposed to evaluate manpowere
utilization annually to determine ibethtror not the human resources have
been put to good use in ORRAF. Such action will lead to work efficientey
and keep the administration cost to the minimum.

Amendment to ICB Bidding Document
A problem on fertilizer procurement arose io Fy 1985 which
continued into 7" 1986-1987 over the procedures set between the Bank Guideline
and 1OF Reguiations/Ferttlizer Act BEL 2518. Discussion on the matter was held
between the WB mission and NOFlimplementlzg agencies but the final decision
has not been made yet) Another round of discussion on the matter will be
held In Chiengmai lr. July 1987. The problem will have to be  resolve soon ot
otherwise it will further delay the fertilizer procurement through ICB and
will seriously affect the Third Rubber Replanting Project.

During the project period, 3 surveys were carried out by PIC.
HetiuoI.gy and resut are a
(1) The first urvey in 1983 aiued at the basic data on socio-
economic status of the rubber plantatiou owmers In crop year 1982/83. They
were Classified according to the replanting status into 3 groups the mt-
relanters. the ongping repLanters and the terminated replanters. Aiother
objctve of this survey was to asess both the eonomic and financial
lmpact of repLanting with ORaM. Samples of rubber plantation owner
ttotlling to 1058 inL 17 provinces wre interviewed. The sampling technique
aplied was "Stratified 2W-Stage sampling" Financial sum ort and technical
assistance were both obtained fxom MDP and the National institute of
Dovelopmt ad Administration (NDA).
Prom this survey a subsistent-line has been drawn up from the
most necessary expenditres amunt to.a per annum value of 23,606 baht/
household. This aucunt wiuld be cowaensated by the inoosms from   1.28 ha
of tappable terminated rubber replant-plot.
(2) The second survey in 1984 was a specific one. Its target group
was the early seoond round replanters. The main objectives of this survey
were to determine the agricultural practices in rubber farming and thelr aocin-
economic status in order to find out the real causes of the incidence of early
seoond round replanting. nakornsrithammarat province t where the highest
second round replanting prevailed (443 applic-nts out of 732 for the whole
country) : was selected as the representative area . Simple Random sampling
techinque was used. Eighty two second round replanters were interviewed by
officers from PMC. Data revealed that 78 0 of the first replanted their
rubber in 1963 and another 17 0 in 1964. Seedlings ranked first among the
two types of planting materials used which was anount to 68.2 0 of the
replanters. Only 18.4 * planted with budded stumps. Tjirl was the cost
favourite clones and occupied 87 0 of replant acerage where the share of
PBS/S1 was only 5 0.Manuring of rubber trees in tapping to a small extent
was practiced by only 13.4 * of rubber plantation owners. The remainders
applied no fertiliser at all.  The per-hectare yield prior to applying for
grant was 780 kg. per annum (124.8 kg/rai). Tapping system was irregular.
Average tapping period was only 14.6 years.  Thirtynine percents of the
applicants used to apply stimulant for 4.8 months before felling of rubber
trees. These statistic will serve to indicate the magnitude of the problem
that ORaF and other agencies concerned are facing.                                          U

Dear Sir,
Reference is made to your letter dated Auugust 2, 1989
In which you have attached the project Completion Report (PCR) on
the Second Tree Crops Project (Loan 2078-TH)o We would like inform
that in line 10 of no. 15, on page 5 of PCR, concerning the reasor.
of requesting ORRAF to continue providing technical advice for an
additional two years, should be modified to " the premature tapping
is still practiced by some graduated replanters"
We would be greatful if you could reconsider of this
modification. Your kind cooperation is, as always, appreciated,
With best regards.
Sincerely yours,
