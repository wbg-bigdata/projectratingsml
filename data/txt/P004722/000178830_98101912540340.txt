1. BACKGROUND
A. Project Background
1.01      The Royal Thai Government has requested a second Bank loan to
assist the Office of the Rubber Replanting Aid Fund Board (ORRAF) in
financing its accelerated rubber replanting program and in initiating a
program of pubLic support of rubber new planting. ORRAF has proven to be an
effective and efficient organization, capable of implementing annual large-
scale rubber replanting programs under the Bank-financed Rubber Replanting
Project (Loan 1243-TH). ORRAF will now also assume on a pilot basis
responsibility for the provision of technical support services during the
establishment and immature period to farmers undertaking rubber new planting.
1.02      The main objectives of the proposed project would be:  (a) to
increase, or at least maintain, the income level of smallholders living on
relatively poor soils in rainfed areas by expanding rubber production;
(b) to help improve the country's balance of payments by increasing rubber
exports; and (c) to provide a basis for further development of the tree crop
subsector nationwide.
1.03      Project components include:  (a) a four-year time slice of ORRAF's
entire program, including new rubber replanting starts, at a rate of about
50,000 ha p.a. (totaling 200,000 ha), continuation and completion of replant-
ings already started (212,000 ha), provision of technical support to a pilot
scheme for rubber new planting, and the cost of ORRAF-s infrastructure and
administration; (b) expansion of rubber research and enhancement of the
research capability in the Rubber Research Center (RRC); (c) establishment
of 60 ha of coconut seed gardens; (d) a land use survey of coconut-growing
areas in six provinces; (e) a study of the potential for tree crop develop-
ment nationwide; and (f) strengthening the institutional capabilities of
ORRAF and the Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE) through technical
support and training. Total project cost over the four-year project period
is estimated at about $359 million of which $142 million would be provided
as a Bank loan, and E 10 million as a loan from the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC, UK).
1.04      The proposed project was prepared by ORRAF assisted by an FAO/UNDP
technical assistance team and Bank preparation missions.
B. The Agricultural Sector
1.05      Out of Thailand-s population of 45 million, about 35 million live in
rural areas and earn their livelihood primarily in agriculture. Despite rapid
structural change elsewhere in the Thai economy, the agricultural sector is
dominant and will remain so for many years to come. At present it employs



-2-
about 75% of the labor force, produces about 30% of Gross Domestic Product,
and provides about 60% of total export earnings. The overall growth of the
sector has been excellent, averaging about 5.0% p.a. in the period 1960-79.
This has come largely from an expansion of the area under cultivation (about
4% p.a. until the mid-1970s) along with a movement into higher valued crops.
1.06      The evidence now indicates that the availability of readily acces-
sible new land for expanding agriculture has been nearly exhausted. This has
led to a further encroachment on forest reserves and on land only marginally
suitable for stable agriculture. It is estimated that the forest area has
been declining at a rate of 8.5% p.a. (a decrease from 50% of the total land
area in 1963 to 25% in 1977).
1.07      Land use has been intensified, primarily due to diversification into
higher valued crops. In irrigated parts of the central plain and in some
other areas, intensification of land use is taking place principally through
the use of higher yielding varieties of rice and maize, complemented (in the
case of rice) with higher usage of technical inputs such as fertilizer and
pesticides. In rubber growing areas, similar changes leading to greater pro-
ductivity are occurring. Some yields (kenaf, cassava, and for a time sugar-
cane), however, have actually declined, presumably through planting on margi-
nal lands. In part of the rainfed areas, a poor natural resource base is a
serious constraint to increased agricultural production (excluding tree crops)
and continued improvement in incomes.
1.08      One of the most striking features of the sector's development has
been the rapidity with which certain crops have grown in importance. The area
planted to maize, cassava, and sugarcane is now just under 3 million ha
and has tripled in the last decade. This has been largely achieved through an
expansion of the rainfed cultivated area (and not at the expense of
traditional crops). In the 1979/80 season rice was planted on over 60% of the
cultivated area, rubber on 10%, maize and cassava each about 8%, and sugarcane
5%. Within this overall expansion a second characteristic can be perceived:
areas planted with some of the newer crops have temporarily declined while
others increased as a result of switches among crops. This reflects the
responsiveness of Thai farmers to the signals of market prices, and indicates
the leading role of the private sector in maintaining the dynamism of
agriculture. A third source of variation is the weather, since the rainfall
can influence the output of the sector by as much as 20% in any given year.
1.09      Altogether, about 4.5 million farm families occupy about 24
million ha. Ninety percent of the cultivated area is rainfed and only 10%
irrigated. Farm sizes are necessarily small, but the size distribution is
not particularly skewed. Estimates made in 1974 by the OAE in the Ministry
of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) give a modal farm size of 3.6 ha and a
mean size of about 5.5 ha. Almost 90% of farm families are self-employed, and
three quarters of the farms are worked by owner-occupiers rather than tenants.
Despite the comparatively good distribution and utilization of land in



- 3 -
Thailand, population pressure is leading to the cultivation of poorer lands.
Off-farm incomes appear to have contributed greatly to the household incomes
of small farmers and farmers on marginal lands, including those in the
relatively poor Northeast.
1.10      The benefits of growth have been relatively well distributed
throughout the country. Since most agricultural production is by small-
holders, most of the income growth in that sector has accrued to the rural
producers themselves. The overall incidence of poverty has been reduced from
about 57% in the early 1960s to about 31% by the mid-1970s, and from about 61%
to 35% in the rural areas.
C. Government Agricultural Policy
Objectives
1.11      The main objectives of the Government's agricultural policy are:
(a) to increase agricultural production as rapidly as possible; (b) to
alleviate rural poverty and to redress inter-regional income disparities; (c)
to expand agricultural exports rapidly so as to help the balance of payments;
and (d) to better utilize the available land suitable for agriculture.
These objectives are to be pursued subject to the constraint that forest and
other natural resources are to be protected and the degradation of the natural
environment minimized.
Strategies
1.12      The Government's efforts to pursue the above objectives involve
the following major strategies: the creation of an environment in which
the private sector will have the needed incentives and confidence to boost
production and exports; the development of public sector infrastructure
and services to facilitate the achievement of sector objectives; demarcation
of 236 poverty districts in which line agencies are to focus their programs;
and the establishment of the required legal and regulatory framework to give
individual farmers title to their land and a clear demarcation of zones
reserved for forestry and conservation.
Bank Lending Strategy
1.13      The Bank fully supports the broad outline of the Government's
objectives and strategies, and the proposed project is designed to meet these
objectives by increasing the production of rubber. The Bank's agricultural
lending program has two underlying aims:  to improve the technical and
infrastructural bases for improving productivity, and to increase the Govern-
ment's overall capacity for project planning, coordination and implementation.
Where possible, projects are oriented toward meeting the needs of poor people
and communities. The main activities supported by the Bank in agriculture
are:



-4-
(a) Irrigation. Since 1950, Bank assistance to Thailand's water
resource development has included financing for five multipurpose
dams and twelve irrigation projects for a total of $683 million.
Of the irrigation projects, six were in the central Chao Phya Basin,
two in the Northeast, one in the South and three in the Mae Klong
Basin.
(b) Tree Crops. The replanting and new planting of tree crops (rubber
and oil palm) is being expanded. This is improving agricultural
production and export earnings, as well as raising farmers incomes.
The proposed project is the second phase of a long-term program to
support the tree crop subsector.
(c) Research. Research programs are being supported which emphasize:
the production of high-yielding and pest- and disease-resistant
varieties of the main crops; adaptive research aimed at improving
rainfed rice and other rainfed crop yields; and research into
alternative farming systems, including crop diversification,
intercropping and rotational cropping, which should also benefit
rainfed rice farmers.
(d) Land Development. Current land development activities are focused
on the conversion of shifting cultivation areas to a condition of
stable agriculture and introduction of appropriate soil and water
conservation works and practices.
(e) Extension. As the training and visit system of extension achieves
national coverage, every effort is being made to ensure that it
reaches poor rural communities and that the service is supported
by the wider availability of agricultural inputs.
(f) Credit. Credit arrangements are being improved by strengthening
credit institutions such as the Bank for Agriculture and Agricul-
tural Cooperatives (BAAC) and the cooperatives and agencies
supervising the cooperative system. More funds are being made
available for medium- and long-term institutional lending, and
credit arrangements are being integrated with other support
services.
(g) Rural Infrastructure. Rural infrastructure (including roads)
and services are being strengthened through several Bank projects.

1.14      Two Project Completion Reports have been prepared, one for the
Sirikit Dam (Ln. 514-TH) and one for the Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement
Project (Cr. 379-TH). These two projects were the subjects of a joint Proj-
ect Performance Audit Report. The Sirikit Dam Project was very successful,
made a major contribution to the rapid expansion of dry season cropping in
the Chao Phya Basin and was a timely addition to the country's power
production. The Chao Phya project was also successfuly completed and has
provided valuable experience to the Government in the planning, design and
implementation of an intensive mode of on-farm development. It was found,
during implementation of the Chao Phya project, that operation and
maintenance (O&M) of both the main and farm level systems required some
improvements and, under more recent projects, steps have been taken to
strengthen the O&M capablity of the Royal Irrigation Department (RID),
mainly through provision for consulting services to assist RID to develop
O&M procedures in these project areas.
1.15      The Bank-supported program can help the Government achieve its
objective of maintaining agricultural growth, although to improve produc-
tivity, Government's agricultural commodity price policies must provide an
adequate incentive for producers to adopt improved technology, which is
heavily dependent on the use of fertilizers. As part of its preparation of
the Fifth Economic and Social Development Plan, the Government has carried
out an agricultural pricing and marketing study which reviews, inter alia,
the relationship between taxes on rice exports and the supply and price of
fertilizers with a view toward improving the incentive structure. The
lack of title for about 40% of agricultural holdings, which is another
serious deterrent to private investment, is also the subject of Government
review.
2. ORRAF AND THE TREE CROP SUBSECTOR
A. Background
2.01      Tree crops, including rubber, coconut, coffee, cocoa, oil palm and
fruit trees, now account for at least 15% of the planted area in Thailand.
Table 2.1 shows the planted areas, value of production and value of exports of
the major tree crops, and highlights the fact that rubber and coconut
dominate the subsector. Both of these are smallholder crops and are grown on
relatively poor, rainfed soils. Consequently, they play an indispensable role
in alleviating poverty in the areas where they are grown.

2.02      Rubber.  As the table indicates, rubber is by far the single most
important tree crop, at present growing mainly in South and Southeast
Thailand, but with potential for expansion into the relatively poor North-
east. It is predominantly a smallholder crop and at present it contributes to
about 12% of the country's total foreign exchange earnings. Over the past two
decades, rubber production has been increasing at about 6% p.a., partly as a
result of a successful rubber investment fund administered through ORRAF, a
rubber replanting fund established in 1960. ORRAF administers rubber
replanting grants to smallholders from funds it receives through a general
cess levied on rubber exports. These grants are provided both in kind
(high-yielding clonal plant material and required inputs such as fertilizers
and agrochemicals) and in cash (after satisfactory completion of specified
tasks) over about six years of the immaturity period of the rubber (paras.
2.15-2.16). During the period 1960-80, about 340,000 ha (or 21% of the
total rubber area) of old seedling rubber was replanted with high-yielding
clonal plant material under the auspices of ORRAF, but over 420,000 ha of the
present rubber area is still planted with overaged and low-yielding trees
which are due for replanting. Details of rubber cultivation are given in
Annex 1.

2.03      ORRAF is also responsible for providing technical services to
smallholders during the immature period of the replanted rubber (about six
years) after which the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) takes over.
The private sector satisfactorily handles all the processing and marketing
requirements, while all rubber research is carried out by the Rubber Division
in the Department of Agriculture (DOA) through its RRC. The RRC is currently
in need of a greater number of qualified research officers.
2.04      Scope exists for increased rubber new plantings, and smallholders
have shown marked interest in this development. Government has already
begun to explore the possibilities for expanding rubber production into the
Eastern, Northeastern and Northern Regions and has decided to initiate a
pilot scheme for rubber new planting, with BAAC providing credit and ORRAF
giving technical support. The financial, technical and institutional
implications of this development need to be further studied and the pilot
scheme assessed.
Coconut
2.05      Coconut is the second most important tree crop in Thailand
(440,000 ha). Extensive coconut plantings (mainly monoculture) are confined
to the South, where they account for about 180,000 ha; only about 10-20% of
this area is estimated to be suitable for intercropping with coffee and cocoa.
Elsewhere coconut is found on houselots and on bunds around rice fields. In
the South, an estimated 90,000 ha are due for replanting and about 65,000 ha
may be suitable for rehabilitation through the use of inputs and/or inter-
cropping with coffee or cocoa. To establish the areas for replanting, rehabi-
litation (monoculture or intercropped) and new planting, a land-use survey
on the basis of existing aerial photographs of the main coconut-growing
areas in the South is required. At present the production and yields of
coconut are low, mainly due to the use of unselected plant material and
lack of adequate inputs and maintenance standards. About 885 million nuts
p.a. are produced and are mainly sold as fresh nuts in the local markets.
Only the small nuts are converted into copra for local oil milling, but
because of the general shortage of nuts, Thailand has been importing an
increasing amount of edible oils. The present nut supply is substantially
short of demand, estimated at 850 million for the fresh nut market and 120
million nuts for industrial processing, resulting in a shortfall of about
85 million nuts p.a./l As this situation is expected to worsen, there is
considerable scope for a major replanting or new planting program using
hybrid plant material and the required inputs. To permit such development
/1 One nut is equivalent to about 0.18 kg of copra.



the Government has decided to finance coconut planting on a pilot basis
through a credit scheme administered by BAAC. However, institutional
responsibility for technical support and coordination of services among the
various agencies for a program of coconut development needs to be clarified.
This would be studied under the proposed project, which also includes the
required land-use survey and staff training in coconut cultivation.

2.06      Oil palm covers an area of about 12,000 ha in the South in three
land settlement schemes, of which 5,000 ha are due for replanting and 7,000 ha
could be rehabilitated. In 1979, the private sector started an extensive oil
palm planting program, but particulars of the program are as yet unknown to
the Bank. It is projected that by 1985 domestic production of palm oil
could satisfy demand, so that any further major expansion of oil palm
growing in Thailand would be destined for the export market. Under the
Bank's Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1816-TH) the status of oil palm
development in three land settlement schemes in the South developed by the
Cooperative Promotion Department will be reviewed, and a modest
rehabilitation program initiated, with BAAC providing long-term credit for
the establishment of 350 ha of oil palm by about 220 settlers. Prospects
for oil palm development in Thailand and the most suitable way of organizing
this development, should it prove economic, would also be addressed under
the review.
Coffee, Cocoa, Fruit Trees
2.07      Plantings of other tree crops such as coffee, cocoa and fruit trees
are widely scattered. Some coffee and, to a lesser extent, cocoa are found
intercropped with coconut. The proposed training of staff in coconut
cultivation (para. 2.05) would also cover coffee and cocoa as intercrops
of coconut, and the land-use survey to be carried out for the main coconut
growing provinces in the South would permit the areas suitable for
intercropping with coffee or cocoa to be delineated. It is reasonable to
expect that BAAC would provide credit for such development as for rubber new
planting and coconut and that the agency providing technical support for the
main crop, coconut, would also be responsible for providing technical
support for the intercrops.
2.08      Fruit trees are mainly grown on houselots and in orchards in
selected areas. Despite the suitability of South Thailand for the cultivation
of many tropical fruits, commercial development has failed to take place on
any significant scale. Due to the large proportion of small-scale producers
and the scattered location of fruit tree plantings, the scope for direct
Government involvement seems limited to extension services provided by the



- 9 -
DAE and improved research and provision of selected plant material carried out
by the DOA. BAAC should also investigate ways of providing long-term credit
to smallholders for fruit tree cultivation.
B. Institutional Arrangements
2.09      Planning for the tree crop subsector is carried out by the Office
of Agricultural Economics (OAE) in the MOAC; however, except in the case of
rubber replanting, the institutional arrangements and coordination of services
have not proved adequate to stimulate the potential development of the
subsector.
2.10      The institutions currently involved in the subsector provide a
variety of services. Research and the production of foundation stock for all
tree crops are the resDonsibilitv of DOA. Nurseries to provide Dlantina
material to farmers are the responsibility of DOA, which may delegate
authority to provide this service to the agency responsible for assisting
farmers establish the crop. ORRAF, for example, handles nearly all the
nurseries for rubber replanting.  The provision of regular extension services
during the productive years of the trees is the responsibility of DAE. Credit
is supplied either by BAAC or private banks. The provision of inputs is
either through normal commercial channels, or if economies in purchasing in
bulk are appreciable, then the agency charged with responsibility for
assisting farmers establish the crop can handle it. ORRAF performs this
function effectively in the case of rubber replanting. Marketing and
processing are carried out effectively and efficiently by the private sector
in Thailand.
2.11      Except for rubber replanting, there are currently no lead agencies
responsible for providing technical support to farmers for the establishment
of the various tree crops and during the immature period when the needs are
greatest. Recognizing this problem, Government intends to carry out a rubber
new planting pilot scheme (para. 2.04), with ORRAF's excellent cadre of
experienced staff providing technical support to farmers during the establish-
ment and immature phases of the crop. This will, of course, require close
collaboration with BAAC, which would provide the credit, and with the DOA and
DAE.
2.12      A program to accelerate coconut development by smallholders is also
being developed in Thailand. Credit would be supplied by BAAC, but the
institution responsible for providing technical support to farmers during
the crop-s establishment and immature period has not been selected. ORRAF
would be the obvious candidate for the following reasons:



- 10 -
(a) it is already officially responsible for giving technical
advice on coconut cultivation to rubber growers replanting with
coconut, and under the proposed project, ORRAF's capacity
to provide this assistance would be strengthened through staff
training;
(b) it has an organizational infrastructure already in place to provide
a similar technical service to smallholders for rubber replanting;
(c) in the absence of an existing alternative institution, there would
clearly be economies in expanding ORRAF to also provide similar
technical support to coconut producers; and
(d) institutional cooperation would be easier for BAAC if it had only
to deal with ORRAF for both rubber new planting and coconuts.
Institutions
2.13      ORRAF.  Since its establishment in 1960, ORRAF has evolved into one
of the most effective and efficient public sector institutions in Thailand.
Details of ORRAF-s organization and financial position are given in Annex 2.
Its main activity has been providing and administering rubber replanting
grants and technical assistance for rubber replanters, financed from the
Rubber Replanting Aid Fund. ORRAF administers this Fund which receives its
monies through a general cess levied on rubber exports supplemented, when
necessary, by Government subventions. Although the Government Act containing
ORRAF-s basic legal and organizational structure authorizes it to undertake
"the implementation of rubber or perennial tree replantings," ORRAF-s
involvement in the development of other tree crops has thus far been limited,
largely due to lack of technical knowledge, the limited availability of high
quality planting materials, and insufficient demand from smallholders, as the
grant allocation for other tree crops is much smaller than that for rubber.
2.14      To date, the basic objective of ORRAF has been to undertake rubber
replanting in order to replace overaged rubber trees throughout Thailand. To
this end, it uses 90% of the proceeds of the cess levied on rubber exports to
finance the cost of rubber replanting in the form of grants to individual
replanters./l By law, ORRAF must strive to allocate annually about 70% of its
available funds to smallholders, which are legally defined as having holdings
of up to 8 ha each.
/1 According to Section 18 of the ORRAF Act, 5% must be allocated to the
RRC, up to 5% can be used for ORRAF-s administrative expenses, and
90% is returned to the farmers as grants for replanting.



- 11 -
2.15      The rubber replanting grant has two purposes:  providing sufficient
materials (mainly high-yielding plant material and fertilizer) to gain the
full benefits of improved rubber technology.; and contributing to the
subsistence of farmers during the period of maturation (about the first
seven years) by partial financing of labor costs. Accordingly, the grant
consists of cash payments as well as material components which are delivered
to the farmer in kind. Both are released by ORRAF's provincial offices to
replanters in seven installments over a period of about six years, with each
installment conditional upon satisfactory completion of specified tasks
certified by an ORRAF inspector. ORRAF's system of providing grants to
smallholders is well organized and efficient, and has adequate safeguards
against abuse.
2.16      The amount of the grant is determined by the ORRAF Board.  In an
effort to keep up with rising costs, ORRAF has raised the grant from $470/ha
in 1962 to $580/ha (1965-66); $625/ha (1967-75); $875/ha (1976-79); $1,220/ha
(1980) and $1,330/ha for 1981. These authorized amounts do not necessarily
represent the actual cost of the grant since material components of the
grant are fixed in terms of quantities of inputs rather than money. The
present procedure for a grant adjustment involves approval by (a) ORRAF's
Board, (b) a special subcommittee consisting of representatives from various
governmental agencies, including the Ministry of Finance; (c) the MOAC and
finally (d) the Cabinet. This involves considerable time and duplication of
effort since most of the representatives of the agencies involved in this
approval process are already members of ORRAF's Board (para. 4.10).
2.17      Performance under the Rubber Replanting Project (Loan 1243-TI).
During 1960-76, about 200,000 ha or 13% of the rubber area in South Thailand
was replanted. Under the Bank-financed Rubber Replanting Project ($50
million, 1976), another 145,000 ha were replanted during 1977-80, resulting
:in a total replanted area of about 345,000 ha (21% of the total rubber area).
In 1981, an additional 65,600 ha will be replanted (Annex 1, Table 2).
2.18      About 116,000 new grants were initiated between 1977-80, with an
average rubber replanted area of about 1.3 ha. In 1979, about 95% of the
grant payments went to farmers with a rubber replanting area of less than 8
ha. About one third of these farmers are in the target group (defined as
having per capita incomes less than one third of the national average), and
about 10% to 15% are currently in the absolute poverty group (defined as
having annual per capita incomes less than $180 in 1981 terms).



- 12 -
2.19      The replanting rate has been slightly slower than that envisioned
during appraisal, with about 90% of the target reached in 1979 and about 85%
in 1980. This has resulted from a one-year delay in project effectiveness
due to legal problems in Thailand, security problems in South Thailand, and
relatively high rubber prices./l These factors and lower fertilizer prices,
which have reduced the need for Bank funds, have caused Bank disbursements
to be slower than anticipated. Disbursements are, however, increasing and
could be completed by early 1982. At present, no problems are envisaged in
maintaining a 50,000 ha p.a. replanting rate for the future.
2.20      Apart from ORRAF, the main institutions involved in the subsector
include the following:
(a) The Horticulture Division of the DOA carries out research on fruit
crops, coconut, and oil palm, and provides seed gardens and
nurseries for these crops. Assistance is being provided to the
Division under the Bank-s National Agricultural Research Project
(Loan 1922-TH);
(b) The Rubber Division in DOA is the official regulatory body for the
rubber industry in Thailand. In addition, its 19 field stations
provide areas of planted rubber for experimentation and
demonstration, besides producing budded stumps and budwood, which
are sold directly to farmers or passed on to ORRAF. The
organization of the Rubber Division is given in Chart 22218;
(c) The RRC, established within the DOA in 1965, is responsible for:
agronomic and economic research in production and- processing;
adaptation of research findings; and dissemination of information
among producers and processors. The organization of the RRC is
shown in Chart 22218, and details of its operations are presented
in Annex 3; and
(d)  The DAE in MOAC provides extension services, advises farmers
on agricultural techniques, and provides support services to the
many Group Marketing Organizations (GMO) established throughout
the country.
2.21      In addition, two coordinating agencies are involved with the rubber
subsector. As a result of the Rubber Replanting Project, a Technical Assis-
tance Coordinating Committee was formed within the MOAC comprising represen-
tatives of ORRAF, RRC, UNDP/FAO and DAE. The Committee meets bimonthly to
discuss technical matters requiring research and ways to channel research
findings to farmers. It has proved to be particularly useful in conveying
technical information to ORRAF's Board and for requesting the Board's
approval of procedural changes at the farm level. And, under the UNDP-
financed Bridging Project, a Rubber Consultative Group has been established
/1 During periods of high rubber prices, the number of applications tends
to decline, as farmers wish to postpone replanting due to the increased
profitability of tapping.



- 13 -
to advise Government on (a) the technical and managerial requirements of
Thailand-s rapidly expanding rubber industry, and (b) priorities for the
research and training programs needed by ORRAF to meet the requirements of
its rubber replanting and new planting programs.  The Group is comprised of
representatives of the main agencies involved in the subsector.
3. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01      The proposed project would continue Bank support of the successful
Rubber Replanting Project (Loan 1243-TH), although with some additional
features to promote development of tree crops nationwide.
3.02      The main objectives of the proposed project would be:
(a) to increase, or at least maintain, the income level of
smallholders living on relatively poor soils in rainfed areas
by expanding rubber production;
(b) to improve the balance of payments by increasing rubber exports;
and
(c)  to provide a basis for further development of the tree crop
subsector nationwide.
B.  Brief Description
3.03      The main components would be:
(a) ORRAF. The proposed project would cover a four-year time slice
(April 1982-April 1986) of ORRAF's entire program, comprising:
(i) agricultural development in South and Southeast Thailand
including:
a. Rubber Replanting
-   new starts: continuation of an ongoing program at a
rate of 50,000 ha p.a. (200,000 ha over the project
period, involving about 166,000 smallholder plots);
and
-   continuation and completion of about 212,000 ha
of replantings started prior to April 1, 1982,
involving about 151,400 smallholder plots.



- 14 -
b. Rubber New Planting. Technical support in establishing
the crop and during the immature period to smallholders
participating in a rubber new planting pilot scheme to be
financed by BAAC. About 16,000 ha will be planted during
the first year of the pilot scheme.
(ii) ORRAF's administration and management, covering civil works,
equipment, vehicles, staffing and operating costs over the
project period; and
(iii) the consultant services of a Senior Agricultural Advisor to
ORRAF, and training for ORRAF staff in the cultivation of
coconut and its intercrops (coffee and cocoa) in order to
strengthen ORRAF's capability to furnish technical support
for these crops.
(b) DOA
(i) expansion of rubber research in Thailand and enhancement of
the research capability in RRC;/l and
(ii) establishment of 60 ha of coconut seed gardens in
the South.
(c)  LDD.  A land-use survey including mapping of the coconut growing
areas in six nrovinces in the South to assess the resource base for
long-range coconut development in these provinces, and consultant
services to prepare a proposal for a countrywide agricultural
land-use survey; and
(d)  OAE.  Strengthening OAE's agro-economic planning capability to serve
and guide the tree crop subsector through (i) training of staff
and (ii) a study of the potential for tree crop development
nationwide, including the financial, technical and institutional
implications thereof.
C. Detailed Features
ORRAF
3.04      Agricultural Development.  ORRAF's development activities over the
project period would continue to focus on its ongoing rubber replanting
program, comprising (a) the continuation of rubber replanting at a rate of
50,000 ha p.a., totalling 200,000 ha during the project period, and (b)
continued development and completion of about 212,000 ha replanted before
/1 Research for other tree crops has been appropriately covered in the
Bank's National Agricultural Research Project (Ln. 1922-TH).



- 15 -
April 1, 1982. In addition, ORRAF's development activities would be
expanded to include provision of technical support to a pilot scheme for
rubber new planting (para. 3.09).
3.05      Nurseries.  ORRAF presently controls about 310 ha of rubber stock
nurseries and intends to increase the nursery area to 555 ha by 1982. This
is considered appropriate to the needs of ORRAF's replanting and new rubber
planting programs. In addition, about 210 ha of budwood nurseries have been
developed, which is considered sufficient for ORRAF's requirements over the
project period.
3.06      Implementation Schedule.  Table 3.1 presents details of ORRAF's
lmplementation schedule during the project period.
Table 3.1: IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE OF ORRAF, 1982-85

3.07      Replanting Grants.  ORRAF would continue to assist rubber growers
with the establishment and maintenance of rubber replanting through advice and
training as well as through replanting grants in cash and in kind. The grant
would include a cash entitlement covering 70% of the estimated labor cost.
Cash would comprise about 47% of the grant (land preparation 23% and mainten-
ance operations 24%) and materials in kind about 53% of the grant (chemicals
5%, fertilizers 42% and plant material 6%). Cash payments to smallholders
would depend on certification of ORRAF inspectors after satisfactory
completion of specific tasks.
3.08      The cost of the ORRAF replanting grant payments (including ferti-
lizers, chemicals, plant material, labor and residual payments, for the
new rubber replantings) and existing commitments, are detailed in Annex 4,
Table 2. The indirect expenses of the ORRAF grant, mainly local fertilizer
transport cost and miscellaneous expenses, are presented in Annex 4, Table 6.



- 16 -
3.09      Rubber New Planting.  It is proposed that ORRAF would provide
technical support, consisting of advice and training, to smallholders
participating in a pilot scheme for rubber new planting during the
establishment and immature period of the crop. The pilot scheme would be
located in Rayong and Chanthaburi Provinces in the east, and about 16,000 ha
of land would be planted during the first year of the scheme. The program
would be financed on a pilot basis by credit through BAAC. Establishment
and maintenance standards would be the same as under ORRAF-s replanting
program. A committee has been established, with representatives from the
concerned agencies (BAAC, Cooperative Promotion Department, Forestry
Department, Rubber Estate Organization, DOA and ORRAF) to oversee program
implementation. ORRAF would provide the necessary support using existing
regional office field staff.
3.10      Administration.  ORRAF-s administration and management costs over
the project period include staff salaries, labor wages, civil works (including
purchase of land), vehicles, equipment, and operating costs. Details of these
costs during the project period are given in Annex 4, Tables 3 and 4.
During the project period ORRAF headquarters staff would increase from a
total of 359 at present to about 620 in 1985, and its field staff from 1,184
to about 2,180. About 30 ORRAF vehicles, ranging from cars to trucks, would
need replacement and an additional 35 vehicles would need to be purchased.
Low-interest loans are provided to field staff for the purchase of
motorbikes. About 12 new ORRAF branch offices would be constructed during
the project period.
3.11      Training and Technical Assistance.  Apart from its ongoing rubber
replanting program, ORRAF is responsible for providing limited assistance to
rubber growers replanting with coconut.  To date, however, it has had little
involvement with coconut growers.  Under the project, the capability of
ORRAF staff to provide technical support for coconut and its intercrops
(coffee and cocoa) would be strengthened through local training courses, as
well as fellowships and study tours to neighboring countries to be offered
to qualifying staff. The project would also help finance the continued
services of a Senior Agricultural Advisor to ORRAF, who is already in place.
Details and cost estimates are presented in Annex 4, Table 5.
3.12      The training courses in coconut cultivation would be provided at
DOA-s Sawii, Kanthuli and Nai-Chong research stations. The courses would
last from one to three months each. Selected ORRAF nursery managers would
receive three-month courses in hybrid coconut nursery layout, coconut
germination, polybag planting, appropriate weeding, watering, fertilizer, pest
and disease control, culling and selection standards, and field transport.
ORRAF field officers would receive two-month courses in correct felling and
land preparation techniques, lining, holing, field planting, appropriate
weeding, fertilizing, pest and disease control standards, and harvesting of
hybrid coconut. Finally, field officers would receive one-month introductory
training in nursery and field establishment and upkeep standards, harvesting,
and processing.



- 17 -
Department of Agriculture (DOA)
3.13      Rubber Research Center.  During the project period the research
capability of RRC would be strengthened to cope with: (a) ORRAF's expanding
rubber development program in Southeast Thailand where ecological conditions
are different from those in the South, (b) the urgent need to generate more
research data on the possibilities for expanding rubber cultivation in the
North and Northeast, and (c) an increasing demand for appropriate recommenda-
tions regarding choice of clones, type of plant material, density of planting,
intercropping, husbandry practices, use of fertilizers during the immature and
mature stage, pest and disease control, tapping systems and stimulation
techniques for young, mature and old rubber, processing and marketing.
Government, with the help of the Rubber Consultative Group, is currently
reviewing the staffing, organizational and financial requirements of this
strengthening, and intends to seek UNDP financing for the program subsequently
identified. If UNDP financing cannot be obtained, the Government would
finance the program from its own resources. The present estimate of the cost
of this component should be considered as indicative only.
3.14      Hybrid Coconut Seed Gardens.  Under the project, DOA would
establish about 60 ha of coconut seed gardens in the South. Hybrid seed
nut production would start in 1988 and would supplement the hybrid coconut
seed supply from the Kanthuli seed garden. Dwarf coconuts would probably be
acquired from Malaysia and possibly selected Talls would be raised in the seed
gardens under DOA½s guidance and control. Details and cost estimates are
presented in Annex 4, Table 9.
Land Development Department (LDD)
3.15      Under the project, LDD would undertake a land-use survey of the
coconut-growing areas in Chumpon, Surat Thani, Nakon Si Thammarat, Pattani,
Songkla and Phuket provinces in South Thailand. The Land Classification
Division in LDD would conduct this survey using recent aerial photographs
(1:15,000). Vehicles and equipment would be provided to enable LDD to
complete this task by FY84. On the basis of the color maps produced, more
sophisticated planning could be developed regarding the required replanting
rate and the possibility of rehabilitating suitable tall coconut stands
through the use of inputs and/or intercropping. Details and cost estimates
are presented in Annex 4, Table 10.
3.16      While existing (largely pre-1975) aerial photography may be ade-
quate for estimating the area currently under coconut in the six principal
coconut-growing provinces, the available photography is inadequate for
providing up-to-date data on agricultural land use for much of the country,
largely due to its age. The absence of reliable current data on crops and
other land use categories is a serious impediment to planning in most sectors
and at all scales. Accordingly, two man-months of consultant services are
included in the project to assess the current situation in regard to aerial



- 18 -
photography and land-use data and to prepare a proposal for rephotography of
the country as a whole, on a scale adequate for detailed land-use analysis,
and for full photo interpretation and map compilation services within a
finite period, probably three years.
Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE)
3.17      The OAE is responsible for sector planning, including the formu-
lation of agricultural policy options in the MOAC (para. 2.09). To better
equip OAE to plan for further development of the tree crop subsector, the
project would provide for a study of tree crop development nationwide,
specifically covering the financial, technical and institutional implications
of an expanded program for development of new rubber in the North and
Northeast and of hybrid coconut and its intercrops (coffee and cocoa) in the
South. The study would be carried out by consultants (about 9 man-months of
services are contemplated) under the auspices of OAE, but overseen by ORRAF
to ensure that the results of the study are readily applicable. The project
would also include fellowships and study tours for OAE staff to study
policy aspects of tree crop development, processing and marketing in
neighboring countries. Details and cost estimates are presented in Annex 4,
Table 5.
D. Cost Estimates
3.18      Total project cost is estimated at about $358.8 million (B 8.25 bil-
lion) of which $143.5 million (40%) would be in foreign exchange, with taxes
and duties representing about $11 million. Table 3.2 summarizes the cost
estimates; details are presented in Annex 4, Table 1. Expected price
increases over the project period amount to about 26% of total base costs plus
physical contingencies, which reflect mid-1981 price estimates. The following
annual inflation rates have been assumed:
1981   1982    1983    1984    1985    1986
Local costs (%)       13.0   12.0    12.0    10.0       9.0      8.0
Foreign costs (%)      9.0    8.5      7.5      7.5     7.5      6.0
Physical contingencies (averaging about 10% of base costs) have been applied
to all vehicles, equipment and civil works. No provision for physical
contingencies has been made for: (a) agricultural development costs since
these are based on actual costs of an ongoing program; or (b) for ORRAF's
operating costs and other costs of the DOA, LDD and OAE, since the project
comprises a time slice of a large investment program where the major sources

of uncertainty and risk do not relate to the estimates of the physical and
administrative implementation requirements. The services of a Senior
Agricultural Advisor to ORRAF and the preparation of the tree crop devel-
opment study and the national land-use survey proposal would require a total of
52 man-months of consultant services at an estimated total cost of $365,500.
The cost of foreign consultants is estimated at about $10,900/man-month
(including international and local travel and subsistence) and that of local
consultants, at about $4,500/man-month.
E. Financing
3.19      The Bank and CDC would assist Government in financing the proposed
project. The Bank loan of $142 million, plus a possible UNDP grant of about
$1.5 million mainly for strengthening RRC, would cover the full foreign
exchange requirements of the project. The Bank loan would be passed on to
ORRAF as a grant. A CDC loan for E 10 million (about $18.5 million
equivalent) would be applied toward local costs, bringing total external
financing to about 45% of project costs. The remaining local costs would
be covered by government budgetary allocations ($31.8 million) and ORRAF's
own sources (165 million). If UNDP funds are not obtained, GovernTment
will finance the strengthening of RRC with its own funds. Details of pro-
ject financing are presented in Table 3.3.
F. Procurement
3.20      Fertilizer and chemical contracts (about $152 million) would be
procured in bulk through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with Bank Group guidelines. A preference equal to 15% of the cif cost r the
customs duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in
the evaluation of bids. Contracts for urgently needed fertilizers and
chemicals estimated to cost less than $500,000, up to an aggregate amount of
$2.5 million, may be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding (LCB)
in accordance with procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts
for civil works over $500,000 (totalling about $3.3 million) would be awarded
on the basis of ICB in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Contracts for
civil works costing less than $500,000 each would be awarded on the basis of
local competitive bidding in accordance with procurement procedures acceptable
to the Bank. The civil works contracts are expected to be small and
scattered throughout the country, and are therefore expected to be of
interest only to local contractors. The vehicles and equipment are of
numerous types which would normally be purchased in small lots; these would be
awarded on the basis of LCB in accordance with procurement procedures
acceptable to the Bank. Research equipment, coconut seed nuts, and other
miscellaneous items costing less than $15,000 each, up to an aggregate amount

of $1.5 million would be purchased by prudent shopping on the basis of at
least three price quotations. About 75% of plant material requirements would
be provided by ORRAF's own nurseries and by private nurseries at competitive
prices. For all contracts estimated to exceed $250,000 the Bank's prior
approval would be required before invitations to bid are issued and contracts
are awarded.
G. Disbursement
3.21      The proposed Bank loan of $142 million would be disbursed to
ORRAF ($141.3 million), DOA ($0.25 million), LDD ($0.15 million), and OAE
($0.30 million), as follows:
ORRAF
(a) 65% of total cost of fertilizers and chemicals;
(b) 40% of total cost of vehicles, equipment, planting material and
civil works;
(c) 100% of total cost of technical assistance and training;
and
(d) 30% of total cost of first two installments of labor payments
to rubber replanters and of salaries of ORRAF field staff.
DOA
(a) 65% of total cost of fertilizers, chemicals, vehicles, equipment
and civil works; and
(b) 40% of total cost of planting materials.
LDD
(a) 70% of total cost of equipment, vehicles and materials; and
(b) 100% of total cost of technical assistance and training.
OAE
(a) 100% of total cost of technical assistance and training.

3.22      ORRAF.  Disbursement of the Bank loan would be against full
documentation for fertilizers and chemicals, vehicles, equipment, civil
works, and technical assistance and training. Disbursements for planting
material and labor payments would be directly linked to the progress of
implementation, and disbursement requests would be prepared on the basis of
field inspectors' reports, certificates of delivery of planting material and
labor payments. The first installment of the grant for labor payments is
released to smallholders after the completion and inspection of land
clearing and preparation; the second after the completion and inspection of
planting. Bank disbursements for planting material, labor payments, and
salaries of ORRAF field staff would be made against statements of expendi-
ture, and the documentation for such items would be retained by ORRAF and
would be available for inspection by the Bank during project supervision.
The statements of expenditure would be certified by ORRAF's Deputy Director
for Administration and Finance.
3.23      DOA/OAE/LDD.  Bank disbursements for civil works, vehicles, equip-
ment, and technical assistance and training would be made against full
documentation. Disbursements for planting material would be made against
certified statements of expenditure, and the supporting documents would be
retained by DOA and made available for inspection during the course of Bank
supervision missions.
3.24      It is expected that disbursements would be completed by
March 31, 1987. A disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 4, Table 11.
The disbursement estimates were based on the actual rate of disbursement
under the Rubber Replanting Project (Loan 1243-TH), but adjusted for
expected improvements in ORRAF's procedures.
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Implementation
4.01      Research.  DOA would be responsible for all tree crop research.
DOA's rubber research capability would be strengthened during the project
period by expanding the research capacity of RRC.  Assurances were obtained
that Government would review the staffing, organization and financing needs
of the RRC and submit the findings of the review to the Bank by June 30,
1982 for its comments, and implement such measures as it deemed appropriate
after consultation with the Bank.
4.02      Agricultural Inputs.  DOA would also be responsible for the
production of foundation stock. Its capability in this respect is adequate
for all tree crops except coconut, and the project would assist DOA in estab-
lishing 60 ha of coconut seed gardens in South Thailand (para. 3.14).
Nurseries to provide material to smallholders for rubber replanting are
supplied by ORRAF and the private sector, with some help from the Rubber
Division of the DOA. This arrangement would be continued under the project
both for rubber replanting and new planting. Initial technical support to



- 24 -
rubber replanting and new planting would be handled by ORRAF, which would also
continue to provide technical advice to rubber growers replanting with
coconut.  Other inputs for rubber replanting and new planting would be
supplied by ORRAF.
4.03      Financing.  Rubber replanting would continue to be financed by ORRAF
through grants to farmers, while development of rubber new planting would be
financed by BAAC through long-term credits (15-20 years including 5-7.5
years' grace) at 10% interest. The Farmers' Aid Fund contributed finance to
BAAC which allows it to provide credit at less than its normal rate of 13%.
Government has been advised of the Bank's reservations regarding the success
of a credit scheme to individual smallholders for rubber new planting, but
still wishes to proceed on a pilot basis. Assurances have been obtained that
the Government would periodically exchange views with the Bank on the
suitability of the terms and conditions applicable to the provision of funds
to smallholders for the development of tree crops other than the replanting of
rubber.
4.04      Extension services during the productive (mature) period of the
crops would be provided by the DAE. Only the rubber replanted in the past
would come into production during the project period, and would require these
services. Strengthening of DAE in the rubber-producing areas would be carried
out under the Bank's Second National Extension Project (Loan 1752-TH), which
should result in one extension agent covering about 1,000 smallholder
families, or about 2,500 ha of rubber.
4.05      Training.  DOA and ORRAF staff are well trained in rubber cultiva-
tion and production, and existing training facilities are adequate for the
near future. Although ORRAF staff also have some advisory responsibilities
for coconut production, they lack adequate training in this regard. Under the
project DOA would be responsible for training ORRAF's field officers in
correct nursery and field planting techniques, upkeep standards, use of inputs
and harvesting, as well as the processing and marketing of coconut
(paras. 3.11-3.12). Assurances were obtained that Government would ensure
that DOA facilities at Sawii, Kanthuli and Nai-Chong would be made available
for the training of ORRAF staff in the cultivation of coconut and its inter-
crops.
4.06      Subsector Development.  In preparation for further development of
the subsector, OAE would engage consultants to undertake a study of tree crop
development nationwide. Should the study recommend a substantial expansion
of ORRAF's responsibilities in the subsector, assurances were obtained that
ORRAF would exchange views with the Bank with respect to its organizational
structure and the numbers, qualifications and experience of staff required to
carry out the duties assigned to it.
4.07      In addition, OAE staff would be appropriately trained in the
economic aspects of tree crop development, processing and marketing in order
to (a) develop an agro-economic planning capability so as to advise



- 25 -
responsible agencies (e.g. DOA, ORRAF) on the economic advantages of crops
under area-specific conditions; (b) strengthen its staff to more efficiently
formulate policy options regarding tree crop development at the regional and
the national levels for consideration by MOAC; and (c) play a more prominent
role in coordinating the activities of the various departments and agencies
involved in the subsector such as ORRAF, DOA, DAE, BAAC, the Public Welfare
Department and the Accelerated Rural Development Department in order to
facilitate the flow of information among these agencies and to ensure that
uniform implementation standards are maintained.
4.08      Land Use Surveys.  The Land Classification Division in LDD would be
responsible for undertaking a land-use survey of coconut-growing areas in six
provinces in the South and for preparing a proposal for a countrywide
agricultural land use survey (paras. 3.15-3.16). The terms of reference of
the consultants preparing the national land use survey would specify the time
by which the survey would be completed.
ORRAF
4.09      ORRAF would be primarily responsible for project implementation.
Staff in the various divisions of ORRAF-s headquarters and in the provincial
and field offices (Chart 22200) would be expanded in line with the expansion
of ORRAF's development activities; no problems are envisaged in recruiting
the additional staff required. Assurances were obtained from ORRAF that: (a)
it would, at all times, employ qualified staff in adequate numbers to carry
out the duties assigned to it, and (b) before making any new appointment to
the position of D)irector or Deputy Director of the Fund, it would afford the
Bank a reasonable opportunity to exchange views on the qualifications and
experience of persons considered for such positions. It is expected that the
consultant services of the Senior Agricultural Advisor to ORRAF, who is
already in place, would be continued during the project. However, in the
event of the hiring of a new consultant assurances were obtained from ORRAF
that the consultant's qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of
employment would be satisfactory to the Bank.
4.10      Adjustment of Grant Payments.  An important reason for ORRAF's
success has been its administration of the replanting grant payments. While
the level of the grant has consistently offered sufficient incentive to
attract potential rubber replanters, the process of adjusting the grant level
is cumbersome by involving numerous governmental departments. Assurances were
obtained that Government would (a) allow ORRAF to adopt a policy whereby the
level of the grant would be reviewed annually, and raised when necessary to
reflect changes in input prices, wage rates and technical recommendations made
by RRC, and (b) simplify the procedures for approving adjustments in the grant
level.



- 26 -
4.11      Financial Arrangements.  It is currently estimated that subsequent
to the proposed project by the end of FY87, ORRAF would require about
$290 million to maintain and complete the rubber replantings then under way.
Assurances were obtained that after project completion Government would
provide ORRAF with the necessary funds to bring into production all rubber
replantings supported under the project. Government has considerable flexibi-
lity in controlling ORRAF's financial position through its control over the
level of the rubber replanting cess. In accordance with Government's policy
of ensuring the long-term financial self-sufficiency of ORRAF, assurances were
obtained that Government would review with the Bank from time to time, the
level of the rubber cess, its allocation and the incentives of smallholders to
participate in rubber production; and would exchange views with the Bank prior
to making any changes therein. Government is also able to affect the level of
farmer participation in rubber replanting through its taxes on rubber which,
together with the cess, affect farmers' incentives to replant. Although
Government has recently reduced the level of taxation of rubber in Thailand,
the present level is still too high (para. 6.04). Assurances were therefore
obtained that Government would, from time to time, exchange views with the
Bank concerning the level of taxes and duties on rubber production, marketing
and export.
B. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.12      The Planning and Monitoring Unit in ORRAF was created during the
early stages of the first Rubber Replanting Project. It is responsible for
monitoring implementation of the rubber replanting program particularly with
regard to the socio-economic impact of rubber replanting, smallholder
incentives and participation, and consequent policy formulation. In 1979/80,
the Unit and OAE collaborated on a socio-economic survey of grant-receiving
rubber replanters. The sample size of the survey was about 1,300 farms.
The information gathered in the survey has provided some useful insights into
the characteristics of the grant beneficiaries (para. 6.07). A regular
resurvey is needed of a smaller sample size, based on repeated visits to the
same replanters with a view to more clearly defining their incomes and
activities. In addition, surveys of the participating smallholders in rubber
new planting and coconut areas should now be started under this program.
Particular attention would be focused on the smaller farmers, especially those
in the absolute poverty group. Assurances were obtained from ORRAF that an
economic and policy working group would be established in its Planning and
Monitoring Unit, which would regularly update the socio-economic survey, and
submit, by the end of each fiscal year, the findings of such group to the Bank
for its review and comment.



- 27 -
C. Accounts and Audits
4.13      ORRAF's accounts are audited by the National Auditing Council at the
end of every financial year on the basis of guidelines recommended by the Bank
for the first Rubber Replanting Project. Internal auditing is carried out by
a special unit (consisting of ten staff members) which is responsible to the
Director. Consultants engaged during the first project made detailed recom-
mendations for improving ORRAF's accounting and auditing procedures, and their
proposals are being implemented. The staff in the internal audit unit are
competent, and when these recommendations have been effected, ORRAF's account-
ing and auditing procedures can be considered satisfactory. Assurances were
obtained that ORRAF would: (a) maintain, in accordance with sound accounting
practices, records of its financial and operational activities; (b) have its
accounts for each fiscal year audited by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank, in accordance with appropriate auditing procedures consistently
applied; and (c) submit to the Bank within six months of the end of every
fiscal year during project implementation a certified copy of the auditor's
report including a separate opinion by said auditors in respect of
disbursements made on the basis of statements of expenditure.
4.14      Assurances were also obtained from Government that the DOA, LDD and
OAE would: (a) maintain in accordance with sound accounting practices project
accounts covering all project expenditures; (b) have project accounts for
each fiscal year audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, in
accordance with appropriate auditing procedures consistently applied; and
(c) submit to the Bank within six months of the end of every fiscal year
during project implementation a certified copy of the auditor's report
including a separate opinion by said auditors in respect of disbursements made
on the basis of statements of expenditure.

5. PRODUCTION, MAiRKETING, PRICES AND INCOMES
A. Production
5.01      Technical Specifications.  Rubber replanting is well established
in Thailand.  Technical specifications for ORRAF's program were established
under the first Rubber Replanting Project, and would be continued under
the proposed project (see Annex 1).
5.02      Impact of ORRAF.  With the ORRAF program continuing and being
supported by the project, total rubber planting in Thailand would take place
at about 68,000 ha/year, while if ORRAF were to cease new commitments from the
end of 1981, total plantings would be drastically reduced to an estimated
20,000 ha annually in the long term (Table 5.1).

5.03      The main impact of ORRAF's activities under the project would be
felt in the 1990s and beyond. Estimated incremental production resulting from
ORRAF-supported rubber planting commenced under the project and then continued
at the 1985 level of activity is shown in Table 5.2. Production of rubber in
Thailand is projected to increase by about 5% p.a. durin.g the 1980s although
the increase would be slightly lower with the ORRAF program than without it.
This is because of the production foregone as a result of felling low yielding
stands (for replanting). However, once production f,rom plantings started from
1982 onwards becomes significant (in the early 1990s), the effect of continu-
ing the replanting program would become positive, and both total and incremen-
tal production would increase substantially.  In the situation. without OR-RAF,
however, production would continue to increase until the early 1.990s but then,
as the proportion of senile trees became increasingly large, it would fall.
By the turn of the century production would be nearly half a million tons per
year higher with ORRAF continuing than with no replantilg program.

5.04      Project Production.  Investment in rubber production during the
project period is of equivalent cost to a complete replanting of 155,000 ha of
rubber./l On the basis of this area, total rubber productior directly attri--
butable to project investment would be about 3.2 million tons over a 30--year
period, peaking at about 250,000 tons annually in the late 1990se This would
be equivalent to 20-25% of projected Thai rubber exports and about 3-5% of
world trade in 1995.
/1 See Annex 5, para. 4.



- 30 -
B. Organization of Marketing
5.05      Incremental rubber production would be marketed along the present
lines with farmers selling air dried sheets to local traders or else forming
GMOs and dealing directly with wholesalers and exporters. In either case,
exporters would normally buy graded unsmoked sheets which they would
subsequently export. Local traders would continue to buy scrap rubber which
would be used as an input to the block rubber manufacturing plants. In
parallel with the project, it is expected that a greater number of GMOs
will be established. These have proved to be a cost effective way of
bulking smallholders' production, and studies have indicated that when rubber
is sold through them prices are competitive and reflect a fair proportion of
the f.o.b. price adjusted for taxes.
5.06      Thailand has had a decade of successful experience in handling
expanding rubber exports and has a number of well organized and effective
exporters. Consequently no problems are foreseen in dealing with the
projected increases over the next 10 to 15 years (which are likely to be at a
lower annual rate than in the 1970s). The main market for incremental rubber
is likely to be Japan although Thailand also sells to other major markets such
as Singapore, New York and London.
5.07      Quality of Thai rubber exports is adequate, but not high, with the
bulk of its ribbed smoked sheet (RSS) exports being grade 3. With
increasing quantities of rubber being marketed through the GMOs where the
quality is relatively high (for smallholder production) it is anticipated
that the average quality will improve over the next decade.
C. Product Prices
5.08      Financial prices are estimated on the basis of Bank projections
for world rubber prices adjusted for international freight, the domestic
cost of marketing and the present level of taxation of rubber. Details are
given in Annex 5, Tables 2 and 3. The average farmgate rubber price is
based on the assumption that 80% of output would be unsmoked sheet of RSS 3
quality and 20% would be scrap. Estimated financial and economic /1
prices for rubber are summarized in Table 5.3.
/1 The difference between "economic" and "financial" prices is due
mainly to direct taxation (see Annex 5, Table 3).

D. Farm Level Financial Impact
5.09      The financial impact at the farm level of replantina with an ORRAF
grant will depend upon (a) whether the farmer uses family or hired labor,
and (b) the system of exploitation (daily or alternate daily tapping). Per
hectare financial budgets for rubber replanting have been prepared /1 and are
summarized in Table 5.4. Models A, B, and C represent the most likely
replanting situations with the project, i.e. with ORRAF grants, and Models D
and E show the effect of replanting without ORRAF grants. Each model compares
replanting with the alternative of continuing to tap senile rubber for up
to nine years and then abandoning it. Rubber replanters receiving ORRAF
grants can be categorized approximately as Model A 20%, Model B 50% and Model
C 30%. Of the farmers who would replant without ORRAF, about 75% would fall
into Model D and 25% into Model E. As demonstrated in Table 5.1, the total
number of hectares replanted "with" project would be substantially larger than
"without project."
5.10      Replanters receiving ORRAF grants and using hired labor (Models A
and B) would suffer an average reduction in farm incomes of about $120/ha/year
for the first eight years after replanting. However, once the rubber is in
production, and the initial investments in tapping and processing equipment
have been made, net additional income would average about $930/ha/year for

alternate daily tappers and $805/ha/year for daily tappers from the years
10-20. These estimates are based on real labor costs increasing by 3% p.a.
between 1981 and 1995. Should wage rates remain at the real 1981 levels the
increase in income during years 10-20 would be $965/ha/year for daily tapping
and $1065/ha/year for farmers tapping alternate days. Farmers using family
labor, with no alternative employment opportunities (Model C), would be
financially worse off during the first eight years by an average of
$285/ha/year, but would devote an average of 60 man-days/ha/ year less to
rubber because the per hectare labor requirement for replanting rubber is less
than for tapping senile rubber. However, once the replanted rubber comes into
production their income would increase sharply and from years 10-20 would
average about $1,300/ha/year with an additional input requirement of about
150 man-days/ha/year compared to not replanting. The impact of replanting on
household income is discussed in paras. 6.02-6.04.
5.11      After taking account of grant income, the financial returns to
farmers undertaking ORRAF replants are attractive, and it can be expected that
there should be little problem of uptake of the ORRAF replanting program.
However, the financial returns for replanting without ORRAF grants (Models D
and E) are moderate, with the financial rate of return (FRR) for replanting
using hired labor being about 12.8%. This and the relatively high per ha
reduction in income during years 1-8 support the thesis that the rate of
replanting using farmers' own resources (and at lower input levels) would be
considerably lower without ORRAF than with ORRAF continuing its program.
6. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries
6.01      The proposed project has many attractive features:
(a)  benefits are widely distributed, with more than half accruing ta
the "Target Group";/1
(b)  investment cost per person directly benefitted is low, averaging
about $400;
/1 In the context of World Bank projects in Thailand the "Target Group" is
defined as including those families with a per capita income (PCI) of
less than one third of the national average.



- 34 -
(c)  implementation capacity has already been fully demonstrated and
the number of persons directly benefitted large - estimated at
about one million;
(d)  the economic rate of return (ERR) is sound, at 15%;
(e)  risks are low in that the ERR is robust and the organization
implementing the project is proven to be effective; and
(f)  because the project covers a time slice of a continuing program,
it is replicable.
Besides substantially reducing poverty from the early 1990s among farmers on
relatively poor soils in the rainfed agricultural areas of southern Thailand,
project benefits would also include (a) substantially increased rubber produc-
tion giving rise to higher exports and public revenues (through taxes);
(b) increased employment opportunities for low paid agricultural workers; and
(c) the initiation of efforts to develop the tree crop subsector nationwide.
6.02      Impact on Poverty among Rubber Smallholders.  As a result of contin-
uing with ORRAF during FY82-85, replantings would be initiated on about
166,000 plots. Since some farmers would have more than one ORRAF-supported
plot on which activities commenced during FY82-85, the total number of
families benefitting would be less than the sum of the number of plots.
However, because of the use of hired labor, it is estimated that in aggregate
about 200,000 different farm families or about 1.2 million people would
directly benefit from ORRAF-supported activities, initiated in FY82-85 under
this project.
6.03      The median ORRAF replanter uses some hired labor (typically a
sharetapper), has 5 ha of land and net income equivalent to about $300 per
capita in 1981 dollar terms. For such a smallholder, the effect of a typical
1.3 ha ORRAF-supported replant, compared to the most likely "without project"
situation (i.e., continuing to tap senile rubber and subsequently abandoning
it) would be to reduce family income by an average of $15 per capita for the
first eight years after replanting, but to increase it by an average of
$90 per capita during years 9-28.
6.04      Table 6.1 below compares projected average and "Target Group" cut-
off Per Capita Incomes (PCIs) for Thailand with the PCI for the median ORRAF
replanter with and without the project. With the project the median ORRAF
replanter would be likely to benefit from an increase in real per capita
income between 1981 and 1995 of 87%, compared with 30% in the most likely
without project case. Both with and without project, the median farmer is
projected to be within the "Target" Group. In 1981 just over half of all



- 35 -
project beneficiaries would fall within this group. By 1995, without the
ORRAF program the proportion falling within the "Target Group" would be
expected to increase to about two thirds, and even with the project, it is
likely that there would be a slightly increasing proportion of "relatively
poor" rubber farmers. The export tax on rubber (excluding the cess) is
still high in view of the low income level of rubber smallholders.
It is equivalent to a 22% rate of taxation at the farm level, despite the
government's recent export tax reduction and the improvement in farmgate
prices as a result of the recent devaluation. Without the tax, the 1995 per
capita income of the median ORRAF replanter would be raised to $725 with the
project and $440 without the project. This raises a serious political
question regarding the level of taxation of rubber in Thailand, especially in
light of the possible expansion of rubber development into the poorer areas of
the North and Northeast.

- 36 -
6.05      The impact of the project on Thailand's rubber production would be
substantial (see paras. 5.02-5.04). By the turn of the century incremental
rubber production worth over $400 million annually would result from having
continued with ORRAF beyond 1981. Production directly attributable to
investment under this project would be worth a total of about $5.0 billion
over a 30-year period. As Thailand is expected to export over 90% of its
rubber production, all incremental production is considered as being for
export. Consequently, Government revenues stemming from taxes on exported
production directly attributable to project investment would total about
$1.1 billion over 30 years and peak at $96 million per year ($63 million
export tax, $23 million cess) at the current level of taxes and cesses,
respectively.
6.06      The long-run employment impact of the 1982-85 ORRAF program would be
to increase agricultural employment from 1991 to 2011 by an average of 80,000
man-years p.a. in the rubber producing areas (Annex 5, Table 11). However,
after increasing slightly in the first three years of the project (by about
9,000 man-years per year) direct agricultural employment would be reduced
during 1985-1990 by an average of about 25,000 man-years per year. This is
because at present price levels a large proportion of farmers (estimated at
the equivalent of 60%) would be likely to continue tapping senile trees in the
"without project" situation for 8-10 years after trees would have been felled
and replanted "with project." Typically, labor requirements for tapping mature
or senile rubber are greater per year than the average labor requirements
during the immature period of young rubber.
6.07      Analysis of farm survey data from smallholders participating in the
ORRAF replanting program indicates that: (a) on average income from paid
employment amounts to about half of net family income; and (b) many rubber
farmers employ hired labor for tapping. From this data and field observa-
tions, it appears that labor is quite mobile and there are adequate employment
opportunities in the rural areas. Thus, no problems are foreseen in absorbing
labor released by the project in the medium term, or reactivating it in the
1990s. In addition to affecting employment at the farm level, about 11,000
man-years of ORRAF employee labor would be required to implement the project;
about 100 personnel would be employed in the coconut seed gardens; and extra
staff positions would be created in RRC. Incremental jobs in the marketing
and processing industries required to handle the rubber produced would peak at
about 4,000 in 1996. Overall, the equivalent of 1.2 million man-years of
employment would result from project investments at an equivalent cost of
$350 per man-year of employment created.
6.08      One of the important long-term benefits of the project would be its
impact on the development of the tree crop subsector. The study of the
financial, technical and institutional implications of tree crop development
nationwide would focus on the development of new rubber in the country's
poorest areas, the North and Northeast, and of hybrid coconut and its inter-
crops in the South. This development has the potential to significantly
inctease farmers  incomes in those areas. A pilot scheme for rubber new
planting would also be tested under the project, while training of OAE staff



- 37 -
in policy aspects of tree crop development, processing and marketing, and of
ORRAF staff in coconut cultivation, would further prepare for the proposed
development of the subsector. In addition to the project's overall impact on
the tree crop subsector, the proposed strengthening of RRC would specifically
benefit rubber development. It would allow RRC to carry out extensive
investigations on the suitability of rubber as a crop in the North and
Northeast of Thailand as well as intensifying its research and training role
in the South. In the long run, the yield enhancing recommendations of the RRC
would benefit most of the half million rubber producing farm families in
Thailand, and could well lead to expansion of rubber in new areas such as the
relatively poor Northeast.
B. Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
6.09      The economic rate of return is estimated to be 15% for the rubber
-replanting component, the cost of which is about $280 million, representing
about 98% of the total project cost.
6.10      The ERR is calculated on the basis of comparing, at economic prices,
forecast agricultural production and its associated benefits and costs
directly attributable to project investment and a "without project" situation
under which it is assumed that ORRAF would take on no new commitments after
the end of 1981.
6.11      Forecasts of yield and input requirements are made on the basis of
present levels of technology. This is equivalent to the assumption that any
changes in cost/benefits due to nonproject factors would be the same in both
the with and without project cases. Economic prices are calculated on the
basis of financial prices adjusted for taxes and subsidies. In line with
World Bank commodities division forecasts, the prices of fertilizer and
rubber are projected to increase over time. Furthermore in the light of -
the rapid growth of the southern Thai economy, economic labor costs (i.e.,
shadow wages, net of productivity gains) are projected to increase at 3% p.a.
in real terms from 1981-1995. Other project costs are assumed not to change
in real terms over the 30-year period of project analysis. Details of the
derivation of economic prices and cost and benefit streams are described in
Annex 5.
6.12      In order to test the stability of the ERR of the project a number
of sensitivity tests were carried out, the principal of which are summarized
in Table 6.2. These sensitivities are based on variations in costs/benefits
of the replanting part of the project, which accounts for about 98% of quanti-
fiable cost and benefits. Thus they are a close proxy for sensitivity tests

Table 6.2: SENSITIVITY ANALYSES - RUBBER REPLANTING
Case                                                                      ERR (%)
1.  Base case                                                               15.3
2.  Price of rubber down 20%                                                13.3
3.  Gross benefits down 10%; all incremental costs up 10%                   12.6
4.  Labor costs increase at 5% per year for 30 years in real terms    12.4
5.  All "with project" costs increase by 10%                                13.9
6.  Labor costs remain constant in real terms                               16.4

8.  Replanting without project doubles                                      14.3
on the whole project. Overall the ERR is satisfactory, and the viability of
the proposed project is relatively insensitive to changes in costs or
benefits.  Switching values, calculated on the basis of an opportunity cost of
capital (OCC) of 12%, indicate that gross benefits could fall by up to 17% and
the project would still have a positive Net Present Value (NPV). The range of
rubber prices at which the project would remain viable is wide, and a fall of
29% would be required to bring the ERR below 12%. The switching values for
individual cost items at 12% OCC are 79% for labor, 101% for materials and
415% for management. Because the project releases labor in the short run, but
requires extra labor in the long term, the effect of changing labor prices by
a constant factor is minor. However, if the real cost of labor were to
increase over time, by a greater rate than the 3% projected, the ERR would
fall. Within the likely range the effect would be relatively small; even with
a real increase in labor costs of 5% per year for 30 years, the ERR would only
fall to 12%. The per hectare rates of return and net present values at
economic prices for the various components of the project are presented in
Annex 5.
C. Additionality
6.13      As the project comprises the whole ORRAF program for FY82-85 it
is analyzed on that basis, i.e. "with ORRAF" compared to "without ORRAF."
However, in that ORRAF is a semi-autonomous body, it is likely that even
without a Bank-financed project it would probably continue, albeit
at a lower level of activity. The mission's best estimate is that without
outside support (i.e., World Bank or special Thai Government funds) but with
no change in the cess rate or real level of grant, ORRAF could continue to
grant aid new replantings during FY82-85 at about 30,000 ha/year. Against
this background the additional impact of the project would be substantial.



- 39 -
It would benefit an additional 700,000 people, and would lead to the
production of $1.3 billion of additional rubber over a 30-year period, peaking
at $150 million/year in 1999.
D. Cost Recovery
6.14      It is estimated that the ORRAF grant represents about 75% of the
cost of replanting one hectare of rubber or about 50% of the farmer's incre-
mental costs of replanting when income foregone is taken into account. At
forecast export prices, and assuming that present formulae for the cess and
export taxes continue to apply to the noninflated price of the product, the
total ORRAF grant cost, without interest, would on average be recovered by the
cess over the life of the replant. The cost recovery ratio would be about
1.1 assuming an opportunity cost of capital of 12%, if both export taxes and
cess are considered as "cost recovery." In sum, project costs would be more
than fully recovered by taxation specific to the rubber industry.
E. Impact on Women
6.15      Women play a major role in agriculture in Thailand and particularly
in the rubber industry. Women represent about 30% of the population which is
actively engaged in rubber replanting activities in the South and Southeast.
They assist mainly in rubber tapping, latex collection, maintenance and
weeding operations, and a small percentage own and manage rubber holdings.
Women are also employed in the rubber factories, where they represent the
majority of the workforce. While no component in the project is designed
specifically to differentiate between beneficiaries by sex, the increase in
rubber replanting activities and the resulting expansion in supporting
services and industries would create substantial employment opportunities for
women in the long run.
6.16      In ORRAF, women who are well represented at all levels comprise
about 60% of the total staff employed at headquarters and about 20% in the
provincial offices. There is no distinction in salaries and wages between the
sexes. It is expected that further employment opportunities would be made
available to women in ORRAF with the expansion in its organization and its
need for additional staff during the project period.



-40 -
F. Environmental Impact
6.17       The project would mainly replace existing old rubber with new
rubber, and less than 10% of the area to be replanted would need terracing to
prevent runoff and erosion. The scattered nature of the plantings would limit
the impact of such runoff and of dissolved plant nutrients.  Intercropping
would be confined to the flat and slightly undulating land to minimize risk of
soil erosion. No major rubber processing facilities are to be constructed;
rubber processing would be mainly confined to the individual holdings.
Fertilizers would be applied to the tree crops to avoid depletion of soil
nutrients. The small amounts of agrochemicals used would have no adverse
environmental effects.
G. Risk
6.18       The level of risk associated with this project is low.  The present
outlook for the world rubber market is favorable, and there is little
likelihood of significant adverse price changes. The implementing agency,
ORRAF, has already built its capacity and is effectively implementing a
large-scale rubber replanting program. ORRAF staff are well accepted by the
farmers and normally are able to carry out their work without hindrance.
6.19       The main project risk is not that the project would fail to show a
reasonable rate of return but that its rate of development could be retarded
by extraneous factors. The most significant is the possibility that
insurgency in South Thailand would become more widespread and ORRAF field
officers would not be able to carry out tasks effectively in an increasingly
large area of the provinces in Which they work. This would result in a lower
level of inputs, and consequently yields would be lower. However, the
probability of the project being affected by insurgency on a regionwide basis
is considered low, although it can be expected that there will continue to be
scattered minor problems in the more remote areas. In sum, the main component
of this project which provides grants and technical support for replanting
smallholder rubber has a very high chance of success.
6.20       The impact of the tree crop development study to be carried out
under the project would depend on Government-s commitment to carry out the
recommendations resulting therefrom. If implemented, the development of new
rubber planting in the Northeast could constitute an important factor in
alleviating poverty in the country's poorest Region by helping to increase
smallholders' incomes.

(d) it would: (i) maintain in accordance with sound accounting prac-
tices, records of its financial and operational activities;
(ii) have its accounts for each fiscal year audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with appropriate

7.03      With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of $142 million, with a 20-year maturity, including a grace
period of 5 years. The Borrower would be the Kingdom of Thailand.

THAILAND
SECOND TREE CROPS PROJECT
Rubber Cultivation and Production
Rubber Production
1.        Over 80% of Thailand's rubber is grown in peninsular Thailand
where it is the principal crop. Rubber cultivation spread to the Southeast
in the early 1970s; test plantings in the North and Northeast have only
recently been established, but preliminary indications are that growth
exceeds expectations. Over the past decade, rubber exports grew at a rate
of about 7% p.a. In 1979, rubber exports exceeded 500,000 tons at a value
of over $600 million (Table 1). Rubber together with rice, cassava and
sugarcane form the most important foreign exchange earners in the agricul-
tural sector. If the present favorable trend in prices continues, rubber
could well become the lead foreign exchange earning crop.
2.        Over 90% of the rubber is grown by smallholders with holdings of
8 ha or less.  In the past, unselected seedlings with low yields potential
were planted, inputs were hardly used and tapping was done daily. Processing
was carried out at the farm, and low grade rubber was produced fetching
relatively low prices. However, with the introduction of the accelerated
rubber replanting program in 1960, modern technology was adopted. High
yielding clonal plant material, use of fertilizers during immaturity and
correct husbandry practices have led to nearly a doubling in rubber exports
in the last decade. Improvements in processing and marketing through Group
Marketing Organizations (GMOs) have resulted in the production of better
quality sheets. The high proportion of scrap rubber exports has been
drastically reduced since 1974 due to processing into block rubber (Table 1).
3.        Latest estimates place Thailand's total rubber area at about 1.6
million ha (end-1980), distributed as follows:
Immature      Mature      Old/senile         Total
------------------   ('000   ha)    -----------------
Unselected seedlings            10           410          420                 840

New plantings               115           325            -                  440
Total                  345           855           420              1,620

Page 2
Areas replanted under ORRAF grant are shown in Table 2.  It appears that
with a replanting rate of 50,000 ha p.a. the old senile rubber stand (mainly
unselected seedlings) will be replanted by about 1995. Replantings after
1995 would begin to include ORRAF's replantings that started in the early
1960s and also rubber that was established by farmers using their own
resources.
4.         Smallholders Incomes.  A recent survey (1980) of 1,300 ORRAF rubber
replanters, operating holdings of an average size of 7 ha, indicates that
average gross family income was about $2,500 in 1979; $1,500 from farm
income and $1,000 from other sources, with farm expenses amounting to about
$700. Net per capita income (family of 6-7 members) was $250-300 for 1979.
About 75% of agricultural income was derived from rubber sales; 10% from
annual crops, and the remainder from perennial crops (7%) and livestock (8%).
5.         Most ORRAF replanters (70%) have holdings varying from 2 to 10 ha
with per capita incomes between $160 and $400, respectively.  In 1979
about 10% to 20% - mostly those with holdings of 2 ha or less - fell in the
'absolute poverty' group with per capita incomes below $160. Rubber
producers who have not received ORRAF assistance typically have similar
levels of family incomes, but a recent survey indicates that the proportion
of their agricultural income derived from rubber is about 46%, compared to
75% for ORRAF participants.
6.         Technical Specifications /1 - Nurseries.  About 75% of clonal plant
material requirements is provided by ORRAF and private field nurseries /2 in
the form of bare root budded stumps, or polybag budded stumps, and 25% is
planted to seed at stake followed by field budding. Quality of plant
material is assured through RRC certification; RRC inspectors twice yearly
inspect all nurseries and remove plants not true to label.
7.         Land Preparation.  About 80% of land clearing is done by hand,
occasionally resulting in labor shortages, delays in field operations and in
incomplete planting programs. To accelerate land clearing operations,
replanters individually or in groups either purchase chainsaws or contract
felling operations to chainsaw gangs at a cost of about $62.50/ha (B 200/rai).
Terracing is needed over about 10% of the area. Rubber planting is done in
the rainy seasons of May-July or October/November each year.
/1 The standards given would be maintained for both the rubber replanting
and new planting programs.
/2 Private nurseries are owned and operated by estates and smallholders
who produce plant material under contract arrangements with ORRAF.

Page 3
8.         Planting.  The Bank suggests that clones GTI, RRIM600, PR255 and
PR261 be planted on the basis of their performance in Malaysia and
Indonesia. RRIM600, PR255 and PR261 are potentially high yielding clones
under optimal conditions, but are less tolerant to poorer soil conditions.
GTI has done well in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Since it performs
relatively better than the other clones in hilly situations and when planted
at relative high density, it is proposed that GTI, PR255 and PR261 each
be planted in about 30% of the area, with the proportion of RRIM600 kept to a
maximum of 10%. The selected high-yielding clonal plant material would be
planted either as seed at stake followed by field budding, budded stumps or
polybag budded stumps, the latter being preferred for its vigorous growth and
shorter immaturity period.
9.         Planting would be done at a density of 500 trees/ha spaced at
3.0 x 6.7 m or 3.5 x 5.7 m on flat and undulating land. The latter spacing
would ensure that the canopy would close in about 3-4 years, resulting in the
shading out of weeds and a reduction in maintenance cost. At this density,
approximately 420 trees would become tappable in 6 years for polybag budded
stumps, 6.5 years for budded stumps and 7 years for seed at stake plantings,
when full inputs, especially fertilizers, are provided. Assuming a task of
about 600 trees per tapping day and the adoption of alternate daily tapping,
one labor unit could exploit about 3 ha of planted rubber, with some
assistance from other family members.
10.        Intercropping.  About 80% of the smallholders intercrop their
rubber stands with annual or short-term perennial crops during the first
year, but only about 20% continue intercropping during the second year, and
almost none thereafter.  Intercropping is acceptable wherever the terrain
and soil conditions are suitable as it provides the farmer with extra income
during the period of immaturity. At the end of one or two years in the
intercropped areas, or from the outset in all other replanted areas, a
leguminous cover crop is established by about 30% of the smallholders.
Cover crop seeds are readily available.
11.        Maintenance and Tapping.  Maintenance is routine and consists
mainly of timely applications of fertilizer, weeding, and disease control
under the guidance of ORRAF inspectors who ensure that planters and
replanters qualify for grant payments. The major disease, present mainly in
the western part of Southern Thailand, is Phytophthora botryosa leaf
disease; in addition, Phytophthora spp cause black stripe panel disease.
The most effective preventive measure is to plant the disease-tolerant clone
GTI (all other clones used in Thailand are more susceptible) and to crown
bud clone RRIM600 with GT1 in the Phytophthora susceptible areas.
Fertilizer is applied at the time of planting, i.e., 125 gm (63 kg/ha) rock
phosphate placed in the planting hole. After planting, fertilizers are
applied at regular intervals reaching a peak in the fourth year at about 415
kg/ha of a mixed fertilizer. Fertilizer application in the mature phase is



- 46 -                              ANNEX 1
Page 4
recommended, since without it the farmer is likely to compensate for reduced
yield by more intensive tapping (i.e., daily rather than every other day as
recommended), thus shortening the tapping cycle to about 19 years, and the
replanting cycle to 26 years.  It is expected, however, that only about 20%
of the rubber replanters would continue fertilizer applications during
maturity and adopt the less intensive tapping system. Yield projections for
the different tapping systems and levels of inputs are presented in Table 3.
12.       Processing and Marketing.  The main requirement in the production of
high quality sheet rubber is cleanliness during tapping, collection, and
processing. The technique is straightforward and well understood by small-
holders. Trees are tapped in the morning, and one tapper would be able to
tap, collect and process latex into wet sheet from an area of 1.5 ha during a
working day extending from about 6 a.m. to 12 noon. Most of the unsmoked
sheet produced will continue to be marketed through existing marketing
channels uhich function efficiently. Many local GMOs have been established
and are effective in improving the quality of rubber produced.
13.       About 90% of the rubber in South Thailand is processed by the
smallholders into unsmoked sheet (wet sheet), since the present premium for
block rubber does not cover the additional investment and processing costs
of conversion from unsmoked sheet into block rubber, except in the case of
scrap rubbers. The unsmoked sheet is sold to small village traders or
through GMOs, to large dealers who process the rubber and export it as
Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS) grades 3 and 4. Several independent marketing
studies have shown that farmers obtain fair prices for their rubber produced
at GMOs, representing 80-90% of f.o.b. prices net of taxes.
14.       Yield Stimulation.  In the 3 to 5 years preceding replanting, it
would be feasible to maximize returns from low-yielding rubber stands through
ethrel stimulation combined, ultimately, with slaughter tapping. Since
smallholders generally replant their rubber holdings in stages, the
additional income derived from stimulation and slaughter tapping would
assist them to bridge the period of decreased income when only part of the
holdings is productive. ORRAF is reviewing the possibility of establishing
pre-replanting application procedures to assist smallholders in setting up a
program of exploiting the old rubber trees prior to felling.

SECOND TREE CROPS PROJECT
The Office of the Rubber Replanting Aid Fund Board
Organization, Staffing and Training
1.        The organizational structure of ORRAF is shown in Chart 22200.
ORRAF is governed by a Board, whose Chairman is the Minister of the MOAC.
The Board sets policy and approves structural and procedural changes as
well as annual programs and budgets. The Director of ORRAF (appointed by
the Chairman) is assisted by two Deputy Directors, one for finance and
administration and one for technical operations. Twelve provincial offices
administer grant payments, supervise replantings and provide extension
services during the development phase. Under the Bank's Rubber Replanting
Project (Loan 1243-TH), ORRAF engaged the services of consultants in 1978
to review and make recommendations on its organization and management
structure, personnel and staffing requirements, management information
systems and organization of operations. The resulting recommendations have
largely been followed, and ORRAF's present organizational structure is
satisfactory for current operations.
2.        About 76% of ORRAF's 1,543 staff members work in the provincial
offices. Staff remuneration compares favorably with Civil Service standards,
and this, plus the flexibility provided by promotions and transfers, has
helped greatly in the recruitment and retension of high quality staff. The
size and distribution of the staff are adequate to carry out ongoing programs
successfully.
3.        The training programs offered by ORRAF, both for its own staff and
for the rubber replanters are excellent. Regular technical training programs
are offered to development and extension staff involved in field operations,
while courses in management and administration are aimed at staff at
headquarters and in the provincial offices. Overseas scholarships and study
and observation tours have also been offered to qualified staff, with financ-
ing from a UNDP Bridging Project. In addition, ORRAF courses provided
through about 280 GMOs have trained about 6,500 smallholders in improved
processing techniques and bulk selling. With the exception of a recently
initiated coconut planting course for extension staff, all technical training
courses have been in rubber development.
Financial Position
4.        ORRAF has three sources of funds:  the rubber cess; interest income
on deposits; and subventions from Government which include Bank and CDC loans.
At the end of FY81, the total cash reserve available to ORRAF amounted to
about $26.1 million (B 600 million) (Table 1). The structure of the Fund is



- 51 -
ANNEX 2
Page 2
described in Table 2. Revenue from the replanting cess passes directly from
customs to ORRAF, which has been able to accumulate fairly large
reserves because actual replantings and disbursement of grants have been
slower than estimated. Due to the rapid accumulation of cash balances over
the past six years, interest income has also been fairly substantial,
amounting to about $3.7 million in FY81. This has been used mainly for
administrative expenses, and in FY81 covered about 30% of administrative
costs.
5.         ORRAF's present financial position is satisfactory for current
operations. The separation of administrative expenses from grant payments
is sound financial practice, and no change is envisioned in the near future.
Since the expansion of ORRAF's activities into rubber new planting, as
proposed under the project, would be limited to technical and economic
matters, no changes are required in ORRAF's financial structure for this
project, although a Government subvention to cover the costs of the
additional expenses incurred through the assumption of extra
responsibilities would be required.
6.         The attached tables provide details of ORRAF's financial position
and staffing.

SECOND TREE CROPS PROJECT
The Rubber Research Center (RRC)
1.        The Rubber Research Center (RRC) was established in 1965 in Hat Yai
as a branch of the DOA-s Rubber Division. RRC is responsible for conducting
research on all aspects of rubber cultivation, production and processing,
and dissemination of information among producers and processors.  It is the
national regulatory body for the Thai Tested Rubber (TTR) scheme and it
carries out specification testing for block rubber, while supervising the
testing laboratories of private manufactures of TTR rubber. The RRC
finances are provided by (a) 5% of the annual proceeds of the rubber cess;
and (b) budget allocations of the Rubber Division. The budget for 1978 and
1979 was in the order of $1.5 million per annum, about 30% being spent on
salaries and the balance on utilities and research.
2.        The RRC's Director, with a Deputy Director, heads two departments:
one for administration and one for technical development. The latter
comprises the following five divisions: Agronomy, Soil Science, Technology,
Economics and Development. The Development Division has three sections:
Field Services and Nurseries, Training, and Technical Services and
Demonstration. The organization is presented in Chart 22218.
3.        Each Division has only a limited number of Research Officers (RO).
Some of these ROs have been trained in scientific disciplines such as soil
science, plant pathology and agricultural economics. Extension services to
the smallholders are to be provided by ORRAF up to and including the first
year of tapping from FY82 onwards and the MOAC's Department of Agricultural
Extension (DAE) thereafter. The RRC provides only liaison in development
work and a limited amount of field development services to smallholders.
The RRC also:
(a) provides training courses and refresher courses for officers of the
DAE and ORRAF;
(b) provides training courses in bud grafting and tapping for small-
holders uho have completed replanting; and
(c) supervises the supply of planting material, by regular inspection
and licensing of official and commercial nurseries, that provide
budwood or budded stumps to rubber growers.
4.         In summary the RRC mainly directs its research work to solving the
following problems:



-58 -                               ANNEX 3
Page 2
(a) reducing the immature period of the rubber tree, as the long
nonproductive period is a disincentive to investment in the crop;
(b) increasing crop yields, by breeding high-yielding clones, by
better nutrition and disease control, improved tapping and
stimulation techniques and innovations in crop husbandry practices;
(c) improvements in the economics of production, transport, processing,
marketing and export of natural rubber (NR); and
(d) exploitation of the inherent unique qualities of NR and its
manipulation to obtain special types of NR with desirable
qualities, e.g., resistance to oxidation and oil.
5.        Priorities.  Research should be geared to the special requirements
of smallholders, who produce more than 90% of Thailand's rubber. The
techniques developed should be simple and effective. Although the
environmental and ecological conditions in Southern Thailand and in the
Northern parts of peninsular Malaysia are similar, it is important to carry
out independent research and test the majority of Malaysian research findings
under local conditions, before adopting them. Therefore, research at the RRC
should be concentrated on (a) breeding and selection, (b) field planting
techniques, (c) exploitation and stimulation, (d) nutrition and
(e) processing, as discussed below.
6.        Breeding and Selection.  Studies on breeding were discontinued in
1971, and since then, Indonesian and Malaysian clones have been recommended
for planting, without comprehensively testing them in Thailand. This policy
includes an element of risk as imported clones, although inherently high
yielding, may have undesirable characteristics such as susceptibility to
wind damage and diseases, under the conditions prevalent in Thailand, which
could make them unsuitable for local conditions. Therefore, a high priority
must be given to testing of imported clones and to breeding and selection.
The extension of rubber new planting into new areas in the Southeast and
possibly in the Northeast, with environmental conditions which substantially
differ from those in South Thailand, will entail the breeding of new clones,
adapted to those conditions.
7.        Field Planting.  The agronomic and economic aspects of land
preparation and field planting operations need further careful study,
because of their impact on the environment and on the period of immaturity.
The use of polybag budded stumps, at various stages of growth, should be
further studied, with special reference to the economics of production. The
use of high stumped buddings appears to be limited as this material does not
travel well, quite apart from the economics of their production and
distribution to smallholders, scattered over various areas of Thailand.

8.        Crown Budding.  Studies on the subject can be scaled down consid-
erably. The idea of crown budding itself appears to be a negative one,
discounting the possibilities of breeding clones resistant to leaf diseases.
It is encouraging to note that Brazil and Sri Lanka have recently made
sigificant headway in breeding high-yielding clones such as RRIC 121 and 131,
tolerant to South American Leaf Blight (SALB), a more virulant disease than
Phytophthora leaf disease.
9.        Intercropping.  The following studies are proposed:
(a) effects of intercropping on growth and yield of rubber in
different soils and environmental conditions;
(b) fertilizer requirements of intercrops in various locations;
(c) management and labor requirements for intercrops in combination
with rubber;
(d) pests and diseases of the intercrop, and any interaction of these
with rubber, the main crop;
(e) the ecological balance between intercrops and rubber, e.g.,
humidity effects and the action on predators and weeds;
(f) effect of row spacing on rubber and the intercrop;
(g) moisture relationships in the soil, with special reference to
dry periods;
(h) weeds and weed control, succession of weeds; and
(i) transport, marketing and economics of production of intercrops.
10.       Exploitation and Stimulation.  Research in this area should aim at
adjusting tapping cut lengths (from S/4 to S/1), frequency of tapping (from
d/l to d/6), up- and downward tapping and stimulation methods (above and
below cut, and on the groove), so as to enable a smallholder family to tap
its own holding without hired labor and obtain optimal income from rubber
cultivation. Further research should also be undertaken on new systems of
tapping such as puncture tapping, for more economic exploitation, especially
during periods of labor shortage.
11.       Nutrition.  Fertilizer recommendations are presently based largely
on the Malaysian experience. As in the case of breeding, this practice is
not advisable to be continued and RRC should step up its research on
nutrition and the economics involved, in order to give smallholders
appropriate advice based on local research findings. The RRC has
well-equipped analytical laboratories and some trained staff; it should
expand its studies on plant nutrition and aim at providing smallholders with



- 60-                                ANNEX 3
Page 4
fertilizer recommendations based on soil and foliar analyses. RRC has started
soil mapping in relation to fertilizer recommendations in the important
rubber growing areas; this program should be intensified and given priority.
12.       Processing.  The present market trends appear to favor the produc-
tion of Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS) over that of block rubbers as the invest-
ment costs for the latter are high, but the premia for them are insufficiently
attractive; the prices often being only comparable to or below those for RSSI.
Thailand sells a greater part of its rubber to Japan, and the Japanese
market is quite willing to buy the rubber in the form of RSS.  Therefore,
studies on the production of high quality sheet by smallholders must be
given priority and only the lower grades of rubber and scrap should be
processed into block rubber.
13.       New Types of NR.  The Rubber Technology Department of the RRC
is well equipped at present with a range of new equipment provided by the
Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The RRC is now giving
priority to studies on the production of modified rubbers for specific uses.
14.       Economics.  There are several aspects of exploitation, use of
stimulants, fertilizers, fungicides and herbicides, transport of latex,
processing, transport of dry rubber, marketing and shipment, that must be
studied, in order to ensure that the Thai rubber industry reaps the full
benefits from this crop. A start has been made on some of these problems,
but a great deal more requires to be done. Therefore, studies on those
problems should be started as soon as possible.
15.       Strengthening RRC.  Considering the volume of research work that is
being done and has to be undertaken, it is necessary to increase the staff
and facilities of the RRC considerably. The training and development of a
local research capability would be the key feature of the research component
of the proposed project. The present training provided to research staff is
considered weak, and several research officers require additional scientific
training at post-graduate level in critical areas to design and carry out
appropriate experimentation more effectively. Therefore, priority must be
given to postgraduate training in the agronomy, soils science and technology
disciplines to strengthen RRCs research capability.
16.       RRC Funding.  The essence of research is to formulate ideas and
recommendations based on experimental findings and therefore it is deemed
necessary having RRC conduct its experiments independently, with adequate
funds, so that it can express independent views without owing any special
allegiance to any particular Department. Therefore, careful consideration
should be given, whether the present system of providing 5% of the cess
proceeds with additional Government subventions to RRC is the most optimal
method of funding research.  It is strongly recommended that rubber research
be funded by a special research cess on rubber exports, as done in Malaysia
and Sri Lanka.
17.       Indicative cost estimates for the rubber research component are
detailed in Annex 4, Tables 7 and 8.

SECOND TREE CROPS PROJECT
Bases for Economic and Financial Analysis
Definition of the Project for Purposes of the Economic Analysis
1.        For the purposes of economic analysis the "with project" situation
is considered to include (a) the completion of the ORRAF replantings presently
in the immature stage, including those initiated under the Rubber Replanting
Project (Loan 1243-TH); and (b) new ORRAF programs including the replanting of
an additional 200,000 ha started during the project.
2.        In the base case "without project" situation, it is assumed that
ORRAF would adequately fulfill its present obligations by completing the
planting on all areas started prior to the project period, but that it would
not undertake any new replanting. In that the proposed project is defined as
being to support ORRAF's new program 1982-85 it is most appropriately analyzed
by considering the returns to the entire new program even though a reduced new
program may have been possible without the support of a specific project.
3.        Under these circumstances, i.e., no new ORRAF replanting "without
project", it is expected that some of the 200,000 ha of old rubber which would
not be replanted by ORRAF without the project would be replanted, albeit at a
lower rate, using farmers' own resources, and that some would be abandoned.
Based on an analysis of historical replanting rates prior to the initiation of
ORRAF, consideration of Thai rubber farmers' access to alternative capital
sources, and the financial rates of return from replanting without any gratnt,
it is estimated that "without project" replanting would take place at a rate
of 2,500 ha per year for an 8-year period. That is, a total of 20,000 ha, or
10% of the area, would be replanted using farmers own resources "without
project." Of the other 180,000 ha of land which would not be replanted
"without project," some would continue to be tapped regularly, some would
occasionally be tapped and some would be abandoned. The aggregate "without
project" activity on this land is considered as being the equivalent of 60% of
the area being fully tapped for a further 9 years with yields declining from
425 kg to 250 kg/ha DRC. Details of land use, with and without project are
given in Table 1.



- 73 -                            ANNEX 5
Page 2
4.        As the proposed project covers a 4-year time slice of a
replanting program, yet the total time that an individual rubber plot is
under replanting is about 6 years, it is not possible to define specific
plots or areas of rubber Which are fully replanted using project funds.  In
order to estimate the effect of the project investment in replanting
therefore, a "fully replanted equivalent area" equal to the areas which are
partially covered by the project has been calculated by dividing the base
cost of "New Starts ($114.7 million)" plus "Continuation and Completion of
Ongoing Programs, ($115.9 million)" by the average base cost of replanting one
hectare of rubber ($1,453). Using this methodology, the project would have
an effect equivalent to completely replanting about 155,000 ha of rubber.
Derivation of Economic Prices
5.        Project output prices for rubber are based on the Bank's commodity
price projections for 1980-85 and 1990 expressed in mid-1981 constant
dollars, adjusted for international freight, local marketing costs, and
quality differentials. Details of rubber price calculations are given in
Tables 2 and 3. Fertilizer prices are also based on the Bank's commodity
price projections for 1980-85 and 1990.  They have been calculated on the
basis that "straights" are imported and manufactured into compound fertili-
zers in Thailand. Details of economic fertilizer price calculations are
given in Tables 4 and 5. Other prices are based on present financial levels
inflated to mid-1981 constant currency values using inflation factors shown
in Table 6. The prices of some components of the cost of individual items
are modified by conversion factors to adjust for local taxation. Specific
conversion factors used in these calculations are detailed in the Project File.
6.        In peninsular Thailand there is a relatively free market in labor
and adequate employment opportunities. Although the economic output values
of some farm products, specifically rubber and rice, are above their finan-
cial prices, it is felt that labor is reasonably mobile between different
types of agriculture and other industries. Consequently in the base case
for project evaluation the financial wage rate is taken to be the economic
wage rate in 1981. However, in view of the rapid growth of the economy (past
and projected) real wages are expected to increase over time, at 3% p.a.
during 1981-88 and 5% p.a. during 1989-95. Project labor requirements have
been estimated at present levels of technology, thus the economic cost of
labor would be expected to increase over time.  In the base case an annual
increase of 3% during 1981-95 is used. This would imply productivity gains
of about 2% p.a. during 1989-95.
Analysis Undertaken
7.        The economic analysis of the project has been done both by
examining, on a per hectare basis, the economic effect of the different
project subcomponents and also by making a detailed analysis including
sensitivity tests on the entire ORRAF new program, 1982-85.

The weighted average rate of return ("with project" less "without project")
of these project components is the ERR for the project. It is estimated at
15%.
Cost and Benefits Streams for Rubber Replanting
10.       The sensitivity of the project to changes in various economic
parameters is assessed on the basis of analysis of the rubber replanting
component. Benefits in this analysis are considered as the total value of
incremental rubber production of the ORRAF FY82-85 new program, i.e., the
incremental quantities/i produced multiplied by the economic prices.
Economic costs include the incremental costs of rubber development/2 (new
replanting) and the incremental operating costs of ORRAF attributable to this
development. As ORRAF is a large organization and has been able to plan its
expansion well in advance of project implementation, it is assumed that ORRAF
marginal costs per dollar of grant distributed to the incremental area under
the project is equal to its average operating costs per dollar of grant paid,
i.e. ORRAF costs of administering the grant are equal to about 20% of the
grant itself.
11.       Aggregated economic benefits and cost streams are listed in
Table 8, The sensitivity analysis based on variations of these main benefit
and cost streams is presented in Table 9 and switching values under
different opportunity costs of capital assumptions are shown in Table 10.
12.       The impact of the program on employment in the agricultural sector
is presented in Table 11 and details of the fiscal impact are presented in
Table 12.
Institutional Support
13.       The project costs attributable to strengthening the RRC, OAE and
LDD which amount in total to about 1% of the project cost have been excluded
from the economic analysis. Had these items been included as part of the
project costs, then the estimated benefits from them would have to have been
considered as project benefits. By excluding them both as costs and benefits
it is implicity assumed that the benefits from research and institution
building are equal to costs when discounted at the project economic rate of
return (ERR).
