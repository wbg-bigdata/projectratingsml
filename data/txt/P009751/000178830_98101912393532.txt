INDIA
A RAILWAY MODERNIZATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Economic Setting and Transport Sector
1.01      India covers an area of about 3.3 million square kilometers and
includes parts of the Himalayan mountain system, the Indo-Gangetic plain,
and the Deccan plateau of peninsular India. Total population is about 620
million with 21% living in urban areas and the remainder in small villages
concentrated in the Indo-Gangetic plain, in the basins and deltas of other
main river systems, and along the coast. The principal centers of population
and economic activity are Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi and Madras. Other main
centers are Hyderabad, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Kanpur. The main coal and
iron ore deposits are found in the eastern part of the Gangetic plain, where
also the majority of steel manufacturing and heavy engineering industries
are located.
1.02      Deliberate government policy, combined with the concentration of
manufacturing and trading activities in a limited rnumber of centers and the
dispersal of the majority of the population in a large number of small vil-
lages, has resulted in rail and road transport becoming the dominant modes
of transport, with the railway system providing mainly trunk services and
the highway system functioning mainly as a feeder system to the railways.
1.03      The roles of the various transport modes in India's motorized
traffic in 1965 and 1975 are indicated below. RaiL and air traffic include
revenue traffic only. For other modes of transport, the data are rough
estimates, but suffice to indicate the main features of the system. All
figures are rounded to the nearest billion.
Billion Ton-km    Billion Pass-km       Annual Growth %
Mode     1965/66    1975/76  1965/66   1975/76   Ton-km   Pass-km
Rail        99        135         96        149       3.2       4.5
Road        34         75         82        184       8.2       8.4
Other        12        12          2          2       0.0       0.0
Total   145        222        180       335        4.4       6.5

Agricultural and mining products account for an estimated 70% of the total
freight transport volume. A large part of agricultural production and most
mining freight and manufacturing production has origin or destination in
Northern India with its concentration of population and heavy industries.
The majority of imports are channelled through Bombay, Calcutta and Madras.
1.04      The railways have traditionally been the main mode of motorized
transport in India and retained their relative position more or less unchanged
up to the beginning of the 1950's, when the railway share of motorized land
transport was estimated at 90% of total ton-km and 75% of total pass-km. Over
the following two decades, highway freight and passenger transport increased
rapidly while the railways' share declined to 60% of total freight traffic
and 45% of total passenger traffic, with a corresponding increase in the
share of road transport. In respect of freight, this development was due to
the increasing market for high-value goods moving over short and medium dis-
tances, where highway transport has inherent advantages over railway transport.
In respect of passenger traffic, the main reason for the reduced railway share
is that long-distance passenger traffic has tended to increase at a slower
rate than short-distance commuter traffic, which can generally be carried more
economically by road, and the railways also have made some efforts through
tariff policy to promote diversion of this traffic to road. With continued
urban growth, the passenger share of road transport relative to railway
transport can be expected to increase.
1.05      Compared with railways and highway transport, the other modes of
transport are at present of minor importance as general goods and passenger
carriers: coastal shipping and pipelines each carry about 3% of the total
freight traffic in terms of ton-km; air transport carries about 1% of total
pass-km. These modes are, however, important within their specialized areas,
and there is scope for considerable expansion within each mode because of the
size of the country and its geographical features. Consequently, projects for
expansion of coastal shipping of coal and pipelines for transport of crude oil,
gas and petroleum products are currently being undertaken by the Government.
B. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.06      Railway planning, construction and operation is the responsibility
of Indian Railways (IR) under the Ministry of Railways. Civil aviation is
under the authority of the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation; pipelines
are under the authority of the Ministry of Petroleum; and roads, ports and
shipping are the responsibility of the Ministry of Shipping and Transport.
Transport planning and coordination is undertaken centrally and at the
regional level within the context of overall national planning and state
planning, respectively. On the basis of the overall targets for the transport
sector, the appropriate ministry prepares a five-year plan. A study group in
the Planning Commission, assisted by UNDP-financed experts, is preparing a
framework for overall transport planning and coordination in India. The work



of the study group is divided into three phases: (i) preparation of a guide-
line paper on short-term transport policy for the country; (ii) preparation of
contributing policy papers and advice on specific issues and problems arising
in the formulation of transport policy for the Five-Year Plan 1978/79 to
1982/83; and (iii) establishment of a comprehensive transport planning model
for the country. The first phase was completed early 1978 and dealt with
such issues as development of rural roads in the context of GOI's new emphasis
on rural development; policy on new railway lines; urban transport policy
with particular reference to the major metropolitan areas; and port plan-
ning with particular reference to the construction of the proposed Neva Sheva
port near Bombay. The next two phases are in progress. The work of the study
group is expected to be completed by early 1979.
1.07      India's long-term policy for the transport sector aims at the fur-
ther development of a transport system which can meet, at minimum cost, the
increased transport demand resulting from the growth in the economy. This
policy would be implemented through increased support of the highway sector
and encouragement of increased efficiency of railway transport operations.
These objectives are reflected in the five-year plan through projects for
improvement of the main highway network and construction of feeder and second-
ary roads; increased supplies of automotive vehicles for the road transport
sector; and modernization of railway manufacturing units and workshops. The
proposed project will assist IR in modernization of its railway motive power
fleet and workshop system.
1.08      The Government's current economic objectives are incorporated into
the Five-Year Plan 1978/79 to 1982/83. The Plan represents an attempt at
realizing high average growth in the economy by increasing emphasis on agri-
culture, small-scale industry, power, and transport and distribution. Of
the total public investment in the Five-Year Plan, Rs 81.3 billion or 14%
would be allocated to transportation, and about 40% of these investments
would be for railway investments. In view of anticipated railway traffic
over the next five years, the Plan allocation to the railway sector can be
considered adequate.
C. Manufacture of Railway Equipment
1.09      In addition to its role as a major transporter of freight and pas-
sengers, IR is also India's only manufacturer of diesel and electric locomo-
tives and its most important manufacturer of passenger stock. As the prin-
cipal buyer of wagons, wheels, tires and axles and a major buyer of electrical
and mechanical goods and steel products for its manufacturing units, IR has
an important impact on the economic performance of these industries.
1.10      IR's manufacturing and procurement planning is undertaken in
connection with the annual budget. Tenders and firm orders are issued to
captive and single-source suppliers for each budget year, and indicative
orders for four years thereafter. The indicative orders are updated, and
delivery schedules within the budget year are revised by agreement between



-4-
IR and the relevant suppliers. IR is aware of the adverse effects of frequent
or substantial changes in its procurement program and tries to minimize such
changes.
1.11      At present IR can build annually 150 diesel-electric locomotives
and power packs, 60 electric locomotives, and 50 diesel-hydraulic shunting
locomotives. Steam locomotives are no longer produced. Average capacity
utilization in recent years has been 70% and is expected to reach 100% at
the existing manufacturing units in the early 1980's. The capacity for the
manufacture and remanufacture of parts and components for maintenance is
becoming increasingly inadequate. The proposed project would support expan-
sion of this capacity as well as the import of parts and components to bridge
the gap until adequate manufacturing capacity has been installed.
1.12      Total passenger stock manufacturing capacity in India is currently
about 1,550 units per year of which IR's capacity amounts to 750, with two
other companies, one in the private and one in the public sector, accounting
for the remainder. Capacity utilization is currently about 85% and is expec-
ted to reach 100% in the early 1980's.
1.13      Total annual wagon manufacturing capacity in India is about 30,000
four-wheeler units shared by nine private and public sector ,companies. IR
workshops manufacture a few special purpose wagons. Current demand is about
10,000-15,000 wagon units annually. With expected orders increasing to only
about 20,000 in the early 1980's, GOI is aware of the need to assist the
industry in converting manufacturing capacity to other uses; and the industry
itself is studying various diversification schemes.
1.14      The two most important manufacturers of electrical goods for diesel-
electric and electric locomotives are the public sector undertaking, Bharat
Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) and IR's Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW).
Installed capacity at BHEL for manufacture of equipment relevant to IR is cur-
rently 1,300 traction motors for diesel-electric locomotives, 220 traction
transformers, and 100 blower motors. Capacity at CLW amounts to 400-500 trac--
tion motors for electric locomotives. Utilization of capacity is directly
connected with IR's locomotive manufacturing program and fluctuates accord-
ingly. During the latest three years, capacity utilization at BHEL has been
about 55% for traction motors, 66% for control gear, 50% for transformers and
75% for blower motors. Alternative applications for BHEL traction motors and
associated equipment are being explored in oil drilling and other similar
areas. Capacity utilization at CLW has been about 70% in recent years.
1.15      There are currently two indigenous manufacturers of wheels, axles
and tires: Durgapur Steel Plant (DSP) at Durgapur, and Tata Iron and Steel
Company (TISCO) at Jamshedpur. DSP wheel and axle plant is part of an inte-
grated steel plant and is a public sector undertaking controlled by the Steel
Authority of India Limited which is a holding company for public sector steel
plants. TISCO wheel, axle and tire plant is also part of an integrated steel
plant and is a private sector undertaking. Since both wheel and axle plants
are parts of integrated steel plants, any dislocation in supply of gas, inputs
or blooms, either due to breakdown or labor unrest in coke ovens, blast fur-
naces, steel-melting shops or blooming mills will affect their output. DSP
and TISCO production is shown in Table 1.



1.16      The DSP wheel and axle plant is 15 years old, and certain equipment
requires replacement. DSP manufactures wheels, axles and wheelsets, but not
tires. Wheels and axles are forged. Axle forging technology is by pneumatic
hammers and is not well suited for the production of a large product mix in
small quantities. DSP cannot forge axles for the heavier types of traction
equipment being acquired by IR.  Current rated capacity of DSP is 80,000
wheels and 40,000 axles. The highest output ever attained, however, was
48,000 wheels and 24,000 axles, and capacity utilization during the past ten
years has been about 30% of capacity.  A number of Government commissions have
looked into the problem. The latest of these, chaired by the Secretary of
Steel, in December 1976, attributed poor capacity utilization to very poor
labor relations; frequent rejections due to lack of quality steel and quality
consciousness on the part of workers; delays due to equipment breakdowns; and
an unsatisfactory worker/management incentive scheme. The commission con-
cluded that, if the situation were remedied, full utilization of present rated
capacity could be achieved by 1980/81. DSP is currently engaged in a produc-
tivity improvement program with a view to achieving this target. However,
consultants' estimates indicated that long-term utilization of current rated
capacity of the DSP wheel and axle plant is unlikely to exceed 75%. The com-
mission also recommended that capacity at DSP be expanded to 100,000 wheels
and 50,000 axles and that the expansion be phased in such a manner that
additional facilities be ready to go into production when DSP has achieved
full utilization of present rated capacity. No further expansion of DSP
wheel and axle plant was considered by the commission.
1.17      The TISCO wheel, tire and axle plant is 35 years old.  Plant and
machinery was originally acquired secondhand and has now outlived its utility.
TISCO does not have any scope for further physical expansion, and management
is not interested in investing in a new wheel and axle manufacturing facility
that would become captive of IR. Considering plant age and equipment condi-
tion, production capability of this plant is likely to decline in the absence
of any management plans for replacement or expansion. Current rated capacity
is 7,900 wheels, 27,500 tires and 9,500 axles. Capacity utilization has been
about 100% during the past 10 years.
1.18      The prime consumer of wheels, axles and tires is IR who represent
more than 90% of domestic demand; additional small amounts are required by
the steel plants, the Heavy Engineering Corporation at Ranchi and the Port
Commissioners. The requirements of IR are worked out every year in August,
one year in advance, in coordination with DSP and TISCO. The shortfall is
planned for import. Current installed capacity at DSP and TISCO covers only
about 60% of demand for wheels/tires and about 85% of demand for axles, and
the Government has sanctioned the construction by IR of a wheel and axle plant
in Karnataka State to cover the shortfall in domestic manufacturing capacity.
The proposed project would support the construction of this plant.
1.19      The transfer prices paid by IR to its own manufacturing units cover
total manufacturing costs, including direct and indirect labor, materials,
overheads and depreciation at replacement cost. Since these units are depart-
mental, any profits from their operations rever-t to IR on a continuing basis.



-6-
A number of major items, such as wheels, axles, wagons, etc. are procured by
IR on negotiated basis from domestic suppliers. Price setting for such con-
tracts are carried out between IR and the individual major suppliers with
the involvement of other government agencies as well as manufacturers' asso-
ciations where they exist. The negotiated prices are to cover total manufac-
turing costs plus a profit margin. However, the prices are renegotiated
from time to time and in some instances such as for wheels and axles are lag-
ging two to three years behind. Consequently, current prices in effect may
provide little or no profit and on certain items may not even cover total
manufacturing costs. Also the principles on which pricing of items such as
wheels and axles are based have been disputed by the suppliers. Consequently,
a review of wheels and axles pricing is underway by the Chief Cost and Accounts
Officer, Ministry of Finance in order to establish a fair and equitable formula
to resolve the issues in question. This review for wheels and axles will be
completed very shortly and the principles evolved from it could be extended to
other products acquired by IR through negotiated contracts, such as wagons.
1.20      The main export markets for Indian railway products are in Middle
Eastern Countries, South East Asia, and East and West Africa. Exports are
normally undertaken with the assistance of, or through, canalizing agencies.
Thus, wagons, coaches and locomotives are handled by the Projects and Equip-
ment Corporation under the State Trading Corporation. Exports of steel
products, such as rail, are handled by the Steel Authority of India. Recent
exports include wagons to Yugoslavia, Malaysia and East African countries;
locomotives to Tanzania; and coaches to the Philippines and East African
Railways. Some repeat orders have been obtained, suggesting that quality
and reliability of the Indian products have been adequate.
II. INDIAN RAILWAYS
A.   Organization, Management and  Staff
2.01      The IR network is owned and managed by GOI.  Its operations are
controlled and directed by a Board of five members headed by a Chairman who
is ex-officio a Principal Secretary to the Government of India reporting to
the Minister of Railways. One Board member, the Financial Commissioner, has
discretionary powers to report directly to the Minister of Finance on financial
matters. The Board, therefore, performs the dual functions of a Secretariat
to the Ministry of Railways and of an executive body responsible for railway
operations. In financial matters GOI, through Parliament, oversees implemen-
tation of recommendations made by the Railway Convention Committee and other
parliamentary committees.
2.02      The IR is the nation's largest single undertaking with an investment
of some Rs 55.7 billion (US$6.5 billion equivalent) and a total staff strength
of about 1.7 million. There are nine Zonal Railways, each of which is under
the control of a General Manager, and each zone is a large system on its own
account. IR also has three factories engaged in the manufacture of locomotives
and rolling stock. IR's organization is illustrated in Chart IBRD 18812.



2.03      The quality of senior staff at Headquarters and in the Zonal
Railways is high and their knowledge of management techniques and modern
railway technology is good.
2.04      There are two recognized staff federations covering about 70% of all
staff. During the latter part of 1973 and the first half of 1974 there was a
succession of strikes and disputes, in consequence of which the IR Board took
a number of steps to strengthen its personnel branch and welfare inspectorate
and to improve career development. IR is now increasingly effective in
handling labor relations.
B. Training
2.05      Training of staff is given high priority and is considered crucial
by IR management in maintaining a high standard of operations, staff develop-
ment and in keeping abreast of rapid technological changes. Therefore, a number
of personnel categories are trained at the recruitment stage; others are given
refresher courses, and certain staff members are given special training at the
time they are considered for promotion. The training for particular jobs is
done in the field and at Zonal Training Schools in each zone. All schools have
well equipped facilities. In 1975/76 about 16,000 received initial training,
38,000 attended the refresher courses, and 17,000 underwent courses for
possible promotions.
2.06       In addition to the Zonal Training Schools, there are four Central
Training Institutes where IR offers courses to its own personnel as well as to
personnel from African and Asian railways: Sudan, Korea, Zambia and Nigeria.
C. Infrastructure
2.07       IR operates over 60,000 route-km, of which about 12,000 km have
multiple track. IR's trackage is shown below by gauge and category (in km):
Running                        Workshops
Gauge          Track    Sidings   Yards    and Sheds          Total
Broad         43,743    13,654    3,965         1,899       63,261
Meter         26,815      6,177       882         887       34,761
Narrow         4,281        457        12          65        4,815
Total       74,839    20,288    4,859        2,851      102,837
About 62% of total track is broad gauge (BG), 34% is meter gauge (MG), and
the remaining 4% is narrow gauge (NG). About 15% of BG and 1% of MG track
are electrified. Of total BG running track, 24,000 km or 10,000 route km
constitutes the heavy-density lines over which average traffic density
exceeds 20 million gross ton-km per year.

D. Motive Power
2.08      In the 1960's, IR began manufacturing diesel-electric, diesel-
hydraulic, AC and DC electric locomotives in order to reduce dependence
on steam traction and reduce foreign exchange requirements for motive power
modernization. At DLW the diesel-electric locomotive manufacture was set up
in collaboration with ALCO, United States; at CLW the diesel-hydraulic loco-
motive manufacture was set up in collaboration with MAK, Federal Republic of
Germany, and the AC electric locomotive manufacture in collaboration with the
50 Hz Group (France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium). At CLW, IR also manu-
factures DC electric locomotives for replacement of limited DC traction around
Bombay which is the oldest electrified section of the Railways.
2.09      In March 1977, there were 2,025 diesel-electric and diesel-hydraulic
locomotives, 844 electric locomotives, and 8,293 steam locomotives operating on
IR.  Details of type and age group of IR's traction fleet are shown in Table 2.
The traction policy regarding conversion from steam to diesel and electric
traction was re-examined by IR after the oil price increases in 1973/74. It
concluded that there should not be any significant changes in traction policy,
although electrification in relative terms has become slightly more economical.
In order to obtain maximum benefits from electrification, however, it is
essential to improve performance of AC electric locomotives and reduce their
operating and maintenance costs which at present are higher than those of
the comparable main line diesel-electric locomotive.
2.10      Since the acquisition of designs and start up of manufacture of
locomotives in India, considerable improvements and innovations have taken
place in diesel and electric traction technology, which have resulted in re-
ducing manufacturing, operation and maintenance costs and improved operating
performance. These improvements have yet to be incorporated into locomotives
manufactured by IR.
2.11      The present-design AC electric locomotive manufactured in India,
WAM4, was derived by RDSO from an Alstohm design of the 50 Hz Group and is
approximately 27 years old. The only major change made to the design was
replacement of the original mono-motor bogie by the 3-axle bogie with axle-
hung motors of the WDM2 diesel-electric locomotive manufactured by IR. When
the locomotive was first introduced, there were numerous performance problems,
most of which still persist. Although problems of the traction motors have
been gradually eliminated, the electrical controls and transformer still are
not able to provide adequate power for the motors. Obsolescence of WAM4 de-
sign and features has resulted in lower availability and higher costs than
experienced in modern electric locomotives used by other railways. In addi-
tion, WAM4 does not provide sufficient operational versatility required by
varied IR train operation requirements to allow full utilization of electri-
fied routes. The project would support the acquisition of thyristor control/
transformer sets on a trial basis for the improvement of the electric loco-
motive fleet.



2.12      The standard main line diesel-electric locomotive manufactured by
IR is WDM2, which is a 16-cylinder, 6-axle BG mixed traffic locomotive rated
at 2600 gross/2400 net hp.  There are two other versions of this locomotive
built for main line MG service and heavy-duty BG shunting:  YDM4 and WDM6.
WDM2 manufacture began in India in 1964 in collaboration with ALCO, United
States, and the design is about 22 years old.  WDM2 has an acceptable operat-
ing and maintenance performance and is the prime mover of IR's rapidly growing
freight traffic. However, IR will benefit substantially from introducing
into the present and future WDM2 fleet technology developed since the present
designs were acquired. The proposed project would support the development
of improved parts and components for improving performance of WDM2.
2.13      In addition to needed technological improvements to IR's present-
design locomotives, improvement in Railways' operation requires adoption
of traction technology specifically suited to the variety of operating
conditions prevailing in India. An assesement of Railways' motive-power
requirements; the power plan study, has been underway since October 1977 by
a committee established for this purpose. This study would cover the numbers
and horsepower ranges of locomotives required for different applications, the
extent of various applications on different routes and sections of lines, and
an economic cost/benefit analysis of the various alternatives. In assessing
the implications for electric energy requirements of alternative solutions,
the power plan study would be coordinated with another study now underway of
Railway electrification and dieselization, with the participation of a UNDP
expert and the Planning Commission. The initial phase of the power plan study
has demonstrated considerable potential for improving IR's motive power fleet
through the introduction of modern and proven traction technologies, some of
which are described in the following paragraphs. During the negotiations, it
was confirmed that the Association would be kept advised of the motive power
study's progress and results as soon as these were available.
2.14      The major industrial center and port of Bombay are connected to the
rest of the IR network by two 1500 V DC electrified lines. These two lines
are Bombay-Igatpuri on the northeast section and Bombay-Pune on the southeast
section. The northeast approach to Bombay includes a heavy-graded 14 km ghat
section of 1 in 37 (uncompensated) and a 67 km hilly section with a gradient
of 1 in 87.5 (compensated). The southeast approach has a 28 km ghat section
with a gradient of 1 in 37 (uncompensated). The present classes of locomotives
manufactured by IR and used on the ghat sections have proved unsatisfactory
for the specific requirements of banking duties, causing frequent wheel slips,
stalls and partings of trains. In addition, due to inadequate capability of
existing locomotives, the train load limits on the DC graded sections are
lower than load limits on adjacent AC electrified sections. Thus, the train
loads have to be reduced prior to entering the DC ghat sections. As a result,
operating costs and line-capacity utilization are adversely affected indicating
a need for special duty DC electric banking locomotives for these sections.
2.15      The power plan study indicates a need for about 240 4,000 hp
4-axle AC electric locomotives to supplement the WAM4 for mixed traffic
applications. The motive power plan study also indicates the need for a



- 10 -
limited number of 3,500-4,000 hp diesel-electric locomotives for increasing
train-load and speed of passenger trains and operating heavy 4,500 ton unit
freight trains. The alternative of using two WDM2 in double heading, being
used at present, is operationally and economically unsatisfactory. Also,
consideration was given to increase the horsepower of present WDM2; but this
task would require considerable time and cost without assurance of successful
results. At the same time, high-horsepower locomotives have been in use and
proven elsewhere for many years.
E. Rolling Stock
2.16      At present, the passenger stock includes 10 diesel rail cars; 2,332
electric multiple units (EMU) and 34,380 coaches. Details of passenger stock
and their age group are given in Table 2. The present fleet of freight wagons
is about 397,000 units or 529,000 in terms of 4-wheeler wagons. Almost all
iron ore traffic and most coal traffic is hauled by unit trains with bogie
wagons. Details of IR's freight-wagon fleet by type and age group are given
in Table 2.
F. Workshops
2.17      IR's maintenance workshops were set up and equipped in the latter
half of the nineteenth and early twentieth century by the then State and
Company Railways. At the time of integration of the Railways in 1952, there
were 41 workshops dealing with the overhaul of rolling stock and motive power.
The size of these workshops varied from 150 to 15,000 employees. The workload
and product mix in these units were governed by the need for self-sufficiency
of each individual State/Company Railway resulting in a proliferation of
diverse activities for different types of rolling stock in individual work-
shops.
2.18      The last 25 years of planned development on the IR has brought about
extensive changes in the mode of traction from steam to diesel and electric.
About 2,500 diesel and electric locomotives introduced since 1960 now carry
about 80% of the total freight traffic. During the same period, the number
of freight wagons in the fleet has grown two and a half times and the number
of passenger stock has doubled. In addition, about 8,300 steam locomotives
are still in service (Table 2).
2.19      While workshops mainly undertake periodical (programmed) overhauls
and manufacture and remanufacture of parts and components, running repairs
are performed in a large number of locomotive sheds and carriage and wagon
depots dispersed throughout the country. These small repair units so far
have been provided with limited machinery and plant, mainly through transfer
of old machines from workshops.



- 11 -
2.20      In spite of substantial increases in equipment holdings, complexity
of technology and diversity of product mix since integration, IR's investment
in workshops has been considerably lower than that required to maintain a
proper maintenance level. In the past 22 years, investment in workshops has
averaged only 3.5% of the investment made in rolling stock and motive power
(Table 3). Of the investment made in workshops and machinery in the past 22
years, about 45% has been exclusively for the manufacturing units: DLW, CLW
and ICF. A 1977 detailed survey showed that of a t:otal 24,546 machines, 77%
of the machinery and plant in mechanical workshops, 53% in production units,
and 46% in diesel and electric locomotive sheds and repair lines are over 15
years old (Table 4). The gap between maintenance facilities and requirements
has been widening rapidly. At the same time, the level of parts and components
available for maintenance in the past has been considerably lower than required
by the Railways. The result has been low out-turn and quality of maintenance,
low availability of equipment, and increase in ineffective motive power and
rolling stock. This situation is expected to deteriorate further and more
rapidly than in the past because a large percentage of Railways' rolling stock
and motive power is reaching the age group for which heavy repair and overhaul
are required. The projected motive power and rolling stock ineffectives in
1977 and 1981 and the additional costs thereof are shown below (for broad gauge
only):
Capital Cost
Fleet             Ineffectives             of Increment
Item             1977   1981    1977    1981    Increment    Rs million

Locomotives    1,468   1,738    17%        23%        150           675
Electric
Locomotives       824      984    21%      27%         93          418

Coaches          19,445  21,595    12%       18%     1,554           777
Wagons          404,313 434,113      4%       5%     5,533            830
The total capital cost of a four-year increase in ineffectives thus amounts
to Rs 2,932 million or an annual incremental capital cost of Rs 733 million
if there is no improvement in workshop performance.
2.21      The proposed workshop modernization would change the principle of
self-sufficiency for each Zonal Railway to that of maximum efficiency through
work specialization and other measures for the total network. Accordingly,
modernization will be carried out based on a four-region maintenance network
based on type of equipment and IR's operational and traffic requirements.
The manufacturing and remanufacturing of major parts and components will be
limited to two existing manufacturing units (CLW and DLW), one workshop pres-
ently being modernized (Golden Rock), and one new facility to be constructed
in the future. During negotiations, a plan of action was drawn-up and it
was confirmed that IR would make appropriate organizational arrangements for
implementing and monitoring implementation and coordination of the Workshop



- 12 -
Modernization program both by the Board and the nine Zonal railways.  IR
further advised that they would make available to the Association the proposed
organizational arrangements by September 1978. The proposed project would
support the implementation of workshop modernization and rationalization, and
includes parts and components for establishing a unit exchange maintenance
system.
G. Manufacturing Units
2.22      IR's main manufacturing units are the Chitteranjan Locomotive Works
(CLW) at Chitteranjan, the Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) at Varanasi, and the
Integral Coach Factory (ICF) at Madras. The CLW was set up in 1950/51 for the
manufacture of steam locomotives. Production in this shop was diversified in
the mid-1960's, and by 1972 this unit had switched entirely to the manufacture
of electric locomotives, diesel hydraulic shunters and a variety of components
for diesel-electric locomotives and other equipment. The ICF commenced pro-
duction of coaches in 1955/56 and later added electric multiple units to its
product line. The DLW began production of diesel-electric locomotives in
1964/65. A large proportion of the original equipment installed in the three
production units has already served its useful economic life.
2.23      In addition to overaged and obsolete machinery and some layout handi-
caps, evaluation of IR's manufacturing units showed that there was considerable
room for improving manufacturing practices and product design to reduce manufac-
turing costs and improve product quality. A program to achieve this began in
September 1977 and has already produced considerable results. Full implement-
ation will be achieved under the proposed project, which will support the
acquisition of modern plant and machinery for CLW and needed rationalization
at DLW.
H. Wheel, Axle and Tire Supply
2.24      Based on the traffic projections in the IR Corporate Plan (para.
2.42) as well as the assessment of the annual rolling stock maintenance and
production requirements the estimated requirements of wheels, tires and axles
by 1985/86 are shown below together with the total current rated manufacturing
capacity for these products in DSP and TISCO (in units):
Estimated
Estimated      Production Capacity        Capacity
Item        Demand          DSP        TISCO         Balance
Wheels       140,280      80,000        7,900         -52,380
Tires         27,500           0       27,500               0
Axles         50,680      40,000        9,560         - 1,120



- 13 -
IR has adopted the concept of solid wheels for carriages and wagons because
of better wear resistance than tyred wheels, leaving steam-locomotive wheels
and EMU wheels for retireing and is currently in the process of implementing
this policy. The remaining tire demand for steam locomotives will enable full
utilization of existing capacity in TISCO for tire manufacture. Currently,
about 50% of estimated demand for wheels, about 30% of demand for axles and
100% of demand for tires is for maintenance. The share of wheel and axle
demand for maintenance is expected to increase to about 60% over the coming
decade due to the age structure of the motive power and rolling stock fleet.
2.25      The proposed project will support the establishment of a wheel and
axle plant operated by IR (IRWA) with a production capacity of 70,000 wheels
and 23,000 axles. Assuming average plant utilization rates of about 90% for
wheels, about 100% for tires and about 70% for axles, the work distribution
for the three plants by 1985/86 is projected as follows (in units):
Estimated
Estimated            Estimated Production          Production
Item        Demand         DSP         TISCO         IRWA       Balance
Wheels      140,280       72,000       7,100        63,000      +1,820
Tyres         27,500            0     27,500              0          0
Axles         50,680      28,000       6,700        16,100      +  120
The possible surplus in wheel production is expected to be absorbed through
exports from DSP and TISCO, which have both proved competitive in the inter-
national market for these products. The possible surplus in axle production
is expected to be exported and eventually absorbed by IR replacements and
additions by the late 1980's. Also IRWA could cover some or all of the
shortfall that would arise if DSP and TISCO for some reason would not be
able to fully realise their production potential. The country's wheel and
axle demand/supply balance 1977/78 to 1985/86 is shown in Table 5.
2.26      The product mix in the IRWA plant was planned taking into account
the number of product types currently being produced in the existing steel
plants, DSP and TISCO, as follows (in number of types):
IR
Item      DSP      TISCO      Workshops    IRWA    Total
Wheels     12          1         8            5      21
Tyres       0         48         0            0      48
Axles        7        36         0           57      96
Some duplication in the manufacture of wheel and axle types is envisioned in
the beginning when DSP and TISCO will manufacture locomotive, coach, and EMU
wagon wheels, and IRWA wagon wheels only. When manufacturing operations in
IRWA have stabilized, this plant will also begin manufacturing locomotive,
coach and EMU wheels, and the product mix among the plants will be ratio-
nalized. The number of wheels to be produced at IRWA could also be increased



- 14 -
somewhat at that time. This would result in overall savings to the industry
since the graphite moulds used by the wheel casting process adopted for IRWA
(para 3.21) are less costly than the forging dies used by DSP and TISCO, and
since the wheel casting process lends itself better to production changes
than the forging process. The large number of tyre and axle types is due
mainly to the steam locomotive fleet which currently requires 64 different
axle-types and 40 different tyre-types. Production of axles in IRWA will
consist of short runs of a fairly large number of types. This is economic-
ally feasible with the long-forging machine to be installed. In preparation
for IRWA, IR has already reduced the number of wheel and axle types, and tire
types it uses by 30% and 20% respectively. IR continues to review the pos-
sibilities for further product standardization.
2.27      Prices paid by IR for wheels and axles supplied by DSP and TISCO
are agreed by the producers and IR under the aegis of the Joint Plant Commit-
tee (JPC) which consists of representatives from the Ministries of Steel and
Railways and the steel plants. In the event of disagreement on prices, the
issue is referred to the Chief Accounts Officer of the Ministry of Finance,
who gives the final decision. The cost elements included in the price struc-
ture are: (i) metal cost based on the JPC price for blooms and ingots; (ii)
quality extras on metal cost, taking into account the manufacturing process
involved; (iii) cost above metal, consisting of fuel, power, wages, stores
and supervision; (iv) overheads and returns consisting of return on gross
assets, depreciation, interest and other overhead expenses; and (v) excise
duty, and miscellaneous expenses. Current average JPC prices for wheels,
axles, and wheelsets, consisting of two wheels and one axle fully assembled,
are shown below compared to average current cif prices (in Rs/unit):
Price Basis                 Wheel    Axle    Wheelset
cif cost                    2,875   2,875       8,850
JPC price                   1,400   1,400       4,300
JPC prices, which have not been adjusted since 1974/75, are considered too low
to be remunerative by the manufacturers DSP and TISCO and are currently under
review by the Chief Cost and Accounts Officer, Ministry of Finance (para 1.19).
2.28      Products of the proposed IR wheel and axle plant will be costed
according to the system used by IR's three other manufacturing units. Plant
output would be transferred to IR at a price based on total manufacturing cost
including overheads and depreciation. During negotiations these arrangements
were agreed with the Government. Profits or excess cash generated by the
plant would revert to IR on a continuing basis. IR would meet its financial
obligation to GOI by paying 6% dividend on plant capital-at-charge.
I. Research, Designs and Standards Organization
2.29      The Research, Designs and Standards Organization (RDSO) is a sepa-
rate functional unit under IR. Guidelines for its research and development
activities, which have been directed mainly towards indigenization of manu-
facture, are laid down by the Railway Board.



- 15 -
2.30      The long-range research and development efforts of RDS0 are
directed mainly towards: (i) technological improvements in power packs for
diesel locomotives, and transmission and auxiliaries for diesel and electric
locomotives; (ii) development of coaches with increased carrying capacity and
reduced weight; (iii) design practices and construction techniques for bridges;
(iv) development of modern track to obtain optimum benefits by way of reduced
maintenance costs, improved riding and reduced wear and tear on rolling stock;
(v) use of signalling and telecommunication techniques for optimizing utili-
zation of tracks and rolling stock and ensuring safety; (vi) reduction in
capital inputs for electrification; and (vii) increasing the speed of trains.
The proposed project will assist the RDSO in acquisition of technology and
testing apparatus for the development of improved technology relating to
power packs for diesel electric locomotives.
J. Operating Performance
2.31       IR's operating performance for the period 1972/73 to 1976/77 is
shown in Table 6. There has been continuous improvement in all areas of
operations except in availability of motive power and rolling stock. Average
gross freight trailing load has reached an all-time high of 1,607 tons and
.net ton-km per wagon day is at 796. Also, wagon turnaround time has been
reduced from 15 days in 1973/74 to 13 days on the BG lines, and from 12.5
days to 11.1 days on the MG lines. The occupancy ratio for all passenger
trains remains very high at 80% and 95% for passenger coaches and EMU cars
respectively, and is about 100% on most mail and express trains.
K. Traffic
2.32      IR's freight and passenger traffic from 1950/51 to 1975/76 is shown
in Table 7. During that period originating tonnage increased by 3.6% annually,
while originating passengers increased by 3.4% annually. IR's revenue freight
traffic has continued its steady but slow growth. However, in 1975/76 and
1976/77, since the recovery of the economy as a whole, and facilitated by IR's
improved overall performance, revenue freight traffic has increased by about
7% annually. The revised estimates for 1977/78 show a further increase in
revenues of 4% and the level of freight traffic to 240 million tons. Projec-
tions for 1977/78 to 1982/83 are shown below (in million originating tons):

Fertilizers              7.8        9.0     10.0      11.0      12.0      13.0
Petroleum Poducts       13.0       14.0     15.0      16.0      16.0      16.0
Other Goods            47.0       48.0      48.5      49.0      49.5      50.0
Revenue            214.0      222.0    234.5    249.0    262.5    276.0
Non-revenue         26.0       26.0      25.5      25.0      24.5      24.0
Total           240.0      248.0    260.0    274.0    287.0    300.0
This projection implies an average annual growth rate of about 5%.  Almost
80% of this increase is projected to occur in steel plant and coal traffic,
and is therefore dependent on production increases in the coal and steel
sectors. Given the general recovery of the Indian economy from the recession
of 1974/75, the start of the new steel plants at Bilai and Bokaro and the
planned production increases of coal and iron ore, an annual growth rate of
5% in originating railway freight traffic is likely to be sustained over the
coming five years.
2.33      The principal traffic growth is related to production in steel
plants. The Bilai steel plant near Nagpur and the Bokaro steel plant near
Calcutta plan to increase their respective capacities from 2.5 and 1.7 mil-
lion tons to 4.0 and 5.0 million tons of finished steel per annum by 1982.
The expected increase in steel production affects coal requirements for steel
plants and washeries, which are estimated at 26 million tons in 1982/83.
Total finished steel production is expected to be 12 million tons, generat-
ing a need for rail transport of about 57 million tons of raw materials
traffic, including coal for steel plants.
2.34      Excluding coal used in steel production, the other major users are
IR and thermal power plants. The expected reduction in non-revenue coal
traffic by IR from 14.5 million tons in 1977/78 to 12.0 million tons in 1982/
83 is related to planned reductions in the steam locomotive fleet. The thermal
power plants, on the other hand, are expected to substantially increase gene-
rating capacity. The Department of Energy projects the requirement to increase
from its present level of 30-35 million tons annually to 50-6() million tons by
1982/83. On this basis IR has estimated total coal requirements for power
houses and other users at 74 million tons in 1982/83. This represents an
increase of 24.5 million tons over 1978/79.
2.35      The present world-wide slump in demand for iron ore, particularly
in Japan, is reflected in the actual traffic in this commodity of which IR
expects to carry 11.5 million tons by 1978/79, a moderate increase of 0.5
million tons over 1976/77. In line with a world market demand switch from



- 17 -
iron lumps to iron fines, the Indian steel industry is switching production
to fines and by 1982/83 expects to capture more of the market share. An
increase between 1977/78 and 1982/83 of 5 million tons in traffic is forecast.
2.36      The demand for cement remains strong and is higher than current
production. GOI is giving encouragement to the construction industry, which
has stimulated demand for cement substantially. IR expects 14.0 million tons
to be handled by rail in 1978/79, as compared to 13.7 million tons in 1977/78,
and an increase of 1 million tons each year after 1978/79 for the period
1979/80 to 1982/83.
2.37      GOI, through the Ministry of Agriculture, has embarked on a policy
of making not only India but also the different regions within the country
self-sufficient in foodgrains. IR therefore conservatively estimates more
or less stagnant traffic volumes through for this category 1982/83.
2.38      Currently, production capacity of fertilizer is much lower than
demand. In line with GOI's policy of self-sufficiency in foodgrains, this
will be augmented. From an estimated 7.8 million tons in 1977/78 fertilizer
traffic by rail is expected to grow to 13 million tons by 1982/83.
2.39      Rail transport of petroleum products is at about 14 million tons
in 1978/79, and moderate increases are expected, as future demand will be
handled mainly by pipelines.
2.40      The category of other goods represents a great variety of com-
modities, ranging from bulk transport of products like salt, sand, stones,
marble to high-value manufactured products. The average transport distance
for the group as a whole is about 868 km, and for high-valued goods it ex-
ceeds 1,000 km. With less than 10% of railway freight representing high-
value commodities transported over short and medium distances, further loss
of traffic to road transport is not expected. IR expects other goods traf-
fic to grow at about 1% per annum, which seems reasonable considering the
experience of the past few years.
2.41      Total originating passenger traffic is projected by the IR to
increase to 3.8 billion passengers in 1982/83 as shown below (in million
passengers):
Passenger Category    1977/78 1978/79 1979/80 1980/81 1981/82 1982/83
Suburban                 1,722   1,838   1,911   1,985   2,058   2,136
Non-suburban             1,411   1,463   1,514   1,565   1,617   1,676
Total                     3,133   3,301   3,425   3,550   3,675   3,812
This projection implies an annual growth rate of about 4% over the coming 5
years with suburban and non-suburban traffic expected to grow by about 3.8%
and 3.5% annually, respectively.

L. Railway Planning
2.42      The corporate planning exercise of the IR, initiated under Credit
280-IN, has resulted in a Corporate Plan for the total railway system, con-
solidating the corporate plans of the individual zonal railways on which it
is based. The Corporate Plan outlines a proposed development strategy for
IR for the period from 1977/78 to 1988/89 and covers passenger and freight
traffic, traction and rolling stock, line capacity, yards and terminals,
shops, production units, research and development, management and manpower,
and financial aspects. The Corporate Plan forms the underlying framework
for the modernization efforts supported by the proposed project.
2.43      The planning, evaluation and project sanctioning system applied by
IR is defined in the various railway codes and policy directives. IR's
internal planning is mainly undertaken for the preparation of annual invest-
ment and works programs. Comprehensive economic studies are undertaken for
major new works such as gauge conversion, electrification schemes, and new
lines. The various components included in the proposed project were each
subjected to comprehensive technical and economic studies by IR in accordance
with terms of reference agreed between IR and IDA.
M. Railway Investment Plan
2.44      To support projected traffic growth and finance asset replacement,
IR's investment plan totals Rs 32,250 million in the 5 years 1978-83, exclud-
ing Rs 1,250 million for metropolitan transport projects. Detailed investment
by plan head is presented in Table 8 and summarized below (in Rs million):
Plan Head          1978/79   1979/80   1980/81   1981/82   1982/83   Total

2.45      The planned investment includes all elements in the proposed project
and the total project cost and proposed credit as related to the total IR
investment program for the five-year period 1978/79 to 1982/83 is shown below:

2.46      The railway equipment requirements, based on projected traffic
volumes, have been estimated by IR as follows:
Item               1977/78  1978/79  1979/80  1980/81  1981/82  1982/83

Current foreign exchange requirements for diesel hydraulic locomotives are
about 40% of production cost, for diesel-electric locomotives and electric
locomotives about 15%, for wagons about 10% and for electric multiple units
and coaches about 5%. The proposed project would assist IR in modernizing
its present locomotive fleet and finance parts and components for their
maintenance.
2.47      Machinery and plant is expected to require considerably more invest-
ment than in the fifth plan period, reflecting both the relatively advanced age
of plant in the IR manufacturing units and workshops and IR plans for expand-
ing existing manufacturing and maintenance capacity in order to arrest dete-
rioration in motive power and rolling stock and improve their performance
while reducing maintenance costs. Almost 60% of line works consist of track
renewals, bridge works and line capacity works, while new lines and electri-
fication schemes amount to about 12% each.
N. Performance Under Previous Credits
2.48      Over the past 29 years, the Bank has approved six loans and seven
credits for IR totalling US$896.5 million. Project audits have been carried
out for Credits 280-IN and 448-IN and the audit findings are contained in
Report No. 1658 of June 30, 1977. The report found that the original invest-
ment program was scaled down because of higher costs and lower than expected
traffic. The projects were implemented on time, and the reestimated rates



- 20 -
of return were similar to the appraisal forecast. Because of unusual eco-
nomic and political circumstances, the financial situation of IR deteriorated
during the project period, but has now improved. The report also found that
in spite of many years of dialogue between the Government and the Bank, trans-
port planning and coordination remained rather weak. Some progress is now
being made on the national level and IR's corporate planning exercise has
been successful.
2.49      Agreements under Credits 280-IN and 448-IN required IR to gene-
rate sufficient revenues to cover all operating expenses, including adequate
appropriations for the Depreciation Reserve Fund and Pension Fund, and divid-
end on capital-at-charge. Because of economic recession, labor unrest and
substantial wage increases for railway staff, IR had difficulties in meeting
this target. IR requested that the earnings covenant be waived for 1973/74,
to which IDA agreed. During negotiations for Credit 448-IN in 1973, it was
realized that time would be required to adjust rates and fares, and it was
therefore agreed that revenues for 1974/75 and 1975/76 should be sufficient
to cover 70% and 85% respectively of the dividend for those years. In 1974/75
and 1975/76 IR still could not fully comply with the agreement. However,
when the retroactive application of wage awards granted by GOI in 1975/76 is
taken into account, IR just about met the covenant requirements. In 1976/77
and 1977/78 IR covered 100% of dividend due to GOI (paras 5.13 and 5.17).
2.50      Agreements under Credits 280-IN and 448-IN also required IR to
prepare and keep up to date a Corporate Plan. The Corporate Plan was final-
ized by end 1976 and forms the basis of the proposed project (para 2.42).
2.51      Agreements under Credit 280-IN required IR to ensure that the
methodology for appraisal of investment projects would continue to be pro-
gressively improved, as trained staff become available. IR is in compliance
with this agreement (para 2.43).
2.52      Agreements under Credit 280-IN required that the content of a time-
table and plan of action for the establishment of a framework for future
Bank Group participation in the transport sector would be worked out by GOI
on the basis of a full review of the transport sector by 19;4. The review
was carried out in 1973 and was subsequently extensively discussed between
GOI and IDA, and in 1976 GOI established a study group in the Planning Com-
mission, assisted by UNDP experts, to prepare a framework for overall tran-
sport planning and coordination in India (para 1.06).
2.53      Agreements under Credit 448-IN also required that revenues and
losses from mass transport systems, if included in IR's budget, would be
separately identified. This is being done.
2.54      Agreements under Credit 582-IN included an earnings covenant which
required IR to earn sufficient revenue to meet all operating expenses and the
dividend payable to the Government for each fiscal year after 1975/76. IR
is in compliance with this covenant (paras 5.13 and 5.17).
2.55      Agreements under Credit 582-IN included also a requirement for IR
to appropriate a global sum of Rs 6,500 million to its Depreciation Reserve



- 21 -
Fund (DRF) during the Fifth Plan and to appropriate to the DRF not less than
Rs 1,300 million in each of the years 1976/77 through 1978/79. IR is in
compliance with this covenant (paras 5.13 and 5.17).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01      The basic objectives underlying the Bank Group's past assistance
to the IR have been to assist in rehabilitating and subsequently modernizing
railway infrastructure, motive power and rolling stock and in improving rail-
way operating efficiency, maintenance, administration and planning. In sup-
port of these objectives, the Bank since 1949 has approved six loans and
seven credits totalling US$896.5 million. The loans and credits were based
on one-three year slices of IR investment programs and covered foreign exchange
for the acquisition of: materials, parts and components for manufacture and
maintenance of railway motive power and rolling stock; machinery and plant for
the IR manufacturing units; and materials and equipment for line improvement
works and telecommunications.
3.02      In the twenty-nine years that have passed since the first Bank
loan to IR, the main railway infrastructure has been substantially improved;
and domestic production of diesel and electric locomotives, coaches and wagons
which the Bank loans and credits supported has resulted in an improved motive
power and rolling stock fleet.
3.03      During the past eight years, motive power and rolling stock have
constituted about 50% of the IR's capital investment; and credit allocations
for the manufacture and maintenance of railway motive power and rolling stock
have become an increasingly important element in Bank Group financial support
of IR. IR's corporate plan envisages investments in motive power of Rs 8.5
billion over the next decade. There is potential for further improvement by
upgrading the design, manufacture and maintenance.
3.04      With the rapidly growing number of diesel and electric locomotives
nearing their mid-lives and therefore in need of major maintenance overhaul,
IR has acknowledged the immediate need for a change in relative priorities
in favor of modernization of maintenance facilities and motive power and roll-
ing stock design, as well as in favor of indigenization of critical standard
items such as wheels and axles which can be more cheaply produced domestically.
The proposed project will support IR in moving in this direction.
3.05      In order to evaluate IR's and major railway suppliers' manufactur-
ing capability, practices, state of technology, product quality and perform-
ance, and thus identify areas where improvements in IR manufacturing and
maintenance operations were most urgently required, a number of IDA missions
were made to all IR's manufacturing units and major workshops and sheds, as
well as to railway-related manufacturers in India, Europe, Mexico, United
States, Canada and Japan. Consultants in metallurgical and heavy engineering



- 22 -
equipment, electric and diesel traction technology and industrial financial
management and control assisted. Annex A details the manufacturers visited
and reports prepared.
3.06      Findings of the preparation missions were extensively discussed
with IR and GOI, especially the Ministries of Finance, Heavy Industries and
Steel, and the Planning Commission. The findings and discussions formed the
basis of the formulation of the project by IR.
B. Objectives
3.07      The objective of the proposed project is the modernization and
improvement of maintenance and manufacture of diesel and electric locomotives
and rolling stock in order to reduce the cost of their maintenance and manu-
facture as well as to improve their performance and availability. The GOI
has requested IDA to support IR in attaining these objectives.
C. Description
3.08      The proposed project would support workshop and locomotive moderni-
zation, wheel and axle manufacture, and product development for IR manufac-
turing units. The project is tentatively estimated at about US$384 million
equivalent, of which US$190 million equivalent is proposed for IDA financing.
The project consists of:
(a)  the acquisition of workshop machinery and tools for imple-
menting the first phase of the IR workshop modernization
and rationalization program including the acquisition of
parts and components for the establishment of unit-exchange
maintenance systems in the main and supporting workshops
(paras 3.09-3.18);
(b)  the establishment at Yelahanka in Karnataka State of a
wheel and axle plant, including ancillary facilities,
with a rated manufacturing capacity of about 70,000
wheels and about 23,000 axles and the import of wheels,
tires and axles for two years of the IR motive power
and rolling stock manufacturing and maintenance program
(paras 3.19-3.29).
(c)  acquisition of thyristor control/transformers sets as well
as improved design and technology, for upgrading/modifying
of present design electric locomotives (paras 3.30-3.31); and
(d)  acquisition of test equipment, technical advisory services
and overseas staff training for manufacturing, quality con-
trol, cost control and design personnel required to achieve
the objectives of the project (paras 3.32-3.34).



- 23 -
(a) Workshop Modernization
3.09      The proposed project will cover workshop modernization for 1978/79
to 1980/81 and will consist of: (i) modernization of four major repair shops
and one manufacturing unit; (ii) improvement of other repair shops and support-
ing units; (iii) introduction and support of a unit exchange maintenance pro-
gram in the repair workshops and sheds included in the proposed project; (iv)
improvement of material-handling equipment and practices in the units included
in the project; and (v) completion of the rationalization plan for a system-
based maintenance network, including improvement and strengthening of the
maintenance organization and technical advisory service as required.
3.10      Keeping in view the physical and financial constraints, a selection
process was devised for choosing the units for the first phase of modernization.
The selection has been governed by the following factors: (i) change in the
product mix; (ii) sophistication of product, present and new; (iii) priority
for improvement in product performance and reliability; (iv) arrears and
backlog in workload; (v) likely changes in future workload; and (vi) size,
age and antiquity of unit. Using the above criteria, one manufacturing unit,
CLW; four major repair workshops, Kancharapara, Kharagpur, Matunga and Parel
were selected for immediate and full modernization and 47 major repair sheds
and supporting units, were selected for need-based improvements.
3.11      Chittaranjan Locomotive Works.  CLW, with 15,500 employees, manu-
factures about 60 electric and 50 diesel hydraulic locomotives per year.
In addition, CLW manufactures a wide range of parts and components for the
Railways, among them 480 traction motors, 50 diesel engines, 1800 tons of
alloy steel, and other items valued at Rs 540 million annually. Immediate
modernization of CLW, estimated to cost Rs 60 million, is warranted to:
(i) remove persistent product quality problems and production bottlenecks
due to inadequate and obsolete plant layout and machinery and lack of proper
material handling equipment; and (ii) increase production of material and
components for maintenance through improved productivity and economy of scale.
3.12      Kancharapara Workshops.  Kancharapara, with 9,000 employees, is
IR's main heavy repair shop for 400 AC electric locomotives and 200 electric
multiple units (EMU). It also maintains freight and passenger equipment.
Since the shop was established in 1863, there have been no layout changes,
and 70% of its machinery is overaged and mostly obsolete. Yet this shop is
responsible for overhauling and maintaining some of the most sophisticated
equipment on the railways. The modernization of this facility, estimated
to cost Rs 80 million, is aimed at rationalization of product mix, higher
quality of product, layout modifications, increased productivity and reduc-
tion of periodical overhaul (POH) cycle.
3.13      Kharagpur Workshops.  Kharagpur is thet largest repair workshop on
IR with 15,425 employees. This shop undertakes periodic overhaul of several
types of motive power and rolling stock, among which are 160 steam and 81
diesel-electric locomotives, 1,600 passenger coaches and 14,000 freight wagons
annually. The shop was established in 1882 and its layout is very inefficient
consisting of 55 separate shops spread over 260,000 square meters and 77% of
machinery is overaged. The modernization of Khairagpur under the project is



- 24 -
estimated to cost Rs 68 million and will lead to improved productivity through
more efficient machinery and material handling equipment and layout changes
to facilitate flow of work.
3.14      Matunga Workshops.  Matunga employs 7,520 people and is primarily
a passenger and freight stock overhaul shop which was established at the turn
of the century. Matunga overhauls about 3,740 passenger and freight coaches
and EMU's and about 1,000 units annually. The workshop layout is obsolete due
to complete changeover of work and about 80% of machinery is overaged. As a
result, the production is sub-optimal and costs very high. Under the project,
Rs 74 million is to be invested at Matunga in new machinery, change of layout
and flow of process to reduce the downtime of equipment under repair.
3.15      Parel Workshops.  Parel has about 5,000 employees and its main
activity is overhaul of about 3,000 coaching stock per year. Parel was estab-
lished in 1876 and expanded in 1910 and about 67% of machinery is overaged.
Layout is a major handicap due to main line tracks running in the middle of
the complex, requiring considerable amount of transportation in the work
process. Under the project, Rs 34 million is to be invested at Parel to
improve work flow and reduce production costs.
3.16      Other Repair and Supporting Units.  Running repair shops and sheds
play the major role in the availability, performance and operational safety
of the railways. This is due to the fact that aside from periodical overhaul
(complete stripping down of equipment, replacing and/or remanufacturing parts
and components, and reassembling), all other maintenance works are undertaken
in such facilities. Therefore, it is imperative that particular attention be
given to these facilities. Consequently, a selective process was established,
along the lines of that for major workshops, for supporting units needing
immediate attention. As a result, 47 major facilities were selected for
modernization, costing Rs 638 million. The bulk of the investment is for
machinery. However, the emphasis will be on: (i) machinery and equipment to
achieve precision, proper testing and quality control required for maintenance
of modern motive power and rolling stock, which is very much lacking now,
resulting in unsatisfactory quality of work performed, abnormally high fre-
quency of breakdowns in operation and lower-than-normal life of parts and
components; and (ii) material-handling equipment to reduce frequent interrup-
tions in work flow and reduce damage to material in transport, both having a
major impact on output, qtuality and cost of repairs.
3.17      Unit Exchange System.  Shortage of foreign exchange, lack of ancil-
lary industries (especially for low off-take items), priority given to manu-
facturing of new motive power and rolling stock, have all culminated in a
serious shortage of spare parts and components for repair and overhaul of
motive power and r-olling stock. As a result, even the scheduled repairs of
motive power and rolling stock is lheld up until a defective part or assembly
is repaired. As practiced world-wide and proven by a small-scale unit ex-
change program foT diesel electric locomotives at IR's Kharagpur workshops,
the maintenance downtimie can be reduced by over 50% through implementation
of a unit exchiange systemu.  Under the project, an investment of Rs 1,384
million in a rotating pool of parts and components is envisaged in order to
implement a unit exchange maintenance program.  Because of the considerable



- 25 -
maintenance backlog, it is estimated that about 30% of the parts and components
procured under the project will be consumed as spare parts, but the unit
exchange pool will be built up to the required level by 1982/83.
3.18      Most of the expected benefits of this project component in the first
three years (1978/79-1980/81) will be realized from the injection of a large
amount of parts and components into the unit-exchange pool. This project
component is expected to cost Rs 2,484 million (US$289 million equivalent)
with a foreign exchange component of Rs 1,296 million (US$151 million equiv-
alent).
(b) Wheel and Axle Plant
3.19      The proposed IR Wheel and Axle Plant (IRWA) was subjected to a tech-
nical and economic study including plant capacity product mix, location and
existing wheel and axle manufacturers in India. The study was carried out
by IR, assisted by suppliers of plant technology, according to terms of refer-
ence agreed with the Association. Consultants retained by the Association
found it to be satisfactory. The plant site is located at Yelahanka, 16 km
from Bangalore, and is served by both broad gauge and meter gauge railway as
well as by road. The location was chosen taking into account costs of elec-
tricity and transport of raw materials and finished products; proximity to
industries supplying other requirements, such as tools, oxygen and acetylene
gas, electrodes and graphite moulds; and the location of existing wheel and
axle plants. Annual savings from locating the proposed plant at Yelahanka
rather than at the most favorable alternative location at Nagpur were esti-
mated at Rs 2.5 million, mainly from savings in electricity cost and transport
cost of axle steel and foundry material. In line with Government policy of
locating industrial units outside congested urban areas, a satellite township
is being developed by IR close to the site of the plant. The production
capacity of the plant has been planned to cover anticipated shortfalls in
domestic wheel and axle production. Since existing manufacturers of wheels
and axles have shown no interest in substantial expansion of their manufac-
turing capacity and since IR will continue to buy more than  90% of total
domestic requirements, GOI has decided to establish the IRWA as a departmental
manufacturing unit under IR with a status similar to that of the CLW, DLW and
ICF.
3.20      The IRWA will have a covered area of 50,000 m  and consist of three
units: (i) the wheel unit with an annual rated capacity of 70,000 wheels;
(ii) the axle unit with an annual rated capacity of 23,000 axles; and (iii)
the assembly unit with an annual rated capacity of 23,000 wheelsets. Proposed
plant layout is shown in Chart IBRD 18717. A collaboration agreement for wheel
manufacturing technology has been signed with Amsted Industries, United States.
Detailed engineering for the wheel unit will be completed by an IR design team
in consultation with the collaborators. The layout for the wheel unit has
been based on the preliminary plans furnished by Amsted Industries. Ancillary
service facilities such as stores, sheds, laboratory, and training schools
will also be provided. Necessary railway sidings to feed the shops and for
dispatch of finished products will also be provided.



- 26 -
3.21      Manufacture of wheels will be done by a cast steel process based
on technology supplied by Griffin Wheel Company, a subsidiary of Amsted Indus-
tries. The process was chosen after careful review by IR of available technic-
ally and economically viable options. Review by IDA missions of current users
of available technologies has confirmed IR's findings. The wheel unit will
comprise two electric arc furnaces, pressure pouring equipment as well as
equipment for handling, processing and conveying the graphite casting moulds.
In-line inspection facilities would ensure quality of the wheels manufactured.
The manufacturing process for cast steel wheels, and for comparison for forged
steel wheels, is summarized in the process flow chart in Chart IBRD 18715.
3.22      Axle forging will take place with a precision long forging machine
which is the most efficient equipment for forging of a large number of small
quantity axle types. Complete heat treatment facilities comprising normaliz-
ing, oil quenching and tempering would be provided in the axle shop. For axle
machining, the essential equipment consists of roughing and finishing copying
lathes, multiple operation axle and machining equipment, grinding and burnish-
ing machines, and inspection facilities provided as part of the production
line. The concept of integrated engineering for axles to be handled from
machine to machine and for facilitating the flow of axles to the various
machining operations would be adopted along with in-line inspection facil-
ities for quality control. The proposed process of manufacture of axles is
summarized in the process flow chart in Chart IBRD 18715.
3.23      The assembly section is so arranged as to eliminate unnecessary
handling of material by letting finished wheels and axles intended for
assembly converge into the assembly shop. The assembly shop will have a
finish boring machine for the wheels and an assembly wheel press. The roller
bearing section to mount the bearings on the finished wheelsets also forms
part of the assembly shop. Inspection facilities for finished wheelsets are
provided in the assembly shop.
3.24      Estimated inventory requirements are shown in Table 9.  The steel
requirements of the wheel and axle plant are as follows: (i) 50,000 tons of
steel scrap for the wheel unit of which 15,000 tons are expected to be gene-
rated within the plant and the remaining 35,000 tons will be acquired from
the Southern, South Central and Central Railways, which are all close to the
new plant; and (ii) 10,500 tons of steel billets/rounds for BG axles, along
with 1,500 tons of used BG axles from railways for the manufacture of MG
axles. For wheels, the yield from molten metal to finished wheel would be
65%. In case of axles, the yield of finished axles from the blooms will be
75%. Average rejection rates for both wheels and axles have been set at 15%,
based on experiences with the process in other countries. Rejected castings
and forgings would be recycled in the plant. Production build-up for wheels
is expected to be 10,000 in 1982/83, 26,000 in 1983/84, and at least 60,000
in 1984/85. Production build-up for axles is expected to be 4,000 in 1983/
84, 13,000 in 1984/85 and at least 16,000 in 1985/86. During negotiations
the production build-up targets were confirmed by IR.
3.25      The total IRWA power demand is 23 MW.  The Karnataka Electricity
Board have agreed to supply power to the plant as per phased requirements
indicated to them. With the commissioning of the Kalinadhi hydro-electric



- 27 -
scheme by 1978/79, adequate and reliable power supply will be assured for
the plant. High power 66 KV transmission towers with conductors for supply
of power to a factory located adjacent to the railway plant site have already
been erected and will be able to meet the power requirements of the IRWA plant
too. Proposed power supply would be from two power distribution centers,
Peenya and Hoody, which would ensure adequate power supply if for some reason
power from one source failed, or in case one source were not able to meet
the full requirement. During negotiations, IR confirmed that the Government
of Karnataka had provided assurances to IR that the electric power and water
required for efficient operation of IRWA would be available and that this
would be reflected in formal arrangements before the start-up of production.
3.26      Daily consumption of water for the plant is estimated at 2.3 million
liters. The Karnataka State Government have assured reliable water supply,
and the construction contract has been awarded. It is expected that the water
supply would be available by December 1978. IR has sunk two tubewells and an
open well to ensure adequate water supply during construction of the plant.
3.27      The IRWA would require a total labor force and staff of 1,200
employees of which about 800 employees (500 in wheel plant and 300 in axle
and assembly plant) would be directly involved in manufacturing, plant
engineering and quality control and materials management, the remainder being
general management, colony and security staff. The wheel and axle plant would
work in two shifts. The labor force and the number of shifts in the wheel
and axle plants are adequate for efficient operations. Project implementation
and permanent organizations are treated in para 3.42.
3.28      The project has been designed with due regard to environmental and
worker safety aspects. A Karnataka State law for environmental and pollution
control, passed in 1974, stipulates that all industrial enterprises must con-
form to environmental standards specified in the legislation relevant to the
industry concerned. The IRWA is within these standards and no significant
adverse environmental impact is expected from the project.
3.29      The proposed wheel and axle plant is estimated to cost Rs 647 mil-
lion (US$75 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of Rs 327
million (US$38 equivalent). Summary fixed capital cost and schedule is shown
in Table 11, and summary working capital cost andl schedule is shown in Table
12. Annual operating cost when the plant operates at rated capacity is shown
in Table 13. In addition, the project will provide for two years' manufacture
by DSP and TISCO and imports of wheels and axles for manufacturing and main-
tenance requirements estimated at Rs 662 million (US$77 million equivalent)
with a foreign exchange component of Rs 215 million (US$25 million equivalent).
(c) Development Support
3.30      Thyristor Control/Transformer Sets.  The project would support
import of 30 thyristor control/transformer sets to be tested on three groups
of the present AC electric locomotive fleet. Upon successful trials, similar
thyristor control/transformer sets would be manufactured domestically for



- 28 -
installation in the present AC electric locomotive fleet of 750 units with a
view to improving their performance and reducing their operating and mainte-
nance costs.
3.31      RDSO Product Improvement.  Considerable work has to be done regard-
ing improvements to parts and components of diesel locomotives manufactured
by IR and at the same time introduce new versions of the present design.
To undertake this, the project will support engine testing and development
facilities and acquisition of proven parts and components for the purpose
of testing and design adaptation to Indian ambient and operating conditions.
In addition to hardware, the project will support acquisition of designs and
technical advisory services, computer programs needed for clesign simulations
and proper analysis of test results, and overseas staff training. During
negotiations the RDSO product improvement program, includirng terms of refer-
ence for individual tasks, were reviewed and confirmed with IR.
3.32      Technical advisory services under the project will also include
assistance by suppliers of plant technology to IRWA during detailed engineer-
ing, preparation of specifications, plant construction, commissioning and
start-up amounting to an estimated 48 man-months at US$7,000 per man-month,
resulting in a total cost of about US$340,000 of which US$250,000 would be
foreign exchange. The staff training portion also includes estimated allo-
cations for training needs of the other project components. During negotia-
tions details of the technical advisory services support program were discussed
and agreed with IR.
3.33      Training of IRWA staff and work force in respect of specialized
technology required for operation and maintenance of the plant would be
carried out in the manufacturing and training facilities of the suppliers of
plant technology. The collaboration agreement with Amsted Industries provides
for IR staff being trained in the Griffin Works in production, maintenance,
process and quality control. Similarly, in respect of the axle unit, IR would
seek arrangements for training with the suppliers of plant technology. It
is estimated that about 60 men would be trained for the wheel unit in the
collaborators works, and provision for this has already been made in the collabo-
ration agreement. A total of 1,130 man-months of training for IRWA would be
provided under the project; of these, an estimated 230 man-months would be
overseas. Total cost of training for IRWA under the project is estimated
at US$1.0 million, of which US$600,000 would be foreign exchange. In addi-
tion to specialized training, general training of the work force would take
place at railway workshops and steel plants in India. Details of training
requirements are shown in Table 10. During negotiations, the outline of the
training program for IRWA staff and workforce was reviewed and agreed with
the Government and assurances were obtained that prior to startup of IRWA
operations it would train all technical staff and work force of IRWA in
accordance with a detailed training program satisfactory to the Association.
3.34      This project component is estimated to cost Rs 156 million (US$18
million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of Rs 104 million
(US$12 million equivalent).

D. Cost Estimates
3.35      The items included in the project form part of IR's five-year in-
vestment plan 1978/79 to 1982/83 totalling Rs 32,250 million (US$3,750 million
equivalent). Principal items included in the proposed project and credit are
detailed in Annex B. The project is estimated to cost Rs 3,949 million (US$459
million equivalent) with an estimated foreign exchange component of Rs 1,968
(US$229 million equivalent). An estimated Rs 690 million (US$80 million
equivalent) in taxes and duties is included in total costs. The cost esti-
mates are summarized below:

3.36      The cost estimates are based on prices of January 1978.  They are
based on ex-factory prices for similar items manufactured in India and on
recent prices of imported equipment. A physical contingency allowance of
10% has been incorporated in the cost of IRWA. This is satisfactory, since
earthworks have been completed; buildings, for which architectural designs
are complete, are relatively simple; and preliminary industrial engineering
is complete. Price contingencies for all project items have been included to
cover expected price increases until contracts are awarded as well as price
escalation during implementation and commissioning of the wheel and axle plant.



- 30 -
Based on estimates by IR, the price contingency has been estimated at an
annual average of 7% for local and foreign costs. The foreign exchange rate
was assumed to be US$1.00 = Rs 8.60.
3.37      Local manufacturers of plant and machinery could win contracts
amounting to Rs 387 million (US$45 million equivalent) of the goods to be
procured under ICB, therefore reducing the estimated direct and indirect for-
eign exchange component of the project costs to Rs 1,704 million (US$198
million equivalent) as summarized below:

E. Financing
3.38      The Association would finance the foreign exchange component of
estimated project costs, i.e., US$190 million equivalent under the proposed
credit and US$7 million equivalent of undisbursed funds from Credit 582-IN,
representing 43% of total project cost. GOI will finance the remaining
US$262 million equivalent. All project items are included in GOI's Draft
Five-Year Plan 1978/79 to 1982/83. During negotiations it was agreed that
GOI would provide adequate and timely releases of funds in accordance with
the implementation schedule.



- 31 -
F. Implementation
3.39      IR will be responsible for the implementation of the project as
part of its ongoing works and manufacturing program. It has the necessary
capability and competence to carry out the project. A time-phased project
implementation schedule is shown in Chart IBRD 18833. This schedule as well
as supervision and progress reporting arrangements, including IR preparation
of evaluation report on thyristor control/transformer test results, and
Government preparation of a final report upon completion of the project,
were discussed and confirmed during negotiations.
3.40      Workshops.  The present organization is not adequate for deriving
the maximum benefits from the intended investment in workshop modernization.
Therefore as part of the project, IR will: (i) complete a workshop ration-
alization plan in accordance with objectives for a workshop master plan;
(ii) provide rigorous monitoring of project implementation; (iii) introduce
into the organization new expertise in machine tool technology, cutting tool
technology, work measurement, and method study; (iv) provide training programs
required for upgrading and updating of skills; and (v) employ consultancy
services as required. During negotiations implementation by IR of a plan of
action for a workshop master plan study with targets to be achieved in major
workshops and for measuring the impact of the unit-exchange system was dis-
cussed and agreed with the Government. This is shown in Annex C.
3.41      Wheels and Axles.  Preliminary engineering and design of the pro-
ject is completed. Detailed engineering has started and is expected to be
completed in 9 months. Physical implementation of earth works started in
1976 and is almost completed. The wheel plant is expected to be completed
by mid-1980 and the axle plant by end 1982. Equipment delivery and construc-
tion schedules, which are considered reasonable, are based on information
provided by potential suppliers as well as by IR. Normal production would
be attained in 1985. During negotiations, it was agreed with the Government
that IR will employ experts, with qualifications and on terms satisfactory
to the Association, with the purpose of assisting IR in detailed engineering,
preparation of specifications and plant construction, commissioning and
startup and monitoring of manufacturing operations and establishment of
production and inventory planning and control systems.
3.42      IRWA management will have primary responsibility for project imple-
mentation. Direct responsibility for project execution is delegated to IRWA's
engineering department which is headed by a competent and experienced engineer
who will report directly to IRWA's general manager. The organizational setup
for project implementation is shown in Chart IBRD 18729, and the proposed
permanent organization in Chart IBRD 18716. During negotiations, it was
agreed with the Government that IR would ensure, that at all times the IRWA
would be adequately staffed under the supervision of experienced and competent
management.
3.43      Development Support.  During negotiations specifications for the
thyristor control/transformer sets and detailed terms of reference for RDSO
product improvement, technical advisory services and training were reviewed
with IR and an action plan for their implementation confirmed.



- 32 -
G. Procurement
3.44      Items financed by the Association will be procured by IR through
international competitive bidding and limited tender from established
manufacturers in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines except for: (a) pro-
prietary items for the wheel and axle plant which have to be procured under
license or by technical need; and (b) contracts of US$100,000 equivalent or
less, where advantage of ICB would be clearly outweighed by the administrative
burden thereof. Local manufacturers are expected to bid for items under the
project and a domestic preference of 15% or the import duty, whichever is
less, would be applied in bid evaluation. During negotiations, it was agreed
with the Government, that when the lowest evaluated bidder is a foreign
manufacturer, permission to import will be forthcoming immediately and no
further review by any agency of the Government will be made.
3.45      The items to be financed under the credit and procured through
limited tender are estimated to cost about US$21 million equivalent. Pro-
prietory items for the wheel and axle plant amounting to about US$8 million
equivalent, are to be procured from original sources. The total amount of
contracts less than US$100,000 equivalent not covered by ICB is estimated
to be about US$5 million equivalent. Such contracts will be placed using
IR's internal procedures for procurement which are satisfactory.
H. Disbursements
3.46      Subject to review and agreement with the Association, savings in
any category of the proceeds will be available to cover increases in any other
category except proprietary items. Disbursements are expected to be completed
by December 31, 1984. Disbursements under the project would be made against
100% of the following: (i) the c.i.f. cost of imported items; (ii) the ex-
factory cost exclusive of any taxes and duties of items procured from domestic
suppliers, except for wheels and axles; and (iii) the cost of training, tech-
nical advisory services, and installation and inspection of equipment requir-
ing foreign expertise. A schedule of estimated disbursements is shown in
Table 14.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      The proposed project will modernize and improve the maintenance
and manufacture of diesel and electric locomotives and rolling stock in
order to reduce the cost of these operations as well as to improve their



- 33 -
performance and availability. During the past two decades, IR has concen-
trated on improving railway infrastructure and expanding the motive power and
rolling stock fleet to carry ever increasing traffic volumes. Concurrently
with this expansion, IR moved from steam to diesel and elec.ric traction.
Partly due to the relatively young age of the diesel and electric locomotive
fleet and partly due to foreign exchange constraints, the workshop system
received relatively little attention during this period, with the result that
about 80% of machinery and plant in the workshops are overaged and annual
periodic overhaul capacity, already unsatisfactory, is becoming increasingly
insufficient relative to requirements. Substantial foreign exchange savings
could be achieved by domestic manufacture of wheels and axles for IR. The
present design of diesel and in particular electric locomotives is basically
about 20 years old and could be substantially improved with the adoption of
modern technology. To achieve these improvements, the proposed project would
support workshop and locomotive modernization, wheel and axle manufacture,
and product development for IR manufacturing units. To the extent that cost
savings derived from the project are not passed on to IR's customers, they
will revert to the general GOI budget for redistribution in accordance with
overall Government policies.
4.02      The proposed workshop component would be the first phase of the
IR workshop rationalization and modernization plan to improve the efficiency
of the IR workshop system with a view to immediately containing and subse-
quently eliminating the maintenance backlog for motive power and rolling
stock. The main direct benefits from the workshop component would reduce
queueing time of motive power and rolling stock because of increased product-
ivity of workshop machinery and plant.
4.03      The proposed wheel and axle component would increase the domestic
manufacturing capability for wheels and axles so as to meet more economically
than through imports the total requirements therefor. The main direct benefits
from the wheel and axle plant would be savings in costs of wheels and axles.
4.04      The development support would provide support for start-up of the
wheel and axle plant and for locomotive and rolling stock design and product
improvement and related testing facilities. The main direct benefits would
be increased performance and reduced operating costs of locomotives and roll-
ing stock.
4.05      The weighted average economic return on the main project components
including technical assistance is 23%; with the workshop component having an
average return of 27%; and the wheel and axle plant a return of 19%.
B. Costs and Benefits
4.06      The costs and benefits used for the economic evaluation were esti-
mated as c.i.f. plus economic distribution costs for all tradeable items.
The economic cost of foreign exchange was assumed at US$1.00 = Rs 10, and
the economic cost of labor, which in this project would be mainly skilled
industrial labor, was assumed equal to its domestic market value.



- 34 -
C. Workshops
4.07      The workshop modernization program covers machinery and equipment
for one manufacturing unit, four major workshops and selected sheds as well
as parts, components and sub-assemblies for the introduction of a unit-
exchange maintenance system. The program would be carried out during the
period from 1978/79 to 1980/81. Economic costs of the workshop modernization
program would amount to about Rs 1,420 million of which Rs 838 million would
be machinery and plant, and Rs 582 million would be working capital in the
form of parts and components. Benefits would be savings in locomotives,
coaches and wagons due to avoided increases in ineffectives. The capital
cost of ineffectives in 1980/81 was estimated at about Rs 2,932 million,
corresponding to an average annual increase in capital cost of ineffectives
during the period from 1976/77 to 1980/81 of about Rs 733 million. Economic
evaluation shows that the workshop modernization would be well justified.
Based on an investment period of three years, and an assumed economic life
of fixed assets of ten years, this project component would yield an economic
return of 27%.
D. Wheels and Axles
(a) Wheel and Axle Plant
4.08       The wheel and axle plant would have a rated capacity of 70,000
wheels and 23,000 axles. Normal operation will be reached in 1985/86. The
production volumes during plant start-up from 1980/81 to 1984/85 are given in
para 3.24. Civil engineering works have already started and all plant invest-
ment is expected to be completed by 1982/83. Economic cost of establishing
the plant would amount to Rs 509 million, of which Rs 472 million are fixed
assets and Rs 36 million are working capital. Benefits from the plant would
be savings in the cost of wheels, which would otherwise have to be imported.
Economic cash flows are shown in Table 15 for a production level of 70,000
wheels/22,780 axles and 50,000 wheels/16,000 axles respectively. Savings
in 1985/86 would amount to Rs 167 million at the higher production level
and Rs 115 million at the lower level. Based on a construction and startup
period of seven years and an economic project life of fifteen years, this
project component would yield an economic return of 19% at the higher pro-
duction level and an economic return of 15% at the lower production level.
The economic breakeven points are shown in Table 16 and would be reached at
about 25,000 wheels and 15,000 axles.
(b) Wheels and Axles
4.09      The wheel and axle program would cover two years' supply of wheels
and axles of which about one-half would be for maintenance and the other
half for new rolling stock. The program would be carried out during 1978/79
and 1979/80. Economic costs of the program would amount to Rs 610 million.



- 35 -
Benefits from the program would be avoided losses to the economy from IR being
unable to meet freight and passenger transport demand due to lack of wheels
and axles for rolling stock estimated at equivalent to 19,000 wagons annually
in terms of 4-wheeler units.
E. Development Support
(a) Thyristor Control/Transformer Sets
4.10       During the initial stages of 25 KV electrification, IR imported two
types of mixed traffic locomotives, WAMI and WAM2, both of which were equipped
with ignitron rectifiers and transformer tap changer controls of type N40.
Spare parts for this equipment, originally acquired with the locomotives, have
been used up over the years and are no longer produced inside or outside India
due to technical obsolescence. The tap changer type N32 and transformer cur-
rently used for WAM4 and manufactured in India is not fit for WAM1 and WAM2
because of weight and differences in mounting. Both WAM1 and WAM2 have been
in service for nearly 20 years and are now due for major overhaul. IR pro-
poses to replace 20 of the existing transformer/tap changers on WAM1 and WAM2
locomotives with new transformer/thyristor controls to test this technique for
further application with the remaining WAMI and WAM2. The project includes
20 thyristor/transformer sets. The WAM4 locomotive manufactured at CLW is
provided with a transformer of type BOT 3460, and tap changer of type N32,
limiting its power to 3600 hp. IR proposes to test modern thyristor control
technique on 10 WAM4 in order to achieve increased utilization and versatility
of this locomotive type. The economic cost of 30 thyristor/transformer sets
would amount to Rs 95 million. The main benefit from application of thyristor
controls is savings in manufacturing cost. Tap-changers are mechanical and
require a large number of switches while thyristors are an application of
solid state technology which is cheaper to manufacture and lower in mainte-
nance costs. Potential manufacturing cost in India of a new thyristor
control/transformer set would be at least 15% cheaper than the manufacturing
cost of a tapchanger/transformer set of the above-mentioned designs. In
addition, thyristor controls would ensure better overall locomotive per-
formance than tapchanger controls. Since the thyristor control/transformer
sets included in this project are experimental, no separate economic return
was calculated for this project component.
(b) Other Development Support
4.11      Other development support consists of laboratory equipment for pro-
duct improvement on the existing locomotives, technical assistance for start-
up of the wheel and axle plant, and training. For the economic analysis, the
costs of these project items have been included under the thyristor control/
transformer sets and wheel and axle plant.

F. Overall Economic Evaluation
4.12      Overall economic evaluation shows that implementat:ion of all proj-
ect items is well justified and appropriately timed. The economic return (ER)
for each major project element as well as their sensitivity to variations
in costs and benefits are shown below (in %):
Assumptions               Total  Workshops   IRWA

Costs, and
Expected value of benefits       23      27          19

costs and
Expected value of benefits        19     22          15
25% increase in benefits         26      30          21
25% decrease in benefits          9      11           6
15% decrease in project
costs, and
Expected value of benefits       28      33          23
25% increase in benefits         35      41          29
25% decrease in benefits         19      22          15
The results show that even with a 15% increase in project costs and a 25%
decrease in benefits, the total project would still yield an ER of 9%. All
project components involve proven technology that has been in extended use
in other parts of the world; technological risks connnected with the project
are therefore small. In addition, IR has successfully operated large scale
railway operations and manufacturing enterprises over decades and has com-
petent managerial and technical expertise therefor; risks from inadequate
project implementation and operation are therefore negligible.
V. FINANCE AND EARNINGS
A. Introduction
5.01      The GOI requires IR to pursue a financial policy that will result
in the earning of net revenues which are sufficient to meet the dividend pay-
ment due to the Government on capital provided to the Railway, and to earn
a surplus out of which certain capital investment can be financed.



- 37 -
5.02      Until recently IR was able to meet its dividend liability of about
5.5% on its capital-at-charge and to continue to finance a significant portion
of its investment program despite maintaining low freight rates and passenger
fares. As a consequence of slower traffic growth in recent years, however,
IR was forced to adopt a more cost conscious policy and to examine its finan-
cial accounting and control methods. In addition, traffic costing is now an
integral part of tariff formulation.
5.03      Apart from providing for replacement of assets through the
Depreciation Reserve Fund (DRF), IR is required to: (i) pay a dividend on
capital-at-charge; (ii) finance Development Fund (DF) expenditure - generally
covering improvement to passenger and other amenities; and (iii) pay interest
on its current loan balances. To meet these liabilities, IR has had in the
past 8-10 years to borrow from Government General Revenues, on an increased
scale. The balance as of March 31, 1977 was Rs 4,619 million and it was
reduced to Rs 3,686 million by March 31, 1978.
5.04      The Association has emphasized its concern over temporary loans to
which there are four alternative solutions. These are: (i) liquidate all
loans by certain date - would require roughly 6% additional revenue if the
loans are to be liquidated by 1982; (ii) stabilize loan balance at the current
amount; or (iii) GOI write-off of the present loans; or (iv) to IR capitalize
the present loans. A committee has been set up to consider the various al-
ternatives and how to deal with the financial arrangement between IR and GOI
regarding temporary loans, and is to come up with recommendations on restruc-
turing of capital by the end of 1979. During negotiations it was confirmed
that IR would make available to the Association the reports from the Committee
on Capital Restructuring and Rail Tariff Enquiry Committee (para 5.12) by the
end of 1979 and would inform the Association as to any measures which were
being taken to implement recommendations made by the committees.
B. Accounts and Audits
5.05      Financial arrangements with the Government and audit procedures
have not changed since the last appraisal report. Certain improvements to
accounting procedures have been effected, including a system of cash flow
control against monthly budget allowances.
5.06      Three task forces were established to examine IR's:  (a) budgetary,
accounting and management practices; (b) depreciation policy; and (c) restruc-
turing of capital.
5.07      The task force reports on budgetary, accounting, and management
practices have been received by the Railway Board and accepted by the GOI and
are now before the Estimates Committee of Parliament and Auditor and Controller
General for their review. The essence of the new financial system is to split
large and small group accounts in accordance with functional rather than as
now with output oriented financial information systems. The task force reports
under review primarily deal with demand changes, and IR expects to introduce



- 38 -
later more comprehensive performance budgeting or responsibility accounting.
It is anticipated that implementation of such a system will be throughout IR
and would follow these stages; the 1978/79 budget will conform to the old
classification; the revised estimate for 1978/79 and the budget for 1979/80
will be submitted in the new form. The major improvements recommended would
be as follows:
(a) relate expenditures to the budget by a common classification
making comparison and performance measurements easier;
(b)  make expenditures more related to responsibility centers;
(c)  introduce a more comprehensive accounting classification; and
(d)  enable the same financial data to be used by the three main
users, namely GOI, Ministry of Finance and IR.
5.08      The Working Group on depreciation provided three optional methods.
Government's decision was to adopt a system which provides for calculation
of depreciation based on replacement costs, calculated on the basis of
original asset cost; plus a factor for inflation and technological improvements.
5.09      The accounts of IR are audited by the Director of Railway Audit,
Office of Comptroller and Auditor General, GOI. Audit arrangements are
thorough and satisfactory.
C. Rates and Fares
5.10      The Government has in the past applied a tariff policy which has
tended to subsidize large segments of freight (essential basic commodities)
and passenger traffic (third class travel). The latest rate and fare in-
creases in 1975/76 represented a distinct step towards cost-based tariffs.
Rail freight of coal over longer distances in the past has been a prime
example of subsidized transport, which annually resulted in considerable
losses to the railways. However, coal freight rates are now closer to actual
costs. Freight rates for other commodities are also close to costs. As a
result, most subsidies on freight traffic are at present eliminated.
5.11      A similar cost-based tariff policy has been applied towards passen-
ger fares. There have been substantial increases in all traffic categories,
but particularly in short-distance third-class (recently renamed second-class)
travel which in the past resulted in considerable losses to the railways. How-
ever, the rate increases applied particularly to other than commuter traffic,
which still remains heavily subsidized for social reasons, although there is
a clear desire within the Government to reduce the losses on this traffic.
5.12      The Government set up a Rail Tariff Enquiry Committee in September
1977 to examine the structure of fares, rates and other charges for public
traffic carried by trains and to recommend any modifications which should be
made. The Committee is expected to submit its report by end of 1979, and IR



- 39 -
has confirmed that the Association would receive the report and would be
informed as to any measures which were being taken to implement the recom-
mendations made by the Committee.
D. Past Performance
5.13       IR's actual revenue and expenditure accounts for the period 1972/73
to 1976/77 are detailed in Table 17 and the revised estimate for 1977/78 in
Table 19 and these are summarized below (in Rs million):
Revised
Estimate
Account Head         1972/73  1973/74  1974/75  1975/76  1976/77  1977/78
Operating Revenue        11,624   11,379   14,082   17,670   20,361   21,316
Working Expenses          8,566    9,353   11,863   14,702   15,490   16,111
Net Cash Operating
Revenue                 3,058    2,026    2,219    2,968    4,871    5,205
Appropriation to DRF    1,100    1,150    1,150    1,150    1,350    1,400
Appropriation to PF         160       160       160       245       350       400
Net Operating Revenue   1,798         716       909    1,573    3,171    3,405
Appropriation to DF         154       162      1]73       203       208       241
Net Revenue               1,644       554       736    1,370    2,963    3,164
Dividend on Capital-
at-Charge               1,615    1,709    1,875    1,981    2,091    2,271
Net Surplus (Deficit)        29   (1,155)  (1,139)    (611)         872      893
Operating Ratio (%)        84.5      93.7      93.5      91.1     84.4      84.0
5.14      After the fuel price increases of 1973 and 1974, IR's fuel costs
increased considerably.  In addition the high inflation experienced in the
country during the period 1973/74 to 1976/77 led GOI to grant dearness allow-
ances to workers with retroactive adjustments thus escalating IR personnel
costs. Simultaneously, the low level of freight activity during this period
further accentuated the problems. All these factors led to inadequate net
operating revenues for meeting the full dividend liability to the Government.
Consequently, there were a series of net deficits of Rs 1,155 million in 1973/
74; of Rs 1,139 million in 1974/75 and of Rs 611 million in 1975/76. However,
in 1976/77, IR showed recovery and generated a surplus of Rs 872 million; this
positive result is expected to continue. The revised estimate for 1977/78
indicates a surplus of Rs 893 million which far exceeded the budget figure.
Working expenses have been reduced by Rs 377 million compared to the budget
figure despite increased traffic handling. This is significant as no freight
rate or fare increases were granted for the second consecutive year despite
escalation in costs. The reduction in operating expenses indicates better
efficiency and tighter expenditure control.
5.15      The operating ratio increased from 84.5% in 1972/73 to 93.7% in
1973/74; however it has been declining steadily reaching 84.0% in 1977/78
which is satisfactory. Operating expenses include working expenses, appro-
priation to DRF and PF and the operating ratio relates the operating expenses



- 40 -
to the operating revenue. The rate of return on capital-at-charge from a low
of 1.4% in 1973/74 has increased to 6.5% in 1976/77.
5.16      The balance sheet of IR at March 31, 1977 is shown in Table 18.
The value of fixed assets is not shown either at historical cost or at re-
placement cost; their values represent the original cost of assets plus any
improvements when subsequently replaced. The inflation element in the cost
of replacements is charged against DRF and does not become reflected in the
fixed asset values. The amount of Government capital-at-charge approximately
corresponds to what would normally be regarded as the value of net fixed assets.
E. Future Prospects
5.17      The forecast of revenues and expenditures 1978/79 to 1982/83 is
shown in Table 19 and summarized below (in Rs million):

Net Revenue                   2,982    2,888    3,062    3,238    3,464
Dividend on Capital-
at-Charge                   2,328    2,565    2,753    3,005    3,257
Net Surplus (Deficit)           654       323       309       233       207
Operating Ratio (%)            85.4      86.4      86.3      86.1      85.7
The prices used for rates, fares and expenses are at April ].978 levels, and
the revenues are based on the traffic forecasts discussed in Chapter II.
These figures take into account all rates and fares increases granted up to
April 1978 and labor costs include all allowances sanctioned to September
1977. No provision has been made for increases in wages, fuel and material
except for increases related to additional traffic. The DRF for the 5-year
period 1978/79-1982/83 amounts to Rs 10,500 million, averaging Rs 2,100
million each year. This compares favorably with the previous five years
1974/75-1978/79 when appropriation to DRF was placed at Rs 6,500 million
with an average of not less than Rs 1,300 million each year. Even if there
is no change in tariff or cost structure and despite the substantial increase
in the annual DRF allocation, IR expects to generate a moderate surplus in
each of the years during the period 1978/79-1982/83. The balance sheets as of
March 31, for the period 1976-1983 are presented in Table 20. The rate of
return on average capital-at-charge is on the average about 5.5% per annum.



- 41 -
5.18      During negotiations, it was agreed that GOI would maintain passenger
fares and freight rates and take all other actions as may be necessary or
appropriate so as to provide to the Railways net revenue sufficient to enable
the Railways to meet out of internally generated resources all operating
expenses and dividend payments on capital-at-charge.
5.19      An IR Task Force appointed to study the management information
system (MIS) at IR production units submitted its report in June 1977. The
report recommends improved planning and control systems at IR manufacturing
units, particularly in the area of product (industrial) costing and depart-
mental performance measurement. The Task Force report has also been submitted
for clearance of equipment acquisition to the Department of Electronics, which
reports directly to the Prime Minister. The MIS will result in better cost
control by product and pinpoint needed corrective action by management. Dur-
ing negotiations, IR confirmed that it would cause the DLW, CLW, ICF and IRWA
(before start-up of production) to introduce improved industrial management
information and control systems in order to generate quickly and continuously
data necessary for planning and control, including product costing and assess-
ment of departmental performance. IR further confirmed that the industrial
costing system at IRWA would also reflect cost of capital in the cost of
manufacture.

5.21      The above financing plan is based on the present financial arrange-
ments, particularly with respect to dividends and temporary loans, between
the Government and IR. IR would be able to finance 40% of its total invest-
ment requirements out of net internally generated funds. The balance would
be provided by the government, either in the form of increase in capital-at-
charge or in the form of temporary loans to be repaid from future revenue
surpluses. Forecast financial statements have been prepared on the basis of
maximum investment of Rs 32,250 million during the period 1978/79 to 1982/83.
G. Financial Aspects of Wheel and Axle Plant
5.22      The capital cost of the plant including taxes is estimated at
Rs 596 million and working capital at Rs 51 million. The foreign exchange



- 43 -
capital requirement of the plant is about US$38 million equivalent or about
50% of the total outlay. The amount required for construction will be in-
cluded in the railway budget presented annually to the Parliament. Dividend
on capital-at-charge is paid by IR to GOI on plant investment at a rate of 6%
per annum or about Rs 38 million.
5.23      Working capital will be maintained from current plant operations.
Production costs include fixed and variable costs and all the elements of
manufacturing costs and amount to about Rs 95 million annually. Adequate
provision has been made for preventive maintenance, repairs and renewals
during the project period. Royalties to the collaborator for quantities
of wheels to be manufactured have been provided for in the production costs.
Costs of rejects have also been incorporated in the cost of production.
5.24      The transfer price from IRWA will cover total manufacturing cost,
including overheads and depreciation at replacement cost. Any excess funds
generated by IRWA through its operations will revert to IR. IR has confirmed
that, within the constraints of its financial code, prices of IRWA products
will be guided by the same principles which guide JPC in setting prices for
other Indian suppliers of wheels and axles. In response to a suggestion that
the charging point for dividend on capital-at-charge might be embodied in
IR's manufactured products such as wheels and axles at the point of production,
and that the transfer prices charged for such products should reflect this,
IR has given assurances to bring this issue to the attention of the Railway
Convention Committee. During negotiations targets for production build-up at
IRWA were discussed and confirmed by IR.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During credit negotiations, agreements were reached on the follow-
ing principal matters:
(a) GOI would fix such transfer prices for the supply of wheels
and axles to be produced at the Yelahanka Plant as shall be
sufficient to cover direct manufacturing costs, overhead
costs and full depreciation (para. 2.28);
(b) GOI would by December 31, 1978, cause to be prepared and
furnished to the Association, a training program satisfactory
to the Association for the training of technical staff and
work force to be employed at the Yelahanka Plant, and shall
implement said training program (para 3.33);
(c) IR would carry out a workshop modernization and rationaliza-
tion program in accordance with a Plan of Action agreed
upon between GOI and the Association (para 3.40);



- 44 -
(d)  IR would employ experts whose qualifications, experience and
terms and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to
the Borrower and the Association (para 3.41);
(e)  GOI would ensure that the Yelahanka Plant shall at all times
carry on its operations, manage its affairs and maintain its
financial position in accordance with sound engineering,
financial and administrative practices, including an appro-
priate management information system, and with adequate
staff under the supervision of experienced and competent
management (para 3.42);
(f)  GOI would ensure that when the lowest evaluated bidder is a
foreign manufacturer, permission to import will be forthcoming
immediately and no further review by any agency of the Govern-
ment will be made (para 3.44); and
(g)  GOI would maintain passenger fares and freight rates and
take all other actions as may be necessary or appropriate so
as to provide to the Railways net revenue sufficient to enable
the Railways to meet out of internally generated resources all
operating expenses and dividend payments on capital-at-charge
(para 5.18).
6.02      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit
of US$190 million to the Government of India.

1.   Fixed Assets
The value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet is their
original cost, except that additional cost of like-forlike replacements over
their original cost (the inflationary element) is charged against DRF.  The
full cost of all assets including the additional cost of replacemenrts is
Rs 65,244 million. Included in this total are works in progress, land and
other non-depreciable assets amounting to Rs 9,549 million. The book value
of depreciable assets is:

2.   Depreciation Reserve Fund
This balance in the fund represents cumulative contributions to
date iess (a) cost of assets withdrawn from services, and (b) full cost of
replacement.
3.   Inventories
These are financed from Capital-at-Charge.
4.   Investment Financed from Railway Sources
These are the published figures representing amounts the railways
provided from their own sources over the years towards the Capital investment
programs. Although, in 1976-77 the railways have been able to show a net
surplus of Rs 872 million after payment of dividend to general revenue, in
the earlier years net earnings were insufficient to meet the full cost of
expenditure charged to the Development Fund and the full dividend payment due
to the Government. Consequently, in order to meet these shortfalls, Indian
Railways has drawn temporary loans from the Central Government to ensure that
its funds did not become overdrawn. The outstanding temporary loans at
March 31, 1977, which have been drawn to augment the fund balances, as shown
in Indian Railways' balance sheet only by way of note and are as follows:

INDIA
A RAILWAY MODERNIZATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT
IR Revenue and Expenditure Forecast 1977/78-1982/83
1.        The prices used in the forecasts for freight rates, passenger fares
and operating costs are at April 1978 levels.
2.        The estimates, therefore, take account of the three major influences
which have occurred over the past three years:
(a) the revision of tariffs which resulted in increases
in both freight rates and fares during the period
1974-76 and discussed earlier in this report;
(b) increased cost of fuel and coal, repairs and main-
tenance and consumable stores; and
(c) the wage awards and dearness allowances sanctioned by GOI,
the lastest being effective from September 1, 1977.
3.        The revenue forecasts only reflect the increase in traffic antici-
pated during the period 1978/79-1982/83. They do not take account of any
further adjustment in tariff and fare levels.
4.        Working expenses are based on a detailed analysis of 1978/79 budget
data, related to freight and passenger traffic forecasts for that base year
and then projected as a constant ratio between the three main elements:
Item                      _
Personnel                    60.0
Fuel                         19.4
Other costs and stores       20.6
5.        Depreciation provisions are based on a total appropriation of
Rs 10,500 million for the five year period of the plan, 1978/79-1982/83.
This compares favorably with Rs 6,500 million agreed in Credit 582-IN for
the period 1974/75-1978/79.
6.        Total revenue is projected to increase by 22.6% during the period
1978/79-1982/83. Passenger revenue is forecast conservatively to increase
at an average rate of about 4% per annum. Revenue-earning freight traffic is
projected to increase from 214 million tons in 1978/79 to 276 million tons by
1982/83, an increase of some 29%. The increase in freight revenues, reflect
traffic volume increases only 23.7%. The revenue and expenditure forecast
indicates that, given the need for an adequate replacement plan, the projected
investment of Rs 32,250 million during 1978/79-1982/83 is a maximum.



Table 19
Page 3
7.        In forecasting working expenses, IR have calculated on a ratio of
variable to fixed expenditure of 78.5:21.5 and applied this to an analysis
of goods and passenger traffic volume. This was based on the 1978/79 budget
figures and therefore, again reflects prices at April 1978. The assumption
that about 78% of expenses vary directly with traffic growth may be exces-
sive; but nonetheless, for appraisal purposes, it is considered prudent and
realistic to accept expenditure estimates on this conservative basis.
8.        For freight traffic, the average annual growth in revenues from
1977/78 is about 4.74% (Table 19, page 4) and for passenger traffic, some
4% per annum over 1977/78 revised estimate figure. The volume of freight
traffic in terms of ton-km is expected to increase by 4.3% annually. Average
receipt per ton-km of freight was Paise 8.86 in 1976/77, and average receipt
per pass-km was 3.47 in 1976/77. These rates have been adopted for estimat-
ing earnings up to 1982/83 without any increase in freight and passenger
fares.
9.        Operating expenses are based on a detailed analysis of 1978/79
budget data, related to freight and passenger traffic forecasts for that
base year and projections for following years take account of the forecast
steady growth in traffic. Working expenses (excluding DRF and PF) in
1982/83 have been assessed at a level of about 19% higher than in 1977/78
while traffic growth in terms of train movements is likely to increase by
some 21%.

(a) carrying out a complete inventory of maintenance,
manufacturing and other activities of all workshops,
sheds and manufacturing units, with a view to arriving
at the optimum assignment of activities and workload
to each unit in order to minimize duplication of
facilities and efforts;
(b) developing a plan for location, organization, capacity,
layout and equipment required to establish facility(s)
needed for remanufacturing of parts and components
required to effect a unit exchange maintenance and
periodic overhaul program for motive power, coaches and
electric multiple-unit fleet;
(c) developing the required level of parts and components,
new and remanufactured, to implement unit-exchange
maintenance and improved periodic overhaul practice for
rolling stock and motive power;
(d)  developing the required plant and machinery for Phase II
and Phase III of the workshop modernization program;
(e) developing the additional facilities and equipment
required by the manufacturing units to supply the new
parts and components needed for maintenance;
(f) developing an optimum and integrated materials
management system for the unit-exchange maintenance
and periodic overhaul program;
(g) recommending the organizational changes, staffing,
accounting and management information system needed to
institute and control integrated maintenance and periodic
overhaul of motive power and rolling stock including an
integrated materials management system; and
(h) developing the timetable and technical and economic
analysis of Phase II and Phase III of the workshop
rationalization and modernization program.
