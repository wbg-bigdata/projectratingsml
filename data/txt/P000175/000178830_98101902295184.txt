INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Burundi for the equivalent of US$14.0
million to help finance a Second Highway Project. The Arab Bank for Economic
Development in Africa (BADEA) will participate in the financing of the project
with US$6.1 million. The Federal Republic of Germany and the UNDP will provide
a grant of about US$800,000 and US$900,000 equivalent, respectively.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic report on Burundi (504a-BU) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on January 14, 1975. This was followed by an
economic memorandum (855a-BU) distributed on October 24, 1975. An economic
mission visited Burundi in June-July 1977 and is preparing an updating
memorandum which is expected to be circulated to the Executive Directors by
April 1978. Updated country data are provided in Annex I.
3.        On November 1, 1976, the Army dismissed the regime that had been
in power since 1966 and suspended the Constitution. The new Government has
stated that it will pursue policies of sound economic management and national
unity in respect of ethnic and regional differences and emphasize rural devel-
opment. Project implementation and the preparation of new projects are being
accelerated.
4.        Burundi is one of the 25 least developed countries as defined by
the United Nations. It has a per capita income estimated at US$120 in 1976.
Over the past five years GDP has grown by no more than 2 percent annually in
real terms. Of a population of 3.8 million, only 121,000 are in wage employ-
ment; the remainder depends mainly on subsistence agriculture. The agricul-
tural labor force is largely untrained, and the level of enrollment in formal
education is one of the lowest in Africa.
5.        The economy is dominated by the agricultural sector.  Food crops
account for about half of GDP; other crops, of which coffee remains by far
the most important, account for a further 4 percent. In the 1974/75 coffee
season, production reached a record of about 28,000 tons, 31 percent higher
than the preceding year. The large harvest combined with a higher producer
price resulted in a 62 percent increase in farmer incomes derived from coffee
with consequent multiplier effects in both industry and services. Production



-2-
in 1975/76 fell sharply to about 17,000 tons adversely affecting rural in-
comes, but in 1976/77 increased to 21,000 tons yielding about US$50.0 mil-
lion of export revenues as a result of the markedly higher coffee prices
in the world market following the frost damage to Brazil's coffee trees.
Farmers' income improved when the Government adjusted the producer price
from BuF 39 per kg in 1975 to BuF 65 per kg in 1976. In view of expected
higher world market prices for this commodity for the 1977/78 season, the
Government has recently raised producer prices again to BuF 112 per kg.
As the volume of coffee production during the present season could attain
20,000 tons, small farmers, for whom coffee constitutes the main cash crop,
could substantially increase their inrco"e from this commodity.
6.        Burundi's coffee production has become increasingly important for
its foreign exchange earnings; the share of coffee in total exports rose from
79 percent in 1965 to 89 percent in 1976. The higher coffee prices have
greatly strengthened Burundi's balance of payments. By the end of March 1977,
net international reserves stood at a level equivalent to about nine months
of merchandise imports. Rising import prices, combined with increased internal
demand, caused a record 16 percent jump in the cost of living index for
low income urban families during 1975. During 1976, price increases have
been moderate, averaging about 7 percent. However, the impact on domestic
demand of significantly higher export revenues expected in 1977/78 could exert
inflationary pressures unless it is counteracted by an increase in imports.
The Government intends to follow a liberal though selective import policy in
order to prevent an upsurge in prices-
7.        The level of investment has remained consistently low, averaging
less than 10 percent of GDP between 1972 and 1976. Domestic savings have
amounted to only 4 percent of GDP over the same period, approximately equal
to net capital inflows. Close to half of total gross capital formation was
financed by external aid.
8.        Due to higher coffee prices, government revenues in 1976 were 60
percent above the level attained in 1975, while current expenditures grew by
only 31 percent. Although Government investment rose considerably in 1976,
budgetary savings financed about 54 percent of the latter compared to a low
7 percent the year before.
9.        Burundi faces a formidable set of disadvantages, including depen-
dence on coffee as the single export for foreign exchange, long and inef-
ficient transport links for external trade, rudimentary infrastructure, and a
large untrained labor force. In the past, civil strife disrupted development
and diverted resources. The lack of a coherent development strategy was an
obstacle in overcoming these deficiencies. In the past year some encouraging
measures have been taken to address these problems. A Ministry of Planning
has been established; improvements are being made in financial administration;
and a number of agricultural projects are under preparation. The Ministry of
Planning, whose staff is being strengthened with IDA assistance, has embarked
on the preparation of a comprehensive development plan and is initiating and
monitoring new projects and coordinating external aid.



-3-
10.       The short term prospects for the economy are favorable, as coffee
prices are expected to remain at substantially higher levels than before 1976.
However, coffee prices are expected to decline again and in the medium term
the balance of payments is likely to become a serious constraint to the Govern-
ment's intention of significantly increasing investment expenditures. If the
Government continues to focus on development and strengthen its administration,
it may achieve steady, albeit slow, improvement in per capita incomes. If
mining of Burundi's nickel deposits proves feasible the prospects over the
next ten years would be much better. However, although such a development
appears technically possible, the commercial viability of exploiting these
deposits has yet to be established. Regional development in Central Africa
will also be important to Burundi's economy. On September 20, 1976, Burundi,
Rwanda and Zaire signed a convention establishing the "Economic Community of
the Countries of the Great Lakes." The Community, which has its seat in
Gisenyi, Rwanda, aims inter alia at stimulating and intensifying intra regional
trade and cooperation in a wide range of activities. Preparation of a regional
power project and a cement factory are underway and discussions are being held
to facilitate the circulation of persons and goods within the Community.
11.       Disbursements of official loans and grants have averaged US$16.7
million p.a. during 1974-75, the main contributions coming from Belgium,
the UN agencies, IDA and the European Development Fund. Technical assis-
tance has accounted for about half this aid. In the 1972-76 period, total
net foreign capital inflows amounted to about US$80 million, of which US$66
million was in grants. On December 31, 1976, Burundi's external medium
and long-term debt amounted to about US$23.7 million excluding undisbursed
amounts. Of this the Bank and IDA together held 21 percent. Debt service
averaged 4.4 percent of export earnings during 1972-76, with the Bank Group
receiving 28 percent of all debt service payments. Due to the large grant
element in external assistance, the Bank Group will probably continue to
hold an important proportion of Burundi's debt as well as be the recipient
of a large share of its debt service. Notwithstanding the low debt service
ratio, however, the country, because of its poverty and instability of its
export earnings, is not able to absorb any borrowing on commercial terms.
External aid should be on grant or very concessional terms and continue to
include a substantial share of local cost financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.       Since independence, nine credits have been made to Burundi,
totaling US$34.1 million. The first credit for US$1.1 million was made in
1966 for the rehabilitation and extension of Bujumbura's water supply sys-
tem. A credit of US$1.8 million was made in 1969 for the improvement of
smallholder coffee production, followed by a second credit of US$5.2 million
for the same purpose in November 1975. The latter project is cofinanced by
the Kuwait Fund and Belgium in an aggregate amount of about US$1.8 million.
A credit of US$5.0 million made in 1974 for a highway maintenance project was
based on an engineering and highway maintenance study financed with a
US$380,000 credit made in 1970.  In 1976, a Technical Assistance credit



of US$1.5 million was made to help strengthen planning, statistical services
and project preparation as well as a US$6.0 million credit for a Fisheries
Development Project to increase fish production from Lake Tanganyika and
prepare rural development projects. The Fisheries Project is _ofirnanced
by a US$1.2 million loan from the Abu Dhabi Fund. A US$10.0 million credit
was made in April, 1977 to help finance a primary education project and a
US$3.4 million credit was made on September 30, 1977 to assist the National
Economic Development Bank. Project execution is generally slow and disburse-
ments have been limited, mainly because most projects started fairly recently.
Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of December 31, 1977
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects, including the status of
commitments and disbursements.
13.       Execution of the Highway Maintenance Project has resulted in the
reorganization of manual road maintenance which has substantially improved
the quality of road maintenance throughout the country. The improvement of
mechanized maintenance was delayed because of a procurement problem which was
resolved in 1977. Since then, the Ministry of Public Works has accelerated
the establishment of mechanized maintenance crews for periodic regravelling to
halt a rapid deterioration of part of the road network. Training of road
maintenance personnel has been satisfactory (see para. 21). The project is
now well underway and expected to be completed on schedule by mid 1978.
14.       In line with the Government's development strategy, the emphasis
of the future lending program focusses on improving the road network and on
increasing agricultural productivity to improve the nutrition and living
standards of the impoverished rural population. With the assistance of our
Resident Mission in Eastern Africa, the Government is preparing a rural
development project which would include the establishment of several agricul-
tural development centers in selected parts of the country. This project
would be a first phase of a larger program to accelerate development of the
rural areas. In addition, the lending program includes further assistance to
help Burundi improve primary and technical education, planning and project
preparation. We also intend to provide further assistance to industrial
development by supporting the activities of the National Economic Development
Bank.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
15.       Burundi's terrain is very rugged, making transport difficult.  There
are no railways, road construction is costly and the road system is poorly
developed. The economy, however, is heavily dependent on roads for trans-
portation in areas not served by Lake Tanganyika. Almost all exportimport
traffic is by lake from Bujumbura to Kigoma in Tanzania, and then by rail to
Dar es Salaam on the Indian Ocean. While there are other routes both
to the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans, they are at present less reliable and
more costly. An international airport at Bujumbura serves large jet aircraft,
and there are six small airstrips scattered throughout the country.



- 5 -
16.       Although the road network is extensive, totalling about 5,500 km,
it consists mostly of low standard earth and gravel roads. Some 3,000 km
of the road network, including the more important national roads of which
about 200 km are presently paved, are under the responsibility of the Min-
istry of Public Works. The remaining 2,500 km consist mainly of earth tracks
which carry little traffic and are maintained by local authorities.
17.       Traffic in Burundi is relatively light and concentrated on the main
roads radiating from Bujumbura. During 1976, only 11 percent of Burundi's
road network carried more than 50 vehicles a day. The vehicle fleet, now
totalling about 7,000 vehicles mostly consisting of passenger cars and small
trucks, is increasing at an annual rate of about 7 percent. During the rainy
season, traffic on steeply graded road sections is hampered by heavy erosion
and bridges in poor state of repair are often carried away by floods.
18.       Burundi's principal outlet is the port of Dar es Salaam at a dis-
tance of about 1400 km. Transport between Bujumbura and Dar es Salaam
typically takes about two months although the distance could be covered in a
much shorter time under better operating conditions. The capacity of the
railway is adversely affected by poor management, inadequate maintenance and
insufficient investment, and timely exportation of Burundi's coffee production
is often hampered. An alternate outlet through Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya to
Mombasa, although longer in distance, could become more attractive in the
future as national highways in these areas are being improved.
19.       The Ministry of Public Works is responsible for the design, con-
struction and maintenance of national roads. Two departments within the
Ministry deal with various aspects of road administration. The Department
of Planning and Design supervises feasibility studies and detailed engi-
neering and administers all construction contracts. The Roads Department
executes minor construction works and is responsible for all aspects of
road maintenance.
20.       The Ministry of Public Works suffers from a shortage of techni-
cally trained personnel. At present only the Minister and the Directors
of the Department of Planning and Design, the Roads Department and the
superintendent in charge of road maintenance have a formal education in
engineering. Eleven technical assistants fill the more important positions
in the Ministry and although the Government is making serious efforts to
overcome the shortage of Burundi nationals, it will for the duration of the
proposed project remain dependent on foreign technical staff to strengthen
its highway administration.
21.       During the execution of the Highway Maintenance Project (Credit
467-BU) satisfactory progress was made in training road maintenance per-
sonnel. A special training program has been started under the project
at the School of Public Works which turns out four to six Burundi techni-
cians per year at the superintendent level. For those who qualify the
training program is followed by more advanced studies abroad, generally
financed by bilateral aid. Eventually, this program would also provide



- 6 -
adequately trained Burundi instructors to carry on the training program. A
problem has arisen in that students returning to Burundi from courses abroad
are frequently absorbed by the private sector. To correct this situation the
Government has decreed that students obtaining Government fellowships for
training abroad are obliged to serve in the Government, including the Ministry
of Public Works, for a period of ten years.
22.       Minor construction works are carried out satisfactorily on force
account by the Roads Department. Larger works are awarded to foreign con-
tractors, one of which has established an office in Burundi.  Thus far, lack
of capable technicians, skilled workers and managers have hindered the devel-
opment of a local construction industry, although there should be opportuni-
ties for small gtoups of organized workers to undertake some construction
work.
23.       Under the present Highway Maintenance Project the consultants
BERGER/BCEOM have assisted the Government in developing a 10-year road
investment program (1978-87). The consultants have recommended that by
1987 about 600 km of earth tracks should be improved to low standard earth
and gravel roads, in particular to improve access to rural areas. In addi-
tion, the Government is planning to upgrade about 600 km of the road network
to paved standard. This program includes the construction to paved standard
of two partially competing north-south roads, namely the Bujumbura-Rutovu and
the Gitega-Kihofi roads which end about 20 km from each other after passing
through adjacent, agricultural areas. The Bujumbura-Rutovu road will be
constructed with financial and technical assistance provided by the People's
Republic of China whereas the Federal Republic of Germany has been requested
to finance the Gitega-Kihofi road.
24.       Simultaneous construction of the above roads is justified by the
Government on the grounds that both roads would open up agriculturally rich
areas with potential for sugar production and cattle raising. In addition,
the Gitega-Kihofi road would provide access to the area where nickel resources
have been found, the possible exploitation of which could induce a substantial
incremental demand for road transport. On the other hand simultaneous con-
struction would make heavy demands on the Government not only by utilizing
scarce resources, but also by increasing recurrent road maintenance expendi-
tures. The Government has discussed the proposed road construction plans with
the Federal Republic of Germany and the Association. in addition, the Govern-
ment has agreed to submit to the Association not later than April 30, 1978, a
road investment program, exchange views with the Association thereon, give the
Association an opportunity to comment on the proposed modifications thereto,
and review its execution with the Association from time to time (Section 4.02
of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
25.       A National Road Fund was established in 1969 to help finance capi-
tal expenditures in the highway sector. The Fund's resources consist mainly
of taxes on fuel. Additional revenues are derived from taxes on vehicles,



spare parts and registration fees. In 1976, total revenues collected
from road users amounted to about US$2.5 million. However, only part of
these revenues were used to meet the Government's annual highway expenditures.
Budget provisions for road maintenance have been consistently below require-
ments, despite several recommendations by the Association to the Government
to increase the budget. On the basis of current estimates of road maintenance
needs, the Government would have to set the 1978 budget at a minimum of
US$2.5 million equivalent followed by annual adjustments for inflation, price
variations and changes in traffic patterns (Section 4.05 of the draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement).
26.       More than half of the entire road maintenance budget is being
allocated to meet expenditures resulting from the maintenance of the town-
ship roads of Bujumbura, occupying about 65 percent of the equipment at
the disposai of the Ministry of Public Works. This practice is detrimental
to the maintenance of the national road network. In order to strike a better
balance between the maintenance of township and national roads, the Govern-
ment is taking measures to establish, by June 30, 1978, two separate mainte-
nance departments within the Ministry of Public Works: one responsible for
township roads, and another for the national and secondary roads in Burundi
(Section 4.05 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Highway Project, Burundi"
(No. 1656-BU) dated February 8, 1978 is being circulated separately. The
project is in part the continuation of the highway maintenance program started
under the first highway project (Credit 467-BU, 1974) which was prepared by
consultants DIWI (Germany) in 1970-71 under an engineering credit (US$380,000,
Credit S11-BU, 1970). The feasibility studies of the Bujumbura-Cibitoke-
Rugombo road were prepared by consultants BCEOM-BERGER with financing from the
first highway project, and detailed engineering was done by consultants DIWI
with Government financing. Consultants BCEOM-BERGER also prepared the road
improvement component of the project. The project was appraised in February
1977. Negotiations were held in Washington from December 5 to 9, 1977. The
Burundi delegation was led by H. E. Isidore Nyaboya, Minister of Public Works,
Equipment and Housing. Representatives from the Arab Bank for Economic
Development in Africa (BADEA) and the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW)
attended part of the negociations.
The Project
28.       The project which is to be carried out in four years would consist
of:
(i)  construction of the Bujumbura-Cibitoke-Rugombo road (65 km)
to two-lane bituminous standards;
(ii) improvement of Burundi's classified road network through:



(a)  replacement of about 21 wooden bridges by concrete
structures;
(b) stabilization of selected steep road sections; and
(c) improvement of 430 km of secondary roads to low
standard gravel and improved earth surface.
(iii) consultant services (i) to supervise construction of the
Bujumbura-Cibitoke-Rugombo road, (ii) to prepare detailed
engineering and supervise the construction of bridges and
improvement of roads and (iii) to continue the technical
assistance to the Ministry of Public Works to improve
road maintenance operations;
(iv) procurement of road maintenance equipment to replace existing
equipment near the end of its economic life and to provide
adequate capacity for mechanized road maintenance; and
(v) improvement of the soils and materials laboratory of the
Ministry of Public Works through technical assistance for
training local laboratory personnel, provision of laboratory
equipment and vehicles and reconstruction of the laboratory
building.
Detailed Features
29.       Main Road Construction.  The main road construction would consist
of the Bujumbura-Cibitoke - Rugombo road. The present road which passes
through the agriculturally rich Ruzizi Valley is in poor condition. In periods
of heavy rainfall the road is nearly impassable as a result of flooding. To
correct this situation major earthworks will be carried out, structures will be
replaced and drainage facilities improved. The road will be constructed to two
lane bituminous paved standards. Detailed engineering of the road from Bujumbura
to Rugombo which was carried out by consultants financed from government funds,
is satisfactory. Contractors for the construction of the road have already
been qualified and tenders will be called shortly.
30.       The Ruzizi Valley provides a major part of Bujumbura's food supplies
and is also the main cotton producing area. Although cotton production
has declined over the past years, the government intends to encourage produc-
tion to serve a textile mill being built in Bujumbura with Chinese financing.
The construction of the Bujumbura-Cibitoke-Rugombo road would greatly faci-
litate the transport of agricultural products. Presently, the road carries
up to 300 vehicles per day.
31.       Improvement of Roads and Bridges.  The road improvement program
will consist of the upgrading of about 57 km of earth tracks to low standard
gravel roads and about 370 km to improved earth roads. Improvement of earth
roads would be limited to improving drainage facilities and the road surface.

No major earthworks are envisaged. Design and specifications will be pre-
pared with a view to encourage the use of manual labor where possible. About
21 wooden bridges on economically important roads which are in poor state of
repair will be replaced by simple concrete structures.
32.       The improvement of the road network would accelerate the marketing
of foodcrops produced in the areas of influence of the roads and would facil-
itate the implementation of the Government's storage and marketing program.
This program is designed to promote the marketing of food supplies from sur-
plus areas to areas with chronic shortages thereby reducing the substantial
inter-regional price differences which occurred in the past as a result of
lack of storage facilities and proper means of transport. The production
of commercial crops such as coffee and tea which is entirely commercialized
would benefit considerably from the road improvement.
33.       Maintenance.  During the project period the highway maintenance
program, started in 1974, will be continued. Technical assistance will be
employed to strengthen the road maintenance capacity of the Ministry of
Public Works and for the training of Burundi nationals at the Public Works
Laboratory to improve its capacity to control the quality of road construc-
tion. The Federal Republic of Germany has agreed to continue its technical
assistance program to the mechanical workshop in Bujumbura for the duration
of the project.
34.       Consultants Services.  Consultants will be employed to supervise
the construction of the Burundi-Cibitoke-Rugombo road. Consultants will also
be hired to carry out detailed engineering for the improvement of roads and
bridges and to supervise their construction.
35.       Equipment.  To keep the capacity of mechanized road maintenance
units at an adequate level the project provides for the replacement of about
US$1.5 million of maintenance equipment purchased in the earlier phases of
the Highway Maintenance Project which will reach the end of its economic
life in 1980. In addition, the project provides for equipment and vehicles
for the public works laboratory, and rehabilitation of its quarters.
Execution of the Project
36.       The Ministry of Public Works will be responsible for the execution
of all project components. The construction of the Bujumbura-Cibitoke-Rugombo
road is expected to start in the second quarter of 1978 and should be com-
pleted after 30 months. The road improvement program is estimated to last
about 3-1/2 years starting mid-1978. The improvement of 370 km of earth
tracks and the construction of 21 bridges will be carried out by force
account. In the event of operational constraints, the Ministry of Public
Works will subcontract the construction of some bridges to Burundi contrac-
tors. The stabilization of steep grades and the upgrading of 57 km of earth
tracks to low standard gravel roads will be carried out by contractors.

Project Cost and Financing
37.       The total cost of the project, net of taxes and duties amounting
to aDout US$2.5 million equivalent, is estimated at US$24.0 million with a
foreign exchange component of US$18.4 million (or 77 percent). The proposed
IDA Credit of US$14.0 million would finance 58 percent of the total project
cost net of taxes.
38.       The Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) is expected
to provide US$6.1 million (or 25 percent of the total project cost net of
taxes) on terms to be agreed to finance part of the main road construction and
part of the cost of supervision. The Federal Republic of Germany has agreed
to provide a grant of about US$800,000 for the continuation of the German
technical assistance. The UNDP will contribute a grant of US$900,000 equiva-
lent for technical assistance to help the Government execute the project.
Total external financing will thus amount to IJS$21.8 million or about 91
percent of total project cost net of taxes. Because of Burundi's limited
financial resources in the medium and long term such a high percentage of
external cost sharing as well as the financing of US$3.4 million of local
costs is justified (see paras. 10-11). The effectiveness of the BADEA loan
agreement will be a condition of disbursement for expenditures for the main
road construction (para. 4 of Schedule 1 to the draft Development Credit
Agreement).
The detailed financing plan for all project costs (net of taxes) is
as follows:
Local   Foreign   Total       _
(US$ Million)-----
Government                       2.2      -         2.2        9

5.6     18.4      24.0     100
Budget and Organization
39.       Since Government revenues from road user charges and fuel taxes
are adequate to cover all recurrent maintenance expenditures and since no
increase of maintenance capacity is proposed under the project, no provision
has been made to finance fuel, materials and spare parts. Therefore, in
addition to its US$2.2 million contribution (net of taxes) to the project
cost, the Ministry of Public Works has budgeted an estimated minimum of US$2.5
million equivalent per year starting 1978 to finance recurrent maintenance
expenditures. The Government will be required to maintain the recurrent
maintenance budget at least at this level during the remaining years of the
execution of the project and to discuss the adequacy of this amount with the



- 11l -
Association each year before October 31, taking into account such factors as
inflation, price variations and changing traffic patterns and volume (Section
4.05 (d) and (e) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). By June 30, 1978
the Government will provide a plan of action to establish two separate depart-
ments within the Ministry of Public Works for the maintenance of Bujumbura's
township roads and the national road network, with separate budgets, staff and
equipment and thereafter carry out such plans (Section 4.03 of the draft
Development Credit Agreement; see paras. 25-26).
Procurement
40.       The contracts for the main road construction (US$ 11.5 million),
road maintenance equipment, the stabilization of steep grades and the up-
grading of the 57 km of earth tracks to low standard gravel roads will be let
following international competitive bidding. Prequalification of contractors
for the main road construction is being carried out by the Government. Should
the list of prequalified contractors be acceptable to both IDA and BADEA, the
construction of the road will be financed jointly. Otherwise, two separate
contracts for distinct road sections would be concluded. The improvement of
370 km of earth tracks and the construction of 21 bridges and the reconstruc-
tion of the laboratory building will be carried out by force account.
Disbursements
41.       The proceeds of the Credit will be disbursed over a period of
4 years against:
(a) 45 percent of the total expenditures of the civil works
for the main road construction;
(b) 80 percent of the total expenditures for the improvement
of the road network;
(c) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 80 percent of
local expenditures for road maintenance equipment;
(d) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 65 percent of
local expenditures for consultants services.
Economic Justification and Benefits
42.       The economic rate of return for the main road construction averages
about 16 percent, including 18 percent for the section Bujumbura-Kihanga, 16
percent for the section Kihanga-Cibitoke and 12 percent for the section
Cibitoke-Rugombo. If induced traffic is not taken into account or construc-
tion costs increase by 20 percent, the average rate of return on the construc-
tion of the entire road would be 15% and 13% and still be justified. The
improvement of wooden bridges and steeply graded road sections would have
returns of at least 12%. The improvement to gravel or improved earthroad
standards of about 430 km of roads selected under the road investment program
will yield economic returns in excess of 20% due to vehicle operating cost
savings from n.ormal and induced traffic. As regards the highway maintenance



- 12 -
component, a reevaluation was made of the highway maintenance program as a
whole including the achievements of the first phase and a reassessment of
the vehicle operating cost savings. The economic rate of return of the entire
has been estimated to be at least 20 percent. The incremental retutiL on the
component included in the proposed project will therefore be substantially
higher than 20 percent. The combined effect of the implementation of the
proposed project would be a decline in the costs of internal road transport
and the assurance of all season access to rural areas and markets. The
project is therefore of great importance to the farmers in the areas of
influence of the improved roads.
Risks
43.       Because of the high return on road construction and improvement
in a country like Burundi, the risks are fairly limited. A major risk will
remain the willingness of the Burundi Government to provide sufficient budget
funds to meet recurrent expenditures for highway maintenance to secure the
investments made in the highway sector, as otherwise the improvements of the
road network would quickly deteriorate. We intend to maintain a continuous
dialogue with the Government on this matter to assure that sufficient funds
for highway maintenance are made available.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Burundi and the Association and, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Asso-
ciation are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
45.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III of this report.
46.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
47.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

Credit No. 467-BU       Highway Maintenance Project:  US$5.0 million of
March 27, 1974; Effective Date: August 22, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The Highway Maintenance Project is the first phase of a long-term
program to establish an efficient highway maintenance organization. The
project consists of the purchase of maintenance equipment, spare parts, fuel
and construction materials, the construction of a workshop and consultant
services for technical assistance and training, a study on the development of
the road sector and feasibility studies. The project is cofinanced by the
UNDP (US$1.05 million for technical assistance), Germany (US$1.33 million for
the construction of and technical assistance to the mechanical workshop in
Bujumbura) and Belgium (US$400,000 for local cost financing). A procurement
problem concerning the award of the contract for the purchase of 36 tipping
trucks (about US$1.3 million) caused some delays in the establishment of
mechanized maintenance units and the carrying out of periodic regravelling.
As a result credit disbursements were slower than anticipated. In addition,
about US$620,000 is committed for the purchase of materials. Otherwise,
execution of the project has generally been satisfactory. Several manual road
maintenance crews and one mechanized maintenance unit have been established
resulting in a substantial improvement in the quality of road maintenance
works. The construction of the workshop in Bujumbura has been completed.
Good progress has been made in training road maintenance personnel.
Credit No. 593-BU       Second Coffee Improvement Project:  US$5.2 million
of December 5, 1975;
Effective Date: October 7, 1976;
Closing Date: March 31, 1981
The Project is a continuation of the first Coffee Improvement
Project (US$1.8 million Credit No. 147-BU of April 11, 1969). It is being
co-financed by the Kuwait Fund (US$1.2 million) on a parallel basis and by
Belgium (about US$600,000). The Kuwait Fund finances the construction of
ten coffee washing stations, and Belgium assists in the carrying out of a
coffee research component. Although the start up of the project was slow
because of frequent changes in project management, project execution is
now well underway. Extension work is proceeding well and expanded to the

new areas covered by the project. The food crop component consisting of
a seed program, demonstration plots and fertilizer distribution has made
an encouraging start and is well received by the farmers. The construction
of coffee washing stations financed by the Kuwait Fund is slow because
of a lack of cement and materials.
Credit No. 613-BU       Technical Assistance Prolect:  US$1.5 million
of March 19, 1976; Effective Date: July 13, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
This project provides financing for hiring long term advisers and
short-term consultants to assist in planning, collection of statistics
and project preparation. So far two long term advisers (a senior economic
adviser and a statistical expert in the Ministry of Planning) are in post.
The Credit also finances an expert to study the possibilities for industrial
use of Burundi's peat resources. Experts to advise the Government on the
processing of nickel ore and on management of a public savings institution are
also being recruited. Several short-term studies and consultant services
relating to the preparation of projects in the agricultural sector are being
financed.
Credit No. 626-BU       Fisheries Development Project; US$6.0 million
of June 11, 1976; Effective Date: February 22, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
This project is designed to increase the production of fish through
the provision of training, equipment and materials to fishermen and to improve
the distribution of fish throughout Burundi. The project also provides for
the preparation of an integrated rural development plan for the coastal region
along Lake Tanganyika and the implementation of pilot development activities.
The project is co-financed by a US$1.2 million loan from the Abu Dhabi Fund
for Arab Economic Development. Project execution is underway but management
problems have arisen.
Credit No. 679-BU       Education Project:  US$10.0 million of April 28. 1977;
Effective Date: September 1, 1977
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
This project assists the Government in continuing and consolidating
the reform of primary education. It aims at substantially expanding primary
school enrollments and improving equal opportunity for education. It provides
technical and material assistance to the Rural Education Bureau responsible
for the execution of the reform of primary education as well as for teacher
training. Key staff is already in post and has made a satisfactory start with
project implementation.
Credit No. 731-BU       Development Bank Project; US$3.4 million of
September 30. 1977; Terminal Date of Effectiveness:
February 28, 1978; Closing Date: March 31, 1983.
This Credit is not yet effective.
