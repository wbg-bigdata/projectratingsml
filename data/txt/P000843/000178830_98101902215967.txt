INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPME  ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE ElECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA FOR A
LIVESTOCK DEViLOPENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Ghana for the equivalent of US$2.0 million on standard
IDA terms to help finance a livestock development project. About US$1.9
million of the proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Ghana Livestock
Company Limited for 16 years, including 6 years of grace, with interest.at
not less than 8 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
General
2.        The last economic report on Ghana (R72-223) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on October 3, 1972, and drew attention to the structural
problems of the economy. An industrial sector mission visited Ghana during
November 1973; its report is expected to be issued shortly. An economic mission
was in Ghana recently and its report should be available in early fall. Country
data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Gross domestic product in real terms in Ghana increased by about
2.5 percent a year between 1969 and 1972, whlle the population grew at rates
ranging from 2.6 percent to 3 percent. Ghana seemed to have been caught in
the downward economic spiral of declining per capita income and. consumption
affecting the capacity of the nation to save and invest. The Govermnent is
engaged in trying to break this cycle and is preparing a long-term development
strategy for growth with stability.
41.       On external account, Ghana's problem has been excessive dependence
on cocoa exports -- cocoa still accounts for about 70 percent of merchandise
exportg .  Accordingly, wh widely fluctuating cocoa price8 and Ghana's
declining share of worldwide production, the long-term balance of paymnts-
situation remains somewhat uncertain.
5.        On public finances, there has Deen a tendency for current budget
expenditures to rise at a rapid rate and to outstrip revenues which are overly
dependent on cocoa export duties and import taxes. In addition to the imbalance
in the government budget per se, there are a number of public agencies and
entexprises whose activities have not been subjected to adequate economic tests,
and which are dependent on budget support or bank borrowings.
6.        In describing these basic problems, the last economic report concluded
that, even with vigorous and determined policies on the part of the Governmeent,
the necessary structural adjustments cauld only be effected gradually. Ghana's
structural problems and slow growth should not obscure, however, the strong
points of its economy. Besides being the world's largest cocoa producing and



exporting country, Ghana has a variety of mineral resources as well as sub-
stantial timber reserves. There is a reasonably advanced infrastructure.
Cocoa production is broad-based and benefits many small farmers. The education
system is well established; elementary education has been free and universal
since 1962. Favorable external developments and government policy action over
the past two years have laid the basis for more secure and sustained development.
Ghana has achieved a reasonable degree of monetary stability, made a start in
putting its state industries on a sounder economic footing and exercised caution
in its public investment decisions.
7.        During 1972 and 1973 the balance of payments position improved
dramatically. Compared to a trade deficit of about $40 million in 1971, trade
surpluses of about $160 million in 1972 and $100 million in 1973 were achieved.
In 1972 this was in part due to the very substantial retrenchment in imports
following the reimposition of an import licensing system. While imports in
1973 were expanded to meet the production needs of the economy and to replenish
stocks, continuing high world prices for cocoa, gold and timber maintained a
trade surplus. In contrast with the practice in previous years, the surplus
has been used to repay some $40 million of Ghana's short-term debts and to bu.ild
up reserves which stood at about $200 million at the end of 1973, compared to
about $20 million at the end of 1971.
8.        While prospects for continued high world prices for cocoa and gold
seem good, the recent increasesi in petroleum prices are estimated to increase
Ghanals import bill by about $100 million and eliminate the anticipated
balance of payments surplus for 1974. Pe.troleum imports, which accounted for
less than one-tenth of total imports in 1970-72, would account for about 30
percent of imported goods in 15974. With the need to meet substantial payments
obligations and to maintain an adequate level of short-term debt repayment,
the overall balance of payments position is likely to become difficult once
again. Therefore, Ghana will need new aid commitments to supplement the ueagre
aid pipeline, and it is appropriate that a substantial part of;these ccmnitments
should be on concessionary terms.
9.        An agreement for a long-term rescheduling of Ghana's medium-term
external. debt was reached at a meeting in Rome March 11-13, 1974. Under this
agreement, which was announced by the Government of Ghana last April, all payments
due after February 1, 1972  in respect of pre-1966 debt obligations will be paid
over a period of 28 years, including a grace period of 10 years, with an interest
rate of 2 1/2 percent per annum. This concludes more than two years of negotia-
tions between Ghana and the creditor countries, in which the good offices of the
Bank were provided.  The rescheduling agreement is expected to go into effect
this summer provided the creditors are satisfied that the results of Ghana's
review of the contracts underlying the medium-tenm debts do not put in question
the basis of the debt settlement.   The review is to be completed by June 30, 197h.
The exact impact which the Rome agreement will have on Ghana's future debt service
obligations will of course depend on the outcome of this review.  It will be
affected as well by the extent of the implementation of the agreement and its
application to creditor countries not represented at the Rome meeting. These
cannot be ascertained now but, given the size of Ghana's debt obligations, the
relief obtained should prove to be substantial.



-3-
10.       In December 1972 the Government announced a new investment policy
redefining the ground rules for foreign private investnent in Ghana with a
view to encouraging more indigenous participation in those sectors which exert
a major influence on the economy. The Government is currently engaged in
negotiating compensation arrangements with the affected parties; some settle-
ments have already been reached.
11.       On the basis of the understandings reached at the Rome meeting, and
on the assumption that a substantial part of Ghana's external borrowing require-
ments will be covered by aid on concessional terms, it is estimated that Ghana's
external debt service ratio will average about 5-6 percent in 1974-76 and rise
to some 10-12 percent during the remainder of this decade. The Bank Group's
share of Ghana's total external debt is currently about 12 percent and is
expected to rise but still remain small (14 percent) in relation to other
lenders over the next several years. Similarly, the Bank Group's proportion
of Ghana's future debt service is estimated to average 9-11 percent in the
near future. Bank Group lending to Ghana since 1969 has been exclusively on
IDA tenms because of the large overhang of external debt service inherited
from the early 1960s. The agreement to reschedule service of most of the
medium-tenr suppliers' credits should open up possibilities for Ghana to
borrow abroad on conventional tenms, and it is planned to resume Bank lending
to Ghana in the near future.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GHANA
12        The Bank Group has lent Ghana $113.3 million, of which $47 million
was a Bank loan for the Volta Dam and associated infrastructure in 1962. The
remainder has been lent since 1968 for agriculture, power, water supply and
sewerage and roads projects. Annex II contains a summary statement of loans
and credits as of April 30, 1974 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
There are now no major problems in project implementation.
13.       Ghana is currently engaged in a major task of restructuring its
economy, particularly to achieve greater self-sufficiency in agricultural
products. Future Bank Group lending will support this objective, as reflected
in the proposed livestock project as well as an oil palm project which was
negotiated recently. A cotton project and a rice project have been appraised
and are expected to be presented for consideration by the Executive Directors
in FY 1975. Follow-up projects in cocoa and fisheries are planned thereafter,
Apart from agriculture, the findings of the industrial sector mission have
indicated favorable prospects for possible lending for small-scale industry.
In addition, while proportionately less future Bank Group assistance than in the
past is planned for infrastructural improvements, some additional lending is
contemplated in this field to support key institutions. The Bank is assisting
Ghana in preparing telecommunications, power generation and distribution,
highway maintenance and feeder road projects.

PART III - LIVESTOCK IN GHANA
14.       Agriculture accounts for 40 percent of Ghana's gross domestic
product and 70 percent of foreign exchange earnings, employs 60 percent
of its labor force and provides 80 percent of the raw materials consumed
by its manufacturing industry. Animal husbandry contributes a little less
than 5 percent of agricultural output.
15.       An immediate and overriding objective of the Ghana Government is
to encourage increased production and efficient marketing of basic foodstuffs,
and the two recent national budgets reflect this emphasis. One major aspect
of this effort concerns the supply of livestock products. Although Ghana has
the potential for substantial domestic production, imports from other West
African countries have accounted for over half of Gbanals meat consumption.
Foreign exchange difficulties have markedly affected the imports of meat, and
future supplies from the Sahelian countries are threatened by the effects of
recent droughts.
16.       Ghana's livestock population is roughly estimated at 700,000 cattle,
800,000 sheep, 750,000 goats and 115,000 pigs. The country's natural pasture
areas could support three to four times more animals than the present numbers.
Almost 70 percent of the country consists of thinly populated savannah which
is more suitable for cattle grazing than most of the rangeland found in the
countries that traditionally supply Ghana with meat.
17.       There bave been several obstacles to the development of a cmonmercial
livestock industry in Ghana. The productivity of the national herd is low and
farmers lack both the technical knowledge and the access to credit for improving
it. The offtake from the national herd is less than one-third of the offtake
in developed countries and lower than in the Sahelian countries. Perhaps the
most important long-term restraint on beef production in Ghana is the tsetse-
fly which, in varying degrees, infests most of the country.  Presently, acute
trypanosomiasis is rare because most of the cattle are trypano-tolerant and
graze only in areas with little or no tsetse challenge.  Over the long-term,
the disease could pose a serlous threat to any large-scale expansion of the
cattle industry until tsetse-flies are eradicated or a more effective prophy-
lactic drug or vaccine is found. Meanwhile, breeding enterprises in tsetse
areas will have to rely on trypano-tolerant cattle, although fattening of
other types of cattle during a limited period would be practicable, provided
grazing areas are suitably located and prophylactic or curative drugs are used.
18.       The national veterinary service covers the entire country and has
brought the principal epidemic diseases under control, and some experimental
data are available on improving local cattle through selection and cross-
breeding. The Government's State Farms Corporation and Ministry of Agriculture
have built up improved herds on a small scale. In these circumstances, the Bank
oif Gaina and the Agricultural Development Bank plan to undertake livestock
pro'iects; the commercial baiks, cattle dealers and livestock owners are interested
in expanding commercial production. The Government is anxious to provide a sound
basis for the growth of the industry. The proposed project would help the



Government to: (a) create the beginning of a modern livestock industry in Ghana;
(b) tap the resources of the commercial banks for livestock development;
and (c) establish improved methods of livestock production on private farms.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
19.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Livestock Development Project -
Ghana" (Report No. 277-GH, dated May 28, 1974) is being distributed separately.
A credit and project sumioary is provided in Annex III.
20.       The proposed project would be the Bank Group's first for livestock
development in Ghana. It was identified by the Ministry of Agriculture;
a feasibility study for the project, financed by France, was carried out by
French consultants (SEDES). The project was appraised by an IDA Mission in
February/March 1973 and discussed with the Government by an updating mission
which visited Ghana in December 1973.
21.       The project signifies an attempt to create a modern livestock
industry and to develop the country's potential for grassland beef production
by encouraging investments leading to the adaptation and dissemination of
livestock production techniques proven successful under similar ecological
conditions elsewhere in the world.  It is a pilot project fostering production
both in commercial ranches and in small and medium farms.
Project Description
22.       The project would produce improved breeding stock and slaughter
cattle, and would comprise:
(a) the rehabilitation and expansion of two existing ranches
and one maize farm to be taken over from the Government.
This part of the project would absorb the bulk of th4
proposed credit. The main developments would include land
clearing, fencing, watering facilities, improved pasture
and the purohase of breeding cattle;
(b) the improvement of some 50 privately-owned herds of about
10-400 head each in the areas surrounding the ranches.
The owners would be provided with technical advice and
finance for such items as improved breeding stock, fencing
materials, land clearing and pasture improvement;
(c) the training of Ghanaian ranch managers; and
(d) the identification of further ranch sites and the prepara-
tion of a second stage project.



23.       A newly formed enterprise, the Ghana Livestock Company Ltd. (GLC),
would carry out the project. The Ghana Commercial Bank, Barclays Bank of
Ghana and Standard Bank, Ghana, are expected to subscribe for shares and
debentures in GLC, and provide overdraft facilities, and the Agricultural
Development Bank is expected to subscribe for shares and debentures. Govern-
ment would be issued shares and debentures in exchange for the assets transferred
from the State Farms Corporation and the Ministry of Agriculture.  Although the
banks would hold a majority (60 percent) of the shares, Government would have a
controlling interest through its own shareholding and its ownership of the
Agricultural Development Bank and the Ghana Commercial Bank.
24.       The senior management of GW would include a Managing Director, three
Ranch Managers and a Chief Ao.untant.   The Rnnch Managers would be responsible
for dealings with surrounding farmers. Staff for these posts would be inter-
nationally recruited. Every attempt would be made to locate suitable Ghanaians,
but it is likely that some expatriates would be required.
Cost Estimate and Financial Arrangements
25.       The total project cost is estimated at US$4.5 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$2.0 million. The financing is expected to be provided
as follows:
US$ million
IIDA                                    2.0
Government                              0.6
Participating Banks                     0.9
GIL's retained income                   0.9
Farmers' contribution                   0.1
Total            4.5
The IDA credit of US$2.0 million would finance the foreign exchange costs which
amount to approximately 44 percent of total project cost net of taxes. The
Government contribution represents existing assets to be taken over by GLC.
26.       The Government would onlend about US$1.9 million of the proceeds of
the IDA credit to GLC at not less than 8 percent for a term of 16 years, including
six years of grace. The proceeds of the credit will also finance the cost of
preparation of a second livestock project (US$73,000) and training of Ghanaians
overseas (US$18,000). The banks would provide finance by way of equity con-
tributions, US$130,000 each, and the purchase of 8 percent debentures, US$43,000
each. The commercial banks would provide overdraft facilities at the interest
rate ruling from time to time. GLC would relend approximately $260,000 of the
credit to private farmers to finance 80 percent of investment costs, the
farmers contributing the other 20 percent. These loans would be at not less
than 2 percent above the Bank of Ghana's ruling rediscount rate (currently
6 percent) and would be for periods of up to 10 years, including up to 6 years
of grace.



-7-
Disbursement
27.       The proposed credit is expected to be disbursed during FYs 1975-79
(Annex III for details). As a condition of disbursement of the
portion of the credit to be onlent to GLC, 75 percent of the authorized share
capital of GLO will have to be issued and fully paid (See Section 2.02 of the
draft Development Credit Agreement).
Procurement
28.       International competitive bidding, in accordance with IDA guidelines,
would be used for aLl procurement contracts over US$50,000, which would include
the following goods and services: fencing materials, motor vehicles and other
mechanical and electrical equipment (about US$500,000) and contractors' services
for works such as land clearing, buildings, firebreaks and watering facilities
(about US$700,000). Local bidding procedures would be used for contracts of
less than US$50,Oo0 subject to a maxizum aggregate amount of US$350,000 (see
the Schedule ts the Project Agreement). There is adequate representation of
foreign suppliers in Accra to provide sufficient competition. Domestically
manufactured goods would be allowed up to a 15 percent preference. The services
of expatriate personnel and consultants, as well as overseas training, would
be arranged according to procedures acceptable to the Association.
29.       Competitive bidding would not be practicable for the procurement of
cattle for GLC and participating farmers (US$1.0 million), as the breeds suit-
able for CThanaian conditions can only be obtained locally thrcugh the traditional
trading system or through negotiated Government-to-Goveroment contracts, from
other West African countries. Competitive bidding for other goods to be procured
by participating farmers (US$186,000) is also not envisaged since most of the
items will be too small for such procurement (see Schedule to draft Project
Agreement).
Economic Evaluation
30.      At full development the annual output of the ranches and the
surrounding private herds is estimated at 950 breeding heifers, 600 male year-p
lings, 1,000 tons of carcass,meat and, from the Branamu ranch, 2,000 tons of
maize. The value of this output would be of the order of US$1.4 million, of
which US$0.9 mil-lion would represent foreign exchange savings.
31.       The project would provide valuable experience in pasture improvement,
cross-breeding, feeding and the integration of livestock produotion with maize
growing; it would help local farmers to raise their standards of management
and improve the quality of their cattle. Means of reaching larger numbers of
small cattle owners would be developed for a second stage project.
32.       The experience that would be gained in using imiproved techniques,
coupled with the training of Ghanaian ranch managers, muld help Ghana in
developing further commercial cattle production. By demonstrating the profita-
bility of good management practices, the project would stimDulate the interest
of cattle owners, private investors, and the commercial banks in such comercial
operations.



33.       The project's economic rate of return is estimated at 12 percent.
The financial rates of return for the new company and for the participating
livestock farmers are estimated at 14 percent and 17 percent respectively.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMETS AND AUTHORITY
34.       A draft Credit Agreement between the Republic of Ghana and the
Association, a draft Project Agreement between the Association and the
Ghana Livestock Company Limited, the recomendation of the Comaittee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d), of t:e Articles of Agreements of the Associa-
tion, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed development credit
are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECa4MXNDATION
37.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

B.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION  /
Credit No. 160 - Water Supply and Sewerage; US$3.5 million
Credit of August 25, 1969; Closing Date:  June 30, 1974
1.    This project comprised the extension of water distribution sys-
tem in the Accra/Tema metropolitan area and a new sewerage system
'in central Ac¢ra. These works are substantially completed. The credit
also included the improvement of the organization and operations of
the national authority responsible for Ghana's water supply and sevuerage
sector. The Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation is now functioning
with significantly improved management and satisfactory financial per-
formance. Only retention payments for contract services remain to be
made, for which the original Closing Date of June 30, 1973 was extended
to June 30, 1974.
Credit No. 163 - Fisheries; US$1.3 million Credit of
Setember 25, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
2.    This project was to have provided for (a) the construction of
forty purse seiners; (b) credits to fishermen for purchasing such
vessels; (c) fishing harbor improvement and expansion studies; and
(d) the improvement of the Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation's Boat-
yard Division. After protracted problems over the design and price
of the proposed boats, the procurement of their equipment is now vir-
tually concluded. All of the boats should have been sold and delivered
by now. Delays have also been encountered in the execution of the
harbor studies. Following a reduction in the objectives of the project,
the   Government has agreed to cancel the remaining proceeds of the
Credit except for those funds required to complete the final procure-
ment and the port studies. Meanwhile, IDA has been discussing with the
Government a thorough re-examination of the fisheries sector and iden-
tification of further investment needs for a possible second project.
The original Closing Date of December 31, 1972 was extended first to
December 31, 1973 and then to June 30, 1975.
Credit No. 205 - Cocoa Rehabilitation:   US$8.5 million Credit
of June 26, 1970; Closing Date:  December 31, 1976
3.    The project, principally involving the rehabilitation and re-
planting of 87,000 acres of cocoa plantings, is proceeding quite well.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors re-
garding the progress of projects in execution, and in particular
to report any problems which are being encountered, and the action
being taken to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and
with the understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced
evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Diring the first year of field works, the replanting targets were met
with excellent nursery practices. Control of swollen shoot virus disease
is similarly well ahead of project requirements.  However, the Sahelian
drought caused a reduction in the acreage of the 1972/73 replanting campaign
to 56 percent of the target. Lower annual replantings in the future are
likely in addition. A extension of the project period by one year on
this account is contemplated.   The rehabilitation component of the project
previously postponed is now underway. With the elimination of this dif-
ficulty, project disbursements should now proceed on the scheduled basis.
Credit No. 354 - Sugar Rehabilitation: US$15.6 million
Credit of January 29, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1979
4.    Work on the project is proceeding satisfactorily.  HVA Internationaal
has been assisting Ghana Sugar Estates Ltd. in the operation of the two
sugar factories and estates, and field plantings with effective results
to date. The Sugar Industry Committee has been established and ADB has
written off its unrecoverable debts. Field irrigation and drainage
systems are being rehabilitated and partially replanted. A survey in
August 1973 showed that the total outgrowers cane area covers about 4,000
acres more than estimated in the Appraisal Report. Both factories have
been overhauled and are expected to produce a larger output in the next
milling season. A considerable volume of project equipment has been
ordered, which should be reflected in sizeable project disbursements in
the near future.
Credit No. 438 - First Highway; US$13 million Credit of
November 21, 1973;   Closing Date:   December 31, 1977
5.    This project comprises rehabilitating and improving 13 sections of
trunk roads totalling some 345 miles; consultants for supervision of
construction, pre-investment studies for further road rehabilitation and
preparation of road maintenance project; and the provision of equipment
for traffic control and pavement surveys. The project became effective
in January 1974. Its implementation is underway, delayed only slightly
by the Government's move to establish an independent highway authority
which should improve the performance of the previous Government road
organization. Rehabilitation and other road improvements are expected to
start in November 1974, the beginning of the next dry season. A main-
tenance task force is scheduled to conclude its preliminary report in
JUly 19749.

Procurement Arrangements:     International competitive bidding, in accordance
with IDA guidelines, would be used for all
procurement contracts over US$50,000. Locally
advertised competitive bidding procedures would
be used for contracts of less than US$50,000
to an aggregate maximum of $350,000. Domestically
manufactured goods would be allowed up to a
15 percent preference in evaluating bids.
Competitive bidding would not be practicable for
the procurement of cattle, as the breeds suitable
for Ghanaian conditions can only be obtained
locally tbrough the traditional trading system
or through negotiated Government-to-Government
contracts, from neighboring West African countries.
Other goods to be procured by participating
farmers would also be exempt from competitive
bidding.
Expatriate Personnel and      Arrangements would be in accordance with
Overseas Training:         procedures acceptable to IDA.
Rate of Return:               The economic rate of return of the project is
estimated at 12 percent.
