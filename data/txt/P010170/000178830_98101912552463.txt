TEA REHABILITATION AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises a tea industry rehabilitation and diversifica-
tion project in Sri Lanka's tree crop sector. The project forms part of the
Government's development strategy which emphasizes restoring the productivity
of the export-oriented tree crop sector. The proposed project extends the
concept of the ongoing IDA assisted Tree Croy Rehabilitation (Tea) I Project
(Cr. 818-CE) to other tea areas of high potertial, whilst diversifying poor
tea areas into more profitable crops. Increases in tea production resulting
from rehabilitation would be offset by diverEification to minimize any effects
on world markets.  This rationalization of te!a production follows the recom-
mendations of Sri Lanka's Tea Master Plan which identified priority areas
for investment in the tea sector. The project was prepared in two stages by
the implementing agencies with the Ministry of Finance and Planning acting
as coordinator. The preparation reports for rehabilitation were completed
in January 1981 and appraised during February 1981 by a mission consisting
o)f Messrs. T.P.N Sinha, J. A. Hayward, G. Mukami, (Ms.) T. Jones (IDA) and
R. Stammers (Consultant). During this appraisal, some of the area proposed
for rehabilitation was found to be more suitable for diversification. An
agreement was reached to prepare a diversification component. The preparation
report for this was presented in June 1981 anid the component was appraised
during September 1981 by a mission consisting of Messrs. J. A. Hayward,
R. Moreno, C. J. Maguire (IDA) and H. W. Mitchell (Consultant).
II. THE TREE CROP SECTOR
2.01      Sri Lanka's tree crop sector consists mainly of tea, rubber and
coconut, which together occupy about 48% of crop land and about 95% of land
under tree crops.  The sector has a dominant role in Sri Lanka's economy.
It continues to be the main source of foreign exchange earnings and in 1980
provided about 58% of export revenue.  The sector also employed about one-
fifth of the labor force and accounted for 21% of the GDP in 1980.  In spite
of its importance, the sector has suffered from continuing neglect.  Produc-
tion of the three main crops grew by only abDut 1% per annum during the 1960s
and stagnated during the 1970s. The disappointing performance was due to
uncertainties associated with GOSL land reforms, declining profitability due
to low prices and high export taxes, and inadequate foreign exchange alloca-
tion for inputs.



-2-
Land Reform
2.02      Sri Lanka's land reform was carried out in two phases.  The first
phase, initiated in 1972, limited private holdings to no more than 20 ha.
At that time, about 225,000 ha of land were vested in the Land Reform Commission
(LRC) of which 60% was under tree crops including 23% under tea. The State
Plantations Corporation (SPC), then under the Ministry of Plantation Industries
(MPI), was given management of about 40 of the larger well-maintained tea and
rubber estates. Cooperatives managed most of the remaining land under the con-
trol of LRC. In the second stage of land reform, initiated October 1975, all
land owned by national and foreign companies, which included the major tea and
rubber estates, was also vested in the LRC. The Government assigned manage-
ment of about 65,000 ha to SPC and nearly 95,000 ha to the Janatha Estates
Development Board (JEDB) which was established for the purpose under the
Ministry of Agriculture and later transferred to MPI.
2.03      Though most of the tree crop plantations were nationalized around
1975, the threat of such nationalization existed for about seven years pre-
viously.  The uncertainties of ownership reduced investments in replanting,
infilling and factory modernization, the effects of which are still evident.
After nationalization, the Government's experiments with different organi-
zational structures added further uncertainty. The experiments with coop-
erative run plantations were particularly disastrous and were abandoned.
Meanwhile the upkeep of estates further deteriorated. Since 1978, the land
tenure and organization structure has been relatively stable and the upkeep
of estates has improved.
The Tea Sub-Sector
2.04      Role in the Economy.  Tea retains a major role in the Sri Lankan
economy and in the tree crop sector, although its dominance recently has
diminished. Value added, including both growing and processing, accounted
for 10% of GDP in 1980, compared to 13.5% in 1977. Tea is still Sri Lanka's
main export although its share in total export revenue fell from 50% in 1977
to 36% in 1980. Even then tea accounted for about 60% of the export revenue
from the tree crop sector. Taxes on tea, particularly the export levy,
provided 17% of the Government-s revenue in 1980. About 18% of Sri Lanka's
labor force is employed in the tea sector.
2.05      Location and Size.  Tea production in Sri Lanka is situated in
the South West wet zone. There are no reliable data on the actual area
under tea cultivation. The official estimate of 244,000 ha is probably too
high because tea land has in recent years either been abandoned or has been
transferred to village development projects. Tea cultivation in Sri Lanka
is classified into three elevational categories: high country (1,200-2,000
m), mid-country (600-1,200 m) and low country (0-600 m).  Their share of the
tea area is about 37%, 38% and 25%, respectively. The high country produces
the renowned flavor teas which established Sri Lanka's tea reputation. The
low country produces the heaviest yields of strong black teas demanded by
Middle East countries. The mid-country produces neither high quality nor



high yields and its lower tea prices are not compensated by greater produc-
tion. GOSL strategy is therefore to invest in tea rehabilitation in the high
and low country whilst diversifying out of tea in the mid-country. The IDA
supported Tree Crops Rehabilitation (Tea) Project (Cr. 818-CE) in the high
country and the Tree Crops Diversification (Tea) Project (Cr. 819-CE) in the
mid-country are assisting in this process. The proposed project combines both
rehabilitation and diversification components and is consistent with GOSL
strategy.
2.06      Structure.  Since the enactment of land reform, 70% of tea land has
been owned by the public sector, primarily by SPC and JEDB.  Smallholders with
less than 4 ha account for 20%, while the remainder comprises private holdings
above 4 ha. Smallholders are predominant in the low grown tea areas in the
South West.
2.07      Tea Production.  Tea planting commenced in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon)
in the 19th century, and after a long period of growth, production reached an
annual average of 223 million kg during 1965-69. Since then production has
declined to an annual average level of 212 million kg in 1975-79. Production
in the mid-country dropped by 20%, from 74 million kg in 1970/71 to 59 million
kg in 1978/79, while high-grown production dropped by 11%, from 83 million kg
to 74 million kg during the same period. However, output in the low country
area increased by 12% in response to market demands, from 58 million kg in
1970/71 to 65 million kg in 1978/79. Total tea production in 1980 dropped to
191 million kg, 7% below the 1979 level, largely as a result of drought during
the early part of the year. Sri Lanka's share. in total world production has
correspondingly declined from 20% in 1960 to E,bout 10% at present. The poor
production performance in the 1970s was due partly to frequent drought,
falling world tea prices, and the uncertainties associated with land reform,
but most importantly to the Government's tax and foreign exchange policies
which discriminated against the tea sector. A,s a result fertilizer use
stagnated, stand maintenance was poor and fie'ld investment activities were
inadequate. For example, the essential replanting program which had averaged
about 2,500 ha a year during the early 1970s J-ell to slightly over 1,000 ha
annually in 1976-78. Replanting has increased recently to about 2,000 ha
annually, although the level is still below the Government's goal of 3,000 ha
per year. In total, only 14% of the country-s tea land has been replanted
with heavier yielding clonal (Annex 1) teas, an important reason for the lack
of sustained improvement in tea yields. Although yields rose from an average
of 1,000 kg per ha in the 1960s to 1,200 kg per ha in 1974-76, the figure
was slightly less than 1,000 kg per ha in 1977-79. At least half of the
tea bushes in Sri Lanka will be over 70 years old by 1985, well beyond their
maximum productive period; most are seedling varieties of uncertain yield and
quality and most fields have high vacancy rat-s. The past neglect of stand
maintenance and replanting will continue to aEfect production adversely over
t'he next decade. The proposed project has a substantial field rehabilitation
program to reverse that trend.
2.08      Tea Processing and Manufacture.  Almost all the green leaf plucked
in the field is processed into black tea before sale and consumption. Pro-
cessing involves initial drying (withering), rolling, oxidation (fermentation),



- 4 -
final drying, grading and packaging. Most Sri Lankan tea is manufactured by
the traditional "orthodox" rolling process which produces high quality loose
black tea demanded by Europe, the Middle-East, Asia and Australia. Sri Lanka
has been hesitant to adopt newer processing techniques (CTC and LTP) which
makes teas more suitable for the tea bags demanded by newer markets in North
America. The industry fears that a move away from "orthodox" manufacture,
where they have considerable experience and skill, would destroy their com-
parative advantage in traditional markets. However, with mid-country tea
markets and prices weakening, Sri Lanka is considering switching some mid-
country tea to the newer type of processing, while retaining orthodox manu-
facture in other areas. The processing and manufacturing is done in about
720 tea factories
2.09      Factory Age, Size and Location.  Most tea factories were constructed
before World War II and contain machinery which is old and inefficient. The
factories are small with average annual made tea production of about 290,000
kg. The small size was appropriate for pre-World War II tea production when
yields were low. With higher yields due to increased clonal tea area and
increased fertilizer use, larger factory capacities are becoming more econo-
mical. 1/ The factories also suffer from a locational problem due to changing
market demands and changing geographic pattern of production. With relatively
decreased appeal and prices for mid-country tea and higher yields and produc-
tion in low country and high country, an imbalance is developing between the
location of tea processing capacity and the location of green leaf production.
Green leaf is bulky and must be processed shortly after harvesting for good
quality tea production. Therefore, more long-range transportation of green
leaf is not a feasible solution to the problem, and new tea processing capa-
city will have to be added in the low and high-country areas. Already about
20% of the mid-country tea factories which were in operation in the early
1970s have had to close and some new factory capacity is being added in other
areas.
2.10      Taxation.  In 1979, tea export taxes accounted for 47% of tea export
value but were reduced by about a third on July 4, 1979, to account for about
35% in 1980. Still, the Sri Lankan tea industry continues to be the most
highly taxed tea industry in the world. The three main taxes on tea in Sri
Lanka are:
- the specific export tax (Rs 8.00/kg).
- the ad valorem tax (35% of the difference between the Net
Factory Average for the month and Rs 22/kg).
- a Tea Board cess (Rs 0.90/kg).
The specific export tax forms about 95% of tea tax revenues. GOSL wishes
to emphasize the role of a specific tax as opposed to an advalorem tax.
The specific tax maintains full incentive for price improvement through more
1/   The new factories being built in East Africa and elsewhere have annual
capacities up to 2M kg.



careful tea picking and manufacture, gives greater incentives for growing tea
in the higher priority areas of low and high country, and discourages tea
growing in the mid-country. However, in periols when local cost inflation
outstrips increases in tea export prices due to sluggish adjustments of the
exchange rate, both the specific and the gross revenue based ad valorem taxes
erode tea margins. Under these circumstances, incentives are squeezed further
which reduces production and exports, as happened in 1978 and 1979. An
alternative, whereby the export duty would be abolished and full reliance
placed on corporate income tax has been discussed with GOSL. However, GOSL
feels that such action must await improvements in financial management and
investment decision making, so that the larger margins are not used on less
essential investments. The proposed project would provide technical assistance
for such improvement. In the meantime, under the ongoing Tea Rehabilitation
Project GOSL is committed to maintaining tea margins at about Rs 2.50-2.75
per kg of made tea, through adjustments of tax, cess, or exchange rates (Cr.
818-CE, DCA Covenant 3.07). However, the adjustment process has been slow
(see also para 2.17).
2.11      Subsidies.  Part of the revenue obtained from tea taxes is returned
to the tea industry through subsidies on fertilizer, and through tea produc-
tion and manufacturing investment subsidies. However, the subsidies are low
and, in 1979, were valued at about 6% of revenue from tea taxes. Their
structure is complex (Annex 2) with about eight different types of subsidies.
They are administered by MPI through the Tea small Holder Development Autho-
rity (TSHDA) and the Tea Board (para 2.16). While GOSL recognizes the com-
plexity of administering a system of taxes and compensatory subsidies, they
feel that without such a system, profits from tea would be spent on less
essential investments. While there may be such tendencies in the two public
corporations, which control 70% of production, a better way to ensure proper
investments is through better management, incentives, financial controls and
decision making. Accordingly, the project provides for technical assistance
to strengthen management, especially financial management, of the public
corporations.
2.12      Tea Industry Institutional Structures.  With the nationalization
of tea estates, the Government has become predominant in the tea industry
and controls the tea industry through five miaistries: the Ministry of
Planning and Finance (MOPF), the Ministry of "land, the Ministry of Plantation
Industries (MPI), the Ministry of State Plantation (SPC), and the Ministry
of Janatha Estates Development (JEDB). MOPF controls the profit margin
of the tea industry through export taxes, coordinates project preparation
through the tree crop sector division of the Planning Department, and approves
the investment program of public sector corporations. The Ministry of Lands
owns the nationalized tea estates through the Land Reform Commission. The
tea estates are operated by the two public sector corporations--SPC and JEDB--
which individually constitute separate ministries. Tea research, extension,
promotion and subsidy administration is handled by MPI. With the involvement
of the five ministries the institutional structure is complex. However, the
structure will be simplified during the project period, as Government intends
to transfer ownership of project estates from LRC to the two public sector
corporations.

2.13      Ministry of Plantation Industries.  The MPI was established in
1970 and given overall responsibility for the major crops in the tree crop
sector. However, the Government felt that the Ministry was too large for
effective management and in February 1980 separated SPC and JEDB from MPI.
The Ministry was left with primary responsibility for tea smallholders and
subsidy administration through TSHDA, tea research, promotion policy and
control through the Tea Board, and training through the National Institute
of Plantation Management (NIPM).
2.14      The TSHDA was established in 1975 but began most of its operations
in early 1978. The Authority was given responsibility for the promotion
and development of the smallholder tea sector, which totals 129,000 small-
holders, each with less than 4 ha, covering approximately 50,000 ha, and
for assisting those tea plantations up to 20 ha without their own factories.
Presently the main activities of the organization are the operation of five
tea factories, the administration of the smallholder price support scheme,
the sale of fertilizer and planting material, the provision of extension
services and the payment of subsidies for field operations.  The TShDA
has also organized green leaf collection centers, and transports some small-
holder leaf to TSHDA factories. The Authority has faced many problems which
have impaired its effectiveness; overall management is weak, particularly in
the areas of finance and planning, there are insufficient staff, and training
is inadequate. As a result extension suffers. The Authority views itself
primarily as a service organization even though it must operate as a commer-
cial organization in running its tea factories. Consequently TSHDA has given
insufficient attention to profitability of its tea factories and has tended
to rely on Government grants. For instance, it has operated Derangala fac-
tory using oil fired furnaces even though, by using firewood which is plenti-
ful, TSHDA could have reduced firing costs by about 90% and total manufac-
turing costs by about 16%. The conversion cost would have been recouped in
less than a year.  The Government wishes to strengthen TSHDA and has started
implementing an Asian Development Bank assisted Third Tea Development Project
which would provide staff, training, and tea processing facilities for
TSHDA in the low country. Consequently, the proposed project would limit
itself to strengthening TSHDA extension services in a small area, bearing
in mind the limited implementation capacity of TSHDA.
2.15      The Tea Board, funded by an industry cess, presently 90 cents/kg,
was established in 1976 for tea promotion and research, collection of statis-
tics and market information and the administration of subsidies in which it
is assisted by TSHDA. The Tea Board also gives advice on tea policy. These
functions are performed through three agencies under the Tea Board--the Tea
Promotion Board, the Tea Commissioner and the Tea Research Institute. The
Tea Promotion Board carries out some marketing activities such as funding tea
centers abroad, but in general most information and advice on market trends
comes to the estates through either the tea brokerage houses or the head
offices of the corporations. The Tea Commissioner's Department administers
subsidies and collects statistics. In 1977 the registration of tea land and
the administration of development subsidies for the tea smallholder sector
were delegated by the Tea Commissioner to the TSHDA. The Tea Research Insti-
tute (TRI) carries out research into all aspects of tea production. The



-7 -
Institute, established in Talawakelle in 1925, has produced detailed recom-
mendations covering all aspects of tea production. These recommendations
can produce tea of the highest standard. Fertilizer application is based on
comprehensive TRI recommendations which relate to crop growth, yield levels
and fertilizer materials. New high yielding clones, suitable for a wide range
of environments and for replanting and infillirg, are continually being tested
and released by TRI. Similarly, methods for ccntrolling pests and diseases,
both with chemicals and through integrated pest management, are being widely
applied. TRI recommendations have been critizEd for lacking economic focus
and evaluation. Accepting this, TRI has embarked on production research to
overcome the shortcoming which may result in minor modification to the recom-
mendations. In the meantime, estate superinterLdents, in consultation with
their Visiting Agents, adapt the recommendations to individual field needs.
The current poor condition of most tea fields reflects recent neglect, not
a lack of good tea technology. In addition to research TRI also has an
active Advisory and Extension Service responsible for training at all levels.
Provision for training in the Tree Crop Sector is the responsibility of the
National Institute of Plantation Management (NLPM).  The Institute works
closely with the Advisory and Extension Service of TRI and during 1980,
organized seminars, courses and field days for all levels of estate staff.
However, the program has been almost exclusively of a technical nature with
ad hoc courses designed solely to improve tea production methods. No atten-
tion has been given to the need for systematic staff development.
2.16      Public Sector Corporations.  The two public sector corporations,
SPC and JEDB, control 60% of tea lands and 70% of tea production. Because
of their size, each with net sales of over Rs one billion, each of the cor-
porations have been given the status of a Minis;try with the President as the
Minister-in-charge. In 1980, the Corporations, which had previously been
highly centralized, were given a regional structure with four boards each,
to improve manageability (Chapter 6). However, decision making is still cen-
tralized which has on occasion caused uncertainty and confusion at regional
level. Reporting procedures are cumbersome and financial management is weak.
High levels of current assets, amounting to 51% and 62% of sales, are main-
tained by the corporations (Table 2.1). Furthermore, performance incentives
for both staff and management are non-existent,. The proposed project
addresses these problems (Chapter 6).

2.17      Tea Margins and Financial Profitability.  The two corporations,
JEDB and SPC, incurred losses on their operations (Table 2.1) because of high
export taxes, weak tea markets and high local inflation. Recognizing the in-
adequacy of tea margins, and in response to an agreement with IDA under CR
818-CE, which requires tea margins to be maintained around Rs 2.50-2.75 per
kg, GOSL reduced the specific export duty in 1979 by about a third to Rs 10.50
per kg. Since then, margins have again suffered due to falling world tea
prices and to doubling of fertilizer prices which has added about one rupee
per kg to the cost of production. GOSL had been informed that restoring the
margin to at least Rs 2.50 per kg through adjustment of export tax, cess or
exchange rate, was a condition of Board presentation. In response, GOSL has
recently reduced export duty by Rs 2.50 per kg to Rs 8.00 per kg, thereby
meeting the condition. Ad-valorem tax has also been revised, but this will
have minor impact on overall margin. Recognizing the importance of tea taxes
as a source of revenue for the Budget, in the longer term, more reliance will
have to be put on reducing tea production costs and increasing productivity
of tea lands. The proposed project aims to reduce production costs through
rehabilitation of tea lands and factories and diversification of poorer tea
areas into other crops. Periodic reviews of margins would, however, be
required to ensure that their level does not deteriorate, and that a reason-
able return on investments is obtained.

2.18      Tea Markets.  World trade in tea is estimated at about 940 M kg and
is expected to grow at about 2.7% per annum, slightly above the historic trend
of about 2.2% during 1961-80. However, Sri Lankan tea exports of about 187
M kg in 1980 have declined from a peak of 224 M kg reached in 1965 for an
average growth rate during 1961-80 of about -0.3% per annum. Consequently,
Sri Lanka's market share has declined from about 35% in the 1960s to about 23%
in 1980. The decline in exports is due to declines in production which also
averaged about -0.3% per annum during 1961-80. The proposed project would
help retard the declining trends in production and exports by rehabilitating
tea lands and factories. The major markets for Sri Lankan tea in 1979 were
the United Kingdom (11%, including production sold at the London auction),
Pakistan (8%) and the United States, Iraq, Egypt and Saudia Arabia (each ac-
counting for about 7%). The major growth market for Sri Lankan tea comprises
Middle East and Persian Gulf countries which ncw account for 50% of Sri Lankan
exports, compared with only 25% in 1975. These markets favour leafy black
tea grown in Sri Lanka-s low country. Consequently, the average price of low
country teas is now higher than that for other regions, whereas it was the
lowest in Sri Lanka before 1970. Most of the proposed project investments
are directed towards rehabilitating low country tea areas and factories.
Over 90% of Sri Lankan tea is marketed through intermediaries who buy at the
Colombo tea auction, now the world's largest. Only about 10% is locally
consumed. The auction is operated largely by six Colombo brokerage houses.
The market is competitive and functions well, although in some market seg-
ments a few major international tea packaging and merchandizing firms dom-
inate. The amount of Sri Lankan tea sold at tihe London auction declined
throughout the 1970s and presently accounts for only about 7% of total tea
exports. The price of Sri Lankan teas at London auction relative to world
averages has declined from a 6% premium in 1969/70 to a 4% disadvantage in
1980. Both buyers and brokers complain about a general deterioration in
tea quality. The proposed project would help ^aise quality through factory
rehabilitation and through improvements in green leaf transport and handling.
2.19      International Tea Prices and Agreements.  Except for a short period
in 1976/77, tea prices (the average of all teas sold at the London auction
measured in 1977 constant dollars) have droppe,l steadily since the 1950s, and
in 1979 the price in real terms was only 45% oE the 1959 price. The price
decline resulted from weak demand and a rapid increase in tea production in
Africa (about 8% per annum). Reflecting concern over prices, the FAO Inter-
Governmental group on tea met in November 1979 and agreed to promote an
international agreement comprising export quotas and buffer stocks. To date,
no agreements have been reached and further meetings are scheduled. Reflect-
ing concern about commodity prices, the existing Bank Group policy, as stated
in the President-s August 17, 1973 memorandum to the Executive Directors
(Document No. R73-206), states that no financing of projects involving tea
production is to be undertaken, except: "(i) financing for increases in
output in countries with no investment alternatives yielding an acceptable
rate of return; and (ii) financing for rehabilitation involving no increase
in output (this implies reduction in acreage and encouragement to diversifi-
cation)." The proposed project qualifies under the second exception.

The Minor Crops Sub Sector
2.20      Sri Lanka's minor export crops, which consist of cocoa, coffee,
cardamom, pepper, cloves, nutmeg, mace, cashew, ginger, citronella, papain
and sesame, are important to the economy. The share of these crops in
official agricultural exports fluctuates considerably from year to year
(from 8.9% in 1974, 5.3% in 1975 and 8% in 1979) due primarily to a lack of
integrated marketing arrangements, speculative behaviour of exporters and
unofficial exports. However, the export of minor crops has proved to be a
significant foreign exchange earner and above all offers the opportunity of
broadening the export base. Sri Lanka is the world's largest exporter of
cinnamon (33% of the market) and exports a significant proportion of cloves
(6.7%), sesame seed (5.9%), cardamom (3.2%) and nutmeg and mace (2.8%).
Exports of the other minor crops constitute less than 1% of the world market.
In contrast to tea, rubber and coconuts the minor crops are mostly grown by
smallholders on homestead plots and have received little formal attention
from Government extension, research and marketing programs. Field data on
areas, yields and production are scarce. Recently, however, in response to
worsening world prices for the major export crops and the country's rapidly
deteriorating foreign reserve position, Sri Lanka has made export crops a high
priority agricultural activity, has established institutions devoted to the
minor crops, and has developed promotional and incentive schemes to imiprove
production and quality. The area under minor export crops 1/ is currently
estimated at 50,000 hectares and Government policy is to increase this to
80,000 hectares by 1990.
2.21      World Market Prospects.  A recent Bank analysis 2/ of market
prospects and rate of returns for the minor export crops recommended that
Sri Lanka should promote increased production of coffee, pepper, cardamom,
and cloves in the mid-country. This analysis confirmed views held in the
country and reinforced Government policies. Recent developments in market
prospects for coffee have resulted in the establishment of an International
Coffee Agreement which defined export quotas for most producers including Sri
Lanka. In recognition of this Agreement the Bank will not finance projects
which would lead to coffee production in excess of established exports limits.
The proposed project therefore is confined to assisting increased production
of pepper, cardamom and cloves on areas presently under tea in the mid-country.
Sri Lanka pepper is admired for its high quality and commands a premium price
on world markets. The share of the market is small (0.6%) so that even large
proportional expansion in pepper exports would have no repercussions on market
prices. Cardamom is a high-value spice and the quality of Sri Lanka's export
is considered good; it could, however, be easily improved further by expanding
better processing facilities. With annual exports of about 175 mt, the market
share is small (about 3%). Sri Lanka's small share of the world's clove
1/   Including cocoa, coffee, cardamom, pepper, cloves, nutmeg, mace, ginger,
citronella and papain.
2/   Sri Lanka: Minor Export Crops - Sector Review, August 1981.

production is of high quality and occupies a salective position in the
market. Therefore, although the general market outlook for cloves is
soimewhat uncertain, Sri Lanka's position within the market appears secure.
2.22      Domestic Marketing Channels.  The existing domestic marketing
system for minor export crops is adequate. The produce from small farmers
passes through several middlemen who then auction it away to exporters.
Larger producers such as JEDB and SPC go directly to brokers for auctioning
their produce to exporters. There are a considerable number of exporters,
both large and small, which ensures adequate competition. These exporters
are generally well informed about daily fluctuations in world markets, and
have adequate communication with potential markets.
2.23      Institutions.  The Department of Minor Export Crops (DMEC) within
the Ministry of Agricultural Development and P.esearch has prime responsibility
for the promotion of minor export crops. It is stationed in Kandy and advises
on all aspects of minor crop production through its extension division, pro-
vides planting material from its nurseries, and administers replanting and new
planting subsidy schemes. A Minor Export Crops Research Station was established
in Matale in 1972. This is maintained by DME( and supported by a UNDP/FAO
program which has provided two minor crop research specialists since 1978.
The research program is in its early stages but is directed towards varietal
selection for disease and pest resistance, uncdercropping of coconuts with
minor crops and maximizing land production through mixed crop models suitable
for small holders and plantations. Work has begun on a substation at Delpitiya
in Kandy district, which was established to support the IDA-assisted Tree
Crops Diversification (Tea) Project (Cr. 819-CE). Impressive crop growth and
early yields are in evidence on trials establiLshed in 1979 on old tea land
typical of the proposed project area. Extension of new technology to small
holders is weak because of staff shortages and lack of extension transport to
ensure good coverage of the widely dispersed :smallholdings. Responsibility
for export promotion of minor crops is held by the Export Development Board,
established in 1979 as the executive arm of the Export Development Council
of Ministries. The Board offers incentives to producers to gear production
to export demand through attention to type and quality standards. It also
operates special export credit schemes and export expansion grants. Recently
the Board has promoted the establishment of producer associations and is
attempting the improve export crop processing and marketing facilities.
IDA Involvement in the Tree Crops Sector
2.24      IDA credits are supporting five projects in Sri Lanka's tree crops
sector. A Tree Crop Rehabilitation (Tea) I Project (CR. 818-CE) is promoting
rehabilitation of high country tea areas whilst a Tree Crops Diversification
(Tea) I Project (Cr. 819-CE) supports the replacement of unprofitable mid-
country tea with a diversity of crops including pepper, cardamom, cloves,
fuelwood and a range of local fruit trees. Two further projects, Kurunegala
Rural Development Project (Cr. 891-CE) and the Second Rural Development
Project (Cr. 1079-CE) in the Matale and Puttalam areas involve extension to
smallholders for minor crop production as part of rural infrastructure devel-
opment. The fifth project, Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation (Cr. 1017-CE)



- 12 -
supports a rubber rehabilitation program in the low country. Management of
all these projects is good and physical achievements on field programs are
close to target. However, Government budgetary restrictions have seriously
constrained the flow of funds to the rural development projects and the
diversification project and all have suffered as a result. In contrast, the
tea rehabilitation project, which is funded directly by JEDB, SPC and Bank
of Ceylon (BOC) has had less problems in this respect. All projects have
suffered from high local cost inflation, and limited construction industry
capacity has necessitated modification of the civil works programs. Proce-
dural problems have slowed disbursement of credit to smallholders but pro-
cedures are being modified to accelerate disbursement. Compliance with
the loan conditions is generally good. The following relevant lessons learned
from previous projects have been incorporated into the proposed project:
a.   Housing:  Even though larger and better ventilated houses were
provided for tea workers in the high country, the workers
complained that precisely these features made their homes
very cold and they preferred their old homes with some minor
improvements. They expressed most interest in improvements
to water supply, roof and ventilation only for kitchen.
Therefore these aspects are stressed in the current project.
b.   Training:  The training programs have been narrowly focussed on
teaching new technology to junior staff and extension workers,
and motivating estate superintendents through overseas visits
to other tea producing countries. Both programs have worked
well and the overseas tours have stimulated new ideas. The
proposed project would add to current procedures by introducing
a graduated staff development program to include management
and financial procedures as well as technical training.
c.   Smallholder credit moved slowly because the commercial banks
did not wish to deal directly with very small borrowers. The
proposed project will use TSHDA as an intermediary. TSHDA
will guarantee credit to smallholders.
d.   Factory power source:  In view of oil price increase and
general shortage of power in Sri Lanka, the proposed project
places more reliance on wood-fired furnaces, micro-hydro units
and fuelwood plantations.
e.   Accounts:  Delays in preparing accounts were experienced.
Partly as a result, technical assistance for financial
management has been provided.

III. PROJECT AREA
General
3.01      The project area (Map 15659R) consists of three geographically
distinct tea growing regions, one in the Nuwara Eliya administrative district
of the high country (Map 15660R), the second in the Kandy, Nawalapitiya and
Matale districts of the mid-country (Map 15910), and the third in the Galle
and Matara districts of the low country (Map 15661R). These regions differ
in elevation, climate, topography, pest and disease incidence, tea manufac-
turing process and social factors, all of which affect agricultural potential,
tea management practices and production. The high and low country areas were
selected for rehabilitation because of their high potential for tea produc-
tion; the Nuwara Eliya district produces good yields of high quality, good
flavor teas, while Galle and Matara districts produce heavy yields of strong
black teas now in great demand in world markets. Teas from both areas fetch
some of the highest prices in Sri Lanka. The mid-country areas were selected
for diversification because they produce poorer low-priced teas with lower
yields and are agriculturally better suited to the production of a range of
minor export crops.
3.02      The high country project area, located about 120 km east of Colombo,
consists of two adjacent plantation groups managed by JEDB. The first, JEDB
Board I (JEDB I), in the Hatton district, consists of 12 estates totalling
4,200 ha; the second, JEDB Board II (JEDB II) in the Agrapatana Valley and
Lindula sub-district, consists of 22 estates t:otalling 7,640 ha. Virtually
all tea in the area is grown on estates; indivridual smallholdings make little
contribution to total production. The low country project area, located in
the southernmost tea area in Sri Lanka, consists of 40 estates managed by SPC
Board IV (SPC IV) with a total tea area of about 6,000 ha and a pilot area
of about 2,500 ha of smallholder tea. The mid-country project area covers
three estate groups; to the north SPC Board I (SPC I) manages 41 estates in
Matale with a total tea area of 10,700 ha, in the central portion JEDB Board
II (JEDB II) manages 19 estates in Kandy with an area of 5700 ha, and in the
southern portion JEDB Board IV (JEDB IV) managnes 14 estates in Nawalapitiya
district with a total tea area of 8538 ha. Thle mid-country diversification
program therefore involves 75 estates with a total area of over 19,000 hectares.
Elevation, Topography and Soils
3.03      The high country estates are located at elevations ranging from
1,200 m to 2,000 m in undulating to deeply dissected terrain where many slopes
exceed 70%. Soil erosion on the upper slopes has exposed bare rock which is
widely scattered throughout the area. Soils are mostly uniform red-yellow
podsols and wet mountains regosols (recently classified as ultisols and
oxisols) which vary greatly in depth depending upon their position in the
catena. They are all acid to very acid with pH around 5. Neither soils nor
topography are well suited to land uses other than tea, forestry or pasture.
3.04      The mid-country estates are located at elevations ranging between
600 m and 1200 m on terrain similar to that of the high country. Most of



- 14 -
the tea is planted on slopes which vary from 20% to 70%. Soil depth varies
greatly depending on the degree of erosion, and rocky outcrops occur in many
areas. The soils are mostly red yellow podsols and redish brown latosols
which are free draining, highly leached, of low base exchange capacity and
with pH between 5 and 6. Topsoils are sandy loams whilst the subsoil contains
a higher clay content. The soils are inherently stable, nevertheless expo-
sure to wind and rain has gradually caused serious erosion in many areas.
The soils are suitable for a wide range of crops provided erosion control
measures are taken and fertilizer and organic matter applied to ensure good
early crop growth. In most areas slopes are too steep for the cultivation
of annual crops but many indigenous perennial crops thrive in the humid
conditions, moderate temperatures and elevations of the mid country.
3.05      Low country estates are situated below about 600 m with most
between 60 m and 150 m. The land is mostly gently undulating with rolling
hills, slowly moving streams and paddy fields in valley bottoms. To the
north east of the area the land rises steeply to over 600 m where topography
and tea estates resemble the mid country. Soils are generally deep and free
draining but exposed rock is abundant on hill crests. The soils are mostly
red-yellow podsols, of pH about 5, and are ideal for tea; though other crops
can also be grown.
Climate
3.06      Mean annual temperatures throughout the project area depend upon
altitude, and range from 21  C in the high country to 27  C in the low coun-
try. Diurnal temperature variation is about 4 - 8 C. Low temperatures are
not limiting and frost, where it occurs on high land, is not severe enough
to damage the tea bushes. The project areas are served by the south-west
monsoon rains from May to August (Yala season) and the high country also
receives the north-east monsoon rains from September to December (Maha season).
Rainfall is less from January to April but prolonged droughts during this
period are uncommon. Total rainfall and seasonal distribution vary consider-
ably over short distances depending upon altitude and aspect. Annual totals
range from under 2000 mm in the mid-country through about 3000 mm in the low
country up to about 5500 mm in the high country. Local storms, driven by high
winds can be severe and cause erosion and damage to exposed crops. Climate
and soils are very suitable for tea production and in the mid-country for the
production of diversification crops proposed under the project.
Socio-Economic Conditions
3.07      The economy of the high country is almost entirely dependent
upon tea. The population is made up largely of Tamils of Indian origin,
who live and work on the tea estates. There are a few traditional villages
sandwiched between the estates but the only substantial urban settlement in
the area is Hatton. The Tamil population is gradually declining because of
the Government's repatriation program and Sinhalese from the mid country are
being encouraged to move to the area. Estate facilities for workers are,
however, poor and immigration is slow. This results in labor shortage at
peak demand periods on some estates. In the low country the economy is not

dominated by tea; rubber, coconuts, paddy and a variety of traditional food
crops are also grown. Numerous small villages are located close to all
estates and village labor supplements estate labor when required, but resident
labor still provides most of the estate work force. The mid-country presents
a transition between these extremes; remote areas resemble the high country
but clusters of villages and some large urban areas around Kandy and Matale
also exist. With the gradual deterioration of mid-country tea estates labor
demand is reduced and many Tamils have moved to labor-short estates in the
high country; a migration actively encouraged by SPC, JEDB and other Govern-
ment agencies.
3.08      The estates have traditionally provided the basic needs of their
labor force, including barrack-style housing for resident labor and simple
medical facilities for all labor. Housing areas are congested and most houses
are old and in poor repair despite the obvious attempts of the occupants to
keep them clean and tidy. Poor housing, particularly in the cold and wet
climate of the high country estates, is a major factor in the sub standard
health of estate labor. Over 700 new twin cottages have been built by Gov-
ernment in the project area to house about 6,ODO people. However, rapid cost
escalation and limited capacity in the construction industry have constrained
the Government housing program and necessitated a revision of estate housing
strategy from new construction to renovation of existing line units. Medical
facilities on most estates are below national standards, and infant mortality
is about 50% above the national average. IDA's first Tea Rehabilitation
project has addressed these problems and UNICEF is assisting in reducing the
mortality rate.
Communications
3.09      A good network of public all-weather roads serves most of the
project area. This is supplemented by an extEnsive network of gravelled roads
on every estate. Villages are well supplied with public transport and Hatton,
Nuwara Eliya, Kandy, Matale, Galle and Matara are served by rail. Telephone
links throughout the estate network are reasonably reliable and regional
offices maintain good inter-communication links.
Fuelwood Availability
3.10      The low-country project area contains rubber plantations which
produce fuelwood at replanting. SPC IV has about 6,200 ha of rubber trees
of which about 200 ha are uprooted every year. In the mid-country, estates
obtain fuelwood for factories, and to supply 'Labor, from rubber estates to
the north and west and from local jungle clea:rings. Fuelwood planting was
seldom undertaken on mid and high country estates in the past but with the
ever increasing scarcity of fuelwood, particuLarly in the high country, a
program of planting Eucalyptus is being vigorously pursued. Fuelwood is
transported from low and mid-country to high country estates but transport-
ation costs are high. Where fuelwood is abundant prices are about Rs 50
per stacked yard but in the high country prices around Rs 118 per yard are
common.

Tea Area
3.11      Project tea area is about 35,000 ha of which 27% is in the high
country, 55 percent in the mid-country and 18 percent in the low country
(Table 3.1). Tea bushes in low country have higher mortality rate due to
termite attack and disease problems, hence average bush life is about 20-25
years compared with at least 50 years in the high country. This has, how-
ever, resulted in the low country being forced to replant more frequently
and clonal tea constitutes a greater proportion of the tea area.

3.12      The condition of the old seedling tea is mostly poor.  During the
last decade, uncertainty of tenure and low profitability reduced investment
in tea maintenance.  The continual replenishment of field stocks through
replanting and infilling programs, an integral part of good tea management,
was depressed and most fields have a high proportion of vacancies (Table 3.2).
This gradual attrition of seedling tea bushes is proceeding more rapidly in
the low country where termite attack is prevalent.

In mid-country estates vacancies vary greatly between estates and between
fields depending upon the maintenance program which itself depends upon
previous yields. On poor estates many fields have been virtually abandoned
and vacancies can be over 80%.
Yields, Production and Prices
3.13      Existing tea yields in the high country and low country project
estates are above the national average of about 1000 kg/ha (Table 3.3).

Poor weeding techniques and inadequate soil conservation result in exposure
of tea bush roots to sunlight which slowly kills the plant. Many OST bushes
now contribute little to production and yielcls are in decline. Average tea
yields on mid-country estates are poor but show a wide variation between
estates. Tea quality throughout the mid country, whether from OST or VP teas,
is poor. Net sales prices in 1980 averaged ERs 18.5 in high country, Rs 19.5
iin low country but only Rs 14.5 in mid-country. However, net sales averages
from project high country and low country esl:ates ranged between Rs 19 and Rs
22 per kg, illustrating that tea quality on project estates in these areas was
good.



- 18 -
3.14      Data on yields and production of minor crops are scarce.  Pepper
yields range between 0.8 kg per vine and 2 kg per vine in the third year.
Clove trees of mixed age between 8 and 12 years at Hunasgiria currently yield
about 0.7 kg per tree but DMEC estimates that with good management yields of
at least 2.5 kg per tree could readily be attained and that mature trees have
a yield potential of about 10 kg per tree. Mature cardamom plantations on mid-
country estates presently give low yields of 10-50 kg/ha of dried capsules.
However, most of these cardamom plantations are over 30 years old, have never
received fertilizer and are poorly maintained. Young cardamom in the mid-
country should produce about 300 kg per ha of dried capsules.
Extension
3.16      Recommendations on all aspects of tea production are passed directly
to tea estate superintendents through TRI seminars held at Talawakelle and
by publications. TSHDA is responsible for smallholder extension but has
been constrained by lack of funds, staff and transport. TSHDA operates 6
fertilizer distribution centers and 46 leaf collecting societies in Galle
and Matara. Twenty-two Extension Officers are responsible for over 33,000
smallholdings spread throughout Galle and Matara but are mainly involved in
administering rehabilitation subsidies. TRI organizes field days for farmers
and refresher courses for TSHDA officials but most smallholders have little or
no contact with extension and have learned their tea growing techniques from
working as laborers on estates. Extension on minor export crops is conducted
by the extension division of DMEC but because of lack of staff and transport
the service to smallholders is weak. Those estates superintendents who grow
minor export crops deal directly with the FAO/UNDP research specialists at the
Matale research station and rapidly adapt research findings to the needs of
their own estates.
Tea Factories
3.17      All 32 factories in the high-country project area manufacture tea
by the orthodox process. Some factories supplement the process with one cut
through rotorvanes.  In the low country, 52 factories (30 SPC and 22 private)
also manufacture tea by the orthodox process but do not use rotorvanes. Most
factory machinery is well over 20 years old and has become inefficient, so
that tea quality has suffered and operating costs have increased. Leaf with-
ering takes place on  tats  (hessian or nylon racks) which adversely affects
tea quality through poor control over the withering process. Fermentation
is conducted on cement floors or on multi-tier cement tables, often cracked
and dirty causing poor aeration, bacterial contamination and loss of quality.
In the high country, 50% of the factories use imported fuel oil for their
driers. Operating cost for these driers is high (Rs 1.42 per kg) compared
with solid fuel driers (Rs 0.55 per kg). Most drying rooms were constructed
to allow discharged hot air to be used for withering tea. This produces poor
working conditions which would be improved by hot air ducting. Factory sorting
machinery is old and inefficient and tends to break tea into small grains
(powder) which reduces the proportion of top tea grades. In the mid-country,
as production has decreased, so many factories have become non-viable and
processing has been discontinued.  Equipment from these  silent  factories



- 19 -
and in some cases the building itself, has been transported to other more
productive areas within SPC or JEDB. Some factories are being used as stores
and others for drying and processing minor crops.
3.18      Power Supply for Tea Factories.  Most tea factories are on the
Government grid system. Uncoordinated power interruptions adversely affected
factory operations and tea quality but unavoidable load shedding operations
are now being announced in advance and coordinated so that factory operations
can be scheduled accordingly.
IV. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Brief Description
4.01      The main objective of the proposed project is to reduce tea pro-
duction costs whilst improving tea quality. This would be achieved by
increasing productivity of existing tea lands in high potential areas of the
low country and high country, by rehabilitatiag factories and improving leaf
transport and by diversifying out of tea into minor export crops and fuelwood
in unprofitable low-yielding tea lands in the mid-country. In addition, the
project aims to strengthen management and financial control of the major tea
producing corporations, to stabilize tea prodacing lands through soil conser-
vation and to improve the welfare of estate workers.
4.02      The main components of the proposed project are:
a.   field program:  continuing replanting and expanding in-
filling programs in high country and low country areas;
renovation of soil conservation works; diversifying non-
viable tea and abandoned tea areas into minor export
crops and fuelwood plantations. Quantities are (ha):

Detailed Features
Field Program
4.03     Tea-Replanting.  The project would assist with the replanting of
272 ha of tea in the high country and 1,490 ha in the low country. Replant-
ing costs in high country areas are far greater than those in the low country
(Rs 77,000 to Rs 90,000 compared with Rs 49,000) because of the associated
need for intensive soil conservation works and control of the root disease
(Poria hypolateritia) in high country areas. The high costs, combined with
the slow return to full tea production, make replanting high country areas
justified only on land with high potential. Replanting would be restricted
to those areas where infilling is not feasible because of high vacancies,
extensive Poria problems or the presence of a high proportion of non-
productive tea bushes, and decisions to replant would be based on historical
yields, soil analysis and topography. Replanting in the low country is more
readily economically viable. Replanting would follow soil fumigation treatment



- 21 -
for root disease where necessary and about 18 months of land rehabilitation
under Guatamala grass (Tripsacum laxum). Replanting techniques are good.
Replanting would replace the smaller-leafed old seedling tea with clonal
material which would be planted on the contour at a spacing of 120 cm x 60 cm,
which is at least 50% above the old seedling tea density. An extensive range
of clones is approved for project areas; most commonly used are the 2,020
series developed by TRI (notably 2,025 and 2,023) but individual estate
selections are also used (DTI, N and K 145). Quality clones, tolerant of
nematodes and Blister Blight are available for the high country, and heavy
yielding, drought tolerant clones (2,026 and 2,045) are recommended for
elevations below 600 m. A promising new generaLtion of clones in the 3,000
series is being released by TRI. The replanting program would cost about
Rs 45 M (US$2.1 M).
4.04     Tea Infilling.  The vacancies in high country and low country tea
fields, which reduce yields, encourage weed growth, and increase erosion
would gradually be filled, firstly by infillinlg larger vacant patches and
later by infilling small spaces as a part of routine field maintenance.
Average vacancies for areas to be infilled are about 16% in JEDB I, 9% in
JEDB II and 12% in SPC IV areas. The infillinl programs of the high and low
country would be 2,096 ha and 1,800 ha, respectively. Infilling would be
carried out in the year of pruning to minimize interplant competition. Patch
infilling would be on the contour at plant spacing of 120 cm x 60 cm and soil
fumigation for Poria control would be conducted where necessary. Infilled
areas would be managed in the same way as the 3urrounding tea and plucking
and husbandry differences would be minimized by using clones such as DN, CY9
and N2 recommended by TRI for infilling. Sufficient planting material for
the replanting and infilling programs would be available from the estate
nurseries.  The infilling program would cost about Rs 19 M (US$0.9 M).
4.05     Diversification.  The establishment of pepper, cardamom, cloves
and fuelwood to replace non-viable mid-country tea would be phased over the
four year period 1982-84. In addition, on abandoned tea lands and land prone
to erosion Leucaena leucocephala (Ipil Ipil) and Eucalyptus grandis (above
700 m) would be planted to supply fuelwood for factories, to provide shelter
belts and to aid soil conservation. Total areas are (ha):

Land selection for diversification would follow the results of a survey
undertaken by FA0/UNDP in 1978 on SPC I estates and of a field-by-field
survey by the JEDB Diversification Manager for JEDB II estates in the Kandy
area. These surveys formed the basis for preparation documents. The area to
be diversified is 26% of the total tea area on the 74 mid country estates, a
figure which coincides with the area of Class C fields (the lowest yielding
third). SPC Class C fields in Matale yield 400-500 kg/ha of made tea and
JEDB Class C fields yield 600-700 kg/ha. Diversification crops would be
planted into existing tea which would continue to be plucked until the new
crop is established (see para 4.06). Cloves are the most demanding of the
diversification crops requiring shade during the early years and shelter from
strong winds. Clove cultivation would be confined to the lower and warmer
areas between 600 m and 800 m on sheltered sites of moderately sloping land.
Pepper is less demanding than cloves, is shallow-rooted and could be grown
over a wider range of conditions. It would be grown on strong support trees
(Gliricidia or Erythrina) planted one year before the pepper vines, at eleva-
tions from 600-1,000 m on moderate slopes of 20-50%. Cardamom would be grown
in the higher areas above 1,000 m on steeper and wetter areas. The crop is
adversely affected by excess light and wind and would be planted under shade
trees established 3 years earlier. Leaf fall from the shade trees would
build up surface mulch. Eucalyptus grows vigorously under the high rainfall
conditions of the high country and mid-country and would be planted on old
tea land too steep for cloves and pepper, and, at higher elevations, on soils
which would not support cardamom. The cost of planting diversification crops
and fuelwood would be about Rs 65 M (US$3.0 M).
4.06     Soil Conservation.  With the general neglect of the tea estates
during the past decade, soil conservation structures, stone terraces, grass
bunds, stone-lined channels and drains have fallen into disrepair and gully
erosion has occurred in many areas. The project would promote the renovation
of terraces using local stone for walling on steep slopes and live terraces
(grassbunding using Eragrostis curvula) on gentler slopes. Many drains are
blocked, are incorrectly aligned and have been used as paths by plucking
labor. Drains would be cleared and realigned (to about 1:120 gradient) to
achieve good water control. In the high country, soil conservation works
would be renovated on 2,900 ha (about 30% of the total cropped area). In
the low country, terraces would be repaired on 2,420 ha (39%) and drains
renovated on 3,600 ha (58%). In the mid country soil conservation would
accompany the diversification program on 2,500 ha. A minimum number of tea
bushes would be uprooted to make space for planting holes; the remaining tea
bushes would provide ground cover until the new crop was fully established at
which time the old remaining tea bushes would be cut back just below ground
level to kill the bush but leave the roots and soil undisturbed. Further
protection of new minor crop plantations would be provided by surrounding
fuelwood belts in the mid country (para 4.05). The cost of the soil conser-
vation program including fuelwood planting in rehabilitation areas would be
about Rs 21 M (US$1.0 M).
Processing and Storage
4.07     Tea Factory Rehabilitation.  Factory rationalization proposed in
the project would rearrange machinery and equipment to ensure efficient flow



- 23 -
of leaf through the manufacturing process. Sonte 62 factories (12 JEDB I,
20 JEDB II and 30 SPC) would be expanded and rehabilitated to improve the
quality of manufacture. Tats would be replacec by withering troughs which
would increase withering capacity by 261,360 kg green leaf per day. Old
driers with an annual capacity of 11.4 M kg made tea would be replaced with
new driers. Additional drying capacity of 10.3 M kg would be provided to
cater for increased production. (Total cost for driers would be Rs 29.7 M
(US$1.4M)). The project would also convert oi]. fired driers to solid
fuel (US$0.2M) to reduce firing cost (from Rs ].42 to Rs 0.55/kg) and to
reduce the demand for oil imports. Initially fIuelwood would be transported
from low and mid-country where it is more plent:iful. Later, fuelwood from
on-estate plantations would supplement outside supplies and further reduce
firing costs. To improve the throughput and quality of top grade teas,
worn-out double-action rollers would be replaced by single-action rollers.
Rotorvanes would be introduced in the rolling process in high-country fac-
tories to increase capacity and enable grade composition to be changed in
response to market conditions. In particular, it would be possible to
increase the proportions of BOPF and Dust I grades required for the tea bag
trade. Handling, sorting, and packing capacity would be improved. A provi-
sion of Rs 3.0 M is made for structural alterat:ions and replacements of
wornout roofing material. A provision of Rs 1.1 M is made to rehabili-
tate small hydropower units in the high country. In addition to factory
investments in JEDB and SPC, the project would replace worn-out machinery
ancl equipment in 22 private factories out of 65 existing in the low country
(Galle and Matara Districts) and at the same time increase the annual capacity
of these factories from 10.8 M kg to 17.8 M kg of made tea. These private
factories process their own leaf plus bought leaf from smallholders. The
requirements of machinery and equipment are similar to those of corporations.
The estimated cost for private factory rehabilitation is Rs 16.7 M (US$0.8 M).
The total cost of factory rehabilitation prograim would be about Rs 159 M
(US$7.6 M).
4.08    Minor Crop Processing and Storage.  High quality green cardamom can
only be obtained by artificial curing under controlled conditions; sun drying
bleaches the capsules which lose value. The project would provide 18 curing
barns to ensure that Sri Lanka.s reputation for good quality cardamom is
maintained as production increases. Processing of pepper and cloves consists
simply of sun-drying.  Nevertheless cleanliness is important and the project
would provide 30 concrete slabs for drying thes~e crops. Minor crops would
be stored in excess space available in mid-counitry tea factories before on-
ward transmission direct to Colombo auctions. (The cost of providing minor
crop processing facilities would be about Rs 1.9 M (US$0.09 M).)
4.09       Field and Nursery Equipment.  Most estates operate tea and fuelwood
nurseries and all mid-country estates produce Epice plants; nursery standards
are high and plant quality is good. To ensure that nursery field operations
and the recommended program of pest and disease control would not be con-
strained by lack of implements and machinery, cultivation tools and sprayers
would be provided. To allow expansion of spice plant production, mid-country
nurseries with an adequate water supply would be proivded with simple sprinkler

systems. To increase green leaf weighing stations to make plucking labor
more efficient, 600 field weighing scales would be provided. Power and hand
winches would be made available for uprooting operations. These items would
cost an estimated Rs 13 M (US$0.6 M).
4.10      Green Leaf Transport.  To improve plucking efficiency and to ensure
that green leaf arrives at factories regularly and in good condition 105
tractors (45 HP) and 210 trailers would be provided to high country and low
country estates. For longer hauls to the edges of larger estates 73, 3-ton
trucks would be provided (larger capacity trucks are not practicable on
estate side roads). The trucks would also be used for fertilizer, machinery
and labor distribution. Trucks and trailers would be fitted with racks to
separate leaf sacks and permit maximum ventilation during transport. Six
18,000 liter fuel bowsers would be provided to transport fuel from railheads
to estates. (Estimated cost of providing transport for green leaf is Rs 33
M (US$1.6 M).)
4.11       Housing.  About 250,000 people are housed on the project tea
estates, mostly in barrack type lines.  Most blocks are in poor condition
with leaking roofs, blocked drains and inadequate water supplies.  GOSL is
aware of the extremely poor housing facilities provided for estate labor but
is equally aware that for financial and logistic reason the problem cannot
be rapidly solved.  Therefore the project would improve housing conditions
for 37,500 people (15%). The project would renovate 7,900 line rooms by
providing re-roofing, drain construction and individual water supplies.
These line rooms would be enlarged where feasible by making two units into
one in a program phased with the construction of new twin cottages. The
project would construct 390 twin cottages (63 sq. m floor area), each to
house 2 families with separate kitchen, latrine and bathing facilities.
Satisfactory designs have been produced under the IDA supported Tea Rehabili-
tation I Project and these would be used for the proposed project. (The cost
of the housing program is estimated at Rs 44 M (US$2.1 M).)
4.12      Medical Services.  Estate labor productivity is greatly reduced
by poor health (mostly respiratory disease, anaemia and parasite problems).
Health of the estate population is much below national standards largely
because of poor housing conditions which would be improved under the project
(para 4.12). In addition medical facilities on individual estates would be
improved by: renovating and upgrading 84 project dispensaries; providing 7
new dispensaries in SPC IV estates; providing 30 ambulances to carry labor to
the nearest hospital; providing motorcycles for estate dispensary staff to
visit the lines to treat bedridden patients, attend childbirth and provide
maternity aftercare. The project would also provide a stock of basic drugs
and supplies to dispensaries. The estimated cost of the medical component is
Rs 11.6 M (US$0.6M). Technical assistance consultants would assist with the
development of detailed specifications for the health component (para 4.15).
4.13     Staff Development and Training.  The project would establish a
staff development and training coordinating capability within NIPM to address
the keenly felt need on the part of SPC and JEDB Boards and estate managers
for improved skills in management and technical fields related to the



- 25 -
industry. The NIPM, presently operating from temporary quarters in the
Ministry of Plantation Industries, Colombo, would be relocated to renovated
premises close to Kandy. It would engage two Sri Lankan training specialists
and would retain the services of an internationally recruited Staff Develop-
ment Consultant to assist with the establishment and initial operation of the
program which would draw upon the expertise of resource persons from the TRI,
Minor Crops Research Institute, Sri Lanka Industrial Development Association,
the Ministry of Agricultural Development and Research and the University at
Peradeniya in planning and presenting its training sessions. The staff
development and training program would assist SPC, JEDB and the TSHDA to
organize and conduct a regular series of in-country training activities for
estate staff and would coordinate a limited number of carefully planned study
tours for selected Board and estate management-level personnel. The project
would also provide funds to enable TRI to purchase audio-visual equipment for
its program of training for SPC and JEDB. The NIPM training specialists
would assist SPC and JEDB to establish their own in-service training units
and would introduce a systematic rather than an ad hoc program of training,
flexible enough to react to changes in the industry and wide enough eventually
to provide assistance to the plantation sector on a nationwide basis. The
cost of the staff development and training program would be about Rs 16 M
(US$0.8 M).
4.14     Technical Assistance.  The two corporations, JEDB and SPC, are
relatively new, and management and financial procedures are still being
established. Precise data collection and records are maintained at all
estates but data assimilation and analysis for management purposes is not
undertaken. The project would provide 34 man nmonths of local expertise and
16 man months of international assistance to inmprove market promotion by
the Tea Board and management procedures within the Corporations. The con-
sultants would review incentive schemes and establish data retrieval and
analysis procedures. The project housing program (para 4.12) is complex,
involves the phased renovation of occupied old buildings and the efficient
use of local materials in a new building program. Technical assistance to
coordinate and supervise the housing and water supply programs and to design
and supervise the building program would be provided by the project. Detailed
proposals for the health component of the project have still to be worked out.
The project would appoint local qualified medical consultants to review
existing facilities and to integrate a project program with Ministry of Health
and other welfare programs in project areas. "he distribution of private
estates and factories between Corporations has resulted in an imbalance in
the supply of green leaf to factories and factory capacity. The rearrangement
of capacity and the rationalization of leaf supply would require assistance
from a factory consultant. The project would provide eight man months for a
factory rationalization study. The Technical Assistance program would involve
a total of 87 man months of locally recruited consultants (Rs 10,000/mm) and
16 man months of internationally recruited consultants (Rs 200,000/mm). The
total cost of technical assistance would be about Rs 4.6 M (US$0.22 M).
4.15     Tea Smallholder Assistance.  Extensioa support for smallholders
throughout the project area is weak (para 3.16). The project would mount
a pilot smallholder support component in 3 eleztorates of the low country
(Weligama, Hakmana and Akuressa) where 2,300 ha of tea are grown by 3,197



- 26 -
registered smallholders. Clonal planting material would be provided on
credit, recovery being made by TSHDA from the Government replanting subsidy.
The project would recruit 21 additional extension officers to operate from
villages in the low country. They would be administered by three Senior
Extension Officers and one Regional Extension Officer based at the Galle
office of TSHDA. Extension officers would be trained through the NIPM staff
development and training program (para 4.14). The program would cost about
Rs 1.5 M (US$0.07 M).
4.16     Administrative Support.  The project would provide basic office
equipment for all estate offices and for the Regional Board offices. A mini
computer facility would be sited at Regional Offices in Hatton, Kandy and
Galle for data summary and analysis. Much of the estate personnel transport
is old and inefficient and junior field staff have little transportation for
supervision of labor. The project would provide 31, 4-wheel drive vehicles
for work in high country and mid-country estates and 146 motor cycles for use
by junior assistants. To ensure efficient supervision throughout the scat-
tered estates of the mid-country and low country a total of 50 small cars
would be provided. A mini bus would be provided to ease transportation
problems in the Galle office of SPC IV. Two 3-ton trucks would be provided
for SPC I in Matale to facilitate collection of spice produce from estates to
the central storage facility. As the Tea Smallholder Development Authority
is weak and is currently being reorganized, the project would provide the
additional extension and financial staff to enable TSHDA to fulfill its
important smallholder support role. The TSHDA Head Office in Colombo would
be strengthened with a financial manager and two accountants and the Regional
Office in Galle would be strengthened with senior extension staff and ac-
countants to supervise the district extension staff and the subsidy and credit
programs. A 4-wheel drive vehicle, 3 motor cycles and 22 bicycles would be
provided for project extension staff. The total base cost of administrative
support for the Boards and TSHDA would be about Rs 17.6 M (US$0.84 M). Sup-
port vehicles for the Diversification Program would cost a further Rs 6.7 M
(US$0.3 M).
4.17     Project Preparation.  SPC and JEDB are to establish a task force to
undertake a field-by-field classification of estates which would enable a
rationalized medium-term investment program to be drawn up for future project
preparation. This project would provide Rs 1 M (US$0.05 M) to fund local
travel and incidental expenses for the task force operations.
V. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
5.01      The estimated total cost of the 4-year project, including contin-
gencies, is Rs 695 M (US$33.1 M equivalent), of which about US$10.9 M (33%)
would be foreign exchange. Taxes and duties would amount to approximately
Rs 40 M (5.8%). Details of project costs, summarized below, are in Annex 2.

5.02      Cost estimates are based on findings during appraisal and updated
to June 1981. Physical contingencies are 5% for field, equipment and vehi-
cles; and 10% for factory civil works, housing and medical, reflecting site-
specific design variations. Price contingencies, accounting for 29% of total
costs, include an allowance for 6-month slippage in project implementation
for unforeseen delays (5% of total costs) and have been compounded at the
following levels:

Financing
5.03      The proposed IDA credit of $20.0 M would finance 64% of the total
project cost, net of duties and taxes; including 100% of foreign costs and 45%
of net local costs.

5.04      Following existing procedures, the Government would on-lend about
US$17.5 M of the IDA credit to JEDB (about US$8.5 M) and SPC (about US$9 M) at
commercial interest rates for agricultural credit, currently 16% per annum.
The interest rate would be reviewed every year and with IDA agreement adjusted,
if necessary, to reflect market conditions. The term of sub-loans to JEDB and
SPC would be for 15 years with five years grace period. The interest rate of
16% represents a positive rate when compared with the expected average infla-
tion rate of 10% over the term of the loan. The interest rate is the standard
rate for tea producers and manufacturers and would not give any competitive
advantage to the implementing agencies. Private factories and small-holders
would receive loans of about US$1 M, through the Bank of Ceylon (BOC), also at
16% for 15 years. The Bank of Ceylon would receive these funds from the
government at an interest rate of 13%, allowing a 3% spread. Signing of a
subsidiary loan agreement between GOSL, JEDB, SPC and BOC, satisfactory to IDA,
is a condition of credit effectiveness. The NIPM and the extension wing of
TSHDA are non-revenue earning entities under the Ministry of Plantation Indus-
tries (MPI). Therefore, they would be provided with funds through budgetary
allocation to MPI.



- 29 -
Procurement
5.05      Most project procurement would be carried out by the regional
boards of the two corporations (para 6.06). All factory equipment, tractors
andc vehicles ($9.1 M) would be procured following ICB, in accordance with
IDA procurement guidelines. Bids from domestic: manufacturers would receive
a margin of preference of 15% or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is
lower. Non-factory equipment, bowsers and trailers ($0.8 M) would be pur-
chased in small lots, not suitable for ICB, and would, therefore be procured
after competitive bidding advertised locally, i-ollowing procedures acceptable
to IDA. Civil works construction would be scat:tered and would consist mainly
of small housing construction and renovation. This would not interest foreign
bidders. Contracts for building of new cottages, processing and storage
facilities and for construction materials ($2.0 M) would, therefore, be
awarded after competitive bidding, advertised 'Locally. Following existing
practices, field rehabilitation and diversification work ($7.5 M including
fertilizer subsidy) and housing renovation ($0.3 M) would be undertaken by
the estate labor on force account. Consultants for technical assistance
($0.2 M) would be hired following Bank guidelines. Training ($0.8 M),
medical ($0.6 M), incremental staff costs and administrative support ($0.8 M),
and followup project preparation ($0.05 M) represent the balance of project
costs (excluding contingencies).
5.06      Contract Review:  About 450 bidding packages/contracts are expected
for procurement of goods and civil works. Aboat 85% of these will be for
small items of factory and field equipment and for civil works, and each will
be well below $100,000 because of the dispersed nature of construction involv-
ing about 150 tea estates. About 40 contracts will exceed $100,000 mostly
for factory machinery and transport. Most of the procurement will be handled
by the two corporations, SPC and JEDB, who have implemented the Tree Crops
Rehabilitation (Tea) I Project (Cr 818-CE) and are familiar with Bank proce-
dures. Therefore, there is little risk of mis-procurement and a threshold of
$100,000 is recommended for prior review of IDA of specifications and draft
tender documents. This threshold level would result in review by IDA of about
9% of bidding packages covering 35% of the value of all contracts. The remain-
ing documents will be kept by SPC and JEDB for IDA inspection during project
supervision.
Disbursements
5.07      Disbursements under the proposed credit (Annex 2, T25-26) would
be completed by September 30, 1986--approximately one year after project
completion. The five year disbursement periocL compares with about 8.0 years
disbursement period for typical agro-industries in the South Asia region.
The period is reasonable considering that factory equipment forms the major
part of the project investment and will be procured early because most of it
wiLll be placed in existing factory building, obviating civil works construc-
tion. Disbursements would be made for:



- 30 -
a.   100% of foreign expenditure on directly imported
vehicles and equipment or 100% of ex-factory cost
if locally manufactured or 85% of expenditures for
imported goods procured locally ($15.3 M);
b.   100% of expenditure on training, technical assistance
and project preparation ($1.7 M); and
c.   85% of expenditure on new labor housing, factory civil
work, construction of processing storage facilities,
and construction material for renovation ($3.0 M).
5.08      Credit withdrawal applications would be fully documented.  Project
implementation has already started. Retroactive financing up to $0.5 M is
recommended for eligible project expenditures incurred after January 1, 1982,
so that project implementation is not slowed down.
Accounts and Audits
5.09      Separate project accounts would be maintained by the implementing
agencies, in a format similar to that agreed upon in TCR I Project. Account-
ing and internal audit functions are weak and would be strengthened through
technical assistance to be provided under the proposed project. The imple-
menting agencies have been slow in preparing financial statements, but the
performance is improving. GOSL gave an assurance that the agencies would sub-
mit their financial statements including Balance Sheet, Income Statement,
Sources and Applications of Funds Statement, and project accounts, for audit
and to IDA within four months of fiscal year end.
5.10      All implementing agencies are Government owned and audit of their
financial statements is done by the Auditor-General (AG). AG engages private
auditors to help with the audit as necessary. GOSL gave an assurance that
audit of all project accounts, and of JEDB, SPC, BOC and TSHDA financial
statements would be completed within eight months of fiscal year end and
audited statements made available to IDA immediately thereafter.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
6.01      The proposed project would be implemented mainly by the two Govern-
ment owned corporations--JEDB and SPC (para 2.06). Three of the four regional
boards within JEDB (Boards I, II and IV) would implement the proposed project
in the high and mid-country (42% of total project investments); while two of
the four SPC regional boards--Boards I and IV--would implement the proposed
project in the low country (50% of total investments). Smallholders would be
responsible for the remaining investments (8%).
Organization and Management - JEDB and SPC
6.02      Both corporations would continue to operate within the general
framework of the existing decentralized organizational structure, brought



- 31 -
about by the reorganization of the two corporations in 1980. Under this
structure the regional boards would continue to be headed by separate chair-
men, each assisted by the following:
a.   sub-regional directors supervising groups of estates,
with each estate headed by an EstatE. Superintendent, and
b.   a Board Office Manager supervising accounting, personnel
and other support staff at board hee.dquarters.
6.03      Because the Boards were recently created, some organizational
problems exist.  During project implementation the following structural
changes would be necessary to facilitate project implementation.
a.   Span of Control.  The current span of control, whereby
the Board Chairman supervises three Directors and an
Office Manager, while the Directors, in turn, supervise
15 to 50 Estate Superintendents, is clearly imbalanced
and results in poor supervision. GOSL gave an assurance
that the supervision system would be rationalized. This
could be done by i) merging small estates into contiguous
larger ones, ii) by combining small estates into groups,
and iii) by increasing the number o- Directors on the
larger Boards.
b.   Board Office Structure.  Currently a Manager supervises
all support functions at Board Office level including
financial, personnel, legal, develo?mental, and supply
matters.  During implementation the financial function
would be strengthened and the Finan2e Director would
report directly to the Chairman.
6.04      An important objective of the 1980 reorganization was to decentra-
lize management of the two corporations. While the formal organizational
structure was decentralized, in practice management style remains centrally
oriented. Some changes are essential for efficient management, but for
effective implementation it is important that changes are not imposed from
outside; details must be worked out in full consultation with affected staff.
Management consultants recruited under technical assistance would discuss
proposals for change with the corporations during 1982 and then assist
in implementing the new structure during the following three years. The
consultants would produce a management manual which would help establish
operating procedures for decentralization. During implementation the con-
sultants would train managers with the help of the manual. To help with
effective decentralization of management, without loss of control over
corporate performance, management accounting and internal audit procedures
would be strengthened and tied to an effective incentive system. For that
purpose the team of management consultants would include financial management
specialists. It is a condition of effectiveness that management consultants
will be hired under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. GOSL gave an
assurance that the organization and managemert proposals agreed between GOSL



- 32 -
and the consultants, in particular those relating to incentive schemes and a
management information system would be discussed with IDA by August 31, 1983
and implementation would start by December 1, 1983.
Project Implementation and Coordination
6.05      The project is planned to be implemented over four years ending
December, 1984 (Annex 5). Allowing time for unforeseen delays, the project
should be completed by September 1985 and disbursements by September 1986.
The project would be implemented by five individual Boards and MPI who
have each designated an existing Director/Regional Manager or Chairman
as Project Director. The Office Managers under the direction of Project
Directors and assisted by Field and Factory Advisers, and accounting staff
would be responsible for timely project procurement and for ensuring that
disbursement requests are made. A Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) has
been set up with Secretary, Ministry of Janatha Estates Development as the
Chairman. The PCC would coordinate and monitor the progress of the project
and remove bottlenecks in implementation. JEDB I & II and SPC IV are pre-
paring tender documents. Field rehabilitation work has started. JEDB and
SPC central offices would coordinate project implementation by their respec-
tive Boards.
Project Monitoring and Reporting
6.06      The office managers under each Director/Regional Manager are
already responsible for monitoring and reporting. They will continue the
responsibility under the project, using formats established for the ongoing
rehabilitation project. The reports would be collated by the central offices
of each corporation.
VII. YIELDS, PRODUCTION AND MARKETS
Yields
7.01      Yields of OST in the high country have averaged about 1,100 kg/ha
in JEDB I areas and 1,300 kg per ha in JEDB II areas for the past 5 years
but are declining steadily (para 3.13). Clonal yields are much higher; over
half the high-country estates have produced VP yields exceeding 2,300 kg per
ha consistently since 1976 and yields in excess of 3,500 kg per ha are com-
mon. Yields are generally higher in Nuwara Eliya (JEDB II) than in Hatton
(JEDB I) areas because of consistent good management in the past which has
resulted in a more complete stand density. In the low country higher tem-
peratures induce more rapid vegetative growth and VP yields over 5500 kg per
ha have been obtained by estates and smallholders. 1/
I/   These yields compare with average yields from all teas of about
1850/kg/ha in India and 1750 kg/ha in Kenya.



- 33 -
7.02      Without the project, yields in the highl country are expected to
decrease by 2% per year between 1981 and 1985. The rate of yield reduction
would accelerate without soil conservation ani infilling, reaching an esti-
mated 8% per year after 15 years (Annex 5).  In the low-country yield decline
from inadequate soil conservation would be slower (about 0.5% per year) but
plant deaths from more rapid aging and termite attack would be greater (3%
OST and 5% VP-Annex 5).
7.03      With-project yields of VP tea are cDnservatively estimated to
average 2,200 kg per ha in JEDB I areas and 2,300 kg per ha in JEDB II areas.
These yields are assumed to remain constant as routine infilling at pruning
would make up any bush losses and the aging process is slow. In the low-
country mean VP yield potential would be 2,80D kg per ha but actual yields
would be reduced by bush aging and deaths to about 2,550 kg per ha on estates
and about 2,700 kg/ha on more individually managed private grower plots.
Due to increased VP plantings, the project would increase the average tea
yield in the project area by about 17% by 1990. Without project the average
yield would have declined by 22% over the ten year period (Table 7.1).

7.04      Yields of improved pepper varieties have reached 2 kg per vine
(about 3,300 kg/ha) in Matale, and DlEC anticipates mature crop yields of
tup to 3 kg per vine. However, as soil conditions and mnanagement supervi-
sion would not be ideal on all estates, average yields are conservatively
projected to reach 0.9 kg per vine (1,500 kg per ha) at full production,
about 8 years after planting.
7.05      It is estimated that clove trees established from two-year old
seedlings would come into production in the sixth year from planting out
and that yields would gradually build up from 50 kg per ha to 500 kg per
ha in the fifteenth year. This mature yield is equivalent to 1.85 kg per
tree which is realistic for estate yields whan compared with current small-
holder yields of about 1.5 kg per tree and potential yields in the project
area of about 10 kg per tree.
7.06      Average cardamom yields on private smallholdings in the project
area are about 100 kg per ha. Young cardamom at Delpitiya research station
in the project area has produced about 300 kg per ha. Project production
on estates is estimated at 150 kg per ha at maturity, gradually declining to
80 kg per ha after 19 years.

7.07      Eucalyptus grandis and Leucaena leucocephala (below 700 m) grow
extremely vigorously in the wet conditions of SW Sri Lanka. A mean annual
increment of 60 cu yards per hectare of stacked fuelwood (including all small
branches used in factory driers and by estate labor) equivalent to 30 cu m
solid timber, should readily be obtained on an 8-year coppice cycle. With 8
ft by 8 ft spacing and 80 percent establishment this yield is equivalent to
0.36 cu yards per tree after 8 years which is considered conservative under
Sri Lankan conditions.
7.08      Production and Markets.  Increases in tea yields would not increase
national tea production. All production increases in the high country and
low country tea areas would be offset by diversification out of tea in the
mid-country. Spices and fuelwood production in the mid-country would increase
substantially. At full development the project area would annually produce
an additional 1,607 tons of black pepper, 175 tons of dried cloves, 141 tons
of dried cardamom and 348,000 cu yards of fuelwood. All fuelwood will be
used within the country, about half within the tea industry to fire driers
the remainder to supply the increasing demands of the local fuelwood market.
All spices would be exported; the quantities produced are small by international
standards and would have no measurable impact on world prices (para 2.22).
7.09      Prices.  No incremental tea production would result from the project.
Therefore world market prices for tea will not be affected by the project,
nor will they have any substantial impact on project viability. The incre-
mental project output of minor export crops will be small in relation to world
markets. Since most markets analyses for these crops (pepper, cloves and
cardamom) agree that world markets will generally remain stable, the prices
used for these crops are based on the average real price for the latest three
years. All fuelwood produced under the project would be for local consumption.
The shorter supply in the high country areas and the consequent additional
cost of transport from the mid-country results in higher prices in the high
country areas relative to the mid-country. All high country fuelwood produced
by the project would be consumed by the project tea factories to dry tea.
Therefore, high country fuelwood prices will not be affected by the project
output. The table below summarizes the prices used in the analysis, details
of which are presented in Annex 6.

VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
8.01      GOSL would be the main project beneficiary through the two
corporations--JEDB and SPC. The two corporations make important contributions
to the government-s development budget through taxes and duties on tea exports.
However, decline in the financial viability oi- the corporations has forced
GOSL to reduce such taxes. The project would improve the efficiency of the
corporations and thereby restore their financial viability thus helping to
maintain GOSL revenues.
Financial Benefits and Operating Cost
8.02      Project benefits are not projected to arise from increased national
tea production. Increases in project revenues from tea would be small, about
Rs 37 M per year by 1990, due to improvements in quality which would improve
price by 5% in the high country and 3% in the low country. Financial benefits
from spices and fuelwood would be larger, aboit Rs 81 M per annum.

8.03      The main financial benefits would come from reductions in tea
operating costs of about Rs 131 M per year which even when offset by operat-
ing cost increases due to spice and firewood operations, would still produce
Rs 109 M in annual savings. Current low tea yields make Sri Lanka tea labor
very inefficient; labor is deployed over an extensive tea area for cultivation
and plucking. By concentrating current level of tea production over a smaller
area tea labor productivity would be increased and Rs 92 M per year would be
saved. This would be partly offset by Rs 14 M increase in labor cost due to
cultivation of spices and fuelwood on lands diversified out of tea. Use of
fertilizer and chemicals would also become more efficient, saving another
Rs 29 M per year. Introducing more efficient factory machinery would save
fuel and power which, combined with conversion of driers from oil to wood,
would save about Rs 14 M per year.
Financial Rate of Return
8.04      Project financial rate of return would be about 21% which would
give adequate incentive for project implementation (Table 8.2).

The financial rate of return to infilling is high because of subsidy (about
80%) for such investments and also because of savings in weeding costs due to
denser coverage of the land by tea bushes. Returns from replanting are less
at-tractive because of high investment costs and proportionately low subsidy
(about 40%) on investment costs. Returns fronm private sector factory invest-
ments were low because a GOSL regulation which allows factories to retain only
25% of any price improvement they produce by improving their processing through
factory rehabilitation. In response to IDA recommendation, GOSL has recently
increased the retention ratio for private tea factory owners from 25% to 40%.
Returns from public sector factory investments occupy the higher part of the
range shown above. The financial rate of return to diversification is at an
attractive level of 24%. Financial returns from tea rehabilitation are lower
due to tea export taxes.
Sources and Applications of Funds
8.05      The project area would generate suff'icient funds to enable corpora-
tions to finance about 25% of the proposed investments (Table 8.3) and to
retain about Rs 310 M in surplus funds.

The project area tea lands are amongst the best in Sri Lanka.  Even though
they form less than about 20% of tea lands of the two corporations, they
produce about 40% of financial surplus. The corporations were obliged to
operate some low yielding tea lands in the mid-country, which were run at
financial losses. The project, by helping to diversify some of these areas
out of tea, would reduce financial losses and would increase the surplus.
Financial Profitability
8.06      Although the project area tea estates are highly profitable, the
low yielding mid-country tea estates depress corporate profitability which
is in part the motivation behind the mid-country diversification component.
Consequently the corporations incurred financial losses in the past. The
project would increase financial profitability by diversifying low yielding
mid-country tea lands and concentrating tea production in a smaller area in
the low and high country. To ensure that high export taxes and increases
in GOSL managed prices do not erode incentives for tea production, GOSL has
also given assurances that it will take all measures necessary to ensure
that tea producers realize satisfactory returns. To that end GOSL also
gave assurances that the projected and actual tea profit levels would be
reviewed annually with the Association by each May 31, and GOSL will agree
on a plan of action to ensure reasonable financial returns to tea producers.
Financial Structure
8.07      Because of past losses the financial structure of the two corpora-
tions is inadequate. The Current Ratio ranges between 1.0 and 1.1 and the
proportion of debt to equity is above 75 to 25. Until recently most of the
assets operated by the corporations were not owned by them. During February/
March 1982, GOSL transferred 246 estates to the corporation.  Transfer of



- 39 -
remaining project estates to the two corporaticns as GOSL equity is a Condi-
tion of Effectiveness. In addition an assurance was obtained that GOSL would
ensure that the two corporations maintain:
a.   Current Ratio above 1.3; and
b.   proportion of long term debt to equity below 70 to 30.
Financial and Fiscal Impact of the Project
8.08      By 1990, the incremental financial benefits of Rs 228 M per year
from the project would allow the net income of the corporations to increase
from almost zero, without the project, to about: 6% of sales with project.
Without the project, the corporations, cash surplus after interest payments
would have been only Rs 75 M; just sufficient t:o finance about 12% of
investment required for normal replacement of capital. The project would
generate sufficient additional cash surplus by 1990 (Rs 172 M) for the
corporations to finance from internally general:ed funds about 43% of the
investment required for normal replacement, thereby reducing the reliance
of the corporations on support from GOSL or on reductions in export duty.
The incremental financial benefit of Rs 172 M per annum, after debt service
in 1990, would pass on to GOSL since GOSL is the only shareholder of the
corporations. This compares with GOSL contribution of about Rs 76 M over
five years.
IX. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
General
9.01      The project forms part of the Government's development strategy
to arrest the decline in export earnings and bludget revenues from tea, a
principal source of such revenues and to diversify uneconomic mid-country tea
areas into cultivation of spices and fuelwood. The project would not increase
Sri Lanka-s tea production. The principal project benefits would come from
reduced tea production cost, tea quality improvement and spice and fuelwood
production increases.
Economic Benefits
9.02      Currently tea yields are low and declining.  Consequently, Sri
Lanka has to use a disproportionately large land area to produce tea to earn
foreign exchange. Also unit cost of production of tea is inversely related to
yields. Therefore, the declining yields are putting pressure on tea margins
forcing the Government to reduce export duties and to forego a significant
source of funds for its development budget. The project would concentrate tea
production on areas best suited for tea and thereby reduce production costs by
Rs 119 M annually. The project would also improve the quality of tea exported
and would bring an additional Rs 62 M from improved prices of those teas.
Spice and fuelwood production increases would produce incremental benefits of
Rs 85 M and costs of Rs 20 for a net incremental benefit of Rs 65 M.

Non-Quantified Benefits
9.03      The project would improve the health and welfare of estate labor
by improving labor housing, water supply, sanitation and medical facilities.
Through the training and technical assistance components, the project would
improve corporate management and control, which would also benefit tea
areas outside the project.
Economic Analysis
9.04      The project economic rate of return (ERR) would be about 29% (Annex
6), with marginal component-average ERR ranging between 15 and 75 (Table 9.2).
The benefit/cost analysis is made in border Rupees, with international prices
converted to Rupees at the exchange rate of US$1 = Rs 21. Local prices have
been converted to border Rupees by means of appropriate conversion factors
(Annex 6). A general conversion factor of 0.8 has been used for labor costs.

9.05      Because of wide agro-ecological and social variations in the project
area, marginal returns for components have also been calculated for four
different segments of the project area. The ERR for most components is good,
as can be expected from a rehabilitation oriented project. The main problem
is with the returns from the replanting component. Though the average ERR
from replanting at 15% is adequate, the range of returns shows that for some
portions of the project area the ERR may be inadequate. At appraisal, agree-
ment was reached to reduce replanting investments in such areas, which are
in the high country. High country replanting costs are now just 4% of the
project cost. The replanting would be done mainly in disease (Poria) infected
areas where there is a danger of disease spread to other areas. GOSL gave an
assurance that a field by field evaluation of current and potential yields be
done for each field proposed to be replanted in high country project area and
only those fields would be replanted for which NPV at 12% is positive and
higher than for alternatives.
Sensitivity Analysis
9.06      Switching values at an opportunity ccst of capital of 12% have been
estimated for incremental benefits and costs (Table 9.3).
Table 9.3 -- Switching ValueE (OCC=12%)

They show that project economic rate of return is relatively insensitive to
changes in costs and benefits. Individually, even if revenue increases due to
spice production and tea quality improvements do not materialize or operating
cost savings due to more concentrated tea produiction is not realized, the
project would still be viable. Similarly, project costs can double without
affecting project viability.



- 42 -
9.07      Switching values of project components show that tea replanting
and fuelwood components have the greatest sensitivity because of their
relatively lower rates of return. For replanting, the yield-dependent cost
savings can decrease by 39% without affecting viability. The savings, which
result from replacing old seedling tea by higher yielding clonal tea, are
based on field experience with such replanting in Sri Lanka over the last
15 years. The savings estimates are therefore very reliable. For fuelwood,
the maximum sensitivity is with respect to revenues from fuelwood. Consi-
dering the general shortage of energy and the large requirements for drying
tea in the project area, the fuelwood prices are unlikely to decline. Fuel-
wood yields are also unlikely to be lower by 39%, since these yields are
conservative estimates based on yields already achieved under field condi-
tions in the mid and high country of Sri Lanka.
Project Risks
9.08      The technical risks of the project with respect to tea production
are low because of the long experience which the corporations have in tea
cultivation and processing. As the Corporations have less experience with
minor export crops these risks would be somewhat higher for the diversifi-
cation activities. However, technical assistance and training is provided
under the project to minimize these risk. Management risks would be greater,
because of the current organizational and management problems (Chapter 6).
Management technical assistance has, therefore, been included in the project,
and hiring of management consultants is a condition of Credit Effectiveness.
The smallholder component presents the greatest risk because of the inexpe-
rience and organizational weakness of the TSHDA which may limit the partici-
pation of smallholders. For this reason, this is a pilot component, account-
ing for a very small portion of project costs.
X. RECOMMENDATIONS
10.01     At negotiations, the following assurances were given by GOSL:
a.   The agencies will submit their financial statements (in-
cluding Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Sources and
Applications of Funds Statement) and project accounts, for
audit and to IDA within four months of fiscal year end
(para 5.09);
b.   Audit of all project accounts, and of JEDB, SPC, and
TSHDA financial statements will be completed within eight
months of fiscal year end and audited statements made
available to IDA immediately thereafter (para 5.10);
c.   The supervision structure of the Regional Boards will be
rationalized (para 6.03);



- 43 -
d.   The Management consultants  recommendations will be dis-
cussed with the Association by August 31, 1983 and
following agreed revisions as required, implementation
will begin by December 1, 1983 (para 6.04);
e.   Tea margins will be reviewed at least once every year
before May 31, and the findings of the review including
actions to ensure reasonable financial returns to tea
producers will be discussed with IDA. GOSL will then
agree on a plan of actions to ensure financial returns
to tea producers (para 8.06).
f.   GOSL will ensure that the two corporations maintain:
i.   Current Ratio above 1.3, and
ii. Proportion of Long Term Debt to Equity below 70 to 30
(para 8.07); and
g.   A field-by-field evaluation of current and potential
yields will be done for each field proposed to be
replanted in high country project area and only those
fields will be replanted for which NPV at 12% is posi-
tive and higher than for alternatives (para 9.05).
10.02     Additional conditions of credit Effectiveness are as follows:
a.   Signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOSL and
SPC, JEDB and BOC, satisfactory to IDA (para 5.04).
b.   Hiring of management consultants, acceptable to IDA
(para 6.04);
c.   Transfer of project estates from LRC to SPC and JEDB
(para 8.07).
10.03     With these conditions and assurances, the proposed project is
suitable for an IDA Credit of US$20.0 M to GOSL.

TEA REHABILITATION AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
Glossary
Clonal or Vegetatively Propagated (VP) Tea
Genetically identical tea bushes produced by taking cuttings from selected
superior mother bushes.
Old Seedling Tea (OST)
Genetically diverse tea bushes produced from tea seed; highly variable in all
characters including growth characteristics, leaf size (jat) and yield.
Inf illing
The procedure of filling gaps left by dead tea bushes with new plants; always
coincides with field pruning to reduce competition between the infilled plants
and mature bushes.
Orthodox Tea Manufacturing Process
Withering: Ambient or hot air is blown through green leaf by a fan to reduce
moisture. Traditionally, this process is carried on hessian or nylon racks
(tats). Tats are being replaced by troughs to introduce control over the
withering process.
Rolling: Process of twisting withered leaf by means of rotating plates (rollers)
to rupture leaf tissues and induce oxidization.
Fermentation: Enzyme oxidation of polyphenols in tea leaf.
Fixing: A tea drying process which stops fermentation and reduces moisture
content of the leaf to about 3%. After fixing, tea becomes stable to handle.
Grading (Sorting): Dried tea (made tea) is sifted over wire mesh to separate
different sizes of tea particles. Sorted tea is classified into the following
main grades Broken Orange Pekoe (BOP), BOP Fannings (BOPF) and Dust I. These
grades are in descending order of particle size.

Rupee in 1981 (about 18 percent, from the 1980 annual average
of Rs. 16.50 = $1 to Rs 19.50 = $1) and the decline in tea
prices (7 percent).
