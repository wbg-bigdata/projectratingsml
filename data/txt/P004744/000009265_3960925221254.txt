PROJECT COMPLETION RlPORT
THAILAND
SRIKIT PETROLEUM PROJECT
(Loan 2639-T1I)
Prcface
This is the Project Completion teport (PCR) for the Sirikit
Petroleum Project in Thailand, for which Loan 2639-TH to the Petroleum
Authority of Thailand in the amount of US$33 million was approved on
December 3, 1985. The loan was closed undisbursed on August 29, 1989, one
year ahead of schedule, following partial cancellations of U$S13.0 million
on July 1, 1986, and US$19 million on September 1, 1988.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations
Division of Country Department II of the Asia Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and by the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final
supervision of the project in October 198", and is based, inter alia, on
the President's Report; the Loan and Guarantee Agreements; supervision
reports; and internal Bank memoranda.



PROJECr COMPLETION REPORT

SIRIKIT PETROLEUM PROJECr
(Loan 2639-T
Evaluation Summary
The project was conceived in 1982-83 following the discovery by Thai
Shell of the Sirikit oil field in central Thailand (Block S-1), which was
the first significant domestic discovery of indigenous crude oil. The
Sirikit discovery, together with other exploration results, had led to an
upward revision in Thailand's oil production expectations.  The possibility
of establishing a domestic oil production capability was an attractive
prospect for Thailand given its high dependence on impc.rted energy. The
project was formulated with a view to optimizing Thailand's returns from
the Sirikit discovery and promoting further exploration and development of
petroleum resources. More generally, the project was intended to support
the Government's strategy to strengthen domestic technical capabilities to
monitor the exploration and development ("upstream") activities of
international oil companies (IOCs) in Thailand, partly as a necessary
accompanying measure to participation in joint-venture projects, a number
of which were on the horizon aside from the Sirikit venture.
The Government designated the state oil company, the Petroleum
Authority of Thailand (PTT), as its executing agency. To facilitate its
participation in upstream activities, PTT established a wholly-owned
subsidiary, PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP), to act as its operating
entity in the joint-venture with Thai Shell as well as in any other
upstream petroleum operations that could come about.
Proiect Obiectives
The project had three cajor objectives: (a) to build up the
necessary expertise for PTT to represent government interests in petroleum
ventures; (b) to increase the net revenues to Thailand from oil discoveries
in the Block S-1 concession; and (c) to strengthen government knowledge of
the potential of other concessions so as to help expedite ongoing
negotiations with IOCs.
The project consisted of two components: (a) the establishment and
investment program of the Sirikit joint venture; and (b) a technical
assistance and training component.



iU
Implementation Experience and Results
The project has been implemented succesfully, albeit with some
variance from original expectations. However, for a number of reasons, no
use was made of the Bank loan which was eventually cancelled in full on
August 29, 1989,
While the project was prepared at a time when oil prices reached
their highest historical levels, subsequent investment decisions b; the
operator (Thai Shell) were to be severely affected by the drop in oil
prices that ensued starting in 1985. This reduction in the investment
program had a disproportionate effect on the cash flow position of the
joint-venture, which remained positive in all single years thereafter,
tlhereby precluding PTTEP's need to use the Bank loan to cover shortfalls in
funds (cash calls). This development was exacerbated by a lack of
significant new oil discoveries after the loan was signed that would have
justified additional development investment. Yet, the results of the
Joint-Venture Component met or exceeded appraisal expectations, both in
terms of production volumes and return on investment (Part I, paras 11 and
13).
The Training and Technical Assistance Component of the project was
implemented as planned but also without recourse to Bank financing, as
PTTEP was able to identify grant funds for each of the items included in
the project scope or to finance the item out of its own resources as PTT's
finances improved. The results of the component are mixed but generally
positive (Part I, para 14). In general, the institution building objective
of the project was achieved, perhaps beyond appraisal expectations (Part I,
para 15).
Sustainability
Output from the Sirikit field has proved sustainable and profitable.
Moreover, the project has been instrumental in establishing PTTEP's
capability to analyze the benefits of future similar joint-venture options.
Actually, a solid basis for Thai participation in upstream petroleum
ventures has been formed largely on the basis of the project experience
(Part I, para 16).
Findings and Lessons-Learned
The project documentation probably was not sufficiently explicit
about the contingency nature of the proposed use of the loan proceeds and
therefore of the risk that the funds might not be utilized in full, should
economic conditions change. In particular, the appraisal did not address
the risk that a substantial reduction and stretch-out of the operator's
investment program would likely occur should a change in oil prices
substantially affect the economics of field development, thereby affecting
the use of Bank funds. On the other hand, the justification for the loan
remained, as it provided the necessary cushion to facilitate PTT's
investment decision at a time when its financial standing was not



iv
sufficiently strong to proceed with the investment. While the SAR did not
clearly state the risk of the funds not being utilized, it is not clear how
else the Bank handles contingent financing needs.

B. lBackground
1.       When the project was conceived, Thailand's identified petroleum
endowment consisted essentially of a number of gas fields, located mostly
offshore, some of which were already under development. Recent exploration
results had also led to an upward revision in oil production expectations.
Particularly significant in this regard was the discovery by Shell of the
Sirikit oil field in central Thailand. The possibility of establishing a
domestic oil production capability was an attractive prospect for Thailand
given its high dependence on imported energy: at the time of project appraisal
in October, 1984, imported petroleum accounted for 76% of commercial energy
requirements and 41% of total energy consumption. The petroleum import bill
amounted to 25% of total imports and absorbed 39% of foreign exchange earn-
ings. The project was conceived as an instrument to surport Thailand's
objectives of optimizing its returns from the Sirikit di. *very and promoting
further exploration and development of petroleum resources.
2        The discovery made by Thai Shell (a wholly-owr,ed subsidiary of Royal
Dutch Shell) in December 1981 on the S-1 license located in the Phitsanulok
Basin onshore central Thailand was the first significant discovery of indige-
nous crude oil. The S-1 license had been awarded to Thai Shell in 1979.
Appraisal drilling had followed and the discovery which came to be known as
the Sirikit field was declared commercial and a production license awarded
early in 1983. Thai Shell started to implement an early production plan
immediately thereafter.
3.       The license agreement provided that Thai Shell, upon request from the
Government, had the option to grant the Government a up to 25% working
interest in the license. Prior to making such a request for participation,
the Government designated the state oil company, the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand (PTT), as its executing agency and requested the Bank to assist PTT
in formulating a joint-venture project and to provide financing as required.
4.       Thai Shell's terms for granting the option provided that:  (a) PTT
would reimburse Thai Shell for 25% of all net past investment, i.e. capital
expenditures and operating costs less accrued revenue from January 1, 1982
onward; (b) ambiguities in the terms of the license regarding the pricing of
oil refined and sold domestically would be satisfactorily resolved; and (c)
25% of all future cash shortfall would be paid promptly on a monthly basis
(cash calls). PTT, with Bank assistance, determined that it was in the
interest of the Government to meet Thai Shell's conditions: the economic rate
of return on investment was deemed attractive and the experience to be gained
from PTT's involvement advantageous.
5.       More generally, the Bank supported the Government's and PTT's
strategy to strengthen their technical capability to monitor the exploration
and development ("upstream") activities of international oil companies (IOCs)
in Thailand, partly as a necessary accompanying measure to participation in
joint-ventures with IOCs, a number of which were on the horizon aside from the
Thai Shell venture. While the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) of the
Ministry of Industry remained the depository of government authority in



- 3 -
administering IOCs' licenses, PTT was to act as the operating arm of the
Government for future public invest.ment in the sector.  To facilitate its
participation in upstream activities, PTT established a wholly-owned subsid-
iary, PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP), to act as its operating entity
in the joint-venture with Thai Shell as well as in any other upstream
petroleam operations that could come about. PTTEP was to be responsible for
the accrued buy-in cost of the joint-venture, which was determined to be
US$46.25 million and was financed from loans from the parent company PTT, the
Ministry of Finance, and Thai commercial banks.
C. Project Objectivcs and Dcscription
6.       The project had three maior objectives: (a) through participation in
the S-1 joint-venture, to give PTT practical experience in oil and gas
operations so as to build up the necessary expertise for PTT to represent
government interest as a minority partner in petroleum ventures; (b) to
increase the net revenues accruing to Thailand from the development of
discoveries in the Block S-1 concession; and (c) to strengthen government
knowledge of the potential of other concessions so as to help expedite ongoing
negotiations with IOCs dealing with a number of undeveloped discoveries.
7.       The project consisted of two components:
(a) Establishment and Investment Program of Sirikit Joint Venture
Anticipated investments (over and above PTT's buy-in cost) included
further geological and geophysical surveys, exploration and
development drilling, production facilities at the field (including a
small liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) recovery facility) and any sole
risk investments that may be prudent for PTTEP to undertake.
(b) Technical Assistance and Training
Consultancies and studies to strengthen PTT's (PTTEP's) technical
capabilities in assessing other joint-venture options, including
studies required to determine PTTEP's options in regards to the Texas
Pacific offshore "B" gas field, its possible participation in Esso's
Khorat Basin gas discovery, the scope for promoting foreign investor
interest in offshore Block 5/27 which had been granted to PTT
following relinquishment by Amoco, and such other technical
assistance and training as would be required to help build up PTTEP
as an institution.
8.       The Bank loan, which was made in an amount of US$33 million to PTT
for onlending to PTTEP, was expected to cover the cash calls occasionned by
PTTEP's participation in the S-1 joint-venture (i.e., 25X of the net cash flow



- 4 -
of the joint venture) and the foreigni exchange cost of the techinical
assistance and training component.l/
D. Project Design and Organization
9.       The project concept, which was clear and accepted by all parties,
including Thai Shell, was rather innovative for the Bank in that the Bank loan
was not expected to finance a clearly defined investment program but rather to
cover the Borrower's share of the net cash flow position of a venture whose
future investment program, to be decided on an annual basis by the Operating
Committee, could only be estimated at the time of appraisal (partly on the
basis of discussions with the operator). While participation in such a
discovery held the potential of additional benefits for the host country, it
entailed some degree of financial uncertainty for the minority partner and
placed an additional burden on the country, two constraints which the loan was
intended to help alleviate.
E Project Implementation
10.      The project has been implemented succesfully, albeit with some
variance from original expectations. However, for a number of reasons
discussed below, no use was made of the Bank loan which was eventually
cancelled in full on August 29, 1989.2/
11.      While the project was prepared at a time when oil prices reached
their highest historical levels, subsequent investment decisions by the
operator were to be severely affected by the drop in oil prices that ensued
starting in 1985. Actually, almost immediately after the loan became
effective, the price of Sirikit oil plummeted from US$24.50/barrel (bbl) in
1985 to an average of US$15.4/bbl and a low of US$9.60/bbl in 1986 (see Part
III, Graphs 1 and 2). This sudden and unexpected price decline had a profound
effect on Thai Shell's investment program, which was reduced from US$111
million to US$37 million in 1986 and was to remain at low levels for the next
several years (see Part III, Graph 3). While this reduction in the investment
program proved prudent and was justified by the drastic change in oil price
conditions, it had a disproportionate effect on the cash flow position of the
joint-venture, which remained positive in all single years thereafter, thereby
precluding PTTEP's need to use the Bank loan to cover shortfalls in funds
i/ The Bank loan was expected to cover the financing gap for future cash
calls, estimated at US$25 million, and US$8 million of technical assistance
and studies.
2/ While the reduced need for Bank financing became apparent as early as mid
1986 (and partial cancellations were effected on July 1, 1986 (US$13 million)
and September 1, 1988 (US$19 million)), the Borrower indicated it wished to
keep the loan in force so as to avail itself of regular supervision missions
by Bank staff.



(cash calls). This development was exacerbated by a lack of significant new
oil discoveries after the loan was signed that would have justified additional
development investment. An additional factor was the delay in installing the
l.PG recovery plant (utilizing associated gas production) which led to a
further reduction in investment during the critical first few years of project
implementation when the cash flow position was expected to be the tig;itest.
12.      The Training and Technical Assistance component of the project was
implemented as planned but also without recourse to Bank financing as PTTEP
was able to identify grant funds for each of the items included in the project
description or to finance the item out of its own resources as PTT's finances
improved. These have included: (a) reservoir studies for simulation of the
Sirikit field (financed by PTTEP at a cost of approximately US$500,000); (b)
consultant services to PTTEPI/ (financed by PTTEP at a cost to date of
US$500,000); (c) consultancy study for reserve determination and development
analysis of the offshore "B" gas field, which was carried out by Statoil under
grant financing provided by the Norwegian Government at a cost of
approximately US$5 million; (e) data gathering and processing to help promote
Block 5/27 (initially licensed to PTT) to foreign partners, including a
partial 3-D seismic survey and analysis, were undertaken with assistance from
Petro-Canada under grant financing provided by CIDA in an estimated amount of
US$4 million; (f) training was provided by Petro Canada (under the above
grant) in the form of in-house seminars and by Thai Shell in the form of on-
site work exposure as provided under the joint venture contract; the cost of
staff participation in international seminars was covered by PTTEP's own
funds; and (g) the cost of computer hardware and software to build up PTTEP's
analytical capabilities was also covered by PTTEP's internal funds. An
additional study anticipated at the time of appraisal to help determine the
extent of reserves at the (Esso) Namphong gas field in the Khorat basin and
establish or otherwise the economics of its development has not yet been done
due to delays in Esso's long-term testing program, the results of which will
be critical inputs in the analysis.
F. Project Results
13.      The results of the Joint-Venture Compo,ient of the project met or
exceeded appraisal expectations:
(a) Ultimate Oil and Gas Recovery from S-1 License Area. Recovery from
the S-1 license was estimated at the time of appraisal at 80 million
barrels (bbls). The current estimate is now between 100-120 million
bbls. Ultimate gas production was estimated to be about 300 billion
cubic feet (Bcf) and this level is expected to be achieved. One
should note, however, that while about one third of the ultimate oil
and gas recovery was expected to originate from new discoveries, the
3/ One full-time exploration consultant was recruited by PTTEP instead of two
as anticipated at appraisal (one for exploration and appraisal and one for
production and reservoir engineering).



- 6 -
latter are now expected to contribute only 2% of total recovery.
Wlile growth in existing reserves more than made up for the lack of
new discoveries, the investmenit required to develop the reserves was
less than anticipated and the rate of return was correspondingly
increased.
(b) Production. Due to the increase in reserves, peak pleteau production
is expected to continue through 1992 for oil and 2002 for gas (see
Part III, Graphs 4 and 5) while at appraisal oil production was
expected to start declining in 1990 and gas production in 1994. In
addition, some 125,000 tons/year of LPG and 226,000 bbl/year of
condensate are expected to be produced when the LPG recovery plant
comes on stream in 1990. These latter volumes were not included in
the appraisal estimate of benefits (because of the low priority given
to the LPG investment by the operator) although a notional US$35
million investment in LPG recovery was included in the project cost
estimate.
(c) Economic Rate of Return. The appraisal estimate of the economic
return on investment was 15%. The revised estimate is about 29% as
lower oil prices were more than offset by the larger volumes and the
reduced and extended investment profile (see Part III, Annex 2).
14.      The results of the Technical Assistance and Training Component are
mixed but generally positive:
(a)  S-1 Engineering Studies.  At the time of appraisal, annual updates of
the reservoir studies for the S-1 license were expected to be
required. However, the consultant candidly determined following the
first update that the number and complexity of reservoirs made this
impractical. PTTEP and Bank staff concurred.
(b) In-house Consultancy. At the time of appraisal, it had been deemed
advisable for PTTEP to engage two highly experienced consultants to
provide full-time in-house assistance to interface with Thai Shell
(one advising on exploration and appraisal and one advising on
production and reservoir engineering). PTTEP eventually engaged only
one consultant whose experience was sufficiently broad to meet
PTTEP's needs satisfactorily. Bank staff concurred.
(c) Reserve and Development Study for the Offshore "B" Structure. At the
time of appraisal, it had been deemed advisable to engage an
international consulting firm to provide an independent analysis of
the "B" structure prospects (under license with Texas-Pacific and a
few other minority partners) since the possibility of buying out
Texas Pacific was considered as a possible option to expedite the
development of this gas resource. An earlier reserve determination
had already been made on behalf of Texas Pacific but the study was
considered deficient in several key areas. The study made under
Norwegian financing was considered an acceptable replacement even
though the lack of detailed background data provided in the study has
in effect precluded its critical review by Bank staff. PTTEP



ultimately purchased the Texas Pacific et al interest based on the
Statoil findings; PTTEP is now in the final stage of acquiring
operating and non-operating partners to develop the field.
(d)  Reserve and Development Study for the Nemphong Gas Field.  It was
foreseen at appraisal that a detailed study would be beneficial prior
to PTTEP's deciding on exercising its option to participate in the
development of the field as a minority (20%) partner. However, the
study required the results of a lengthy testing program by Esso to
reach meaningful results. The testing program has been delayed and
is now expected to be conducted in 1990-92 and the study has yet to
be made. In the meanwhile PTTEP is in the process of concluding a
joint-venture agreement with Esso.
(e) 3-D Seismic Survey and Promotion of Offshore Block 5/27 to Industry.
Prior to project appraisal, PTT had been granted exploration rights
on Block 5/27 following its relinquishment by Amoco. Since Amoco had
produced oil at rates considered by them as noncommercial, activities
required to pursue the evaluation of the block, i.e. a 3-D seismic
survey, with a view to promoting it to IOCs were included in the
project scope. As indicated above, Petro Canada provided a 3-D
seismic survey on a limited area surrounding the Amoco discoveries.
Bank staff assisted in the analysis of results. These were found to
be of average quality only and additional processing of the data
would be useful. However, due to subsequent discoveries offshore (by
Thai Shell and Premier Oil Co.) investor interest in Block 5/27 is
now fairly high and PTTEP plans to organize a promotion campaign on
the basis of available data.
(f) Training. The project provided for overseas training in the form of
short courses, seminars, participation in international technical
meetings and conventions, and interface with foreign consultants.
PTTEP took some advantage of its staff's exposure to visiting
consultants and, more generally, substituted in-house courses and on-
the-job training provided by Thai Shell in fulfillment of their joint
venture contract for overseas training. Overall, this route proved
satisfactory although additional training would have been beneficial.
The problem facing PTTEP at the outset of the project was the
shortage of qualified staff and this has made it difficult to
comfortably accommodate the requirements of an intensive overseas
training.
(g) Computer Hardware and Software. At the time of appraisal the
acquisition of greater computer capability was seen as a critical
need for PTTEP. However, PTTEP was able to gradually and
incrementally add to their computer capability without large
expenditures. This need was probably overstated at appraisal and
probably should not have been highlighted as a specific loan
component.
15.      The institution building objective of the project was achieved,
perhaps beyond appraisal expectations. At the outset PTTEP was thinly staffed



- 8 -
(eight professionals) with only limited experience, and building an
organization adequately staffed without prejudice to ongoing project activity
was considered a formidable challenge. However, through new hires of
experienced personnel from oil companies and the government (particularly the
Department of Mineral Resources), transfers from PTT as well as by hiring
recent graduates in petroleum specialties, PTTEP has been able to build up its
staff to about 75 professionals with adequate support staff and superior
office facilities. Both PTT and PTTEP are to be commended for this
development. While some need for further institutional strengthening remains,
PTTEP can now face future new challenges with justified confidence.
G. Project Sustainabdity
16.      Output from the Sirikit field has proved sustainable and profitable:
production should continue until at least the year 2,000 and likely beyond.
If at some future date Thai Shell decides to withdraw, PTTEP should be able to
operate the field on their own and should start preparing for this possible
eventuality. Moreover, the project has been instrumental in establishing
PTTEP's capability to analyze the benefits of similar joint-venture options in
the future. Actually, a solid basis for Thai participation in upstream
petroleum ventures has been formed largely on the basis of the project
experience.
IL Bank Performance
17.      The Bank performed well, assisting the Borrower at all stages of the
project. In retrospect, the Bank's recommendation to PTT to go ahead with the
Sirikit investment and build up the institutional capability necessary to
handle such participations in upstream petroleum ventures was appropriate.
Project supervision by Bank staff was also useful to smooth out the teething
problems in the relationship between PTTEP and the operator during the initial
period (in regards to such items as access to data, review of work program,
etc). From the Bank standpoint, the project documentation probably was not
sufficiently explicit about the contingency nature of the proposed use of loan
proceeds and therefore of the risk that available funds might not be utilized
in full in the event of changes in economic conditions. In particular, the
appraisal did not address the risk that a substantial reduction or stretch-out
of the operator's investment program would likely occur, should a change in
oil prices substantially affect the economics of field development. With the
benefit of hindsight, it appears that evaluation of investment requirements
were driven more by the geological potential of the venture perceived at the
time of appraisal rather than by considerations of expected financial return
to the operator. On the other hand, the justification for the loan remained,
as it provided the necessary cushion to facilitate PTT's investment decision
at a time when its financial standing was not sufficiendly strong to proceed
with the investment. Moreover, while the SAR did not clearly state the risk
of the funds not being utilized, it is not clear how else the Bank handles
contingent financing needs.

1. PBrrower Performance
18.      The Borrower, PTT and indirectly its subsidiary PTTEP, allocated a
substantial proportion of their managerial resources to the success of the
project. Personnel performance, both managerial and technical, was always of
a high quality. Collaboration with the Bank was also always highly
cooperative.
J. Project Relationships
19.      The relationships between the Borrower, the Bank and Thai Shell were
both smooth and cordial. Bank staff played a key role in maintaining good
relations between the parties.
20.      Thai Shell became disturbed with the Bank at the time of appraisal
when the Bank recommended that an LPG recovery plant be included in the
forecast investment program. Thai Shell feared that this would encourage
PTTEP to force a decision upon them that they were not yet prepared to
take.4/ Bank staff assured Thai Shell that this was not the Bank's intent
but that the Bank's intention was rather to make appropriate provisions for
all likely future investments. Further, Bank staff persuaded PTTEP to work
closely with Thai Shell, and at their pace, on this investment component.
Ultimately, the LPG recovery plant was included in the investment program and
is expected to prove a particularly attractive project component with a
payback period of about two years and a fifteen-year life.
K. Consulting Services
21.      The Bank assisted PTTEP in obtaining high-quality consulting services
for assistance in their day-to-day contact with Thai Shell. The presence of
the in-house consultant provided assurance to PTTEP that the joint venture was
conducted in a business-like and equitable manner; the services provided by
the consultant are considered highly satisfactory.
22.      The Bank reviewed and commented on the various studies and surveys
conducted by consultants under bilateral grant financing. On the whole, these
services appear to have been conducted in a professional manner and to have
been satisfactory and useful to PTTEP.
4/ This was largely due to the fact that Thai Shell had not officially
credited associated gas cap reserves in one of the major reservoirs, which
they were to do at a later stage.

L Project Documcntation and Data
23.      Both the President's Report and Loan Documents provided adequate
framework for project implementation. Supervision reports were complete and
provided adequate documentation of the progress of the project.
24.      While much of the data gathered to prepare this PCR was obtained from
retained Bank information, details of physical activities and expenditures
were obtained from PTTEP during a completion mission in November 1989.



Project Completion Report
TILAILAND
SIRIT PETROLEUM PROJECT
(Loan 2639-TH)
Part 11: Proect Review from Borrowers Perspective



- 12 -
A. Comments on Part I
The Sirikit Petroleum Project Completion Report is a
concise and clear presentation of the project, the
objectives and results.  As stated in the report, we agree
that the objectives of the project were fully met.
PTTEP has markedly improved the expertise to represent
the government interest in petroleum joint ventures.   The
company is now structured along the lines of an
international petroleum company, has been able to attract
new and experienced personnel and is growing rapidly.  The
revenues generated for the government of  Thaialnd has met
or exceeded all expectations.  Further, having gained from
the experience of the project,   PTTEP has now comfortably
entered into other concession agreements; the "B" Structure
development program with Total, British Gas and Statoil, and
the agreement with Esso for the development of the Nam Phong
gas  field.    In addition,  PTTEP concluded  a  farm-out
agreement with British Gas for an exploration project over
offshore Block 5/27.   Also,  PTTEP has concluded a Joint
Venture Agreement with Unocal and their partner, Mitsui Oil
Exploration, for a 5 per cent interest in the Unocal II area
under terms of the Unocal III Gas Sales Agreement with PTT.
The most unique venture        have been concluded is with
Unocal for a 10 per cent participation in their "F" Block in
Burma. This would represent the first experiment for PTTEP
to become engaged in activities outside the country in a
relatively unexplored area with some considerable risk
elements.
From the foregoing, it is clear the project of the Bank
initiated a series of events, allowing PTTEP to blossom into
genuine upstream institution. The technical advice from the
Bank was invaluable in directing PTTEP toward starting on
the right path and played a strong role in keeping PTTEP
going along that path.   For this  PTTEP  is extremely
grateful.



- 1 3 -
There is concern expressed in the report over the fact
that the funds were not utilized.   From our vantage point
the availability of the funds gave impetus to participation
in the joint venture and ultimately to the ensuing activity.
It is questionable that  anyone in the petroleum industry
foresaw the sharp and dramatic reduction in petroleum
prices.  The operator's investment program was an internal
decision and the lack of success in finding other
substantial petroleum reserves is part of the risks
associated with any upstream venture. Another factor which
affected utilization of the funds was in the area of
training and technical assistance. This part of the project
was not only affected by the factors described in the
report, including the internal constraints, but also to the
program granted bv the Petro-Canada International Assistance
Corporation (PCIAC) to PTT, for which PTTEP received
benefits through a significant training program of
concentrated classroom sessions and selected on-the-job
training in Canada.
B. Bank's Performance
The Bank's performance during the evaluation and
implementation must be classified as superior.   A complete
assessment of the requirements of the Borrower was
conducted, which resulted in a set of meaningful objectives.
Representatives of the Bank were most helpful in the initial
stages of the project in assisting to establish a smooth
relationship  between  PTTEP  and the Operator.    Their
assistance in obtaining consultancy service was extremely
useful.   The Bank's recommendation to include the LPG
recovery plant in the investment profile proved to be very
beneficial.  Today the plant is in place and working.  The
economics of the plant is anticipated to be extremely
favorable and should improve the overall economics of the
project.



- 14 -
C. Borrower's Performance
The Borrower's performance during evaluation and
implementation was primarily to learn as much as possible,
to maintian good relations with all parties involved in the
project and to work toward meeting the stated objectives.
PTTEP followed the Bank's recommendations to the extent
possible within the limits of a fluctuating business
environment. The relations with the Operator have continued
to improve over the years and PTTEP now enjoys a good
working  relationship with Shell.    The  confidence gained
through the project by PTTEP is profound and this, compiled
with the favorable economics, is a measure of the success of
all of the parties involved in the project.
D. Relationship between Bank and Borrower
The effectiveness of the relationship between the Bank
and the Borrower has been touched on throughout this paper.
However, PTT believes the relationship during both the
evaluation and implementation phases of the project was
excellent.
E. Adequacy and Accuracy of Part III
With regard to Part III, details of activities and
expenditures were obtained from PTTEP during November 1989.
It has been impossible for us to ascertain exactly who
provided the figures. However, attached are six data sheets
provided by the PTTEP   Finance and Accounting Sections.
These include the financial analysis for the project and
details of the projection from 1990 onward.
For the financial statement an explanation of the
Petroleum Tax is needed.   Petroleum Tax is calculated as
0.50 (net Profit + Interest-Royalty).   Interest is not
allowed as a deduction against tax and the income tax rate
is 50 percent of net profit less royalty.



- 15 -
The difference between the projections prepared by Bank staff (shown
in Part I of the PCR) and those prepared by PTTEP (shown in Part II)
results largely from:
(a) differences in oil production assumptions: PTTEP's projections
are predicated on the operator's production plan for 1990-93
with a declining trend thereafter, The Bank projections, which
were developped during the PCR mission, are based on the
expectation of a probable upgrading of produced volumes by the
operator in future projections, as has happened historically,
both in terms of reserve upgrading and increases in recoverable
fraction; and
(b) differences in cost allocation between operating and capital
expenditures.
The overall results, however, as encapsulated in ROR calculations,
show a high degree of convergence between the two sets of calculations.

Appraisal          Actual
Economic Rate of Return:                            15%               29%
(See Annex 2 for calculations)
Underlying AssumDtions:
a) Future production rates based on operator (Thai Shell) forecast through
1992, Bank staff estimates thereafter (checked as reasonable by Thai Shell);
b) oil price forecast: Bank OPEC basket forecast of 1/22/1990 discounted by
8.5% (as per sales contract); gas, LPG and condensate prices proportional to
oil price forecast;
c) PTTEP overhead cost escalated at 6% per year from 1990;
d) income tax set at 50% of net profit.
F2. Financial Impact
Return to PTTEP
Internal rate of return on investment:         23%
(See Annex 1 for calculations) a/
a) The revised estimate of the internal rate of return is calculated by PTT
at 29%. Differences in underlying assumptions are explained in Page 15.
