MAURITIUS
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
I.  DEVELOPMENT AND HUMAN RESOURCES
Background
1.01      The island of Mauritius lies in the Indian Ocean about 500 miles
east of Madagascar. The land is of volcanic origin which accounts for its
general fertility and suitability for sugarcane production, but the country
has no significant mineral resources. The early permanent settlers were the
Dutch in the 17th Century and later the French who established sugar plan-
tations which came to dominate the Mauritian economy. In 1810 the British
took sovereignty during the Napoleonic wars.
1.02      Labor for sugar production was first met by slaves from Madagascar
until slavery was abolished in 1830. Thereafter the British depended on
India for the supply of labor to Mauritius. The colonial history of
Mauritius ended with Independence from Britain in 1968. The diversity of
Mauritius' ethnic and religious communities (50% Hindus, 30% of French,
African and Creole origin, 17% Indo-Pakistani Moslems, 3% Chinese) has a
major influence on the country's political and economic life. Despite the
emergence of a distinctive Mauritian culture, each ethnic group holds to
its language, religion and customs. In these circumstances the Government
has attempted with considerable success to reconcile the interests of the
various groups.
1.03      Economic growth of Mauritius since Independence has been rapid.
Real GDP grew at 8.1% p.a. between 1970 and 1976, and per capita GNP grew from
US$350 in 1970 to US$680 in 1976. Three major features have become apparent
in the course of this rapid economic development: (a) the dominance of the
sugar industry; (b) the increasing importance of the manufacturing sector;
and (c) the abundance of labor.
1.04      The total area under sugarcane cultivation is about one half the
island's area. The share of sugar production in GDP grew from 27% in 1970
to 53% in 1974, although it declined to 45% in 1975 due to damage caused by
a cyclone. The shares of sugar in total employment and commodity exports
are now about 30% and 85% respectively. Mauritius has tried to reduce the
risk of excessive dependence on monoculture, but with only limited success
(some tea and tobacco). Efforts are therefore being made to expand other
sectors such as manufacturing, tourism and construction. The growth of the
manufacturing industry has been particularly impressive. It grew at 17.1%
p.a. in real terms from 1970 to 1975 or about twice as fast as the growth in
real GDP. As a result, the share of manufacturing in GDP increased from
8% to 13%. This rapid increase is mainly due to a shift in emphasis from



import-substituting industries in the 1960's financed mainly from domestic
resources, to export industries financed mainly by foreign investment. The
Export Processing Zone Act (EPZ) of 1970 grants a package of incentives to
enterprises establishing factories bonded to sell their entire output out-
side the country. By 1975, 66 enterprises had been established with 11,400
workers mostly In the activities of textiles and electronic components. But,
the first wave of EPZ applicants has now subsided.
1.05      Despite recent rapid economic growth, Mauritius suffers from un-
employment and heavy population pressure. Mauritius has kept systematic
records of the population since 1870. In the 1950's the population in-
creased at a high rate of about 3% p.a. The rate declined to 2.2% p.a. in
the 1960's and further to 1.2% p.a. in the 1970-75 period. The annual crude
birth rate (i.e., live births per 1,000) dropped from 38.5 in 1962 to 22.7
in 1973, and then increased slightly to 25.6 in 1976. Mauritius has expe-
rienced one of tVe fastest rates of fertility decline. However, with an
area of 2,000 km and a total population of 908,000, the average density is
about 450 persons per square kilometer, which is one of the highest in the
world among agricultural countries.
1.06      A most pressing socio-economic problem in Mauritius arises from
unemployment. In contrast with the fast growth of recent years, in the 1960's
the economy grew only at a rate of 1% p.a. although the labor force grew then
at nearly 3% p.a. The level of unemployment rose from 6% (10,700) in 1968 to
16% (41,800) by 1972. Coupled with rapid economic growth, Government's
special efforts to relieve unemployment under the "Travail Pour Tous" program
such as the establishment in 1971 of the Development Works Corporation (DWC)
under the Ministry for Employment, reduced the unemployment rate to 11%
(30,000) in 1976. Nonetheless, labor surplus and the effective mobilization
of labor remain critical development issues.
Development Objective and Strategy
1.07      The Four-Year Plan for Social and Economic Development, 1971-75,
was followed by a Five-Year Plan for 1975-80. The basic objective in both
Plans is the achievement of full employment by 1980. As a strategy to attain
this objective, the current Plan aims at: (a) an annual GDP growth rate of
6.5% based mainly on the growth of the manufacturing sector; (b) an annual
employment growth rate of 4.7%; (c) development of human resources in terms
of improving the skill component of jobs and restructuring the educational
system; (d) strengthening of the technical and administrative capacity of the
Government; and (e) improved income distribution mainly through the creation
of jobs for the unemployed. This strategy underscores the particular impor-
tance of human resources development in Mauritius where population pressure
is heavy, and at the same time manpower is one of the most important resources
available.



-3-
Towards Full Employment
1.08      The Five-Year Plan defines full employment as 98% of the labor
force (those aged 15 and above who are employed, or unemployed but "actively"
seeking work) being employed. The remaining 2% is considered frictional
unemployment and includes those in transit between jobs or in the process
of placement among new entrants to the labor market. The Plan projects that
employment will increase at 4.7% p.a. from 240,000 in 1974 (the base year in
the Plan) to 316,000 in 1980, an increase of 76,000. Employment and
output in 1974 and the Plan targets for 1980 are as below:

/1   Temporary employment is expected to become permanent employment.
The table indicates that in terms of the employment generating capacity of
the marginal output, the investment in manufacturing compares favorably with
other sectors with an elasticity of 0.83, and shows the largest absolute in-
crease in employment.
1.09      It is unlikely that Mauritius will maintain until the mid-1980's the
annual rate of economic growth foreseen in the Plan. Output and employment
growth rates as summarized in the table below have been based on the estimate
that during the next ten years, real GDP will increase at an average rate of
about 5% p.a.

Although a slower economic growth than the Plan target of 6.5% p.a. is
assumed, the employment level in 1980 is estimated only slightly lower than
that foreseen in the Plan because the employment elasticities in manufactur-
ing and services are greater than in other sectors. Average annual employ-
ment created during the 1977-87 period is calculated at about 12,700.
1.10      If the Plan's projected population growth rate of 1.6% p.a. is
applied, the population will increase from 865,000 in 1975 to 936,000 in
1980 and to 1,049,000 in 1987. The present participation rates of the
population in the labor force are estimated at about 82% for males and 23%



- 5 -
for f.emales, making the overall rate 52%. If by 1985 the participation rate
for females rises to about 28%, while the rate for males remains constant at
82%, the labor force participation rate of the population will grow to 55%.
Thus, the labor force should increase from 282,000 in 1975 to 330,000 in
1980 and to 421,000 in 1987. The employment figures projected for the next
decade are compared with the increasing labor force as follows:
Projections of Labor Force and Employment, 1980 and 1987
1977           1980            1987
Labor Force (000)             298            330              421
Employment (000)              266            306              393
Rate of Employment (%)         89             93               93
The itable shows that over the 1975-80 Plan period, Mauritius is expected
to attain and maintain a 93% employment rate in comparison to the Plan
target of full employment at 98%. The employment rate is highly sensitive
not only to economic growth, but also to the participation rate of the labor
force. If, for example, instead of a participation rate of 55%, there is a
participation rate of 57% or 60% in 1987, the employment rate will decline
to 90% or 86% of the labor force.
Manpower Needs
1.11      On the basis of the 1972 census, the 1974 manpower survey and the
projected change in labor productivity, the percentage distribution of employ-
ment by occupation for the 1975-80 and 1981-87 periods is calculated as
below:

by Occupation, 1975-80 and 1980-87

1.12      Again on the basis of the 1974 manpower survey and educational
attainment of workers by age group as shown in the 1972 census 1/, the dis-
tribution of employment by education for 1975-80 and 1981-87 can be calcu-

1/   From the education profile of the employed of the 20-24 and 25-34 age
groups, it is assumed that approximately the following percentage change
in educational attainment of those employed in the late 1970's will occur
during 1981-87:

The above tables indicate that on the basis of reasonable assumptions as to
economic growth, the 1987 stock of manpower would consist of 23,600 profes-
sional and technical workers, 11,800 administrative and managerial workers,
39,300 clerical workers, 35,400 sales workers, 47,100 service workers, and
235,800 production workers. In terms of educational background this stock
of manpower would consist of 231,800 with primary education, 88,400 with
some secondary education, 53,100 with school certificates or equivalent,
5,900 with higher school certificates or equivalent and finally 13,800 with
degrees or diplomas.
1.14      In terms of the need to produce the educational output, not only
expansion in employment by occupation and education but also attrition (with-
drawals from the labor market for retirement, death, marriage, etc.) and
input to various levels of the education system have to be accounted for.
Assuming an average annual attrition rate of 2% (which is reasonable taking
into account the average age of the working population and the average work-
ing life), total additional requirement of manpower due to economic growth
and attrition during the 1977-87 period is calculated at 181,900. The break-
down of this total requirement by educational attainment is summarized below:
Additional Manpower Requirement by Educational Attainment, 1977-87

On the basis of the above projections, the education system needs to produce
the following additional output p.a. to provide intake for the different
levels of education: 1/
Primary school leavers                    12,000
Some secondary education or
equivalent to junior secondary
education                                6,800
School certificate or equivalent           2,200
Higher school certificate or
equivalent                               1,300
Therefore, to meet the needs of the labor market, attrition and education
programs, Mauritius would require annually a total of about 20,600 primary
school leavers, 11,800 junior secondary school leavers, 5,400 school cer-
tificate holders, and 2,600 higher school certificate/diploma/degree holders:

For education programs    12,000        6,800       2,200          1,300        -      22,300

1.15      In addition to producing a sufficient number of school leavers at
various levels, the education system is called upon to produce the "right"
kind of educational output.  In terms of quantity, the elimination of tuition
fees in January 1977 (para. 2.06) will have a significant effect on the supply
from the education system. In January 1977 virtually all primary school
leavers including those who had been out of school for a few years due to
inability to pay tuition fees, enrolled in the first year of secondary school.
1/   It is assumed that in the next ten years, the pass rates of the School
Certificate examination and the Higher School Certificate examination
will increase to 65% and 60% respectively.



- 9 -
As a result, there wiLl he few entrants to the labor market with only primary
education. Since the retention rate of the primary cycle is very high in
Mauritius, it can be assumed that on the average about 20,000 of the age group
-,rnulation are likely to proceed to secondary school annually.  As a result,
jibs that in the past have been filled by primary school leavers will in the
future be performed by junior secondary school leavers thereby upgrading
education qualification of the work force. This is in line with the develop-
ment strategy which aims at improving skill contents of jobs. In the 1980's
the average annual employment opportunities for junior secondary school
leavers would thus be about 13,000 including 8,000 jobs which in the early
1970's went to primary school leavers. This increased absorption of junior
secondary school leavers in the economy would leave a number of students -
about 7,000 - just enough to feed intake in Form IV of senior secondary
education.
1.16      Junior secondary school leavers would have the choice of entering
either the labor market or senior secondary education. In reality, however,
the number of registered unemployed is about 20,000, and at the same time,
a labor shortage exists in certain industries. Of the registered unemployed
about 60% have only primary education but 25% have some secondary education.
This suggests that job seekers with only primary education find it most diffi-
cult to be employed 1/ and that some job opportunities at the junior secondary
level have remained unfilled.
1.17      In Mauritius as in many other countries there is an imbalance
between the types of jobs to which young people aspire and the opportuni-
ties available. In the 1950's the growth rates of the population and the
labor force were much faster than the growth rate of employment, resulting
in an increasing number of the unemployed. In the 1960's not only did the
labor force grow faster than employment opportunities, but also the new
jobs were increasingly of an industrial nature as import substitution in-
dustries developed. Since 1970 export-oriented industrial development has
been emphasized; thus the literary focus of secondary education has become
of liLttle relevance for employment and caused a structural imbalance between
educational preparation and the industrial nature of the new jobs. One
of the most serious problems existing in the current labor market is the
diffiLculty in finding a sufficient number of secondary school leavers with
both the aptitudes and scientific, mathematical and technical qualifications
requiLred for the industrial sector.
1/   Bank staff interviewed 13 employers and administered a questionnaire
to 11 employers representing different industries. For semi-skilled
jobs which constitute a bulk of the job opportunities, they prefer to
employ applicants with some secondary education, i.e., junior secondary
school leavers. The returns on the questionnaire showed that the most
preferred educational background for semi-skilled workers is some sec-
ondary education with exposure to prevocational and practical subjects.
An analysis of School Certificate (SC) examinations shows a preponderance
of secondary students in the languages and the humanities but relatively
few in the science and in practical subjects (para. 2.21).



- 10 -
1 18      To tackle the emerging problem of structural imbalance between
supply and demand in the industrial labor market, various efforts are being
made, The establishment of the Mauritius Institute of Education (MIE) in
1972 is one of these efforts. The MIE is responsible for reorientation of the
curricula and for teacher training. The establishment of the Youth Guidance
Service under the Ministry for Employment is another effort to provide a
career preparation program for young school leavers. Also needed is an
institution to coordinate different occupational training programs in view of
the need for skilled workers. If it is assumed that of the required number of
production workers, 5% should be institutionally trained as skilled workers
and 10% as semi-skilled workers, the existing training programs seem to
provide an adequate capacity in numerical terms   However, whether or not the
existing facilities are adequate in terms of the relevance of the courses
offered, and the needs of industry, has yet to be fully assessed (paras.
2.31. 3.16 and 3.17).

II. EDUCATION POLICY, STRATEGY AND PROGRAMS
Policy and Strategy
2.01      The Government's policy for education development, stated in the
Plan for Social and Economic Development, 1975-80, is to "modernize" and
"Mauritianize" the education system. The strategy to implement this policy
consists of: (a) strengthening the technical and administrative capacity of
the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs (MECA); (b) improving equity
in access to educational opportunities; (c) reorientating the curricula to
reflect the needs of the Mauritian environment; and (d) providing the man-
power required for economic development.
Strengthening Management and Administration
2.02      The MECA's structure has developed according to the functions and
responsibilities defined in the Education Ordinance No. 39 of 1957. Many
amendments have been made since its promulgation and at present the Ordinance
is in need of review. The Ministry's main responsibility is the planning and
management of the formal education system. It directly controls 235 primary
schools, 11 public secondary schools, 5 handicrafts training centers, the
Industrial Trade Training Center and the Primary Teacher Training College.
It is, however, neither staffed nor organized to fulfill its tasks satisfac-
torily.
2.03      Recent expansion of the system (para. 2.09) has created an overload
on top management resulting in delays in communication and decision-making
processes. Until 1976 there was one permanent secretary; now there are two
to cope with the increase in work but there is no clear-cut delineation of
their functions. Similarly, the three chief education officers and the six
principal education officers do not have clearly assigned functions and
responsibilities. Tasks, duties and responsibilities are often assigned at
random, which leads to uncoordinated efforts among similar functional units.
The low efficiency of MECA is further compounded by the fact that the
Ministry's offices are located at eight different places in the capital
(Annex 1, Chart 3). Since telephone and mail service are poor, messengers
must be used for internal communication. It often takes several days for
inter-office memoranda to go from one unit to another. Rented office faci-
lities are also inadequate. Often three to five persons work in a space
sufficient for one person.
2.04      MECA has the responsibility to formulate sectoral plans and pro-
grams in close cooperation with the Ministry of Economic Planning and Devel-
opment and to provide direction to training and parastatal institutions in the
execution of these plans. However as there is no effective education planning,
as such, within MECA, the Ministry has not been able to fulfill these statutory
responsibilities and to effectively respond to the needs of the country. At
present the initiative for plan formulation originates almost entirely in the



- 12 -
Ministry of Economic Planning and Development and it is essential that the
Ministry of Education should develop a strong educational planning capacity
within the framework of a general reorganization of MECA (para. 3.03).
2.05      Partly to make up for the inadequacies of MECA, several parastatal
educational organizations have been established since 1968. They are financed
through the MECA budget and their heads report to the Minister of Education.
The Private Secondary Schools Authority (PSSA) controls and channels govern-
ment assistance to over 100 private secondary schools. The Mauritius Insti-
tute of Education (MIE) is responsible for curriculum development, examination
schemes and secondary school teacher training. The Mahatma Gandhi Institute
(MGI) promotes Indian culture, improves oriental language teacher training
and prepares related textbooks and teaching aids. The Mauritius College of
the Air (MCA) promotes education by means of radio and television broadcasts,
and correspondence courses. The University of Mauritius trains professional
and middle-level technical personnel. It is questionable, however, whether
the proliferation of parastatal educational agencies has benefitted the
sector; the matter needs urgent review especially since the management of
the sector has recently become so complex and the responsibilities of the
Ministry have increased greatly. This is an opportune time to reorganize the
entire Ministry and to make it a more functional organization to respond to
the many needs of an expanding education system.
Expanding Educational Opportunities
2.06      Since January 1977 education has been free at all levels, but not
compulsory. The present structure of formal education consists of primary
education (Standards 1 to 6), secondary education (Forms I to V), upper
secondary education (lower and upper Form VI), and higher education. Recently
on the advice of Unesco and the Bank, the Government has decided to restruc-
ture secondary education by dividing it into three cycles. Forms I to III
will constitute junior secondary education, Forms IV and V senior secondary
education, and Form VI (lower and upper) pre-university education. The
new structure will be introduced in 1980, when a new national examination is
to be administered for the first time to the students completing Form III.
The Government aims at the provision of nine years of education to all those
who wish to attend school by the early 1980s. This also implies extending
public education from the primary level where it now predominates, to the
first three years of secondary education.
2.07      With primary school enrollment of over 131,400 in 1977, the gross
enrollment ratio is estimated at 102%. Over 90% of primary school students
find places in government schools. There are many repeaters. If the number
of students repeating the final year of Standard VI in 1977 (10,000) is
subtracted from the total primary school enrollment, the enrollment ratio is
about 94%. Practically, Mauritius has attained universal primary education.
Total primary enrollment reached its highest level in 1972 with 152,000 and
has been gradually decreasing since then as a result of Mauritius' remarkable
achievements in population control (para. 1.05). During the 1971-75 period,



- 13 -
290 new primary school classrooms were constructed to replace obsolete build-
ings and to provide new student places in the areas not sufficiently covered
by schools. The program is being carried out by DWC (paras. 1.06 and 2.33)
under MECA's general direction.
2.08      Based on the 1972 census, the Central Statistical Office prepared
data on the 6-11 age group population by district in 1976. Comparison of the
age group population with primary school enrollment is summarized below:
Percentage Distribution of Primary School Enrollment and
6-11 Age Group Population by District, 1976
Port  Plaines  Pample-  Riviere du                Grand            Black

Age Group   14.5   27.9        8.7       9.1    6.3    12.3  10.7        6.9     3.6   100.0
RI 1/       1.117  1.032    1.046      0.923  1.016   0.878 0.832   1.217   0.833   1.000
1/   RI (Representation Index) is derived by dividing the enrollment percentage by
the age group population percentage.
Overall, primary school opportunities are evenly distributed in relation to
the age group population with the highest RI of 1.217 in the Savanne District
and the lowest of 0.832 and 0.833 in the Grand Port and Black River Districts
respectively.
2.09      As a result of the introduction of free secondary education, the
intake in Form I was 21,000 in 1977 as compared to 16,000 in 1976. Total
secondary school enrollment including Form VI increased from 46,900 in 1971
to 79,600 in 1977. Total secondary school enrollment as a percentage of
the 12-19 age group population is estimated at 45% 1/. In 1977 the percent-
age of enrollment in the first three years of secondary education was about
68% of the 12-14 age group. Thus in quantitative terms Mauritius has already
gone a long way toward the achievement of nine-year basic education.
1/   The Government uses an 8-year span (12-19) to make some adjustment for
over-age students, although the actual duration of the secondary cycle
is 7 years. The enrollment ratio would be 51% if based on the 12-18
age group.



- 14 -
2.10      Opportunities to obtain secondary education in 1976 are distributed
by district as summarized below:
Percentage Distribution of Secondary School Enrollment and
12-19 Age Group Population by District, 1976
Port  Plaines  Pample-  Rivieredu                 Grand            Black
Louis Wilhems  mousses   Rempart  Moka  Flacq  Port   Savanne  River  Total
Enrollment  20.0   48.2        6.5        6.0    2.9      6.1   6.0      4.1     0.2   100.0
Age Group   15.9   30.2        8.5        8.4    5.8    11.4   9.9       6.7     3.1   100.0
RI          1.258  1.596    0.765      0.714  0.500   0.535 0.606   0.612   0.065   100.0
Because of internal migration some adjustments are necessary for the 1976
age group population estimates by district, which are calculated on the
basis of the 1972 census. Nonetheless, the above table reveals that sec-
ondary education opportunities are not evenly distributed. RIs range from
1.596 to 0.065. Districts such as Black River, Moka and Flacq are most
under-represented in secondary school opportunities (para 3.12).
2.11      Of 66,700 secondary school students in 1976, only 5% were enrolled
in government schools, 18% in aided schools of A-status 1/, 72% in aided
schools of B-status, and the remaining 5% in unaided schools. Only five of
the nine districts had either Government or A-status aided schools. While in
the Plaines Wilhems district about 34% of students were enrolled in Government
or A-status aided schools, all students in the Flacq district attended
B-status aided or unaided schools. Therefore, the distribution in terms
of the type of secondary schools also needs improvement.
2.12      The decisions to abolish tuition fees and to restructure sec-
ondary education so as to develop a nine-year basic education cycle (para.
2.06) have been taken by the Government essentially to improve equity and make
basic education more relevant and effective. Until January 1977, at the end
of primary education students were selected for entry into: (a) five-year
secondary schools; (b) four-year terminal lower secondary schools; or (c)
short occupational training courses. Only those having access to five-year
secondary schools could proceed toward professional training and/or higher
education. However, the five-year secondary schools were primarily "grammar
schools" with emphasis on languages and literacy subjects and those failing to
complete the full course and enter professional training were ill-adapted for
work in industry or commerce. Furthermore while only 5% of the secondary
1/   Private secondary schools are divided into two groups, A and B, according
to their status of recognition for the School Certificate examination.
Some unrecognized schools are allowed to operate, but without aid.



- 15 -
school students found places in good-quality government schools; the large
majority had to settle for poor-quality private schools mostly run on a
profit-making basis (para. 2.36). In addition, by and large, children from
high-income families entered good-quality five-year secondary schools while
those from lower-income groups found places only in poor-quality secondary
schools, lower secondary schools or occupational training. As indicated in
para. 2.06, the new structure, developed with the advice of Unesco and the
Bank, will be fully effective by 1980; by that time, there will be only one
type of junior secondary education after the completion of the primary educa-
tion course.
2.13      At present the sector is in a state of transition.  The first edu-
cation project assisted by the World Bank in Mauritius Loan 1033/Credit 501,
signed in July 1974 focussed on the provision of lower secondary schools and
laboratory and workshop centers in order to (a) provide manpower for the
growing industrial sector; (b) increase Government participation in the
secondary education sub-sector; and (c) improve opportunities for free educa-
tion for low-income groups. After some initial difficulties, physical
implementation of the project is proceeding satisfactorily with all major
civil works furniture and equipment contracts already awarded. Because of the
broad sectoral changes summarized above, the project's components need to be
modified to take account of the new situation (paras. 2.24 and 3.12-3.15).
Improving Education Quality
2.14      In recent years Mauritius has made considerable progress in terms
of the quantitative expansion of education. However, the low pass rate of the
Primary School Leaving Certificate (PSLC) examination and the declining pass
rates of the School Certificate (SC) and the Higher School Certificate (HSC)
examinations indicate that in the process of expansion, quality has suffered.
In primary education automatic promotion is enforced up to Standard VI and
dropouts are negligible, but only about a half of Standard VI students pass
the PSLC examination. Many repeat Standard VI several times; in 1976 about
37% of Standard VI students were repeaters. Those who pass the PSLC exam-
ination (about 17,500 in 1976) can take the Junior Scholarship Examination 1/
to qualify for 400 student places available in government secondary schools
of high standard. As explained above (para. 2.12), until 1976, government
secondary schools were not only of high quality but also free of tuition
fees. The severe competition to obtain a place in government secondary
schools resulted in a highly competitive situation in primary schools,
particularly during the final year when work at school was often reinforced
by private tuition at parents' expense. This situation favored students
from high income groups.
1/   From 1980 the Junior Scholarship Examination will be combined with
the PSLC examination.



- 16 -
2.15      The PSLC examination is prepared by MIE and consists of three
compulsory subjects (English, French and mathematics), and one voluntary
subject. The content of primary education is geared to the examination
requirements. Sixty percent of the primary school curriculum is devoted to
English, French and one Oriental language, 28% to mathematics, geography and
elementary science, and the rest to civics, physical education, music, etc.
MIE is now engaged in the development of a new curriculum and in the in-
service training of primary school teachers in its application. At the same
time, MIE is preparing a new primary school examination. All these efforts
are designed to contribute to the improvement of the content of primary
education.
2.16      In 1976 there were about 5,500 primary school teachers, 58% males
and 42% females. In terms of qualification and training, 66% were qualified
and trained, 25% trained as teachers but did not have SC qualification,
and 9% had a SC or equivalent but no teacher training. Overall, these figures
indicate that Mauritius has a relatively well-qualified teaching force and
given the declining primary school population no increase in the stock of
primary school teachers is needed except for replacement due to attrition.
Therefore the Government can place a greater emphasis than in the past on the
improvement of the teacher training program to implement the new and broader
primary school curriculum. The Primary Teacher Training College (PTTC) at
Beau Bassin requires a SC for entry to the two-year pre-service course. The
College also offers a one-year in-service training program. The present
capacity of 450 is to be expanded to 600 to cater for the in-service training
program (Annex 1, Table 4). In view of planned revisions of the primary
school curriculum, the present premises need to be improved; additional
facilities for practical subjects and modern teaching methods are also
required.
2.17      The content of secondary education too, is essentially geared to
the examination requirements. Instruction periods per week of the SC pro-
gram are forty of 40 minutes each. For the first two years the program is
common to all students. It consists of English, French, history, geography,
mathematics, religious instruction, physical education, music, handicrafts,
civics and general science. A choice is offered among Hindi, Urdu and Latin.
From the third year, two basic options, in arts and science respectively, are
offered by those schools adequately equipped for science. In most private
schools, only the arts option is available. The Forms IV and V program has a
common core consisting of English, French, geography, history and mathematics.
Arts students in some secondary schools take Latin and Greek for nine periods
a week, and science students take chemistry, physics, and biology also for
nine periods a week. The HSC program has 32 periods of instruction per week.
Two basic options in arts and science are available in those schools suit-
ably equipped.
2.18      The quality of secondary education presents two principal issues:
(a) unequal student performance between government and private schools; and
(b) a curriculum not fully geared to Mauritius' environment. In 1976, 84%
of government school students who sat for the SC examination passed, whereas
only 38% of private school students passed. One obvious reason for the high



- 17 -
pass rate of government school students is that the best students selected
through the Junior Scholarship examination attend government schools. As
indicated above, most students in government schools come from high-income
groups and their educational achievements are influenced by their social and
family background. In addition, government schools have better qualified
teachers and teaching facilities than private schools. Except for about 20
private schools, the majority of the other 100 or so private schools are
accommodated in rented facilities such as private houses and apartments
(including basements) which were not designed for educational purposes;
therefore they usually lack proper classrooms and other facilities such as
science laboratories and are often of inadequate and unacceptable standards.
2.19      In 1976 there were 2,135 secondary teachers of which 9% were in
government schools which shared 5% of total enrollment. Of the total teach-
ers 601 had a university degree or equivalent, 549 an HSC or equivalent, 871
a SC or equivalent and 114 other qualifications. While 85% of government
school teachers had graduated from universities, only 23% of private school
teachers had degrees and 45% had only a SC; in other terms, they were barely
qualified to teach in primary schools (para. 2.16).
2.20      Until recently, most secondary teachers received their training
abroad. One of the functions of MIE is to provide teacher training to solve
the unsatisfactory situation as to teacher qualifications of private secondary
schools. The first batch of trainees was enrolled in a three-year post-SC
course in 1976. Extensive new buildings with a capacity of 500 have been
almost completed; MIE plans to enroll 110 p.a. in the full-time pre-service
training program and to expand the part-time in-service training program to
enroll 230 p.a. MIE is also planning a degree course in education to be
started in 1979 in cooperation with the University of Mauritius.
2.21      In addition to the unequal quality between government and private
schools, secondary education is characterized by curriculum choices inappro-
priate to Mauritius' environment. As pointed out earlier (para. 2.17), the
present curriculum has the objective to prepare students for the SC exam-
ination which is prepared externally by the Overseas Cambridge Examination
Syndicate. Even though the Syndicate develops examinations in a large var-
iety of subjects and includes electives in several practical and prevoca-
tional subjects, because of the lack of physical facilities and trained
teachers students in most schools are prepared principally to choose lang-
uages and social studies as their main examination subjects. An analysis
of SC subject candidacy in recent years carried out by Unesco and Bank staff
shows a heavy preponderance of students studying languages and humanities
and relatively few in the sciences. For example, in 1976 there were over
13,000 candidates in both English and French, but only 1,680 in physics
and about 100 in metalwork and woodwork.
2.22      The Government has entrusted to MIE the role to "modernize" and
"Mauritianize" the existing curricula starting with the lowest cycle part
of secondary education, Forms I, II and III. "Modernization" means to em-
phasize science and practical subjects, and "Mauritianization" to use local



- 18 -
references and materials and adapt the syllabus content to the local environ-
ment. The curriculum for Forms I, II and III which will constitute junior
secondary education starting in 1980, includes five core subjects of English,
French, mathematics, social studies and integrated science - altogether
28 periods per week. Two subjects will then be chosen out of agriculture,
industrial arts, home economics, arts and crafts, commerce, music and dance
and one additional language - for a total of eight periods per week. Finally
four periods are allocated to health, physical and moral education, hobbies
and recreational activities or social and community service. Thus, the
revised curriculum devotes about 43% of teaching time to science and practical
subjects, whereas the present curriculum allocates less than 20% to these
subjects.
2.23      In 1976 MIE started a pilot study of the revised curriculum begin-
ning with Form I. About one-third (44) of the secondary schools participated
in the study. This was followed by a pilot study of Form II in 1977 and the
Form III curriculum will be tested in 1978. The tests have given satisfac-
tory results. By 1980 all students in junior secondary schools will use the
revised curriculum and a new Form III national examination will be introduced
(paras. 2.06 and 2.12).
2.24      The revised curriculum requires teaching aids and facilities which
are not available in most private secondary schools. An inventory of school
facilities carried out by the Government with methodological assistance from
Bank staff shows that of 112 existing private secondary schools, only 17
have facilities to teach industrial arts, home economics or commerce. Nine-
teen of 21 A-status schools and 52 of 75 B-status schools are equipped with
chemistry laboratories, but no non-recognized schools are. Fourteen A-
status and 15 B-status schools have physics laboratories but no non-recognized
schools have this type of facility. The World Bank assisted first education
project includes the establishment of six laboratory and workshop centers for
private school students, and of six lower secondary schools of four-year
duration with science laboratories and workshops. Construction of the centers
and schools is well advanced. However, for the reasons outlined in paras.
2.12 and 2.13, these centers and schools should be converted into three-year
junior secondary schools in order to correspond to the new structure of
education and permit the introduction of the new junior secondary education
curriculum on a large scale. In addition, if they were not converted into
junior secondary schools, there could be heavy social pressure on the Govern-
ment to extend four-year lower secondary schools by one more year and make
them five-year secondary schools. Such a policy would be wasteful because the
labor market is not likely to be able to absorb a greater number of Form V
school leavers (para. 1.14) than that produced at present. In addition the
capacity of these 12 institutions needs to be expanded in order to accommodate
a large number of students who are currently enrolled in poor quality private
schools, and extend public education gradually until it caters for the bulk of
basic education enrollment (para. 2.07).
Meeting Manpower Requirements
2.25      One of the main objectives of the education sector is to produce the
manpower for the country's development (para. 2.01). The effort to modernize



- 19 -
the curricula is directed to this objective. The revised secondary school
curriculum aims at producing entrants to the labor market with basic educa-
tional attainment in language, mathematics, science, industrial arts and
commerce, on which to build experience and on-the-job training in the increas-
ingly industrializing society.
2.26      During the next ten years the annual manpower requirements in quan-
titative terms will be on the order of 8.600 primary school leavers, 5,000
junior secondary school leavers, 3,200 SC or equivalent, 400 HSC or equiva-
lent and 900 degree or diploma holders. It is expected that few primary
school leavers will enter the labor market as virtually all will proceed
to secondary school after education has become free of tuition fees. This
development increases the need for junior secondary school leavers to about
13,000 p.a. Approximately 6,800 junior secondary school leavers, 2,200 SC
holders and 1,300 HSC holders are needed to enter the next steps of the
educational ladder.
2.27      In the 1980's there will be an average annual output of about
19,500 (including dropouts) from junior secondary education (Annex 1, Table
5). All could be absorbed either in the labor market or in the next level of
the education system. As for Form V school leavers, if as in recent years all
those completing Form III have access to Form IV and the pass rate of the
JC examination increases from 40% in the mid-1970s to 65% in the mid-1980s,
about 12,000 p.a. will graduate at the SC examination as against an esti-
mated requirement of 5,400 p.a. Thus, as a part of the reorganization of
the sector the progression rate from Form III to Form IV needs to be greatly
reduced. Such is the purpose of the national examination to be administered
at the end of junior secondary education (para. 2.06). If about 70% of Form
III students pass the new national examination to be in-troduced in 1980 and
only 80% of those passing it enter Form IV, intake and output of Forms IV
and V will be approximately in balance with the existing senior secondary
school capacity as well as with labor market needs.
2.28      The University of Mauritius produces 500 to 600 graduates p.a.
In addition, the Government sends about 400 students p.a. for study overseas.
It is estimated that more than 1,000 students p.a. pursue higher education
abroad by their own arrangements. Thus, Mauritius is expected to be able
to meet manpower needs at the degree and diploma levels without difficulties.
The University of Mauritius has a practical approach to course development.
University representatives hold regular meetings with representatives of other
academic institutions, Government agencies and industry to determine their
specific needs for trained manpower. According to the needs the Univer-
sity enrolls students in specific areas. If the University has no faculty
available in an area requested, it can usually depend upon the industry to
assist in the instruction. The courses offered are related to agriculture,
industrial technology and public administration. For more specialized areas,
students go abroad.
2.29      In addition to the programs at the University of Mauritius there
are a variety of. occupational training programs available for primary and



- 20 -
secondary school :Leavers (Annex 1, Table 8). Each year 3,000 school leavers
participate in these programs. The programs are particularly suited for
training 14-15 year old youths preceding their entry to the labor market after
following the revised junior secondary course with emphasis on practical
subjects.
2.30      Among the occupational training institutions, the Industrial Trade
Training Center (ITTC) at Beau Bassin with a 280 student capacity is the
main source of industrial skilled workers. ITTC was established under a
UNDP/ILO project in 1968. It offers courses in seven trades including machine
shop, plumbing, welding, electrical installation, carpentry and joinery. A
second ITTC will open at Piton in 1978 with assistance under the first World
Bank education project. The new Center will have a 200 student capacity, and
will offer courses such as sheetmetal work, cabinet-making, and upholstery
which the existing ITTC does not give. MECA also runs five handicraft train-
ing centers; these train the unemployed or underemployed in rural areas in
producing consumer goods for the local market and souvenirs for tourists.
Further assistance to the development of handicraft training has been received
recently from the European Development Fund. The Development Works Corpora-
tion (DWC) offers supervisory and production training courses to its employ-
ees with assistance from France and India. Various specialized programs are
offered by other bodies. For example the Ministry of Labor operates a Sea
Training School, the Ministry of External Affairs, Emigration and Tourism
operates a Hotel and Catering School, the Ministry of Health runs a School
of Nursing, and the Central Electricity Board has its own Training Center.
2.31      In view of the Government policy of full employment with an increas-
ing emphasis on the industrial sector, one of the most important functions
of the education sector is to train personnel for commerce and industry.
Because of the vital role of this sub-sector, training activities now being
operated by Government agencies and private commercial and industrial firms
should be coordinated, and their future expansion planned. Job classifica-
tion, trade testing, and apprenticeship training are yet to be fully devel-
oped. The Government holds the view that the output from occupational train-
ing facilities is numerically but not qualitatively and structurally ade-
quate. The establishment of an institution to handle these problems is urgent
because, among other things, the changes underway regarding the structure
and the content of general education would provide candidates for entry into
occupational training with a background more suitable than that of the candi-
dates of the past (paras. 3.16 and 3.19).
Financing and Cost of Education
2.32      The annual capital expenditure of MECA varied from 2% to about 4% of
the total Government capital expenditure between 1973/74 and 1976/77. During
the same period the total amount spent by MECA was Rs. 50.0 million or about
3.3% of the total Government capital expenditure for the period. Within
MECA a large proportion (70%) of the capital budget available between 1973/74
and 1976/77 was spent on the construction of the Mahatma Gandhi Institute
(MGI) and the Mauritius Institute of Education (MIE).



- 21 -
2.33      On the other hand, the percentages of allocation to primary and
secondary education were only 0.7% and 1.2% respectively. The small alloca-
tion to primary education needs explanation. In fact, the Ministry for
Employment and not MECA is responsible for primary school construction.
'...LUgh the Ministry for Employment, the Government spent about Rs. 30 mil-
lion between 1973/74 and 1976/77 for primary school construction. This sum
is equivalent to 65% of MECA capital expenditure during the same period. If
this expenditure is added to MECA capital expenditure, education share in
total Government capital expenditure was 5.5% rather than 3.3% during 1973-
1977. This is in line with the ratios reported in countries at a similar
level of development and represents a reasonable proportion.
2.34      Educational institutions other than primary schools are usually
financed from external sources. The European Development Fund is assisting
two secondary schools at Rose Belle and Ebene and the extension to the Uni-
versiLty of Mauritius. The first education project of the World Bank will
make a major contribution to the secondary education sub-sector. It is
estimated that of the total Government capital investment for the 1977/78-
1979,/80 period, nearly 9% will be channelled through MECA. About 80% of the
MECA investment program would be financed through World Bank assisted projects.
2.35      Between 1973/74 and 1976/77 recurrent expenditure of MECA increased
at about 48% p.a. in monetary terms. In comparison, during the same period
the total Government recurrent expenditure increased at about 33% p.a. in
monelary terms. The MECA recurrent expenditure as a proportion of total
Government expenditures was 12% in 1975/76, and grew to 15% in 1976/77 and to
18% iLn the 1977/78 budget. The rapid increase in MECA's recurrent expenditure
has been caused mainly by increased Government assistance to private secondary
schools culminating in the introduction of free education in January 1977.
The percentage of expenditure allocated to private secondary schools grew from
3% of MECA budget in 1973/74 to 20% in 1976/77 when the Government greatly
extenided its aid to private schools and later announced free education.
However, the full impact of free education is felt in the 1977/78 budget in
which MECA allocates 29% of its recurrent expenditure to private secondary
schools. This allocation is to cover tuition fees which average about Rs. 5
million per month and grants-in-aid which averages about Rs. 1.5 million per
month. Grants-in-aid pay 70% of basic salaries of teachers. The number of
teachers on which the grants-in-aid are computed is based on the student
population of each school. MECA assistance to private secondary schools is
channeled through the Private Secondary Schools Authority (PSSA) which was
established in 1976 as a parastatal agency.
2.36      PSSA is headed by a Director who reports directly to the Minister
of Ecducation; under the Director there are sections of administration, fi-
nance and inspectorate. PSSA should inspect each school twice a month on
the basis of the 1971 regulations concerning private secondary schools.
PSSA has the power to close down a school which does not comply with the
regulations on standards of physical facilities and teaching quality. How-
ever, PSSA has no control over the budgeting and the expenditures of private
schools. As a result, it is not possible to determine the amount of profits



- 22 -
made by most private schools. Draft regulations on the budgeting of and
financial control over private schools have been prepared by the PSSA and
approved by the Interministerial Committee on Free Education. The regulations
have been reviewed by the Bank staff and found satisfactory. Agreement was
reached with the Government that the regulations will be introduced by January 1,
1979.
2.37      Another significant feature of MECA budget has been the declining
proportion of primary education expenditure in recent years. It fell from
67% of the education budget in 1973/74 to 62% in 1976/77 and is expected
to fall further to 40% in 1977/78. The main reason for this drop is the
decline in the absolute number of primary school students rather than a
reduction in the cost per student. Recurrent expenditure per primary school
student in fact increased from Rs. 272 in 1973/74 to Rs. 536 in 1975/76
at current prices, or to about Rs. 297 at 1973 prices.
2.38      Recurrent cost to the Government per secondary school student
differs significantly between government schools and private aided-schools.
But, the unit cost in private schools is growing rapidly. It increased from
Rs. 200 in 1973/74 to Rs. 641 in 1976/77 and is expected to be Rs. 912 in
1977/78, or by 4.5 times in four years. The unit cost of Government schools
grew by about 2.5 times from Rs. 1,299 in 1973/74 to Rs. 3,214 in 1976/77 but
decreased to Rs. 2,993 in 1977/78. As a result, the differential in the unit
costs to the Government between government and private secondary schools has
become smaller, from 6.5 times to 3 times. Since January 1977 all private
school costs are virtually financed by the Government. The difference be-
tween unit recurrent costs in government and private schools can be mostly
attributed to differences in qualifications of teachers (para. 2.19) and in
the amounts spent for teaching materials.
2.39      Combined total capital and recurrent expenditure of MECA was Rs.
797.7 million in 1973/74, Rs. 1,724.5 million in 1976/77 and is estimated
at Rs. 1,892.1 million for 1977/78. Of the total Government capital and
recurrent expenditure, education accounted for 8.3% in 1973/74, 12.1% in
1976/77 and 14.4% in 1977/78. As a share of GNP at factor cost, government
education expenditures were 3.9% and 4.6% in 1973/74 and in 1975/76 respec-
tively. Until recently, the share of Government expenditure on education
was comparatively small because a large part of the education system was
privately financed. But it has grown at a very rapid rate over the last
two years primarily because of the abolition of tuition fees. In light of the
current difficult financial situation of Mauritius, the Government set up the
Public Expenditure Management Committee in 1976 to examine which expenditure
items can be reduced. The committee hopes to reduce the overall budget by 10%
and expects that in the future total recurrent expenditure will be allowed to
grow at par with the growth rate of GDP, which is at present projected at 5%
p.a. in real terms in comparison to the original plan target of 6.5% p.a.
2.40      The future share of MECA recurrent expediture in total Government
recurrent expenditure depends upon various sets of assumptions. If it is
assumed that for the 1976-87 period real GDP will increase at an average



- 23 -
rates of 6% p.a. and the ratio of total Government recurrent expenditure to
GDP will remain at about 30%, the proportion of MECA recurrent expenditure
in 1987/88 can be calculated at 23% or 20% depending on whether secondary
school enrollment is estimated on the basis of the recent trend or the num-
bers required purely to meet labor market needs. If the ratio of total Gov-
ernment expenditure to GDP is 27%, the share of MECA on the total recurrent
budget will increase to 25% or 22% depending on enrollment growth in post-
junior secondary education. If, as it seems more likely, real GDP grows at
an average rate of 5% p.a. and the ratio of total Government recurrent ex-
penditure to GDP is 30%, the share of MECA in total recurrent expenditure
wilL be between 25% or 22% depending upon enrollment expansion. But if the
ratio of total Government recurrent expenditure to GDP is 27%, the MECA's
share of the budget will be between 28% and 24%. These possible develop-
ments are summarized in the table on the following page.
2.41      In short, education will absorb between 20% and 28% of the recur-
rent budget depending on the rate of economic growth, the rate of taxation
and the Government's ability to control enrollment growth after the junior
secondary course. It is likely that neither of the two extremes of the
projection will materialize and that the proportion of education expendi-
ture in the recurrent budget will be around 23% in the mid-1980's. By then
the impact of the elimination of tuition fees and the decline in population
growth rates in the late 1960's and the early 1970's would have been fully
incorporated into the system. To reduce the impact of the increasing cost
of education on the budget, the schools assisted under the project will
operate on a double shift system. Another potential cost saving measure
would be to increase the present student:teacher ratios of 25:1 in primary
and secondary education and this is being examined by the Government. It is
unl:ikely that, in the short term, these savings would be significant as (a)
primary schools in Mauritius can only accomodate a maximum of 35 students per
classroom, (b) the number of primary school pupils has decreased in recent
years as result of successful family planning policies and a corresponding
reduction of the teaching force can only be achieved by attrition because
teachers are public servants with tenure rights, and (c) seven oriental
languages are taught and require specialist teachers. Class sizes are vari-
able and are generally smaller than average. The Government plans to appoint
a high-level committee in April 1978 to undertake a comprehensive review of
the problems including the question of student:teacher ratios. The commit-
tee will complete its review by the end of 1978, and the Government will
discuss the committee's findings with the Bank.  An assurance was obtained
that by December 31, 1978 the Government would furnish the Bank with a report
on primary and secondary education policy (para. 5.05) including a statement
indiLcating the overall financial implications of such a policy and targets for
student:teacher ratios. The Government also agreed to prepare and forward
to the Bank for discussion, an annual report on the development and implemen-
tation of its education policy.

III. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      In response to the objectives for the education sector set forth
in the Five-Year Plan for Social and Economic Development (para. 2.01), the
proposed project would assist an investment program comprising the following
items:
Oblectives                      Items                    Specific Assistance

In addition, the proposed project would include the cost of architectural
and engineering services, and project implementation and evaluation.
Project Items
3.02      Reorganization of MECA.  The rapid growth and diversification of
the sector has heightened the Government's awareness of shortcomings and
inefficiencies of MECA. In addition, the office premises of the Ministry
are spread out in eight localities in and around Port Louis, the capital of



- 26 -
Mauritius (para. 2.03), which, to a great extent, causes problems in inter-
departmental comimunication and coordination. To improve administrative
efficiency and technical capacity of MECA (paras. 2.04 and 2.05), the proposed
project would help the Government reorganize the Ministry by providing:
(a) technical assistance comprising 60 man-months of specialist services and
48 man-months of' fellowships in a two-phased program; and (b) building,
furniture and equipment for a reorganized Ministry. The building would be
constructed on a site in Port Louis that is satisfactory and which is already
vested with MECA.
3.03      A management consulting firm of appropriate qualifications and
experience would be employed on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank to
carry out a reorganization study. Preliminary terms of reference and a work
program have been developed by the government; these documents which include a
detailed articulation of the expected outputs, will be further refined during
the negotiations between the government and the consultants. For the first
phase, 10 man-months of specialist services would be provided. The team would
consist of a management specialist, a systems analyst and a personnel analyst
in addition to a coordinator. With the participation of Mauritian staff, the
internationally recruited specialists would prepare a preliminary design of
the reorganization of MECA with necessary explanatory documentation, which
should be agreed with high level Government officials. Only after this
agreement, would the second phase of the study be implemented. The second
phase would last one year, during which internationally recruited specialists
would assist Mauritian officials in the implementation of agreed reorganization
proposals. TechLnical assistance for the second phase would include 50 man-
months of specialist services in management, personnel, systems analysis and
education and 48 man-months of fellowships in management for potential manage-
ment personnel. The completion of the first phase of the study satisfactory
to the World Bank and evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, that the Government
has taken all necessary actions to implement the proposals, will be conditions
of disbursement against civil works, equipment and furniture contracts for the
new MECA building.  In addition, the Government agreed to establish an educa-
tional planning unit within MECA by not later than December 31, 1978 and that
such a unit will be headed by an educational planner with qualifications and
experience satisfactory to the Bank.
3.04      Improvement of the Primary Teachers' Training College.  The Primary
Teachers' Training College (PTTC) in Beau Bassin, with a capacity of 450
trainees, is the only primary teacher training institution in the country
(para. 2.15). F'rojections of primary school teacher requirements show that
PTTC will be able to produce a sufficient number of teachers for the next ten
years. However, in-service training is needed for most teachers presently in
service. Many cf the 5,500 teachers in service attended the PTTC when a
School Certificate was not an entry qualification to the College as it is now.
Teachers must also become familiar with new teaching methods and audio-visual
teaching aids as a means to improve the quality of primary education. At
present teacher training is heavily language-oriented, as is primary education,
and laboratory and workshop facilities of the PTTC are poor. Facilities for
teaching modern educational methodology and technology do not exist except for
a language laboratory.



- 27 -
3.05i     The proposed project would provide:  (a) physical and social science
rooms and laboratories, micro-teaching units, arts and crafts workshops, a
home economics room, a media and resource center with audio-visual aids lab-
oratory and workshop, and administrative areas; and (b) technical assistance
comprising 36 man-months of specialist services and 72 man-months of fellow-
ships in the fields of micro-teaching, and audio-visual aids maintenance and
repair. The provision of these facilities would not only improve the quality
of instruction at PTTC but would also increase the PTTC's capacity from 450
to 600. The increase would enable the College to enroll 300 trainees p.a.
in the one-year upgrading or retraining program as well as 150 new trainees
p.a. in the regular two-year program to compensate for annual attrition.
3.06      Agreement was reached with the Government that starting in 1980 the
ratio of trainees in the general purpose course to those in Oriental languages
course will be five to one according to the ratio of comparable teaching hours
in the curriculum, and that trainees will be selected on the basis of merit
and qualifications rather than of sex. Existing regulations require that two
male student teachers be enrolled for every female student teacher. Procure-
ment of equipment for micro-teaching units as well as other audio-visual
equipment would be coordinated with the Audio-Visual Center (para. 3.09) and
the Mauritius Institute of Education (MIE) for future interchangeability and
cooperation in maintenance and repair.
3.07      Improvement of MECA's Audio-Visual Center.  The Center is respon-
sible for the production of educational radio and television programs for
primary schools and for maintenance and repair of radio equipment in all
schools. The Center uses the premises in three different locations, all
of which are inadequate and of poor standard. The revised curricula for
secondary and primary education would use radio and television broadcast-
ing as an integral part of teaching especially in those areas where visual
presentation is particularly important (e.g., sciences). This plan would
require the Center to play a greater role than at present. It is impractical
to expand or improve the activities of the Center in its presently scattered
locations.
3.08      The proposed project would assist educational radio and television
programs by providing: (a) new facilities for the Center of 1,200 m area
including audio and television studios, production rooms and workshops for
audio-visual support materials, and a printing section with storage rooms;
(b) equipment and furniture for different sections; and (c) technical assis-
tance comprising 24 man-months of specialist services in media service man-
agement and 135 man-months of fellowships in the production of radio and
television programs and in maintenance and repair of equipment. The Center
would also include facilities for the MIE printing section which would be
utilized also by MECA.
3.09      The new Audio-Visual Center would work closely with MIE, which is
responsible for curriculum development. Equipment and special rooms (e.g.,
studios) exist at MIE for teacher training purposes and a carefully monitored
build-up of the new technical facilities using the same system and with full



- 28 -
interchangeability would facilitate maintenance and repair and increase the
usefulness of both institutions. The Center will remain administratively
under MECA and be located in the vicinity of the MIE.
3.10      Development of the HIE.  The Institute has been assisted by UNDP
with Unesco as the executing agency but with the financial restrictions
imposed on UNDP, this assistance was curtailed in 1976 by nearly 50%. The
teacher training and curriculum development programs for secondary education
are the main activities of MIE both of which need strong support. For the
development and preparation of local examinations (paras. 2.15 and 2.21-2.23)
the MIE needs assistance especially in the area of printing and secure storage
of examination papers. Due to the expansion of MIE and the increased enroll-
ment of teacher trainees the present library facilities are no longer adequate.
3.11      The proposed project would assist MIE by providing:  (a) equipment
for the printing section and the Audio-Visual Unit and Resources Center; (b)
library equipment and book requirement for a four-year period; and (c) tech-
nical assistance of 150 man-months of fellowships. The facilities for print-
ing would be used by MIE and the Audio-Visual Center (para. 3.09). The fel-
lowships will be distributed over 17 different subject areas with emphasis
given to practical subjects in the new diversified curriculum. The supply
of audio-visual equipment to MIE and the Audio-Visual Center would be coor-
dinated for interchangeability and ease of maintenance and repair (para.
3.06).
3.12      Junior Secondary Schools.  Mauritius has attained universal six-
year primary education and now aims at the development of a nine-year basic
education course. Of greatest concern to the Government is the large number
of private, profit-making secondary schools, teaching a narrow curriculum in
unsuitable premises with many unqualified teachers (paras. 2.22-2.24).  Most
of the private schools lack laboratories and workshops and are unable to in-
troduce the new curriculum. PSSA has not so far been able effectively to
control and audit the increasing expenditures or to inspect school premises
and close down those which are unsuitable. The Government plans to offer
alternative accommodations in government schools with an appropriate standard
to give students better opportunities to benefit from the new and more prac-
tical curriculum and to extend basic education from six to nine years to
be offered primarily in government schools. These schools and centers are
spread throughout all of the nine districts in the country including those
most underrepresented in secondary enrollment such as Black-River, Moka and
Flacq (para 2.10).
3.13      The proposed project would assist these objectives by providing
additional 9,120 student places in junior secondary schools (Annex 1, Table
7). These student places would be created by converting, with expanded
capacity, three existing four-year junior technical schools, six four-year
lower secondary schools, and six laboratory and workshop centers into three-
year junior secondary schools (paras. 2.13 and 2.14).



- 29 -
3.14      To maximize equity at the critical junior secondary level, the
proposed project would expand the capacity of junior technical and lower
secondary schools to become eight-stream schools (i.e., schools with a capac-
ity of 960 each) with coeducational facilities from three-stream four-year
schools (i.e., a 480 capacity school). As for the six centers, three of
them would be expanded to eight-stream schools and another three to six-
stream schools because of limited land availability. Out of a total 9,120
new student places, 5,400, or about 60% will be for girls and will help
redress previous inequities in enrollment.
3.15      The impact of this expansion on junior secondary education effi-
ciency, opportunities and quality would be significant. Firstly, unit capi-
tal and recurrent cost would be reduced. The capital cost per student place
for expanding the 15 schools is calculated at 85% of the cost for building
new schools to accommodate the same number of students. The recurrent cost
per student is calculated at Rs. 1,590 for an eight-stream against Rs. 2,400
for a three-stream school; thus efficiency would be greater using the eight-
stream schools. With double-shifting the unit recurrent cost would fall
to Rs. 1,450 and Rs. 2,150 respectively. Secondly, the additional student
places created by the proposed project, 9,120, would increase the number of
places in government schools to a total of 16,680. This would account for
29% of projected total junior secondary enrollment in 1982, as compared
to 13% before the proposed project. With the existing 21 comparatively
good-standard private schools, the percentage of students in government
and those private schools would increase to 43% of total enrollment in 1982.
With the introduction of a double-shift system the proportion of students in
schools with good-facilities would increase to about 70%. Assurances were
obtained from the Government that: (a) the new junior secondary school
curriculum will be introduced in all schools and a national examination at the
end of the junior secondary cycle will be held starting in 1980; and (b) the
junior secondary schools assisted by the project will be utilized on a double-
shift basis in order to maximize their utilization. By Cabinet memoranda of
October 19 and November 2, 1977, the Government approved the structure of
education, established that entrance into Form IV would be based upon perform-
ance at the national examination to be administered at the end of Form III,
and stipulated that all government secondary schools would be operated on a
double shift basis.
3.16      Central Training Office.  To help attain full employment (paras.
2.30 and 2.31), it is essential to monitor closely the needs for occupational
training, which may change from year to year. The type of occupational train-
ing required may vary from that extending over a few weeks to three-year
apprenticeship programs. As the 1975-80 Plan proposes, it is necessary to
establish an organization to coordinate existing training programs sponsored
by various Ministries and agencies and to initiate new programs if necessary.
3.17      The proposed project would assist the establishment of a Central
Training Office by providing technical assistance in two phases for a total
of 72 man-months of specialist services and 60 man-months of fellowships.
Specialist services and fellowships would be provided in the areas of indus-
trial training, job classification, trade testing and certification, super-
visory training and handicrafts. The first phase of the study (12 man-months



- 30 -
of specialist services in the organization of occupational training) would
examine alternative arrangements for the organizational structure for the
Central Training Office, and define the functions, the composition of the
Governing Board and the staffing needs of the Secretariat. Among other
things, proposals would be formulated for providing a continuous review of
employment opportunities and the specialist(s) would assist the Government
in drafting the legislation required to establish the Office. The second
phase would assist in developing the Office and would include 24 man-months
of specialist services in job classification and the design of minimum train-
ing needs, 12 man-months of specialist services in trade testing and certifi-
cation, 12 man-months of specialist services in apprenticeship and in-plant
training, 6 man-months of specialist services in supervisory training, and
6 man-months of specialist services in handicrafts training.
3.18      Project Evaluation.  Assurances were obtained that the Government
would prepare and furnish to the Bank, promptly after completion of the
proposed project but in any event not later than June 30, 1982 (three months
after project completion), a report on the execution and initial operations of
the proposed project, its costs and the benefits derived or to be derived from
it, the performance by the government and the Bank of their respective obliga-
tions under the Loan Agreement, and the accomplishment of the purpose of the
Loan. The report would be prepared by the Program Implementation Unit of MECA
which would coordinate inputs from the various branches of the Ministry and
MIE. General activities of MIE include evaluation of educational issues. In
particular, its Evaluation Unit of the Department of Curriculum Research and
Development could assist in the preparation of the completion report.

Bank and for other similar projects. The March 1978 base building costs for
the junior secondary schools are estimated at US$320 per square meter; this
compares with a cost of $335 equivalent in Zambia (Lusaka - December 1976)
and $300 equivalent in Madagascar (Antananarivo - October 1977). Cost of
buildings in Mauritius reflect the additional safety measures necessary for
protection against periodic cyclones.
4.03      Custom Duties and Taxes.  In line with Mauritian policies and
practices, items imported directly for the project by the Program Implemen-
tation Unit (PIU) would be exempted from customs duties and taxes. Reimburse-
ment percentages have been calculated to exclude duties and taxes on construc-
tion and on limited amounts of local off-the-shelf purchases of furniture and
equipment. These duties and taxes are estimated at US$1.4 million equivalent.
4.04      Contingency Allowances.  For physical increases, 5% has been added
to the base cost of construction, furniture and equipment and architectural/
engineering services. Estimated price increases are based upon the applica-
tion of the following annual percentage rates of price escalation from the
base cost date (March 1978) in accordance with the implementation schedule
(Annex 1, Chart 4).

4.05      Foreign Exchange Component.  The foreign exchange component of
US$15.2 million equivalent has been calculated by Bank staff as follows:
(a) construction 57%; (b) furniture 65%; (c) equipment and technical assis-
tance 90%; (d) professional services 50%; (e) project administration 45%;
and (f) project evaluation 80%. The foreign exchange component reflects
the sizeable technical assistance and equipment component of the project
and the fact that most building materials are imported.
Financial Plan
4.06      A loan of US$15.2 million equivalent would represent 60% of the
total project cost of US$25.2 million including taxes or 64% of the project
cost net of taxes. It would meet all foreign exchange costs. The project
would be financed as follows:

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
5.01      Implementation.  The project would be implemented over a period of
about 4-1/2 years including 9 months for completion of payments and withdrawals.
The proposed Closing Date would be December 31, 1982.
5.02      The PIU, an administrative unit established within MECA for the
implementation of the first education project, would perform all administra-
tive functions for the second project. The Unit has functioned well and is
presently staffed on a full-time basis with a manager, architect, procurement
officer, accounting and other support staff. By December 31, 1978 a deputy
manager, with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank, will
be added full time to the Unit to assist with the expanded administrative
workload. The architect presently on secondment from the Development Works
Corporation would be replaced by an architect from the Ministry of Works (MOW)
who would be assigned to work full time with the PIU.
5.03      Architectural/Engineering Services.  Architectural and engineering
consultants, acceptable to the Bank that were appointed for the six laboratory
and workshop centers and the six lower secondary schools assisted by the first
education project have been retained by the Government to undertake the design
and supervision of the respective expansions and conversions of these insti-
tutions (paras. 2.13, 2.24 and 3.12-3.15) standard designs prepared for the
first education project will be used as far as possible in these expansions.
Architectural/engineering consultants would be appointed for the design and
supervision of the proposed new MECA administration building and the Audio-
visual Center. Consultants would be appointed on terms and conditions accept-
able to the Bank. MOW would be responsible for the design and supervision of
the construction of facilities for the Primary Teachers' Training College
(PTTC), and three junior secondary schools.
5.04      Site Selection.  The site for the proposed new building for MECA
is already owned by the Ministry and is suitable for development. The other
18 sites are all presently available. Although all these sites provide
sufficient land for the proposed physical expansion program, insufficient
space exists for adequate student recreation/sports facilities in the case
of five sites. This matter has been discussed with the Government which is
in the process of making arrangements for the teaching of physical education.
5.05      Building Industry.  The total value of construction in Mauritius was
estimated to be about 300 million rupees (US$45 million equivalent) in 1976.
The maximum annual value of construction of about 40 million rupees under the
proposed project would represent 13% of the 1976 output of buildings and would
not present any significant construction problems, as sufficient capacity
exists.
5.06      In the early to mid-1970's, Mauritius experienced a substantial
increase in the demand for construction services. The local construction
industry, consisting mainly of a few long established firms, was unable to



- 35 -
fully respond due to a lack of equipment, skilled workers and shortages of
essential imported construction materials. Construction costs increased
rapidly as demand greatly exceeded the capacity of the industry. Within the
past two to three years the capacity of the industry has increased as several
foreign contracting firms from Kenya, India and Reunion have been attracted to
the island. More efficient construction methods have been developed. Imports
of cement, steel and other basic materials now correspond to the demand,
consequently some measure of price stabilization has occurred. This was
evidenced in tenders received during 1977 for the first education project.
Construction works totalling about 60 million rupees were tendered in two
phases; bidding was keen. Eleven firms, including two from the neighboring
island of Reunion, responded to the invitation to bid and works are proceeding
satisfactorily.
5.07      Procurement and Disbursement.  Contracts for construction of the
administration building for MECA, the PTTC, the Audio-Visual Center, three
junior secondary schools and furniture and equipment for the project would be
awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with the World
Bank guidelines for procurement. The value of these contracts would be about
52% (US$11.0 million equivalent including contingencies) of the total value
of the physical facilities to be provided under the project. Exceptions to
these procedures would be for construction contracts costing less than $250,000
equivalent each, and for furniture and equipment contracts costing less than
$50,000 equivalent each. These contracts are unlikely to attract foreign
bidders and would be awarded after competitive bidding advertised locally in
accordance with local procedures acceptable to the Bank. The aggregate amount
of such contracts is not expected to exceed $500,000 equivalent.
5.08      Construction contracts for 12 junior secondary schools, represent-
ing 48% (US$10.2 million equivalent including contingencies) of the total cost
of physical facilities, would be concluded through extension of contracts with
contractors already on-site for the following reasons:
(a) Work is presently proceeding on all twelve sites and the
difficulties of site demarcation and contract delineation
would be virtually unmanageable due to the restricted
size of the sites and the nature of the work involved.
The proposed work includes extension of the buildings
under construction involving vertical and horizontal
expansion and in some cases changes of function that
necessitate structural and internal partition rearrange-
ments; and
(b) Time is of the essence to ensure completion which would
enable the Ministry of Education to commence limited
student intakes as planned at six redesigned laboratory
and workshop centers during the 1978 academic year, and
for a form I intake at a further six junior secondary
schools at the start of the 1979 academic year.
(c) Savings in cost would also result, as the contracts
would be based upon unit rates as contained in the



- 36 -
original bills of quantities for construction con-
tracts which were awarded in 1977 after international
competitive bidding.   Bidding was particularly keen
and all twelve contracts were awarded to local firms.
A standard fluctuation clause is included. If formal
retendering were required, considerable cost increases
could be expected and a delay of at least one year would
result in providing the facilities necessary to support
the nine-year basic education cycle. This would have
an advetrse effect on the education reform. Technical
details on the proposed modifications and expansions of
the existing schools are given in Annex 2.
5.09      Sketch designs, draft tender documents and master lists of furni-
ture and equipment, including proposed grouping, would be reviewed by the
Bank. Items would be grouped to the extent practicable to encourage compe-
titive bidding anid to permit bulk procurement. Review of tender evaluation
documents by the Bank prior to award would not be required for construction
contracts, each costing less than $250,000 and for furniture and equipment
contracts, each costing less than $50,000 equivalent.
5.10      Where Lnternational competitive bidding procedures are followed,
domestic manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a prefer-
ence of 15% or the existing rate of import duties whichever is lower, over
the c.i.f. price of competing suppliers.
5.11      Disbursement (Annex 1, Table 11) would be on the basis of:  (a) 55%
of total expenditures for construction, architectural and engineering services
and project adminaistration; (b) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly
imported furniture and equipment or 100% of the ex-factory cost, if locally
manufactured, or 75% of local expenditures if procured locally; and (c) 100%
of foreign expenditures for technical assistance, fellowships including project
evaluation. Disbursement for project administration would be made against
certificates of expenditure, documentation for which would not be submitted
for review but would be retained by the government, and would be available for
inspection by thie Bank during the course of project supervision. Expendi-
tures for project administration would be audited by a government appointed
auditor, satisfactory to the Bank, for each fiscal year, in accordance with
sound auditing principles. Copies will be provided to the Bank within four
months after the end of the fiscal year.
5.12      Retroactive reimbursement of a sum not exceeding US$200,000 equiv-
alent for approved expenditures incurred after December 1, 1977 and prior to
Loan signing is recommended for: (a) the services of consultant architects/
engineers for the design and supervision of project institutions; (b) tech-
nical assistance for the reorganization of MECA; and (c) construction works
at six junior secondary schools. This will permit a rapid start to the
project and enable the Government to meet the planned 1978 and 1979 opening
dates for twelve junior secondary schools (para. 5.08).
5.13      The project is expected to be completed by March 31, 1982 with a
proposed Loan Closing Date of December 31, 1982 including nine months for
completion of payments and withdrawals.

VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
6.01      The principal benefits of the proposed project would be related
to efficiency, equity, quality, manpower development and institution building.
6.02      Efficiency.  The proposed project would improve the efficiency of
junior secondary education. The investment required to expand schools from
three streams to eight streams would generate important savings to the Gov-
ernment (para. 3.15). Assuming that the life of the project will be 25 years,
these savings would have a present value of US$11 million equivalent if
discounted at 10%. The present discounted value of the investment required
to expand the schools from three streams to eight streams is US$9 million
equivalent.
6.03      Equity, Quality and Manpower Development.  The proposed project
would create an additional 9,120 student places in government junior secondary
schools. All project schools will be co-educational and will be located in all
nine districts of the country including those most under-represented in the
share of government school enrollment (para. 3.12). This addition would in-
crease the proportion of students in junior secondary schools with facilities
to offer the revised curriculum from 26% to 43%. With double-shifting in
government schools, the percentage would further increase to about 70%. The
greater share of enrollment in government junior secondary schools combined
with enrollment in good private schools would thus broaden the distribution of
educational opportunities with similar standards of physical facilities,
curricula and teachers (para. 3.15). The provision of physical facilities
necessary for the revised curriculum would also serve to produce youth with
the aptitudes and basic educational background required for on-the-job training
in industry (paras. 1.18, 2.22, 3.12). Finally the project would improve the
quality of primary and secondary education by improving teacher training and
audio-visual aids (paras. 3.05 and 3.08).
6.04      Institution Building.  Institution building would continue to be
an essential feature of World Bank assistance to the education sector in
Mauritius. The first education project helped establish an effective imple-
mentation machinery and strengthen vocational training with technical assis-
tance from India. The sector work conducted by the Bank and Unesco has
assisted the Government in making far-reaching changes in the structure
and content of education and these changes provide the basis for the pro-
posed second project. In addition, the project would strengthen the plan-
ning and implementation capacity of the Ministry of Education and Cultural
Affairs (paras. 2.02, 3.02), and help coordinate the provision of occupa-
tional training (paras. 1.19, 2.31, 3.16).
6.05      Risks.  The major risk associated with the proposed project relates
essentially to the junior secondary schools. The increased share of govern-
ment school enrollment would vacate about 50% of student places in private
secondary schools. Despite the proposed shift in education investment em-
phasis to promote nine-year basic education, there is a risk that these
places would be used to increase the number of senior secondary students



- 38 -
given the strong social pressure to obtain a School Certificate. Mauritius
does not need such expansion on purely manpower grounds, and furthermore
cannot afford it financially (para. 2.40). The Government confirmed that it
would control senior secondary education enrollment growth and to use the new
Form III examination, coupled with aptitude tests, in order to select candi-
dates for: (a) entry to Form IV (in line with expected high-and middle-level
manpower absorptive capacity); (b) occupational training; and (c) the labor
market. The Government also confirmed that in implementing this policy, it
intends to review gradually, estimates of requirements and supply of trained
manpower and to carry out tracer studies 1/. A number of cabinet memoranda have
been approved on these points but a comprehensive policy statement has not yet
been made. To minimize the risks, agreement was reached with the Government
that a report on primary and secondary education policy would be furnished to
the Bank by December 31, 1978, and annually thereafter a report on the imple-
mentation of this policy would be prepared for the Bank's review (para. 2.41).
6.06      In spite of the risk associated with the proposed project, it
would be an integral part of Mauritius' development strategy which is
directed toward creating the basic social and economic infrastructure and
incentives for the achievement of full employment.
1/   A tracer study is a method to systematically follow the progress of
graduates in the labor market.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Agreement was reached with the Government on the following prin-
cipal points:
(a) the introduction of (i) regulations on budgetary and financial
control of private secondary schools, (ii) a new junior secondary school
curriculum, (iii) a Form III national examination, and (iv) double shift
utilization of Bank assisted schools (paras 2.36 and 3.15);
(b) the establishment of an appropriately staffed education planning
unit within MECA, and the preparation of a completion report evaluating
the project (paras 3.03 and 3.18);
(c) procedures for the selection of applicants for the Primary
Teacher Training College (para. 3.06); and
(d) the preparation by the Government of a statement of its primary
and secondary education policy and annual reports on the implementation of
such policy (paras. 2.41 and 6.05).
7.02      In addition to the usual conditions, the completion of the first
phase of the reorganization study of MECA, in a form satisfactory to the Bank,
and evidence satisfactory to the Bank that all necessary actions have been
taken to implement the recommendations of the study, will be conditions
for disbursement against civil works, furniture and equipment contracts for
a new Ministry Building (para. 3.03).
7.03      Retroactive financing not exceeding US$200,000 equivalent is
recommended for (a) the services of architectural consultants, (b) technical
assistance for the reorganization of MECA, and (c) construction at six junior
secondary schools (para. 5.12).
7.04      The project is suitable as a basis for a loan of US$15.2 million
equivalent to Mauritius for a term of 17 years including grace period of 4
years.

SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
Laboratory and Workshop Center Modifications and Expansions
1.        The proposed changes in educational function from centralized lab-
oratory and workshop centers to general lower secondary schools Forms I-III,
entails numerous modifications to the buildings under construction, and addi-
tional buildings are required to support the planned enrollment increases.
2.        The modifications are principally the substitution of a number of
laboratories with classrooms; alterations to the home economics and workshop
facilities and changes in the workshop mezzanine structures; vertical expan-
sions to the laboratory-classroom blocks in the three rural centers; the pro-
vision of storage facilities, and alterations to the ablution blocks.  These
modifications can, at the present stage of construction, be easily incorpo-
rated into the buildings as construction progresses.
3.        Owing to the construction stage already reached on these sites,
immediate decisions were necessary during the time of appraisal and these
were taken by the Ministry of Education, at their own risk, to keep the sites
functioning normally whilst permitting further time (about two months) for
Bank review of the appraisal mission's findings. These decisions were con-
fined to the minimum actions necessary in each case and as far as possible
such changes that could be financed from contingencies presently included
in the contract amounts.
4.        For example in the case of the expansion at the Port Louis lab-
oratories and workshop center, the cramped nature of the site necessitated
a vertical extension to the workshop block. This in turn entailed redesign-
ing of columns and foundation bases and work was stopped by the MOW to incor-
porate the proposed modifications. As part of a general "time-buying" exer-
cise, instructions were issued to all contractors to hold completion of
specific building areas and finishes that would require to be demolished
or re-surfaced when final decisions were made on the nature and extent of
modifications and expansions. New facilities would consist of classrooms,
library, staff room and a multi-purpose hall at each site. If the Govern-
ment proceeds with the project at the maximum rate, it is expected that
retroactive financing of about US$180,000 sould be required for expenditures
on architeetural design, structural engineering and construction work ptior
to the projected April 1978 loan signing date.



ANNEX 2

Lower Secondary School Modifications and Expansions
i..        Contracts for construction of these six schools were awarded in
August 1977. Including site development, the cost as tendered was about
$4.2 million equivalent. It is proposed to double the enrollments in these
schools at an additional cost of about $4.9 million. As the present con-
tracts are scheduled to last for 22 months to July 1979, decisions concern-
ing the expansions prior to the anticipated April 1978 loan signing date were
not considered to be as critical as in the case of one of the other major
project components--the laboratory and workshop centers conversions and
expansions. At the Bank's recommendation, the architectural consultants
provided in site layouts, space for limited future expansions. However,
to permit incorporation of the expansions as appraised in this proposed
project, portions of the school complexes had to be slightly relocated on-
site. As vertical expansions of the laboratory and home economics blocks
are envisaged, the architectural/engineering consultants are currently making
the necessary modifications to their designs to permit the proposed expansions.
Because land in Mauritius is very expensive and scarce, these school sites are
small and the present proposals are for compact clusters of buildings of two,
three, and four storeys. As much of the proposed expansions will be inte-
grated in the form of vertical and link on extensions to these buildings,
the difficulties in job and site demarcation effectively preclude the use
of a different contractor in the event of retendering. The MOW technical
staff and the architectural and engineering consultants were of the opinion
that the proper course of action was to extend the contracts with the con-
tractors on-site on the basis of unit rates of cost as awarded contained in
the bills of quantities.
6.        The consultants are currently preparing proposals for the proposed
expansions. If design works proceed as rapidly as planned, actual reimburs-
able expenditures for professional fees prior to the anticipated April 1978
loan signing date are estimated at US$ 25,000 equivalent.
