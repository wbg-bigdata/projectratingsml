SECCND RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREP4CE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Water
Supply and Sanitation Project in Paraguay, for which Loan 2014-PA in the amount
of US$11.8 million was approved on June 16, 1981. The Loan was closed on June
30, 1989, four years behind schedule.   It was 991 disbursed and the last
disbursement was on March 20, 1990.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy
Operations Division (LA4IE) of the Latin America and the Caribbean Country
Department IV (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower
(Part II).
Preparation of this PCR began during the Bank's project supervision
missions of November 1989 and June 1990, and is based on the Staff Appraisal
Report; the Loan Agreement; supplementary letters; supervision reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

SECOND RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMNARY
Obj ectiveb
The Bank loan of US$11.8 million helped the Borrower to finance the Second
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project in rural communities in southern
Paraguay. Project objectives were to: construct about 49 rural water system to
benefit about 60,000 people by 1985; install individual waste disposal systems;
implement technical assistance to improve the managerial capacity of the project
executing agency, SENASA; and organize and develop the beneficiary communities
so they could build and operate the new systems (para. 3.01).
Imnleme_tation Exgerience
Project works were completed by the end of 1990, that is, five years behind
the appraisal estimate. The main reasons for delays in project execution weres
(a) weaknesses in the project executing agency's top management; (b) lack of
counterpart funding from the government due to fiscal constraints; (c) delays in
procurement approvals by government authorities; (d) temporary suspension of loan
disbursements on country grounds between mid-1984 and January 1987; and (e)
paralysis of works because of the change of government and the change in SENASA's
management. In addition, the level of Bank supervision after 1984 was
insufficient to assist the Government and SERASA effectively in resolving the
issues affecting project execution (paras. 5.01 and 8.01).
Results
Project objectives were met. The number of water systems built (51)
exceeded the project target (49).  In sanitation, the goal established for
sanitary units was fully met. Institutional objectives were also substantially
met: SENASA grew as a national organization responsible for the rural water
supply and sanitation sector; the beneficiary communities were organized and
trained to participate in the project and properly run their water and sanitation
systems. The health and environment of the coamunities were greatly Improved
under the project. Community participation in project financing was within the
parameters established in the Loan Agreement (par&. 6.01).
Sustainabilitv and Reolicabilitv
The project is likely to maintain an adequate level of benefits throughout
its economic life. A key factor is community participation in the operation and
maintenance of the water systems, and its willingness to implement tariff levels



iv
sufflciont to cover operating costs and debt service. The record so far is
encouraging.   The project impact, by building up SEMASA'  managerial and
technical capacity, also promises a high degree of continuity in sector
development (para. 7.01).
A significant rik for project sustainability l the financing and carrying
out of major repairs and replacement of equipment, particularly pumps, after 10
to 15 years of operation. This could be not only a costly undertaking but it
would also require the development of technically satisfactory alternatives.
SENASA will need to ensure that it is ablo to assirt the comunities in due time
both technically and financially (para. 7.02). The financial risk results from
the unsatisfactory Implementation of the fund for major repairs croated in SEKASA
(para. 6.06).
Despite the success of the project, it is clear that changes in sector
policies and practices should be explored to allow adequato project replicability
and faster improvements in service coverage. At present, only 5S of the rural
population, which accounts for 642 of the total population, has access to safe
wator supply. The revised policies should aim at further improving cost rocovery
and thus reducing government subsidies. This could be accomplished by a set of
measures that includess
(a)   seeking wider project replicability by a better matching of the
level of services provided and the population's ability and
willingness to pay. Consideration should be given to differential
service levels based on the comunity ability and willingness to
uake initial contributions to project inveatment and to service
their debtss and
(b) establishing terms and conditions for the subloans that ensure more
satisfactory cost recovery and transparency of the subsidies to the
communities (para. 7.03).
Findings and Lessons Learned
The main lesson from this project are the need to:
(')   build-in a suitable institutional mechanism to ensure that funds and
technology will be available for major system repairs; and
(b)   deal with procurement issues early in project preparation, and
promptly resolve problems which arise during project execution; and
c)    maintain adequate and timely supervision inputs throughout the
project life, regardless of any hiatus in disbursements (para.
8.02).

2.   Backround
2.01 The development of the water supply and sanitation sector in Paraguay is
the responsibility of the Government through two institutions: CORPOSANA for
urban centers, and SENASA for rural communities.1 In the early 1970a, water and
sanitation services in Paraguay were limited to the capital city, Asuncion, and
a few other cities; rural water supply and sanitation were at an early stage with
only 10 comunities around Asuncion served. Lack of sector development policies,
1ow level of investments. and weak institutional capacity were among the main
causes for the high deficit in rural services.
2.02 In the early 1980., Paraguay set objectives for the decade aiming at:
expanding water and sanitation services in urban and rural areas, strengthening
sector institutions, and implemonting cost recovery policiea. These objectives
were linked to broader objectives of improving socioeconomic conditions of set-
tlers and native families suffering from lack of water and sanitation in the
fast-developing agricultural frontier.
2.03 Government efforts to achieve these goals have raised water supply and
sanitation service levels to about 20X of the total population (still one of the
lowest in South America), of which the rural population shares a modest 51
coverage. The first Bank effort to assist the Government in the development of
water supply services in rural areas was Loan 1502-PA, approved by the Board in
December 1977. The project financed under this Loan was successfully completed
in 1985, supplying water services to 42 rural communities in three neighboring
1    SENASA was created in 1972 as a unit of the Ministry of Health to
develop water supply and sanitation systems in communities of up to
4,000 inhabitants.



-2-
provinces of Asuncion. The project provided technical assistance to compensate
for SENASA's scarce resources in engineering, project management, and operation
of water systems.
3. Poiect Qklectlives and Desgription
3.01   Prolect Ob1ectiveos   The main project objectives weres (a) providing
chlorinated water to 1002 (802 through house connections and 202 through
standpipes) of the 1985 population of 49 rural comunities; (b) promoting better
hygie.i  habits and contributing to public health improvement;  (c) further
strengthening SENASA'S managerial and operational capabilities; and (d) promoting
community self-reliance by contributing to the project capital investment and by
assuming full responsibility for system operation and maintenance.
3.02   Proiect Deseription:  The project consisted of: (a) construction of new
or extension of existing water supply systems in 49 rural communitioj; (b)
installation of about 2.000 sanitary unit2 and construction of about 2000
latrines; (c) procurement of equipment and tools for regional laboratories, for
well drilling operations, and for community repair shops; (d) procurement of
trucks for SERASA's construction supervision; (e) provision of health education
programs in the participating communities; and (f) provision of technical
assistance to SERASA in the areas of project management and operational and
financial administration.
4. Proiect Oriain and Oraanization
4.01   The project was conceived as a follow up to Loan 1502-PA to expand water
and sanitation serviceo in rural areas and further strengthen SENASA. The project
area included communities between 400 and 4,000 inhabitants in oeven rapidly
developing department. in southern Paraguay. An important project characteris-
tic was the continuation of a high level of community participation in project
preparation, execution, and financing.
4.02   The project was well designed and organized, and made appropriate use of
available resources. On the design and organizational side, the project
replicated an institutional arrangemnt (Juntas de Saneamiento) that had proved
highly effective in the execution of the first Bank-financed project (Loan 1502-
PA). These Juntas (sanitation committees) are legal entitiesa responsible for
promoting adequate health practices in their communities. The sanitation
committees joined efforts with SERASA to finance and construct the systems, but
remained responsible for their administration, operation, and maintenance. On the
technical side, the project introduced appropriate engineering designs and
standardization of materials, drawing also on the experience of the first rural
water supply and sanitation project.
2     Each unit consists of a shower, lavatory, and lea ndry facilities.
3     Alto Paran5, Itapus, Misiones, Caaguazu, Neembucu, Caazap5, and Guair5.
4     Law 369 of 12/01/72 and Decree 8910 of 09/10/74 creates and regulates
the Juntas.



-3-
4.03   The operational strategy was also wll conceived. SENASA's community
promotion focused on organizing the sanitation committeos and developing their
commitment to participate in the pr3ject from initial planning and financing to
the operation and maintenance of the systems. Moreover, the project included
substantial technical assistance to SENASA for strengthoning its managerial
capabilities and helping it to organize the communities and design simple
operation and maintenance procedures for the water systems.
- 04 Community participation in financing capital investments was considered
essential for the success of the project, in addition to providing a subsidy to
make the project affordable. Communities, based on affordability criteria, would
be required to provide a minimum of 22Z of the investment costt 101 in cash and
labor during the construction period, and the remait.der as a long-tron debt.'
Based on SEMASA's advice, the Juntas would then set tariffs to cover operaticn
and maintenance, debt service, aud their contribution to a fund for major repairs
and replacement of assets.
4.05   Project risks and the execution schedule were appropriately assessed. The
major project risk at appraisal was SENASA's weak implementation capacity, which
was to be improved by providing technical assistance. The foasibility of the
execution schedule was supported by tne experience under Loan 1502-PA which was
almost totally disbursed (88S by December 1981). Under these conditions, the
project should have proceeded as scheduled; however, issues beyond bENASA's
control intervened early in the implemntation process. The country's rapidly
deteriorating fiscal situation, which started in the early 1980s, after the end
of the hydroelectric boom of the previous decade, caused frequent delays in
project execution. The project was further delayed by lengthy contract approval
procedures (para. 5.03).
5. Proict Imploment*tion
5.01   Loan Effectiveness and Pro1ect Start-uo:   Project events up to Loan
signature occurred on schedule, but delays developed during subsequent stages.
Loan effectiveness took three months more than originally planned due to delays
in the appointment of consultants - which was a condition of effectiveness 
and overall project execution moved slowly during the first year.
5.02   Implemontation Schedule: Project works were completed by the end of 1990.
that is, flva years behind appraisal estimate. The main reasons for the long
delay in project *xecution weres (a) weaknesses in SENASA's top management; (b)
lack of counterpart funding from the government due to fiscal constraints; (c)
frequent delays in procurement approvals by government authorities; (d) temporary
suspension of loan disbursements on country grounds (foreign exchange rate
issues) between mid-1984 and January 19871 and (a) paralysis of works between May
and September 1989 because of the change of government and the subsequent change
in SERASA's management.6
5     Minimum requirements were: 51 in cash; 51 either in cash and/or labor;
and 121 as a debt over 15-20 years at 9.6S interest.
6     A new Director was appointed to SENASA on October 1. 1989.



-4-
5.03   Procure%gnp   Major causes of procurement dalays were: (a) frequent
discrepancies between local authorities and the Bank in the interpretation of
Bank procurment gr'delines when they wore in conflict with local regulations;
and (b) poor communications bcnween SENASA and the authorities at the Ministry
of Finance reoponsible for approving bid invitations and awards. Despite these
congtraints, procurement issues were satisfactorily resolved and procurement was
done following procedures acceptable to the Bank. Purchases of materials and
equipment, and contracts for civil works ware done under ICB; deep vell construc-
tion by SEMASA's force account: and pipe installation by community self-help.
5.04 Proiect Cost: The final project cost was US$16.65 million, as compared
with an estimated total cost of US$20.8 million (Part III SA). Both local and
foreign costs were below appraisal estimates. The local cost underrun largely
resulted from increased conmunity participation. Savingso in foreign costs were
due to the introduction of low-cost technologies and material standardization.
These sa-ings permitted SENASA to acquire more equipment and materials than
originally planned and to finance partially out of loan proceeds the local costs
of the construction of storage tanks (Part III, 5B).
5.05 Disbursements: After four extensions of the closing date up to June 30,
1989, total loan disbursements amounted to US$11.68 million (Part III. 3).
Disbursements against commitments were made until January 8, 1990, ane. an
outstanding balance of US$122,231 was cancelled.
5.06  Loan Allocation:  The categories of the Loan proceeds wore revised on
various occasions (Part III, 5B). An Important revision was made in 1983 when
savings were detected in foreign materials and interest during construction. As
a result of thil -evision a new category was introduced to allow the financing
of civil works      deep wells and sk'orage tanks. Other revisions responded to
adjustments in loan amounts allocated to different categories and extensions in
the final date for the capitalization of interest accrued during construction.
6. Proie!ct Results
6.01  2rgJoct Oblg ctivs:  Project objectives were met. On May 1990, 48 water
systems were functioning and three others were near completion. This exceeded
expectations as the project target was the construction of 49 systems. Population
served is expected to exceed the project target by about 55,000. The number of
standpipes wero substantially below appraisal estimtes due to comumity
preference for house connections (para. 7.03) -1.000 actual versus 12.000
estimatod at appraisal. Construction costs are istimated at $143.00 per capita
in current prices (the appraisal estimate was $130.00 at 1981 prices). In
sanitation. the goal established for sanitary units and latrines was fully mt.
The tochnical assistance to SEMASA upgraded staff performance in project
management and operations. The cmiunity promotion and health education program
was highly satisfactory both in promoting community participation in the project
and in developing awareness of the importance of hygicic practices and of
protecting water resources from contamination.
6.0'   SENASA Level of Performance: SENASA complied with the performance levels
specified in the supplementary letter to the Loan Agreement of July 15, 1981.
Since its inception, SENASA ha  financed 141 systms with 129 functioning and 12



-5-
still being constructed. These have bonefitted a population of 170.000 as of
October 1989, which exceeded original targets by 55,000 (Part III, 4).
6.03  Overall, SERASA's ataffing lndicators were also met.  However, staff
allocation for construction supervision and technical aasistance to communities
was poorly planned and frequently plagued by problems rosulting from lack of per
diem and transportation for engineers and social workers. As a consequence, the
quality of construction supervision was often poor.
6.04 SERASA, in its role as lending agency to the communities, foll behind in
billinL and colloction, maintaining excessively high accounts receivablo (7.5
months as of October 31. 1989).
6.05   Community participation in project financing woo within the parameters
established in the Loan Agreement. Cash end self-help contribution to direct
investment in the water systems amounted to an average of 182 (the covenanted
minimum was 101). Total contribution (cash and self-help plus long-tem debt)
ranged from a low of 182 to a high of 682 of the direct investment with a
weighted average of 502 (Annex 1), which is well above the minimum of 222
established in the Loan Agreement. This figure, however, overstates the extent
of community participation because: (a) it masks the high level of subsidy
resulting from en interest rate of 9.61 and a domestic annual inflation rates
ovcr 202 on average in the 1980's; and (b) it doos not take into account the
costs incurred by SENASA in project preparation, promotion and supervision, and
in the provision of technical assistance to the comunities. SENASA' a operational
and administrative expenditures are covored by the Government's budgetary
contributions (Annex 3).
6.06 The fund created in SENASA for major repairs of the water systems (para.
4.04) has not fulfilled the objectives established in the project design. In
fact, the purchasing power of these resources, which are entrusted by the
communities to SENASA, has been substantially reduced over the years sinco these
funtd have been deposited in the Central Bank in a non-interest-earnin& account.
The loan documents did not include any provision in this respect, and the
recomandations made by supervision mission to remedy the problem were not
attended by the Government and SNASA.
6.07 The Sanitation Committees have generally implemented tariffs sufficient to
cover operation and maintenance expenditures, their contribution to the fund for
major repairs, and the service of their dobts with SENCSA (Anne. 2).
7. Proect SustaLnabilitv and 1enlicabilitv
7.01 The project is likely to maintain an adequate level of bonefits throughout
its economic life. A key factor is community participation In system operation
end maintenance, including the implementation of tariffs sufficient to cover
operating costs and debt service. The record so far is encouraging. Also, the
project impact in building up SEASA' s management and technical capabilities
promises a high degree of continuity in sector development.
7.02 A significant risk is the financing and carrying out of major repairs and
replacement of equipment. particularly pumps. after 10 to 15 years of operation.



-6-
This not only could be a costly undertaking but will also require the development
of  technically  satisfactory  alternatives.   One  alternative would be  the
development of this capability in Paraguay, preferably by private contractors.
This alternative, however, could not be viable because of the small size of the
market. Another altornativ, would be the identification of suitable contractors
abrdad. SENASA could provide a focal point to the communities in solving this
problem, as part of its overall assistance to the communities in operating and
maintaining their water systems. The financing of these major repairs could,
however, be hampered by the insufficiency of resources in the fund for major
repairs created under Bank-financed projects (para. 6.06).
7.03 Despite the success of the project, it is clear that new sector policies
and practices need to be explored to allow faster improvements in service
coverage. Only 52 of the rural population, which accounts for 641 of the total
population, has access to safe water supply. The revised policies should aim at
furtheo improvements in cost recovery and reductions in government subsidies. In
particular, the high level of subsidy, which encourage preference for full
connections- as opposed to standpipes and other low-cost solutions- should be
reduced. The lower subsidies should lead to better national service coverage.
This could be accomplished by a set of measures that includes:
a)    seeking wider project replicability by a better match of the service
level with the population's ability end willingness to pay.
Consideration should be given to different services levels based on
the community ability to make initial contributions to project
investment and to service their debts; and
b)    establishing terms and conditions for the subloans that ensure a
more satisfactory cost recovery and transparency of the subsidies to
the communities. Consideration should be given to market-determined
interest rates.
8. Bank Performance
8.01   The performance of the Bank was satisfactory.  Its contribution to the
project helped to achieve the expected results, and provided an opportunity to
improve SENASA' staff and management. A weakness in Bank performance was the low
supervision effort particularly in 1985 and thereafter.   Although the low
supervision coefficient during this period largely coincided with the loan
disburement suspension (par&. 5.02). a more intense supervision could have
helped SENASA to take timely actions to resolve issues affecting project
implementation; including insufficient supervision of beneficiaries by SENASA's
staff (para. 9.01).
8.02 The Bank has learned key lessons that should be used in future projects,
such as the need tot
(a)   build-in a suitable mechanism to ensure that funds and technology will be
available for major system repairs;
(b)   deal with procurement issues early in project preparation, and promptly
resolve problems which arise during project execution; and
U1



- 7 -
(c)   maintain adequate and timely supervision inputs throughout the project
life regardless of any hiatus in disbursements.
9. Borrower Perfofmance
9.01   SENASA met the project objectives under the loan and project benefits were
acknowledged by the communities. SENASA, however, confronted administrative and
financial bottlenecks early in project implementation that constrained the timing
and quality of its assistance to the communitiesa Both the completion of the
subprojects and the transfer of the completed systems to the committes were
often delayed, and most of the systems initiated operations without formal
transfer to the committees because of pending works. These delays also had
negative implications on SENASA's finances, since the communities initiated the
repayment of their loans only after formally taking over the operation and
administration of the systems.
9.02 The main lessons learned from the Borrower's actions in the project are as
follows: (a) the Ministry of Health should provide a more effective support to
SENASA, particularly for the timely transfer of required budgetary resources; (b)
SENASA  should  concentrate  on more  effective  and  efficient  construction
supervision and provide timely technical assistance to sustain community support;
and (c) SENASA should maintain better communication with the Ministry of Finance
on procurement matters, including discussions regarding understanding of Bank
guidelines.
9.03 Based on these lessons, the Borrower should: (a) maintain the technical
assistance program in the beneficiary communities to help them continue sound
operational practices; and (b) extend the technical assistance program to new
communities willing to participate in future projects.
10. Proiect Relationship
10.01 The Bank's relationship with the Government and SENASA has been generally
positive. SENASA staff was assiduous in assisting Bank missions during
preparation and supervision work. Mission relations with the Ministry of Health,
however, were weak during the course of the project, with project issues only
being discussed at SENASA's level, precluding the possibility of timely solutions
to problems requiring participation of higher level officials in the Ministry.
At the end of the project, as a direct result of the change of government. this
situation changed to one of openness in the discussion of project issues with the
Minister of Health and actions were taken to remedy promptly any constraints that
affected project execution.
11. Consultinx Services
11.01 The performance of consultants was satisfactory. Technical assistance in
the areas of project management and operational and financial administration
brought about excellent results in upgrading SENASA's personnel capabilities and
implementing new procedures. The consultants provided on-the-job training to
SENASA's personnel in different disciplines. They participated with local promot-
ers and health educators in community meetings where project plans were dis-
cussed, including issues on water tariffs , system maintenance, sanitation works,



and vater quality. Simple accounting and operational procedures were also
established at each of the beneficiary counuities. Though the technical assis-
tance contract was amended in 1985 to extend consultant services, the extreme
delay in the project schedule made it impossible for the consultant. to *assit
SENASA at the end of the project, during the most active construction period.
12. Proioct Documentatlon and Data
12.01 Loan Agroement 2014-PA clearly reflected the agreements between the
Government and the Bank in relation to project objectives and main actions
required to meet the objectives. Amendments were expoditiously processod. The
appraisal report provided a useful framework for both Bank and SENASA In project
planning and supervision work.

PART II. BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
This is a summary of SERASA's opinion on project execution.
Comments on Part I
We asree with the Bank's perspective on project execution. The standard of
living of the population served by the project has improved significantly, and
at a faster rate than the average for the country. By project completion, the
population b-nefitted by the project would exceed the original target of 60,000
people.
In relation to the delay in project execution we have the following
coments:
(a)   the Government's tight financial situation resulted in extremely
limited funds being available to finance the local costs of the
project despite the priority assigned to it. Only financing of local
costs out of the loan proceeds made a satisfactory project comple-
tion poss:tble;
(b)   the suspension of loan disbursements in 1985 weakened SENASA's
project execution capability; and
(c)   the special audit of SERASA's activities carried out by the new
government in 1989 resulted in a number of actions, including: (i)
the appointment of a new Director; and (ii) negotiations with
communities and contractors to accelerate completion of works in
progress, and the turning over to the communities of the water
systems already completed.
SERASA'os institutional capability has been substantially improved by the
two Bank-financed projects (Loans 1502-PA and 2014-PA). The technical assistance
provided by the Pan American Health Organization has contributed to developing
within SERASA a team of experts capable of maintaining quality of the services
provided to the communities.
The communities had an excellent participation record in the project.
SENASA intends to maintain the system of community participation in future
projectq.
Bank Performance
Bank interventions were positive and aimed at improving SERASA's
capabilities. SERASA and Bank's staff cooperated closely. Bank staff provided
assistance to SERASA in resolving problems requiring participation of other
government authorities, and frequently visited the communities and project sites.
More intensive Bank assistance during the latter stages of project execution
would have been desirable.



- 10 -
SENASA Perforuance
SENASA compliod with project conditionality. and a particular effort was
made to create an operations and maintenance unit to provide technical assistance
to the communities.
SENASA reached maturity as a result of the project. Technical assistance
required for future projects then can be focussed on solocted areas still in need
of improvement.
