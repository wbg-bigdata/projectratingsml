SECCIND RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Paraguay has requested the continuation of Bank
financial assistance for the expansion and improvement of water supply in
rural communities.  1/  The project will benefit rural communities in the
seven departments (para. 5.01) east of the Paraguay River. The project was
prepared by the National Service for Environmental Sanitation (SENASA) with
the assistance of the resident PAHO consultant and of the Bank. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$18.5 million equivalent. A Bank loan
of US$11.8 million equivalent is recommended to finance the foreign exchange
component and interest during construction in the amount of US$2.3 million.
The borrower will be the Republic of Paraguay, and the executing agency will
be SENASA.   This will be the second Bank group operation in the sector in
Paraguay.   The works to be financed are scheduled  for construction  and
completion during 1981-85.
II. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
Background
2.01      Paraguay, a landlocked country with an area of 407,000 km 2, is
endowed with vast areas of unutilized land well suited to agriculture and
livestock.   There is substantial hydroelectric potential,  largely on the
Parana River which forms the country's eastern and southern borders.
2.02      The economic potential of the country began to be more fully re-
alized during the 1970's with the rapid expansion of land under cultivation
and the construction of hydroelectric plants to tap the Parana River's po-
tential. This has resulted in an acceleration of growth: per capita income
grew at an average annual rate of 5.2% during the 1972-78 period, compared
with the 1.2% averaged during the previous 30 years.   Rising per capita
incomes have been accompanied by improvements in standards of living. Small
landholders, however, continue to have a low standard of living, due in part
to limited access to social and production support services despite efforts
to expand coverage.
1/ Communities with 400-4,000 inhabitants. For water supply and sanitation
activities, centers with populations of over 4,000 inhabitants are con-
sidered urban, and those with less than 4,000 inhabitants, rural.



-2-
Population
2.03       The mid-1980 population of Paraguay was estimated at 3.06 million
inhabitants.   Urbanization has occurred gradually: only 37% of the popu-
lation are living in municipal administrative centers which are defined as
urban centers. The annual population growth rate between the 1962 and 1972
censuses was 2.6%, with the urban areas growing at 3% p.a. and the rural
areas at 2.4% p.a.   The present growth rate for the total population is
estimated to have increased to about 2.9% p.a.
Health Situation
2.04      Health statistics in Paraguay are only partial and do not permit a
thorough analysis of the incidence of water-related diseases. For 1975-80,
life expectancy was estimated at 64 years and infant mortality at a high 85
per 1,000 live births (55 in Chile, 50 in Colombia, and 43 in Uruguay). As
reported by the Ministry of Public Health, enteric and diarrheal diseases
were the second major cause of death for all ages in 1976. These diseases
were also among the five major causes of hospitalization. Health statistics
are available in project files.
Water Resources
2.05       Paraguay is located in the basin of the Parana and Paraguay Rivers,
whose affluents provide abundant surface water. Paraguay also has extensive
groundwater resources, which provide the supply for domestic consumption in
most small communities.
2.06      A hydrological study for the Chaco region was completed in 1979.  A
similar study is currently being undertaken in the eastern region of the
country.   These studies by providing reliable information on the availab-
ility of groundwater for human and animal consumption will help form the
basis for the colonization of new areas and for the expansion of livestock
production.
Sector Organization
2.07      Overall  responsibility  for water  supply and sanitation sector
planning rests with the Technical Planning Secretariat of the Presidency.
All plans must be approved by the National Council for Economic Coordination
before they become official and eligible for Government financial support.
Responsibility for preparing sector plans, however, is left to the initia-
tive of the main sector institutions,  the Corporation for Sanitary Works
(CORPOSANA) and SENASA.1/ A high level Coordinating Committee, composed of
representatives of the Technical Planning Secretariat, CORPOSANA and SENASA,
was recently established to coordinate sector activities and to prepare a
five-year plan.
1)  A. third organization under the Ministry of Defense  is responsible for
sector activities in the Chaco region.



2.08      Present institutional arrangements originated in 1954, when
CORPOSANA, a financially autonomous Government agency under the Ministry of
the Interior,  was created to serve the capital (Asuncion).   Since 1965,
CORPOSANA has also been in charge of providing water, sewerage and solid
waste collection and disposal services to all communities with populations
over 4,000.
2.09      Until 1972, the few sector activities carried out in communities
*        with less than 4,000 inhabitants were under the aegis of the Ministry of
Public Health. That year, SENASA, a decentralized agency under the Ministry
of Public Health, was created to execute environmental sanitation projects
in these communities.  In addition to its responsibility for water supply and
sewerage services, SENASA is charged with the control of industrial hygiene,
food quality, solid waste disposal, vectors, insects and environmental
pollution.
2.10      The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has assisted SENASA
since its creation. The Bank has also been substantially involved in
SENASA's development since 1977 through the Rural Water Supply Project,
financed under Loan 1502-PA.  SENASA's institutional improvements during the
last three years such as the creation of units in charge of promoting
and coordinating community participation, construction supervision, opera-
tion assistance to communities and efficiency in administrative procedures,
have been noticeable.   SENASA's increasing responsibilities will require,
however, further institutional strengthening (paras. 3.06 and 3.07).
2.11      Local Sanitation Committees (Juntas de Saneamiento) constituted by
the communities, actively participate in the construction and financing of
water supply and sanitation systems. Once the systems are constructed, the
Committees administer, operate and maintain them with SENASA technical
assistance and supervision.
2412      The institutional sector arrangements summarized above are for the
most part satisfactory. The different institutions complement each other,
and there is a clear distribution of functions and responsibilities. There
are two areas where improvements are needed and for which the Government
authorities are considering specific solutions.   They are:   (a) lack of a
national water law to plan and regulate the rational use of hydraulic re-
sources and to control water pollution (existing regulations are scattered
through many codes); and (b) inadequate coordination of sector plans with
other sectors of the economy. The authorities concerned with the lack of unified
water legislation are gathering and analyzing existing information with the
view of establishing a comprehensive water law. More active participation of
the National Council of Economic Coordination in sector planning should help
solve the coordination problem (para. 2.20).
Service Levels and Quality - Water Supply
2.13      Water supply coverage in Paraguay is among the lowest in Latin
America. Coverage in 1980 was estimated at only 22% (664,600 inhabitants) of
total dwellings, 18% through house connections and 4% through public stand-
pipes.  Urban areas had a coverage of 41%.  About 58% of the population of



-4-
Asuncion was served, and the remaining urban areas had an average coverage of
11%. Rural population had to rely on unsafe private wells or water vendors,
with consequently high health risks. Only 5% (95,700 inhabitants) of rural
dwellings were reported to be served by house connections in 1980, and
another 5% were served by public standpipes.
2.14      SENASA did not start investing in water supply for rural areas
until 1976.   As a result of this late start, service coverages are still
extremely low. Asuncion has benefited from about 85% of CORPOSANA's sector
investments for urban areas in the last nine years.  The rest of the urban
areas, harboring about 55% of the urban population, have received only 15% of
CORPOSANA's investments. As a result, people living in urban areas outside
Asuncion have,  for the most part, no access to piped water.   Although no
comprehensive plan has yet been developed (para. 2.07), present investment
programs have been so designed as to partly remedy the unbalanced distrib-
ution of past sector investments.
2.15      CORPOSANA regularly monitors water quality only in Asuncion, where
the  quality  of  water  is  satisfactory;  two  other  urban  systems  under
CORPOSANA, using surface water do not have systematic quality control. The
remaining 20 urban public water systems use groundwater, which is
chlorinated   and   of   acceptable   quality.           Private   wells   are,
for the most part, unsatisfactorily constructed and present high risks of
contamination.
Service Levels and Quality - Sewerage and Sanitation
2.16      Only Asuncion has sewerage services (a coverage of about 50% or
340,000 inhabitants). The rest of the urban areas have either septic tanks
or latrines.   In rural areas, the use of latrines is widespread.  In 1980,
about 90% of dwellings used that means of excreta disposal.  Most of these
homemade  latrines do not comply with minimum standards of safety.   They
constitute a considerable health hazard not only for the users, but also for
the population of the area.  About 9% of the country's dwellings were re-
ported not to have any means of human waste disposal in 1980.
Past Sector Investments
2.17      Annual sector investments in 1970-79 averaged US$9.0 million in
1980 prices.  The problem of this low level of investments in relation to
needs was compounded by the unbalanced geographical distribution of invest-
ments. Sector investments until 1975 were undertaken only by CORPOSANA, with
Asuncion receiving a disproportionately high share of the total. Since 1976,
CORPOSANA has gradually increased the investment share for other urban
areas, and SENASA has slowly started to invest in water systems for rural
areas.
2.18      External financing has played an important role by helping finance
almost all sector investment programs implemented during the past 10 years.
External Lenders have been ERXK  NK, USAIJD, IIDR, andj,  t4xc) l977, th, Rn
and KfW for rural areas and UNICEF for rural dispersed populations (below 400
inhabitants).



-5-
2.19      There is no comprehensive financial policy for the sector as a
whole. Investments in urban areas have been undertaken without any policy of
recovery from the users.   Even operating costs have been routinely sub-
sidized.  SENASA, on the other hand, requires rural communities to provide
100% of operating and maintenance costs, not less than a 10% initial con-
tribution to investments (part in cash and the remainder in labor and ma-
terials) and debt service on a minimum of 10% of investment costs.  These
financial terms are considered affordable by the larger rural communities.
The terms might have to be somewhat softened, however,  for smaller com-
munities if a lower capacity to pay so warrants.
Sector Objectives and Programs
2.20      Lack of adequate sector planning has resulted in the absence of
long- or medium-term investment programs. Programs developed independently
by each sector institution appear unrelated to financial and absorptive
capacities. Furthermore, sector development has not yet been analyzed in a
macro-economic context.   The recent creation of the Coordinating Committee
and more active participation of the Technical Planning Secretariat will
provide the basis for the establishment of a comprehensive sector investment
program.
2.21      A report produced in November 1980 by PAHO consultants and par-
tially financed by Loan 1502-PA (available in project files) thoroughly
analyzes the sector, identifies its major constraints and proposes a ten-
year investment program.  It also proposes a set of measures to overcome the
most pressing cornstraints to sector development.   This report was prepared
with the active participation of the Technical Planning Secretariat,
CORPOSANA and SENASA and is now under Government consideration.
2.22      The proposed investment program, with a cost of about US$300 mil-
lion equivalent -in 1980 prices, would require average annual investments of
about US$30 million, or a 230% increase over average annual sector invest-
ments during the past decade.  This increase, although impressive at first
sight, should be achievable if the low present coverage levels and the low
investments undertaken during the past ten years are considered. Further-
more, sector investments in the year 1979 amounted to US$14 million.
2.23      The proposed plan would be financed through increases in Govern-
ment contributions, based on identified projects up to 1985 and on subsequent
increases proportional to the growth of GDP thereafter. The financing of the
program also relies on increased internal cash generation and user contrib-
utions, mainly from urban systems administered by CORPOSANA.  Finally, ex-
ternal borrowing should also play a major role in the financing of sector
development.  The proposed investment program would be financed by approx-
imately 40% Government contribution, 40% external borrowing and 20% internal
cash generation (CORPOSANA and SENASA) or consumer contributions. Detailed
sources and uses of funds are available in project files.

2.24      The proposed ten-year investment program aims to reach the fol-
lowing coverages by the year 1990:

Latrines                 54%      55%
Total Served             91%      97%
2.25      As explained before, the proposed targets appear achievable pro-
vided that the sector institutions substantially improve their performance
especially in the areas of financial policies and cost recovery, manpower and
programming.
Manpower Aspects
2.26      In  1980,  the  sector  employed  about  1,498  people  (1,046  in
CORPOSANA, 392 in SENASA and 62 in private consulting firms). About 7% of
them were professionals, and 60% technicians or white collar workers.  The
remaining 23%, unskilled labor. Uncompetitive remuneration, especially when
compared with employment opportunities in the major hydroelectric plants at
Itaipu and Yacireta, have adversely affected the ability of the two main
sector institutions to hire and retain qualified professional staff (para.
3.05).
2.27      The National University of Asuncion prepares professionals in the
fields of civil and sanitary engineering. Presently, about 60 professionals
a year are graduated from the six-year study program, of which about ten
begin their professional lives in the water supply and sanitation sector.
About 20 specialized technicians are trained at the National University's
Basic Sciences Institute each year. Sector manpower preparation and train-
ing is insufficient to significantly accelerate sector development.  Major
efforts are planned to increase training possibilities, especially for
second-line executives and specialized technicians.

Experience Under the Previous Bank Loan
2.28       Implementation of the US$9.7 million rural water supply and sani-
tation project (Loan 1502-PA) is proceeding satisfatorily. A delayed start
of works, mainly due to administrative problems, has been compensated for by
better-than-expected performance during 1980. It is expected that the pro-
sject will be completed by August 1982, without major delays beyond appraisal
estimates (Dec. 81).  Disbursements as of May 1, 1981, amounted to US$3.0
million or 50% of the total Loan amount (US$6.0 million). Physical execution
equivalent to about 52% of the total cost of works had been completed as of
that date.   Community participation has been successful, not only in the
financing of the works, but also in helping SENASA to implement the project
(para.  4.03).  SENASA has a high demand for sanitary units; however, the
installation  of these units has been going at a slow pace.   Constraints
affecting the initiation of the bidding processes have been removed and no
further problems are envisaged for the units' installation.
2.29       SENASA has greatly benefited from the technical assistance program
financed by Loan 1502-PA and is acquiring valuable experience in dealing with
rural water supply and sanitation programs. Consulting services in the areas
of accounting, inventory control, operation and maintenance of water systems
equipment, and for drilling have been provided. Their performance has been
satisfactory.  Their participation has helped SENASA to better tackle its
growing responsibilities. The performance of the project (contracted under
agreement with PAHO) has been an important factor in improving SENASA's
managerial capabilities. PAHO has completed studies in the areas of account-
ing, operation of water systems, supply of materials and inventory control.
The recommendations of these studies are being implemented with satisfactory
results.
III.  THE BORROWER AND THE EXECUTING AGENCY
Introduction
3.01       The Borrower will be the Government of the Republic of Paraguay,
which is also the Borrower in the first Bank-financed rural water supply
project (Loan 1502-PA).
3.02       SENASA, formed in 1972 as an agency of the Ministry of Health, will
be  the executing  agency.   SENASA  is  in  charge  of planning,  preparing,
promoting, financing, constructing and supervising construction and admini-
stration and control of services of sanitary works for villages with fewer
than 4,000 inhabitants. It is also responsible for the same activities for
the dispersed population.  In addition, SENASA is in charge of supervising
activities in the areas of industrial hygiene, food quality control and
general sanitation, including solid waste disposal, vector control and pol-
lution control.



-8-
The Executing Agency
3.03       SENASA's present organization (Figure 1) includes seven depart-
ments under the responsibility of the General Director, who reports to the
Minister of Public Health. There is also a permanent legal advisor. Four of
the departments deal with general sanitation, industrial hygiene, food insp-
ection and community promotion, and training.   Another is responsible for
SENASA's general administration and accounting.   The two last departments
are responsible for engineering and project design, and project implement-
ation and operations.
3.04       SENASA's General Director is required by law to be a civil engineer
specialized in sanitary engineering. He is appointed by the President of the
Republic upon the recommendation of the Minister of Health. The Director is
assisted by an advisory committee whose members, all specialized civil
servants, are appointed by the President upon recommendation of the Minister
of Health.   The General Director  controls  technical,  administrative  and
financial activities, and acts in close coordination with the Ministry of
Public Health.
3.05      SENASA is staffed by 392 civil servants.   The qualifications of
these employees, particularly those of the engineers and specialized tech-
nicians, are satisfactory. The country's rapid economic growth and con-
sequent increased demand for professional services have caused a shortage of
qualified, higher-level professionals in the fields of engineering, adminis-
tration and finance. The shortage is aggravated by the low level of salaries
in SENASA.   Inadequate compensation has caused many trained staff to take
positions in the private sector where salaries are substantially higher. A
change in SENASA's remuneration policies would be necessary in order to slow
down the drain of top level personnel.   It will not be easy  to effect
improvements of compensation for professionals in SENASA.   Top Government
officials fear that any such change could have a chain reaction in the rest
of the public sector and could result in an excessive burden on Government
finances.
3.06      The start of operations of the systems financed under Loan 1502-PA
and the execution of the project will increase SENASA's responsibilities.
After SENASA has executed the works, it will be in charge of overseeing
administration and major maintenance of the rural sanitation systems.
SENASA will also be responsible for supplying any necessary technical sup-
port to the communities, which will in turn be responsible for the day-to-day
operation of the systems. These responsibilities will further tax SENASA's
limited staff resources.   SENASA has agreed to increase the number of its
higher level staff to better cope with its expanded responsibilities. Agree-
ment was reached during negotiations (para. 9.02 (a)) that SENASA will
provide to the Bank, by December 31, 1981, a comparative study of SENASA's
remuneration vis-a-vis other government agencies and the private sector, and
by June 30, 1982, a plan of action including an implementation schedule,
satisfactory to the Bank addressing the problem of salary levels and provid-
ing actions that SENASA will take to resolve this problem and a plan and
implementation schedule satisfactory to the Bank to hire a suificient number
of qualified, permanent staff members to execute Loan 1502-PA and the
project. The plan should also include the organization of technical assist-
ance and training for the communities benefitting from both projects.

3.07       SENASA plans  to adopt a new organization structure  that while
keeping intact the Departments of General Sanitation, Industrial Hygiene,
Food Inspection and Community Promotion, Training, and Administration (para.
3.03), would place systems operation and maintenance under a new department.
The Department of Construction would join the Project Design and Imple-
mentation Department.   The new organizational  structure would  formalize
SENASA's present informal structure which has been working satisfactorily.
It is expected that the reorganization will be in operation before December
31, 1981.   Three fixed-term consultants will be hired under the technical
assistance component of the project (para. 6.13) to work in close coordin-
ation with and provide on-the-job training to the heads of the Departments of
Administration and Finances, Planning and Engineering, and Operation and
Maintenance. Appointment of these consultants will be a condition of Loan
effectiveness (paras. 6.20 and 9.03).
Accounting System
3.08      As part of the technical assistance program financed under Loan
1502-PA, SENASA has developed a standard accounting system to record its
operations. The system will permit SENASA to produce yearly balance sheets
and income and cash flow statements. The system will also permit SENASA to
keep project accounts separate from its other accounts. SENASA has started
to implement the new system and has produced its first annual statement of
accounts (December 31, 1980). The project aims to continue to assist SENASA
in the implementation of the new accounting system (para. 6.13 (b)). Train-
ing of accountants and bookkeepers in the new accounting procedures would be
part of the technical assistance program (para. 6.13 (c)).
Audit
3.09       SENASA is audited by two different Government entities.  The per-
manent auditors of the Ministry of Health carry out internal auditing once a
year. The General Controllers Office, which maintains a permanent office in
SENASA, checks all vouchers and reports quarterly to the Minister of Health.
In compliance with a covenant under Loan 1502-PA, an independent external
auditor prepares an audit based on generally accepted accounting principles
and sends the reports to the Minister of Public Health and to the Bank. The
independent auditing is performed on accounts dated as of December 31 of each
year. Audit reports prepared by Mr. Insfran Lopez are satisfactory. Assur-
ances were obtained during negotiations that SENASA will continue to
have its accounts as of December 31 of each year audited by external account-
ants acceptable to the Bank and submit a report on the results of the audit
to the Bank not later than four months after the end of each year (para. 9.02
(b)).
Compliance with Loan Covenants
3.10       SENASA is in compliance with all loan covenants; however, even if
most of the communities are complying with the covenanted initial 5% con-
tribution to investment (Loan 1502-PA),   seven communities out of 19 which
have works under construction have failed to comply with this covenant.
Prior to loan negotiations, SENASA furnished the Bank with a satisfactory
plan to resolve this situation (para. 7.06).

IV. THE BENEFICIARIES
Organization
4.01      The beneficiaries of the Loan will be the Sanitary Committees of
the village covered by the proposed Loan. The Committees are in charge of
the operation and maintenance of water services at the local level.  The
Committees are also responsible for preparing proposals to SENASA on tariffs
for water services.
4.02      The Committees follow a standard pattern set by SENASA in the Rules
and Regulations for the Sanitary Committees (Reglamento de las Juntas de
Saneamiento, Decree 8910, Sept. 10, 1974).   This document spells out the
organization and the obligations of each committee and defines the relation-
ship between the Committees and SENASA.   The Committees manage their own
assets and funds, and have Boards of Directors and Legal Representatives.
The Committees are first organized on a provisional basis by SENASA.  Once
they obtain their legal charters, new Boards are elected.   Each Board is
usually composed of five people (the number can be increased to nine): the
executive officer (who is also the President and Legal Representative) named
by the municipality, and four members elected by the community.
4.03      Experience under Loan 1502-PA has shown that the Committees are
willing to learn and that in general the village water supply systems are
well managed.  All Committees, however, share the following problems:
(a) lack of previous experience in water supply;
(b) lack of training in accounting and basic managerial
skills; and
(c) inadequate experience in operational and maintenance prac-
tices.
SENASA is aware of these shortcomings.   The training program designed by
SENASA aims to teach managerial and technical skills to the Committees
through:   (a) training courses at the village level in the operation and
maintenance of water systems; (b) specific technical assistance programs for
each community to teach accounting principles; and (c) specific assistance
in the formulation and implementation of tariff structures that would guar-
antee the finlancial viability of each entity (para. 6.12).
Accounting
4.04      Each Committee is required by SENASA to implement an accrual ac-
counting system based on guidelines prepared by SENASA.  Since most of the
beneficiaries have never had water systems, lack of experience impedes im-
plementation of the accounting systems. The project aims to correct these
deficiencies by providing part-time consultants to train SENASA personnel,
who in turn will organize and implement an adequate accounting system in each
beneficiary village (para. 6.12).



- 12 -
Audit
4.05       Because of the small size of the operation in each community,
annual external audits will not be required. Assurances were obtained from
SENASA during negotiations that specialized personnel from SENASA's account-
ing department will audit the accounts of each Committee once a year (para.
9.02 (k)). The technical assistance program would include the creation of a
procedure for internal audit, including the audit of Committee accounts.
V. POPULATION, SERVICES, AND DEMAND
IN THE PROJECT CITIES
Introduction
5.01      The project area (Map 15609), embracing seven departments, 1/ re-
presents only about 15% of the country's area, but contains about 40% of the
country's population (1980 estimates).  The project area is the most rapidly
developing region in the country as a result of the expansion of the agri-
cultural frontier and the decision to build three large hydroelectric pro-
jects (Itaipu, Yacyreta, and Corpus) in the area.  To support this growth,
complementary rural infrastructure, transportation and industrial projects
are underway. Additional rural and urban projects are under consideration.
Geographic and socio-economic data on the area are available in the Project
File.
5.02       In recognition of the increasing developmental potential of this
area, the Bank's strategy is to emphasize operations in the southeastern part
of the country.   The expected result of this emphasis is to maximize the
benefits of complementary investments in that area. The proposed project is
in line with the Bank's strategy.
Water Resources
5.03      Water resources do not limit the provision of water supply ser-
vices in the project communities. Surveys of sources, mostly groundwater,
are being financed under Credit 587-PA (Preinvestment Studies Project). Ex-
perience under Loan 1502-PA has shown that aquifers are frequently within a
depth of 100-200 m in sandstone. Water quality is good and the only treat-
ment necessary would be chlorination.   Information on water resources is
available in the Project File.
Existing Water Supply and Sewage Systems
5.04      In the communities to be benefited by the project, water is ob-
tained from shallow wells or nearby rivulets.  Water from these unreliable
sources is distributed to most of the population by water carriers who sell
200-liter cans at prices of up to US$1.60 per can. Excreta disposal systems
(latrines) are in most cases unsatisfactory.

Population Served and Service Levels
5.05       In 1980, the population living in communities of less than 4,000
inhabitants and in dispersed rural areas was estimated as about 2.1 million,
or 72% of the country's total population. Only 5% of this rural population
had access to water supply. The project would provide chlorinated water to
65,000 people in 49 villages, 80% by house or courtyard connections and 20%
*           by access to public standpipes.  The project, together with projects financed
by Loan 1502-PA, KfW lending and other minor programs, would increase house
connections for water to about 80% of the population in 118 communities with
400-4,000 inhabitants. 1/
Health Related Indicators
5.06      Health statistics in Paraguay are seriously distorted because of
the lack of an efficient information system.   Health conditions are poor
compared with those of other countries with similar GNP. Life expectancy is
64 years, and infant mortality is as high as 85 per 1,000 live births.
Diarrheal and enteric diseases are the second most common cause of mortality
for all ages. These diseases are closely linked with unsafe water supply and
poor sanitation conditions.
Population and Demand Projections
5.07      Population growth for the communities that would benefit from the
project is estimated at 2.4% per year. Design horizon is assumed at 20 years
with an intermediate stage of 10 years for some installations (mainly pro-
duction, pumping and water storage). Per capita demand has been estimated as
120 1/day through house connections and 30 1/day through standpipes.
5.08      Water metering in the new systems is not planned.  Water will be
billed in accordance with a tariff structure based on consumption per unit of
sanitary features in use in each dwelling (Annex 3).  This system, widely
used in rural areas of Paraguay, is satisfactory (para. 7.17).
VI. THE PROJECT
Introduction
6.01      The project is a follow up of the project financed under Loan 1502-
PA.  The Government requested Bank participation in the project in 1979.
Since then, three Bank missions have visited Paraguay to assist SENASA with
project identification and preparation.
1/ The number of communities within this range is estimated at 200, with a
total population of about 200,000.



- 14 -
6.02      The project would provide water supply and sanitation services to
about 49 rural communities with populations of 400-4,000 in seven depart-
ments not covered by Loan 1502-PA. The aggregate 1980 population of these 49
communities (about 65,000 inhabitants) represents 33% of the total pop-
ulation living in the 200 communities of 400-4,000 inhabitants. The project
is expected to be completed by December 1985.
6.03       The following table gives the distribution of population of the
communities which have been identified by SENASA to be included in the
project.

Project Objectives
6.04  The main project objectives are to:
(a) provide chlorinated water to 100% (80% through house con-
nections and 20% through standpipes) of the 1985 population
of 49 rural communities.
(b) provide sanitary units for 2,000 families in these rural com-
munities and to assist in the construction of safe latrines
for another 2,000 families in these communities;
(c) promote better hygiene habits and contribute to public
health improvement;
(d) continue strengthening the managerial and operational cap-
abilities of SENASA; and
(e) promote community participation in the project, and thus
ensure a financial policy of community contribution in ini-
tial investment and tariffs to cover operation, maintenance
and partial recovery of investment.

Criteria for Eligibility of Communities
6.05       SEINASA has identified 49 rural communities in need of construction
or extension of water supply systems (Annex 1).            SENASA agreed on the
following selection criteria:
(a) all communities would have populations of 400-4,000 inhab-
itants;
(b) all communities would be located in the seven
specified departments (paras. 5.01);
(c) subprojects must have a per capita construction cost of less
than US$130 1/ in January 1981 prices;
(d) hydrogeologic studies demonstrating the possibility of de-
veloping reliable sources of water easily and economically
must have been completed (para. 5.03);
(e) a sanitation committee (para. 4.01) must be set up in each
community to: (i) participate actively in the planning and
construction of the system; and (ii) take responsibility for
future administration, operation and maintenance of the
system.
Assurances were obtained from SENASA during negotiations that the above
selection criteria will be applied to all subprojects to be financed under
the Loan (paLra. 9.02 (c)).
6.06      Priority should be given to the communities  that expressed to
SENASA the desire to obtain water supply and excreta disposal systems, and
demonstrate the willingness and ability of the community to contribute to
construction costs.
6.07      Because the list of communities given as Annex 1 is preliminary,
it is possible that some might not comply with the selection criteria. In
this case, the communities would be replaced by others which meet the
selection criteria.
Service Stanidards
6.08      Water services in the project communities would be provided to 80%
of the population through house connections and to 20% through public stand-
pipes (para. 6.04). These standards are in accordance with the populations'
habits, expectations and ability to pay. It is not economically feasible to
extend service by house connection to all the population as many people are
scattered on the outskirts of the communities. Thus, water services would be

January 1981 prices, has been the average for water works for urban com-
munities of this size.

supplied through house connections in areas with more than five houses per
100 m of street length and through public standpipes to be located at less
than 200 m from the dwellings in areas with a density of less than five
houses per 100 m.   Water systems would be properly designed to suit the
least-cost solution.
6.09      The project includes the construction of sanitary units (shower,
toilet, lavatory, laundry facilities and a septic tank) for an estimated 20%
of the population of the project communities.   For the rest of the pop-
ulation,  the  project  will  provide  assistance  for  the  construction  of
latrines and septic tanks.
Status of Design
6.10      The project would be started by mid-1981  to ensure  the steady
continuation of the project under Loan 1502-PA. The shortage of technical
personnel in SENASA, however, could delay the timely completion of the neces-
sary studies and engineering designs.   It has therefore been agreed that
SENASA will hire qualified short-term consultants to assist in preparing the
necessary designs and studies. SENASA will pay the consultants from its own
'budget.   Final designs will be prepared in the following steps:  (a) com-
munity socioeconomic studies; (b) topographic surveys; (c) feasibility
studies; and (d) final designs.   SENASA submitted to the Bank feasibility
studies and final designs  for subprojects representing about 40% of the cost
of the project works prior to negotiations. Assurances were obtained from
SENASA during negotiations that final designs for the remaining communities
will be completed before December 31, 1981 (para. 9.02 (d)).
Project Description
6.11      The project would consist of:
(a)  construction of new or extension of existing water supply
systems in 49 rural communities (Annexes 1 and 2); a typical
water system would include:
(i) a drilled well, 100-200 m deep;
(ii) pumping equipment and a chlorination system;
(iii) a 10-100 m3 storage tank; and
(iv) a distribution network with house connections serving
about 80% of the population, and standpipes to serve
the remaining population;
(b) installation of about 2,000 sanitary units;
(c)  provision of equipment,  tools and technical assistance for
the construction of latrines and septic tanks;



- 17 -
(d) procurement of equipment and tools for regional laboratories
and well drilling operations, and for community repair shops;
(e)  procurement of trucks for SENASA's construction supervision;
(f)  provision of  educational  and promotional  programs  in the
participating communities in basic public health, during both
preparation and execution of the project; and
(g) provision of a technical assistance program to SENASA in
project management, and in operational and financial ad-
ministration (para. 6.13 (c)).
6.12       The  purpose  of the  educational  and promotional  program is to
stimulate village participation in the project and to ensure that project
benefits are fully realized.   This program,  a continuation of one begun
under Loan 1502--PA, would include seminars for Sanitation Committee mem-
bers on basic administration including basic accounting and assistance in
the formulation of tariff structures and operation of rural systems.   It
would also train operators.   In addition,  the program would provide se-
minars and lectures to housewives and school children in the villages on
water uses and benefits, and basic sanitation practices.
6.13       Strengthening  of  SENASA's  capabilities  in project  preparation
and supervision is essential to the implementation of the proposed pro-
ject, as well as to other current and future rural water supply and san-
itation projects.   Because of its shortage of qualified  top-level pro-
fessionals,  SENASA  has  been  relying  on  expatriate  consultants (para.
2.29). This practice is considered essential in the short term and should
continue   during   implementation   of   the   project.          The   technical
assistance program, an expansion of the program under Loan 1502-PA, is
intended  to provide  long-term strengthening of SENASA's abilities.   The
program would include:
(a)  services  of  three  consultants  for project management  for
two to four years each (one to act as Project Manager and
Advisor to the head of the Planning and Engineering Depart-
ment,  one  to advise  the  head  of  the  Administration  and
Finance Department and one to advise the head of the Opera-
tion and Maintenance Department);
(b) specific consulting services for SENASA's headquarters staff
in well construction, operation and maintenance of systems in
the communities, accounting and other areas as required;
(c) courses and seminars for various levels of SENASA field
personnel, sanitary inspectors and plumbers in the com-
munities, and SENASA staff in the administrative and finan-
cial areas; and
(d) overseas training for SENASA's personnel in hydrogeology,
drilling techniques and other areas as required.

Project Cost
6.14      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$18.5 million
equivalent, of which US$9.5 million (51%) represents the foreign exchange
component. The project cost includes: (a) 7% of the construction cost for
engineering and administrative expenses related to the project; (b) 12% of
the base cost for physical contingencies; and (c) 40% of the January 1981
project cost (US$5.30 million) for price escalation.   Price contingencies
for the local component were estimated using the following inflation in-
dexes: 21.5% in 1981, and 17.0% in 1982 and thereafter.  Price contingencies
for the foreign component were estimated at 9.8% in 1981, 8.5% in 1982 and
7.5% in 1983 and thereafter. Interest during construction, not included in
this amount, is estimated at US$2.3 million equivalent. Table 6.1 summarizes
the investment costs.  Detailed costs for a typical system is presented in
Annex 2.
6.15      Cost estimates are based on unit costs of recent contracts under
Loan 1502-PA for similar civil works and equipment.   SENASA applied these
costs, in January 1981 prices, to sample average communities. The mission
found the approach satisfactory and the estimates reliable.
6.16      About 110 man-months of consulting services are included for the
technical assistance to SENASA (an average of about US$6,000 per man-month).
Completion of final engineering designs and construction supervision will
require an additional 60 man-months of consulting services (at about
US$2,600 per man-month).   The average man-month cost represents the rate
billed by consulting firms for individuals and includes salaries, social
costs, travel, and the firm's overhead and profits.  Consultants for tech-
nical assistance to SENASA are expected to be foreign; those for completion
of final designs and construction supervision are expected to be local.
Project Financing
6.17      The Bank Loan would finance the project's US$9.5 million foreign
exchange component and US$2.3 million of interest during construction (56%
of the financing requirements, para. 7.08). The Government of Paraguay has
agreed to provide or cause to be provided financing in the amount of US$5.7
million (27%). The balance (US$3.7 million, or 17%) would be provided from
community contributions.
6.18      SENASA would receive from the Government (the Borrower) the pro-
ceeds of the Bank loan and the Government contributions as a grant.   Part
of these funds would be lent to the sanitary committees, and the remainder
would be granted (para. 7.13). Characteristics of loans and grants to the
communities and of recovery of funds are detailed in paras. 7.13 - 7.15.
Project Implementation
6.19      The bulk of the project would be executed during 1982-85 according
to the implementation schedules shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. This schedule
is compatible with SENASA's execution capabilities.   SENASA will hire the
management consultants and will procure tools ior well driYYitv  andA weYA
equipment  during  1981.   The  procurement,  after negotiations  and during

investments are given in Table 6.4.
6.20      Feasibility studies and final designs for work corresponding to
about 40% of the project works (para. 6.10) were prepared by competent local
consultants. For the remaining 60%, SENASA will use consultants to carry out
the surveys in situ and prepare data, and would use its own staff to complete
the final designs. Construction supervision is expected to be shared between
consultants and SENASA's permanent staff.  SENASA would be responsible for
community promotion and providing assistance for the construction of indi-
vidual excreta disposal systems. Other Ministry of Health personnel would
provide assistance for health-related activities. Assurances were obtained
from SENASA during Loan negotiations that it will employ qualified con-
sultants acceptable to the Bank to assist at the department level in project
management, operation and maintenance, and finances and administration
(para. 9.02 (e)).   Assistance in project management would continue to be
carried out by the project manager position provided under Loan 1502-PA.
Appointment of the management consultants will be a condition of loan effec-
tiveness (para. 9.03).
Procurement
6.21      All goods and services would be procured in accordance with Bank
guidelines.  All contracts for the purchase of imLaerials and equipment with
an estimated cost of US$100,000 equivalent or Ii1nrrG and all contracts for
civil works with an estimated cost of US$200,00r equivaient or more would be
awarded under international competitive bidding. To ,-e extent practicable,
civil works, materials and equipment would be so grouped as to make the
contracts attractive for international competitive bidding.  Contracts for
equipment and materials under US$100,000 and for civil works under
US$200,000 may be awarded on the basis of locally advertised tuOiiietitive
bidding in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. The total cost
of items procured under such procedures should not exceed an aggregate of
US$2,000,000 equivalent. Contracts for goods and for civil works estimated
to cost less than US$10,000 may be procured in accordance with local procure-
ment procedures,  satisfactory to the Bank.   The total cost of items so
procured should not exceed an aggregate of US$100,000.   Spare parts for
equipment used in the execution of the project may be procured through
negotiated purchases from established and reliable suppliers, provided, how-
ever, that the total cost of the items so procured shall not exceed an
aggregate of US$250,000. Local manufacturers would be given a 15% margin of
preference of the cif value or the applicable custom duty, whichever is
lower.  Pipes and cement are the only materials expected to be supplied by
local manufacturers.  During negotiations, agreement was reached on a pro-
curement schedule for the second semester of 1981 (para. 9.02 (f)).  Not
later than October 31 of each year, as long as goods or works remain to be
procured, the Bank and SENASA should agree on a procurement schedule for the
following year.
6.22      Since a necessary condition for the success of rural projects is
community participation in the form of labor, materials, transportation,
storage areas, cash contribution, etc., part of the civil works would be
executed by small local contractors, combined with voluntary community work

and force account methods.   Well drilling will be carried out mostly by
SENASA personnel.  SENASA personnel are working on similar tasks under the
ongoing project and are being trained on site by a qualified consultant.
Because the number of wells to be drilled under the project is large, the
possibility  of  using  private  drilling  companies  as  well  should  be
considered.
6.23      SENASA has already made available to the Bank a general procure-
ment notice to be published in the Development Forum.   Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that SENASA will update the notice annually as
long as any goods or works remain to be supplied (para. 9.02 (g)). The Bank
would have prior review and approval of invitations to bid and proposed
contract awards for all civil works contracts estimated to cost US$200,000 or
more and for contracts for materials and equipment estimated to cost
US$100,000 or more. For all other contracts, SENASA will submit to the Bank
for review copies of each contract together with the respective bidding
documents, bid analysis report and recommendations for award.
Disbursement
6.24      Disbursements of the Bank Loan, supported by normal documentation,
would be made over a four-year period according to the following categories
and percentages:
Category                         Amount (US$)                %

at appraisal.   This was principally due to initial delays resulting from
SENASA's inexperience, lack of drilling machines and delays in staffing the
institution. SENASA has resolved most of these problems satisfactorily and
disbursements and bidding for the 1980-81 purchase program have been pro-
ceeding at a good pace. The closing date for the proposed Loan would be June
30, 1986.
6.25      Assurances were obtained during ne&Rtiations  that prior to the
initiation of works or provision of equipment and materials in each
community, the concerned Sanitary Committee should provide an initial cash
downpayment of at least 2.5% of the construction cost of the water system
(para. 9.02 (h)).
Environmental Aspects
6.26      Water and excreta disposal problems would be dealt with simulta-
neously. Therefore, no adverse effects can be expected from the project; on
the contrary, surface levels of soil contamination would be reduced as a
result of latrinization in the rural areas.
VII. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
SENASA's Financial Performance
7.01      SENASA  is  a department  of  the  Central  Government  under  the
Ministry of Public Health.   Its administrative and operating expenses and
investments requirements in water supply and sanitary units are financed by
the Government's ordinary budget and from the special budget.  The special
budget is funded by a tax on beer consumption (1 per liter of locally brewed
beer and 02 per liter of imported beer).  Since 1977, SENASA's investment in
rural water supply systems and technical assistance has absorbed 65.5% of its
total allocated resources (Table 7.1). Operating expenses, including costs
of project preparation, engineering and supervision, amounted to 18.4% of
total resources.   Other programs, UNICEF and GTZ absorbed the remaining
16.1%.
7.02      SENASA's  annual budget  is submitted  to the Ministry of Public
Health for consideration. After the budget has been reviewed and discussed
with SENASA, it is included in the Ministry's General Budget and is submitted
to the Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance for final approval and
presentation to the Parliament. When supplementary resources are needed for
an unbudgeted program, the authorization of the Minister of Finance is
required.
7.03      As  shown  in Table  7.1,  SENASA's  resources  increased  from an
estimated 073.5 million (US$583,000) in 1977 (US$1.1 million 1980 equiva-
lent), to 0696.0 million (US$5.5 million) in 1980.  The main reason for this
growth is the increase in Government budgetary support from 33.1 million
(US$262,700) in 1977 (US$550,000 1980 equivalent) to 0267.5 million
(US$2.1 million) in 1980.
7.04      Receipts from the tax on beer, are lower than forecast.  The tax
per liter has not been changed thou%ix the grtc-e to cometr  Was erow  te_x
times.   This situation has affected the availability of funds for SENASA
operations, as the Government has not budgeted additional amounts to cover
the shortfalls. Higher-than-expected contributions to investments by some
communities (095.4 million in 1980, compared with 018.6 million in 1979) have
helped resolve this situation.

7.05      Community water supply and sanitary systems are financed by pro-
ceeds of the Bank Loans complemented by SENASA's budget resources and com-
munity contribution. Financing is also being provided to SENASA by KfW, and
donations from UNICEF.
Past Experience with Beneficiary Financial Performance
7.06      Before 1977, when Loan 1502-PA was signed,  SENASA financed the
installation of 14 water supply systems from its budget at a total cost of
044.1 million (US$350,000).   Recovery of funds  for these 14 projects is
considered satisfactory, although 5 communities have overdue accounts (Table
7.2). Prior to negotiations, SENASA furnished the Bank with a satisfactory
plan to deal with these overdue accounts.   Updated cost estimates for the
water systems in the 48 beneficiary villages under Loan 1502-PA is 0878
million (US$7.0 million). The combined cost of the 25 communities, for which
contracts between SENASA and the committees have been signed, amounts to 0595
million (US$4.7 million).  This cost has been shared as follows:  20.5% by
community contributions; 41% by the Bank Loan and the remaining 38.5% by the
Government. The community will repay about 11.5% of the cost over 15 to 17
years, together with interest of 6%.
7.07      The financial statements of 4 of the 14 villages that benefited
from SENASA financing were analyzed as representative of financial perform-
ance to be expected under the proposed project (Table 7.3). The economic and
social aspects of the four beneficiaries are similar to those of the com-
munities that would benefit from the Loan. Working ratios 1/ did not vary
widely. All villages show strong incomes from water sale revenues and all of
them had an acceptable net income. Average tariffs were in the range of 0500
to 0600 per connection per month.  Accounts receivable are low.  Long-term
debt is low as most of the investment was subsidized by the Ministry of
Health.  Fixed assets are not revalued and accumulated depreciation is low
since, in most cases, use of the new accounting system has only recently
begun.  Thus, even though some problems exist, SENASA appears to have been
successful in implementing rural water systems through Sanitary Committees.
Project Financing Plan
7.08      The total cost of the project is US$18.5 million equivalent.  In
addition the project requires financing of US$2.3 million of interest during
construction, to be also covered by the Loan which will not be charged to the
beneficiaries. The consolidated financing plan is presented in Table 7.4.

The Bank's contribution would cover the foreign exchange component and
interest during construction. The Government contribution would be in the
form of grants to SENASA, to be invested in the communities. The contribu-
tions of the communities would cover partial payment for water supply systems
and full payment for the sanitary units.
7.09      Table 7.5 shows the projected annual cash flow for SENASA during
the period 1982-85.   Because of the Government's decision not to increase
SENASA's ordinary budget by more than 10% a year (aside from amounts required
for debt service) and the low receipts expected from the tax on beer, the
Government will have to provide SENASA with budgetary allocations to cover
its total contribution to the project. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from the Government that it will provide the required budgetary
funds for the project (para. 9.01).   A supplementary letter to the legal
documents was agreed indicating the estimated annual Government contribution
to the project cost.
Community Financing Plan
7.10      The  total  investment  for the community water  systems would be
financed by the sum of the following: (a) initial community contribution; (b)
a loan from SENASA (with interest) to the community; and (c) a grant or
government contribution.
7.11      Community participation in initial investment is considered funda-
mental to the success of the project.  As noted in para.  7.06 contributions
have amounted to 20.5% of investment cost in the first 25 communities.  Some
decline in the average level of contributions is expected because of: (a)
the increase in capital cost of the project compared with previous projects;
and (b) the relatively lower saving capacity of the populations in the
smaller villages due to the recent immigration to the area of many inhabi-
tants and the consequent need to invest in such areas as housing and agri-
cultural improvements.
7.12      Until recently, most of SENASA's services had been concentrated in
areas nearer its headquarters in Asuncion.  According to SENASA's records,
the community contribution in new areas has been no greater than 15% of total
investment.   On the basis of mission estimates and SENASA's experience,
initial community contribution can be expected to total no more than 15%.
The contribution from each village will vary according to local ability to
pay. Each community will, however, be required to contribute a minimum of
10% of the initial investment cost to be eligible for financing under the
project.
7.13       SENASA would finance with the proceeds of the Bank Loan and Govern-
ment contributions the cost of construction of the water system, minus the
initial community contribution, plus the cost of material for individual
sanitary units.   Based on the socioeconomic study of the community, which
would indicate its ability to pay, SENASA and each community would agree on
the portion of capital expenditures that would be converted into an interest-
bearing loan which should cover at least 12% of the total investment. Under
Loan 1502-PA the average loan was 11% of the investment. Initial community
contribution and tariff revenues would cover in total at least 22% of invest-
ment costs, except in cases where SENASA and the Bank agree to a lower

figure.   SENASA and each community will enter into a subloan agreement,
specifying the amount and terms of the SENASA loan and the total community
participation,   including  cash  payments  (para.  7.16).          The  Sanitary
Committees would repay the loan in equal monthly installments over 15 to 20
years, with interest of 9.6% after a grace period equal to the construction
period plus 6 months.   The cost of material for individual sanitary units
would be paid back in full over a period of 3 years with interest of 9.6%.
The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.
7.14      The interest rate charged to the communities is equal to the inter-
est the Bank is charging on the Loan (now 9.6% per annum).   Although the
interest rate would be higher than the one charged under Loan 1502-PA (6%),
it would still be negative in real terms in view of current and expected high
inflation rates. The subsidy implied in the element of grant financing and
low interest rates is necessary to promote improvement of sanitary con-
ditions in villages with less than the country's average ability to pay.
Since works would be designed according to the least cost alternative (para.
6.08) and the comparison of alternatives will be quantified at a discount
rate equal to the country's estimated opportunity cost of capital, distor-
tions in resource allocations within the sector would be minimal.
7.15      The payment period (para. 7.13) is considered satisfactory.   Its
extension beyond the economic life of the system is not advisable because
of the difficulties that would arise from financing replacement of worn out
assets. The present system of assessing the amount to be charged as a loan
to the community and of establishing interest seems satisfactory and
practical. It has the benefit of making the villages conscious of the cost
of capital and the need to recover capital investments.
Subloan Agreements
7.16      Each contract between SENASA and the beneficiary Sanitary Com-
mittees would require Bank approval prior to the initiation of work or
provision of equipment and materials to the communities (para. 9.02 (i));
the contract will include the following specific conditions:
(a)  Sanitary  Committee:    each  Sanitary  Committee  should have
been duly recognized as a legal entity;
(b)  Project  Description:    each  agreement will  include  a de-
tailed description of each project component, and of its
quantities and costs; the contract will also list all proj-
ect plans and documents;
(c)  Initial Contribution:   total community contribution to the
construction cost of the water project should be specified
and equivalent to not less than 10%; unless the Bank other-
wise agrees, SENASA will cause each Committee to make a cash
down payment of 5%. An initial cash down payment of 2.5% is a
condition of initiating the works and providing of equipment
or materials to the village, with the remaining 7.5% to be
paid in the form of 2.5% in cash during the construction
period and 5% in material or labor; and



- 34 -
(d)  Revenue Covenant:   each Sanitary Committee will set tariffs
and other charges for water service at such a level as to
obtain enough revenues to cover:
(i)   normal operation and ordinary maintenance of the wa-
ter system;
(ii)  the deposit  in SENASA of an amount  for replacement
and major repairs, to be determined by agreement be-
tween SENASA and the community;
(iii) debt service to cover the loan from SENASA to the
community; in any case a minimum of 12% of the total
investment (para. 7.13).
(e)  Sanitary Units:  the number  of sanitary units  to be built
and the terms of repayment will be specified.
Tariff Structure 1/
7.17      The tariff levels would be based on the communities' ability to
pay, as determined by the socioeconomic studies prepared by SENASA, and on
the  level of total revenues  as covenanted  (para.   7.16).   Tariffs  are
revised periodically (usually yearly) by the Sanitation Committees with
the assistance of SENASA.   To keep tariffs in line with requirements for
funds, the rates are fixed at a basic amount for a courtyard connection,
plus an additional charge based on the number and types of sanitary
features used in each house. Normally, this assures that rates are closely
related to ability and willingness to pay, since the connection to the
system and the number of features are made at the request of the consumers.
Basic tariffs for yard connections range from 0350 (US$2.78) to 0650
(US$5.16) per month and from 050 (US$0.40) to 075 (US$0.59) per month for
public standpipes.   Monthly tariffs represent a maximum of 7% of average
monthly family cash income in the region.   This level of tariffs has been
implemented in the past with very good results.
7.18      The Committees also charge new customers a fee for access to the
service.   They also levy charges to cover materials and labor costs  for
connection to the system. These fees vary from one village to another, but
SENASA ensures that their level does not prevent low-income people from
connecting to the system.
7.19      The Committees are responsible for billing and collecting water
service  charges.   In the case of  standpipes,  collections  would be  the
responsibility of a subcommittee of users.  Where standpipes are installed
in the courtyard of a house, the owner of the house would keep a list of
users and collect the money periodically.   Experience in all communities
where water systems are in operation has shown that the overdue accounts
are nil except in five communities (Table 7.2). This is basically because
of the high level of community participation and cooperation resulting
lrom SENASA's educational and promotional programs.
1/ Annex 3 contains details on the tariff structure.



- 35 -
7.20      The system of setting and reviewing tariffs is considered satis-
factory.   Assurances were obtained during negotiations  (para.  9.02  (j))
that: (a) the system will be continued unless SENASA and the Bank otherwise
agree; (b) SENASA and the communities will at least once a year review the
tariff levels; and (c) SENASA will cause the Sanitary Committees to take all
necessary measures to produce revenues sufficient to comply with the revenue
covenant.
Future Finances of Beneficiary Villages
7.21      Financial  projections  for  1983-87  have  been  prepared  for  two
representative villages.   The basic information on expected revenues and
costs were taken from the villages' financial statements most recently
sent to SENASA.   The projections and basic assumptions  are presented in
Annex 4.  It is important to note that after the systems are delivered to
the communities, the Committees should be able to cover operating and
maintenance expenses from system revenues. In later years, the Committees
should be able to finance other investments, such as extension and normal
repairs  from  their  operating  incomes.   The  financial  positions  of  the
Committees as measured by their abilities to comply with the revenue
covenant is satisfactory.
Monitoring Indicators
7.22      SENASA provided the Bank with assurances (para. 9.02 (1)), that in
order to ensure satisfactory project monitoring, SENASA will establish a
system of monitoring indicators and execution targets on the basis of the
indicators set forth in Annex 5.
VIII. SOCIOECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Project Rationale
8.01      The project aims at alleviating the precarious living and health
conditions of the inhabitants of about 49 rural communities located in the
most rapidly developing area of the country by providing safe water supply
and sanitation facilities. The late start of sector activities in Paraguay,
as explained in Chapter II, has resulted in a failure of basic public
services to keep pace with the the rapid development of productive
activities. This in turn has impaired gains in labor productivity and access
of the low-income rural population to the benefits of economic growth.



- 36 -
8.02       The project also aims at continuing to strengthen SENASA's ability
to execute projects, effectively promote community participation during
construction and train the villagers to operate and maintain the systems once
they are completed.  This aspect of the project is particularly important as
SENASA is significantly increasing its activities in rural areas and will
have to continue doing so in order to successfully meet with its sector
objectives.
Population Benefited and Poverty Impact
8.03      The project would provide safe water through house or courtyard
connections to about 60,000 inhabitants of 49 rural communities by 1985.
Most of the remaining 20% of the inhabitants of these communities would
receive water through public standpipes.   The project would also provide
sanitary units to about 11,000 inhabitants and latrines to about 28,000
inhabitants in the same communities by 1985.
8.04      A recent survey estimated that in 1977, about 56% of Paraguay's
rural population earned an annual per capita income of less than 020,000
(US$160). It was also estimated that on-farm consumption represented about
45% of annual monetary income. This poverty threshold expressed in terms of
monetary income would be equivalent to about 25% of the national per capita
income for the same year.  Based on the USAID study, complemented by more
recent information gathered by SENASA in some of the project communities, it
is estimated that about 60% of the families belong to the poverty target
group. About 20% earned between 020,001 and 040,000 per capita (US$160), and
20% earned more than 040,000 per capita. These income distribution indica-
tors have been corroborated by other poverty indicators, such as access to
basic services, housing quality and household possessions.
8.05      About 40% (24,000 people) of those who would benefit  from the
water subprojects through house or courtyard connections are estimated to
belong to the poverty group, as do all of the beneficiaries through public
standpipes.  One hundred percent of the population to be benefited by the
provision of latrines also belong to the poverty group.
8.06      The project would also have income distribution effects,  since
about half of the  families without access  to public 3supplies   purchase
water from private vendors at prices of up to 01,000/m  (US$8/m ).  These
consumers are presently spending more than 018,000 a year, or more than 12%
poverty group, for provision of limited and unsafe water.  With the proj-
ect, they will have access to larger volumes of safe water at a family
expenditure of up to 06,000 a year, or about 4% of the annual income
poverty  threshold.    Another  significant  part  of  the  dwellers  lacking
access to public water supplies has to walk distances of up to 2-2 km to
carry water. This causes one or two persons of the household to be unable
to earn outside income or, in the case of children, to obtain an education.



- 37 -
Quantification of Benefits
8.07      The economic return on investment was not quantified because of
the impossibility of assigning a monetary value to health benefits stemming
from the project. However, to obtain at least an approximate value for the
level below which the economic rate of return is not likely to lie, a
calculation was made for two villages (of 8,000 and 2,800 inhabitants) of the
present  value  of  capital  and  operating  costs,  including  complementary
investments for a 10-year period, at an 11% discount rate, corresponding to
the approximate opportunity cost of capital.  In both cases, the net present
value would be positive on the assumption that consumers assign a value equal
to what they are now paying to vendors--or half that amount when they are
carrying their water from nearby sources--for volumes consumed at present,
and a value equal to 015/m3 for additional consumption. These sample calcu-
lations suggest that even without computing the value of public health and
other benefits, the economic rate of return of the project is likely to
exceed the opportunity cost of capital in Paraguay.
8.08      The latrine component of the proposed project is justifiable in
terms of its low cost and the health hazards it would help reduce.   The
beneficiaries of the sanitary unit component of the project would fully repay
the costs in three to five years; the only element of subsidy would be the
subsidized interest rate. Populations of similar rural comunities included
in the project financed under Loan 1502-PA have already demonstrated their
willingness to pay by signing the onlending agreements, purchasing the local
materials and providing labor.
Affordability of Project Services
8.09      Water services provided by the project are estimated to be fully
affordable to the village populations. The lowest income inhabitants (about
20%) will have access to public standpipes at a token cost. The monthly bill
for low-income populations having access to a courtyard connection (0500 or
US$4) would not exceed 4% of the minimum monthly salary (0132,000) or 4% of
the monthly poverty income monetary threshold at December 1980 prices. 1/
Materials and technical assistance for the installation of latrines would be
provided free of charge. The cost of the foreign component of each sanitary
unit is estimated at US$120 in December 1980 prices. The purchaser must buy
the local materials and provide the labor. 2/ It is estimated, on the basis
of the experience gained in the project financed under Loan 1502-PA, that
these sanitary units would be affordable to about 20% of the communities'
families.
Project Risks
8.10      The main risk is related to the still limited implementation capa-
bilities of SENASA. The project has been prepared to reduce these risks to a
reasonable level by providing a strong technical assistance program.   In
addition, the project has been scheduled to avoid overlapping with the proj-
ect under Loan 1502-PA.
1/ If on-farm consumption is added to the monetary income, the percentage
to be paid for water is less than 3. of the total monthly family income.
2/ The cost of the local component and hired labor is estimated at US$250 at
TYecember 1980 prices.

Water Tariffs
1.        Tariff levels and structures in villages served by SENASA are
based on financial needs and are established for each village using the
same methodology.   They are always agreed upon by SENASA and the local
Sanitation Committee.
2.        Tariff levels are determined according to the funds necessary to
keep systems operating properly and the villagers' ability to pay. Ability
to pay is estimated on the basis of the socio-economic surveys carried out
by SENASA for every village. The revenues are estimated on the basis of:
(a) operating and routine maintenance costs, labor, fuel or
electiricty, lubricants, spare parts, office supplies, com-
munications, and miscellaneous;
(b) contributions to the replacement funds for major or extra-
ordinary repairs or replacement of worn out parts, cal-
culated on the basis of the economic life of equipment and
parts subject to more frequent replacement (usually pumps,
motors, and related equipment); and
(c) debt service to be repaid to SENASA, varying according to
initial community contribution, ability to pay, and system
size, but never less than the one corresponding to a debt
equivalent to 10% of the subproject cost.
3.        For the purpose of determining tariff levels, SENASA has pre-
pared the following table in which a weight (Unidades) is assigned to every
sanitary fixture:
Fixture                            Units
Domestic lavatory                                    6
Public lavatory                                     12
Domestic water sealed toilet                        10
Public water sealed toilet                          18
Domestic shower                                     14
Public shower                                       20
Patio faucet only                                   24
Patio faucet with hose connection                    7
Patio  Eaucet if others exist in the house           4
Kitchen faucet                                       5
Kitchen faucet for restaurants                      10

In most cases, there would be three residential categories: (a) up to 25
units as a basic charge; (b) up to 41 units; and (c) more than 41 units.
The first category corresponds to dwellings with only one courtyard
faucet.   The second category includes dwellings with complete sanitary
units. The third category includes relatively high-income consumers, with
more sanitary facilities.   Commercial consumers will be charged 50% in
excess of the third category residential charges. A fixed charge for use
of standpipes would be also set up (para. 7.17).
4.        Tariff  levels  are revised  every year with the assistance of
SENASA to keep them adequate to meet the financial needs of the system.
The present tariff structure is designed with a certain degree of pro-
gressivity. This allows a reasonable amount of cross-subsidization.
