1.     The proposed additional financing to the Republic of Peru for USD20.0 million, to be added to the
Lima Water Rehabilitation and Management Project (Loan 3811-PE). This additional financing would be
under Fixed Spread Loan terms with a maturity of 16 years, and would enable the Government to bring first
time water and sanitation services to 130,000 of the urban poor in low-income areas of Lima (pueblos
jdvenes), thereby completing the service expansion component of the original project.
L. Country/Sector Background
2.     The USD150 million loan for the Lima Water Rehabilitation and Management Project was
approved by the Board on November 22, 1994. The estimated total project cost at appraisal was USD306
million, including USD76 million from the JBIC (ex-OECF) and USD80 from SEDAPAL's own resources.
The project became effective on August 31, 1995 and has received either satisfactory or highly satisfactory
ratings during the course of its implementation. The original closing date of June 30, 2001, was extended
twice by a total of one and half years as a direct result of an IMF Agreement that imposed annual
investment ceilings on all public agencies and consequently retarded project execution during the last three
years. More recently, the amended closing date of December 31St 2002, has been extended by a further six
months to allow for the submission of this request for additional financing. Under the proposed additional
financing, the closing date would be extended to December 315t 2006 to enable SEDAPAL to complete the
activities under Part C of the Project.
3.     The project had the following main objectives: (a) rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation
networks and of water wells; (b) promotion of water conservation through metering, conjunctive use of
groundwater and surface water; (c) expansion of services to the urban poor in low income areas of Lima
(pueblos j6venes); and (d) institutional support to improve SEDAPAL's performance in terms of efficiency,
service quality and financial sustainability. The project has largely met or exceeded the targets that were
originally set, as illustrated in the table below.
Actual 1994  Actual 2001  SAR Target
(A) Network rehabilitatwn
* Physical water losses (%)                           31         16'         29

* Continuity of supply (systemwide average hours per day)  11.5  20.0        Na.
Notes: Asterisk indicates that SAR targets were met or exceeded.
4.     Under the network rehabilitation component, the full range of refurbishment activities have been
completed, leading to a reduction in physical water losses from 31% to 22%. SEDAPAL has also
implemented a program for leak detection with 6 mobile units and has completed the survey of 8,000 km of
pipes. As a result, water availability has increased substantially from an average of 11.5 hours per day in
1995 to 20.0 hours per day in 2001, system-wide.

5.     Under the water conservation component, the customer cadastre has been completed for all districts,
and more than 700,000 new domestic water meters have been installed with the renovation and/or
construction of the water meter boxes, raising meter coverage from 3% in 1994 to 68% in 2001. A voluntary
inspection program to detect in-house leaks has proven very popular and is contributing to major savings in
water supply. According to preliminary results, the combined effect of various conservation activities has
resulted in a saving of up to seven cubic meters per second of water (of which 5.7 cubic meters per second
comes from the installation of meters, and 1.3 cubic meters per second from the detection of leaks). These
additional resources have been made available to districts that did not receive sufficient water in the past.

6.     The objective of the service expansion component was to expand and improve services to 600,000
residents of the pueblos j6venes; providing improved service to 300,00 and first time service to a further
300,000. Since regulations in place at the time did not permit SEDAPAL to build the secondary distribution
networks in the pueblos j6venes, responsibility for achieving this key objective of the original Bank project
was divided between SEDAPAL and FONAVI. SEDAPAL would undertake the extension of the trunk
water mains towards the pueblos j6venes, financed under the service expansion component of the Bank
project, at a total cost of USD40 million or 27% of the original project value. Meanwhile, the secondary
networks needed to connect the primary infrastructure to the local residents, were separately funded by the
housing finance agency, FONAVI, which lent money to local residents who then contracted the construction
of the works. Through this mechanism, services were extended to 170,000 local residents, until FONAVI
was dissolved in 2000 (due to an accumulation of around USD1 billion of bad debts), and was therefore no
longer able to provide financing to the remaining 130,G00 residents that had originally been targeted for
first-time service under the project. As a result, only about 60% of the original target population has been
served, while SEDAPAL has been left with significantly under-utilized capacity in the corresponding
primary networks. Although the service expansion objective of the component in question was clear, the
accompanying component description agreed with the Peruvian authorities was not explicit as to the
inclusion of secondary networks construction among the specific project activities (but was explicit as to the
primary networks construction). The additional financing amendment currently proposed for Board
approval remedies this situation by clearly adding such secondary networks construction to the component
description, thus fully spelling out all the elements (primary and secondary) needed, and always intended, to
meet the original expansion objective.

7.     Under the institutional support component, SEDAPAL has made major strides in raising efficiency,
service quality and financial sustainability. This has been achieved through a wide variety of initiatives such
as the adoption of: (i) improved management systems, including Activity Based Costing (ABC), the Open
SGC billing software, the SAP R/3 system for financial and human resource management, a Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system enabling centralized tele-control of 200 points throughout
the network, a GIS system incorporating digitalization of the network; (ii) improved accountability for
performance, via the signature of annual management agreements between the company and its oversight
agencies MIPRE, SUNASS, and FONAFE, the introduction of performance based pay for staff, and the
adoption of voluntary benchmarking against leading utilities in the region; (iii) a cost-reflective tariffpolicy,
that has seen the average tariff increase by 44% in real terms over the life of the project, and the tariff
structure simplified and rationalized to remove excessive cross-subsidies between customer groups.
8.     The need for additional finance to complete the service expansion component of the project was
first discussed as early as mid-2000. However, due to the political uncertainties that faced the country since
that period and the frequent changes in the Vice Ministers responsible for the sector, the official request was
delayed until November 8b 2002.
9.     During recent CAS discussions in April 2002, the Government indicated that the expansion of water
and sanitation services in the pueblos jovenes of Lima is now the highest priority policy objective for the
water sector. Indeed, increasing access to safe water is one of the six Millennium Development Goals
(MDG) that have been targeted by the Government and highlighted in the recent CAS, under the "Equity
and Social Justice" pillar.
II. Justification for Additional IBRD Financing
10.    Additional financing is justified on the following grounds.
a) Cost over-run. A strict reading of OP/BP13.20 limits the application of the supplemental financing
instrument to cases of cost over-runs. While no cost over-run has occurred in this case, the situation
is nonetheless a very similar one in that a funding shortfall has arisen for reasons beyond the control
of the Borrower. This has had the same effect of creating a financing gap that prevents the original
service coverage objectives of the project from being reached. Following clearances from both the
Regional Vice-President and the Vice-President of OPCS, this request is therefore nonetheless
submitted under procedures analogous to those for supplemental financing. As detailed below,
adherence to the standard notion (based on OP/BP 13.20) that additional financing for operations
can only be sought through the supplemental financing route, would mean that there was no
instrument available for responding promptly to the financing shortfall in this project. Given that
such a result could jeopardize the developmental objectives of the project, the Board is asked to
approve the current request not as "supplemental" financing but as "additional" financing outside
the scope of OP/BP 13.20.
b) Achievement of original project objectives. The project has only met 60% of its original expansion
targets for water and sanitation services, with 130,000 people in the originally targeted pueblos
j6venes remaining unserved. This was due to the bankruptcy of FONAVI, the agency that was
originally intended to provide financing for the secondary networks.
c) Feasibility of reducing project scope. Moreover, unless additional financing is made available a
significant proportion of the original USD40 million of Bank resources that have already been
devoted to the expansion of primary networks will be substantially under-utilized due to the absence
of secondary networks to connect them to the homes of the intended beneficiaries.

d) Availability of otherfinancing. This avenue has been explored without yielding results. Financing
that exists from other sources (JBIC and CAF) for the construction of secondary networks is already
committed for specific pueblos jdvenes that do not coincide with the areas where the Bank project
has provided support, and cannot be reallocated to those areas.
e) Time available for processing free standing loan. The Government has asked that processing take
place as rapidly as possible, as the conditions in the pueblos jovenes continue to deteriorate and the
number of households without service has increased rapidly. The VMCS has repeatedly declared
that its number one priority for the coming years is to eliminate the water and sanitation coverage
deficit in peri-urban Lima. The use of a new lending operation to meet the objectives envisaged for
the original operation would be an unnecessarily slow and inefficient route, involving substantial
documentation requirements and additional budgetary resources. Given that the preparation work
was already completed under the original operation, the efforts associated with a new operation do
not seem to be the best way to use scarce Bank budget and staff resources.
f) Borrower commitment and capacity. The VMCS has already provided clear evidence of a strong
political commitment to the project. Moreover, SEDAPAL has amply demonstrated its
implementation capacity by reaching or exceeding the project targets for those components that fell
directly under its control.
111. Project Objectives
11.   The objective of the additional financing will be to meet the original objectives for service
expansion to the pueblos jdvenes by extending water and sanitation services to an additional 130,000
people.
IV. Project Description
12.   The proposed additional financing would provide resources to finance the expansion of water and
sanitation services to the pueblos j6venes located in the area of influence of the primary networks that were
already financed under Part C of the original project (Service Expansion Component). The total cost will be
USD37.1 million; of which USD20.0 million would be financed under the loan, USD9.4 million would be
co-financed by SEDAPAL, and USD7.7 million would be co-financed by beneficiary households (through
both cash and labor contributions). As envisaged in the original project, these services would benefit the
Districts of Carabayllo, Comas, and Puente Piedra, in the northern cone of the city, the Districts of Villa
Maria del Triunfo and Villa El Salvador in the southern cone of the city, and the Districts of Ate-Vitarte and
San Juan de Lurigancho in the eastern cone of the city. The works would be executed within a three and a
half year period, extending the closing date of the project to December 31st, 2006. Further details can be
found in the joint VMCS and SEDAPAL Feasibility Study, which was approved by the authorities on 31st
December 2002.
13.   The expansion of services under the additional finance would continue to follow the general
procedures described in Annex 17 of the Staff Appraisal Report, while incorporating the lessons of
experience during project implementation to date, as well as recent international experiences in the design
of water and sanitation projects for low income communities. A facilitator (generally an NGO) would be
used to promote the project in the beneficiary communities, assist in the formation of a community water
and sanitation Committee, and support the communities in selecting an appropriate technological solution,
understanding the cost implications, and developing a detailed design of the selected solution. Thereafter the



Peru - Proposed Additional Financing                                                5
execution of the works would be tendered to a contractor, and supervised by the facilitator. Depending on
the nature of the system, and the wishes of the community, the Committee could take over some or all
aspects of subsequent operation and maintenance, but always with appropriate technical support from
SEDAPAL. A formal Community agreement would always be signed between SEDAPAL and the water
and sanitation committee at the beginning of the process, to clarify the roles and responsibilities of both
parties.
14.    To accommodate the differing economic, topographical, and urban characteristics of the beneficiary
communities, the project would offer a choice based on different levels of service differentiated by cost. In
terms of water, this would mean either a private tap in the household or a public tap designed to serve
groups of 10 dwellings. Irrespective of the choice made by the community about the final level of service,
SEDAPAL would build a secondary distribution network capable of supporting individual private
connections for all households, to ensure that the community would have the option of eventually upgrading
as its economic circumstances improve. In terms of sanitation, the communities would again be offered a
choice between ventilated dry pit latrines, or appropriately designed sewerage networks. The project would
make use of innovative technologies designed to reduce the cost of providing water and sanitation services
in low income communities, including the condominial approach. This approach is more fully described in
the recent Water and Sanitation Program publication entitled Condominial Water and Sewerage Systems.
15.    Based on recent project experience, an indicative ceiling of US$1,080 per household (including
both water and sanitation and net of value added tax) would be applied for finance from the project.
Communities wishing to adopt more expensive water and sanitation solutions would be free to do so as long
as they were willing and able to finance the incremental costs themselves. In general, households wishing to
make a private connection would be expected to finance the cost of connecting their dwelling to the
distribution network. This is estimated to cost US$170 per household, of which 60% could be covered by
labor contributions.
16.    Under the financing arrangements of the original project, households took on loans from FONAVI
to cover the cost of building the secondary networks, and paid back the loans through additional charges
levied on their water bills; with SEDAPAL effectively acting as a debt collector on behalf of FONAVI.
With the disappearance of FONAVI, under this proposed extension, SEDAPAL would take on the loan
required to finance the secondary networks, and recover the costs of servicing the loan through the general
tariff paid by all water customers in Lima, including those in the pueblos jdvenes.
V. Project Implementation
17.    Project implementation arrangements will remain the same as in the original project, with
SEDAPAL overseeing project implementation through its Project Implementation Unit. The project
implementation manual, suitably updated, will continue to be used as the support for all project procedures.
18.   Financial management. The project implementation unit has a satisfactory track record in financial
management and has the capacity to provide the Bank with accurate and timely information regarding
resources and expenditures. Country specific risk has been assessed as moderate due to robust financial
administration legislation, highly trained and dedicated staff in financial management posts and an
integrated financial management system at national level. Entity specific and control risks are also
moderate.
19.   Auditors' reports of recent years have issued unqualified opinions on SEDAPAL's financial
statements and project accounts, with SEDAPAL taking prompt action to address auditors'
recommendations on specific areas of improvement.

20.    The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in SEDAPAL would continue to maintain detailed project
accounts, utilizing the existing code of accounts that permits the accumulation of costs by project cost
category and component. Financial Statements, prepared on the cash basis, will follow National Norms
which are acceptable to the Bank. In addition to monthly financial statements, the PIU will prepare quarterly
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) comprising Project Financial Statements, physical progress and
procurement sections. The Annual Financial Statements will include: (i) the Statement of Receipts and
Payments by Funding Source (with expenditures classified by budgetary line and/or disbursement category);
(ii) Uses of Funds by Project Activities (including budget comparison); and (iii) the Special Account
Reconciliation Statement.
21.    Supporting documentation would be maintained by SEDAPAL and made available to Bank
missions and independent auditors as required. The Project Accounts, Special Account, and use of the SOEs
would continue to be audited annually in accordance with Terms of Reference by auditors acceptable to the
Bank. Audit reports would be submitted to the Bank no later than six (6) months after the close of the
Government's fiscal year.
22.    Procurement. Current project procurement arrangements will be maintained, including twice yearly
reviews of procurement plans and an annual ex post procurement review. The Project Implementation Unit
has continuously updated its procurement procedures in line with evolving Bank guidelines since 1994, and
currently conducts procurement of works, goods and consultant services in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement (dated January 1995, revised January and August 1996, September 1997 and
January 1999), and the Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants by Borrowers of the World
Bank (dated January 1997, revised September 1997, January 1999 and May 2002). A detailed procurement
plan has been developed for the activities covered under this additional financing.

21.    Disbursement. The proceeds of the proposed additional financing would be disbursed over a three
and a half year period, and will cover the items indicated in the schedule above. The existing Special
Account in the Banco Wiese Sudameris would be used for the additional financing, with an authorized
allocation of USD2.3 million. Eligible expenditures incurred after January 2nd 2003 may be retroactively
financed up to a maximum equivalent of USD2 million. Disbursements would be made on the basis of
Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) except those covered by contracts requiring the Bank's prior review. The
allocation of loan proceeds and estimated disbursement schedule are summarized in Schedule B.

VI. Project Sustainability
22.    There are two important issues regarding the sustainability of project investment: (i) the financial
sustainability of the water utility SEDAPAL; and (ii) the on-going operation and maintenance of the water
and sanitation services in the pueblos jovenes in cases where a communal solution has been adopted (such
as public stand pipes).
23.    During the period of implementation of the original project, SEDAPAL has made considerable
strides in improving its financial sustainability. According to new regulations issued in 1995, all Peruvian
water utilities are required by law to gradually raise their tariffs to levels compatible with economic and
financial sustainability. SEDAPAL has already increased tariffs by 44% in real terms, from USD0.29 per
cubic meter at the outset of the project in 1994 to USD0.42 per cubic meter in 2001. According to the
regulatory agency SUNASS, these levels are consistent with long-run average cost, defined to include both
operating and capital expenditures. As of 2002, the company had sound financial indicators as indicated in
the Schedule H. Moreover, SEDAPAL will report annually to the Bank on its operational and financial
performance and has committed to meeting the targets laid down in Schedule H.
24.    The sustainability of any communal services (such as public stand pipes) provided to the pueblos
j6venes will be addressed by the creation of community water and sanitation Commnittees. The Committees
will take varying degrees of responsibility for managing, operating, and maintaining the secondary
networks, billing the local community and paying SEDAPAL for the bulk supply of water, depending on the
nature of the systems installed and the preferences of the community. This institutional model has been
applied with considerable success in other pueblos j6venes, because it builds on the relatively high levels of
social capital and organizational capacity that exist within these neighborhoods. Nevertheless, experience
has shown that it is desirable to back-up these Committees with technical support from SEDAPAL,
including regular site visits to identify any problems with the operation of the system. SEDAPAL has
established a special internal unit for this purpose, and formal agreements will be signed between
SEDAPAL and the Committees to clarify the commitments and obligations of both parties.
VII. Poverty Category
25.    The project clearly qualifies as a program of targeted interventions to the poor, given that all the
resources would be dedicated to financing the expansion of water and sanitation services in low-income
areas of Lima. The typical family income in the pueblos jo'venes ranges between USD130 to USD180 per
month, equivalent to less than USD1 per capita per day, and it has been estimated that around two thirds of
the family budget is spent on meeting basic nutritional requirements.
26.    Currently, 1.1 million people in these areas lack access to safe water, and 1.3 million lack access to
basic sanitation. The absence of adequate water and sanitation services exacts a heavy burden from these
families. Most of them currently pay around USD2.00 per cubic meter for water from tankers; about eight
times the price charged by SEDAPAL for piped water, and are often forced to carry the water across
considerable distances and gradients from the tanker supply points to their homes. As a result, water
consumption is very low (15 to 30 liters per capita per day), and the water consumed is often unsafe, leading
to a high incidence of diarrhea and cholera in the metropolitan area. The project would ensure that these
families receive potable water, and allow them to raise their consumption towards 50 liters per capita per
day. Moreover, the project would provide hygienic low cost sanitation, for families that currently have no
alternative for safe disposal of wastewater.

VIII. Environmental Aspects
27.    The original project is classified as Category B under the Bank's environmental guidelines, and an
Environmental Impact Assessment incorporating the service expansion component (Part C) was carried out
at the time of appraisal. The additional financing is also categorized as a B, as no major environmental
impacts are expected. The only issues that arise are those associated with the construction of the works. To
mitigate this effect, all publics works contracts issued by SEDAPAL will incorporate environmental
guidelines for constructors; which is in any case the standard practice of the company. The guidelines
include rules on chance archeological finds, disposal of construction waste in pre-approved landfills,
communication with local communities, pedestrian safety, dust and noise abatement measures, etc. These
guidelines were reviewed by Bank environmental specialists, and will be disclosed to the public as part of
the project documentation. Although expansion of wastewater service to the poor areas is expected to lead
to an increase in waste water collection, the incremental amount is negligible; no more than 0.1 cubic meters
per second, relative to total flows of 20 cubic meters per second for the city as a whole. Overall, the project
has significant positive environmental impacts by improving sanitary conditions in the pueblos jdvenes.
IX Participatory Approach
28.    Building on best practice for peri-urban water and sanitation projects, SEDAPAL would continue to
use a highly participatory approach to service extension, with direct involvement of beneficiaries at each
stage of the project cycle. All community interactions would be intermediated by community facilitators, a
number of which have acquired valuable experience in community mobilization for water and sewerage
projects, under a number of previous initiatives in the pueblos j6venes. The local municipalities would also
be closely involved, and their participation will be critical both in facilitating the public works, and
supporting the legal titling process for beneficiary households, half of which do not currently have legal
tenure of their dwellings.
X. Project Benefits
29.    The project would lead to substantial welfare benefits for the residents of the pueblos j6venes, who
will see the price of water fall from USD2.00 to USD0.25 per cubic meter, enabling them to increase
consumption from the current subsistence level of 30 liters per capita per day. Based on existing experience,
households receiving public taps would be expected to raise their consumption to 50 liters per capita per
day, while those receiving private taps may consume in excess of 100 liters per capita per day. Associated
with this additional consumption, there are significant health benefits in terms of reduced incidence of
diarrhea and cholera, these have been estimated at around USD13 per capita per year on the basis of avoided
medical costs and lost wages.
30.    A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of the service expansion component was performed in the
original Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), and was recently updated with the actual tumout data. In line with
original estimations, the intemal rate of return has proved to be of the order of 40% and the benefit-cost
ratio of 2.4. Estimates recently produced by the Peruvian govemment for the services to be funded from this
additional financing produce intemal rates of return of 30-40% for household connections, and 17% for
public standpipes. The benefit-cost ratio estimates range from 1.7 to 2.6 depending on the chosen
technology.

XI. Risks
31.    There are a number of risks associated with the implementation of the project. (i) SEDAPAL has
not traditionally been involved in extending secondary networks into the pueblos j6venes, since they were
prevented from doing so by past regulations. However, SEDAPAL has recently acquired new experience of
working in this environment through a number of donor initiatives to extend services to the pueblos j6venes.
(ii) There is a risk that communities may reject the water and sanitation solutions proposed by the project.
This risk is mitigated by survey work designed to understand community and individual preferences and
attitudes to these services. Moreover, communities would be offered a variety of service options, and will be
supported by community facilitators through the process of reaching a decision.

Glossary of Monitoring Indicators
Service Quality Indicators
Continuity of Supply is the water availability measured as the average hours per day with water
supply.
Operational Indicators
Water Service Coverage is the estimated number of people in the Lima metropolitan area served
by SEDAPAL's water services on December 31 of year t divided by the estimated number of
people living in SEDAPAL's service area on December 31 of year t.
Sewerage Service Coverage is the estimated number of people in the Lima metropolitan area
served by SEDAPAL's sewerage services on December 31 of year t divided by the estimated
number of people living in SEDAPAL's service area on December 31 of year t.
Water Connections Billed by Metering as Percentage of Total Water Connections is
calculated as the total number of SEDAPAL's water connections with a working meter that is
read for billing divided by the total number of SEDAPAL's water connections.
Unaccounted-for-water is calculated as a percentage of the volume of water produced in year t
less the volume of water billed in year t divided by the total volume of water produced in year t.
Number of permanent employees per 1,000 water connections is calculated by dividing
SEDAPAL's total number of permanent employees on December 31 of year t by the total number
of operating water connections on December 31 of year t.
Financial Indicators
Average Operating Revenues are calculated as the total operating revenues in year t divided by
the volume of water billed in year t. The average operating revenue per cubic meter billed is
recalculated in U.S. dollars by using the average U.S. dollar exchange rate in year t.
Total Average Water and Sewerage Tariff is equal to SEDAPAL's water and sewerage
revenue (including monthly fixed charge known as "pension basica") in year t divided by the
volume of water billed in year t. The average water tariff is then recalculated in U.S. dollars per
cubic meter using the average U.S. dollar exchange rate in year t.
Average Water and Sewerage Tariff is equal to SEDAPAL's water and sewerage revenue
(excluding monthly fixed charge known as "pension basica") in year t divided by the volume of
water billed in year t. The average water tariff is then recalculated in U.S. dollars per cubic meter
using the average U.S. dollar exchange rate in year t.
Real Increase in water and Sewerage Tariff is equal to average water and sewerage tariff in
year t (in Soles/n3) divided by average water and sewerage tariff in year t-l (in Soles/m3). This
result is divided by the inflation index in year t. The average tariff taken for this calculation does
not include the monthly fixed charge (or "pension basica).

Average Operating Costs are calculated as the operating costs (without depreciation) in year t
divided by the volume of water billed in year t. The average operating costs per cubic meter
billed is recalculated in U.S. dollars using the average U.S. dollar exchange rate in year t.
Working Ratio is calculated as the operating costs (excluding depreciation) in year t divided by
the operating revenues in year t.
Operating Ratio is calculated as the operating costs (including depreciation) in year t divided by
the operating revenues in year t.
Accounts Receivable Comparator is calculated by multiplying the accounts receivable
(including provision for bad debts) by 360 days and dividing this product by SEDAPAL's
operating revenues. This indicator is expressed in days.
Debt Service Coverage is the intemally generated flow of funds (the sum of net income after tax
in year t, depreciation in year t, interest payments in year t and, if applicable, the monetary
correction in year t) divided by the debt service payment in year t (amortization and interest of
long-term debt).
Internal Cash Generation as a percentage of investment is defined as the cash flow from
operations (the sum of net income after tax, depreciation, interest payment and, if applicable, the
monetary corrections) less the sum of interest during construction, the increase in working
capital, and the debt service payments in year t. This total is then divided by SEDAPAL's total
investment (investments related to both the Bank-financed project and SEDAPAL's regular
investment program) excluding interest during construction.
