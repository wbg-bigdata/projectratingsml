GUADALUPE IV HYDRO POWER PROJECT
1. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Colombia's main indigenous commercial energy resources are hydro-
power, coal, gas and oil. Potential hydropower appears to be the most
promising at some 100 GW of capacity and 250-300 TWh of annual energy
capability, as shown by the preliminary investigations made by the Govern-
ment. Colombia is also endowed with very large coal and gas deposits.
Over 1970-77 crude oil output declined at an average rate of 6.5%/a. Over
the same period, consumption of petroleum products increased by 5.5%/a.
As a result, Colombia, since 1977, is a net importer of crude oil and pros-
pects are for imports to rise sharply in the early 1980s unless additional
reserves are discovered and developed quickly. Measures are being taken to
deal with this problem and to develop alternative energy sources. In the case
of coal, there have been various obstacles to more adequate utilization of
the existing potential: low prices compared with those prevailing on inter-
national markets, the competition of low-priced petroleum, fragmentation
of production among a large number of very small mines with low output and
productivity levels, and lack of efficient marketing and transport infrast-
ructure. However, the Government is currently taking action to address these
problems (1.03). With respect to natural gas, a previous decline in known
reserves and output has been dramatically reversed with the discovery of
large depos 1s ie the Atlantic Coast region. These reserves (estimated at
over 5 x 10   ft ) will provide energy and petrochemical feedstock to this
rapidly industrializing region.
1.02      Production of primary energy during 1965-77 (see table next page)
has not kept pace with overall economic expansion.  It incre2sed only
3.6%/a during 1965-7y, when it reached its peak at 690 x 10 . Btu, and then
declined to 637 x 10   Btu in 1977, mainly due to falling crude oil output.
In contrast to the declining energy output, final energy consumption grew
by 8.9%/a during 1965-70, and 8.5%/a during 1971-73, when economic growth was
high and energy prices declined sharply in real terms. During 1974-77, the
economic downturn and increase in real energy prices had a dampening effect
on consumption, which now has settled at a growth of about 4.5%/a compared
with a GDP growth of some 6%/a in recent years.
1.03      The Government's development strategy is aimed at achieving a
more favorable balance between domestic energy supply and use, by increased
utilization of domestic sources which are in abundant supply, i.e. hydro-
power, natural gas and coal. The Government is planning a large-scale develop-
ment of high grade coal deposits for export to help offset oil imports by

high priority to developing for export the thermal coal deposits at El Cerrejon
(reserves 600 Mt and production target 10 Mt/a) near Riohacha in the department
of La Guajira on the Atlantic Coast under CARBOCOL's responsibility in coopera-
tion with foreign investment. The Government also intends to step up surveys
of identified coal fields in the departments of Santander and Antioquia and to
study the feasibility of using low grade coal for firing large thermal plants
required in the early nineties when potential hydro sites are expected to be
increasingly more costly to develop (1.27). Small private firms which own coal
mines are pursuing plans to expand output in order to supply fuel for heat
intensive industrial processes and both in-plant and public power generation.
In order to expand potentially viable mines, a well-coordinated Government
program is needed to provide a more rational price structure, improvements in
mine safety, credit facilities and support for marketing and infrastructure.
Such a program would need substantial technical and capital assistance from
abroad. The Bank has been providing guidance to the Government in the prepara-
tion of a proposed coal engineering project, which was pre-appraised in
February 1980, and of the proposed El Cerrejon Project.
1.04      In the hydrocarbon sector, the Government has taken action to stimulate
investment in exploration and field development, which had declined after 1971
because the prices paid to the producers for domestic sales were below economic
value. Currently, the prices paid for oil produced by increasing yields from
existing fields and from new fields have been raised, the latter now being close
to world market levels, and the discriminatory exchange rate for petroleum has
been eliminated. Moreover the Government is encouraging foreign participation
in exploration and development on the basis of association contracts with
ECOPETROL (the Government oil agency). As a result, interest among foreign
petroleum companies to expand or start operations in Colombia has been intensi-
fied and an upturn in exploration has taken place. A Bank petroleum project
is being considered for secondary oil recovery, surveys and follow-up dis-
coveries.
1.05      Plans are underway to explore the country's uranium potential
and the Government has contracted with the French Minatome group for such
exploration. The development of any uranium potential that might exist
would provide the country with another long-term energy option.
Sector Organization
1.06      Electricity is the fastest growing form of energy use in Colombia;
its share in overall energy consumption has grown from 14% in 1960 to 23% in
1978. This process has been assisted by the gradual consolidation of isolated
facilities into regional systems and the interconnection of these systems
to facilitate development of Colombia's low-cost hydro resources. The main
systems are the Central System, covering the interior and the Pacific coast,
and the Atlantic (or Northern) system covering the northern part of the
country. The proposed EPM project is located in the Central System. Also
located in the Central System are the Mesitas (1628-CO) and San Carlos I and
II hydro projects (1582-CO and 1725-CO) for which Bank loans totalling MUS$282
were approved in 1978 and 1979 (Annex 1.1). By 1982/83 a national grid
will have been established with the completion of a 500-kV line interconnect-
ing the Atlantic and the Central systems, for which a Bank loan of MUS$50
(1583-CO) was approved in 1978.

1.07      Public electricity service is presently provided by:
(a)  municipally-owned companies, independent of the Central
Government, of which the largest are Empresa de Energia
Electrica de Bogota (EEEB), Empresas Publicas de Medellin
(EPM), and Empresas Municipales de Cali (EMCALI);
(b)  national enterprises such as Instituto Colombiano de Energia
Electrica (ICEL), and Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Cauca
(CVC), and the Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica
(CORELCA);
(c)  a large number of local subsidiaries of ICEL, CORELCA and
CVC 1/; and
(d)  a generating and transmission company, Interconexion Electrica
S.A. (ISA), the shareholders of which are EEEB, EPM, CVC, ICEL
and CORELCA.
1.08      Colombia has a number of public entities known as Regional Autonomous
Corporations with a range of functions related to development of the regions
under their jurisdiction, including legal capacity to generate, transmit
and distribute electricity. CVC is the largest of these entities. The
Ministry of Mines and Energy owns part of the sector directly through ICEL and
CORELCA. EEEB and EPM, currently the largest utilities, are controlled by
autonomous municipal governments. CVC reports to the National Planning
Department (NPD) as do some other regional development corporations. ISA was
established in 1967 to provide a rational framework for sector development by
interconnecting the systems of its shareholders, thus creating a national grid
capable of sustaining large hydroelectric developments. By pooling their
financial resources through ISA (under the recent Bank loans mentioned above
in 1.06), its shareholders have been able to undertake much larger and more
economical projects than would have been feasible under the previous arrange-
ments for independent growth.
Regulation, Planning and Coordination
1.09      The Ministry of Mines and Energy is charged with formulating a national
policy for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity although
it shares responsibility with the National Planning Department (NPD) in defining
investment priorities. The Ministry, which is responsible for coordinating
and supervising power sector planning, discharges its functions through its
Electric Energy Division. This division is small and does not have the powers
assigned to similar agencies in other countries (issuance of licenses, regula-
tion of tariffs, approval of expansion programs) to enforce its policies and
programs. Public utility retail tariffs (including those for electricity) are
regulated by the Junta Nacional de Tarifas de Servicios Publicos (JNT) which
forms part of the NPD. JNT has customarily approved requests from the companies
for rate increases, but utilities are free to set tariffs at levels lower than
those approved by the Junta and have done so in the past. EPM (as decided by
the Municipal Council) did so during the past year by decreasing the allowed

Governments.



monthly increase of 2.2% to 1.5% for residential consumers and 1.8% for all
other consumers (2.12).  Although the Government cannot enforce its policies
directly on the municipally controlled power companies, a mechanism for
reaching agreement on major issues affecting the sector is provided by ISA, in
which the Government has a major although not controlling intere--.
1.10      Sector planning and coordination have improved markedly in recent
years, as illustrated by the following:
(a) in line with its bylaws, ISA defines the generation and
transmission expansion program for the interconnected system.
On the basis of studies carried out by it and its shareholders,
ISA executes simulation studies and ranks plant in order of
economic merit. After approval by its Board, this becomes the
national expansion program. The bylaws specify that all plants
requiring a joint effort of all its shareholders be constructed,
owned and operated by ISA. Plants of regional interest may be
built by one or several shareholders, subject to ISA's approval
of such regional plants. Under these arrangements, ISA is, in
effect, responsible for an important part of sector regulation
and planning; only a small number of minor utilities which do
not participate directly in ISA and the national enterprises,
other than CVC, are not covered by its decisions. Voting arrange-
ments in ISA have been restructured to require the concurrence of
four of its five major shareholders in all important decisions,
thus protecting the interests of the municipal utilities and
encouraging a positive participation in its deliberations;
(b) as part of the San Carlos I loan, ISA and its shareholders
agreed to prepare and present to the Government and the Bank
for comments by December 31, 1979, a Power Sector Development
Master Plan. This plan is to cover the period 1980-1990 in
detail and 1991-2000 in general terms and consolidate the
programs for generation and transmission expansion. Similarly,
ISA's shareholders undertook, under the coordination of the
Ministry of Mines and Energy, to prepare and present, as part
of ISA's Master Plan, to the Government and the Bank for
comments by December 31, 1979, a 1980-2000 Sector Development
Master Plan for Distribution consolidating all existing and
future programs for distribution and covering the period
1980-1985 in detail. 1/ Overall, the Master Plan is expected
1/   The generation master plan has suffered a delay of at least 6 months.
Moreover, it has become apparent that completion of the distribution
study will be delayed considerably, until end-1980. No Government action
has been taken to coordinate the study and no information has reached the
Bank from ICEL and CVC as to study progress. ISA, however, is engaging
consultants for coordinating the execution of the study and the presenta-
tion of a single report. CORELCA is expected to have soon a draft report
available. EPM's part of the study will not be completed before mid-1980
and EEEB will have the study executed by the same consultants to be
engaged under the recently approved Distribution Project; it would be
completed by end-1980.

to provide a valuable framework for long-range decisions on
sector-financing, pricing and rural electrification which have
in the past been based on partial and uncoordinated information;
(c) as agreed under the San Carlos I loan, a tariff study based on
marginal costing is underway covering the most important supply
areas in the country. With Bank guidance, this study is being
carried out through a committee in which experts from the Govern-
ment, ISA and its shareholders participate;
(d) also under the aegis of San Carlos I, a study is being executed
by consultants to assess the extent and causes of losses in the
main power systems down to the level of distribution with the
objective of identifying and carrying out actions which would
minimize such losses; and
(e) as agreed under the San Carlos II loan, a study on a uniform
system of accounts and financial planning for the sector will
be carried out by consultants with full time participation by
at least one professional from ISA and each of its shareholders.
Present Developments
1.11       In recognition of the power sector's important role in Colombia's
development process, in the mid-1970s the Government and the main power
companies established a framework, the "Sochagota" Agreement, for orderly
and efficient sector expansion. To enable equitable sharing among the regions
of the financial burden of the large investments contemplated, to foster
least-cost development of high priority generating plants, and to assure that
adequate supply from these plants would reach all regions, the Agreement
envisaged that ISA would be responsible for planning, building and owning all
plants of national interest. Since then, ISA has functioned on this basis.
However, in 1979, the shareholders of ISA expressed reservations about the
concentration of almost 70% of planned expansion in generating facilities
through 1985 in the national company and the associated loss of parity among
themselves in relative generating capacity. Another worrisome aspect was
that ISA's construction capacity is nearly fully committed over the next few
years with works in progress (1,910 MW of hydro plant, numerous 230-kV lines
and a 500-kV line). These reservations have given rise to a proposal that the
four plants in ISA's 1980-85 Investment Program (Betania 500 MW, Guavio 1,000
MW, Playas 240 MW and Urra 1,000 MW) be constructed, owned and operated by
individual shareholders. Although these plants represent less than 1% of the
hydroelectric resources that Colombia will develop over the next 20-30 years,
the Government and the Bank feel that a sound pattern of development and use
of the country's electric energy resources should be maintained. In accordance
with this view, the Government has confirmed in principle that (a) ISA would
have ownership of a substantial portion of total sector capacity sufficient to
enable it to function effectively as the planning, coordinating and future
dispatch agency for the national system, (b) the regions would continue to
share, through investments in ISA, in the cost and benefits of relatively



- 7 -
low-cost hydro-electric resources, which are geographically concentrated in
only a few regions, and (c) viable financing plans would precede the under-
taking of any major plant investments. The Bank has been working closely with
the Government and the companies in defining the specific long-term arrange-
ments that would enable Colombia to make further progress along the lines
reflected in the Sochagota Agreement, while taking due account of the realities
attendant upon the heavy investments planned. It is expected that such
arrangements would be formalized shortly.
1.12      Another matter under discussion between the Government and the Bank
is the rapid growth in overdue payments to ISA by the largely rural-based ICEL,
which depends in part upon national budgetary resources to meet its financial
obligations to ISA (1.34). The Govenment realizes that, if not resolved, this
problem could constrain the sector's development capacity. Thus, in seeking
means to overcome it, it is considering the establishment of an Electricity
Development Fund to finance the sector's expansion (a surtax on electricity
use would be the principal source of revenues of the Fund).
World Bank Participation in the Sector
1.13      Since 1950, the Bank has made 23 loans to Colombia's power sector,
totalling US$769 million (Annex 1.1). In addition, the Bank is currently
supporting rural electrification under the Integrated Rural Development
Project (1532-CO, 1977).
1.14      Between 1973 and 1978 the Bank was unable to participate in sector
development through lending because of institutional and financial difficulties.
The municipal utilities were reluctant to relinquish their independent role in
generation and also experienced severe financial constraints (because of the
Government's reluctance to press for rate increases under inflationary condi-
tions) which reduced the availability of funds to ISA. Decisions on system
expansion required protracted negotiations among the shareholders and the
Government. These negotiations were further complicated by the original
shareholders' reluctance to allow the incorporation of CORELCA into ISA.
Throughout these negotiations, the Bank continued to support the concept of
centralized planning, construction and operation of the national grid and
resisted proposals that would weaken ISA. Because of the time required by
the shareholders to arrive at decisions on these fundamental issues, Bank
consideration of San Carlos I, the 500-kV Interconnection and EEEB's Mesitas
hydroelectric project, all of them urgently needed to avoid power rationing
in Colombia, suffered considerable delays. A solution finally evolved after
extensive discussions between the Bank, the Government and the shareholders,
and four loans were made in 1978 and 1979 (1.06) and one in 1980 (Bogota
Distribution, 1807-CO).
1.15      Overall Bank operations through 1970 have been reviewed by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in 2 reports 1/, which concluded that
Bank financing had been successful in assisting the power companies to develop
1/   "Operations Evaluation Report:  Electric Power" (Report No. Z-17, dated
March 10, 1972) and "Bank Operations in Colombia - An Evaluation" (Report
No. Z-18 dated May 25, 1972).



hydroelectric plants at lower unit cost than they otherwise would have been
able to do. This permitted greater urban coverage as well as cheaper and more
reliable electricity supply to industry. OED also commended Bank efforts in
the establishment of the central interconnected system which facilitated
further power sector development.  In addition, OED identified as important
considerations for possible future loans in the Colombian power sector: the
need to give greater attention to power distribution; the need for improvement
of financial recording and financial planning capabilities; and the need to
give more attention to public utility tariff structures.
1.16      OED additionally reviewed 4 other projects 1/.  The most recent
report (575-CO/681-CO), which pertains to ISA, concludes that the projects
underwent engineering, physical, financial and institutional difficulties.
The estimation of operational and investment requirements for an institution
so financially dependent as ISA, without provision for price contingencies
in an inflationary environment led to severe financial difficulties. The
shareholders had to redefine their role in the sector and, in the process,
execution of the projects was delayed although they were successfully imple-
mented. The experience gained under these projects has had a considerable
impact on the shaping of Bank policy for further lending in Colombia. Adequate
provisions for price contingencies have been introduced; local financing is
being secured through long-term financial commitments of the shareholders to
ISA; improved financial planning was instituted by ISA and its shareholders, as
well as continuous monitoring of their financial performance.
1.17      The recent developments in the sector (1.10) indicate that a rea-
sonable balance between regional and national interest would be maintained,
thus providing a sound basis for continued Bank participation. The further
objectives are in general: coordinated sector planning, efficient organization
and operation, and sound financial management; within the general scope of
these objectives, specific attention in the short term should be given to:
least-cost operations, rational urban and rural distribution developments,
improvement in financial recording and financial planning capabilities and
development of adequate tariff structures and levels based on common concepts
throughout the country.

capita electricity generation was about 667 kWh/a, which is below the average
for Latin America (about 780). Installed capacity at the end of 1978 was
3,930 MW, including self-production. Hydro stations accounted for 69% of
total energy generation. The following table summarizes installed capacity

Public utilities accounted for 94% of total electricity supply; the rest was
provided by self-production. EEEB generated 18%, EPM 19%, CORELCA 14%, CVC 12%,
CEL 13%, and ISA 18% of total supply. Self-suppliers (mainly oil refineries,
petro-chemical plants, steel mills and cement works) owned 6.2% of the country's
installed capacity; most of these plants are also connected to the public
electricity service. The public-service labor force totalled 13,445 at the
end of 1977 when installed capacity was 3,552 MW, including 6,690 manual
workers; this gave ratios of 262 kW/employee and 162 subscribers/employee for
that year.
1.19      Colombia has about 2.3 million electricity subscribers with an
average of 7 beneficiaries per subscriber in an estimated total population
of 25.2 million; 88% of these subscribers are residential, and electricity
service reaches 62% of the population. Studies by the Bank's Development
Policy Staff indicate that Colombia has been able to provide electricity
service to a very high proportion of its urban population (with the connection
rate exceeding 90% in the larger cities). However, only 36% of the families
in small towns (500-2,500 inhabitants) and 16% of other rural families had
service in 1976. Of the electrified municipalities, about 90% have continuous
service, while the remaining have service only during certain hours of the
day. In many towns the quality of the service is unsatisfactory because of
lack of funds which results in poor of maintenance (and large arrears in
payments to the supply companies).

During 1972-78 gross production of electricity increased at an annual average
rate of about 9.5% compared with a GNP growth rate of 6%. Growth of sales,
which averaged 9.2%/a, varied from 7.7%/a for the EPM system to 11.2% for
ICEL's system. Apart from an upward trend in the share of residential consump-
tion, the pattern of supply and demand has not changed materially; the share
of each system in the market has hardly varied. Commerce and industry together
had practically the same share in 1978 as in 1972. The main change is the
increase of the share of residential consumption by 5 percentage points while
"others" declined by 4 percentage points. EMP's historical growth is shown in
paragraph 3.02.

Interconnected System Forecasts
1.22      Demand and Energy.  Projected 1979-85 demand and gross energy
requirements are based on ISA and its shareholders' analysis of past con-
sumption and on a study of the correlation between power sector growth and
growth of GNP. Gross energy requirements in the interconnected system are
expected to increase at an average annual rate of about 10.8%.

Rural Electrification
1.24      About 36% of the population lives in areas classified as rural.
Although most of the rural villages with electricity service are close to the
urban centers, connection density is modest (1.19). The lack of comprehensive
data with respect to ongoing and expected rural electrification efforts is
expected to be remedied through preparation of the Master Plan (1.10).
1.25      Nevertheless, substantial rural electrification programs are currently
underway in a number of regions in the country. Among the most important are:
(a) the ongoing electrification subproject of an Integrated Rural
Development Program supported by IDB, Canadian International
Development Agency and Bank financing (Loan 1352-CO) through
which an estimated 15,000 rural families will acquire electricity
service;



- 12 -
(b) the electrification program in the department of Choco financed
by the Netherlands Government;
(c)  the electrification program in the coffee-growing areas, financed
by coffee sector resources; and
(d) a recently approved IDB rural electrification project for ICEL
which will provide service to about 130,000 households by 1982.
Sector Investment Program and Studies
1.26       The total 1978-85 investment program of ISA and its shareholders
(except for ICEL for which reliable information is not available), excluding
interest during construction in mid 1979 was estimated to amount to about
Col$340 billion in current prices (about US$4.2 billion in mid-1979 prices),
with a foreign component of about 60%. Of the total, 65% pertains to ISA,
16% to EEEB, 9% to CORELCA, 7% to EPM and 3% to CVC. 11 Some 70-75% of total
investments would pertain to generation, which is extremely high (a range of
some 40-60% would be the norm). Because the new generating capacity would be
of little use without a network path to the consumers, upward adjustments in
investments for subtransmission and distribution can be expected and it is
therefore probable that the estimated cost of Col$340 billion is understated.
The Master Plan for power development being prepared by ISA and its share-
holders (1.10) is expected to provide a basis for firmer total investment
estimates. ISA is now regularly updating its study of economic ranking of
projects which indicates that the 1984-88 portion of this program, on which
decisions still have to be taken (the program up to 1984 is being executed),
would be the least-cost alternative for system expansion.
1.27       The introduction of large thermal plant later in the century is
expected to play an important role in ISA's planning for the sector in the
next few years (lead time for mine development and power station construction
may aggregate some 10 years). Even the large hydro potential of some 100 GW
(1.01) would be completely utilized by about year 2020 and the use of the
country's large coal reserves for firing of thermal plant may become more
economic than hydro well before that time. The Government is aware of this
scenario 2/ and the Government agencies involved together with the Bank, are
addressing it. It is expected that the Government will survey, inter alia,
two areas in relation to coal for domestic use: Tasajero in North Santander
and Bolombolo in Antioquia. The use of coal for thermal plant firing and the
substitution of coal for oil would be the primary objectives.

no revised estimate is available awaiting formal arrangements for plant
allocation.

- 1 3 -
1.28      The generation investment program is imposing a heavy financial
burden on ISA and its shareholders. To ensure that only sound projects are
undertaken, assurances have been obtained under the San Carlos loans that
except for plants in the agreed National Expansion Program, ISA and its
shareholders would not undertake construction of any generating plants of
more than 200 MW (ISA) and 100 MW (shareholders) capacity prior to completion
of San Carlos unless satisfactory evidence has been presented to the Bank
that it is economically justified and that adequate financing is available
to carry it out without jeopardizing the project.
Finances and Tariffs
1.29      Except for EEEB and EPM, which have histories of adequate cash
generation, the power sector has relied heavily on borrowings and budgetary
contributions to finance its investments. EEEB and EPM operate low-cost
systems and cover the most affluent markets in the country; they have,
therefore, been able to finance their investments with an appropriate balance
of borrowings and cash generation while charging relatively low rates.
Because there has been no mechanism to obtain financial transfers within the
sector from the more affluent areas to the less affluent, CVC, ICEL and
CORELCA, which operate high-cost systems in lower income areas than EEEB and
EPM, have had to rely on budgetary contributions from the Government and
subsidies. In recent years, however, the opportunity of sharing in low-cost
investments through ISA has provided an indirect transfer mechanism.
1.30      Over most of 1971-77 rate adjustments lagged considerably behind
yearly inflation. The developments were the followings:

2/   On the basis of the consumer price index.
The positive trend in rate setting which began in 1977 is expected to continue
as a result of the agreements reached under the San Carlos I and II, Mesitas
and the Bogota distribution loans and under the proposed loan to EPM. In view
of the importance to economic growth of adequate electricity service, the
Government has adopted a policy calling for adequate rates in order to ensure
that the sector generates internally a reasonable portion of the funds required.



- 14 -
1.31      In view of the considerable imbalances that exist in the structure
of tariffs and rates in the power sector, the Government and ISA's shareholders
are executing under San Carlos I (Loan 1582-CO) a country-wide tariff study
with a view toward assessing the cost of supply to each consumer category
(1.10). The study has suffered delays because of the time necessary for the
Colombians, who are carrying out the study, to become familiar with the
principles of marginal costing. On the basis of preliminary findings, a
successful seminar on electricity pricing in Latin America (75 participants
representing 21 countries and 3 international institutions) was held in
Medellin in October/November 1979, under the aegis of the Bank. The basic
study is now expected to be completed by about September 1980.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.32      In the past, the large number of entities associated with the
power sector, the lack of adequate regulation, coordination and planning at
the national level and low electricity rates constrained the sector's ability
to make rational use of Colombia's abundant hydroelectric resources. The
regionalized nature of the sector, reflecting the political and economic
decentralization of Colombia, engendered difficulties in coordinating invest-
ment allocation; decisions were made on a local basis without due regard to
overall country planning for power development. This situation together with
the lack of funds, resulted in recurring power shortages. The most recent
developments (1.11) highlight the difficulties of effecting basic changes in a
strong historical pattern in response to the requirements of an increasingly
sophisticated and rapidly developing economic situation.
1.33      The successful long-term execution of Colombia's power development
is contingent upon the availability of sufficient cash generation by the
individual entities, and domestic and external sources of financing. Detailed
discussions on this subject are the focus of considerable Government attention
at this time. The dimensions of this are further enlarged by the sector's
organization, which has precluded the usual practice of channeling resources
within the sector from well-developed urban markets to support service in the
poorer regions of the country, particularly rural areas (1.29), except indi-
rectly by investments of the shareholders in ISA's generating and transmission
plant which may provide supply to these areas.
1.34      ICEL's financial requirements have grown at a much more rapid pace
than its capabilities. The problem derives mainly from overdue accounts for
electricity purchased from ISA by ICEL's subsidiaries some of which do not
have the capacity to pay due to high operating cost and/or insufficient rates.
A smaller portion of arrears is related to investment contributions to ISA,
which are covered by national budgetary allocation   The arrears are a matter
of serious concern to the Government, ISA and the other shareholders. To date
ISA's construction program appears not to have been affected but if arrears
would continue to accumulate, ISA's program may be slowed, which would affect
all the shareholder's ability to meet electricity requirements. In addition
to the immediate corrective action under consideration by the Colombian
authorities (1.12), a long-term solution is being sought by the Government
and the Bank, which would form part of the arrangements to be made under
the proposed Guavio hydro power project, taking also into account ICEL's
proposal to finance in part the Betania hydro plant.



- 15 -
1.35      The Government has recently taken a number of positive measures
to address the sector's institutional constraints. In 1975, it eliminated
the jurisdictional overlap between ICEL and CORELCA on the Atlantic Coast by
transferring control over the electricity distribution companies in that
region to CORELCA. Another positive measure was the reorientation of ICEL,
which basically is responsible for electricity development in rural and
semi-rural areas, where the Government will continue to subsidize the service
since ICEL cannot be financially self-supporting in those areas.
1.36      With the addition of CORELCA as an ISA shareholder, most of the
sector is represented directly or indirectly in ISA's Board and coordination
of power sector planning in Colombia has improved. ISA's effectiveness in
maintaining this coordination, however, will depend on its ability to sustain
a sound consensus among its shareholders.

2. THE BORROWER
General
2.01       In 1955 the Government of Colombia authorized the municipality of
Medellin to organize Medellin's municipal services as administratively autono-
mous units, with the objective of providing energy, telephone, water and
sewerage services to Medellin, and to other municipalities which requested
such provision from Medellin. In its Order No. 58 of 1955, the Medellin
municipality established Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM)--the autonomous
company created in accordance with Decreto 1816 of 1955. All assets related
to these public services were transferred from the municipality to EPM. The
three branches of EPM are operated as financially independent departments with
separate accounts. EPM operates power facilities in Antioquia, and gives
electricity service to Medellin and to numerous other adjacent urban and rural
areas under the jurisdiction of their respective municipalities and to the
Electrificadora de Antioquia, an ICEL subsidiary, in the remaining territory
of the province (3.01).
Previous Bank Lending
2.02      The Bank has made 4 loans, totalling MUS$135, to EPM for generation
(which assisted in financing about three-quarters of EPM's present installed
capacity of 779 MW); 250-CO in 1959, 282-CO in 1961, 369-CO in 1964 and 874-CO
in 1973. The fourth loan is helping to finance the almost completed expansion
of the Guatape hydro facilities, which raised the dam of the Santa Rita
reservoir-not only to increase EPM's generation but also to allow optimum
design of the downstream San Carlos hydro plant - and added 4 units to the
Guatape I power station (financed by loan 369-CO). The Guatape II project has
been delayed by about 2 years due to resettlement problems of the village of
El Penol, geological difficulties in tunnelling, welding problems in the
penstock lining and design problems in the turbine and generators. All of
these problems have been resolved and the plant is now being commissioned.
In early 1980, the Bank also extended a loan (MUS$44) to EPM for part of its
telecommunication program.
Organization
2.03      EPM is administered by a 7-member Board of Directors appointed at
the same time for a renewable term of 2 years, with the Mayor of Medellin as
Chairman. A ruling was passed on October 31, 1979, by the Consejo del
Estado, that the Mayor of Medellin (rather than the Mayor and the Municipal
Council) has the authority to appoint and dismiss, without limitation as to
his prerogatives of doing so, all board members of municipal entities, in-
cluding EPM. The ruling became effective in March 1980, and the Mayor is
expected to proceed to select new Board members before the term of the present
members expires by the end of this year. Prior to this change the municipality
dominated EPM's Board and voting in this Board on decisions already taken in
the Municipal Council was a mere formality. This has led to some actions
which appear not to have been in the best interests of EPM; appropriate tariff
actions (2.12, 5.18) and improved investment limitations (5.23),



- 17 -
are expected to avoid such actions in the future. The existing
agreement (874-CO) specifying that a change in EPM's statutes or that new
legislation be adopted by the Municipal Council, adversely affecting the
management and operations of EPM, would be an event of default, would be
repeated for the proposed loan.
2.04      The General Manager who is appointed by the Board and has a term
renewable each year, is responsible for EPM's day-to-day management. He
oversees directly the. work of (a) four managers, responsible for technical
matters, operations, finance and adminstration; (b) the secretary general in
charge of legal affairs and archives; and (c) a planning director in charge of
planning and coordination. Below the level of the managers, the organization
is to the extent possible separated administratively into EMP's 3 branches of
utility services: Water and Sewerage, Telephone, and Power. Each branch
works fairly independently of the others, and separate financial statements
are prepared. EPM's Board of Directors, however, receives a consolidated
financial statement for all of EPM's services. EPM's organizational chart
is shown in Annex 2.1.
2.05      The organizational arrangements for the power branch are generally
satisfactory, except that the financial responsibilities of the Planning
Construction and Supervision Divisions appear to be too limited. This is in
part due to the computerization in the Financial Department of cost-accounting
and financial forecasts, which tend to shift the financial' responsibility from
the engineer to the accountant. EPM is aware of the problem and is studying
methods to redefine responsibilities more efficiently.
Personnel
2.06      EPM, as of December 1979, had 3,618 employees of which about 1,700
pertain to its power branch. Personnel working directly for power numbered
846 (56 in planning and design, 33 in power station construction, 489 in
power stations and substation operation, 268 in distribution). In addition,
about an equal number of staff can be assumed to work principally for power in
finance, administration and general services. By the end of 1979 EPMf had an
installed capacity of 979 MW (including Guatape II nearing completion) genera-
ting some 4,130 GWh for about 270,000 consumers of electricity.  The power
station personnel ratio, therefore, is about 2 MW/employee, the overall staff
production ratio 2.9 GWh/employee, or 6 employees. for 1,000 connections, which
is considered reasonable. Turnover also appears reasonable; in the first
11 months of 1979, 348 people terminated employment, including 27 who retired
on pension; on this basis average employment is about 10 years per person.
The pay scales appear generally attractive ranging from Col$7,000-8,000/m for
the lowest graded workers (US$166-190/m) to Col$16,000-37,000/m (US$380-880/m)
for professionals, to which almost 3 months in pay is added in fringe benefits.
This does not take into account EMP's contributions toward the retirement plan.
Through the 1980s, increase in personnel directly employed in power is estimated
at some 300, of which about 130 would be required for plant operation (Guadalupe
IV, Playas) and the remaining for transmission and distribution and general
power services. The overall manpower efficiency for EPM power service
(although expected to remain about equal to the present figures) is difficult
to forecast because of common use of financial and administrative personnel by
all of EPM's service branches.



- 18 -
2.07      EPM's engineering and planning staff is well qualified, is competent
and has considerable experience in project management and operation. This
would enable it to manage and operate efficiently the considerable expansion
of facilities during 1980-86, including the project. EPM's finance and
management staff is also generally well qualified and capable.
Training
2.08      EPM is constructing a new training center to continue giving
courses to administrative and operational personnel of all its branches.
Building construction is well advanced and the center is expected to be in
operation by end-1980. Regular courses would be given to train new staff and
existing staff would receive refresher courses. At present, EPM trains
existing and new plant maintenance staff. The 1979 training program resulted
in about 950 participants, each obtaining about 60 hours of instruction. The
training arrangements are satisfactory. However, EPM's professional staff
requires some post-graduate work in highly specialized areas. A training
component for this purpose has been included in the loan (4.14).
Accounting and Auditing
2.09      EPM's has an accrual accounting system which is appropriate, and
tabulations and reporting are carried out effectively with the aid of a small
computer. Monthly financial statements and budget reports are available
promptly and, apart from minor inconsistencies expected to be eliminated
resulting from the st-dy on a uniform system of accounts for the sector
(1.10), contain the iiformation necessary for management review. EPM's
internal audit is alsc adequate. The auditor is appointed by the Municipal
Council of Medellin and reports directly to EPM's Board and the Municipality.
The annual internal audit report is issued within three months after the end
of the fiscal year. In accordance with agreements reached under loan 874-CO
(Guatape II), EPM engaged independent external auditors to audit the accounts
of all its operations, and their reports have been acceptable. The existing
covenant related to accounting and auditing, including the requirement to
submit the audited accounts and the auditors report to the Bank not later than
4 months after end of each fiscal year, would be repeated under the proposed
loan but for the time limit which would be extended to 5 months to bring it
into line with historic performance.
Billing and Collections
2.10      EPM's billing and collection procedures are satisfactory.  Billing
is computerized and subscribers are billed monthly. Bills become due about
ten days after being received by the subscriber. While a consolidated bill
for water and sewerage, electricity and telephone services is prepared, the
charge for each service is shown separately. If the subscriber does not
settle the account within three months, all utility services to the subscriber
are disconnected. As a result of this rigid disconnection policy the level of
outstanding and overdue accounts is generally low (5.05).



- 19 -
Insurance
2.11      EPM's power assets were not adequately insured, but it has recently
made arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for such insurance. EPM has also
expressed its intention to seek expert advice on the insurance of large civil
works under construction in relation to the Guadalupe IV project. The existing
insurance covenant would be repeated for the proposed loan.
Tariff and Rates
2.12      EPM historic costs, particularly capital costs, have been low and
as a result, its average rate is one of the lowest in the country, if not in
the world: 65.3 centavos/kWh (USq1.65 kWh) at the end of 1978 (estimated to
average USJ1.95 in 1979). Under the San Carlos loans, EPHI had obtained the
necessary authorization from JNT, and had instituted a 2.2% monthly rate
increase in order to reach the agreed rates of return of 7% in 1978, 6% in
1979 and 9% in 1980 and subsequent years. However, in January 1979 EPM's
Board decreased the monthly rate increase to 1.5% for residential consumers
and to 1.8% for all other consumers, with the intention to raise them again to
the level of 2.2%/m after the municipal elections (March 1980). EPM's Board
has recently reinstated the 2.2% monthly increase, effective April 1, 1980.
Further tariff action is required for EPM to maintain a satisfactory financial
position (5.18, 5.19).
2.13      EPM's tariff structure is seriously imbalanced, with residential and
block rates (to other municipalities and the ICEL subsidiary - see paragraph
3.01) significantly lower than industrial and commercial ones, and over
recent years this gap has been widening. This can be illustrated by comparing
average 1973 and 1978 rates, expressed in USc per kWh, after inflating 1973
average rates by the cost of living index (using 1973 as a base) and using the
average 1978 rate of exchange:

While the cost of supply in low voltage networks, (i.e. largely for supply to
households) in general exceeds the cost of supply in the high voltage networks
(i.e. to most industrial consumers), industry paid about 15% more than residen-
tial consumers in 1973,but 84% more in 1978. Residential rates, in real
terms, decreased by 10%, while industrial rates increased by 44%. This
increasing imbalance is unsatisfactory, even taking into account that in real
terms the overall average rate increased 13% over the period.
2.14      The ongoing tariff study under San Carlos I (1.10) is expected to
identify for the main supply centers in Colombia, the marginal cost of supply
to the various consumer groups at the various points of supply and in time of
the season, week and day. This study is expected to assist the sector and the
Government in coming to grips with the problem of unbalanced tariff structures
and seeking corrective actions through gradual adjustments. However, the
study has suffered delays and is not expected to be completed before September
1980. Awaiting the outcome of the study, EEEB agreed (Loan 1807-CO) to
prepare and institute an interim program which would gradually adjust rates
during a two year period by apportioning future rate increases among the major
categories of consumers in such a way as to gradually reduce the imbalance.
Likewise, EPM has agreed to prepare by March 31, 1981, a program satisfactory
to the Bank of gradual revisions of its tariff structure and rates for its
power services, taking into account the conclusions of the ongoing tariff
study and put into effect such program by May 31, 1981. In the event, however
that EPM would be unable to prepare such program because of further delays in
completing the tariff study, it has agreed to prepare by March 31, 1980, an
interim program satisfactory to the Bank, covering the period from May 31,
1981 through May 31, 1983, for the same purpose as the above program and
institute such interim program by May 31, 1981. When the tariff study becomes
available, EPM would prepare a program as referred to above; this program
would replace the interim program. The program would also take into account
the income redistribution policies of the government benefitting the lowest-
income consumers.

3. EPM'S MARKET
Supply Area, Access to Electricity
3.01      EPM's statutory service area is the municipality of Medellin.  However,
service can be given under separate contracts to any area in the Department of
Antioquia. Accordingly, EPM supplies directly 15 small municipalities (i.e.,
it owns the networks in the villages and bills for the service), sells in
block to 10 other municipalities having their own distribution services, and
sells indirectly (through supply to the Electrificadora de Antioquia, an ICEL
subsidiary) to 67 municipalities. Thus, of the 116 municipalities in the
province, 92--or about 80%--are directly or indirectly supplied with electri-
city by EPM. The total population of Antioqua is estimated at 3.4 million, of
which an estimated 2.2 million--or 65%--have access to electricity. EPM
supplies directly to about 270,000 consumers of which about 90% is residential.
The Electrificadora de Antioquia has about 100,000 consumers. Antioquia
accounted for about 22% of national gross electric energy requirements in
1977/78.
Historic Development
3.02      The 1975-78 consumption and supply data are shown in Annex 3.1,
including the energy EPM purchased from and supplied to ISA. EPM's consumer
data for 1968, 1973, 1978 is the following:
Annual

Supply to (from) ISA            -            -          (454)
EPM generation               1,698       2,588         3,185
Maximum demand (MW)            327         505           700          7.9
Number of consumers       140,766      207,450       261,273          6.4
The major change in the consumers' share of the market over the 10-year period
was in the block sales to municipalities and the electrificadora, which
increased an average of 21.5%/a and accounted for 14% of sales in 1978.
Excluding this supply from the comparison indicates that the consumption
pattern for the other classes of consumers decreased fractionally for resi-
dential consumers and commensurately increased for commerce and industry,



- 22 -
i.e, the overall pattern remained about the same. The residential consumers
showed the lowest growth rate, which is surprising (saturation is not apparent,
since 1970 consumption per residential connection increased about 1.6%/a to
475 kWh/m and the number of consumers rose by 6.1%/a) in view of the fact that
the rates for these consumers are very low, USi1.26/kWh in 1978 at the then
current rate of exchange. The rapid increase in block supply may in part be
due to the extremely low rate charged by EPM for this service, in 1978 amount-
ing to USiO.71/kWh equivalent. Overall growth in sales during the period was
9.6%/a, but it should be noted that average growth was considerably lower
during the last 5 years (7.3%/a) than the previous 5 years (11.5%/a). Growth
of total energy requirements and maximum demand was substantially lower due to
the decrease in losses from 28% in 1968 to 17% in 1978. Losses, however, are
still relatively high for EPM's 100% hydro system (losses, unaccounted for,
including thefts, are probably in the order of 7%). This problem is presenty
being studied throughout the sector (1.10) and remedial action is expected to
be instituted as a result of the study. Gross per capita consumption in EPM's
supply area in 1978 was in the order of 1,000 kWh, probably the highest area
consumption in the country (in Bogota, annual per capita consumption is in the
order of 850 kWh).
3.03      Captive Plant.  The total installed self generating capacity in fac-
tories in Antioquia is about 70 MW or 10% of EPM's installed capacity. About
35 MW pertains to two large textile factories, 18 MW to two cement plants, 13
MW to a mining company and the remaining to various small factories. Only one
of the cement plants and the mining company are not connected to EPM's supply
facilities. Supply figures (i.e., GWh for self-use) are not available.
3.04      Forecasts.  EPM's sales are expected to grow at an average of 9%/a
over 1978-86 and gross energy requirements in its system by 8.5%/a (Annex 3.1).
This forecast was prepared essentially on the basis of historic trends.
EPM uses simple exponential models for both energy consumption (for the
various consumer categories and totals) and demand, deriving trend curves for
forecasting requirements through 1986. Because the historic results compared
with forecasts made with these simple models were generally in good agreement,
EPM did not study alternative models. (However, ISA is presently studying the
applicability of socio-economic multi-regression models throughout the sector.)
The present forecasts are considered adequate.  The following table summarizes
the results:

3.05       Residential consumers are expected to continue decreasing slightly
their share in the market at about the modest growth rate of the last 5 years
(3.02). Commerce and industry would commensurately increase their share of
the market at a growth rate of about 10-11%. Because, for as yet unidentified
reasons, the rapid increase in block supplies decreased to practically zero in
1979, and no consumer information is available, EPM decided to conservatively
assume a 9% annual growth. This appears appropriate in the light of the
necessity to adjust the block charges together with all other rates in the
near future (2.13). It appears possible (discussions are underway) that EPM
will take over several networks from independent municipalities and bill
consumers directly because these municipalities are unable to maintain or
improve the networks and to pay EPM for the supply. The number of consumers
is expected to increase by about 4%/a to about 360,000 by 1986. Total energy
requirements would grow less than sales in view of the expected lower losses
due to the actions to be taken against thefts (3.02). The load factor is
expected to remain about 59% during the period.
3.06      The generation forecast has been based on the average water avail-
ability in the rivers on which EPM's plants are located. Additionally, by
investing in ISA plant (Chivor, San Carlos, Jaguas) EPM has obtained rights to
a portion of the generation capabilities and capacities of these plants. The
energy rights are shown in the above table together with the average surplus
that could be generated by EPM plant. The total surplus would be available in
the interconnected system for sales to other shareholders. For purposes of
revenue forecasts, EPM, on the basis of a simulation study prepared by ISA,
has made assumptions for the portion of the energy and commensurate capacity
surplus that, on average, is expected to be sold in the interconnected system



- 24 -
as firm and secondary energy during the period to other shareholders which
cannot meet their own requirements and depend on ISA and its other shareholders
having surpluses (presently only EPM). The total (available 95% of the time)
amounts to about 65% of this surplus, which appears conservative.

4. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
4.01      EPM has prepared a power development program for 1980-88, of which
the 1980-86 portion is discussed here, to meet gross energy requirements
expected to grow at 8.5% from 3,639 GWh in 1978 to 7,000 GWh in 1986 (3.04).
The number of consumers would increase from about 270,000 in 1979 to about
360,000 in 1986, at an annual growth rate of 4% (3.05). These growth rates
are similar to those experienced in the previous decade. The expansion
pertains mainly to the urban area of Medellin and the Aburra valley in which
this city is located. Modest expansion is planned in the remaining area of
the province of Antioquia (largely the supply area of the Electrificadora de
Antioquia, an ICEL subsidiary), mainly in transmission lines and substations.
EPM also assists the Electrificadora by constructing some distribution net-
works which, upon completion, are transferred to the Electrificadora as an
equity contribution, for which it obtains shares in the company.
4.02      EPM's 1980-86 development program (Annex 4.1) excluding contribu-
tions to ISA and excluding interest during construction, is estimated to cost
MUS$665 at current prices, with a foreign component of MUS$385 (58%).  Its
main components are:
(a) ongoing works in generation, i.e., the almost completed
Guatape II hydro plant (Loan 874-CO), a small hydro plant
(19 MW) at Ayura, the diversion of 3 small rivers to the
Troneras reservoir (the reservoir supplying the Troneras
and Guadalupe I-III plants); the Guadalupe IV hydro plant
to be financed by the proposed loan and the Playas hydro
plant for which construction has not yet started;
(b) some ongoing works in transmission and substations and a
substantial expansion program to be financed by EPM, from
a recently obtained loan of MUS$32 from the Bank of America
and by the proposed loan; the latter would also finance
special metering equipment; construction and maintenance
vehicles; and
(c) studies of potential hydro developments in Antioquia, partially
financed by FONADE (Loan 971-CO), a transmission network study,
and training to be financed by the proposed loan.
The Project
4.03      Objectives - The objectives of the project are to assist EPM to meet
incremental power requirements in the rapidly expanding urban area of Medellin,
expand the supply system to the rural areas (which, inter alia, would allow
replacing some costly and unreliable supply from individual diesel plants),
and improve reliability of supply in existing networks. The project would
also assure completion of EPM's regional control center as part of the dis-
patch system in the integrated network. Additionally the objective would
be to raise EPM's rates as necessary to ensure sufficient internal cash
generation for investment and introduce an adjustment in the rate structure
to remove gradually the existing imbalances.



- 26 -
4.04      Description - The project comprises:
(a)  The Guadalupe IV hydro plant.  The plant, the construction costs
of which is estimated at about MUS$150 (US$700/kW) at current
prices, will be located immediately downstream from the existing
Troneras (36 MW) hydro plant and the Guadalupe I (25 MW) and
Guadalupe III (270 MW) power stations which are hydrologically in
parallel, replacing the obsolete Guadalupe II plant. It would
operate under a gross head of 417 m, and generate an average of
1,077 GWh/a. It consists of:
- infrastructure, including 7.5 km of access roads;
-  a compensating concrete tanque of 22,000 m , immediately
draining into a vertical well, 57 m deep;
- the first part, 2.6 km long, of a horizontal (1% incline)
concrete lined power tunnel with a diameter of 4.5 m, which
leads to a second well, 131 m deep in order to assure ade-
quate overburden under a canyon crossing the tunnel;
- the second part of the power tunnel, about 3.9 km long
with an incline of 0.5%;
- a surge tank of the restrictive orifice type near the end of
the second part of the power tunnel;
- two surface penstocks about 540 m long with a diameter of
2.80/2.60 m; the last part will cross the Guadalupe river and
for this purpose be sunk in a trench in the riverbed (for this
and the construction of the powerhouse, the river will be
diverted through a 350 m long diversion channel);
- a surface power station suitable to install 4 turbine generator
units of which 3 will be installed initially;
-  3 vertical Frances turbines, designed for 22 m /s at 74 MW and
514.3 rpm, each coupled to 71-MW generator at 13.8 kV and a
power factor of 0.9;
- a substation adjacent to the power station with 2 banks of
3 single phase transformers of 59 MVA each (one bank for
2 turbine-generator units) for stepping up the voltage to
230 kV;
(b)  EPM's 1982-1984 transmission line development program (which
constitutes about 65-70%--expressed in base cost--of EPM's 1980-86
transmission line program) comprising 10 km of single circuit 44-kV
lines, 30 km of single circuit and 15 km double circuit 110-kV lines
and 93 km of double circuit 230-kV lines;



- 27 -
(c)  expansion of 5 or 6 existing and construction of 4 or 5 new
substations (constituting about 35%--expressed in base cost--of
EPM's 1980-86 substation program, about 60% of which would be
financed by a Bank of America loan), together comprising about 420
MVA in transformer capacity;
(d)  construction of EPM's control center;
(e)  the 1982-84 portion of EPM's 1980-86 renovation and expansion
program in distribution overhead and underground networks
(constituting about 55%--expressed in base cost--of EPM's 1980-86
program), comprising about 129 km of 13.2-kV overhead lines, 41
km of 13.2-kV underground cables, 22 km of 44-kV overhead lines,
111 km LT lines, 11 MVA in distribution transformers and special
metering equipment such as a cable fault locator, current sensors
(2,900) and power registering meter systems (16), cable laying
vehicles (2), pole erecting vehicles (2), three cutting vehicles
(1), maintenance vehicles (2), line and cable tools, mobile
phones (30) and manhole ventilators (2); and
(f)  a specialized training program for EPM's professional staff
consisting of about 8 scholarships each year during 1981-84
plus special training for the staff of the power planning
department.
4.05      Cost - The total cost of the project is estimated at MCol$13,374
(MUS$228.3) including a foreign component of MCol$9,161 (MUS$155.2),
equivalent to 68% of total project cost.   Project costs, which are shown

4.06      The project cost is based on estimated December 1978 prices which,
for Guadalupe IV, are based on recent contracts and offers for hydro stations
(San Carlos, Janguas) being constructed in Colombia and, for transmission
and distribution based on EPM's experience with equipment procurement. The
project costs are considered reasonable. EPM is exempt from custom duties
on imported goods, and any taxes on procured goods. The physical contin-
gencies correspond to the risks intrinsic to the various project components.
For Guadalupe IV civil works they vary from 15% (surface work) to 20% (under-
ground work) and for equipment between 10% (generators, turbines) and 15%
(small equipment, penstock); for the other components of the project they vary
from 10% (foreign equipment) to 15% (local equipment and labor). These
percentages are considered appropriate in view of the status of design. A
price contingency has been added as follows: local cost inflation was assumed
to decrease from 26% in 1979 to 15% in 1982 and subsequent years; foreign cost
12% in 1979, 10.5% in 1980, 9% in 1981 and one percentage point lower each
year for each subsequent year until 1986.
4.07      Financing - A Bank loan of MUS$125 is proposed for the Guadalupe IV
project, representing about 80% of the foreign exchange component of MUS$155.2
(19% of the total cost of EPM's 1980-1986 development program), as follows:
MUS$
Guadalupe IV                                         71.2
Transmission lines                                   11.2
Substations                                         15.6
Control Center                                      10.3
Distribution                                         13.7
Special utility equipment                             1.6
Transmission study                                    0.2
Training                                              1.2
125.0
Suppliers credits and external commercial borrowings would finance up to
MUS$30.2 of the foreign cost for the Guadalupe IV turbines and generators and
the remaining foreign costs, mainly for distribution and transmission, not
financed by manufacturers (which were assumed to financed 85% of the cost of
equipment to be supplied by them). EPM would finance the local cost (MUS$73.1)
from its own resources, mainly internally generated funds.
Engineering, Studies, Training
4.08      Guadalupe IV - The feasability study for the hydro plant (June
1979) particularly with respect to plant design, was found to be generally
acceptable, except that the tunnel level (second part) was not optimized
and the cost estimate could be improved. A rush drilling program was
instituted in September 1979 in order to assess the depth of the so called
Antioquian batholite, which would allow to locate the second part of the
power tunnel in substantially solid rock, thus decreasing requirements for
concrete lining of the tunnel. In view of the local geological conditions it



- 29 -
however, become obvious that the project would suffer a delay of at least
half a year if preparation of bid documents would await the results of the
drilling. Because of the obvious benefits to the interconnected system of
completing the Guadalupe plant as soon as possible (delays in plant comple-
tion and in initiating construction of new plants have caused two zostly
emergency programs and it appears that even these will not remove the consid-
erable risks of curtailments throughout the eighties), it was agreed with EPM
(a) to locate the tunnel of the optimum depth - i.e. 50m lower than designed -
assuming a completely lined tunnel, (b) to continue the drilling in order to
assess whether adjustments will have to be made and (c) to prepare bid docu-
ments allowing adjustments to such changes. Because it appears probable that
a large section of the tunnel will be in solid rock (decreasing lining cost)
the cost estimate is deemed to be sufficiently conservative to allow for some
design changes during execution.
4.09      EPM will continue to employ its consultants for the Guadalupe
plant, Consultores Tecnicos Ltda y Mejia y Millan Ltda. (Colombia), for
final design and supervision. Its contract with EPM is being financed by a
FONADE loan of MCol$30. This contract, which terminates in March 1982, is
also acceptable to the Bank and the proposed loan would finance the remaining
part of the contract once the FONADE funds have been exhausted, which is ex-
pected in early 1982. EPM would sign not later than April 30, 1982 a new
contract acceptable to the Bank with the same consultants for the continua-
tion of their services until completion of Guadalupe IV.  The proposed loan
would finance this contract. The loan would finance 100% of the foreign cost
of foreign consultants and 50% of the local cost of local consultants.
The estimated base cost of the services to be financed in part by the loan is
MUS$5 in which general cost (surveys, drilling, test, etc.) is estimated at
-MUS$1. The consultants are paid on the basis of the cost of all personnel
assigned from time to time to the project, including salary costs, social
benefits and profit margin. Their present average salaries are about
US$1,100/month. It is estimated that some 3,200 m.m. of such services will
be required.
4.10      Transmission, Distribution - Under the Guatape II loan (874-CO) EPM,
with the assistance of Westinghouse executed a study for the expansion of its
sub-transmission and distribution system, particularly with respect to optimum
size and location of substations, capacity and length of lines, and standardi-
zation of line components and transformers. The results were used by EPM for
the design of the network included in its 1980-86 program. The network design
is technically simple and follows American standards, except in the underground
portion of the network in the center of Medellin where a 3-phase 4-wire
208/110-V system was installed many years ago, and which would be extremely
costly to change. Present practices are adequate and will be continued, with
emphasis on standardization throughout the network. As in the past, the work
will largely be executed by local contractors under supervision of EPM, assisted
by consultants, which is satisfactory. It should be noted that EPM itself would
construct only about one fifth (some 260 km) of the total required low voltage
distribution networks; four-fifths would - as in the past - be constructed by



- 30 -
developers in accordance with EPM's standards. On completion, these networks
are transferred to EPM at no cost for incorporation in EPM's assets. Conse-
quently, the cost of such networks (some MUS$8) have not been shown in EPM's
investment programs.
4.11      The development of Medellin's network has been from within, i.e.,
110-kV lines have been extended following the development of the city in
the rather narrow valley. Line and substation congestions are rapidly
developing and, although the outline of a 230-kV ring around the city is
becoming apparent, no comprehensive study has been made with respect to the
future high voltage supply system. During appraisal this was discussed
with EPM, and the carrying out of a study of EPM's high voltage transmission
system was agreed upon. Consultants would be engaged by December 31, 1981
under acceptable terms and conditions. The cost of this study, which should
be completed by September 30, 1982, is estimated at MUS$0.4 of which about
half would be financed by the proposed loan.
4.12      Control Center - The basis for the dispatch system in the intercon-
nected network was planned by ISA in coordination with its shareholders and
with the assistance of consultants (Systems Control of USA in cooperation with
Sistecom of Colombia). It envisions the construction of a national dispatch
center in Medellin (ISA) and, initially, 3 regional control centers. ISA's
dispatch center is in execution, CORELCA has signed the contract for supply
and erection and both EEEB and EPM are coordinating the preparation of terms
of reference for engineering consultant services for final design, preparation
of bid documents and supervision of execution of their respective control
centers. The basic concepts for all regional centers are equal, they differ
only to the extent required in view of operational requirements and physical
differences of plant. In order to realize the full benefits of operating the
interconnected system at least cost as soon as possible, EPM has decided to
complete its control center, which would be financed by the proposed loan,
without delay. It is estimated that already both EEEB's and the EPM's center
will lag behind the completion of the ISA and CORELCA centers, by almost 2
years.
4.13      EPM has obtained a loan from FONADE for the relevant consulting
services and it would engage the services of consultants for the execution
of its control center not later than September 30, 1980 under acceptable terms
of reference (already agreed with the Bank). The services would be in 2
phases:  (a) final design, preparation and issue of bid documents (April 30,
1981) and award (October 30, 1981), and (b) supervision of execution.
4.14      Training - As is common in the Colombian power sector, EPM's practice
is to use local engineering firms to assists its staff as needed for detailed
design, procurement, and supervision of construction. Although this has
worked reasonably well in the past, ISA and its shareholders have been studying
the obvious drawbacks of this system in relation to rapidly growing construc-
tion responsibilities: how to adequately supervise in the future performance
of consultants while to reducing reliance on outside services where possible.
Funds have been included in the most recent loan to ISA (San Carlos II, loan
1725-CO) for specialized graduate training in specific areas required by the
sector, such as hydrology, soil and rock mechanics, geomorphology, seismology,
energy planning and dispatch, protection and specialized equipment and civil



- 31 -
works. The proposed loan would complement this effort by financing 8 scholar-
ships per year during 1989-84 at a cost of about US$1,200/m each. In addition,
the proposed loan would finance the foreign cost of specialized training of
the staff in the power planning, which would consist of 3-4 group missions of
these professio->als to other public utilities of Latin America and elsewhere
to update their expertise. The foreign cost of these missions is estimated at
about US$100,000/a each for the same period. The graduate training program
would be carried out in coordination with ISA as the latter will execute its
study of manpower requirements to identify the areas of required training for
its own staff (similar to EPM's) and the programs and resources through which
the training can be obtained.
Execution
4.15       Implementation Schedule - The implementation schedule, of which the
key dates are shown in Attachment 4.3, would be used to monitor project progress
during the construction period. The main project component, the Guadalupe IV
station is expected to be completed by mid-1984, and transmission and distri-
bution components by the end of that year.
4.16       Procurement - Procurement of goods and services to be financed by the
proposed loan (other than consulting services and training) would be through
international competitive bidding under Bank guidelines for procurement.
Colombian manufacturers would receive a preference of 15%, or applicable
duties, whichever is lower, for purposes of bid evaluation. The cost estimates
assume that local manufacturers would supply conductors, constructional steel,
towers and miscellaneous distribution equipment, with an estimated cost of
some MUS$10, the ex-factory cost (net of taxes) of which would be financed by
the loan.
4.17       Disbursements - Funds from the proposed loan would finance the
foreign cost of (a) 52% of total expenditures for the civil works for the
Guadalupe IV hydro plant, (b) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly
imported equipment and 94% of the ex-factory cost of locally produced materials
and equipment, (c) 100% of foreign expenditures for foreign consultants and
50% of local expenditures for local consultants, and (d) 100% of foreign
expenditures for training. All disbursements requests would be fully docu-
mented. Annex 4.4 shows the estimated loan disbursements. The closing date
would be June 30, 1985.
Retroactive Financing
4.18       In order to avoid delays in its construction program, EPM may have
to award some small contracts prior to loan signing. For this reason retro-
active financing is proposed, not exceeding MUS$ 0.5.
4.19       Environmental Aspects - Because the Guadalupe IV hydro plant would
use the existing water conveyance system, the environmental impact would be
limited to those inherent to the construction of new access roads and the new
power station including penstocks. The latter will be founded almost completely



- 32 -
on residual soil materials which will be more stabilized than it is now through
)adequate surface drainage and revegetation of bare portions of the terrain and
disturbed sections. Because the power station site is uninhabited and not used
for any agricultural purposes, there would be no displacement of people.
EPM has carried out previous transmission and distribution projects with due
regard to environmental factors. Under the project the 230-kV line will be of
a design consistent with minimal effects on land usage. Line routes, for
44 kV and 110 kV have been selected to follow existing rights of way, adjacent
to highways and roads, so that clearing of land will be kept to a minimum.
4.20      EPM has a study in execution of the sedimentation of its reser-
voirs, the results of which will be made available to the Bank upon completion
expected before the end of 1980. Loan 874-CO (Guatape II) provided for the
usual dam monitoring which, however, was restricted to the San Rita reservoir
and water works. The undertaking would be extended, under the proposed
project, to all of EPM's dams and waterworks pertaining to power.
4.21      Project Risk - The Guadalupe IV part of the project is subject to
the risks normally associated with civil works in difficult terrain and heavy
rain during the wet season, which may cause landslides in disturbed earth and
cause temporary work stoppage. However, since the surface work is limited to
the compensating tank, the penstock and the power stations (the latter is on a
flat piece of terrain, where no land slides can interfere with the works) the
physical risks are mainly due to stability problems to be solved for the
foliated and steep rocks adjacent to the compensating tank, and for tunneling.
Although it has been assumed that the tunnel would be largely constructed in
metamorphic rock, the possibility is high that, in effect, some sections will
be in the solid rock of the Antioquian batholite (4.08). No undue difficulties
are expected. The probable critical path of the project is the completion of
the dispatch center; the construction period of 3 years appears tight.
4.22      The procurement and construction schedule for the transmission
and distribution facilities is reasonable; no unusual delays are expected.
Timely completion of the main components of these facilities will depend
largely upon appropriate use of local consultants for assistance on detailed
design and procurement activities and upon the ability of local construction
firms to maintain schedules.

5. FINANCE
Summary
5.01      Except for 1974 and 1975, EPM has maintained a satisfactrry financial
position through its 21-year relationship with the Bank. The extra-fiscal
measures taken under recent agreements with the Bank, including revaluation of
assets for monitoring financial performance, have considerably strengthened
EPM's financial structure. The investments of EPM's Power Department for
the period 1980-1986 are forecast at MCol$60,405, of which MCol$16,228 (27%)
correspond to the proposed Guadalupe IV Hydro Power Project. Net internal
cash generation would finance MCol$35,940 (60% of total) and the remaining
MCol$24,551 (40%), would be covered by loans; the proposed loan amounts to
MCol$7,379 (MUS$125). The present financial projections are based on a plan
of tariff increases and on external and domestic inflation assumptions. The
net operating income with the above plan is expected to produce annual rates
of return on fully revalued assets ranging from 8% in 1980 to 16% in 1983 and
the company is expected to maintain an adequate financial position throughout
the projection period.
Consolidated Financial Performance
5.02      EPM's consolidated financial position as well as that of each of
its various departments (Power, Telephone, and Water and Sewerage) have been
satisfactory. During 1977-1979, the consolidated annual debt service coverage
ratio exceeded 2.0. The following table summarizes EMP's consolidated finan-
cial performance during this period (Annex 5.1).
Fiscal Year Ending December 31:          1977        1978       1979

Debt Service Coverage (times)               2.6       2.1         2.3
5.03      The projected flow of funds of each department (Telephone, Water
and Sewerage, Power) through 1984 has also been reviewed and, on this
basis, EPM's forecast future finances have been found satisfactory; annual
debt service coverage for each of these departments will not be less than 1.5
(Annexes 5.2 and 5.7). Each department is operated financially independently
of the other. EPM's current projections show that the future development
program of each department will not impose any financial constraints on the



- 34 -
other departments. However, the implications of an eventual deterioration
of the financial situation of any department on EPM's overall financial
situation as a whole or on the Power Department, have been examined and,
where necessary, appropriate covenants have been included in the proposed loan
agreement to ensure financial independence (5.19 through 5.24). EPM retains
all its profits because statutorily it is not required to pay dividends.
Instead, each department pays an annual contribution to the municipality of
Medellin based on the following percentages (fixed since 1955) of sales:
Power, 4.425%; Telephone, 3.420%; Water; 1.993%; and Sewerage, 2.473%.
Since EPM's accounts and budgets are maintained and audited separately for
each department, a detailed analysis has been made only for the Power Depart-
ment. Unless otherwise indicated, the following paragraphs relate only to the
Power Department.
Earnings History
5.04      Except for 1974 and 1975 EPM's Power Department has had a history of
satisfactory financial performance. Since 1976, its internal cash generation
has complemented adequately its financial requirements, fluctuating from 18%
in 1976 to 57% in 1979 of its investment needs, including substantial recent
contributions to ISA.  This may be attributed in large part to the high
density of its market and low-cost facilities, given the area's geographic
advantages for hydro generation. The balance of the company's investment
funds has been obtained through borrowings, generally at reasonable cost; no
subsidized government funding has been required.
5.05      Over 1973-1979, EPM's average rate increased in real terms by 13%.
Due to a program of fixed monthly increases instituted in 1978, rates are
expected to average USU2.28/kWh in 1980. The rate of return achieved in 1978
and estimated for 1979 of 7.6% and 7.8% are higher than covenanted rates of
return of 7% and 6%. At the end of 1979, EPM's estimated debt/equity ratio
was 36/64, calculated on the basis of revalued assets, and the debt service
coverage ratio (including investments in ISA) was 1.6. The company's cash and
working capital have been adequate in recent years; the current ratio has
exceeded 1.5 since 1976 and reached 3.3 in 1978. On average, accounts receiv-
able as a percentage of annual sales has not exceeded 19.2%.
Rate Base
5.06      For public accounting purposes, Colombia's public utility regulatory
law does not allow full revaluation of fixed assets but only adjustments to
match the revaluation of outstanding foreign debt. To reflect international
and domestic inflation, a fixed value of EPM's assets and accumulated depre-
ciation as of December 31, 1976 was estimated and agreed with the Bank (under
loan 1582-CO), to monitor the financial performance of the company. From this
date EPM revalues its assets quarterly by the Colombian cost of living index
to monitor its rate of return.



- 35 -
Tariff Structure
5.07      Although EPM's average rate is expected to continue to improve, its
tariff structure lacks appropriate balance among various major components.
The spread between average residential and average industrial/commercial
charges further widened because in 1979 the 2.2% across-the-board monthly
rate increases, in effect since 1978, was reduced to 1.5% for residential and
1.8 for all other consumer categories. Reinstatement of the 2.2% became
effective in April 1980, and a program of adjustments would be implemented
(2.14).
Financial Structure
5.08      The extra-fiscal measures taken since the San Carlos loans, including
revaluation of assets for monitoring financial performance, have strengthened
EPM's financial structure. As of December 31, 1979, the estimated capitaliza-
tion of EPM's Power Department was:
MCol$                        %
Capital                            43                          -
Donations                         513                          2
Accumulated Surplus             4,328                         18
Capital Revaluation            10,967                         44
Total Equity                   15,851                         64
Long-Term delt                  7,392                         30
Pension and Other
Liabilities Reserves            662                          3
Total Long-Term Liabilities   8,054                           33
Current Liabilities               790                          3
Total                          24,695                        100
5.09      The principal creditor of EPM's Power Department is the Bank; in
1979, debt under its first three loans from the Bank amounted to MCol$5,430
equivalent to 73% of total long-term debt. The second largest creditor is
Chase Manhattan Bank with 7%, followed by Brown Boveri and KfW with 4% and
3%. The remaining 13% is composed of debt from various local banks. Audited
figures for 1978 are given in Annex 5.3 The pension and other liability
reserves (noncurrent and contingent liabilities) are estimated at MCol$790
(3% of total capitalization).
Investment and Financing Plans
5.10      EPM's 1980-86 investment program, including construction, invest-
ments in ISA, interest during construction and requirements for working



- 36 -
capital, amounts to MCol$60,405, of which MCol$16,228 (27%) correspond to the
proposed project. The future Playas hydro power project, assumed to be
constructed and owned by EPM in this financial projection (1.11), is the
largest component of the investment program, requiring MCol$22,972 (39% of
total). The capital and bonds contributions to ISA, regarded as fixed finan-
cial obligations, are considered part of EPM's debt service and amount to
MCol$6,070 (10% of total). The proposed financing plan for EPM's investment
program is summarized on the next page.
5.11      EPM's net internal cash generation would finance MCol$35,940 (60%
of total) and the remaining MCol$24,551 (40%) would be covered by loans
(Annex 5.5). Of this figure, MCol$178 comes from undisbursed proceeds of
existing loans. The proposed loan for the Guadalupe IV Hydro Power Project
would amount to MCol$7,379 equivalent, the balance of MCol$2,554 is planned
to be covered by: (a) MCol$1,266 as part of the MCol$1,578 loan which EPM
contracted with Bank of America in February 1980 to finance part of its
investment program, (b) MCol$1,187 from suppliers credits and/or external
commercial banks, and (c) MCol$101 in local currency from FONADE. Borrowings
required for the Playas project, amounting to MCol$12,782, are assumed to be
covered by MCol$9,959 from IDB or other external sources and MCol$2,823 from
suppliers credits.
5.12      The remaining MCol$1,658 of required borrowings are planned to be
covered by MCol$362 from local banks, government and municipal loans for
financing local components of the construction program, MCol$486 from FONADE
to finance the cost of studies for future projects and MCol$810 of short
term loans through local commercial banks for financing part of the long-term
debt service in 1980 and 1981, in order to increase the availability of the
local currency requirements.
5.13      It is reasonable to expect that EPM will be able to obtain the
financing estimated above in view of its satisfactory financial position,
expected tariff increases, and the interest that domestic and external commer-
cial lenders are showing in EPM operations. Resulting from the agreements
reached under the Bank loan to EEEB for the Bogota Distribution project,
and from the San Carlos and 500-kV Interconnection loans, the Government
has confirmed that arrangements satisfactory to the Bank will be made to
provide the sector as a whole with the additional funds required for
the adequate and timely financing of the various projects under execution
which include Guadalupe IV. Effectiveness of the proposed loan would be
conditional upon receiving evidence that EPM has made satisfactory arrange-
ments for financing the balance of its requirements for the period 1980-1982.
5.14      The proposed Bank loan is assumed at an interest rate of 8.25% per
year plus a commitment charge of 3/4 of 1% with a repayment period of 17 years
including 4 years grace. The terms of other foreign and local borrowing
related to the proposed and future projects (Annex 5.3) are in line with the
general terms for EPM's current external and domestic borrowings. Disburse-
ment and debt service schedules of existing and future loans are given in
Annexes 5.8 through 5.10.

Liability Reserves
5.15      EPM maintains reserve accounts for its pension and severance
liabilities according to Colombian law, and pays directly from these accounts
to employees who leave the company. Annual provisions for these reserves are
determined from an actuarial study carried out in 1978. Other liability
reserves are EPM's self insurance fund, and a yearly reserve of MCol$100 to
cover most of the MCol$850 balloon payment of local loans maturing in 1983
(5.20); since estimated cash generation in 1983 is sufficient to cover said
balloon payments, this yearly reserve is assumed to be used to make up for
1980-1981 cash shortfalls.  The 1980-86 net increase in these reserves amounts
to 4% of total financing sources.
5.16      In addition to low-cost housing loans which EPM provides for its
employees, individual shares in the severance funds can be used by employees
for purchasing residential housing. As required by law, EPM pays interest
on the severance reserve in line with rates charged for similar arrange-
ments in other companies. Theise arrangements apply to all EPM's departments.
Future Finances
5.17      Forecast financial statements for 1980-86 are presented in Annex 5.4

1/   Gross internal cash generation divided by:  Debt service including interest
during construction not financed by loans and investments in ISA.
5.18      Projected revenues provide for the effects of expected local and
external inflation (4.06), exchange rate devaluation (increasing from Col$42.06
in 1979 to Col$81.17 per US$ in 1986) and are based on the following tariff
program:
(a) Reinstatement in April 1980 of the 2.2% monthly rate increase as
approved by the JNT and EPM's Board;



- 39 -
(b) Continuation of the 2.2% monthly rate increase, and one lump
increase to achieve rates of return of 9% in 1980, 1/ and 10.5% in
1981, based on the present forecast such lump increase would
amount to 10% in June 1981. These increases would reduce EPM's
local cash deficits during 1980 through 1982 down to MCol$810
(about iwS$16 - expected to be covered by short-term loans); without
these increases local cash deficits would accumulate to MCol$1,900
(about MUS$38). Although EPM's present debt/equity ratio, and
repayment potential would allow it to incur most of this debt, this
sum is considered excessive for the local capital market which is
already hard pressed to finance similar cash shortfalls of the other
power sector utilities;
(c) Continuation through 1983 of monthly rate increases of up to
2.2%; and
(d) Starting in January 1984, the monthly increase could be adjusted
downward to give minimum yearly rates of return of 10%.
5.19      EPM has agreed to increase its rates by 10% before June 1981, or
take equivalent actions to obtain the same funding in 1981, and continue
its monthly rate increase of up to 2.2% through 1983.
5.20      EPM's net operating income with the above plan is expected to
produce annual rates of return on fully revalued assets ranging from 8%
in 1980 to 16% in 1983 compared with no less than 9% covenanted under the
San Carlos loans. 1/ Tie increase comes from additional local cash require-
ments resulting from the assumption that EPM, instead of ISA, will construct
the Playas Hydro Power Plant, and from balloon payments due in 1982 and 1983
of local loans contracted by EPM during 1977-1978 to refinance the whole of
its foreign debt service payments due in those two years 2/. This yearly
rates of return covenant would be amended for the proposed loan in order
to achieve a minimum of 9% in 1980 3/, 10.5% in 1981, 13% in 1982 and 1983
and 10% in 1984 and thereafter, in line with the present internal cash genera-
tion requirements to maintain acceptable levels of debt service coverage,
debt/equity and current ratios. The method for calculating the rate of
return, and for periodic monitoring and implementing required adjustments of
covenanted rates and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.5, agreed under the
San Carlos II loan, would be repeated under the proposed loan.
1/   The 1980 rate of return of 8% actually increases to 9% when the 1979
surplus, as covenanted, is carried over to 1980.
2/   This financing operation was carried out to benefit from a low-cost local
credit facility provided by the Government to the sector to alleviate the
financial burdens of the majority of its utilities.
3/   Including the carry-over from 1979 mentioned in 1/.



- 40 -
Negative Pledge
5.21       The negative pledge, covenanted under loan 874-CO, whose applica-
bility was limited to the assets of EPM's Power Department, would be extended
to include EPM's other service departments. As a consequence (i) the covenant
under 874-CO regulating debtors to forego rights on EPM's assets would be
deleted; (ii) the debt service coverage test of at least 1.5 would be applied
to EMP's other departments; and (iii) EPM would, for each of its departments,
prepare and furnish to the Bank a yearly report no later than 3 months after
the end of EPM's fiscal year, on EPM's financial performance during that
year and projected through the following year.
Fund Utilization Limitation
5.22       The covenants under loan 874-CO limiting the transfer of funds from
the Power to the other departments of EPM and their independent operation
would be repeated under this proposed loan.
Investment Limitation
5.23       In addition to the limitation covenanted under San Carlos II on
investments in generating plants greater than 100 MW (1.28) a covenant would
be included in the proposed loan agreement to the effect that, except as the
Bank may otherwise agree, EPM would not incur expenditures for investments
not included in EPM's 1980-1986 investment program which exceed 1% of revalued
net fixed assets in operation 1/, or for investments unrelated to the operations
of its three departments.
EPM's Tariffs Requirements
5.24      The covenant under loan 874-CO whereby EPM shall establish and
maintain adequate tariff levels for each of its service departments and
provide reasonable rates of return and contributions toward new capital
investments of each department, would be repeated under the proposed loan.
1/   It would not be necessary to place an additional investment limitation on
operational investments to be used in common by two or more departments,
because (i) of the similar limitation (MUS$2 instead of 1% of revalued
net fixed assets in operation) covenanted under the recently Bank approved
Fifth Telecommunication Project loan to EPM; and (ii) any investments
made by EPM for the common use of its departments, has to be allocated to
each department in proportion to said use.

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost Solution
6.01       ISA annually defines the least cost development program ' r the
sector 1/, which then becomes the national development program for genera-
tion and 500-kV and 230-kV transmission.  The Guadalupe IV hydro plant is the
next plant in the program to be completed for the interconnected system
(followed by Betania, Playas and Guavio).
6.02      EPM's transmission, subtransmission and distribution program, including
the related part of the project, was designed on the basis of the 1980-86 load
forecast by the Westinghouse Study (4.10) which optimized substation and main.
conductor loading using the discounted cash flow method. Since the objective
is to provide electric service to some 12,000-14,000 new consumers each year
and to improve service coverage and quality through improving and expanding
the existing system, reasonable alternatives for the secondary network are
limited to EPM's standard design, which is simple and satisfactory.
Return on Investment
6.03      The return on investment was calculated as the discount rate equalizing
the present values of the streams of benefits and costs associated with EPM's
1979-1986 development program of which the Bank project is a part and cannot be
reasonably segregated. The cost streams comprise the capital costs of this
program and incremental operational and maintenance cost related to the incre-
mental sales associated with the program. These costs were converted to border
prices by means of weighted average conversion factors based on conversion
factors for individual local cost components (materials, machinery, equipment,
labor, consumables etc.). As a proxy for benefits, revenues were used,
derived from incremental sales associated with the program and average 1978
rates, adjusted to border prices by the standard conversion factor.
6.04      On this basis, the return on investment is about 7% (Attachment
6.1), compared with the opportunity cost of capital for Colombia, estimated to
be 11%. This low rate of return is of little significance as a measure of the
economic worth of EPM's program; it only reflects the end 1978 rate level
in relation to the cost of the 1980-86 development. However, on the basis
of the expected increase in rates of about 50%, calculated on the basis of the
present value of revenues derived from forecast sales and the real term annual
level of average rates, the return on investment is expected to be 13%
(6.05).
6.05      A sensitivity analysis was carried out to measure the impact of
major uncertainties underlying the return calculation. The analysis shows
the following:

The rate of return is not sensitive to a change in operational cost (including
purchases from ISA, which, until 1986, would be rather limited). The sensiti-
vity to capital cost changes is modest, i.e. about 1 percentage point per 10%
change in costs. The sensitivity of the rate of return to changes in benefits
(sales or rates) is about 1.23 percentage point per 10% change in benefits
from the base - i.e. the return on investment would be 13% for a real term
increase of 50%.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      Agreements have been reached that:
(a) Power tariff and rates would be restructured as follows:
(i) preparation of a program, by March 31, 1981, to
gradually adjust structure and rates, and putting such
program into effect by May 31, 1981 on the basis of
the result of the ongoing national tariff study; and
(ii) should the ongoing national tariff study be delayed,
EPM would submit satisfactory proposals for an interim
program for the same purpose as the above program, by
March 31, 1981, for implementation by May 31, 1981
through May 31, 1983; should the tariff study become
available, EPM would prepare a program as indicated
under (i) above; this program would replace the interim
program (2.14);
(b) EPM would sign, not later than April 30, 1982, a satisfactory
contract with the engineering consultants for the Guadalupe IV
hydro plant for continuation of their services until plant
completion (4.09).
(c)  EPM would enga,e, not later than December 31, 1981, consultants
for carrying o0t a study of development of its high voltage
transmission facilities, which would be completed by September 30,
1982, under acceptable terms and conditions (4.11).
(d) EPM would engage, not later than September 30, 1980, consultants
for final design, issue of bid document, and supervision of
construction, of the dispatch center, under acceptable terms
of reference (4.13).
(e) EPM would execute (in coordination with ISA) a satisfactory
training program for professional staff; this training program
would be completed by December 31, 1984 (4.14).
(f) EPM would increase its rates by 10% before June 1981, or take
equivalent actions to obtain the same funding in 1981, and
continue its monthly rate increase of up to 2.2% through
1983 (5.19).



- 44 -
7.02      Agreements have also been reached that the corresponding pro-
visions of Loans 874-CO, 1582-CO (San Carlos I) and 1725-CO (San Carlos II)
would be amended as follows:
(a) to extend the period for submitting external audit reports
from 4 to 5 months (874-CO, Loan Agreement, Section 5.02)
(2.09);
(b) to extend the dam and waterworks maintenance covenants
(874-CO, Loan Agreement Section 4.04(b)), to cover all of
EPM's dams and waterworks (4.20);
(c) EPM would achieve a rate of return of not less than
9% of 1980, 10.5% in 1981, 13% in 1982 and 1983 and
10% in 1984 and thereafter (1582-CO, 1725-CO, Share-
holders' Agreements, Section 5.02(a)) (5.20);
(d) to extend the lien covenants, now limited to EPM's power
department, to include all other service departments, and
as a consequence (i) to delete the covenant regulating debtors
to forego rights on EPM's assets (874-CO, Loan Agreement
Section 5.03(b) and 5.06) (5.21); (ii) extend the debt
service coverage test with a ratio of 1.5, to EPM's other
departments (1725-CO Shareholders Agreement, Section 5.11)
(5.21); and (iii) no later than 3 months after the end of
EPM's fiscal year, EPM would, for each of its departments,
furnish to the Bank a report showing EPM's financial per-
formance during that year and projected through the following
year (874-CO Loan Agreement, Section 5.02) (5.21); and
(e) The investment limitation covenant would also include:
EPM would seek Bank concurrence before committing itself
to capital expenditures (i) not directly related to the
operation of any of its departments; and (ii) made or to be
made in any one fiscal year (excluding those required for
the project, payments to ISA and for the investment program)
exceeding 1% of the net current value of its fixed assets
in operation (1582-CO, 1725-CO, Shareholders' Agreement,
Section 5.01) (5.23).
7.03      The following main provision of Loans 874-CO, 1582-CO and
1725-CO would be repeated.
(a) Amendment, etc. of EPM's statutes and adoption of new municipal
legislation, adversely affecting EPM, would be an event of
default (829-CO, Loan Agreement, Section 8.08) (2.03);
(b) Auditing and financial statements (874-CO, Loan Agreement,
Section 5.02) (2.09);
(c) Insurance against risk (874-CO, Loan Agreement, Section
4.02) (2.11);



- 45 -
(d)  Quarterly review of rates of return and adjustment of
rates (1727-Co, Shareholders' Agreement, Section 5.02(b)
and (c)) (5.20);
(e)  Debt service coverage ratio not less than 1.5 (1725-CO,
Shareholders' Agreement, Section 5.11) (5.20);
(f) Limitation of transfer of funds from the power to the
other departments and their independent operation
(874-CO, Loan Agreement, Section 5.01) (5.22); and
(g) EPM to establish and maintain for all of its services
adequate tariffs and financing (874-CO, Loan Agreement,
Section 5.07(a)) (5.24).
Conditions of Effectiveness
7.04      Prior to declaring the loan effective, evidence would be available
that EPM has made satisfactory arrangements for financing the balance of
financial requirements for the period 1980-1982 (5.13).
Recommendation
7.05      With the above assurances the project would be suitable for a Bank
loan of MUS$125 equivalent to be made to EPM with the guarantee of the
Government of Colombia. The loan would have a repayment period of 17 years,
including 4 years of grace.
