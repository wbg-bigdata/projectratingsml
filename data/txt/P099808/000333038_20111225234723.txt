F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall development objective of the project is to minimize the threat posed to humans and
the poultry industry in Georgia by HPAI and other zoonoses in domestic poultry, and to prepare
for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in
humans. To achieve this, three areas would be supported by the project: (i) prevention; (ii)
preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment.

1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Georgia was considered at extreme risk for the spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian
Influenza (HPAI) at the time of appraisal because of its border with eastern Turkey, in which 13
separate outbreaks in domestic poultry were reported as of the end of January 2006. A major
migratory bird flyway crosses from this direction over Georgia. Another flyway from the north
crosses over Georgia’s long border with Russia, where outbreaks in seven regions were reported,
with outbreaks in three regions bordering Georgia. Moreover, the outbreak in wild fowl and
domestic birds and the five human deaths from HPAI in Azerbaijan showed the tragic and
critical nature of the threat facing Georgia and its neighbors.

2.     Georgia reported its first case of avian influenza on February 21, 2006 when a dead swan
found at a lake in the Ajara region tested positive using real-time PCR testing. A second
migratory bird tested positive the following day, and the Government declared a State of
Emergency in Ajara.

3.      Responsibility for the surveillance and monitoring for HPAI in poultry and migratory
fowl and for response in case of outbreak rests with the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) which
undertook a major restructuring in 2006 with the goal of contracting out much of the services
provided by the Ministry to private contractors. On the other hand, the responsibility for
preparing for the threat of HPAI to human health rests with the Ministry of Labor, Health and
Social Affairs (MoLHSA) which also initiated health sector reforms in 1995. In both the
agricultural and health sectors, there were several IDA and other partner-funded projects under
implementation at appraisal that helped finance immediate needs for the avian influenza response.

4.      The rationale for Bank involvement was the Global Public Goods aspect of the HPAI,
one of the many emerging and re-emerging zoonoses, and its strong link to poverty reduction.
The Bank was well placed to build upon its knowledge of multi-disciplinary approaches needed
in the proposed project. Given the Bank’s work with FAO, WHO, OIE, USAID, EU and other
partners in the country and at the international level to address both preparedness and outbreaks,
the Bank could assist Georgia by bringing its technical assistance and leveraging additional
resources from other international and bilateral agencies.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.     The overall development objective of the project was to minimize the threat posed to
humans and the poultry industry in Georgia by HPAI and other zoonoses in domestic poultry,
and to prepare for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease
emergencies in humans. To achieve this, three areas would be supported by the project: (i)
prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment.

6.     The key indicators were: (i) evidence of an effective and inter-sectoral surveillance
system in place for both animals and humans for HPAI and other zoonoses; (ii) evidence of



                                                1
institutional mechanisms in place for effective implementation of an integrated and multi-
sectoral contingency plan for endemic preparedness; and (iii) contained outbreaks in poultry with
no demonstrated transmission from birds to humans.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/Justification

7.     The PDO was not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.       The main beneficiaries included humans threatened by HPAI infection and other
infectious disease emergencies. The PAD also refers to smallholders keeping poultry in their
backyards and large to medium commercial poultry farms producing both eggs and meat.
Institutional beneficiaries were the National Service for Veterinary and Food Safety Agency of
the MoA and its staff, and the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) of the MoLHSA and
its Central Reference Laboratory and staff.

1.5 Original Components

9.    The project had three components: (i) animal health; (ii) human health; and (iii) public
awareness and communication.

Component 1: Animal Health (US$5.18 million appraisal estimate, US$2.75 million actual)

10.     Strengthening the national HPAI preparedness and prevention capability through: (a)
strengthening of the regulatory and environment framework by providing technical assistance to
MoA for legal, regulatory and institutional review; (b) development of a national action and
contingency plan with focus on planning for an outbreak and detailing how a response to it
would be managed; and (c) establishment of a national compensation policy and fund.

11.     Strengthening disease surveillance, diagnosis and containment capacity through: (a)
strengthening the disease monitoring and containment system by supporting the public veterinary
services to bring them in line with OIE standards; (b) strengthening diagnostic capacity to
support the laboratory system; and (c) strengthening animal disease information systems to
improve the reporting of animal disease information from the field and the flow of information
among relevant agencies.

Component 2: Human Health (US$4.32 million appraisal estimate, US$4.95 million actual)

12.     Enhancing public health program planning and coordination through technical assistance
and training to MoLHSA to build its institutional capacity.

13.   Strengthening the national health surveillance systems support to improve the laboratory
network capacity and health information systems.




                                               2
14.    Strengthening the health system response capacity, including the diagnostic and treatment
guideline development, purchasing of necessary vaccines, medications, etc.

Component 3: Public Awareness and Communications (US$0.90 million appraisal estimate,
US$0.53 million actual)

15.    The component included promoting awareness and improving coordination of the
execution of the overall GoG’s contingency plan.

1.6 Revised Components

16.    Not applicable

1.7 Other significant changes

17.    Closing date extension. The closing date was extended twice: the first time for 18
months from August 31, 2009 to February 28, 2011 and the second time for four months from
February 28, 2011 to June 30, 2011 in order to allow the completion of planned activities.

18.     Revised/enhanced activities. Originally, the Project considered upgrading the existing
laboratory, including design and renovation that is required for Bio Safety Level 3 (BSL3) with
concomitant physical containment requirements, required for virus isolation and sub-typing to
determine various strains. However, during project implementation, this option was reconsidered
and cancelled given that the virus can be detected in a BSL 2 laboratory using PCR equipment
that already exists in the laboratories and the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) was
building a BSL 3 laboratory that would eventually become available. The savings were used for
procurement of seven ambulance cars distributed to four referral centers throughout the country.

19.     With regards to the African Swine Flu (ASF) outbreak in 2007, while the FAO ASF
project support included specific communication, epidemiology training related to ASF and
technical assistance and support for laboratory diagnosis, the AI Project supported the more
generic elements of AI and systemic improvements that had a broader application. Therefore, it
was not necessary to restructure the Project, but the ASF issues could be covered under the FAO
project. The project provided urgent international technical assistance for assessment of the ASF
risks and recommendations for immediate control programs.

20.     Furthermore, given the flexibility in the project design, although not originally planned in
the project, some serious gaps in health care preparedness and response were discovered during
its implementation that were either directly or indirectly linked to the project main objectives.
The additional activities were therefore proposed by the borrower and approved by the Bank to
contribute to further improvement of the quality of health care services in Georgia: (i) revision of
National Influenza Clinical Guidelines and Protocols by including Health Care Associated
Infection Control Strategy 2011-2015; (ii) development of Blood Safety Strategy and
Operational Plan for 2011-2015 and; (iii) clinical waste management.




                                                 3
21.    Cancellation of funds. As no compensation was made to farmers, the allocated amount
of US$1.6 million was finally canceled and reserved for future IDA financing for the Georgia
program.

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22.     The project was prepared within the framework of the GPAI and under the provisions of
the Bank’s emergency policy guidelines (OP/BP 8.50). At an early stage of outbreak Georgia
qualified as a country at risk. The project by its design was an emergency project, although it did
contain many elements aimed at institutional development. It emphasized preparedness as a key
factor to control a possible pandemic and most activities were elaborated along this line. This
project had to contend with the same dichotomy of competing objectives as the other AI projects
under the GPAI in that emergency preparedness required investments in longer-term systemic
and institution-building interventions. To prevent the spread of HPAI among birds and humans,
the Project contained a two-pronged strategy: (i) the control of HPAI at the source in high-risk
regions and (ii) simultaneously preparation of short- and medium-term measures to minimize the
risks to humans and prepare for an eventual pandemic. Project preparation not only included
analysis in applying the Bank’s global experience in good practice in HPAI response and
mitigation to the specific situation, but also significantly drew on existing initiatives from other
donors to assure preparedness in fighting avian influenza.

23.     Overall, the preparation and design stage could be considered a good example of efficient
and effective collaboration among relevant stakeholders in situations of public health threats
such as the AI. WHO and FAO provided rapid assessments of the situation in Georgia, along
with technical backstopping in the preparation of contingency plans for AI and for the
preparation of a coordinated program for donor assistance. At the time of preparation, several
donors were already supporting the Government’s HPAI strategy. USAID was providing support
for HPAI through technical assistance and equipment for MoLHSA and MoA, as well as for a
communication campaign. EU also provided support for the response to the threat of HPAI
through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund of Avian Influenza. The US DoD DTRA program was
concurrently supporting laboratory upgrading that included HPAI diagnosis. All potential needs
for a broad-based avian influenza preparedness program was roughly estimated and the proposed
project was designed to meet priority medium term investment needs aimed at strengthening the
capacity of both the animal health and human health agencies to respond to the threat of an HPAI
outbreak.

24.      Project design incorporated relevant lessons from implementation of projects in the
agricultural and health sectors in Georgia and from design of previous Bank/IDA and FAO-
supported emergency recovery projects. These included: (i) simplicity in project design and
taking into account a realistic assessment of country’s absorption capacity; (ii) inclusion of
mitigation and prevention measures to minimize impacts of a possible recurrence of the disaster;
(iii) effective communication and coordination mechanisms among relevant stakeholders; (iii)
compensation framework to obtain cooperation from affected farmers and to ensure the efficacy
of the surveillance and diagnosis mechanisms. Specifically, the design focused on developing a

helped improve capacity to prevent, identify, contain and eradicate HPAI outbreaks and deal
with a potential pandemic should that contingency develop.

25.     The project was prepared and carried out as an emergency response project with
flexibility and options to adapt according to changing threats and corresponding needs.
Subsequently, revision/adjustment became justified, as anticipated further HPAI outbreaks did
not occur and, therefore, the compensation fund was not drawn upon. In addition, the risk of an
African Swine Flu and the actual H1N1 pandemics that occurred during implementation were
addressed with project resources. The project organization, with both ministries of health and
agriculture responsible for specific components, was logical and fitted with their respective
mandates. The project had a comprehensive list of 43 key indicators. There might have been
scope to streamline project supervision, had a more refined list of indicators been defined during
project preparation.

26.    The Government actively participated in project design, through consultation with the
inter-ministerial Task Force (IMTF) chaired by the Deputy MoLHSA and included Ministry of
Agriculture, Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Defense,
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, Customs Department, Public
Health Department, National Center for Disease Control, Drug Agency and Infectious Disease
Hospital, WHO, WB, UNICEF, and USAID.

27.      Regardless of its design that focused on the key elements for optimizing risk reduction,
the complexity of some interventions led to considerable implementation delays for a number of
activities, significant redesign of some planned activities (e.g. BLS-2 instead of BLS-3) and
failure to implement others altogether (e.g., establishment of national compensation fund,
construction of the border inspection posts (BIP), some laboratory equipment for NCDC).

2.2 Implementation

28.     Implementation benefitted from the fact that both line ministries with a principal stake in
the Project, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, sustained interest in the
Project throughout implementation and each had existing and experienced project coordination
centers (PCC). Counterpart funding was adequate and provided in a timely fashion. Financial
management was satisfactory and all audit reports were provided on time and were found
satisfactory. Procurement, however, was plagued by delays and retendering. Procurement was
further hampered by complex procedures and sometimes unrealistic demands by the Bank that
did not match the limited number and capacities of local providers of medical equipment.
Permanently ongoing reforms in both MoA and MoLHSA and subsequent staffing changes, as
well as within the project, also led in some cases to delay of decisions on procurement.

29.     Components I and II were, with some notable exceptions, largely implemented, although
the project’s closing date had to be extended twice for 22 months to ensure this. With regards to
Component III (Public Awareness and Communications) most of the originally planned activities
had been implemented by other donors, leading to less anticipated spending under this
component. However, overall, adequate support had been provided for the information and



                                                5
communication activities to increase the attention of the government, private sector, and civil
society organizations, and to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general
population about the risk and potential impact of the different zoonoses.

30.      The Project Implementation Team (PIT), comprising the two component managers and
representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the prime Minister’s office, meant to ensure the
overall coordination of project management, was affected by political disruptions and failed to
meet for some time during the course of project implementation, leading to significant delays in
the decision-making process. Project implementation also suffered from a number of institutional
and organizational decisions due to political and economic reforms that affected both Ministry of
Agriculture and Ministry of Health leading to sweeping changes in the system, its financing and
its staffing (very high staff turnover). Despite these frequent changes of composition because of
ongoing changes in the ministries, the implementation team had both the mandate and the
committed core permanent staff that allowed making operational decisions and changes as the
needs appeared.

31.      Project management deteriorated somehow towards the end as both line implementation
ministries decided to change arrangements for project implementation in their respective sectors.
The PCC under the MoA underwent a liquidation process and no new activities could be
undertaken during the last six months, while the PCC under the MoLHSA was transferred to the
National Center for Disease Control (NCDC). All these changes delayed implementation during
a critical period before project closing.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.     Rather inadequate attention was given to the M&E design during project appraisal
although the M&E system and the list of key indicators covered the PDO adequately both in
quantitative and qualitative terms. During implementation the M&E activities were carried out
by the respective PCCs in the two line ministries. However, only the Human Health and
Communication components had an effective M&E system while the M&E for the Animal
Health component was more of an ad-hoc nature, did not keep up-to-date M&E records and did
not produce regular project reports. However, the Bank missions could obtain all needed
data/information on a demand basis.

33.    Project monitoring was complicated by the Results Framework having as many as 43
intermediate outcome indicators, some of which were simply activity indicators. The M&E
design could have been simpler with fewer key indicators.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

34.    The project was classified as Environmental Category B as its investments in physical
works were limited to small construction. Postmortem (PM) rooms were designed and built in
four municipalities of the country. No land acquisition was required as the PM rooms were
constructed within the State-owned land plots already used by the Ministry of Agriculture.
Therefore, OP 4.12 was not triggered.




                                               6
35.      Site-specific environmental management plans for the construction of PM rooms were
developed according to the requirements of OP/BP 4.01 prior to inviting construction contractors
to bid. Environmental Management Checklist for Small Construction and Rehabilitation
Activities was used for this purpose due to modest scale of works. EMPs provided mitigation
measures for the construction phase as well as necessary arrangements for safe operation of the
facilities, such as for: (i) disposal of biological waste, sharps and other laboratory refuse, (ii)
waste water treatment, and (iii) personnel safety and biological security. Construction works
were conducted generally in good compliance with the EMPs.

36.     Overall Safeguard compliance is rated as satisfactory. Procurement and FM were found
to be moderately satisfactory and satisfactory, respectively, by the end of the Project. There
were three FM actions relating to AIP project agreed during the negotiations, of which two on
the staffing and on the Financial Management Manual have been implemented, while the third
action relating to Compensation Fund was not applicable, as the latter was not established under
the Project.

37.      There were procurement delays in all three components that resulted in some activities
not being implemented. However, most were accomplished though with delays, for example: (i)
intra-hospital infection control and bacterial resistance; (ii) zoonotic diseases management; and
(iii) crisis communication management. The Project was regularly supervised by the FM and
procurement specialists. Audit reports for FY 2006 through FY 2010 were delivered on time
with clean (unmodified) opinions issued.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

38.     The project helped ensure that preparedness and adequate response are in place and both
specific target groups and general public are informed about the pandemic and ways to protect
themselves from infection. The system was tested during the ASF outbreaks and again during the
moderately severe H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and withstood the challenge. As a result, both
knowledge and experience are now in place, and it can be assumed that it would be able to cope
also with future epidemics, pandemics and other natural and even man-made disasters of a
limited scope because of the small amount of knowledge, laboratory and medical equipment
available at the moment.

39.     The challenge remains to ensure that the recently acquired knowledge and experience
remains intact and/or evolves. To prevent the loss of accumulated knowledge and experience,
periodic training and other activities such as tabletop and field simulation exercises and
education of the public concerning pandemic and similar emergencies would be needed. The
Government should commit to maintaining and streamlining the coordination structure such as
PIT as it has proven its great value, especially during the pandemic in 2009.

40.     The ongoing reforms in the health sector aim primarily at privatizing medical services
and emphasizing decentralization, by shifting the part of the budget now spent on large
administrative structure to increase financing of the primary health care services. Consequently,
it is expected that budgetary allocation for MoLHSA could be reduced over time. Budgetary
sustainability is thus a serious concern. However, GoG committed to pay for compensation in



                                                7
case of an outbreak of avian influenza or other animal diseases which could require culling and
compensation, and various donor agencies show interest in further support to build on the
momentum of outcomes achieved in the health sector. Moreover, the ongoing negotiations for
the Free Trade Agreement with EU have put pressure on the Government to adopt a national
food safety strategy and undertake necessary institutional changes for animal health and
transboundary disease control. The Government is, therefore, motivated to maintain and continue
to upgrade the laboratory network, animal health surveillance and disease control reforms for
which the avian influenza project has served as an initial catalyst. The Performance of Veterinary
Services Pathway, which is supported by the World Animal Health Organization (OIE) and was
initiated under the avian influenza project, has provided the basis for reform of the veterinary
services. This process would continue as a necessary next step in WTO and EU compliance for
animal health and trade.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

41.     The PDO reflected a proper diagnosis of Georgia’s priorities and was aligned to the
GPAI PDO. The central element of the PDO, that is, to minimize the threat posed to humans by
both avian and human pandemic disease caused by A/H5N1 and HPAI, remains very valid, as
the risk of this contingency continues up to and beyond project completion. The objectives and
design are consistent with Georgia’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, for the period 2009-
2013).

42.    Project objectives, design and implementation remain highly relevant for Georgia today.
The country’s health services and especially its animal health services are today much better
prepared and equipped to detect and respond to outbreaks for highly infectious diseases. The
outbreaks of AFS in 2007 and the appearance of the A/H1N1 swine flu virus in 2009 indicate the
importance of having in place effective disease surveillance, diagnostic, control, and treatment
capabilities. The investments in communication and multi-sectoral collaboration were beneficial
in preparing the ground to swiftly respond to the outbreaks.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

43.      The two basic elements of the PDO were to: (i) minimize the threat posed to humans and
the poultry industry by HPAI infection and other zoonoses; and (ii) prepare for the control and
response to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans. Project
activities/output emphasized three areas: (i) support to animal health; (ii) support to human
health; and (iii) strategic communication. The causal linkage can be summarized as follows:

PDO 1: Minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry industry by HPAI infection
and other zoonoses

44.     Disease control capabilities were not tested for HPAI (but ASF and H1N1 were
successfully tested) as there was no outbreak during the project; however, it is reasonable to
assume that the interventions in this area have contributed to achieving the PDO of reducing the
probability of both contained and widespread outbreaks. The main outputs and outcomes are
listed below, and described further in Annex 2. Effective and inter-sectoral surveillance system
for both animal and humans for HPAI and other zoonoses as well as institutional mechanism for
effective implementation of a contingency for epidemic preparedness have been put in place.
These have all contributed to minimizing the threat of HPAI and other zoonoses

45.      National HPIA preparedness and prevention capability strengthened. The veterinary
services regulatory and institutional environment was improved. The OIE conducted the PVS
assessment of veterinary services which provided important guidance on how to direct
investments in the veterinary services. The National Contingency Plan integrating both the
human and veterinary aspects, and detailed responsibilities, obligations and measures was
finalized and approved by the Government. Training was provided to the staff of the National
Service for Veterinary and Food Safety (NS). However, no legal framework and policy for
compensating for culling of animals for disease control purposes was enacted, although a
compensation manual was developed and the Government expressed its commitment to
compensate farmers in case of an outbreak of avian influenza or other animal diseases which
could require culling and compensation.

46.     Disease surveillance, diagnostic and containment capacity strengthened. A monitoring
plan for epidemiological surveillance was developed; emergency supplies (disinfectants,
protective gear, masks, and reagents) and Personal Protection Equipment (PPEs) were procured
and made available at strategic locations in the field. Additionally, surgical instruments,
multipurpose sprayers, automatic sprayers and eight 4WD vehicles were procured to
accommodate the transportation of sprayers. The capacity of regional laboratories and rayon
National Service offices was strengthened for improved surveillance. For example, the Rustavi
regional NS office was rehabilitated and a new regional NS office was constructed in Poti, as
well as post mortem / necropsy rooms constructed in the central veterinary laboratory in Tbilisi
and three regional laboratories (Gurjaani, Kutaisi and Akhaltsikhe).




                                               9
47.     A national disease surveillance and information system integrating the ten key regional
centers was developed. Emergency offices were established in high-risk areas, with a ‘hotline’
for people to call with any suspicious information. The ability of the emergency centers to
respond has been improved through provision of 30 vehicles, which contributed to improve the
response time. DTRA provided the major support for the integrated information system, through
provision of software, equipment and training. However, the inter-sectoral collaboration for an
effective surveillance system for both animal and human health still needs to be improved,
especially regarding the relations between the laboratories under the different entities (NCDC,
MoA and DTRA) need to be clarified.

48.      Public health program planning, coordination and surveillance systems enhanced. A
comprehensive National Influenza Preparedness Plan was developed and adopted by the
Government and training involving medical and non-medical personnel were provided, as well
as a table-top simulation exercise for various stakeholders organized. The preparation, approval
and operationalization, together with the first training concluded by October 2009 was timely,
just at the onset on H1N1 pandemic in Georgia that started in November 2009 and reached its
peak in January 2010. Because of this Plan and its guidelines, the authorities and health care
workers were aware of needed actions and able to contain and control the developing pandemic.
In addition, procedures described in avian influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness
and Response Operational Plan stipulated clearly duties and responsibilities of each actor and
provided for better coordination among involved agencies.

49.     Institutional capacities to command and control in a coordinated manner under the
contingency plan were developed. The original plan of upgrading existing laboratory with the
purchase of mobile BSL 3 lab was abandoned, given that the virus can be easily detected in a
BSL 2 laboratory (under BSL3 equivalent protocols and with appropriate biohazard hoods) using
PCR equipment that already exists and, in addition, DTRA was building a BSL 3 laboratory. It
was considered adequate to use strengthened laboratory systems and sufficiently stringent
protocols at BSL 2 (Batumi, Kutaisi and Tbilisi). Capacity of regional laboratories increased
twofold (from 30 to 60 real time tests per day) and that of NRL of NCDC fourfold (from 60 to
240 tests per day). Nevertheless, limited amount of reagents has led to decision to do all testing
in Tbilisi at NCDC and in the regions, in special cases, to use rapid tests. NCDC laboratory, at
the height of the epidemic, worked around the clock and did up to 300 tests per day. The project
also supported the Central Reference Lab (CRL) to develop its strategy and Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs), as well as certification and accreditation options for the CRL. Blood/serum
bank plans and a five-year operational plan were developed and health information system has
been improved through support of hot lines for both veterinary as well as health sectors,
alongside other donors such as EU, USAID and DTRA who also supported the information
system through the ongoing Health Care Sector Development Project.

50.    Overall, the National Plan greatly assisted all involved in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, but
was developed with more than 2 years delay (fortunately, no pandemic occurred between 2007
and 2009).

PDO 2: Prepare for, control, and respond to influenza epidemics and other infectious
disease emergencies in humans

51.      Health systems response capacity strengthened. To respond promptly and adequately, an
Emergency Response Unit at MoLHSA was established at the beginning of the project (in 2007)
with a broad mandate – to collect all requests from all over the country concerning the outbreak,
to arrange transport of patients, containment, provision of antiviral drugs and vaccinations. This
emergency unit has been established for all emergencies where rapid and appropriate response
was needed. The project supported revision of the Georgian law on Emergency Situations (#972)
from 1997, which was further elaborated on “social distancing measures?. This has given
authorities and health system power to take timely and appropriate social distancing action
without time-consuming procedures. As a result, during the H1N1pandemic of 2009, quarantine
and isolation were enforced, mostly at home or otherwise at the hospital. At main borders,
visitors were informed about the pandemic and advised about protection and symptoms of
possible infection but following the international (and National Plan) guidelines no measures
restricting personal freedom were used.

52.     As preparation for eventual pandemic, in total 610 Primary Health Care (PHC) providers
were trained to provide first assistance to the population and village level; 1,245.000 face masks
and 512.000 pairs of gloves were purchased and distributed among the PHC facilities. In major
hospitals, isolation units were established and during the pandemic in 2009, an additional 400
beds were added to Tbilisi hospitals. Hospitals were additionally equipped by the project with
patient monitors, resuscitation (artificial respirators) and PPE. The project also procured and
distributed 14,000 doses of seasonal trivalent vaccines and 56 kg of Tamiflu. Also, 7 specialized
ambulances with possibility of artificial respiration were purchased and provided to regional and
central hospitals. As a result of the improvements of the health system and the health care
workers’ performance, the virtual absence of panic among the population during the 2009
pandemic (especially in comparison to 2006) and relatively low mortality rate (2.6%) suggest an
adequate response of the health care system to the emergency.

53.      Awareness promoted and overall coordination of GoG’s contingency plan improved.
Public awareness activities were conducted on an ongoing basis supported through the project
and different other agencies like UNICEF and USAID. More specifically, the project contributed
to: (i) the development and maintenance of a multilingual AI website (www.avianflu.ge); (ii) the
preparation and distribution of the pre-outbreak information materials for stakeholders; (iii)
generic communication topics that addressed AI prevention and control and at the same time
include a broader scope of zoonotic and general health concerns identified by the KAPS survey;
(iv) extensive training on how to communicate the key messages related to the pandemic
influenza; and (v) behavioral impact campaigns. In addition, the project established 6 sentinel
points at PHC centers across the country that report now weekly to NCDC via a newly


                                               11
established electronic system. The information was passed also to the European branch of the
WHO and can be monitored by outsiders on the WHO website. During the 2009 pandemic, the
information was available daily for timely response by health authorities.

54.     Overall, the PDO - to minimize the threat in Georgia posed to humans by HPAI infection
and other zoonoses and prepare for control and response to an influenza pandemic and other
infectious disease emergencies in humans - has been largely achieved. The human health aspects
have been fully achieved. This was best demonstrated by the Government timely and exemplary
response to the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. The surveillance system was well set up at different
levels through Georgia and response mechanism could adequately deal with the 2009 pandemic.
In terms of the animal health system development, the response capacity was tested during the
African Swine Fever (ASF) outbreak, when the disease was reported within 48 hours and, once
confirmed in the newly refurbished national laboratory, international technical assistance and
control program expertise was sought by the Government and provided under the avian influenza
project. All institutional mechanisms are now in place to implement a well-elaborated
contingency plan, followed by appropriate training and provision of equipment. Although during
(limited) outbreak in birds in 2006, no human transmission took place, the established system of
surveillance, emergency response and communication can be assumed to be in position to deal
adequately with any future outbreak of birds or animal-linked pandemic. Nevertheless, while
both animal and human surveillance systems have been improved and an integrated lab
management system for public health and veterinary services under the National Reference
Laboratory (NRL) has been designed, the inter-sectoral collaboration has still to be further
strengthened. Although the laboratory network has been improved and has the capacity to
respond, there is a need to improve the collaboration amongst the laboratories under the different
agencies (NCDC, MoA and DTRA). Though the institutional and infrastructure aspects have
been adequately dealt with to upgrade prevention, and surveillance, there are some moderate
shortcomings such as the failure to establish a fully functioning compensation fund which is an
important element in the response and control of animal disease outbreaks.

3.3 Efficiency

55.     The analysis undertaken at project completion employs a simple model that is based on
the assumption that the key impact of the pandemic influenza is going to be the reduction of
poultry stock due to mandatory culling and transmission of the disease to humans with possible
effects of mortality and morbidity. It is assumed that an outbreak with a mutated virulent virus
would occur every five years, with the first one in 2011, at the project completion. The project
benefits are expressed as the expected value of the economic losses avoided over the period of
2011-2025 in the “With Project? scenario versus the “Without Project Scenario?.

56.    The estimated benefits are the human hospitalizations costs averted, the income losses
avoided due to reduced rates of infection, and the production losses of poultry meat and eggs
averted. Other benefits, such as the much improved capacity to detect and respond to other
zoonoses and infectious diseases, or the reduction in scale and cost of poultry culling and
possible compensation measures due to better surveillance and control are not considered.
Secondary effects, such as the prevention of abrupt and severe changes in poultry prices on farm
incomes or consumer incomes and of cross-price elasticity effects on other livestock subsectors,
were also ignored.


                                               12
57.    For the base case, the incidence of HPAI infection among the human population (Gross
Attack Rate) was estimated at 5%, with 10% of those affected requiring hospitalization and 3%
of those affected dying from the disease (the Without-Project scenario). 1 The With-Project
scenario estimates are that only 2% of the population would be affected by HPAI infection, with
10% of the affected being hospitalized and a death rate of only 1.5% among those affected.

58.    The results of the analysis show a 50 % ERR, a benefit-cost ratio of 2.54 and a NPV of
US$ 22.9 million. Assigning only 50% of the human health benefits to the project, the analysis
shows a 28% ERR, a benefit-cost ratio of 0.77 and a NPV of US$6.9 million.

59.     The human health benefits substantially outweigh those in the poultry production sector.
The two parameters that drive the economic value of the human health benefits are: (i) the
project impact on the percentage of the human population affected by HPAI infection, and (ii)
the project effectiveness in reducing the expected mortality rate from HPAI infection. Project
benefits are primarily driven by key assumptions regarding the gross attack rate for the human
population and for the mortality rate among those affected as well as by the likely frequency of
HPAI outbreaks. This is to be expected in a project that is intended to prepare for a contingency
for which neither timing nor severity can be reliably predicted.

60.     Another measure of project efficiency is cost effectiveness. Due to the valuable
collaboration with USAID, UNICEF and DTRA (both in terms of funds and human resources)
several of the originally planned activities were implemented with financial support from other
donors, and additional new activities were undertaken to support the PDO.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.     The project followed a template under GPAI PAD for Bank projects in a number of
countries to address the threat of HPAI. It proved to be relevant for Georgia and was aligned
with the CPS. Flexibility was shown in project implementation when HPAI outbreaks did not
occur. Thus, objectives and design maintained their relevance throughout the project. The human
health aspects have been fully achieved. However, one of the intermediate PDO indicators -
effective inter-sectoral surveillance systems in place for both animals and humans for HPAI and
other zoonoses could be further enhanced and the compensation fund has not been established.
Therefore, it is concluded that the project achieved its PDO, but with moderate shortcomings.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

62.    Women and children are key actors in backyard poultry sector and, thus, key
beneficiaries of the project. Backyard poultry is an important contributor to rural livelihoods for

                                                                    13
poorer people. The project’s poverty and gender impacts – through the avoidance of losses of
livestock and income and the payment of compensation for culling – are potentially significant.
The public awareness campaign specifically targeted school children, amongst others.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

63.      The project has significantly contributed to the strengthening of the beneficiary
institutions in both the veterinary and the human health sectors. Epidemiological surveillance,
disease monitoring, laboratory diagnostics, treatment capabilities have been improved through
investments in training, equipment, development of strategies/guidelines, and revision/enacting
of laws. These capacities have been successfully tested during the ASF and H1N1 pandemics.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

64.     During project implementation, several flaws in existing health service system were
identified such as inappropriate hospital waste management, relative high risk of hospital
acquired infections and gaps in safe blood collection and transfusion. Because of the project’s
flexibility, appropriate research was carried out and new regulations put in place, along with
training of all those involved. This additional element will have a positive influence on the
quality of health care provision after the end of the project.

65.    The strengthening of the health services and the communication strategies had a positive
impact on effective management of human A/H1N1 cases. In addition to preparing Georgia for
A/H1N1, emergency planning has prepared the authorities for other severe emergencies,
including floods and major (e.g. traffic) accidents.

4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Moderate

67.     Overall, the risk to sustaining the project outcome is moderate, mainly because of the
uncertain prospects of adequate future budgetary support for the operation as ongoing reforms in
Georgia are strongly affecting the MoLHSA. The challenge remains to keep the recently
acquired knowledge and experience intact. The risk of project implementing agencies not having
sufficient authority, leadership and capacity to take leading role in AI prevention and control
rated as substantial at appraisal is now moderate due to the implementation of mitigation
measures.

5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.     The project was very relevant, and its preparation and design stages could be considered
a good example of efficient and effective collaboration among relevant stakeholders. The Bank
team brought knowledge of global good practice as defined in the GPAI PAD and applied it
according to the specific country scenario, that is, in the context of recent HPAI outbreaks in a
diffuse poultry sector with predominantly smallholder, backyard management. The project was
planned at a time of urgency and uncertainty about HPAI. However, at appraisal a number of
important issues were not fully developed. Some planned activities could not be implemented
because they were inadequately prepared and appraised and proved to be unrealistic (e.g. BLS3
lab acquisition). The Results Framework and the M&E arrangements were overly complex.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.    The Bank team properly understood the design of the project, which was more of an
emergency preparedness and response rather than a development project. This is reflected in
their understanding and flexibility during implementation. Some unnecessary activities were
dropped, such as equipment of BSL 3 level laboratory, while others were added, usually on
request of MoLHSA such as additional research and training of safe blood supply, medical waste
management and nosocomial infections, all having link to possible epidemics in Georgia.

70.     Throughout the project, supervision missions effectively identified and resolved any
threats to achievement of the PDO. The Bank fielded seven supervision missions between the
summer 2006 and summer 2011; they all included health and veterinary specialists, a
communication/operations specialist, and procurement and FM specialists. Other positive aspects
of Bank supervision included the proactive approach to collaboration and coordination with other
donors and projects. Safeguards and fiduciary aspects were adequately covered.

71.     However, overall, the quality of supervision was mixed, satisfactory on financial
management, procurement, but less satisfactory on some technical issues. For example, the
Results Framework and M&E arrangements were not refined, and integrated client reports were
not developed by the implementation agencies. Only the MoLHSA-PCC regularly prepared and
submitted semi-annual reports as required under the provision of the Financial Agreement, but
the MoA-PCC never did. Progress reporting from the client side therefore took place mostly
orally during the supervision missions or by phone and videoconferences.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.    The rating reflects both “MS? rating for Ensuring Quality at Entry and “MS? rating for
Quality of Supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.     The Government was closely engaged in project identification and preparation, and
remained fully committed to the project and its objectives. Adequate counterpart funding was
provided. However, permanently ongoing reforms in Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of
Labor, Health, and Social Affairs, and subsequent staffing changes, led to delays in decision
making process and implementation of activities. Moreover, project management was affected
by the decisions of both ministries of changing arrangements for project implementation in their
respective sectors during the last six months, a critical period before project closing. Also, failure
to implement the steps required to establish the Compensation Fund was a notable shortcoming.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.     Overall, the implementing agencies demonstrated strong commitment to achieving the
objectives across all components. Despite the noted constraints, the MoLHSA implemented its
project activities effectively, fitting them with other ongoing activities funded by other donors.

75.     With regards to the animal health component, in spite of the several internal
reorganizations and management changes of the NS, coupled with the influence of external
factors (the EU taking the lead in the legislative, institutional and strategic orientation of the NS),
the component achieved significant results. However, the establishment of a national
compensation policy and fund was not achieved, while the physical upgrading of border control
and the development of an animal disease information system were only partially achieved.

76.     Some procurement processes were delayed and retendering occurred in several instances.
Sometimes the bidding documents did not match interest or capacity of providers, or the
allocated contract time was miscalculated and had to be extended. Procurement was further
hampered by complex procedures and sometimes unrealistic demands that were not matching
limited number and capacities of local providers of medical equipment.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Implementing Agencies’ Performance.

6. LESSONS LEARNED

78.     Coordination and good strategic communication is key to contain a pandemic.
During the simulation exercise, the threatening pandemic of 2008 and the limited pandemic in
2009-2010, the appropriately established lines of communication among main players have
proven to be fundamental to the success of the actions. The established hot line for the public has
proven to be very helpful and prevented panic. In case of a larger outbreak, coordination will be
crucial and will need as short lines of communication as possible.

79.    Flexibility in the design and implementation of an emergency project is important.
Besides adequate coordination, speed and flexibility plays a dominant role. The appearance of
avian influenza strain mobilized and energized the authorities and sped up the set-up of an
adequate and fast tracing of suspected cases and immediate response. Shift from avian influenza
to H1N1 strain in 2009 demanded prompt response. Fortunately, due to flexibility and quick
response of IDA and other donors this was possible, resulting in a more appropriate and targeted
approach.

80.     Development of a contingency plan is beneficial. Georgian authorities in different
sectors have worked closely together to develop a contingency plan. This multi-sectoral
collaboration has proven to be very fruitful and has created synergy – it yielded better results
than if different ministries had worked separately. Especially, MoA and MoLHSA found quickly
that they had common interests. Authorities have now an effective system in place that can be
used in other emergency situations such as floods or other major accidents.

81.      Monitoring and evaluation need to be streamlined. Too many key indicators for an
emergency project can make monitoring and evaluation cumbersome. Data collection and
analysis can be an overwhelming task, particularly when there is no full-time staff responsible
for it. The project’s M&E system could have been simpler, with fewer key indicators.

                               Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Animal Health

1.      At the beginning of the project the Veterinary Service under the Ministry of Agriculture
was transformed into the National Service for Veterinary and Food Safety (NS), an agency under
the Ministry of Agriculture. The starting of discussions with the EU on the Deep and
Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement in early 2009 made the EU the main partner for the
dialogue on legislative, institutional and strategic orientation of the NS, and consequently the
Bank financing thereafter filled mainly the staff training and technical infrastructure gaps.
Frequent changes in the leadership and staffing of the NS, as well as the lack of an adopted
Veterinary and Food Safety Strategy made implementation of this component challenging. The
adoption of the Food Safety Strategy, as well as the transformation of the NS into a Legal Entity
under the Public Law was achieved in early 2011. Despite the several internal reorganizations
and the influence of external factors, the Animal Health component achieved good results and
contributed to minimizing the threat in Georgia posed to humans by HPAI and other zoonoses,
and prepare for control and response to an influenza pandemic and other infectious disease
emergencies. However, some of the indicators (e.g. the establishment of a national compensation
policy and fund) were not achieved, while other indicators (e.g. the upgrading of border controls)
were only partly achieved.

A. Strengthening National HPIA Preparedness and Prevention Capability

2.      A1. Strengthening the Regulatory and Institutional Environment. The OIE conducted the
PVS assessment of veterinary services. Consultants contracted by USDA and other donors
finalized the National Animal Health Program, which was blended with the PVS and Gap
Analysis as part of the national strategic plan for reform of veterinary services. The PVS
provided important guidance on how to direct investments in the veterinary services, including
private practitioners, and on reviewing and rationalizing the legislative and organizational
framework for the veterinary services. Staff of the National Service for Veterinary and Food
Safety (NS) was extensively trained, following a training of trainers approach. About 30 staff
from NS were trained in Latvia in short courses specially designed and which covered the
following topics: (i) On-farm quality assurance for raw materials; (ii) Controls of food and
animal origin; (iii) Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP); (iv) Food and Hygiene
Controls; (v) EU Food Standards; (vi) EU Food Legislation; (vii)Animal welfare; (viii) Plant
Health Controls; (ix) Risk Analysis (assessment, management and communication); and (x)
Control on Food and Feed of animal and non-animal origin.

3.      A2. National Action and Contingency Plan. The national Contingency Plan was finalized
and approved by the Government. The plan integrates both the human and veterinary aspects,
and details responsibilities, obligations and measures to be taken by the various institutions
involved. Desktop simulations were conducted and training delivered as part of preparation of
the Plan.

4.     A3. Establishment of a National Compensation Policy and Fund. The Project included
SDR 1 million (US$ 1.6 equivalent) for setting up a Compensation Fund, developing clear
operating procedures and training key players in conducting compensation payments at the local


                                               19
level. A Compensation Manual was developed under the Project, but not approved by the
Government and a Compensation Fund was not established. No legal framework and policy for
compensating for culling of animals for disease control purposes was enacted. In 2008, the task
team recommended that if a final Government decision to approve the Manual was not made by
end of 2008, the financing allocation for the Compensation Fund be cancelled. However, the
Ministry of Finance requested the Bank to retain the compensation allocation under the project,
under the condition that any use of proceeds from this allocation will be preceded by joint
agreement on the course of action to be applied by the Government. In a letter addressed to the
Bank, the Government expressed its commitment that in case of an outbreak of avian influenza
or other animal diseases which could require culling and compensation, it would help affected
farmers to bear losses stemming from actions to contain the spread of the disease, taking into
account related feasibility and affordability constraints. Until project end, no compensation was
used and the allocated amount was finally canceled and reserved for future IDA financing for the
Georgia program.

B. Strengthening Disease Surveillance, Diagnostic and Containment Capacity

5.      B1. Strengthening the Disease Monitoring and Containment System. A monitoring plan
for epidemiological surveillance was developed, including establishment of baselines, passive
and active surveillance, and regular data collection and analysis. Emergency supplies
(disinfectants, protective gear, masks, and reagents) were procured and made available at
strategic locations in the field. Additionally, surgical instruments, multipurpose sprayers,
automatic sprayers and eight 4WD vehicles to accommodate the transportation of sprayers were
procured. Also, based on EU technical requirements, the project provided technical assistance
support for the designs of five Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) in Red Bridge, Sarpi, Sadakhlo,
Poti and Tbilisi International Airport. The BIPs are established under the Custom Administration
within the Ministry of Finance, and will improve veterinary checks and phytosanitary controls in
order to avoid the entry of infectious animal diseases, common animal and human infectious
diseases and plant diseases and plant pests from other countries to the territory of Georgia and to
ensure the safety of food, fodder and primary products imported into Georgia. The project should
have also supported the construction of the BIPs, as well as essential laboratory testing facilities
at the five main border inspection posts. This was however not achieved. The Ministry of
Finance confirmed its intention to use budgetary resources to follow up with constructing and
equipping the BIPs based on technical assistance and detailed designed provided under the
Project.

6.      B2. Strengthening the Diagnostic Capacity. Capacity of regional laboratories and rayon
National Service offices was strengthened for improved surveillance. The Rustavi regional NS
office has been rehabilitated and a new regional NS office has been constructed in Poti. Post
mortem/necropsy rooms were designed and constructed as part of the regional MoA laboratory
network in the central veterinary laboratory in Tbilisi and three regional laboratories (Gurjaani,
Kutaisi and Akhaltsikhe). Construction of the necropsy rooms were finalized, and meets the
principles of biosafety and environmental standards for control of discharges, effluents and
infected materials to prevent environmental contamination or exposure to infectious agents.

7.     B3. Strengthening the Animal Disease Information System. The project supported the
development of a national disease surveillance and information system integrating the ten key


                                                20
regional centers. Emergency offices have been established in high-risk areas, with a ‘hotline’ for
people to call with any suspicious information. The ability of the emergency centers to respond
has been improved through provision of 30 vehicles, which contributed to improve the response
time. DTRA provided the major support for the integrated information system, through provision
of software, equipment and training.

Component 2: Human Health

8.      The implementation of this component was affected by the reforms in the health sector,
including large scale hospitals and laboratory system reform, and the staff turnover at the
MoLHSA, State Chancellery and implementing agency. Despite these constraints and the
ensuing delays, the component achieved good results, with the key technical assistance
assignments tendered, key trainings completed and certain equipment for lab as well as for the
hospitals processed, and procurement of seasonal flu vaccines carried out. Nonetheless, some of
the activities envisaged were not carried out (e.g. some laboratory equipment and the BSL3
laboratory).

A. Enhancing Public Health Program Planning and Coordination.

9.      In 2005 a National Influenza Preparedness Plan was prepared by the MoLHSA, but not
harmonized with other sectors, including animal health. Under the project a more comprehensive
document was prepared and approved by the Governmental Commission on Emergency
Situation Management. In addition, related trainings were provided: (i) for the hospital managers
(27 persons), (ii) for journalists, spokespersons and representatives from both ministries (33
persons in total). The desk simulation exercise for various stakeholders (32 persons) took place
and involved the Ministry of Defense, MoA, MoLHSA, NCDC, and other stakeholders. In
addition, two workshops were organized, in which the WHO and DTRA representatives
participated actively.

10.     Institutional Capacity Development. The project helped build the institutional capacities
to command and control in a coordinated manner the above mentioned contingency plan.
Moreover, the project provided training to both medical and non-medical personnel from Tbilisi
as well as from various regions of the country. Overall, the project succeeded to train 40 medical
and non-medical personnel on usage of artificial pulmonary ventilators from regional hospitals,
including Tbilisi and Kutaisi. Around 90 Ob&Gyn, 12 journalists, 17 physicians and engineers
from ICUs, and 610 PHC staff members received tailored trainings on pandemic influenza
(including swine flu) and communication methods. The project also supported (i) the
participation of a Georgian delegation to the 7th International Bird Influenza Summit organized
in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA (November 13-14, 2008) and to the 6th International Ministerial
Conference on Avian and Pandemic Influenza that took place in Egypt, (October 24-26, 2008);
(ii) a special study tour to Italy and France for the managerial level of the MoLHSA, MoA,
NCDC and project administration in 2008 (December 13-21, 2008). The study tour was aimed to
show the best available international practices in regards to the contingency planning,
surveillance, lab systems, etc. A delegation from Georgia also participated in the International
Swine Flu conference in August 19-23, 2009 in USA, for latest knowledge and best practices in
crisis management, vaccination strategies, using of antiviral medications, etc.; and also in the



                                               21
International Swine Flu conference in March 9-14, 2010 in London, UK. All trainings,
workshops, and conferences financed by the Project are documented.

B. Strengthening of National Public Health Surveillance Systems.

11.     B1. Improvement of Laboratory Network. Originally, the project considered upgrading
the existing laboratory, including design and renovation that is required for BSL 3 level with
concomitant physical containment requirements, required for virus isolation and sub-typing to
determine various strains. During project implementation, the option of purchasing a mobile BSL
3 was reconsidered and cancelled based on the following reasons: (i) the virus can be easily
detected in a BSL 2 laboratory using PCR equipment that already exists in the laboratories and
for the final confirmations the specimens should be sent to an UK reference laboratory; (ii) the
mobile labs are extremely expensive, including maintenance; (iii) the mobile labs are very
dangerous if not handled properly since they would be dealing with live virus; and (iv) DTRA
was building a BSL 3 laboratory that would eventually become available. It was then decided
that the funds for this activity would be used for additional needs to strengthen medical services.
The fund was used for procurement of seven ambulance cars distributed to four referral centers
throughout the country. The integrated laboratory network that includes the veterinary laboratory
chain has been handed over to the NCDC/MoLHSA 2 in 2008. Based on this decree on the
laboratory network integration, the Central Reference Laboratory (CRL) was exclusively
managed by the NCDC while the regional and district level network remained under the
respective ministries, i.e. MoA and MoLHSA. The project supported the CRL to develop its
strategy and management plan, as well as to develop certification and accreditation options for
the CRL as requested by the Government. In addition, a comprehensive list of laboratory
equipment needs for the CRL was developed along with the quality management requirements.
In 2010 the project initiated the procurement of laboratory equipment, however due to the very
limited number of the lab equipment suppliers and poor market the bid process on the specific
equipment for the NCDC /CRL could not be completed.

12.     B2. Development of Blood Strategy and five-year operational plan. In 2009 it was
decided to give project support for development of a blood strategy. Special technical assignment
on blood strategy development as well as operational plan for 2011-2015 was tendered out. This
assignment included the development of the corresponding training curriculum and provided
essential ToT trainings for respective personnel. A consultancy firm was recruited and the scope
of its assignment was increased twice – (i) with additional 5-day workshop for key personnel of
BTS centers, which was critical for the implementation of the proposed new BTS strategy and
the operational plan activities, and (ii) with the preparation of the guidelines and protocols for
clinical use of blood products. The contract for revision/development of clinical guidelines and

  According to the Governmental Decrees #36 (February 22, 2008) and #160 (July 30, 2008), the new integrated laboratory system has been
established in Georgia. This new system covers human health laboratories that are managed by the MoLHSA and animal health laboratories that
are supervised by the MoA. The Central Reference Laboratory (CRL) will provide services for both health and veterinary sectors and will be
supervised and managed by the NCDC/MoLHSA. Overall, system will be supervised by the special governmental coordination committee on
infection diseases detection, surveillance and response




                                                                   22
protocols on HPAI, ILI, and SARS was signed with local firm. The objective of the assignment
was to contribute to the improvement of the quality of health care services by
updating/developing the Treatment Guidelines and Protocols for (a) human influenza disease
(HPIA and other pandemic influenza); (b) influenza-like illnesses (ILI) nationwide; and (c)
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Georgia. The contractor presented two
deliverables. To harmonize the contract final deliverables with the MoLHSA requirements
specified in the new manual for preparation of guidelines in Georgia, the existed contract was
extended until the end of the project.

13.     B3. Improvement of Health Information System. The Bank supported the strengthening
of the information system mainly through the ongoing Health Care Sector Development Project,
along with other donors such as EU and DTRA. The project supported hot lines for both
veterinary and health sectors. This support included comprehensive technical assistance and
trainings as well as purchasing of equipment. In 2008 DTRA program delivered the
computerized system that is covering regional centers, while the project supported the rolling out
of the system to the lower levels, including district level centers. In addition, the project
purchased 70 computers for all district level public health centers, and additional IT equipment
(20 computers) to enhance the NCDC information system capacity.

C. Strengthening Health Systems Response Capacity.

14.     C1. Vaccination Support, Anti-viral Therapy, PPE. Purchasing of seasonal vaccines
started in 2007 and repeated each year since then. Overall, 14,000 doses of seasonal trivalent
vaccines were purchased and distributed to the first-contact high-risk persons, including medical
and non-medical personnel. Also, 105 kg of Tamiflu was purchased and stockpiled, out of which
56 kg was purchased by the project and the remaining was financed by the Health Sector
Development Project in 2005. In 2009, in order to enhance country preparedness, the project
supported the procurement of PPEs (Gloves: 512,000 pairs; Masks: 1,245,000 items; Mask #95:
5000 items), which was added to the stockpile initially delivered under the WB SRS project in
2006, and was used during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

15.    C2. Medical services.

Intensive Care Unit (ICU) equipment: Initially the project provided some supplies and equipment
for the ICU (45 units of artificial pulmonary ventilators and 50 units of monitors) in 2008, and
additional equipment (30 neonatal ventilators) was procured during 2009 – 2011. In order to
further improve the ICU capacities, additional 80 monitors, 60 baby incubators and 230 infusion
pumps were purchased by the project.

Ambulance cars: The procurement process for the intensive mobile units (ambulance cars) was
successfully completed, and seven ambulances were delivered and distributed to the Emergency
Center, Iashvili Pediatric Hospital, Gudushauri Medical Center, Republican Hospital and
Akhaltsikhe referral centre.

Technical Assistance for the Medical Waste Management: TA on medical waste management
was completed by Grontmij/CarlBro and ETLog Health EnviroTech & Logistics, Denmark and
Germany in 2009. Two large scale workshops were organized; 8 local ToTs were prepared from


                                               23
the MoLHSA and Ministry of Environment. The final version of the report was discussed on the
PIT meeting and submitted to the MoLHSA officially.

Technical Assistance on the Hospital Infection Control. This assignment was executed under
contract with the French consultancy firm, Conseil Sante, with the objective of developing the
health care associated infectious control policy and operational plan. Training of
infectionists/epidemiologists was also carried out under the project

Component 3: Public Awareness and Communication

16.     This component promoted awareness and helped improve coordination of the execution
of the overall GoG’s contingency plan. Under this component, support was provided for the
information and communication activities to increase the attention of the Government, private
sector, and civil society organizations, and to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding
among the general population about the risk and potential impact of the different zoonoses.
Support was primarily focused on the information and communication activities including
advocacy, public information and behavior-change interventions.

17.     Public awareness activities were carried out in collaboration with different other agencies
such as UNICEF and USAID. Most of the planned activities were taken up by other donors,
resulting in less than anticipated spending under this component. An AI Communication Strategy
and a Survey on Knowledge, Attitude and Practice on AI were prepared by UNICEF. Based on
these documents, information materials for different age groups (more than 600,000 copies), TV
and radio spots were developed by UNICEF. Also, the special guidelines and curriculum were
prepared for schools. Informational materials such as booklets, posters, leaflets targeted on
specific groups, including medical personnel were developed as well and distributed by various
organizations, such as USAID, Red Cross, WHO, Oxfam. Media training and training for the
spokespersons were covered by the USAID funding.

18.    At the very early stage of the project implementation, the project contributed to the
development and maintenance of the multilingual AI website (www.avianflu.ge); and the
preparation and distribution of the pre-outbreak information materials for households with
backyard poultry, farmers, poultry traders, veterinary services staff, small entrepreneurs (80,000
copies). These materials were distributed in six regions of the country that were identified as at
most risk of HPAI infection.

19.      The Communication Strategy and KAP Survey were used as a basis for subsequent
communication activities under the AIP. The project also supported more generic
communication topics that addressed AI prevention and control and at the same time included a
broader scope of zoonotic and general health concerns identified by the KAP survey and using
approaches recommended in strategy such as: (i) personal health and hygiene related to AI and
other zoonoses; (ii) food safety and food preparation practices including poultry and other foods;
(iii) seasonal flu vaccination and health; (iv) backyard livestock production including poultry; (v)
brucellosis; and (vi) rabies prevention and control - stray animals, vaccination, etc.




                                                24
20.     Under each PR campaign, activities included development of the key message, content,
scenario and design of TV and radio spots, design of flyers and notebooks for children, training
of personnel. About 123 teachers from various Tbilisi schools were trained on basic hygiene, and
journalists were trained on promoting influenza prevention and treatment measures.

21.     Overall six video and four audio clips were prepared, and designs for talk shows were
developed and broadcasted on four topics through main TV and audio channels. Core areas for
TV and audio communication were: (i) personal hygiene behavior, (b) influenza prevention and
treatment measures; (c) rabies prevention and treatment; (d) food safety behavior in Georgia.
Based on the materials prepared by the contractor, the project procured media time for
broadcasting of media/audio clips and talk shows.
Information materials for various groups of population were produced and distributed throughout
the life of the project. About 15,000 copies of “Calendar – 2010? for general population were
printed and distributed by the MoLHSA and MoA in 2009. More than 110 schools received
special design notebooks with basic hygiene communication messages. Dissemination of school
notebooks (15,000) and fliers (80,000) started at the World Day on Hand Washing. The PR
action took place on Hand Washing International day (October 15). To ensure the
implementation of PR campaign on Promoting Influenza Prevention and Treatment Measures,
5,000 copies of Y2011 calendar, 50,000 flyers for general population and 7,000 posters, 700
stickers for bus stations and 30 stickers for subway were produced and distributed.

22.    Booklets for small size and backyard poultry farmers (80,000 copies) were produced and
disseminated in six regions of Georgia; the same booklet was translated in Russian for ethnic
minorities and 20,000 copies were produced and disseminated. As per the request of the MoA,
20,000 information booklets for hunters were produced and disseminated. Shortly after, based on
the subsequent request from the MoA, 20,000 copies of brochures on “Advices on different
zoonotic diseases? (AI, anthrax, brucellosis, rabies, African swine fever, tuberculoses, etc.) for
poultry farmers were also produced and handed over to the MoA.

23.     Extensive trainings on how to communicate the key messages related to the pandemic
influenza for 90 gynecologists in Tbilisi and Kutaisi were completed in July, 2010. Special
training materials focusing on these issues were disseminated during the trainings.

24.    Behavioral impact campaigns were implemented through the following means: (a) rabies
prevention and treatment – 2,500 posters and 60,000 copies of information booklets; (b) food
safety behavior -- 60 000 copies of information booklets and 2 500 posters were printed for
general population by the end of the project.

                          Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A.     Introduction

1.      The analysis at appraisal followed the approach of estimating the economic costs due to
impact of avian influenza on the poultry sector. Notably, the effects of the avian influenza were
assumed to be the loss of value added in the poultry sector, the positive externalities in the red
meat sectors, capital losses in the poultry sector, as well as Government and private sector costs
associated with containment of outbreak and monitoring of poultry stock. Given that human
health effects were not well known at the time of project preparation, the analysis at appraisal did
not consider these effects.

2.    The current analysis employs a simpler model that is based on the assumption that the
key impact of the pandemic influenza is going to be the reduction of poultry stock due to
mandatory culling and transmission of the disease to humans with possible effects of mortality
and morbidity.

3.      As such, the economic evaluation of the impact of the project calculates the cost of
pandemic influenza that has not yet happened with a moderate scenario in the base case and
iteration of several expected scenarios. The calculations assume that the project activities on
pandemic preparedness and prevention will have resulted in: (a) a reduction of infection rates in
poultry; (b) a reduction of risk of transmission of infection from poultry to humans as
represented by the reduction of the infection in humans; and (c) a reduction in mortality in
humans.

4.      It is important to note that the impact of poultry outbreaks includes direct costs (value of
destroyed/deceased poultry, disease control costs, consequential on-farm losses), substitution
effects (price effects, red meat etc.), and indirect costs (reduction in tourism, transport freight,
trade, etc.). However, this exercise does not attempt to estimate the above mentioned costs per
se, and the assumption in the analysis is that the costs such as disease control costs are embedded
in the annual operation costs. The analysis at appraisal indicated that the disease control and
monitoring costs were negligible at the time of the project preparation. Our observation
throughout this exercise is that the annual operational costs are going to increase because of the
project, since there is amplified attention by Georgian authorities on control of infectious
diseases.

5.     With regards to indirect costs, such as price effects and tourism effects, the calculation of
impact of these is beyond the objectives of this exercise. Though we acknowledge that such costs
may have considerable impact on the economy, however, for the purpose of this exercise the
estimation of these costs would have been a costly attempt.

B.     Project Costs

6.     Project costs totaled US$8.94million, comprising US$.6.9 million from IDA and IDA-
administered Trust Funds and US$2.04 million equivalent from the Government. Annual
incremental recurrent operation and management costs are assumed at 10% of the project



                                                26
    investment costs, which in turn were about 60% of total project expenditures in the human and
    animal health sectors. The exchange rate used was US$1 = GEL1.7. Conversion factors on
    project costs were not used in this analysis.

    C.       Project Benefits

    7.      The analysis considers that the project activities on pandemic preparedness and
    prevention will have resulted in: (a) a reduction of infection rates in poultry; (b) a reduction of
    risk of transmission of infection from poultry to humans as represented by the reduction of the
    infection in humans; and (c) a reduction in mortality in humans.

    8.      The benefits of the project, therefore, are considered in the form of human and economic
    losses averted through the activities of the project. Its estimated benefits are the cost of human
    hospitalizations averted, the income losses avoided due to reduced rates of infection,
    hospitalization and deaths, and the production losses of poultry meat and eggs averted. Other
    benefits, such as the much improved capacity to detect and respond to other zoonoses and
    infectious diseases, or the reduction in scale and cost of poultry culling and possible
    compensation measures due to better surveillance and control are not considered. Secondary
    effects, such as the prevention of abrupt and severe changes in poultry prices on farm incomes or
    consumer incomes and of cross-price elasticity effects on other livestock subsectors were also
    ignored.

    9.      It is assumed, for the base-case scenario, that a severe HPAI outbreak with a mutated
    virulent virus would occur every five years, with the first one in 2011, at the project completion.
    The time period for the benefits stream being considered is 2011-2025. A discount rate of 12%
    per annum and an exchange rate of GEL 1.7/US$ were used.



                                                    27
a.    Human Health Benefits

10.     The project’s objective with regards to human health is to “prepare for, control, and
respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans?. The
project’s main impact on human health thereby is expected to be the decrease in the percentage
of the human population infected by HPAI, thereby decreasing the number of hospitalizations
required and decreasing the number of deaths attributable to HPAI. The benefits are therefore
expressed in terms of loss avoidance and include:

     (i)   the economic value of hospitalization costs averted: GEL1,782 for an average stay of
           11 days per hospitalized person 3;
     (ii) the economic value of income loss avoidance from days lost due to illness: it is
           assumed 25% of the affected population would lose 3 days of take-home income and
           50% of the hospitalized survivors would lose 30 days of income, at a daily wage of
           GEL 28; 4
     (iii) income loss avoidance from fatal HPAI cases: average take-home income of GEL
           557/month over 15 years for all HPAI deaths prevented. 5

11.    For the base case, the incidence if HPAI infection among the human population (Gross
Attack Rate) was estimated at 5%, with 10% of those affected requiring hospitalization and 3%
of those affected dying from the disease (the Without-Project scenario). 6 The With-Project
scenario estimates are that only 2% of the population would be affected by HPAI infection, with
10% of the affected being hospitalized and a death rate of only 1.5% among those affected.

b. Poultry Sector Benefits

12.     According to GeoStat, there were close to 6.6 million poultry in Georgia in 2011, mostly
chickens, but also some ducks, geese and turkeys. About 75% of these birds are kept by medium
and small farms and or in household backyards. It is in these two segments of the poultry that
the risk of HPAI outbreaks is highest, since biosecurity at the large commercial poultry farms is
considered to be quite good for the purposes of this analysis.




3 This information was extracted from background reports prepared as part of the Government completion report for the Human health
component.
4 The other 50% are assumed to be children and retirement-age adults.
5 The number of persons in this group is assumed to decline by 2% annually, reflecting normal mortality rates.
6 We are taking a more conservative numbers here. Similar World Bank projects used, at appraisal, Gross Attack Rates as high as 30%.

13.     The project’s animal health objectives are “to minimize the threat posed to humans and
the poultry industry in Georgia by HPAI and other zoonoses in domestic poultry?. Thereby the
project’s main impact on the poultry industry is expected to be the decrease in the number of
poultry infected by HPAI and, thus, the number of poultry deaths caused by HPAI. Economic
project benefits arise therefore in terms of loss avoidance. They include:

     (i)   the economic value of poultry meat production loss avoided: the number of broiler
           poultry deaths averted at the average live chicken farm-gate price of GEL5 per live
           chicken, and average weight of 2 kg, and assuming that 50% of the birds killed are
           broilers to be used for meat;
     (ii) the economic value of egg production losses avoided: an average of 150 eggs per layer
           per year at a farm-gate price of GEL0.285 per egg, assuming that 50% of poultry deaths
           are layer hens; and
     (iii) the meat value of the layer hens at the end of their productive lives: assumed to be 75%
           the value of a broiler.

14.     For the base scenario, the poultry population affected by an outbreak (Gross Attack Rate)
of HPAI was estimated at 5% of the small farm and backyard poultry population -- a “low
infection rate? scenario -- with a 100% mortality rate of the birds affected by HPAI (the Without-

Project scenario) 7. In addition, an equal number of birds, in and around the locations where
HPAI outbreaks are confirmed, was assumed to be destroyed through culling as a precautionary
virus control measure.

15.     The With-Project scenario assumes that only 2% of the small farm and household poultry
would be affected by HPAI and would die, and that an equal number would be destroyed by the
eradication program. The project can only affect the number of poultry that become infected and
that need to be culled, but it has no effect of decreasing the mortality rate among the poultry
flocks infected. As in the case of the human health sector, the actual numbers of poultry affected
by an HPAI outbreak are difficult to estimate since there is little empirical information and a
divergence of opinions within the veterinary profession.

16.    In the analysis, poultry production in the absence of an HPAI outbreak is assumed to
grow at a 2% annual rate.

D.       Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis

17.    The base scenario analysis relates the project costs (Table 3.1) to the benefits from the
economic value stream of losses avoided as a result of project activities in human health and in
the poultry industry, expressed as the expected value of the economic loss avoided from an
outbreak occurrence once in five years during the period from 2011 to 2025. It is expected that
the benefits from the project expenditures on laboratories, equipment, patient care facilities,
public awareness programs and increased human capital will continue to accrue over this entire
15-year period. The project investment costs were incurred from 2006 to 2011.

18.     The market prices used for poultry and poultry products are considered to be economic
prices, because the markets operate freely with no production quota system and no subsidies for
poultry or poultry inputs. Wages and other market prices used in the analysis are also assumed to
be economic prices.

19.     Table 3.3 presents the results of the economic analysis based on the above base case
assumptions and parameters for the combination of both human health and poultry sector losses
avoided. The results for the base scenario are quite robust, with a 50 % ERR, a benefit-cost ratio
of 2.54 and a NPV of US$ 22.9 million.

  Please note that this is a very conservative assumption. Gross attack rate could be as high as 30%. The reduction of
the poultry stock due to 2006 outbreak was around 28%. However, taking a 5% Gross Attack Rate with an
assumption of that equal number of birds are culled in the vicinity of outbreaks is a realistic assumption.

20.     The human health benefits substantially outweigh those in the poultry production sector.
The two parameters that drive the economic value of the human health benefits are (i) the project
impact on the percentage of the human population affected by HPAI infection, and (ii) the
project effectiveness in reducing the expected mortality rate from HPAI infection. The effects of
changes made in these parameters can be significant, as depicted in Table 3.3. However, the
returns are sensitive to parameter changes, when they change to indicate relatively small
improvements in the percentage of the human population affected by HPAI and in the number of
human deaths attributable to HPAI. For example, Scenario 4 with small differences in impacts
rates of the project on the percentage of the human population affected and the number of human
deaths while renders an ERR of 28% and a NPV of US$.6.98 million, but a Benefit/Cost ratio of
0.77.

21.    Changes in the key parameters for the poultry industry have also impact on the overall
outcomes, and yield the benefit cost ratio of below 1. As the key parameters get closer the
impacts of the project become less economically justified. The key reason for this could be the
slow disbursements over the project period, and overall slow implementation of the project.

22.     The timing of likely HPAI outbreaks has a significant influence on the results of the
analysis, since benefits begin to flow at different times and/or at lesser frequency. Estimates were
therefore made also for scenarios with a new HPAI outbreak only once in three years and only
once in every seven years, with the first one occurring in 2011. As shown in Scenarios 25
through 27, a reduced frequency of HPAI outbreaks considerably reduces the aggregate benefit
stream. By the same token, more frequent outbreaks raise the economic value of project benefits,
as Scenarios 13 through 18 illustrate.

23.     Finally, there is the question of ascribing all human health benefits simply to the AIPP,
when there were two parallel projects, including the SRS and the Primary Health Care
Development Projects under implementation in Georgia at the time, along with a substantial
HPAI preparedness support programs by USAID, WHO, UNICEF and by the Government’s own
budget. The total of these investments is estimated at around US$ 2.3 million. It may thus be
argued that the project cannot claim the total economic value steam of losses avoided, especially
in human health. Scenarios 7 through 12, 19 through 24 and 28 through 30 reflect the
assumption that only half of the human health benefits are attributable to the project. The returns
in this case are sensitive to most coefficients and yield only higher benefit ratios for those
scenarios that have higher differences in with and without project coefficients. 8




8
    Separate rates of returns for human health benefits and for benefits to the poultry industry are not presented,
    because AIPP project activities are an integrated package which would not be undertaken separately.




                                                         32
E. Conclusion

24.     Project benefits are primarily driven by key assumptions regarding the gross attack rate
for the human population and for the mortality rate among those affected as well as by the likely
frequency of HPAI outbreaks. This is to be expected in a project that is intended to prepare for a
contingency for which neither timing nor severity can be reliably predicted.

          Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.       At the start of the project development indicators were determined as: (i) evidence of an
effective and inter-sectoral surveillance system in place for both animals and humans for HPAI
and other zoonoses; (ii) evidence of institutional mechanisms in place for effective
implementation of an integrated and multi-sectoral contingency plan for endemic preparedness
and; iii) contained outbreaks in poultry with no demonstrated transmission from birds to humans.

2.      It can be stated that surveillance system was well set up at different levels through
Georgia and response mechanism could adequately deal with both natural disaster such as
pandemic in 2009, but emergency preparedness also had a positive spin-off such as in 2008
during the invasion of Russia in Georgia. All institutional mechanisms are now in place to
implement well elaborated contingency plan, following by appropriate training and provision of
equipment. Although during (limited) outbreak in birds in 2006, no human transmission had
taken place, the established system of surveillance, emergency response and communication can
be assumed to be in position to deal adequately with any future outbreak of birds of animal
linked pandemic.

3.      The project was effective but less efficient than it could be. Being de facto an emergency
project, where timeliness and effectiveness matters more than efficiency this is definitely a very
good achievement.

Performance of the Borrower

4.      Following the design of the project, most of project implementation had to be done by
procurement, either of goods or services. As reports and interviews show, the procurement
processes were plagued by delays and retendering. While first 2 years of the project some goods
were procured, many planned activities via hiring services were seriously delayed. Sometimes
the terms were offered that were not matching interest or capacity of providers, other time
allocated contract time was miscalculated and had to be extended. Procurement was further
hampered by complex procedures and sometimes unrealistic demands that were not matching
limited number and capacities of local providers of medical equipment. Permanently ongoing
reforms in both Ministry of Agriculture and MoLHSA and subsequent staffing changes, also
within the project, also led in some cases to delay decisions on procurement.

5.       The overall management and coordination of the project were quite well arranged with
the structure set up at the start of the project. Overall responsibility and ultimate decision
concerning pandemic preparedness and response was in hands of GSCAIG. IMTF coordinated
work among involved Ministries and met regularly, overseeing operational work of Project
implementation team (PIT). The team, despite of frequent changes of composition because of
ongoing changes in the Ministries had both the mandate and the committed core more permanent
staff that allowed to make operational decisions and changes as the needs appeared. Finally
actual implementing staff (such as NCDC, Emergency Response Team of MoLHSA, health care
facilities and laboratories staff) were well trained and equipped to respond timely to the
pandemic threat. That has proved invaluable in time of pandemic in 2009 leading to adequate
response.



                                               38
Performance of World Bank

6.      Local representatives of the World Bank and visiting monitoring team properly
understood the design of the project that aimed more at emergency preparedness and response
rather than a development project. It is reflected in their understanding and flexibility during
implementation. Some no more justified activities were dropped, such as equipment of level 3
Bio laboratory, while other were added, usually on request of MoLHSA such as additional
research and training of safe blood supply, medical waste management and nosocomial
infections, all having link to possible epidemics in Georgia. Their ongoing monitoring, technical
assistance and patience greatly contributed to a positive outcome of the project. Nevertheless, the
rules and regulations of the World Bank directly connected to implementation of the project were
consequently enforced. They were at times helpful, at times seen as unduly strict and
cumbersome, especially as borrower was also obliged to follow its own rules. As the project in
the practice was heavily depending on outsourcing of both goods and services, requirements and
their complexity coupled with limited local technical capacities were sometimes reason of delays
in implementation.

           Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments from UNICEF

1.      The World Bank-supported project on AI was a good and timely continuation of earlier
efforts of the Government of Georgia, UNICEF and other partners to fight AI and to strengthen
country’s preparedness. There was a very good coordination between UNICEF and the World
Bank to ensure that there was no duplication of efforts and all the interventions were
complimentary and needs driven. UNICEF-supported KAP study and Communication strategy
were used as a baseline for the Bank’s project communication activities.

2.      As the KAP survey conducted by UNICEF identified a lack of knowledge on hygiene
norms among children and communities, the World Bank project communication focused on
raising awareness on hygiene practices which was highly recommended and aimed to fill the
gaps in this regard. It was also very critical to develop pre-tested and tailored messages to each
target group. It is important to note that all the interventions were based on the strategy and we
can consider the whole campaign as well planned and implemented.

3.     It is extremely important to conduct another KAP and evaluation of the campaign to
measure the progress and to learn what has been achieved. So, the plans in this regard are highly
appreciated. It is critical to learn what is the knowledge of the population at risk on AI and that
of the public in general on hygiene practices. This will create a solid base for any further
campaigns/interventions and will become an important roadmap to identify the gaps and actions
needed.

4.      We do think that it is still crucial to further promote the improvement of hygiene
practices at family and community level and to focus more on schools - including surveillance,
monitoring and hygiene promotion.

Comments from EU

Report format/structure

5.     It would be good and helpful to have an executive summary of the report. Some
summarizing tables are provided at the beginning, but this cannot substitute the need of an
executive summary.

Report content/accomplishments

6.     Most of indicators used are input not output oriented. In addition, it is difficult to measure
them. For instance, “information system installed? is not an indicator of improvement, but a
statement of an activity that has been developed.

7.     In assessing the achievements of this project it would be also useful to take into
consideration the other projects and activities performed in the very same filed parallel to it. For
some achievements like “Food Agency established?- in the establishment of the National Food

Agency, apart from this project, there was a large scale EU advocacy in the broader context of
EU policy dialogue with the Government. The same can be said regarding strengthening of its
capacity, which was done via various EU-assisted projects (ex. GEPLAC, many TAIEX, other
TA project under different EU instruments). The same can apply to the achievement related to
the veterinarian legislation. According to the report “draft legislation developed? is s one of the
“actual values achieved at completion of the project?. Again, the fact that Georgia has now better
vet legislation is something broader that the only this project impact. The EU efforts in this
direction via policy dialogue and other EU TA projects were crucial.
