REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY FOR
THE SOUTH ANTALYA TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$26 million to help fi-
nance the foreign exchange cost of the South Antalya Tourism Project. The
loan would have a term of 25 years, including 6 years of grace, with interest
at 8.85 percent per annum. US$2.6 million wouLd be relent to Kepez A.S., a
private power company, at 11 percent per annum, with a repayment period of
10 years, including 3 years of grace; and US$1.8 million to Post, Telegraph
and Telephone (PTT) on the same terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        An economic updating mission visited Turkey in November 1974 and
its report (No. 71la-TU) entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Turkey" dated June 9, 1975, was circulated to ithe Executive Directors on June
17, 1975. The economic situation of Turkey was reviewed anew by a Bank mission
in April 1976; its findings are being analyzed. A country data sheet is at-
tached as Annex I.
3.        Despite an uncertain domestic political situation resulting in fre-
quent changes of Government since 1971 and, more recently, the international
recession, Turkey has maintained an impressive rate of economic growth. GNP
grew rapidly in the last decade, averaging an impressive 7 percent annual
growth in real terms in the period 1962-72.  Industry, power, transport and
construction were the sectors contributing most to this growth rate. Due
largely to a decrease in agricultural production reflecting poor weather con-
ditions, the growth rate dropped to 5.5 percent in 1973, but reccvered to 7.4
percent in 1974, and reached an estimated 7.9 percent in 1975, ccmpared to the
Third Plan (1973-77) target of an average of 7.9 percent per annum. Despite
some difficult problems that the economy faces, this relatively high growth
rate underlines the basic vitality of the Turkish economy. The main issues
facing the Government, which require the establishment of priorities as well
as of corrective measures, are: (a) high rate of inflation; (b) insufficient
mobilization of public resources; (c) employment generation problems; (d) deter-
ioration in the balance of payments; and (e) inadequate coordination among
Government agencies in project implementation (discussed in para 13 below).
4.        The budgetary situation in the last decade was dominated by the
relatively rapid growth of public expenditures. Although tax revenues also
grew rapidly, the increase was more than offset by the rise in Gcivernment
1/   This section is the same as that contained in the President's
Report (P-1847-TU) for the Third Livestock Development Project,
dated May 12, 1976.

expenditures and transfers. As a result, the overall budget deficit widened
and the Treasury borrowed increasingly from the Central Bank. In 1972 and
1973, the Treasury introduced a stricter control of current expenditures and
succeeded to some degree in shifting the sources of finance for the budget
deficit from the CentraL Bank to the sale of Government bonds to the public.
However, partly due to a shortfall in tax revenues and partly due to increased
current expenditures resulting from inflation and the Cyprus operations, the
budget deficit rose again in 1974 to TL 7.3 billion (compared to TL 5.4 bil-
lion in 1973). Central Bank financing of the Treasury rose by TL 4 billion
and became a major factor in monetary expansion at a time when stricter mone-
tary controls were needed. The deficit in 1975 was originally estimated at
TL 9 billion, but will more likely be significantly larger.
5.        Over the years, the State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) have general-
ly earned low profits, necessitating an increase in budgetary transfers from
public resources to meet their operating and investment needs. A significant
portion of the SEEs' deficits are accounted for by the Turkish Railways and
the Coal Corporation. Other SEEs have shown either small profits or small
losses. During 1974, the prices of several SEE products were raised sub-
stantially (ranging from 20% to 167%) to improve their respective financial
situations. In addition, railway tariffs were increased by an average 56 per-
cent in 1975. The savings performance of the SEEs showed some improvement in
1973 and 1974, and they were able to finance an increased proportion of their
investment from their own resources. However, because of delays in implement-
ation resulting from poor managerial and limited technical capabilities, and
because of difficulties in the procurement of imported materials, gains are
still below Third Plan targets. Consequently, many SEEs continue to rely on
substantial budgetary transfers. The reform of the SEEs--in organization,
management, executive and labor skills and pricing policies--remains crucial,
especially if Turkish industry is to be prepared for competition from the EEC.
Realistically, these basic reforms can only be initiated by a strong and
stable Government which commands significant and coherent parliamentary
support.
6.        The rate of domestic inflation has been high in recent years.  The
average rate of increase in wholesale prices rose from about 20 percent per
annum in 1973 to nearly 30 percent in 1974. Inflationary pressures have been
partly fueled by growth in domestic liquidity, which averaged about 25 percent
per year during 1970-74. Other contributing factors include increases in
agricultural support prices for domestic and export products as well as in
minimum wages, and substantial increases in import prices. Measures to re-
duce the growth of domestic liquidity, without discouraging investment and
growth, are essential to ease inflationary pressures. The trend towards
rapid increases in Central Bank financing of the public sector needs to be
reexamined. In late 1974, the Government raised interest rates to encourage
private savings and long-term lending. The interest rate on medium-term
credit was raised from 12 to 14 percent and rates on time deposits up to one
year from 4 to 6 percent. The present Government of Prime Minister Demirel
regards the restoration of domestic price stability as one of the key prob-
lems on which Government policy must be focused. There has in fact been a



significant reduction in the rate of inflation in the last year. The whole-
sale price index rose by only 11.0 percent in 1975 compared to 30 percent in
1974; and the Government estimates an average rate of inflation (as measured
by their GNP deflator) of only around 16 percent in 1975, compared to 27 per-
cent in 1974.
7.        Turkey's development strategy places greater emphasis on growth
of output through higher labor productivity than on increased employment. As
a result, the labor surplus, including that in agriculture, rose from an esti-
mated 1 million in 1962 to 1.6 million in 1973, representing about 10 percent
of the labor force. Until 1973, emigration, especially to Germany, partially
eased the pressure on employment. Between 1965 and 1973, net emigration
totaled about 450,000. The economic slowdown in Europe has, however, con-
siderably reduced labor emigration from Turkey from 136,000 in 1973 to only
20,000 in 1974 and 5,000 in 1975. Nevertheless the Third Plan continues to
emphasize investment in capital-intensive industries, and estimates the
non-agricultural labor surplus to grow to 300,000 by 1977. With prospects of
further emigration of Turkish labor to Europe reduced, at least in the medium-
term, unemployment should be a major concern of economic policy. A pilot land
reform program is currently underway in Urfa province in the southeast where
most of the larger farms are located; expropriation of land was started in
November 1974. Speedy implementation of rural development programs would also
help to slow migration and ease unemployment in rural and urban areas. In
addition, labor intensive production methods need to be emphasized, where
appropriate, in the formulation of projects. liowever, even with these measures,
and faster growth than planned in construction and services, unemployment is
likely to remain a significant problem.
8.        The Third Plan constitutes the first phase of Turkey's long-term
strategy for the period 1973-95. The ultimate objective is to raise stand-
ards of living in 1995 to those of Italy in 1970 through rapid industraliza-
tion and decreasing dependence on external resources. The Plan aims at an-
nual growth rates of 8 percent in GDP, 12.7 percent in fixed inve!stment, a
marginal national savings ratio of 38 percent (compared with about 18 per-
cent in the Second Plan), an annual increase in commodity imports and exports
of 9.4 percent and 7.1 percent respectively, wlhich, taken together with pro-
jected growth in invisible earnings (mainly workers' remittances), is ex-
pected to result in a decline in gross inflows of official external assis-
tance.
9.        Prospects for continued high economic growth remain good, although
in view of the shortfall of the first two years of the Third Plan, achieve-
ment of the 7.9 percent average rate of annual growth during the Plan period
seem unlikely. The Plan's projections also seem to be overly optimistic on
prospects of an increased savings level and balanced external accounts with
reduced levels of external assistance. Experience during the last two years
suggests that present efforts to mobilize greater domestic savings to sup-
port a rapid growth of investment, especially in the public sector, need
to be greatly intensified. The Plan anticipates that two-thirds of the
increase in national savings will come from the public sector, through in-
creases both in surpluses of the SEEs and in tax revenue. Given the past



performance of SEEs and delays in implementing a general reform, (see para-
graph 5 above), the expected rapid growth in their surpluses is not likely
to be realized. Given the present domestic political outlook, it will also
be most difficult to raise tax revenues to the extent envisaged by the Plan.
There is nevertheless scope for increases if appropriate policies are pursued
more vigorously, e.g. improving tax administration, widening tax coverage to
include agricultural incomes and service incomes, increasing the rate of
property taxation, and introducing a value added tax. Domestic resource
mobilization in the public sector is, in any case, likely to continue to be
a significant constraint in the growth of public investment. Besides improved
financial performance from the SEEs, increased borrowing abroad as well as
increased long-term borrowing from the domestic private sector will be neces-
sary to achieve the ambitious public sector investment targets. As Turkey's
development program requires funds in excess of savings that can be mobilized
domestically, and these cannot be provided in adequate amounts if foreign
finance is limited to foreign exchange cost of high-priority projects,
some local cost financing by foreign lenders will be required.
10.       The balance of payments projections of the Plan have not taken into
account recent developments on the international scene. The sharp increase
in the price of petroleum and other imports during 1974, and the prospects of
further increases in import prices in the next several years, indicate that
foreign exchange needs for financing imports will be much higher than projected.
Commodity imports and exports in 1973 were already above the level projected
for 1977. Workers' remittances in 1972 were higher than the 1977 target and
continued to grow until recently. However, they decreased by 8.0 percent in
1975 as compared to 1974, and their future is uncertain, due to the temporary
restriction on further entry of foreign workers into the major labor-importing
countries of Europe. On the other hand, recent agreements between Turkey and
Libya to send Turkish workers to Libya, and the possibility of similar arrange-
ments with other oil-producing countries, should help alleviate the situation.
II.       After substantial surpluses in 1972 and 1973, Turkey's overall bal-
ance of payments experienced a deficit in 1974, with net reserves declining
by about $360 million. This was due partly to a sharp increase in the trade
deficit and a slowdown in the growth of workers' remittances, as well as to a
reduction in official capital aid inflows. The large trade deficit resulted
mainly from an 80 percent increase in the import bill (in particular, petro-
leum, wheat, iron and steel), due mainly to higher prices. Imports continued
to rise at a rather rapid rate in 1975, and totaled about $4.7 billion during
the year. On the other hand, export earnings, which totaled about $1.4 bil-
lion in 1975, registered a decline because of the recession in major importing
countries, agricultural supply constraints, restrictions on exports to relieve
domestic shortages, relatively inflexible export pricing policies, diversion
of some goods to Cyprus, and deteriorating terms of trade. As a result, gross
reserves declined to about $1.8 billion at the end of 1974, and further to
about S1.0 billion at end of December 1975 (the equivalent of about 2.7 months
of imports at the present rate). In the medium-term, Turkey's balance of
payments is likely to come under significant pressure. Such pressure could,
however, be partly eased, by lifting quantitative restrictions in certain



exports, e.g. cement and olive oil, designed to accommodate domestic supply.
The Government should also avoid fixing commodity prices at levels above
those prevailing in international markets. Even more important are deliberate
measures to contain the growth of imports. Without such measures, and in the
absence of a resurgence of growth in Europe, Turkey faces the prospect of
continued, perhaps intensified, pressures on its balance of payments and its
reserves. In May 1974, the Turkish lira was revalued vis-a-vis the dollar from
TL 14.00 per US$ to TL 13.50 per US$, without a change in parity with other
currencies. In September 1974, the exchange rate per US$ was readjusted to TL
13.85, and in April 1975, it was restored to the previous parity of TL 14.00.
As a result of subsequent small devaluations, the rate per US$ stood at TL
16.00 as of April 2, 1976.
12.       At the end of 1974, total external debt outstanding anc disbursed
was estimated at $3.1 billion, of which all but 3 percent was public or pub-
licly guaranteed. The share of the Bank Group was about 11 percent of total
debt outstanding and about 8 percent of total debt service in 1974. The
average terms of new credits made available to Turkey have been hardening
in recent years, and this trend is expected to continue. Debt service as
a ratio of exports of goods and non-factor services plus workers' remittances
was about 6.5 percent in 1974, compared to 12 percent in 1971. Despite
the deterioration in the balance of payments in 1975, the debt service ratio
is expected to remain within acceptable limits in the medium term, if proper
policies are pursued. In view of the decline in foreign reserves and anti-
cipated pressures on its balance of payments in the medium term, Turkey
should continue to exercise considerable care in its external debt manage-
ment, and its resort to suppliers' credit financing should be also kept within
closely monitored limits. Meanwhile, Turkey continues to be crecditworthy for
Bank financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
13.       The 1970 economic stabilization program and devaluation of the
Turkish lira, which improved the balance of payments, enabled Bank Group
lending, which had previously been intermittent, to be established on a
continuing basis at a high level. As of June 14, 1976, and inclusive of the
$56 million TEK II loan signed on that date, the Bank Group has lent $1,295.2
million to Turkey through 46 lending operations (or 41 projects, since both
loans and credits were provided for some projects).  Fourteen of these opera-
tions have been in agriculture and rural development (including multipurpose),
sixteen in industry (including DFCs), ten in power and the rest in urban
development, transportation, and education.  Agriculture and rural develop-
ment account for 26 percent of the funds lent, industry and DFCs for about 38
percent and power for about 26 percent.  Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of May 31, 1976 respectively,
with notes on the execution of ongoing projects. Implementation of projects
has been satisfactory in the private sector, but less so in the public sector
where significant delays have resulted from pclitical uncertainty, limited
coordination among agencies, staffing problems and related administrative



- 6 -
delays. Disbursements have consequently been slower than expected. To im-
prove this situation, the Government has recently established a ministerial
coordinating committee, supported by a new secretariat located in the Ministry
of Finance, which is responsible for coordinating all aspects of Bank Group
operations. In connection with this new framework, the Government and the
Bank initiated in June 1975, joint quarterly reviews to identify and resolve
key bottlenecks impeding satisfactory project implementation. The results so
far have been encouraging, considering that these reviews were only recently
initiated, and the rate of commitments and disbursements in the last few
months has begun to improve.
14.       The serious issue besetting the Elbistan power project (Loan No.
TU-1023) has been resolved. As a condition of effectiveness of the loan,
the Government had undertaken to raise electricity tariffs by about 30 percent
to enable the power authority (TEK) to earn the 8 percent rate of return
prescribed by the TEK law and set forth in the loan agreement with the Bank.
Because of serious inflationary pressures faced in 1974-75 and in recognition
of the Government's anti-inflationary policies, agreement was subsequently
reached on a tariff increase that would enable TEK to earn 6 percent in 1976.
An appropriate increase, which the Government estimates will enable TEK to
earn a 6 percent return in 1976, was recently decreed by the Government. The
Bank has therefore made this loan effective as of June 1, 1976. This will
also enable Turkey to utilize loans provided by EIB amd KfW for this project.
15.       Bank lending to Turkey is mainly directed at supporting Turkish ef-
forts to improve: (a) lagging public sector saving, through gradual improve-
ment in the SEEs; (b) better income distribution and improvement in the level
of living standards, through rural development efforts, better urban planning
and increased employment and incomes; and (c) long-term capacity to earn fo-
reign exchange, through promotion of industrial and agroindustrial exports
and tourism. While the Bank continues to support gradual institutional and
structural changes in the sectors in which lending is provided, continued
substantial external financial assistance is equally important, in view of
the increase in projected capital import requirements and the pressures on
the balance of payments and overall fiscal resources, mentioned in paragraphs
9-11 above.
16.       In support of these objectives, it is proposed to continue to devote
the Bank's development efforts to certain key sectors, of which agriculture is
the most important. In this sector, emphasis is being put on rural develop-
ment, the strengthening of agricultural credit mechanisms, and livestock, as
for example the Agricultural Credit and Agroindustries Project (loan 1248-TU),
and the Third Livestock Development project (loan 1265-TU), both signed in
May 1976. Industry (including mining and DFCs) and power, where the gradual
strengthening of the SEEs is the key task, will also receive significant sup-
port. This program is supplemented by projects such as the proposed tourism
project and future ones in selected sectors including urban development and



transport. Until recently, Bank lending was ailso focused in two geographical
areas: (i) the Istanbul region, with emphasis on urban planning, water
supply, power distribution and industrial finance; and (ii) the Cukurova
region around Adana on the southern coast, with emphasis on power, irrigation,
and fruit and vegetable production. Lately the focus has been gradually
broadened, especially to include the Anatolian plateau and eastern Turkey in
support of efforts to widen the geographical base of development, develop
rainfed agriculture, improve the distribution of income, and discourage rapid
urban migration and encourage tourism development.  The latter will be sup-
ported through the proposed project. Other projects under preparation and
being processed towards appraisal include wastewater disposal in Istanbul, a
hydroelectric project, a second DFC operation with the State Investment Bank
(DYB), and a second railways project.
17.       IFC has invested in the production cf nylon yarns, pulp and paper,
glass, aluminum steel pipes and tourism. As of May 31, 1976, gross commit-
ments totaled $142.97 million, of which $75.72 million were stilL held by IFC.
IFC is currently investigating investment opportunities in the industrial
sector, including textiles, synthetic fibers and inorganic chemicals.
PART III - THE TOURISM SECTOR
18.       Turkey stands out in the Mediterranean as a country which offers
an impressive array of tourism resources: a vast coastline with unspoiled
beaches and a pleasant climate, mountain scenery, and the archeo:Logical
remains of some of the oldest civilizations of the world. Further, Turkey is
within three to four hours flying time from northern and central Europe and,
unlike other developing countries, is easily accessible by car and train.
Despite such striking advantages, tourism was not given a significant role
in Turkish development strategy until the last few years.
19.       Despite the lack of a major tourism development effort, Turkey's
inherent attractions resulted in a steady and rapid increase in foreign
tourist arrivals in the 1960's and early 70's. However, the absolute numbers
of arrivals still remain below those of most other Mediterranean countries,
and well below Turkey's potential. During the period 1963-73, the number of
foreign tourists increased from 155,000 to 776,000. Following the energy
crisis, the economic recession in Europe and the Cyprus war, arrivals dropped
to 662,000 in 1974. However, between 1968 and 1974, the annual rate of in-
crease was 14.1 percent. The number of excursionists (i.e., foreigners
visiting the country for less than 24 hours) jumped from 44,000 in 1963 to
562,000 in 1973, and tapered off to 370,000 in 1974. In recent years approxi-
mately 60 percent of the tourists have come from France, United IKingdom,
Germany, Italy and the USA. The average length of stay of foreign tourists
was seven days for 1973-74. In the last 10 years, foreign tourist traffic
has followed a seasonal pattern, with the summer months accounting for about
57 percent of total annual arrivals.



20.       Tourism in Turkey is, however, not limited to foreigners.  Because
of Turkey's large population and rising living standards, domestic tourism
is significant. The Ministry of Tourism and Information (MTI) estimates that
domestic tourism has increased at the rate of about 10 percent annually be-
tween 1965 and 1974, and in 1974, accounted for nearly 3 million hotel visits.
21.     The country's hDtel capacity has, however, not kept up with the grow-
ing number of tourist arrivals and constitutes a bottleneck to future tourism
expansion. In June 1975, there were 42,733 beds in registered tourism es-
tablishments. The annual rate of increase of these accommodations averaged
about 8.5 percent in the 1963-1975 period. In 1975, there was also an addi-
tional 214,000 beds in unregistered establishments. The majority of Turkey's
accommodations are privately owned and are concentrated in the country's
largest cities. The Government owns and operates 13 hotels and holiday vil-
lages, comprising 12 percent of total registered capacity. Many of the exist-
ing luxury and class A hotels and vacation villages are owned by nationals,
but managed by foreign operators under contract. Room occupancy patterns vary
according to location. In major cities, occupancy rates are high throughout
the year, averaging about 75 percent. In contrast, Antalya follows the
seasonal pattern of other Mediterranean beach resorts, with a June-to-September
rate of 80-90 percent, and an annual average of 45 percent.
22.       The gross foreign exchange receipts from tourists represented 13
percent of the country's total foreign exchange earnings from the export of
goods and non-factor services in 1974. In the season, about 38,000 Turks
are directly employed in the hotel industry. Another 40,000 jobs in res-
taurants, shops, tour agencies, handicrafts, transport and agriculture are
indirectly dependent on the hotel industry.
23.       Since the early 1960's, the Government has financed much needed in-
vestment to support tourism in a number of functional areas and geographic
locations. Nevertheless, tourism infrastructure, especially outside the main
cities, as well as tralning school capacity for hotel personnel, remain as key
bottlenecks to further private investment in hotels and related superstruc-
ture, which is urgently7 needed to enable Turkey to benefit from the great
tourism potential it possesses. Between 1962 and 1975, the Government in-
vested nearly $180 mil:Lion in the tourism sector. These expenditures com-
prised investments in infrastructure (45 percent), hotels (30 percent), tour-
ism promotion and hote:L training schools (12 percent) and archeological resto-
ration activities (13 percent). Various incentives are also available to stim-
ulate private investment in the sector: (i) long-term loans at preferential
terms (8 percent interest rate, 15-year maturity, three-year grace period)
through the Tourism Bank (TBI); (ii) favorable selling and leasing terms for
hotel or resort development sites; (iii) tax relief, including partial rebate
of corporate taxes, and five years' exemption from real estate taxes; (iv)
exemption from custom luties on imported materials and equipment required for
hotel construction. These incentives are in line with those offered in other
'lediterranean countries. However, the administration of the incentive package



- 9 -
is cumbersome and it is not clear to what extent a different "mix" of incen-
tives would improve resource allocation in the sector. In the circumstances,
the Government has agreed, as part of the proposed project, to undertake a
study of the incentives program and its possible need of modification (draft
Loan Agreement, Section 3.11).
24.       The Ministry of Reconstruction and Resettlement (MRR) and MTI are
cooperating in preparing and implementing the physical plans for tourism
development. Within the tourism sector, MTI is responsible for defining
development objectives, establishing policies, preparing regional plans for
development, publicizing abroad the country's tourist attractions and over-
seeing the operations of the Tourism Bank (TBI). TBI, established under
corporate law in 1960 as a State Economic Enterprise (SEE), has twD main
responsibilities:  (a) providing credit for tourism investments, particularly
for hotel development; and (b) participating directly in hotel construction,
leasing and management. Between 1971 and 1974, TBI lent US$18 million to help
finance 109 projects in the tourism sector. With 770 rooms in hotels and
vacation villages under its management, TBI is now also one of the biggest
hotel operating companies in Turkey.
25.       MTI and the Ministry of National Education (MNE), share jointly the
responsibility for hotel training. MTI operates four vocational training
centers, located in Ankara, Antalya, Istanbul, and Izmir, and a fifth in Urgup
in historic Cappadocia southeast of Ankara, is planned for 1976. Since 1967,
these centers have trained about 2,200 students in basic trade skills required
in the tourism sector. The MNE has three high schools which provide three-
year training programs in hotel middle management, located in Ankara, Istanbul,
and Kusadasi on the Aegean coast. A fourth school, to be located in Antalya,
is planned for 1976. These high schools have produced about 2,000 graduates
since the program was established in 1964.
26.       To help Turkey increase foreign exchange earnings and also benefit
from the significant employment stimulated by the tourism industry, recent
governments have accorded high priority to the development of the tourism
sector. The Third Five-year Development Plan (1973-77) envisages a total
investment in the tourism sector of $300 million ($80 million more than the
figure in the previous plan). Planned development of priority regions for
mass tourism is stressed. About a third of the planned investments will be
spent on infrastructure, and the balance on hotels and tourism related facil-
ities. While the private sector is expected to continue to play a major
role in the development of accommodations, direct government participation
is envisaged to supplement private initiative, should the latter prove inade-
quate. According to the Development Plan, the number of foreign tourists
(including excursionists) in Turkey is expected to increase by 13 percent a
year and gross tourist receipts by 20 percent by 1977. These estimates are in
line with the long-term projections of Mediterranean tourism markets, which
anticipate that Turkey will double its market share by 1985 and that 52,000
additional beds will be needed by 1980. Given l'urkey's vast tourist potential
and the Government's new commitment to develop it, these targets sesem realis-
tic and merit support and encouragement.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
27.       In 1969, the Government established as a priority "Tourism Develop-
ment Region", the entire coastal strip (three kilometers wide) from the
Dardanelles near the northern end of the Aegean Sea to Antalya near the middle
of Turkey's Mediterranean shore. In 1971, the MTI began preparing tourism
development plans for three major coastal sub-regions in this belt: the North
Aegean, the South Aegean (Mugla), and the Mediterranean (Antalya). In 1973,
the Government and a Bank mission selected the proposed project area south
of Antalya, as the most promising of a number of alternative locations for a
possible tourism infrastructure project in Turkey. A feasibility study
was subsequently prepared by MTI's Planning Department, with the assistance
of consultants financed under a UNDP project, with the Bank as executing
agent. The project was appraised in November 1975. Negotiations were held
in Washington between May 27 and June 4, 1976. The Turkish Delegation was led
by Mr. Muammer Akinci, Chief Economic and Financial Counselor of the Turkish
Embassy, and included Mr. Ozkan, Deputy Undersecretary of MTI.
Project Setting and Area
28.       The proposed project, which is the first Bank-financed tourism
project in Turkey, is also Turkey's first integrated planned effort in the
tourism sector. Its objective is to assist Turkey in developing South Antalya
into a major tourism resort aimed primarily at the European mass market.
29.       The proposed project is situated on the Antalya Bay, about 50 kms
south of the city of Antalya, which is the small but rapidly growing center of
an important truck gardening and fruit growing region. Infrastructure for
tourism development will be provided in four selected priority sites located
along about 15 kms of the coastline at: Kiziltepe, Tekerlektepe, Guneydeniz
and Kemer (see map). This area is endowed with great natural beauty, excellent
beaches, heavily wooded foothills and a typical Mediterranean climate. The
extensive ruins of the ancient colony of Phaselis, established by the Kingdom
of Rhodes in the 7th Century BC, are located nearby. Several other major
archeological sites are located within daytime excursion distance. Antalya
airport is being expanded to accommodate large jets. Under the proposed loan,
the Government has undertaken to open this airport to regular international
and foreign charter flights, which would supplement air connections provided
by the Turkish carrier THY (draft Loan Agreement Section 4.05(b)). The old
port of Antalya regularly receives cruise ships, and a new harbor west of the
city serves cargo ships.
30.       The project area is at present predominantly rural, with a total
population of only 3,100. It has no water distribution, sewerage or power
supply systems; the only infrastructure is a small telephone exchange in
Kemer. A new highway is being constructed between Antalya, the project area
and Finike farther south, to replace the present low-quality road serving the
area. A 350-room Valtur Holiday Village (in which IFC holds an equity parti-
cipation) is the only existing tourist accommodation facility of any signifi-
cance in the project area.

Project Description and Features
31.       The proposed project is designed to provide the tourism infra-
structure needed to support 2,250 additional rooms in hotels and vacation
villages which are expected to be built by private investors in thle project
area by the completion date of the project in 1981, and a cumulati.ve total of
5,750 additional rooms by 1990. The infrastructure to be provided includes
both the essential supporting facilities and a variety of recreation-related
investments.
32.       The specific components of the proposed project are as follows:  (i)
completion of the Beldibi-Tekirova section (32 kms) of the new Ant:alya-Finike
highway and construction of access roads to the four project sites; (ii)
installation of streets, electricity, water, sewerage, drainage, health,
recreational and community facilities in Kemer to transform this village into
a service center for the project area; (iii) construction in Kemer of a small
craft harbor and a commercial/social center and provision of two 4.0-passenger
ferry/excursion boats; (iv) installation of improved telecommunication facili-
ties consisting of a 300-channel microwave link between Antalya and Kemer, a
new telephone exchange at Kemer, upgrading of the existing telephone exchange
of Antalya and provision of a 45-km telephone network and 40 telex machines to
be leased to hotels in the project area; (v) construction of a water supply
and sewerage and solid waste disposal system for the project area; (vi) con-
struction of a 154 kv power line from the Kepez power station, a new trans-
former substation at Kemer, 31.5 kv lines from there to all project sites, and
a stand-by power supply system; (vii) construction and equipping of a hotel
training center in Kemer with a dormitory for 250 student places, a practice
hotel with a capacity of about 50 rooms and a potential annual output of 375
graduates; (viii) construction of 280 housing unlits in Kemer to hcuse 30
percent of hotel employees expected to work in the project area by 1981; (ix)
works to protect and provide easy access to the Phaselis ruins; (x) develop-
ment of day use beach facilities for 2,500 visitors, three camp sites for 900
tents, and trails and other recreation facilities in the existing national
park in the project area; (xi) provision of teclnical assistance for project
administration, small craft harbor management, public utilities operation,
promotion of tourism in the area and an economic study on hotel profitability
and tourism incentives as well as a conservation study and underwater archae-
logical survey of Phaselis. A Loan and Project Summary is provided in Annex
III. A report entitled "Appraisal of the South Antalya Tourism Infrastructure
Project (TU 1051)" dated June 21, 1976, is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors.
33.       At the regional level, the basis for physical planning of the pro-
posed project is the 1:25000 scale South Antalya Tourism Master Plan, approved
by MRR in April. The detailed land-use regulations related to this Master
Plan and the detailed master plan (scale of 1/5000) for the village of Kemer
are being finalized; their adoption and issuance by the Government together
with satisfactory building regulations, is a condition of loan effectiveness
(draft Loan Agreement Sections 6.01(c) and (g)). These plans will help ensure
the rational development of tourism in the project area, with optimal use of
available land including provision for large undisturbed open spaces and
environmental protection, at the, lowest possible infrastructure costs.

Land Acquisition
34.       Most of the land required for tourism development up to 1981 under
the proposed project is already owned by the Government. However, 25 ha
needed in the Tekerlektepe and Kiziltepe sites, remain in private hands.
Acquisition of these lands is planned in two stages. First, the Government
has informed the owners that they would have an adequate opportunity to decide
either to develop their lands themselves, or in association with others, in
conformity with the tourism development plans for the project, or to sell or
lease their lands to private hotel developers. Second, the Government has
agreed that as a condition of effectiveness it would initiate expropriation
procedures through the appropriate agency (the Land Office of the MRR) for
any portion of the 25 ha for which such arrangements have not been concluded
(draft Loan Agreement Section 6.01(e)), and acquisition would be completed
before November 1, 1978 (draft Loan Agreement Section 3.07(b)). This two-stage
approach is designed to give present owners the opportunity to participate in
the project, if they wish, while also providing assurance that those lands
needed prior to 1981 for hotel development under the project will become
available for that purpose on an acceptable schedule at non-speculative
prices. In addition, 5 ha of privately owned land within Kemer, is required
for pensions and guest houses and 20 ha of privately owned land in the other
sites is needed for hotel development after 1981. 1/ For these lands, the
Government similarly will notify the owners in advance and give them the
option either to develop their land themselves, in conformity with the tourism
development plans, or to sell or lease it to private developers by a date to
be announced, after which acquisition procedures would be initiated (draft
Loan Agreement 3.07(c) and (e)). The Borrower's Land Office is also expected
to exercise its preemptive rights in the project area whenever it feels that
this is reasonable under the circumstances and notification of the Land
Registry of the Project Area by the Borrower through the Land Office of its
intention to exercise these rights is a condition of effectiveness (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 601(f)).
35.       The project would be completed in 1981, providing infrastructure
for continued hotel investment thereafter through 1990. Hotel investor in-
terest in South Antalya seems strong. Prospective investors, predominantly
Turkish (80 percent), have already submitted specific proposals for the
construction of 3,600 rooms during the early stages of the project. But the
risk remains that satisfactory hotel investment proposals might not be forth-
coming from private investors for the number of rooms planned to be supported
by the proposed infrastructure. To ensure hotel development in the project
area sufficient to obtain an acceptable rate of return on infrastructure
outlays, the Government has agreed to take all necessary action to ensure
that a minimum of 3,825 rooms would be in operation by end of 1989, provided
1/ Under Turkish law, land expropriated for a specific use must be put to
that use within five years or it reverts to its original owner. According-
ly, expropriation procedures for land to be used for the project after 1981
would be scheduled no more than five years in advance of prospective use.



- 13 -
the Government and the Bank are satisfied that there is adequate tourist
demand for such facilities in the project area at such time (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 3.10). As mentioned in Part III above, the Government
provides several incentives to private investors for hotel investments.
Hotel credit requirements in the project area are estimated to peak at a
total of about $60 million equivalent in 1979. The Government has provided
assurances that it would arrange to provide financing on terms suitable for
long-term hotel financing, to complement funds iErom other normal channels,
including TBI, should they fall short of requirements.
Project Costs and Financing Arrangements
36.       The estimated total cost of the project, excluding interest and
other charges during construction on the Bank loan, is $66 million, of which
$22 million or 33 percent is in foreign exchange. The proposed loan would
finance the foreign exchange component, as well as $4 million in respect of
interest and other charges, during construction up to April 1980, by which
time most of the project construction is expected to have taken place. Local
costs would be financed by the Government from budgetary resources. The Gov-
ernment would make US$17.6 million of the proceeds of the loan available to
MTI for the implementation of all project components except electric power and
telecommunications. The electricity component would be executed by KEPEZ A.S.,
a private power company and the sole concessionaire in the project area,
to whom the Government would onlend the equivalent of US$2.6 million at an
interest rate of 11 percent per annum, with a repayment period of 10 years,
including 3 years of grace. The telecommunications component would be
executed by PTT, a State Economic Enterprise to whom the Government would
onlend the equivalent of US$1.8 million on the same terms as to Kepez. The
signing of two subsidiary loan agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, between
the Government and Kepez A.S. and between the Government and PTT, would be a
condition of loan effectiveness (draft Loan Agreement Section 6.01(a)).
Retroactive financing totalling $300,000 is proposed to cover the foreign
exchange cost of the final project design (from December 1, 1975) and of
construction of the main highway to the project area (from March 1, 1976)
(draft Loan Agreement Schedule I paragraph 4(i)).
Project Implementation and Operation
37.       The overall responsibility for implementing the project will rest
with the MTI, which has created a Regional Tourism Project Execution
Directorate (PRD) to serve as project unit. Appointment of a Project Director,
with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank, has been made
a condition of effectiveness (draft Loan Agreement, Section 601(h)). MTI,
through PRD, will supervise project execution and enter into agreements with
the ministries and agencies responsible for the final design and execution of
specific components. The Ministry of Public Works will build the highway and
the small harbor. The PTT will install and operate the telecommunications
facilities. The Ministry of Forestry will be responsible for development and
maintenance of the National Park. The Ministry of Culture will be responsible
for protection and access works at Phaselis. Kepez A.S., as noted, will
construct and operate the power facilities.



- 14 -
38.       PRD will be directly responsible for the execution of the following
components: (i) water supply, sewerage and solid waste disposal facilities;
(ii) Kemer infrastructure and urban improvement; (iii) employee housing; and
(iv) the Hotel Training School, which, after construction, will be managed
by the Vocational Training Department of MTI. TBI, which as noted above in
paragraph 24 has experience in superstructure construction and management,
will assist PRD in executing the above-mentioned facilities. PRD will also
be responsible for prormoting hotel development in the project area, coordi-
nating the selling or 'Leasing of land to private investors for that purpose,
and operating and maintaining the housing component and the small harbor. In
addition PRD will operate and maintain the water, sewerage, and other municipal
services until such time as the village of Kemer might be established as a
municipality, when it would normally take over these functions.
39.       Coordination among the executing agencies will be provided at the
working level by two committees established specifically for this project
(draft Loan Agreement Section 3.03), and their establishment has been made
a condition of effectiveness (draft Loan Agreement, Section 601(b). The
first, the South Antalva Tourism Project Coordinating Committee, would be
chaired by the Deputy UIndersecretary of the MTI and have responsibility for
coordination in Ankara,, The second, the South Antalya Tourism Project Coor-
dinating Subcommittee, under the chairmanship of the Governor of Antalya,
would coordinate project implementation at the regional level. The national
policy level Tourism Coordinating Committee, chaired by the Minister of
Tourism and attended by the under-secretaries of state of all ministries
involved in tourism, would continue to provide general policy guidance within
the tourism sector.
Procurement
40.       Equipment will be procured under international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's guidelines except for equipment which costs less
than the equivalent of US$100,000 or which cannot be combined into contracts
of at least that amount, for which local competitive bidding will take place.
A 15 percent preference margin, or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is
less, will be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids for
equipment. With the exception of road construction, and other minor civil
works (together not expected to exceed $4 million) which would be on force
account, major civil works would be awarded under international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Project items would be grouped
to the extent possible in order to encourage such competitive bidding. Local
competitive bidding would be used for civil works contracts of less than
US$500,000. The total amount of such contracts is estimated not to exceed
US$2.0 million. To attract both local and foreign bids, contracts will be
broken down into elements which can be tendered individually or combined into
bidding groups at the bidders' option.
Disbursements
41.       The proposed loan, which is expected to be fully disbursed by the
end of 1981, would finance:  (i) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost



- 15 -
of imported equipment and material or 100 percent of the ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured equipment procured under international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines or 80 percent of imported
items procured locally; (ii) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of
consultant services; (iii) 30 percent (representing the estimated foreign
exchange component) of the cost of civil works; and (iv) interest and other
charges during construction on the proposed loan up to April, 1980. During
the final design stage, the Borrower will satisfy the Bank that the proposed
stand-by power supply system is technically and economically justified before
disbursements estimated at $1.25 million are made on this component (Loan
Agreement I, paragraph 9 (iii).
Benefits and Risks
42.       The proposed project is designed to provide basic infrastructure
for a major development of tourism facilities in South Antalya. In estimating
the gross benefits that are likely to accrue from the tourism-related activi-
ties of the proposed project, only the expenditures which visitors are expected
to incur in the area have been taken into account. The relevant costs include
the capital and operating costs of the infrastructure to be provided under the
project together with the capital and operating costs of hotels and related
facilities in the project area. On this basis, and assuming an estimated
economic life of the project of 25 years, the economic rate of return on the
overall investments program (including superstructure) would be 17 percent.
This rate of return would decline to 15.8, if investment costs increased by
10 percent; and to 15 percent if the opening of hotels was delayed by three
years.
43.       The proposed project would have a favorable impact on Turkey's bal-
ance of payments. Incremental annual foreign exchange earnings are expected
to amount to US$17.7 millions in 1983 and to rise gradually to US$29.3 million
per year by 1993.  The project will also have a positive effect onl employment.
During implementation there will be a sizeable number of construction workers
(an average of 1,500) employed in the project area. When fully operational,
the project is expected to generate employment for more than 7,000 workers in
hotels and other tourism facilities. Indirect employment generated in con-
struction, agriculture, handicrafts, transportation and other services is
likely to account for 6,000 additional jobs.
44.       Arrangements have been made to minimize the risks associated with
the project. As already discussed, these include arrangements to (i) ensure
that lands needed for hotel development under the project become available
on an acceptable schedule while avoiding undue price speculation (see para-
graph 34 above), (ii) provide for sufficient hotel development investment
to ensure an adequate rate of return on the project (see paragraph 35 above),
and (iii) provide for proper project administration and coordination between
agencies concerned with project execution (see paragraphs 37 and 39 above).

1971. Effective Date: December 23, 1971. Closing Date: December- 31, 1976.
Project funds are now fully committed, and 152 subborrowers will
benefit under the Credit. This falls short of the 250-300 estimated at
appraisal due mainly to price increases. Imported cattle have peri-ormed up
to or in excess of appraisal estimates. Overall, the project has been suc-
cessful in establishing a valuable nucleus of over 3,500 high-qual:ity dairy
animals in Turkey, setting up demonstration farms, building infrastructure,
and in promoting dairy modernization through provision of credit and support-
ing technical services to dairymen.
Ln. No. 748 Education Project: US$13.5 million loan of June 9, 1971. Effec-
tive Date:  September 29, 1971.  Closing Date:  September 30, 1976.
The project is about two years behind schedule, due to the initial
reluctance of the Ministry of Education to provide the project unit: with ade-
quate qualified staff and authority commensurate with responsibilii:ies, that
this unit had to undertake. However, these problems have been resolved
and implementation is now proceeding well, including procurement of equipment
(the major component of the project). Although more limited progresss has been
made in achieving the overall educational objectives of the projecit, these are
now receiving increased attention, including progress in expanding local ad-
visory committees, curriculum development and training of teachers for project
schools. Similarly, interim actions have been taken regarding operation and
staffing of the Management Training Institute, pending passage of Legislation
formally establishing the Institute.  About $5.0 million has been disbursed
since the beginning of FY76 and disbursements are expected to continue at a
high level.

Ln. and Cr. Nos. 762/257 Fruit and Vegetable Export Project: US$10 million
Loan and US$15 million Credit of June 22, 1971. Effective Date: May 19, 1972.
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
The project was initially delayed by difficulties in making the
loan/credit effective by the due date. Progress with 3 of the 5 major proj-
ect components is satisfactory (refrigerated trucks, ferry boats, marketing
facilities). Of 2 ferry boats proposed for purchase, the financing of one
will be provided under Ln No. 1248 Agricultural Credit and Agroindustries
Project. A new extension approach has been initiated to increase the citrus
production, the fourth component. The fifth, the agricultural credit survey,
did not produce meaningful results, and other arrangements were made to pre-
pare an agricultural credit project for Bank financing. To permit loan funds
to be fully utilized, the closing date is being extended to June 30, 1977.
Ln. No. 763 TEK Power Transmission Project: US$24 million loan of June 22,
1971. Effective Date: October 4, 1971. Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
The implementation pace of this project has been slower than origi-
nally anticipated due to staff shortages experienced in the initial years.
First contracts were awarded early in 1972 and work is now progressing accord-
ing to the revised schedule. Problems in meeting the financial covenants
are maintained in connection with the Elbistan loan. Withdrawal applications
sufficient to cover remaining funds have been received and are being processed.
Cr. No. 281 Irrigation Rehabilitation Project: US$18 million credit of
January 25, 1972. Effective Date: April 27, 1972. Closing Date: June 30,
1977.
Project construction schedules were revised in 1973 and reviewed
in 1975, with the new completion dates for Silifke, Koprucay and Tokat sub-
projects being about two years behind the original schedule. Progress on con-
struction of irrigation and drainage channels and on-farm works at Silifke
and Tokat is now proceeding well, but on-farm works are still behind schedule
at Koprucay because of the extremely short annual work season. The training
program has been developed and is in the process of being implemented. After
considerable discussions with the Bank, action has also been recently ini-
tiated to locate and appoint individual experts required under the project.
Ln. No. 817 Steel Mill Expansion Project: US$76 million loan of April 28,
1972. Effective Date: August 4, 1972. Closing Date: December 31,1977.
The project is over a year and a half behind schedule, due to de-
lays in beginning procurement, stemming largely from inefficient management.
Following continuing discussions between the Government, the company and the
Bank on these problems, a well qualified senior executive was appointed as
the president of the company, a new project manager has been appointed and
management problems have essentially been overcome. The company is however
experiencing difficulties in finding adequate financing for the substantial
cost overruns for the project. However, Erdemir's cash shortfall for 1975



ANNELX II
Page 5 of 8
has been covered and the Government is actively exploring ways to cover the
expected 1976 shortfall, including steps to find a long term solution to
this problem.
Ln. No. 844 Istanbul Water Supply Project: US$37 million loan of June 30,
1972.  Effective Date:  January 4, 1973.  Closing Date:  June 30, 1977.
The supply of water for Istanbul has increased by 69 percent since
1971, and water supply to the Asian side has doubled in the past year, but
shortages persist, particularly for municipalities adjacent to Istanbul.
Project progress is about one year behind appraisal estimates, but reasonable
progress is now being made.  Draft reports of the management consultants were
completed in fall 1975 and their recommendations are now to be studied by
ISI's management.
Cr. No. 324 Istanbul Urban Development Project: US$2.3 million credit of
June 30, 1972. Effective Date: January 4, 1973. Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Four consultant groups started work between November 1973 and
February 1974. Work on the Wastewater and the Bus/Traffic Engineering and
Control Projects is nearing completion. Phase I of the Urban and Transport
studies are completed, and are presently under review by the Government and
Bank prior to finalizing plans for carrying out Phase II.
Ln. No. 845 IGSAS (Istanbul Fertilizer Company) Project: US$42 million loan
of June 30, 1972 as amended April 18, 1975. Effective Date: October 6, 1972.
Closing Date: October 31, 1977.
The project is expected to be completed by December 1976, represent-
ing a 3-4 month delay compared to the original schedule. The estimated cost
to complete shows an increase from $130 million to $147.3 million of which
$2.8 million is in foreign exchange. The cost overrun will be covered by the
Government, the State Investment Bank and the shareholders.
Cr. No. 330 Second Livestock Project: US$16 million Credit of September 28,
1972. Effective Date: January 5, 1973. Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The Village Livestock Development (VSD) subproject of the project
is behind schedule, due mainly to difficulties encountered heretofore in
recruiting both local and expatriate specialist staff because of the low
salaries and side benefits offered by the executing agency, the Directorate of
Livestock Development Projects (LDP) of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture
(MFA). However, as a result of the increased use of incentive payments and an
intensified recruitment effort in late 1975 and early 1976, the local technical
staffing of this subproject has now been increased to 40 professionals and
subprofessionals out of a current overall requirement of about 45. One of
three posts for individual experts is vacant, although a potential candidate
has been selected, subject to review by the Bank. As a result of the slow
staff build-up in the past, the VSD subproject has thus far proceeded slowly.



ANINEX II
Page 6 of 8
Less than 200 subloan,s of the 5,430 envisaged at appraisal are operational.
Partly due to credit eligibility requirements, servicing of larger farmers
(or groups), and increased costs, the average size of the 200 VSD sub-
loans approved is higher than anticipated, and represent a commitment level
of 30% of the funds available for VSD. As a result of the recent recruit-
ments, and additional staff being recruited, a substantial acceleration
of VSD sub-lending is anticipated this year. Virtually all of the funds for
subloans under the Livestock Fattening subproject (FSD) are committed, and
this subproject is proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 873 TSKB (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey): US$40 million
loan of December 28, 1972. Effective Date: March 21, 1973. Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Since the first Bank loan was made in 1950, a satisfactory rela-
tionship has been developed with TSKB whose standard of performance is con-
sistently high. This loan to TSKB has been almost fully committed.
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 883/360, Ceyhan Aslantas Multipurpose Project: US$44
million loan and US$30 million credit of March 22, 1973.  Effective Date:
March 20, 1974. Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
After initial delays due to difficulties in engaging a suitable
engineering consulting firm, good progress is now being made. Contracts for
on-farm development equipment and for main dam construction have been awarded.
The dam contractor was expected to start work by the end of November 1975.
Although Topraksu and the Ministry of Agriculture have not yet employed ex-
perts for on-farm development and extension, agreement has been reached with
the Government on steps to resolve this issue and employ the experts as quick-
ly as possible. In view of a substantial increase in project costs, a re-
vised financing plan is now under preparation by the Ministry of Finance; how-
ever, the Government has indicated that it intends to fully cover increased
project costs.
Ln. No. 892 Istanbul Power Distribution Project: US$14.0 million loan of
May 25, 1973. Effective Date: September 28, 1973. Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Progress on this project has been delayed by about three years by
lack of aggressive aclministration and costs have increased by nearly 130 per-
cent over appraisal estimates. Consultant studies of the Istanbul power mar-
ket and proposed company reorganization have been completed and the consultant
to study the gas supply system has now been appointed. The Government is
preparing proposals on how it will cover the increased project costs and
revitalize the company's finances.

Ln. No. 893 Turkish State Railways: US$47 million loan of May 25, 1973.
Effective Date: August 28, 1973. Closing Date: September 30, 1976.
After initial delays, procurement of track material and other Bank-
financed items is now progressing satisfactorily. TCDD's locomotive produc-
tion, which is being financed by another external lending institution, and
the pace of track renewal have both been acce:Lerated. However, the project
remains about a year behind schedule. Although tariffs have been raised
twice since the loan was made, other provisions of the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements have not been carried out as scheduled, but agreement has been
reached with the Bank about revising some of the original targets which TCDD
should achieve.
Ln. No. 957 Antalya Forestry Project: US$40 million loan of January 28,
1974. Effective Date: May 26, 1976. Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
A President's Memorandum covering the needed changes in the agree-
ments arising from a site relocation was circulated to the Executive Directors
on April 27, 1976 and subsequently approved. The loan was declared effective
on May 26, 1976, following finalization of the amendments with the Government.
Construction has begun at the new site and the project is expected to be com-
pleted by the end of 1978, about 2 years behind the original schedule. The
cost overruns are being met by the Government and the State Investment Bank.
Ln. No. 1023 Elbistan Lignite Mine and Power Project: US$148 million loan
of June 28, 1974. Effective Date: June 1, 1976. Closing Date: July 30, 1982.
This loan to the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) and the Turkish
Coal Authority (TKI) is to help finance the development of an opencast lignite
mine in east central Turkey and the construction of an adjacent lignite-burning
1200 megawatt power station and associated transmission lines. The loan was
declared effective on June 1, 1976, following implementation of arrangements
for the establishment of new electricity tariffs agreed upon bet:ween the
Government and the Bank. The effectiveness of the Bank loan will also permit
disbursements to begin under the EIB and KfW loans, who co-financed the proj-
ect with the Bank. Engineering and contracting are proceeding, with some
delays.
Ln. No. 1024 DYB (State Investment Bank of Turkey): US$40 million loan of
June 28, 1974. Effective Date: September 30, 1974. Closing Date: Decem-
ber 31, 1978.
Submission of subprojects has been slower than anticipated. How-
ever, seven projects totaling about $28.1 million have been approved and
disbursements have increased more rapidly in the first half of 1976.

Ln. No. 1078 TSKB (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey): US$65 million
loan of January 22, 1974. Effective Date: April 24, 1975. Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
The loan brings Bank lending to TSKB to $233 million. Since the
loan was made effective in April 1975, TSKB has taken significant steps to
mobilize additional domestic and foreign resources and is channelling the bulk
of its lending to Turkey's underdeveloped regions. As of May 31, 1976, about
$50 million of the loan had been committed.
Ln. No. 1130 Corum-Cankiri Rural Development: US$75 million loan of June 23,
1975; Effective Date: January 2, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The loan was declared effective following establishment of the
project extension service and after the appointment of a project director
and two deputies. Recruitment of extension staff and some construction work
have commenced.
Ln. No. 1194 Second TEK Power Transmission Project:  US$56 million loan of
June 14, 1976. Effect:ive Date: September 14, 1976. Closing Date: December

Ln. No. 1265 Livestock III: US$21.5 million loan of May 26, 1976.
Effective Date: Sep:ember 27, 1976. Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Technical Assistance Project - Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK): US$1.9
million grant of August 20, 1967.
Technical assistance contracts covering the second phase of the
work were terminated in November-December 1972. Achievement, though short
of target in some respects, is generally satisfactory and TEK now has a much
improved accounting, budgeting and financial reporting system. Contracts for
the last phase of the work have been signed and final training program has
gotten underway, with one group of accountants having already completed train-
ing and further training groups being planned.

Procurement         With the exception of road construction and other minor
Arrangements:      civil works (together not to exceed US$4.0 million) which
would be on force account, major civil works and equipment
contracts would be awarded under international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Project items
would be grouped to the extent possible in order to encour-
age such competitive bidding. Local competitive bidding
would be used for civil works contracts up to US$500,000
and equipment contracts up to US$100,000. The total
amount of such contracts is estimated not to exceed US$2.5
million. In order to attract both local and foreign bids,
contracts would be broken down into elements which would be
tendered individually or combined into bidding groups at
the bidders' option. In evaluating international bids
for equipment contracts, domestic manufacturers would be
allowed a preferential margin of 15 percent of the CIF
price of competing imports or the prevailing level of
customs duties, whichever is lower.
