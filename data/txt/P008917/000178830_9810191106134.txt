SOUTH ANTALYA TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.          This report appraises a project which would provide infrastructure
and resort facilities for tourism development south of Antalya on the Mediter-
ranean coast of Turkey. The infrastructure would consist of roads, water
supply, sewerage, solid waste disposal, electricity and telecommunications.
The resort facilities would include a small craft harbor, camping and public
beach facilities. These works, conceived within the framework of a comprehen-
sive regional master plan, would support the development of 5,750 hotel and
vacation village rooms to be built by private investors by 1990 in the four
resort sites of Kiziltepe, Tekerlektepe, Kemer and Guneydeniz (2,250 of these
rooms will be built by 1981). The project would also include all works needed
to turn the village of Kemer into a service center for the project area, housing
for hotel employees, hotel training facilities, national park facilities and
the preservation of the Phaselis archaeological site.
ii.         Although a number of modern hotels have been constructed and tourist
arrivals have increased by 14% per year from 155,000 in 1963 to 662,000 in 1974,
Turkey's impressive tourism assets are still largely untapped, particularly on
the southern coast where the pleasant climate, attractive beaches, scenery and
historical sites provide an ideal environment for tourism development.
iii.        The project is estimated to cost about US$66 million.  The proposed
loan of US$26 million would cover the foreign exchange component of the pro-
ject (US$22 million) and interest during construction (US$4 million). The
balance of the funds required to finance the project and cost overruns would
be provided by the Government.
iv.         With the exception of road construction and certain minor civil
works which would be on force account, major civil works and equipment contracts
would be awarded under international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank guidelines. Project items would be grouped to the extent possible in
order to encourage such competitive bidding. Local competitive bidding would
be used for civil works contracts up to US$500,000 and equipment contracts
up to US$100,000. The total amount of such contracts is estimated not to
exceed US$2.5 million. In order to attract both local and foreign bids,
contracts would be broken down into elements which would be tendered indi-
vidually or combined into bidding groups at the bidders' option. In evaluating
international bids for equipment contracts, domestic manufacturers would be
allowed a preferential margin of 15% of the CIF price of competing imports
or the prevailing level of customs duties, whichever is lower.



- ii -
v.         The Ministry of Tourism and Information would create a special
department, the Project Directorate (PRD) with overall responsibility for
carrying out the project.  PRD would construct and operate several components
and would supervise those carried out by specialized Government agencies, such
as the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of Forestry. The Tourism
Coordinating Committee (TCC), chaired by the Minister of Tourism and Informa-
tion, would assure the political coordination of the project, and two sub-
committees (one in Ankara, one in Kemer) would assure the working level
coordination of the project.
vi.        The project would be the first integrated tourism development in
Turkey aimed at the European mass market. Investor interest in South Antalya
is strong and the sheduled investment in 5,750 rooms appears reasonable.
Based on the build up of hotel facilities, about 160,000 visitors would be
expected by 1990, 80% of them foreign. This would represent about 4% of pro-
jected arrivals in Turkey and is considered a feasible market target.
vii.       The economic rate of return is estimated at 17.2%.  Visitor
expenditures would result in incremental net foreign exchange earnings of
US$17.7 million in 1983, rising to US$29.3 million per year from 1993. The
regional impact of the project would be considerable. When fully operational,
it would create 7,000 jobs in hotels and other facilities and an additional
6,000 in construction, handicrafts, and other services. It would ensure the
orderly urban development of Kemer and other settlements in the area under
strict building and zoning regulations.
viii.      The project is suitable for a Bank loan to the Turkish Government
of US$26 million equivalent, for a term of 25 years including a grace period
of 6 years.

SOUTH ANTALYA TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01        In 1973, Turkish Government officials and a Bank mission selected
a 15 km coastal strip south of Antalya for a first tourism infrastructure
project. The tourism potential of this coast had already been investigated
within the framework of a comprehensive master plan prepared by the Ministry
of Tourism and Information for the whole Antalya region. A feasibility study
for the project was carried out by a Government team assisted by four experts
provided by UNDP with the Bank as executing agency. The project was proposed
for Bank financing in September 1975.
1.02        In November 1975, the project was appraised by a mission composed
of Messrs. van Gent, Calkins, Christie, Flores, Krippl and Jakubecki (consult-
ant). Messrs. Cuellar and Page (consultant) assisted in the evaluation of
the public utilities component.
1.03        This would be the first Bank-financed tourism project in Turkey.
II. THE TOURISM SECTOR
2.01        Turkey stands out among Mediterranean countries for its impres-
sive tourism resources. These include a pleasant climate in the coastal
areas with long dry summers and mild winters; a coastline of several thousand
kilometers along the Mediterranean, Aegean and Black Seas, with vast stretches
of unspoiled beaches, snow-capped mountain scenery, clear waters and varied
vegetation; a wealth of historical and archaeological sites scattered through-
out the country, and the remains of some of the oldest civilizations: Hittite,
Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Seljuk and Ottoman. In addition to excellent air
access, the country, unlike most other developing Mediterranean countries,
is easily reached by car and train.
2.02        Nevertheless, because of the hesitant attitude of previous govern-
ments toward tourism development, Turkey's tourism resources have remained
largely untapped. For example, Tunisia and Morocco attract more foreign
tourists than Turkey, and neighboring Greece twice as many.
2.03        In June 1975, there were 42,733 beds in registered tourism.estab-
lishments -- i.e., those which the Government recognizes as suitable for
international tourism. The annual rate of increase of these accommodations
had averaged about 8.5% in the 1963-1975 period. In 1975, there were also
an additional 214,000 beds in unregistered establishments. The bulk of
Turkey's accommodation capacity is concentrated in the Marmara and Aegean
regions, where the country's first and third largest cities, Istanbul and
Izmir, are located (Annex I, Tables 1-3).



-2-
2.04        The majority of the accommodations are owned by the private
sector. The Government owns and operates 13 hotels and holiday villages
comprising 12% of total registered capacity (Annex I, Table 4). Many of
the existing luxury and class A hotels and vacation villages are owned by
nationals, but managed under contract by foreign operators.
2.05        Occupancies vary greatly according to location.  In major
cities like Istanbul and Ankara, where visitors are predominantly business-
motivated and seasonal variation in demand is low, annual room occupancies
average around 75%. On the other hand, occupancies in Antalya follow
the general seasonal pattern of other beach-based Mediterranean tourism
centers, i.e., averaging 40-45% over the course of the year; from June to
September, occupancies attain 80-85% with several hotels reaching 90%
occupancy. Some of the hotels in resort areas do not operate during the off-
season.
2.06        Outpacing the development of registered accommodation capacity,
foreign tourist arrivals in Turkey increased five-fold during the period
1963-1973, rising from 155,000 to 776,000. Due to the energy crisis and the
Cyprus war, the number dropped to 662,000 in 1974 (Annex I, Table 5). Pre-
liminary estimates indicate that the growth of foreign tourist flows had
resumed in 1975.
2.07        The bulk of visitors in the past five years originated in West
Germany (17%), USA (16%), Great Britain (10%), France (9%) and Italy (6%).
In 1973-1974, the length of stay of tourists in Turkey averaged seven days.
The seasonal trend of foreign traffic followed a set pattern throughout the
1963-1974 period, with the summer months (June to September) accounting for
about 57% of total annual arrivals (Annex I, Tables 6-9).
2.08        In addition to tourist arrivals, Turkey receives a considerable
number of foreigners who visit the country for less than 24 hours. These
excursionists have increased from 44,000 to 562,000 in the period 1963-1973
(Annex I, Table 5). Because most of them were from the Greek Islands to
the Turkish ports of Istanbul, Izmir, Kusadasi, Marmara and Bodrum, the
decline in their number (34%) following the Cyprus war of 1974 was more pro-
nounced than that of tourists.
2.09        Because of its large population and rising living standards,
Turkey generates significant flows of domestic tourists. In 1974, the number
of visits to hotels by domestic tourists had attained an estimated three
million, representing a 10% average annual increase over the preceding 10
years. Much of domestic tourist traffic is toward coastal resorts. Forty
percent of total bednights in two recently opened vacation villages (Valtur and
Golden Dolphin) were by domestic tourists in 1975, notwithstanding the fact
that these two villages were designed primarily for international tourists.
2.10        In 1974, gross foreign exchange revenues from tourism amounted
to US$193.7 million representing some 13% of the country's total foreign
exchange receipts from the export of goods and non-factor services. Average
daily expenditure by foreign visitors was estimated at US$27. This figure



- 3-
includes expenditures by excursionists who, coming specifically to shop,
tend to spend more than the daily average of long-stay visitors.
2.11        During the season the hotel industry employs about 38,000 people.
Additional employment induced by tourism in restaurants, shops, tour agencies,
and in construction, handicrafts, transportation and other services is
estimated by the Government at 40,000 jobs.
2.12        The Ministry of Tourism and Information (Annex XII) is respon-
sible for setting tourism development targets, establishing tourism policies,
preparing regional tourism development plans, promoting the country's image
on the international tourism market, and supervising the operations of the
Tourism Bank, Inc. (TBI). TBI (Annex XII) established under corporate
law in 1960 as a State Economic Enterprise has the dual function of:
(a) engaging in banking operations, with emphasis on hotel credit; and
(b) participating directly in hotel investments (through constructing, leasing,
selling, owning and managing accommodation facilities). Between 1971 and 1974,
TBI lent US$18 million to finance a total of 109 tourism projects. With 770
rooms in hotels and vacation villages, TBI is now one of the biggest hotel
operating companies in Turkey.
2.13        From 1962 to 1975, the Government invested US$177 million in the
tourism sector. These expenditures comprised investments in infrastructure
(45%), hotels (30%), 1/ tourism promotion and hotel training schools (12%)
and restoration of historical sites.
2.14        Over the years, the Government has established a number of
incentives to stimulate private investment in hotel development. These
incentives include:
(a)  long-term loans at preferential terms (8% interest
rate, 15-year maturity, three-year grace period);
(b) favorable purchase or lease terms for development
sites;
(c) exemption from customs duties on imported materials
and equipment required for hotel construction; and
(d) tax relief including partial rebate of corporate tax,
and five-year exemption from real estate tax on
registered hotels.
The Turkish incentives system has a ntimber of weaknesses stemming from the
haphazard manner in which the benefits have been established - one at a
time, without an overall rational design. In the first place, it is doubtful
1/ Government direct investment in hotels is primarily through TBI and
the General Pension Fund.



-4-
whether the various incentives taken together satisfy actual needs or
whether the objective of sustained flows of private capital for hotel invest-
ment could not be attained with a different "mix" of incentives, entailing
less risk of resource misallocation and/or a lesser cost to the Government.
Secondly, the multiplicity of laws and regulations is confusing to potential
investors and difficult to administer for the Turkish authorities. The Govern-
ment has agreed to undertake a study under the project to remedy these weak-
nesses and improve the incentives system. A timetable for the study and its
terms of reference would be submitted for Bank approval within six months of
loan signing.
2.15       Law No. 6224 (Foreign Capital and Investment Encouragement Law)
extends to foreign investments all rights and incentives enjoyed by domestic
enterprises. It provides for the repatriation of profits, interest charges
and capital repayments on loans obtained abroad; the repatriation of capital
in the event of liquidation; and import of capital. Further, the law allows
foreign investors participating in joint ventures with local firms to use
"blocked funds" 1/ to finance their equity participations.
2.16       The MTI and the Ministry of National Education share the respon-
sibility for hotel training. The MTI operates four vocational training
centers (Ankara, Antalya, Istanbul, Izmir), each with a capacity of 100
students. A fifth center (Urgup) is planned for 1976. The centers have an
eight-month program in the basic trade skills combining classroom study with
working sessions in hotels. About 2,200 students have completed this training
since its inception in 1967 but poor buildings and equipment have restricted
budgets and have had an adverse impact on the quality of the courses. The
Ministry of National Education has three technical high schools for hotel
training (Ankara, Istanbul, Kusadasi) with a total capacity of 1,050 students.
A fourth school (Antalya), with a capacity of 500 students is planned for
1976. The technical high schools offer a three-year program of combined
formal education and summer working experience in hotels leading to a career
in middle management and thus provide effective professional training. About
2,000 students have graduated from the program since it was established in
1964 (Annex VII).
2.17       Turk Hava Yollari (THY) is the national airline for both scheduled
and chartered domestic and international flights. As a result of increasing
business, THY plans to create two additional companies, a domestic-only
carrier and a charter airline. About 16 other international carriers serve
Turkey through two international airports (Istanbul and Ankara). Izmir and
Antalya airports are also authorized to handle international charter flights
by T-.
1/ "Blocked Funds" originate from profits accumulated in the past by foreign
investors who were not granted repatriation authorization. They are
deposited in commercial banks and may be used only by permission of the
Central Bank of Turkey.



-5-
2.18       Turkey's growing need for foreign exchange has recently prompted
the Government to accord high priority to the tourism sector. The Third Five-
Year Development Plan (1973-1977) envisages a total investment in the tourism
sector of US$300 million (US$80 million more than in the previous plan).
Emphasis is placed on planned development of priority regions for mass tourism.
The Plan further calls for direct government participation in accommodation
development wherever private initiative proves inadequate. About a third of
the planned investment will be spent on infrastructure development and the
balance on tourist and lodging facilities. The Plan predicts that the number
of foreign tourists (including excursionists) in Turkey will grow by 13% per
annum and gross tourist receipts by 20%. With Turkey's vast tourist potential
and the Government's new commitment to the sector, the Plan's target may still
be achieved in spite of the negative repercussions of the 1974 Cyprus war.
III. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Area
3.01       Located on Antalya Bay, 35-50 km south of the city of Antalya
(pop. 100,000), the project area covers the rural settlement of Kemer and 6
other villages with a combined total population at present of 3,100. Tourism
development would be concentrated around Kiziltepe, Tekerlektepe, Kemer and
Guneydeniz (see maps). The northernmost site at Kiziltepe lies on a 2-km long,
gently curving beach and is surrounded by the heavily wooded foothills of the
Tekerlektepe mountains. Separated from Kiziltepe by a prominent hill, the
site at Tekerlektepe is located on a small enclosed bay. Both sites are
covered with pine forests. The tourist site at Kemer would be developed
along the beach to the north of the village and adjacent to the future small
craft harbor. The fourth site at Guneydeniz is located in a relatively flat
area dotted with orange groves which is surrounded by pine-covered mountains.
Most of the land for tourism development, being close to the beach, has
limited agricultural use. The beaches at the four selected sites are of good
quality and safe for swimming.
3.02       The area has a typical Mediterranean climate with dry and warm
summers and wet, mild winters. In summer, daytime temperatures range between
20 and 30 degrees centigrade and sea temperatures average 20 degrees centi-
grade. Rainfall is concentrated in the winter months and only a minimal
amount of precipitation is recorded from May to September.
3.03       The remains of three ancient cities are found in the project area:
Phaselis, a colony established by the Kingdom of Rhodes in the 7th century,
B.C.; Olympos, first recorded in history in the 2nd century B.C.; and Idyros,
a late Roman or early Byzantine development. With its extensive remains,
Phaselis is likely to be of great interest to tourists. Numerous other historic
sites outside the immediate project area, e.g., Side, are easily accessible
for day excursions.
3.04       Antalya airport is located approximately 50 km north of the project
area. Its 2,990-m runway can receive Boeing 727s and similar aircraft and the
passenger terminal is equipped to handle both domestic and international traffic.



Construction of an additional 3,400-m runway, taxiways and parking aprons,
including a separate charter flight parking area is underway. These extensions
will be sufficient to accommodate Boeing 707s and 747s.
3.05       A new harbor has been built approximately 30 km north of Kiziltepe,
to the west of Antalya. This harbor serves cargo ships primarily, while the
old port of Antalya continues to receive cruise ships.
3.06       The only road serving the project area leads from Antalya City to
Finike, 73 km southwest of Kemer.  Pavement extends as far as Kemer; from
there on the road is of lower standard.  In 1969, construction began on a new
highway from Antalya to Finike. This highway has already been completed to
Beldibi and some grading works have extended as far as Phaselis (see map).
3.07       The project area lacks water distribution, sewerage or electricity
supply systems. The only water supply is currently from groundwater wells.
Telephone facilities are limited to a small manned exchange at Kemer. The
existing Antalya City exchange is currently being connected with a national
microwave communications system.
3.08       Several small establishments such as motels, pensions and camping
sites are operated in the project area. The 350-room Valtur Holiday Village, 1/
located some 2 km south of Kemer, is the only significant tourism development.
3.09       Most of the land required for tourism development until 1981 is
already Government-owned but 25 ha remain in private hands. The MTI started
expropriation procedures for this land but landowners successfully contested
its action in court arguing, correctly, that firstly, no approved Master Plan
prescribing use of the area for tourism development existed and secondly, MTI
was not the competent agency to initiate expropriation. In January 1976 the
Government decided to give the private landowners in the project area an 8 to
10 month delay to enable them to make arrangements either to develop their
land themselves, in conformity with the tourism development plan, or to sell
or lease to private hotel developers. During negotiations agreement was
reached that for the land for which such arrangements have not been concluded,
expropriation procedures through the appropriate agency (the Land Office of
the MRR), would be initiated as a condition of effectiveness and that
acquisition would be completed before November 1, 1978. The Government has
also undertaken to promptly publicize among potential investors its intention
to expropriate this land and to lease it to them at reasonable rates. These
commitments by the Government would ensure that the privately-owned land
would become available on an acceptable schedule for hotel development at non-
speculative prices.
3.10       With respect to land within Kemer, as well as land required for
superstructure to be built after 1981 2/ (20 ha), the Government plans to
give private landowners the option either to develop their land themselves in
1/ In which IFC holds an 8.3% equity participation.
2/ Under Turkish law, land expropriated for a specific use must be put to
that use within five years or it reverts to its original owner. According-
ly, expropriation procedures for land to be used for the project after
1981 would be scheduled no more than fiup vpnrR in uArixnrn nF n       -n-nn-4--



conformity with the tourism development plan, or to sell or lease it to private
developers by an announced date after which acquisition procedures would be
initiated. In order to facilitate the participation of the local population
in tourism development, residents in the area should receive timely information
concerning the project and the opportunities that it offers them. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government would follow this
course of action.
B. Planning and Environmental Aspects
3.11       The physical planning basis for the proposed project is established
for the region of Antalya at a scale of 1:25,000 and, for individual development
areas, by detailed master plans at a scale of 1:5,000. The regional master
plan is completed and the local plans will shortly be finalized.
3.12       The plans would ensure the rational development of tourism in the
project area while preventing environmental deterioration. The concentration
within four separate sites would leave large undisturbed open spaces, it would
also ensure economic utilization of land and limit infrastructure costs. The
plans would provide for zoning regulations and building codes, to be administered
by the Ministry of Reconstruction and Resettlement, as elsewhere in Turkey,
specifying limitations on density and construction heights as well as other
technical standards.
3.13       The 32 ha site at Kiziltepe is planned to accommodate a total of
1,875 rooms by 1990, the 18 ha site at Tekerlektepe 625 rooms, and the 26 ha
Guneydeniz site 1,300 rooms. A residential area for summer residents and a
campground would be developed to the west of the Guneydeniz hotel zone. Other
campgrounds would be located in the national park, which surrounds the entire
project area. The fourth site at Kemer would be developed into a service center
with a commercial area, a small craft harbor (which would cater to the boating
requirements of all four sites), residential developments, a hotel training
center and administrative facilities. A total of 1,950 new rooms, including
the proposed practice hotel, would be constructed by 1990 at Kemer which would
eventually have a permanent population of approximately 7,000.
3.14       The master plan for the Antalya Region at a scale of 1:25,000 was
approved by the Ministry of Reconstruction and Resettlement on April 19, 1976.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) the regulations for the 1:25,000 master plan and
the detailed master plan (scale: 1:5,000) for
Kemer would be submitted for Bank acceptance and
be approved by the Ministry of Reconstruction and
Resettlement as conditions of effectiveness; and
(b) PRD would be given the right to review all
hotel projects prior to their approval by the
Ministry of Reconstruction and Resettlement.

4.  THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01       The proposed project which would be implemented in the period
1976-1981, would provide infrastructure to support private investment in
5,750 hotel and vacation village rooms at the four selected sites. The
project would consist of:
(a) completion of the main highway from Antalya
to the project area and construction of
access roads to the tourism sites;
(b) water supply, sewerage, solid waste disposal,
electricity and telecommunications for the
tourism sites;
(c) water supply, sewerage, electricity, telephone,
streets, sports accommodations, park, health
clinic and service buildings for the tourism
support center of Kemer;
(d) hotel training facilities;
(e) construction of housing for hotel employees;
(f) construction of a small craft harbor at Kemer;
(g) campgrounds, day-use beaches, beach and other
facilities in the national park;
(h) preservation works at the Phaselis archaeological
site; and
(i) funds for project management, studies and consultants.
4.02        The road works would complete the Beldibi-Tekirova section
(32 km) of the new Antalya-Finike highway and provide access roads to Kemer
and the tourism development sites at Kiziltepe, Tekerlektepe and Guneydeniz
(Annex IV). The highway would have a permanent width of 10 m, and the
access roads of 8 m.
4.03        The Guverte Spring, located 7.5 km west of Kemer at an altitude
of 480 m, will serve as the project area's main water source (Annex V).
While the spring has an average flow of 350 liters per second, there are
marked seasonal fluctuations and, consequently, provision has been made for
five back-up wells as alternative sources of water. Storage reservoirs
would be located at Kemer and Kiziltepe. A 39.5-km transmission main would
connect with distribution networks in Kemer, Guneydeniz, Kiziltepe and
Tekerlektepe as well as the proposed camping grounds and beach facilities.
4.04        The sewerage component comprises three separate collection net-
works and treatment plants for Kemer, Kiziltepe/Tekerlektepe and Guneydeniz
(Annex V). The collection networks have been designed for gravity flow.



After collection, sewage would be pumped to the treatment plants through force
mains. The treatment plants would consist of lagoons with mechanical aerators,
inlet structures, chlorination units and outlets for orange grove irrigation.
4.05        Solid waste would be disposed of at a site north of Kemer; as
succeeding portions of the site are filled, they would be reclaimed and
used for agricultural purposes. The solid waste disposal component would
comprise the stabilization of an existing access road, land preparation and
the provision of security fences, two trash-collection vehicles, one dump
truck and a bulldozer.
4.06        Electric power would be provided by Kepez A.S. Electric Company,
a private company which has a concession in the project area (Annex VI).
The electric power component includes a main 154-kV line from the Kepez power
plant near Antalya City to a new transformer substation at Kemer and a stand-
by supply system. The substation would be connected by 31.5 kV distribution
lines to all project sites plus Beldibi. The lines would be single circuit;
provision, however, has been made for upgrading to double circuits if the need
should arise in the future. During final design, the Borrower would satisfy
the Bank that the proposed solution for the standby supply system is economi-
cally and technically sound before disbursements for the system are made.
4.07        The telecommunications component is designed for 1990 user require-
ments and comprises a 300-channel microwave radio link between Antalya and
Kemer, a new telephone exchange in Kemer, upgrading the existing telephone
exchange in Antalya, a 45-km telephone network in the project area and telex
facilities to be leased to hotels (Annex IV). The Kemer microwave relay
station would link the project area to the national and international tele-
communications networks.
4.08        The Kemer infrastructure component would provide local networks
for water supply, sewerage and electricity, and the construction of streets,
parking areas and a stormwater drainage system (Annex IV). Other improve-
ments would include public parks and playgrounds, sports facilities and two
beaches for use by day visitors, a bus terminal and shopping facilities.
A health clinic constructed according to Turkish design standards for small
communities would serve the needs of both the local population and tourists
with a staff of three doctors.
4.09        The hotel training center in Kemer would have a capacity of 240
students with a potential annual output of 375 graduates (Annex VII). Courses
taught at the center would be at a basic level and would prepare the students
for nonmanagerial positions. In addition, part-time or evening courses would
be offered in languages and local history for the resident population. A
50-room practice hotel and a dormitory would be attached to the center. This
component would also include technical assistance to provide for curriculum
planning and teacher training (para. 6.05).
4.10        The project would provide up to 280 housing units in Kemer for
30% of hotel employees who would migrate to the area by 1981 (Annex IV). The
remaining personnel are expected either to be drawn from the area or to
commute from Antalya City. This limited housing program would contribute
to the development of the municipality of Kemer and would avoid the haphazard
development which might be expected if construction were left to individuals.



- 10 -
The MTI would own the houses and would lease them to hotel investors who
would make them available to their employees. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained: (a) that the construction of houses would be
undertaken only after such lease agreements had been reached between MTI
and hotel investors; and (b) that the Government would provide the necessary
funds for continuation of this housing program after 1981.
4.11        The small craft harbor together with the commercial center would
make Kemer an attractive focus for social activities (Annex IV). The harbor
component would consist of breakwaters, landing piers and navigational aids
as well as a yacht club combined with an administration building. Other
services would include boat handling and storage facilities, a boat maintenance
depot, public restrooms and parking areas. Two 40-passenger ferry/excursion
boats would also be provided.
4.12        The national park program would consist of beach facilities for
2,500 visitors daily, and three campsites, each with central sanitary facil-
ities, with a total of 900 tents. Also included are access roads to the
beach facilities and campsites, reforestation, 135 km of forest and mountain
trails, 25 km of walking and cycling paths, landscaping along highways and
construction of scenic lookout points. This component further provides for
an office building and a visitor center for the national park administration
in Kemer as well as communications equipment, two small boats with outboard
motors, a truck, two helicopters equipped for firefighting an%d.*everal fire
control towers.
4.13        The archaeological component is designed to enhance the impres-
sive remains of ancient Phaselis (Annex IV). Overgrown vegetation would be
cleared and an access road built; utility connections would be provided and
a pier built together with small buildings including an exhibition hall.
Security fences would be erected around the site. In addition, a conservation
study for Phaselis and an underwater archaeological survey would be undertaken
to determine the best way to preserve and restore the site.
4.14        The project provides funds for a project unit and consultants'
services in the fields of tourism promotion, small craft harbor management,
operation of public utilities and for an economic study on hotel profitability
and tourism incentives.
B. Cost Estimates
4.15        The detailed cost estimates, the foreign exchange components
and the contingency allocations for individual project elements are given in
Annex II and summarized in Table 1. Base line costs reflect December 1975
prices and include approximately 14% taxes on components with local or
indirect foreign exchange costs. No taxes nor import duties are included
in the estimates for the direct foreign exchange component.

4.16        Base line costs have been increased by 10% to allow for physical
contingencies; this limited percentage appears reasonable since most of the
cost estimates are based on reliable preliminary engineering data. Construc-
tion costs in Turkey have risen over 20% annually during the last two years.
To account for the impact of future increases in the local costs of labor,
materials and equipment, a 14-18% price increase per year is provided for
civil works, locally-procured equipment and professional services. To reflect
international cost increases, an annual 7-10% price increase provision has
been made for internationally-procured equipment. These price increases have
resulted in a price contingency of 53% of base line cost plus physical con-
tingencies (Annex II, Table 1).
4.17        Fees for professional services including final design, supervision
and special studies are estimated at TL 114 million (US$7.6 million) or 11% of
project cost. This would represent about 300-man-years of which about 15 would
be provided by expatriates.
4.18        Most building materials and one-third to one-half of the equipment
required for project implementation are produced locally. The local products,
however, contain a considerable indirect foreign exchange component. In view
of the construction capability of Turkish contractors and Government agencies,
it is expected that most of the civil works will be executed by Turkish organi-
zations. The overall foreign exchange component is estimated at 33% (US$22
million) of total project cost (US$66 million).
C. Amount of Loan and Lending Arrangements
4.19         The proposed loan of US$26 million would cover the foreign
exchange component of the project including interest during construction
(US$4 million) for the five-year period during which most construction
would take place. This inclusion would increase the Bank's participation
in the project from 33% of project cost to 37% of total financing required,
the latter being considered an appropriate percentage for a first Bank-financed
tourism project in Turkey. Retroactive financing in the amount of US$300,000
(or 0.4% of total project cost) is proposed for the foreign exchange cost of
(a) professional services for all project components provided between the time
of appraisal (November 1975) and loan signing, and (b) construction of the main
access road between March 1, 1976 (the beginning of the Turkish fiscal year)
and loan signing.
4.20         The proposed loan would be to the Government of Turkey which would
make US$17.6 million available to the Ministry of Tourism and Information for
implementation of all project components except electric power and telecom-
munications. The electricity component would be executed by Kepez A.S. and
the telecommunications component by PTT. The Government would onlend the
equivalent of US$2.6 million for electricity and US$1.8 million for telecom-
munications at 11% over 10 years with a 3-year grace period. The signing
of subsidiary loan agreements with Kepez A.S. and PTT, satisfactory to the
Bank, would be conditions of loan effectiveness.



- 13 -
D. Procurement and Disbursement
4.21        With the exception of road construction and other minor civil works
(together not to exceed US$4.0 million) which would be on force account, major
civil works and equipment contracts would be awarded under international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Project items would be
grouped to the extent possible in order to encourage such competitive bidding.
Local competitive bidding would be used for civil works contracts up to
US$500,000 and equipment contracts up to US$100,000. The total amount of such
contracts is estimated not to exceed US$2.5 million. In order to attract both
local and foreign bids, contracts would be broken down into elements which
would be tendered individually or combined into bidding groups at the bidders'
option. in evaluating international bids for equipment contracts, domestic
manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% of the CIF price
of competing imports or the prevailing level of customs duties, whichever is
lower.
4.22        The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of all
project components. Disbursements would cover 100% of the foreign exchange
cost of imported equipment and materials, or 100% of the ex-factory cost of
the locally manufactured equipment and furniture procured under ICB, or 80%
of imported items procured locally; 100% of the foreign exchange cost of
consultants' services; 30% of the cost of civil works (representing the
estimated foreign exchange component) and interest and other charges due under
the loan up to April 14, 1980. Disbursement for the roads and other civil
works carried out under force account will be made against a certificate of
expenditure, the documentation for which is not submitted for review, but is
retained by the Borrower and available for inspection by the Bank during the
course of a project supervision mission. Consultants' services and civil
works would be eligible for retroactive financing in an amount not exceeding
US$300,000 equivalent, for expenditures after November 15, 1975. The percent-
age for civil works would be adjusted, if necessary, during the implementation
period of the project in order that withdrawals from the loan would continue
pro rata throughout the implementation period. A schedule of disbursements
is given in Annex III, Table 2.
5. ORGANIZATION
5.01        The Ministry of Tourism and Information will have general respon-
sibility for the project and will establish a Project Directorate (PRD) for
project execution and operation. While the PRD would directly implement such
project components as water and sewerage, housing and urban infrastructure,
other works would be carried out by other specialized Government agencies
(see Table 2). PRD would rely on agreements with PTT and Kepez (private or
semi-private institutions) for the implementation of the telecommunications
and electric power components. Conclusion of appropriate agreements satis-
factory to the Bank would be conditions of effectiveness.
5.02        Coordination among the executing agencies will be assured at the
policy level by the existing Tourism Coordinating Committee which is respon-
sible for coordination of the tourism sector in general. It is chaired by the



- 14 -
Minister of Tourism and Information and attended by the undersecretaries of
state of all relevant ministries. 1/ At the working level, two subcommittees
would be established specifically for the proposed project. The first, the
South Antalya Tourism Project Coordinating Committee would be chaired by a
Deputy Undersecretary of MTI and have responsibility for coordinating the pro-
ject in Ankara. The second, the South Antalya Tourism Project Coordinating
Subcommittee, under the chairmanship of the Governor of Antalya, would coordi-
nate the project at the local level. Establishment of these two subcommittees
would be conditions of effectiveness.
5.03        During the execution and construction stage of the project, the
PRD would:
(a) supervise completion of the detailed master plan
for the project area and prepare time schedules
for the implementation of the various project
components;
(b) approve agreements between the executing agencies
and consultants, contractors and suppliers;
(c) clear the agencies' authorizations for payments
under the project;
(d) expedite approval of plans, land acquisition
and issuance of hotel construction permits;
(e) execute those project components to be
constructed by MTI;
(f) install and maintain an accounting system for
the project;
(g) approve individual investors' hotel plans and
offer investment advice; and
(h) establish and maintain public relations with
the local community.
5.04        During the operational phase of the project, PRD, and eventually
the municipality of Kemer, would promote superstructure development by nego-
tiating with potential investors and helping with land lease agreements. In
order to facilitate land leasing, MTI would sign a protocol with the
Ministries of Finance and Forestry setting out the terms under which PRD
would help in land lease negotiations (including an agreement to rescind leases
if construction is not started within a specified period). Agreement was
1/ The Ministries involved are: Internal Affairs, Finance, National Education,
Public Works, Public Health and Social Welfare, Customs and Monopolies,
Transportation, Industries and Technology, Commerce, Reconstruction and
Resettlement, Rural Affairs and Cooperatives, Forestry and Culture.



- 15 -
obtained during negotiations that a protocol acceptable to the Bank would
be signed within one year of loan effectiveness. PRD would operate and
maintain those project components which would later be taken over by the
municipality of Kemer. 1/ Finally, PRD would monitor the social impact of
the project through a sociologist who would be added to its staff on a part-
time or full-time basis. Agreement was obtained during negotiations that
MTI would submit a program for operation of project facilities to be accept-
able to the Bank within two years of loan signing.
5.05       PRD has been established and during negotiat,1ons agreement was
reached on its terms of reference and staffing. During negotiations, agree-
ment was obtained that a project director who meets standards of qualification
and experience for the position satisfactory to the Bank would be appointed
and assurances received that the Bank would be consulted in advance should
the project director be replaced. Appointment of the director would be a
condition of effectiveness.
5.06       PRD would be assisted by the Tourism Bank, Inc. (TBI) which would
act as a consultant, i.e., prepare final design and bidding documents, assist
in the evaluation of bids and supervise construction of components to be
executed by PRD. This arrangement would facilitate execution of the project
by (a) providing continuity (the Tourism Bank prepared the preliminary
engineering design), and (b) saving time on procurement procedures and the
hiring of personnel since the Tourism Bank operates under private law (Law No.
440) as a State Economic Enterprise. During negotiations, assurances were
received that an agreement satisfactory to the Bank be reached between MTI
and its consultants as a condition of effectiveness.
1/ Under the Turkish Law, the village of Kemer can become a municipality,
with autonomous budget and public services as soon as it attains 2,000
inhabitants.

VI  ACCOMMODATION AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT
A. Accommodations
6.01        The proposed construction schedule For hotels and vacation
villages would bring into operation the following number of rooms (Annex VIII):
Vacation     Total      Cumulative
Year               Hotels      Villages      Rooms       Total
1975 (existing)         -         350         350         350
1976-1981          1,600          650       2,250       2,600
1982-1986          1,850          375       2,225       4,825
1987-1990            775          500       1,275       6,100
The accommodations, designed to appeal to a diversified market, would include
first-class hotels (16% of total rooms), medium-class (53%) and vacation
villages (31%).
6.02        Investor interest in South Antalya has already been evidenced.
Prospective investors, predominantly Turkish (80%), have already submitted
specific proposals to MTI for the construction of 3,600 rooms during the early
stages of the project. Further investor interest is expected once the
project has been approved and investors are assured of the availability of
infrastructure, trained personnel and hotel credit on reasonable terms.
6.03        The project should be attractive to investors since they would
enjoy the advantages inherent in a resort area developed within an integrated
and carefully planned physical framework: they would be provided with long-
term ground leases on reasonable terms; they would be able to count on
efficient utilities; they would benefit from the presence of community shopping
and recreational facilities; and they would have reassurances that the environ-
ment in which they were investing would not be downgraded.
6.04        Investors would find a pool of staff trained locally.  While
middle-level hotel personnel would be trained at the technical high school
for hotel studies at Antalya, the new hotel training center at Kemer would
train some 375 entry-level personnel annually. Since their IPF is already
complete, UNDP cannot finance this technical assistance and no other suitable
source has been identified. Funds have therefore been included in the pro-
ject for the technical assistance.   During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that: (a) a curriculum and a teacher training program will be
1/ On an annual basis, room occupancy would be 45%.



- 18 -
prepared by consultants and presented to the Bank for approval within twelve
months of loan signing; and (b) the Government would make sufficient funds
available for the operation of the hotel training center.
6.05        Hotel credit requirements are estimated at about TL 760 million
(US$50.7 million) in total, with a peak of TL 90 million (US$60.0 million) in
1979. Although the Tourism Bank has been providing about TL 80 million (US$5.3
million) in hotel credit annually for the last three years, it does not have
the necessary resources to provide all the debt financing for South Antalya in
addition to its other lending operations. Other Turkish organizations, e.g.,
banks and pension funds, and possibly international organizations, are expected
to provide the balance of required hotel credit. During negotiations, assurances
were received that the Government would provide the necessary complementary
financing on terms and conditions suitable for long-term hotel financing, should
funds from other channels fall short of requirements.
6.06        Funds have been included in the project to finance a hotel invest-
ment/management adviser at PRD whose role would be to prequalify and aid
investors in planning hotels for efficient operation and in negotiating suit-
able management contracts. During negotiations, agreement was obtained that
a hotel adviser, with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank,
would be appointed within six months of loan signing.
6.07        Despite South Antalya's attractiveness to investors, the risk
remains that hotel investment might not be forthcoming. To ensure completion
of the project after the infrastructure has been installed, the Turkish Govern-
ment would undertake to build sufficient hotel rooms to attain acceptable rates
of return on infrastructure outlays. Construction of 3,825 rooms (56% of the
total proposed under the project) would assure an economic rate of return of
about 14% which is considered acceptable in Turkey. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that the Government would take steps to ensure that
this minimum number of rooms would be in operation by 1989, provided that the
Government and the Bank agree that a potential market for these rooms exists.
B. The Market
6.08        Due to a lack of suitable international class hotel facilities,
few foreign visitors stay on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. The only
establishments in the Antalya region which can be considered of international
standard are the Valtur  Vacation village (350 rooms) opened in 1973 and the
Antalya Hotel (150 rooms) opened in 1975. The project would therefore
establish a virtually new resort which would, for the first time, tap the
European mass market.
6.09         South Antalya has excellent potential for developing this kind
of tourism. Its main advantages are: (a) ideal weather for eight months
of the year, longer than for most destinations in the Mediterranean; (b) a
dramatic landscape of forested mountains set against the blue sea; (c) an
outstanding excursion potential to ancient cities and sites such as Side,



- 19 -
Perge, Olympos, Termessos, Aspendos, Konya and Cappadocia; (d) proximity to
Antalya, an interesting urban and regional center; and (e) relatively easy
air access from most European tourist-generating countries.
6.10        Western Europe will be the major target market for the project,
particularly Germany and Scandinavia, followed by the U.K., Austria,
Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The large majority of visitors is expected
to arrive by air. A broad range of prices and accommodation facilities would
be offered to attract a varied clientele.
6.11        The project will offer mainly single-destination holidays, with
or without tours to other parts of Turkey. A broad choice of holiday
packages ranging from long weekends to three and four weeks is foreseen. The
land portion of a two-week package, for example, is estimated between US$164
and US$286 in hotels, 1/ and about US$240 in vacation villages. 2/ Allowing
for air transport costs and tour operators' margins, the resultant package
prices for South Antalya would be competitive with those offered for Greece,
Rhodes, Cyprus, the Middle East and Southern Mediterranean destinations.
Turkey also offers outstanding values outside hotels for such items as food,
entertainment and souvenirs.
6.12        Room occupancy rates during the season is estimated at 45% in the first
year of hotel operation rising to 75% in the fourth. This implies that hotels
would be able to operate during a relatively long season of 210 days, with
occupancies at 90% in July and August, and 60-80% in the shoulder months.
These occupancies appear reasonable in the light of local climactic conditions,
travel habits in the major tourist generating countries in the northern Europe
and experience in existing resort in the Eastern Mediterranean, including
South Antalya, Rhodes and Cyprus.
6.13        Assuming an average of 1.9 persons per room and an average length
of stay of 10 days (see Annex IX), the total number of visitors staying at
South Antalya in 1985, when 4,175 rooms would be in operation, would be 116,000;
by 1990, when all 5,750 rooms would be available, traffic would increase to
about 163,000 visitors. Since there is substantial domestic demand for travel,
particularly during the shoulder months at the beginning and the end of the
season when hotel rates would be lower than at the peak, about 20% of arrivals
may be expected to be Turkish. Thus, the foreign arrivals would total 93,000
and 131,000 in 1985 and 1990, respectively.
6.14        The projected number of foreign arrivals at South Antalya appears
reasonable in the context of projections of foreign visitors to Turkey and
the Mediterranean generally. 3/ Total tourist arrivals in Mediterranean
1/ Double occupancy, 2 meals daily, transfers, taxes and services included.
2/ Double occupancy, all meals, transfers, taxes and services included.
3/ The figures in this paragraph are taken from the study of Mediterranean
tourism by Battelle Institute (Geneva) commissioned in 1975 by Mediter-
ranean DFCs, with the Bank as executing agency.



- 20 -
destination countries doubled between 1965 and 1973 to 50 million, and they
are projected to reach 90 million by 1981. Arrivals in Turkey are projected
at about 1.6 million by 1985, representing a growth rate of about 10% compared
with 6% for the whole Mediterranean region. Turkey's market share would thus
grow from about 1% in 1973 to 1.88% by 1985.  Even if Turkish growth rates
were to stabilize at the same level as the whole region (6%), total arrivals
in Turkey would reach 1.7 million by 1990 (Annex IX, Table 1). Foreign
arrivals at South Antalya would then be equal to 8% of total arrivals in
Turkey under this hypothesis. However, under the more likely assumptions of
a 10% growth rate for Turkey, South Antalya arrivals would equal only about
4% of arrivals in Turkey in 1990. Such a small share of the total traffic
appears to be a realistic target, in view of the latent demand for beach
tourism in Turkey and the comparative advantages of South Antalya.
6.15        South Antalya is well placed to participate in the Northern
European market which has been spreading from the western and central
Mediterranean to the east. This trend has already been noted in the nearby
offshore Greek island of Rhodes which has enjoyed a dramatic development of
tourism. In 1959, when charter flights started arriving, there were no more
than 600 rooms on Rhodes; by 1973, room capacity had expanded to 9,000. For
the 1973-1974 season lasting from Easter to November 10, room occupancy was
an estimated 75%. This represents a growth from about 15,000 visitors in
1959 to almost 220,000 in 1973. Cyprus was a similar success with arrivals
increasing at an annual average of more than 33% over the nine-year period,
1965-1973.
6.16        The marketing program for the project should be so phased that
tour operators' contracts for the early years are signed well in advance
of the co.mnencement of operations. Such a program should therefore be
devised, in close consultation with hotel investors, during the construction
phase of the project. Assurances were received during negotiations that
PRD would retain consultants, with qualifications and experience acceptable
to the Bank, within twelve months of loan signing, to prepare such a program.
6.17        A potential bottleneck, which might impede development of South
Antalya, is Turkey's civil aviation policy with respect to air traffic rights.
The project assumes a rapid increase in international traffic, much of it
carried on charter aircraft. THY is naturally eager to participate in this
traffic growth, but the company's fleet size, together with the requirements
of the travel trade in the market countries, suggest that at least half the
traffic to South Antalya will be by foreign charter lines. Furthermore,
direct international scheduled service to Antalya is required so that diversi-
fied marketing can be assured and undue dependence on charter operations
avoided. The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (Ministry of Trade) does
not, in principle, object to Antalya becoming available for international
operations eventually, but prefers not to change its status until market
requirements demand it. Assurances were received during negotiations
that: (a) the Government would permit foreign charter operations to Antalya
to supplement THY's charter services to the extent required to make the
project viable; and (b) the Government would declare Antalya airport open
for scheduled international service and make its best efforts to conclude
bilateral negotiations for landing rights with the major tourist-generating
countries.

VII. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
7.01        Financial flows for the project will be generated by several Govern-
ment agencies. Accordingly, revenue and expense statements have been prepared
for separate components (Annexes V, VI, VII, VIII and X). The project has been
analyzed, overall, in terms of a funds flow consolidating all project components
(Annex X). Financial objectives would be to recover investment costs fully plus
a reasonable rate of return through appropriate user charges. 1/
A. Infrastructure
7.02        PRD would construct the water and sewerage components and operate
them until the municipality of Kemer is created. Water and sewage tariffs would
be structured so that the different categories of consumer would be charged
on the basis of the real long-term marginal cost of providing the service,
taking into account their individual capacity to pay. This would entail cross-
subsidization of tariffs from hotels to smaller domestic consumers. Projections
(Annex V) indicate that the rate of return on these components would be in
excess of 6% of net water and sewerage assets by 1986 and that adequate debt
service coverage would be maintained from 1982 onwards. The DCF rate of return
on water and sewerage is 8.7%.
7.03        Electric power would be provided by Kepez which will bill its
major users (e.g., hotels) directly and sell electricity to all other consumers
through PRD. A fee would be charged by PRD for its services. Kepez' present
tariff structure assures a reasonable rate of return on net assets employed.
The project component would represent about 7% of Kepez' total energy sales
by 1983. Kepez' financial situation is reviewed in Annex VI.
7.04        The Post, Telegraph and Telephone (PTT) would provide the tele-
communications services under normal contract arrangements with the end users
in the project area. PTT is operating under sound public utilities regulations
and earns a reasonable rate of return on its assets. Services to be provided
under the project would be subject to national tariffs charged to the various
users.
7.05        Projections for the hotel training center are given in Annex VII.
Revenue from the practice hotel will cover part of the operating budget of
the center (approximately 28%). Annual budget allocations will be necessary
to enable the center to fully cover its operating expenses.
7.06        PRD will operate as a unit within MTI, with annual cash budgetary
allocations, and will have no commercial accountability. Therefore, only
operating projections have been made and are shown in Annex X, Table 2. PRD
1/ With the exception of the highway component and certain other minor
components (e.g., health clinic).

would derive revenue from the leasing of buildings including shops, the bus
terminal and small industrial facilities, restaurants, the small craft harbor
and the two pleasure boats; the collection of electricity charges from non-
hotel users; and charges for services such as solid waste disposal relating
to the maintenance of common facilities and amenities. In addition, for the
purposes of analysis, ground rent for hotels has been included as revenue
accruing to PRD; however, this may accrue to other ministries under Turkey's
financial system. Ground rent was calculated using the Ministry of Finance
guideline of 0.6% of project cost as a basis. The theoretical rate of return
on gross assets administered by PRD would amount to 12% when the project
reaches its full operating level (if ground rents were deducted the rate would
fall to 10%).
7.07        The remaining components include employee housing, the national
park and the Phaselis archaeological site. The Ministries responsible for
these components (MTI, the Ministries of Forestry and Culture, respectively)
have no commercial accountability and operate on annual cash allocations.
Projections (Annex X, Table 1) indicate that gross operating profits for the
national park and Phaselis would be about 75% of total revenues; rentals
charged to hotels for employee housing ensure that capital and operating
costs are recovered.
7.08        Annex X, Table 3, gives a forecast of the funds flow for the
project. The following table shows estimated fund requirements for the pro-
ject during the construction period and the sources from which they will be
met.

The Bank loan would be made to the Government at 8.85% interest for 25 years
including a 6-year grace period. It has been assumed that the Bank would
finance US$4 million interest during construction. The Government would make
available the proceeds of the Bank loan and counterpart funds as budgetary
trsnsfers to the Ministries and Government agencies involved in project execu-
tion. For electric power, however, US$2.6 million would be onlent by the
Government to Kepez for 10 years including 3 years of grace at 11% interest
to cover the foreign exchange element of this component; Kepez has agreed to
finance the balance of funds necessary. For telecommunications, the Government
would onlend US$1.8 million to PTT for 10 years including 3 years of grace at
11% interest.
7.09       The financial results of the overall infrastructure (excluding the
highway component) have been assessed in terms of a consolidated rate of
return. On this basis, the consolidated DCF financial rate of return on the
project would be about 8%.
B. Superstructure
7.10       At an average seasonal occupancy of 75% and average daily per
guest expenditures inside hotels projected at TL 290 (US$19.33), the gross
operating profit on hotels (32% of total revenue) will be adequate to cover
financial charges. The hotels would have an overall internal rate of return
of 9.7%. Although this rate may seem low compared to investments in other
sectors, it is acceptable for hotels and reflects the long-term nature of
hotel investments and the fact that investors look for advantages in hotels
(inflation hedge, tax shelter) other than rates of return. The financial
analysis of hotels is detailed in Annex VIII.
7.11        In order to obtain an indication of the possible financial outcome
of an investment in a single establishment, the rate of return was calculated
for a theoretical 250-room vacation village. This resulted in a project rate
of return of 10.8% and returns to equity of 13.3% in constant prices.
C. Financial Covenants
7.12        Because of the nature of project operations, the financial pro-
jections do not represent standards of performance which can be regulated by
a rate of return criterion. Control should be established through a financial
policy designed to set appropriate user charges for project facilities and
services. These charges should include tariffs for water and sewerage, ground
rent, service charges building rentals and certain fees (e.g., day-use beach
entrance and campsite fees). Assurances were obtained that the Government
would prepare, within one year of loan signing for approval by the Bank, a
list of objectives, the methodology for calculating tariffs, selling prices
and rental charges, as well as procedures for their implementation, the
substance of which was agreed during negotiations.
7.13        PRD expects to hand over management of the water and sewerage, the
small harbor and Kemer infrastructure to the municipality of Kemer (para. 5.04).
Agreement was obtained during negotiations that PRD's responsibilities under the
project would be taken over by its successor on conditions acceptable to the Bank.



- 24 -
D. Accounts and Auditing
7.14           During negotiations, assurances were obtained that an adequately
staffed section of the PRD will establish and maintain a set of accounts, accept-
able to the Bank, for implementation and operation of the project.  Assurances
were also received that these accounts would be subject to an annual indepen-
dent audit by auditors acceptable to the Bank and that audit reports would be
submitted to the Bank within four months of the close of the fiscal year.
8. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
8.01        The South Antalya tourism project is designed to provide basic
infrastructure support for a major development of tourism facilities, and also
for a corresponding expansion of the local population's need for utilities
and other public services. For purposes of economic justification, therefore,
the overall investment program for the area is taken to include both the
infrastructure construction costs and the costs of developing hotels and
related commercial activities. Accordingly, the rate of return calculations
are based on the projected costs and benefits of this overall investment
program. Since the accommodation facilities are expected to serve primarily
foreign tourists who would come to Turkey on the basis of a prearranged,
charter-flight package and who would arrive and depart from Antalya Airport,
the primary impact of their expenditures would be limited essentially to the
South Antalya area.
8.02        The gross benefits resulting from the development of tourism in
South Antalya, in terms of market values, would be the expenditures in the
project area of tourists who stay in the resort accommodation (or camping)
facilities. For certain of the infrastructure components, additional benefits
will be generated for the local population. The relevant costs, in market
values, are the capital and operating costs of the infrastructure provided
under the proposed project, and of the related superstructure facilities to
be built by the private sector. The cost and benefit assumptions and the
adjustments made to financial (market) values in order to arrive at economic
values are described in Annex XI.
8.03        Because of the rather limited development of resort facilities
in Turkey up to now, the projected visitor bednights in the project area may
be assumed to represent incremental tourism traffic to Turkey, rather than a
diversion of demand from existing destinations in the country. In the event
that the project did not go ahead, it is unlikely that any significant develop-
ment of tourism facilities oriented to foreign tourism demand would occur in
the area, given the absence of supporting infrastructure. For this reason,
the cost and benefits "with" the project are assumed to be entirely incremental
as compared to the situation "without" the project.
8.04        Revenue assumptions for the hotels and related superstructure
facilities have been based on the demand forecasts referred to in para. 6.02,
and on an average daily expenditure of TL 404, including sales taxes, made up



- 25 -
of TL 290 in the hotels for both Turkish and foreign tourists, and TL 120
and TL 90, respectively, outside of accommodation facilities. Approximately
80% of these expenditures would represent foreign exchange receipts. While
the superstructure facilities would receive revenue directly from the tourists,
the revenue earning infrastructure components would be compensated indirectly
through the payment of user-charges by those superstructure facilities.
Accordingly, the revenue and cost streams of individual project components
have been carefully analyzed so as to avoid double counting.
8.05        Investment costs have been derived from the financial estimates
of construction costs (or purchase prices) for the infrastructure components
of the project, plus the estimated capital costs of the hotels and vacation
villages and of the related superstructure outside accommodation facilities.
The operating costs and the corresponding gross operating profits for the
hotels are based on the projected financial results described in Annex IX.
The gross operating profits relating to expenditures outside hotels are
analyzed in Appendix 2 of Annex XI, and the gross operating profits for the
National Park operations are based on the estimated financial results de-
scribed in Annex X. Assumptions on the operating, maintenance and replace-
ment costs for non-revenue earning infrastructure components are described
in Annex XI.
A. Economic Rate of Return
8.06        The cost and benefit streams based on the assumptions referred
to above are summarized in Table 1 of Annex XI. With a 25-year discounting
horizon, the internal economic rate of return on the overall investment
program would be 17.2%. Approximately three percentage points of this are
attributable to the use of an effective exchange rate (reflecting import
and export duties), with another 1.5 percentage points resulting from the use
of efficiency prices for land and labor. The remaining difference between
the financial and economic rates of return on the overall investment program
(approximately 3.5 percentage points) are attributable to direct government
taxes (primarily the 10% sales tax on most tourist expenditures).
8.07        The sensitivity of this rate of return to alternative assumptions
regarding investment costs and gross operating profits is indicated in the
table below:
Alternative Assumptions            Resulting Rate of Return (%)
(a) Investment Costs
(i)  + 10%                               15.8
(ii)  - 10%                               19.1
(b) Gross Operating Profit
(i)  + 10%                               19.0
(ii)  - 10%                               15.6
(c) Superstructure Development
Delayed
(i)  by 1 year                           16.8
(ii)  by 2 years                          15.8
(iii)  by 3 years                          15.0



- 26 -
B. Distribution of Project Benefits
8.08        The three main beneficiaries of the project would be:  (a) the
Government; (b) the workers to be employed in tourism activities, and also
other local residents of the area; and (c) the private sector businessmen
who would invest in the hotels and related tourism facilities. The rates
of return on equity in hotels is expected to be-about 13% and somewhat higher
for other superstructure. In the long run these financial returns are unlikely
to differ significantly from returns available in other sectors, with due
allowance for risks.
8.09        The workers (and their families) who are employed in tourism
activities as a result of the project would benefit primarily funm the higher
level of remuneration in tourism, as compared with their employment opportu-
nities in other sectors taking into account the training they would receive,
either on-the-job or in the proposed hotel school. The investments in urban
improvements for Kemer, improvements to the Antalya-Tekirova highway, the
extension of electric power into South Antalya, and the development of other
local utilities would eventually benefit most of the area's inhabitants,
including those not directly involved in the tourism sector itself.
8.10        The Central Government would benefit both directly and indirectly
from its investments in the area. In addition to the direct returns from
revenue earning infrastructure components (including PRD), the Government
would receive direct sales tax receipts (10% of sales) on the expenditures of
tourists for accommodation, food and beverages. Sales taxes alone are pro-
jected to amount to TL 920 million (US$61.3 million) over the life of the
project, equal to about 144% of the Government contribution to financing the
project. In addition, the Government would receive indirect taxes and duties
on items purchased by the tourism industry, as well as income taxes on firms
and individuals engaged directly in the tourism sector.
8.11        While it is difficult to be very precise about the relative
distribution of the project's economic surpluses among these three groups of
beneficiaries, a rough approximation would suggest that workers will receive
about 12-18% (the excess of market wages over the efficiency wage rate), the
private sector about 35-40% (financial returns on commercial activities) and
the Government about 50-55% (including the returns on revenue earning infra-
structure and the 10% sales tax on tourist expenditures).
C. Balance of Payments and Employment Effects
8.12        The foreign exchange costs of the proposed infrastructure invest-
ments would be covered by the IBRD loan. The foreign exchange costs of the
hotels and holiday villages would amount to about 20-25% of their investment
costs, and thus would roughly be covered by the anticipated foreign capital
inflow from foreign investors and lenders.
8.13        From 1978 onward, the expenditures of foreign tourists are pro-
jected to result in substantial inflows of foreign exchange earnings, as
indicated in the table below. The outflow of foreign exchange as a result



- 27 -
of the project's operations would include the import component of operating
costs for hotels and other superstructure activities, and also the import
component of replacement costs. Additional outflows of foreign exchange
would be required in order to service foreign debt (both the IBRD loan and
the foreign loans obtained from hotels) and for the payment of dividends to
foreign equity investors. These foreign exchange receipts and costs are
described in detail in Annex XI, Appendix 3, and are summarized below for
selected years (TL/US$ millions, in constant prices):
Balance of Payments Effect

1978     41.2       2.7      5.3    0.3      35.9          2.4
1983    357.8      23.9     93.0    6.2    264.8          17.7
1988    494.8      33.0    121.7    8.1    373.1          24.9
1993    564.8      37.7    124.6    8.4    440.2          29.3
8.14        The development of hotels and other superstructure facilities
is expected to generate a substantial number of jobs in the South Antalya
area, as shown in the table below. During the implementation of the infra-
structure components (1976-1981), there will also be a sizeable number of
construction workers employed in the project area. Because of the relatively
long period of development for hotels and other superstructure facilities,
many of those workers would remain employed in construction activities over
the period 1976-1989, nearly 15 years. In addition to employment generated
directly in the hotels, shops, nightclubs, restaurants and excursion activi-
ties, an estimated 0.75 indirect jobs for every direct job are expected to
be created in related sectors (such as handicraft, agriculture, food proces-
sing, furniture manufacturing, distribution, etc.). The assumptions used to
arrive at these estimates are described in detail in Annex XI, Appendix 4.
The employment projections for selected years are summarized in the table
below:

IX. SOCIAL DMPACT
9.01          The project has been designed to take into account the following
social and cultural aspects:
(a) The local population will derive considerable
benefits as the region develops from the new
and improved infrastructure which has been
designed on the basis of permanent and seasonal
population forecasts.
(b) The restoration and conservation of archaeological
monuments and sites of natural beauty will inculcate
in the local population a sense of the importance
and value of the region's cultural heritage. Some
would be trained as tourist guides for historical
sites which would make them increasingly conscious
of their unique culture.
(c) The local population will derive considerable benefits
from the improvement of Kemer as a center for the
region with expanded health facilities, a bus station,
a harbor which can be used by local fishermen.
(d) Staff housing which often results in serious problems
is being provided under conditions which should ensure
a stable working population.
(e) The project will be developed following an approved
master plan which would ensure that the project would
have no deleterious environmental effects.
9.02          A limited survey undertaken in the project area indicates that
the majority of the population has a positive attitude toward foreign tourists
and an interest in the development of tourism. Thus, the outcome of diverse
cultural contacts may be expected to be positive.
9.03          The local population will benefit from new employment opportu-
nities and increased income. Although unemployment appears to be limited,
existing underemployment will be alleviated since a portion of the largely
agricultural population will be drawn into tourism-related activities and
such handicrafts as weaving, copper working and wood carving which will
provide a source of secondary income. Since the region cannot supply all
the manpower needed for tourism development, there will be some opportunity
for people in depressed locations to migrate to the tourism area. In
addition, unemployment in the city of Antalya, some 40 km from the project
area, will decrease during the tourist season due to the recruitment of a
sizeable number of inhabitants for the tourism area.



- 29 -
9.04        Demand for food by the hotels and the expanded permanent popula-
tion of the area will stimulate the agricultural activity in the region,
especially the production of fruit and vegetables, for which soils and climate
are favorable. The farmers have already begun to plan new orange groves and
to build additional greenhouses. The Government is planning to expand the
agricultural extension service in the area and to promote improved storage and
marketing of agricultural products.
X. RECOMMENDATIONS
10.01       During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government
would
(a)  carry out a study on economic study; examine
hotel profitability and the effect of the
incentives program (para. 2.14);
(b)  acquire land needed for superstructure through
1981 within two years of loan effectiveness
(para. 3.09);
(c)  inform the local population of the project
and opportunities it offers; apply procedures
wherein private landowners in the Kemer urban
development area as well as in areas required
for superstructure to be built after 1981, would
be given the option of either developing the
land themselves, in conformity with the tourism
development plan, or selling or leasing it to
private developers by an announced date (para.
3.10);
(d)  submit the regulations for the 1:25,000 master
plan and the detailed land-use plans (scale:
1:5,000) for Kemer for approval by the Bank and
approve them by effectiveness (para. 3.14);
(e)  ensure that PRD would be given the right to review
all hotel projects prior to their approval by the
Ministry of Reconstruction and Resettlement
(para. 3.14);
(f)  build housing to be undertaken only after lease
agreements between MTI and hotel investors are
agreed and that the latter would make the housing
available to their employees (para. 4.10);
(g) provide the necessary funds for continuing a
housing program after 1981 (para. 4.10);



- 30 -
(h) agree to prepare a protocol acceptable to the Bank
between the Ministries of Finance and Forestry
detailing the conditions under which PRD would
assist in land management for the project area
within a year of loan signing (para. 5.04);
(i) agree to submit a program for operation of the
project's facilities acceptable to the Bank
within two years of loan signing (para. 5.04);
(j) appoint a project director and successors meeting
standards of qualification and experience accept-
able to the Bank (para. 5.05)
(k) prepare a curriculum and a teacher training program
with the assistance of consultants acceptable to the
Bank within twelve months of loan signing (para. 6.04);
(1) make sufficient funds available for the operation of
the hotel training center (para. 6.04);
(m)  provide the necessary complementary financing for
hotel credit on terms and conditions suitable for
long-term hotel financing, should funds from other
channels fall short of requirements (para. 6.05);
(n) appoint a hotel adviser with qualifications and
experience satisfactory to the Bank within six
months of loan signing (para. 6.06);
(o) ensure that a minimum number of rooms (3,825)
will be in operation by 1989, provided that the
Government and the Bank agree that a potential
market for these rooms exists (para. 6.07);
(p) retain consultants acceptable to the Bank, within
twelve months of loan signing to prepare a market
strategy program for the project (para. 6.16);
(q) permit foreign charter operations to Antalya to
the extent required to make the project viable to
supplement THY's charter operation (para. 6.17);
(r) declare Antalya airport open for international
scheduled service and use best efforts to enter
into bilateral negotiations for reciprocal
landing rights with the major tourist-generating
countries (para. 6.17);
(s) prepare a statement of proposed financial policy,
the substance of which would be agreed during
negotiations, for discussion with the Bank, within



- 31 -
one year of loan signing. The policy would include
a list of objectives, the methodology for calculating
tariffs, selling prices and rental charges, as well
as procedures for their implementation (para. 7.12);
(t) agree to transfer PRD's responsibilities under the
project to its successor, on conditions acceptable
to the Bank (para. 7.13);
(u) establish a set of accounts for the project acceptable
to the Bank, to be maintained by PRD (para. 7.14); and
(v) submit financial statements audited by auditors ,
acceptable to the Bank, within four months of the
close of each fiscal year (para. 7.14).
10.02        The following would be conditions of effectiveness of the loan:
(a) initiation of expropriation procedures for the land
needed for development through 1981 and notification
to land owners that the Borrower will exercise its
preemptive rights to do so in accordance with Article
10 of the Land Office Law (No. 1164) (para. 3.09);

TURKEY: SOUTH ANTALYA TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT COMPONENTS  1/
A. Roads
1.          The existing road from Antalya City to Finike is currently the
only access to the project area. The road is paved as far as Kemer; from
there on it is of low standard. Existing access roads to the tourism develop-
ment sites at Kiziltepe, Tekerlektepe and Guneydeniz are in poor condition
and unstabilized.
2.          The General Directorate of Highways of the Ministry of Public
Works is currently carrying out a program to construct a new highway from
Antalya City to Finike.  Construction on  the new highway was started in 1969
and has been completed as far as the southern end of the Beldibi Tunnel.  Grad-
ing works have been completed as far as Kemer and are presently being carried
out on the road section between Kemer and Tekirova. The completion of the
section between Beldibi Tunnel and Tekirova (passing Guneydeniz and Phaselis)
is planned for early 1977.
3.          The project comprises the completion of the new Antalya City -
Finike Highway from the Beldibi Tunnel at km 26 to Tekirova at km 58; and
the provision of access roads to Kemer and to the tourism developments sites
at Kiziltepe, Tekerlektepe and Guneydeniz. The works would include completion
of the grading works and construction of several flood passages; completion
of the road surface between Beldibi and Tekirova, and complete construction
of the access roads.
4.          The Antalya City-Finike highway has been designed as an integral
part of the national highway system. The highway would have a 10 m platform
width, allowing for a design speed of 70 km/hour. The access roads platform
width would be 8 m, with a design speed of 30-50 km/hour. Both standards are
in conformity with the Turkish Highway Department's criteria. Safety pre-
cautions include lighting and traffic channelization at intersections, the
provision of passing lanes and comprehensive signing and striping.
5.          Planning, design and construction of the Antalya City-Finike
Highway is being carried out by the General Directorate of Highways (Ministry
of Public Works) which would also design and construct the access roads to
the tourism development sites. The Project Directorate would be in charge
of construction of streets in Kemer. Construction of on-site roads in
Kiziltepe, Tekerlektepe and Guneydeniz would be carried out by individual
investors.
1/ Roads, small craft harbor, telecommunications, Kemer infrastructure and
urban development, employee housing, national park, Phaselis archaeological
site; Annexes V, VI and VII deal with water supply and sewerage, electric
power and the hotel training center.



ANNEX IV
Page 2
B.  Small Craft Harbor
6.          The original plAn proVided for small craft harbor facilities
at each tourist development site. Thase facilities were designed to encourage
a lively interchange of sailing actiyities and aquatic sports between the four
major resort centers at Kiziltepe, Tekerlektepe, Kemer and Guneydeniz.  The
development of a multitude of harbors, however, proved to be uneconomical and
not justified by the projected demand. Consequently, it was decided to con-
centrate the harbor facilities in one location.
7.          Kemer was chosen as the most advantageous location for three
reasons: first, Kemer is the only site with. natural protection which would
minimize the construction of elaborate and expensive marine works such as
breakwaters, etc. Second, Kemer is located in the center of the project area
and within convenient cruising distance from the old Antalya port. And third,
the creation of a small craft harbor at Kemer would contribute substantially
to the development of Kemer as the center of urban tourist activities.
8.          The Kemer small craft harbor would eventually have a capacity of
120 boats with a first phase development under the project which would accom-
modate approximately 80 boats. The harbor basin would be protected by two
breakwaters leaving an entrance wide enough to allow safe and convenient passage
for boats up to 40 m. Navigation aids would include buoys, markers and navi-
gation lights. The waterside installations would also include a marine service
station which would be located near the harbor entrance.
9.          Landside facilities would include dry boat storage, boat handling
facilities, a marine supply store, public restrooms and showers, automobile
and trailer parking areas, a restaurant and administrative offices. The dry
boat storage area would be combined with the boat repair facilities and would
be extended during the winter months to include some of the automobile and
trailer parking areas. Public restrooms and showers would be provided along
the berthing facilities at maximum intervals of 200 m. While many boats have
such facilities, their use would be prohibited in the harbor. A restaurant,
marine supply store and administrative 2ffices would be combined in one
building complex of approximately 650 m    Boat handling facilities would
include a launching ramp and derrick, as well as monorail crane lifts.
Utilities and services to be provided at Kemer Harbor would include a water
supply system, a sanitary sewer collection system, storm water drainage,
electric power supply, including water front lighting and telephone services.
10.         All major infrastructure works would be carried out by the General
Directorate of R,ailroads, Harbors and Airports of the Ministry of Public w'orks.
These works, would include the construction of main and secondary breakwaters,
berthing facilities, piers, launching ramp monorail crane lift basin, boat
repair facilities and the marine service station. All other works, including
open air and covered boat storage area, equipment-cranes, monorail crane lifts,
buildings, berthing equipment, navigation aids, waterfront lighting and
utility connections would be the responsibility of PRD.



ANNFY IV

C. Telecommunications
11.         The project would include the construction of a local telephone
network and an exchange plant, upgrading of the existing Antalya exchange,
the provision of a telex and multiplex system, and a radio link between
Kemer and Antalya.
12.         The 45 km underground telephone network would serve Beldibi and
the tourism development sites at Kiziltepe, Tekerlektepe, Kemer and Guneydeniz.
A microwave relay station to be located north of Kemer would connect the network
by a 300 channel radio-link to the existing exchange in Antalya. The Antalya
exchange is currently being integrated into the national microwave communi-
cations system, and a submarine cable will link Antalya to Italy by 1977.
13.         The new Kemer exchange would have a capacity of 500 lines, with 8
register meters, 14 internal distribution circuits, 75 outgoing line circuits,
20 incoming line circuits and 5 two phase circuits. The telex system would be
connected by radio-link to the Antalya exchange and would include 40 telex
machines to be leased to consumers.
14.         The coimmunications component would be implemented and operated by
the Turkish PTT.
D. Kemer Infrastructure and Urban Development
15.         Kemer, located approximately 42 km from Antalya City, is the only
major rural settlement (pop. 700) in the project area. Surrounded by fertile
flat lands and pine tree covered hills, the settlement spreads in a loose
pattern along the old Antalya City-Finike highway, with some higher density
areas at the crossing with the Aslanbucak-Kucukburun Road. The present economic
structure of Kemer is based on agriculture. Most of the plains surrounding
Kemer are covered with citrus gardens and vegetable fields. The number of
greenhouses, where a large variety of vegetables and fruits are grown for ex-
port to other parts of Turkey, is increasing rapidly. Commercial activities
are limited to a number of small shops and establishments, including 2 res-
taurants, 5 coffeehouses, a bakery, 8 grocery stores, a giftshop, a barbershop
and a cinema. Educational and health facilities in Kemer serve an area with
a population of about 3,000 and include a primary school for 130 students, a
new secondary school which opened in late 1975 and a mother and child health
center. Small industries are limited to a pit sawyer enterprise and a lathe
operation. The only tourist establishment of some significance is the nearby
Valtur Vacation 'Village, wlth a present room capacity of 350 and extension
plans for an additional 350 rooms.  Two other small pension-type establishments
with a combined capacity of 38 beds are located along the existing Antalya City-
Finike highway.
16.         The Kemer urban development zone is delineated by the historical
site of Idyros to the east, Valtur Vacation Village and agricultural land
to the south, the settlement of Kulmudere to the north and a forest-zoned area
to the west.  The total urban development zone is 26 ha in size and is proposed
to be subdivided into residential, commercial and recreational development areas.



ANNEX IV
Page 4
In addition, two areas would be set apart for tourism development: the
urban tourism deyelopment area (5 ha), located adjacent to the small craft
harbor, and the non-urban tourism deyelopment area (15 ha), located on a
beach approximately 1 kim north of Kemer. The area adjacent to the small
craft harbor would be developed prior to 1981, while the non-urban area is
scheduled for development between 1982 and 1987.
17.         The two tourism development areas would have a total capacity of
2,400 rooms, including the expanded 700-room Valtur Vacation Village. 780
rooms (including the practice hotel) would be located in the upper floors of
the buildings in the urban tourism development area, while the ground floors
would be occupied by shops and restaurants. The atmosphere to be created
in this area would be entirely different from the low density, beach oriented
developments elsewhere in the project area: it is envisaged that the Kemer
urban tourism development area would be comparable in character to a typical
Mediterranean coastal village, with its pedestrian oriented streets and malls,
shops, outdoor cafes, intimate plazas, a multitude of human activities and a
lively mix of local people and visitors. To encourage the local population
to participate in the tourist activities in Kemer, three nearby beaches would
be developed for day users.
18.         The existing commercial area at the junction of the Antalya City-
Kemer and Kemer-Kucukburun roads would be expanded to accommodate additional
shops for local use, while new residential areas are planned along the Antalya
City-Finike road and to the west of the urban tourism development area. The
latter would have a relatively high density to create an urban atmosphere,
while the developments along the road would be of a low density and rural in
character. Projections for Kemer foresee a total permanent population of 7000
by 1990.
19.         Parks, playgrounds and sports facilities would be developed at
several locations throughout Kemer. Near the future entrance to the town,
small industries and storage facilities would be located. An administration
building, a bus terminal and a health clinic would be provided near the future
center of Kemer.
20.         The proposed Kemer infrastructure and urban improvement component
would provide for streets, parking areas, stormwater drainage, connections to
the project area's water supply and sewerage systems, and an electricity dis-
tribution network. In addition, sports facilities, parks, playgrounds and the
development of 2 day-use beaches are included in the project. Superstructure
developments would comprise a bus terminal, buildings for small industrial
enterprises including handicrafts and a health. clinic. The health clinic
would be provided by the Ministry of Health and would be a standard prototype
designed to serve siall communities throughout Turkey. The clinic would be
approximately 360 m in  size and fully equipped and furnished, including a
jeep ambulance. The staff would comprise three doctors, two nurses, three
midwives and four medical aides.



ANNEX IV
Page 5
21.         Responsibility for planning, design and implementation of the
Kemer infrastructure and urban improvement project would rest with the PRD
which would be assisted by the various ministries and agencies that are
involved in the Kemer development. The PRD would also be responsible for
the maintenance and operation of the elements of this project component,
until the establishment of the municipality of Kemer.
E. Employee housing
22.         By 1981, approximately 2,200 persons would be employed by the
hotels in Kiziltepe, Tekerlektepe, Kemer and Guneydeniz. On the basis of
demographic characteristics and the past growth pattern of the local popula-
tion it has been assumed that most of the hotel employees would come from
existing settlements within or near the project area or would commute from
Antalya. About one-third,however, would migrate from other parts of Turkey
and would be in need of housing.
23.         To avoid uncontrolled housing developments and overcrowding of
existing residential settlements, the construction of 280 low-cost houses
has been included in the project. The houses would be located in Kemer and
would house approximately 1,400 persons, of which 700 would be directly
employed in the hotel industry. Grouped in clu sters of 6-8 dwellings, the
houses would be two stories high, with 60-100 m of living space. Allowing
for schools, streets and open spaces, about 25 homes (for 125 persons) would
be built per ha.
24.         The 280 homes would be constructed over a 4-year period by the
PRD. After completion, the homes would be rented to private hotel operators
who, in turn, would make them available to their employees. New homes would
only be constructed after rental arrangements with private hotel operators
have been secured.
25.         In order to accommodate one-third of all hotel employees (about
5,000 by 1990) some 1,000 houses would be needed. The 280 homes built under
the project, to cope with the needs up to 1981, are only a first step and
meant to serve as an example of how further employee housing could be provided.
The employee houses under the project would be built by the PRD in cooperation
with the Ministry of Reconstruction and Development and rented to hotel operators
for their employees.
F. National Park
26.         Most of the mountainous and wooded zones of the project area would
be located within the boundaries of a major National Park. With its many scenic
spots and rich variety of wildlife and vegetation, the park is expected to
attract visitors on a year round basis.
27.         The National Park. component includes the provision of a day visitor
beach., the development of three camping sites, reforestation, construction of
135km of forest and mountain trails, and highway beautification. The day visitor



ANNEX IV
Page 6
beach. will be located at Kiris and would have a visitor capacity of 2,500.
Campgrounds will be provided at Dedelar (300 tents), Kiris (480 tents), and
Guneydeniz (120 tents). The day visitor beach and campsites would be cleared,
landscaped, and provided with access roads, electric power, and centrally
located restrooms and showers. The campsites would, in addition, have central
cooking facilities, and snackbars would be provided in Dedelar and Kiris. The
highway beautification program would include landscaping and the creation of
scenic lookout points and rest areas. For the National Park administration,
an office building combined with a visitor center would be provided in Kemer.
The component also includes the provision of two motorboats, two helicopters
with firefighting equipment, a fire station, several fire control towers and
a wireless communication system.
28.         The National Park component will be executed and administered by
the Department of National Parks of the Ministry of Forestry.
G. Phaselis Archaeological Site
29.         Three historic cities are located in the project area:  Phaselis,
which was established as a colony of the Kingdom of Rhodes in the 7th Century
B.C.; Olympus, first recorded in history in the 2nd Century B.C.; and Idyros,
a late Roman early Byzantine development near the present settlement of Kemer.
Of the three cities, only Phaselis is of historic interest to tourists.
30.         Located approximately 10 km south of Kemer, the ancient city of
Phaselis was a trading center with a harbor of some importance. Several harbor.
developments constructed over the years can still be observed, the oldest one
now being located far inland. Despite being overgrown by rich vegetation, the
main street of Phaselis does not fail to impress the visitor: beginning at
the harbor, the street leads to a hilltop which offers a magnificent view of
the ocean. The buildings along the street are of substantial architectural
value, and the Phaselis Amphitheater, though small, is superbly proportioned.
Once restored and cleared of overgrown vegetation, Phaselis will be a major
asset to the project area.
31.         The project comprises clearing, excavation, provision of an access
road and utility connections, construction of a landing pier for excursion boats
and some buildings, including an exhibition hall. Security fences would be
erected where necessary. In addition, a conservation study, an underwater
archaeological survey and a vehicle for the archaeological team would be fin-
anced under the project.
32.         The project would be executed and administered by the General
Directorate of Ancient Monuments and Museums of the Ministry of Culture. During
execution, the Ministry would be assisted by archaeological consultants. UNESCO
has expressed interest in the restoration of Phaselis.

TURKEY: SOUTH ANTALYA TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE
Scope of the Component
1.          There are at present no public water supply or sewerage
facilities in the project area although certain private enterprises tap
the groundwater resources in the immediate vicinity and the one established
hotel operation, Valtur, has its own sewage treatment plan. The provision
of uninterrupted supplies, of potable water and effective sewage collection
and treatment are essential to the success of the project. After a gradual
build-up of both touristic and resident populations, there will be 4,825
hotel rooms by 1986 and a peak seasonal population outside the hotels of
over 15,000, including permanent residents, campers and day beach users.
2.          Under the project water supply and sewer systems sufficient to
meet the needs of the area's 1986 population would be built.  However, in
order to achieve appropriate construction cost economics, the 1990 population
levels are taken as a norm for determining peak, seasonal and off-season flow
requirements. The MTI employed individual consultants to carry out the re-
levant studies in order to identify water supply and sewage treatment systems
which would be appropriate to the area.
Description of the Project
(i) Water Supply
3.          The consultants reviewed alternative methods of providing an
adequate water source and decided to adopt a combination of a mountain spring
with a well complex, as a back-up system during the peak season.
4.          The water supply project comprises:
(a) an intake at Guverte Spring, located 480 meters above
sea level and some 9 km inland;
(b) a complex of five 100-meter deep wells at Asagi Kuzdere,
some 2 km inland from Kemer;
(c)  a 14-km4 transmission main with 3 pressure breaking
chambers from Guverte Spring to the Goynuk reservoirs;
(d)  a 2-km force main from the wellheads to the Kemer reservoir;
(e) reservoirs, with chlorination facilities at Kemer (3,000 m3 )
to serve the Kemer urban and resort areas and the Guneydeniz
resort area, and at Goynuk (1,876 m3 ) to serve the Kiziltepe
and Tekerlektepe resort areas;
(f) 33-km of trunk mains and local distribution networks.



ANNEX V
Page 2
While the project does not provide for water supply to the various rural
communities situated within the project area, the design of the trans-
mission mains allows the subsequent extension of water supply services to
these rural communities.
(ii) Sewerage
5.          The consultants also reviewed alternative methods of sewage
treatment and finally opted for mechanically aerated facultative ponds.
This method of treatment seems best suited due to its simplicity of oper-
ation, and to the favorable climatic conditions during peak load periods.
6.          The sewer systems were designed assuming sewage flows equal to
90% of the projected water consumption plus infiltration at a rate of
0.1 1/sec/developed hectare. The ponds were sized for a minimum detention
period of eight days at peak season load and the raw sewage aeration equip-
ment for a raw sewage BOD concentration of 250 mg/liter. Considering the
high temperatures prevalent during the summer it is estimated that a minimum
80% removal of BOD and suspended solids should be achieved. The treated
effluent, after chlorination, will be used for agricultural irrigation or
alternatively discharged into natural water courses. It is believed that this
method, together with the secluded siting of treatment ponds, will prevent
any endangerment of environmental values.
7.          The sewage collection and treatment project comprises:
(a) three separate collection networks with:
Kemer/      Kiziltepe/
Guneydeniz      Camyuva     Tekerlektepe

(b) mechanically aerated ponds (3 meters deep with 1 meter levee)
for raw sewage treatment at Guneydeniz (1,800 m3 peak daily
load), at Kiziltepe (4,238 m3 peak daily load and near
Kemer (4,400 m3 pepai'l daily load);
(c)  for each aerated pond, a set of floating mechanical aerators
mounted on pontoons and electrically powered as well as
facilities for raw sewage screening, post chlorination and
effluent outfall.
8.          The estimated capital costs of providing the water supply and
sewerage system amount to TL 100.2 million (Annex II, Tables 5 and 6). These
estimates are based on preliminary designs prepared by consultants and with

the exception of cast iron pipes, on 1975 cost standards prepared by the
Ministry of Public Works and updated to December 1975 prices. The costs
used for cast iron pipes have been set at the same level as for the Bank's
Istanbul sewerage project on the assumption that these pipes will be im-
ported. The cost estimates do not include local networks within the
resort sites, which are the responsibility   of the investors, nor do they
include the cost of irrigation network using treated effluent.
9.          The MTI would assume responsibility for the execution of the water
supply and sewerage components.       PRD would initially be responsible for
the operation and maintenance of the systems. After the creation of a Muni-
cipality at Kemer, all the assets and liabilities would be transferred to
this authority which would also assume responsibility for accounting, operation
and maintenance of the systems.
Financial Results
10.         The level at which combined water and sewerage charges are to be
set will be critical to the viability of the operation. There are at present
no comparable services for resort areas in Turkey and accordingly the lines
on which the tariff used for the financial analysis, has been computed are
somewhat arbitrary. On the assumption that the hotel operations should bear
a 25% higher charge than cther consumers and that a reasonable level of tariffs
to other consumers for a combined water and sewerage service should be TL 4.00
(at 1975 prices) per cubic meter of water supplied, the rate of return on net
plant in operation rises from 0.1% in 1981 to 5.7% in 1986.
11.         The rate of return on services to hotels only (based on a cost
apportionment related to demand) has been calculated at 6.6% in 1986 rising
to in excess of 8% by 1990. The rate of return on services to the permanent
population would in the long term be at a level of about 4%. Despite the
relatively low overall rate of return, an adequate level of debt service cover-
age can be achieved by 1984. The DCF rate of return is 8.7%.
AssumDtions for Financial Tables
(i) Income Statement
12.         Water demand and supply is based on the following standards:
Peak day consumption (liters):
Hotels class A/DL              1900  l/occupied room
if     B                1520  1/occupied room
if     C                1235  1/occupied room
rf     VV               1235  1/occupied room
Campings                        200  1/camper night
Summer villas                   240  1/occupant
Day beaches                      40  1/visitor
Permanent population            130  1/head (including
institutional,
commercial and
'Idustrial use.)



ANNEX V
Page 4
All the above norms, with the exception of those for the
permanent population, haye been applied at 95% of physical capacities.
Average seasonal daily consumption: at 100% of peak day
consumption for permanent residents, 75% for hotels, 60% for campers and
50% for day beach users.
Off-season daily consumption: at 100% of peak day consumption
for permanent residents, 14% for hotels and campsites and 10% for day beach
facilities.
Annual demand and supply: annual demand is based on average
seasonal daily consumption x 210 days plus the average off-season daily
consumption x 155 days. Annual supply is taken at 115% of annual demand to
take account of system losses.
13.         The combined water and sewerage tariff is based on a price (1975
level) of TL 5.00 per cubic meter of water supplied to hotels and TL 4.00
for other consumers. For forecasting purposes, it has been assumed that this
tariff will be subjected to a compound inflation rate of 10% per annum over
the forecast period giving tariffs of:
1979    1980    1981    1982    1983    1984    1985    1986
( TL per 'm )
Hotels      7.31    8.04    8.84    9.72    10.69   11.76   12.94   14.23
Others      5.85    6.43    7.07    7.78       8.55    9.41   10.35   11.38
No provision has been made for possible revenues from the sale of treated
sewage effluent for irrigation purposes.
14.         Operating costs have been set on the following assumptions:
Salaries:  at planned establishment levels and 1975
base costs subjected at 10% inflation per annum.  For 1979, it is assumed
that only  75% of the total staff establishment will be reauired.
3           rChemicals;  at average chlorine application levels of
5 mgm/m 3 for water supplied and at 8 mgm/m3 for sewage treated and at 1975
prices inflated by 10% per annum.
Power costs: on the. installed capacity of wellhead punps,
pumping stations and aerators at assumed levels of operation in accordance
with the electricity tariffs set out in Annex VI.
Maintenance costs: at 1.1/2% per annum of the net value
of plant in operation.
Administrative expenses: at 20% of salary costs.
Bad debts: at 1% of gross revenue.



ANNEX V
Page 5
Depreciation: at an average annual rate of 3.5% of
gross value of plant in oper4tion.
(ii)  Funds Flow Statement
15.         Borrowings have been taken at the foreign exchange component of
total project costs or TL 35 million plus interest during construction of
TL 7.4 million assuming a Government loan for 20 years, including 5 years
grace, and 8.5% interest rate.
16.         Government equity contribution has been set at the local currency
component of total project cost plus additional working capital requirements
during 1980/81 to maintain the net current assets position at a minimum level
of 30% of annual revenue. This high initial working capital will be required
due to the necessity of starting metering and connecting equipment prior to
sales to customers.
(iii) Balance Sheet
17.         Fixed assets have been revalued at 10% per annum.  Capital ex-
penditure after project execution, has been limited to 3% of the gross value
of plant in operation from 1983 onwards, when the working capital has reached
an adequate and self-sustaining level.

TURKEY: SOUTH ANTALYA TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
ELECTRIC POWER
Scope of the Project
1.          The electricity supply facilities, which are to be provided
as part of the proposed project, would meet the power demands of the hotels,
and camping sites, as well as of the permanent population residing in Kemer.
These facilities would also serve the water supply and sewerage systems and
other public services in Kemer. In addition the planned network would also
cover certain communities situated close to the main distribution network.
2.          Kepez, A.S., a private company established in 1955 under
Law No. 4/5143, holds the exclusive right to distribute electrical power
for public use in the Province of Antalya for a term of 50 years. Kepez
purchases a certain amount of energy from Turkiye Elektrik Kurumn (TEK)
off the 154 kV national grid system which connects with the Kepez network
at the Kepez central hydroelectric station situation some 5 km west of
Antalya. The Kepez distribution network comprises a 31.5 kV system linking
its hydroelectric station with Antalya, Manavgat and Alanya. Local low
voltage distribution networks within towns and villages do not fall within
the Kepez sphere of operations.
3.          The existing generating capacity of Kepez is 61 mw and the
potential annual maximum supply level, assuming an approximate 60% load
factor is 313.2 million kilowatt hours. The 1974 annual report forecasts
an increase in installed capacity to 166 mw by 1977 and 263 mw by 1982.
4.          Kepez, like several Turkish private societies, distributes a
high proportion of its post tax profits (78% in 1974) after making certain
specific reserve allocations. This results in low retained profit levels,
insufficient to finance major extensions of the generating capacity or
distribution network. Annual profit levels appear somewhat distorted too
because of the lack of adequate financial cut-offs and the underevaluation
(in replacement cost terms) of plant in operation, giving inflated rates
of return (Table 1). Net losses and profits have accordingly been adjusted
to reflect a normalized profit position for 1974 and to revalue the plant
assets at the end of 1974. (Unadjusted figures are also shown for com-
parative purposes in this table).
Description of the Project
5.          The project covers the extension of the 154 kV grid line from
the Kepez hydroelectric station to Kemer, where a substation will reduce
voltage to 31.5 kV for distribution to Beldibi in the north, Kemer itself
and Tekirova in the south, together with the planned tourist sites along



ANNEX VI
Page 2
the coast. Outside the project future plans call for the upgrading of the
medium voltage distribution network from single to double circuit and for
the extension of the 154 kV and 31.5 kV lines south to Kumluca and Finike.
6.          The electricity supply component comprises:
(a) 39.2 km of 154 kV transmission line from Kepez
hydroelectric station to Kemer on pylons with
chain isolators;
(b) a 154 31.5 kV substation at Kemer;
(c) 15 km of 31.5 kV overhead distribution line
(single circuit) running north from the Kemer
substation to Beldibi, with branch lines to
Tekerlektepe and Kiziltepe, the sewerage treatment
plant and various pumping stations, day use
beaches and camping sites in the vicinity;
(d) 2 km of 31.5 kV feeder line from the Kemer
substation to the Kemer urban and resort area,
treatment plant and pumping stations;
(e) 20 km of 31.5 kV overhead distribution line
(single circuit) running south from the Kemer
substation to Tekirova, with branch lines to
Guneydeniz and Phaselis as well as to the
waterwells, camping sites, day beaches, sewerage
treatment plant and pumping stations in the
vicinity; and
(f) a standby supply system.
The costs of local transformer stations and secondary distribution networks
within the development sites are not included as they are the responsibility
of the public and private investors. Whenever possible the low voltage
distribution networks will be underground in order to protect the environment.
7.          The single circuit 31.5 kV distribution system will be adequate
up to the early 1990s, when a second circuit will be added as the further
development of hotel accommodations and rural population demand increases
the peak load beyond the existing capacity. Kepez forecasts for 1995, a
peak hourly load of 33054 kVa.
8.          It is estimated (Annex II, Table 8) that the total cost of the
electricity supply component will be TL 63.2 million, of which TL 38.5 million
(61%) is of foreign exchange.  These estimates are based on Kepez calculations
updated to December 1975 prices. The cost estimates for the emergency power
supply system are excluded from the following calculations regarding Kepez as
the emergency system will not be provided by Kepez, but by the MTI.



ANNEX VI
Page 3
9.          Kepez would be responsible for the operation and maintenance of
the system and would separately bill all major hotel operations on a
commercial tariff basis. Electricity supplies to other consumers would be
"block billed" to the PRD (Municipality of Kemer) or the appropriate village
councils and government agencies.
Financial Results
10.         It is estimated that by 1983, the tourism project will only
account for some 7% of the total Kepez energy sales and accordingly the
projected rates of return largely reflect the overall viability of Kepez
rather than the rate of return on the project investment. After allowing
for the revaluation of the 1974 fixed assets, the return on average plant in
operation falls from a level of 14.2% in 1975 to 6.6% in 1979, but then
rises to 9.4% by 1983 when a significant number of hotels have come on
stream. The debt service coverage, which is based on a government loan at
commercial terms to finance the foreign exchange element of the project cost,
remains satisfactory throughout the forecast period.
11.         The financial projections suggest that Kepez has the resources
to finance internally the local costs of the project as well as interest
during construction, albeit at the probable cost of deferring other major
developments until 1981. This ability to provide a substantial proportion
of the project financing is also dependent upon Kepez limiting the level of
profit distribution, which for forecasting purposes has been set at 50% of
post tax profits.
Assumptions for Financial Projections
(i) Forecast of Energy Consumption and Supply (peak hours)
12.         The following consumption norms have been set:
Hotels, class A/DL            2.6 kw per (95% occupancy) room
"   B              2.0 kw                t "     i
"   C              1.8 kw  "                     it
It  Wv             1.8 kw  "    "       " 
Seasonal hotel staff - 0.12 kw
Summer villa occupants, campers and urban population - 0.12 kw
Rural population - 0.12 kw x 50% of the total population
Water and sewerage systems - based on installed capacity
at assumed operational levels
Public buildings, Kemer small harbor, street lighting,
commerce and industry - at lump sum estimates
In-season consumption: At peak hours x 10 for daily consumption
x 210 days x occupancy levels of 75% for hotels, 60% for summer residents
and camping sites, 100% for permanent population and 90% for other consumers.



ANNEX VI
Page 4
Off-season consumption: At peak hours x 10 for daily consump-
tion x 155 days x utilization rates of 100% for permanent population and
50% for non-touristic facilities.
Existing network customers: At nil growth on 1974 actual demand
levels up to 1979 and thereafter at 5% compound growth per annum. This
conservative basis has been adopted because of the static demand between
1972 and 1974 and because of financial limitations on extending or improving
the existing network before 1981 (para. 11).
Energy losses:  At 5% for distribution and 5% for transmission.
Energy purchased from TEK: 100% of the tourism project require-
ment, which will be met from an extension of the 154 kV TEK national grid
and at the 1974 TEK proportion of total energy requirement for the existing
network reduced by 1% per annum.
(ii) Profit and Loss Account
13.         The electricity tariff for the tourism project is based on the
average 1975 tariffs of Kepez: 35.50 kurus/kwh for new commercial users
(including directly billed hotels) and at 41.00 kurus/kwh for other
consumers billed through local authorities. In order to provide a premium
cost for hotel operators, commercial rates have been inflated by 10% per
annum over the forecast period whereas the rates for other consumers within
the project zone have been inflated at only 5% per annum. This implies
that by the start of project operations, the hotels will be subsidizing
the other project zone consumers. The tariff for the existing network
customers is based on the 1974 average unit selling prices subjected to a
10% annual inflation rate.  This compares with a 50% unit price increase
between 1972 and 1974.
14.         Operating expenses have been estimated on the following basis:
Energy purchased: At the 1975 TEK tariff rates to Kepez with
10% inflation per annum.
Management and operating expenses: At the 1974 levels inflated
by 10% per annum.
Maintenance expenses: At 4% of gross revenue.
Purchase/sales tax: At 2% of gross revenue to take account
of the fact that sales tax is only assessed on direct billing of commercial
customers.
Net commission, indemnities and bad debts: at 5% of gross
revenue.



ANNEX VI
Page 5
Depreciation; at an average rate of 5% per annum of the gross
value of plant in operation.
15.         Of the non-operating profit and loss transactions, interest and
participation profits have been kept constant at their 1974 level; mis-
cellaneous income has been inflated by 10% and loan interest payable has
been taken at 13% on a reducing balance basis, assuming equal annual year-
end repayments. Taxation has been taken at its 1974 percentage rate of
37% of profit before tax but after interest.
(iii) Funds Flow Statement & Balance Sheet
16.         The increase in deferred liabilities is based on the net movement
in the value of tax liabilities and profit distributions. The Government
loan is based on financing the 61% foreign exchange element of project cost.
17.         Non-project capital expenditure is based on available cash surpluses
after financing the local currency element of the project costs, interest during
construction, subsequent debt servicing and a 10% annual inflation of working
capital requirements.
18.         Debt servicing has been based on an assumed Government loan of
TL 38.5 million over a 10 year period, including a three year grace period,
with interest at 13% on the reducing balance.
19.         Gross plant in operation has been revalued at 10% per annum from
1975 onwards.

TURKEY: SOUTH ANTALYA TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
HOTEL TRAINING CENTER
Present System
1.          In Turkey, hotel training is the joint responsibility of the
j'jinistries of Tourism and Information and of National Education. The MTI's
Department of Vocational Education runs hotel training programs in training
centers (OTEM): practical experience is gained in hotels owned by the Tourism
Bank. There are presently 4 such. programs in Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir and
Antalya, with a fifth project proposed for Urgup in 1976. Each course consists
of about 100 students and the program lasts for eight months (4 months class-
room work and 4 months practical training in the hotels). Courses include
reception, restaurant and bar service, housekeeping and kitchen. The first
three courses are open to secondary school graduates and the kitchen specialty
is open to primary school graduates. Female students (age 18-22) and male
students (age 14-18) are accepted in the first three specialties, while the
kitchen specialty is limited to boys (age 14-16). This program has been in
existence since 1967 and has trained about 2,200 students. In addition, about
10,000 employees have received 15-30 days on-the-job training since the program
was instituted.
2.          The OTEM centers have succeeded in training a good many students,
most of whom would otherwise be unemployed. This has been achieved under some-
what adverse conditions - buildings are badly designed, there is very little
equipment and budgets are quite limited. In this sense, the training center
under the project will act as a "model" for the whole country.
3.          The Ministry of National Education shares responsibility with the
Ministry of Tourism and Information for the OTEM program, but in practice, its
interest is limited to professional education in technical high schools (lycees
hoteliers). Presently there are 3 technical high schools in Ankara (400 students),
in Istanbul (550 students) and in Kusadasi (150 students).   A fourth school is
planned for Antalya (500 students) in 1976. After completion of secondary school,
students can enroll in a three-year training program which results in the baccalaureate
for hotel and tourism studies. Upon graduation, students can expect to find
jobs leading after a few years? experience to middle management positions such
as that of front office manager in a hotel.  The total number of students
trained under this program since its inception in 1964 is about 2,000.  The
Ministry of National Education also provides minimal instruction in tourism in
primary and secondary schDols, under the social science program.
4.          The INE schools are well organized, well equipped and staffed and
provide a well rounded professional training in all trade aspects of lodging
and food service management.

Kemer THotel Training Center
5.          The project calls for some 6,000 rooms. over a 10-year period,
which implies a total of 5,400 staff to be trained (staff/room ratio: 0.9:1),
or 540 staff per year on average. The proposed Kemer training center will
have an output of 375 students per year.  However, because of the phasing of
the accommodation build-up, the school will not be able to train the necessary
number of students in the early years of the project's life. There will be
a backlog of untrained personnel for about 5 years. The center will serve
only the project area during its first years of operation anld will take on a
broader regional role in later years. The hotel training center in Kemer,
which trains entry level staff, will not duplicate the training in the pro-
posed technical high school in Antalya, which is designed to train middle
level managers.
6.          The project would consist of a training school, a 48-room practice
hotel and a dormitory for 240 students. The plans for the new training school
call for four classrooms, five laboratories (i.e., restaurant/bar, housekeeping,
reception, language and typing/stenography), a multi-purpose restaurant, a
restaurant, a demonstration kitchen, a library, a sick ward, meeting and
administration rooms and the necessary supplies. The practice hotel would
have 48 double guest rooms, a restaurant comprising dining room, snack bar and
bar, kitchen, reception area with adjacent front office, lobby and lounge area
and storage and supply rooms. The dormitory would house 240 students and would
include 36 bedrooms; for males, 12 for females and 3 for supervisors.
7.          The construction of the hotel training center would be carried out
by the PRD. Upon completion, the school would be operated by the MTI's Depart-.
ment of Vocational Education.
Technical Assistance
8.          Technical assistance for hotel training under the project would
provide for: (i) a consultant for 3 months to assist the MTI in the design
and layout of the school, the preparation of equipment lists, and the selection
of the hotel school teachers; and (ii) six expatriate experts for a total of
126 man months, over a two and a half year period, as follows:
1 training director               30 man months
1 kitchen expert                  24    "
1 restaurant/bar expert           18
1 reception expert                18
1 housekeeper expert              12
1 accountancy expert              12

The training director would be recruited one year before and the others
three months. before the school is scheduled to open.  1/
Financial Aspects
9.          The projected operating budget, together with a summary income
statement for the practice hotel, is given in Table 1. The practice hotel
would operate year-round but,probably at a low annual occupancy rate. The
operating profit of the hotel covers about 28% of the hotel training center's
projected operating cost. The balance would have to be met from the MTI
annual budget.
1!  The estimated cost of the technical assistance is TL 5.70 million
(US$0.38 million).

ACCOMMODATION DEVELOPMENT
Introduction
1.          The proposed development and the phasing of hotels is given in
Table 1.  A total of 5,750 rooms would be opened over a 12-year period.  The
distribution of hotels by category would be as follows:
Luxury             16%
"B" class          34%
"C" class          19%
Vacation village  31%
100%
There is presently one vacation village with 350 rooms (Valtur) operating
in the project area; an expansion with another 350 rooms is planned for 1978.
Construction Costs
2.          In recent years, hotel construction costs have increased at an
annual rate of 20% but stabilized in 1975. The following are the average
construction costs (without land) based on Tourism Bank data for hotels
completed in 1974.
TL 'OOOs per room      US$ '000s per room
"A" class                    210                      14.0
"B" class                    170                      11.3
"C" class                    140                       9.3
"D" class                    100                       6.6
Vacation village             132                       8.8
Average                 150                     10.0
The Antalya Hotel (deluxe category) in Antalya City was completed in 1975 at
a turnkey cost of about US$20,000 per room. The foreign exchange component
of hotels is estimated at 20-25% of total cost. Based on the proposed buildup
of accommodation for the South Antalya project, the average construction cost
per room in 1975 prices is assumed to be TL 220,000 (US$14,750).

Overall Hotel Analysis
3.          Antalya is situated relatively far south and has a long season.
For purposes of the projections, a season of 210 days has been assumed with
an occupancy distribution of 90% in the peak months of July and August and
60-80% in the shoulder months. For individual hotels, seasonal room occupancies
are forecast at 45% in the first year of operation, rising to 75% in the
fourth year of operation. This results in an overall seasonal room occupancy
curve for the 5,750 rooms of 45% in the first year of operation, rising to
73% by the 12th year. 1/ Since most of the clientele is expected to be group/
charter or families, a ratio of 1.9 persons per room has been used.
4.          Statements of income and expense (Table 2) have been prepared
following the U.S. Uniform System of Accounts for Hotels. Rates are based
on published hotel tariffs and experience in existing hotels in Turkey and
assume that all guests would stay on a Modified American Plan (MAP) or half
pension. Allowances were made for a modest number of meals in addition to
the half pension, and beverage, gift shop and other sales (telephone, laundry)
were calculated on a per guestnight basis. Average daily guest expenditures
in hotels have been calculated as follows:
Vacation
"A" Class     "B" Class      "C" Class       Village
Room (TL)                 165            112             90           115
Meals                     112            105             75            105
Drinks                     27             22             13            22
Other                      14             14              9          114
Total (TL)             318            253           187            256
Total (US$)          21.87          16.87         12.47          17.07
These expenditures are net of commissions and 10% hotel sales tax.
5.          Costs of sales are estimated as follows:  food costs at 35% of
food revenue and beverage costs at 32% of beverage sales. Payroll calculation
was based on staff schedules costed at average hotel salaries, an overall
room-to-staff ratio of 1:0.87 and a payroll cost equivalent of about 25% of
total revenue in a typical year of operation. The category of "other direct
expenses" includes cleaning supplies, replacement of china, glassware, linens,
etc.. The undistributed expense categories were calculated according to
ratios based on experience in the area. Service charges, for solid waste
disposal and upkeep of common facilities, have been calculated at TL 1,000 per
1/  On an annual basis, room occupancy would be about 45% when the project
reaches full operating capacity.

room per year. Ground rent was set at TL 1,000 per room per year for 80% of
capacity which is expected to be on rented land, based on the Ministries of
Forestry and Finance estimates of 0.6% of project cost.
6.          On these assumptions, the hotels attain a steady gross operating
profit of 32% of sales. Assuming management by the owners, the internal rate
of return for hotels is 9.7%; the rate of return is sensitive to investment
cost, occupancy and operating costs and to the type of management. The rates
of return resulting from variations in the basic assumptions are shown below:
Rate of Return (%)
Best estimates:
Owner managed                       9.7
Management contract                 7.8
Gross operating profit 1/
+ 10%                              11.5
- 10%                              8.15
Investment cost + 10%                   8.25
Individual Hotel Investments
7.          In order to evaluate a single hotel as an investment opportunity,
financial projections were made for a vacation village typical of the type
that is projected for South Antalya.. The projections, assumptions and rates
of return are given in Tables 3, 4, and 5.
8.          The vacation village generates a gross operating profit of 32% of
total revenues and yields an internal rate of return of 10.8% in constant
1975 prices. Debt service is adequate throughout the life of the long-term
debt associated with the project, the debt service coverage ratio reaching
1.8 in the third year of operation. A short-term loan will be necessary in
the first two years of operation to cover cash shortfalls. The project could
pay dividends of at least 10% from the fourth year of operation and the
internal rate of return on equity is 13.3%.
9.          These results are based on direct management by the owners.  Should
a management company be retained, the fees would be about 5-7% of total revenue
which would, in effect, reduce GOPs and cash flow by 15-20%. Under these
conditions, the internal rate of return drops to 8.8% and debt service
coverage drops to 1.5, which is still considered adequate.
10.         Hotel investments in South Antalya provide reasonable rates of
return and should be attractive to investors. Apart from the political climate
(and type of management, mentioned above), market conditions prevailing at the
time the decisions to construct hotels have to be taken, are likely to influence
investors' interest. Tariffs in the hotels will depend very much on market
conditions in Western Europe and also on tour operators' perceptions of the
project.

THE MARKET
The Mediterranean Market
1.          A recent draft Battelle 1' study commissioned by the Bank for
the Mediterranean Development Finance Companies (DFCs) expresses optimism
for the future of Mediterranean tourism. In the Mediterranean, total tourist
arrivals doubled between 1965 and 1973 to 50 million and have been projected
to reach 90 million by 1985. Spain and other northwest Mediterranean countries
are expected to retain about three-quarters of the total market; the Balkans
are noted as an area with excellent potential for growth with arrivals from
the 13 West European tourist generating countries included in the study
(representing about 60% of arrivals in 1973) projected to reach 18 million
by 1985, up from 7 million in 1973. For Turkey, arrivals are projected at
about 1.6 million in 1985, up from about 780 thousand in 1973, which repre-
sents a growth rate of about 10% compared with about 6% for the whole
Mediterranean:
Annual Growth Rates in Tourist Arrivals
1965/73            1973/80          1980/85
Turkey                     10.2                11.2              9.3
Balkans                    15.2                 9.8              6.2
Total Mediterranean         8.4                 5.3              4.4
Turkey would almost double its market share of Mediterranean arrivals from
about 1% in 1973 to 1.8% by 1985 and according to Battelle estimates would
need an additional 52,000 beds by 1980.
The Turkish Market
2.          The number of foreign tourists visiting Turkey increased from
155,000 in 1963 to 776,000 in 1973 which represents a growth rate of 17.5%.
Visitor arrivals dropped in 1974 due to the Cyprus war but indications are
that the 1973 peak will be surpassed in 1975. In 1974, about 66% of visitors
came from Western Europe, led by West Germany (22%); France (11%); Britain
(9%); Italy and Scandinavia (7% each); North America excluding U.S. service
men (13%); the Middle East (12%); and Eastern Europe and Scandinavia (8% and
7% respectively), (Annex I, Tables 5-8). The average length of stay has
.1/ Battelle Institute in Geneva; consultant to the Bank.



ANNEX IX
Page 2
increased from 5.6 days in 1970 to 6.5 days in 1974. In addition, Turkey
receives about half a million excursionists 1/ annually.
3.          Several broad markets of foreign travelers can be identified
within Turkey. The market of travelers to Istanbul, the leading destination
(50% of arrivals) is composed of businessmen and tourists on short stays of
1-3 days, as part of multi-country tours. A second market is composed of
visitors on 1-3 week circuit tours of regions of Turkey, such as the Black
Sea area, the Marmara area and Cappadocia (Central Anatolia). A third market
comprises the visitors to vacation villages, generally located on the Aegean
Sea around Kusadasi (such as the Club Mediterrane'e facilities), where visitors
stay for one, two or three weeks, often combining a stay at a vacation village
with a circuit tour. These three markets account for an estimated 80% of
total visitors. Ankara as the capital absorbs 3-5% whereas very few come to
the Mediterranean coast or the eastern part of the country. The distribution
of hotel capacity (Annex I, Table 2) clearly reflects this pattern of tourist
distribution throughout the country.
4.          Turkey as a whole is mainly a seasonal destination; Istanbul,
however, as a leading international business and commercial center, is a
year round destination. Resorts on the Aegean have a 5-6 month tourist season
whereas the Mediterranean coast's season lasts from 6-8 months.  The peak
tourism months are July and August, with about 17% of foreign arrivals each
month (Annex I, Table 5). Tourist arrivals average 12% in September, 10% in
May and June and 8% in April and October.
5.          Domestic travel is a significant element of Turkey's overall
tourism and involves two distinct groups of travelers: the high-income earner
who visits hotels and vacation villages in the luxury to "B" class establish-
ments; and the lower income earner who visits "C" and "D" class hotels and
pensions. It is very difficult to quantify this market since many Turks stay
in non-registered hotels for which there are no statistics. From a
hotelier's point of view, however, domestic travel represents an important
market as it serves to lengthen the season and fill up rooms in slack periods.
6.          The only establishments in the Antalya region which can be
considered of international standard are the Antalya Hotel (150 rooms) opened
in 1975 and the Valtur Vacation Village (350 rooms) opened in 1973. The
South Antalya project can be considered as a "new" resort whose market will
develop independently of traditional markets to Turkey.

The South Antalya Project
7.          The lack of suitable accommodation facilities has held up the
development of tourism and as a result tour operators have sent very little
business to Turkey, with the exception of Istanbul, the Club Mediterranee
villages, and very recently, two vacation villages, one near Kemer (Valtur),
the other at Cesme (Golden Dolphin). The project would be the first integrated
tourism development in Turkey aimed at the European mass market. It would be
presented as a new tourism area, with an untapped potential and would be
marketed through tour operators.
8.          The creation of a positive image and the launching of a major
resort requires a sound marketing policy and strategy based, in this case,
on the realities of the tour operator market. Such a program would consist
of preparing generic promotion for the Antalya region and creating tour
operator interest in the project, during the construction phase, with a view
to getting contracts signed for the first year of operation. Timing of this
program will be critical and the Ministry of Tourism and Information would
work closely with investors in the project area to create a joint program.
In order to provide for preparation of such a program, consultants would be
retained to prepare a market strategy program for the South Antalya project,
which would be implemented by the MTI.
9.          Turkish residents will use the project facilities, but Western
Europe will be the major target market for South Antalya, particularly Germany
and Scandinavia, followed by England, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
A secondary but important market is also expected to develop from the Middle
East countries. A broad range of prices and accommodation types would be
offered to attract a varied clientele. Turkey offers excellent prospects
for single destination holidays, with or without extensions for tours to one
or several parts of the country. Thus a whole range of packages from long
weekends up to three and four weeks is possible. The land portion of packages
for South Antalya is estimated from US$164 to US$286 in hotels V/ and about
US$240 4n vacation villages (in 1975 prices). These packages are considered
to be competitive for Eastern Mediterranean destinations.
Market Justification
10.         The Mediterranean Coast of Turkey has excellent potential for
developing sun and beach based tourism. Its main advantages are its climate,
cultural heritage and unspoiled coastlines. The site of South Antalya is
highly competitive because of (1) its long summer season 2/; (2) its dramatic
landscape of forested mountains set off against the blue sea; (3) its excellent
1/ Two-week package, double occupancy, MAP, transfers, taxes and service
included.
2/ It even has a winter season for skiing on the nearby Tekerlektepe mountains.



ANNEX IX
Page 4
excursion potential to ancient cities and sites, such as Phaselis, in the
project area, and Perge, Olympos, Termessos, Aspendos, Konya and Cappadocia;
(4) its proximity to an urban center (Antalya) and (5) relatively easy air
access from most European tourist-generating countries. Disadvantages are
the only fair quality of beaches and sea bed and the danger of pollution
from the Antalya harbor, some 35 km north of the project.
11.         For several reasons, European travelers have found Turkey to be
an expensive destination, in comparison to Spain for instance. Firstly,
mass tourism to Turkey has not yet developed and therefore lower prices made
possible through high volume are not yet in evidence, although Holiday Club
packages to Turkey cost already about the same for Club Mediterranee members
coming from Paris as packages to Agadir and Marrakech in Morocco, and Djerba
in Tunisia. Secondly, transport costs are higher, since Turkey, when compared
to other Mediterranean destinations, is relatively distant from the main travel
generating European countries. Moreover, there have been few charter flights
to Turkey and therefore the public has had little opportunity to buy lower
priced packages. However, group air fares are available on THY. For example,
the high season GIT 1/ to Antalya (via Istanbul) from London is i 55 (US$113)
midweek, compared to the economy round trip excursion fare of E 166.80
(US$342) and the regular economy fare of i 333 (US$683); individual charter
rates of i 40 (US$82) have been available, on a limited basis.
12.         The package prices prepared for South Antalya compare favorably,
with other Eastern Mediterranean destinations, particularly with Greece
and mideast destinations. They approximate packages offered at the Valtur
village, whose bed occupancy has increased steadily to 75% (seasonal) in the
three years it has been open, and at the recently opened Antalya Hotel.
However, South Antalya should not attempt to offer the cheapest vacations
but rather in conformity with its cost structure, it should offer high quality
vacations. Tour operators consider Turkey to offer excellent value for money
spent, with respect to outside-hotel expenditures for food, entertainment and
souvenirs. Moreover, past experience suggests that international tourism is
income elastic. With quality possibly higher than in Western Mediterranean
countries, South Antalya would appeal to higher income earners whose expendi-
ture patterns are more impervious to fluctuating economic conditions.
13.         As part of project preparation, tour operators in the main
European generating countries, 2/ as well as Turkish tour operators, were
interviewed as to their opinions on Turkey, as a travel destination and also
on the South Antalya project. They consider Turkey to be endowed with
1/ Group Inclusive Tour.
2/ Between 60-80% of tour operators in each of the following countries were
polled: Denmark, England, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy,
Austria, France and Germany (44 tour operators were visited).

excellent potential, although complicated by the political situation. The
main problems cited were the shortage of trained bilingual staff and the
need for good management (especially for marketing and maintenance). Also
impeding tourism have been the severe shortages of both airline and hotel
capacity in the peak season. The South Antalya project is designed to over-
come some of these problems.
14e         In regard to airline capacity, although THY would be willing to
serve new markets, the South Antalya tourism project would create large
demands on the airline; fleet restrictions and the fact that THY does not
have a charter subsidiary would make it difficult for THY to service South
Antalya. It would therefore be necessary that the Government permit foreign
carriers to carry a large proportion (more than 50%) of visitors to South
Antalya. Moreover, since many tour operators operate their own airlines,
they would probably be unwilling to serve South Antalya, unless they could
fly their own equipment.
15.         The Government's air access policy is closely related to the
question of airline capacity. Presently, Antalya airport can receive inter-
national charter flights and it is being expanded (completion in 1979) in
anticipation of tourism development. However, in addition to charter flights,
it may be desirable to permit scheduled service to Antalya so that visitors
could get to Antalya directly, without a change of plane in Istanbul or
Ankara, Turkey's two fully international airports. The General Directorate
of Civil Aviation (Ministry of Trade) does not, in principle, object to
Antalya's being declared a fully international airport, but prefers not to
take such a step until such time as the market demands it.
Market Projections
16.         As discussed above, Turkey has little relevant prior experience
on which to project the growth of tourism, particularly since the project is
based on a new kind of tourism for Turkey. The justification for the project
is based on the assumption that the Mediterranean tourism industry is sound
and that well planned new hotels can develop a clientele given a realistic
assessment of market opportunities. The effects of various political events
upon future tourism development have been excluded from the following analysis.
17.         The number of foreign visitors to South Antalya is estimated at
10,700 in 1979, 93,000 in 1985 and 131,000 in 1990. 1/ The assumptions used
for this estimate are based on projected seasonal occupancies for accom-
modation facilities of 75% 1/ (Annex VIII), an average length of stay of
10 days, and a domestic tourism share of 207% of total arrivals.
1/ Excludes campers and excursionists.



ANNEX IX
Page 6
18.         The projected number of tourists appears reasonable in the context
of projections of foreign visitors to Turkey. The growth rate of arrivals in
Turkey was 17.5% between 1963 and 1973 and 11% between 1970 and 1974; the
average Mediterranean growth rate was about 8% from 1965/73 but is expected
to drop progressively to about 4% by 1985.  Based on the assumption that over
the long run, Turkish growth rates will level to regional levels, total
arrivals in Turkey should reach about 1.1 million in 1980, 1.4 million by
1985 and 1,7 million by 1990 (Table 1). Foreign arrivals at South Antalya
would be equal to 8% of total arrivals in Turkey under this hypothesis. Under
the "most likely" hypothesis retained by the Battelle Institute, South Antalya
arrivals would equal only about 4% of arrivals in Turkey.
19.         South Antalya is, in many respects (season, climate, allure),
like Rhodes, the Greek island close to Turkey which has enjoyed a dramatic
development of tourism. In 1959, when charter flights started arriving, there
were no more than 600 rooms on Rhodes; in 1973, room capacity had expanded to
9,000 with three new hotels under construction. For the 1973-1974 season
lasting from Easter to November 10, room occupancy was an estimated 70%. This
represents a growth from about 15,000 visitors in 1959 to almost 220,000 in
1973. The development projected for South Antalya, although about one-third
smaller than Rhodes' current tourism plan, appears reasonable in the context
of Rhodes' development.

TURKEY: SOUTH ANTALYA TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Financial Plan
1.          The total project cost is estimated at US$66.0 million equi-
valent plus US$4.0 million interest during construction. The Bank loaa is to
cover the foreign exchange component, plus interest during construction, or 37%
of financing required. Based on these assum.ptions, the following is a sum-
mary financial plan for the South Antalya project, excluding working capital
(TL millions):

2.          For the purpose of forecasting, it has been assumed that the
IBRD loan would be at 8.5% interest for 25 years, including a six-year grace
period, and would be made available as cash transfers to the various ministries
and agencies involved in project execution. Funds for electric power (US$2.6
million), however, would be onlent by the Government to Kepez and for telecom-
munications (US$1.8 million) to PTT for ten years, including three years of
grace, at 11% interest. It has also been assumed that Government funds would
be in the form of annual budget allocations.



ANNEX X
Page 2
3.          Financial aspects of the water supply and sewerage, the electricity,
and the hotel training center components are treated separately in Annexes V,
VI and VII. No financial analysis has been made for the roads component
(including the road component in the Kemer infrastructure) or for the tele-
communications component. The financial analysis of the other components is
detailed below.
4.          PRD will have no separate legal status as a company.  Financial
discipline is, therefore, difficult to establish and is complicated by the
fact that revenue and expense accrue to different agencies of the Government
(for example, ground rent is collected by the Ministry of Forestry and the
Treasury). Accordingly, the approach used has been to project operating
revenue and expense statements separately for the following components: the
national park, Phaselis archaeological site, employee housing, and a grouping
(called PRD) which covers the Kemer infrastructure and urban improvement
component, the small craft harbor, solid waste disposal, project administration
and land. A consolidated project funds flow statement was prepared, covering
these and the other project components. The financial objectives would be
to recover investment costs plus a reasonable rate of return (based on a
consolidated rate of return) through appropriate user charges.
5.          For forecasting purposes, 1975 prices have been inflated to 1981
levels using a factor of 1.5 (para. 4.16). For a period of five years after
1981, inflation has been assumed to be 12%. Projections are given in Tables
1, 2 and 3, and assumptions are detailed in Attachment 1.
National Park (Table 1)
6.          The national park will have revenue (accruing to the Ministry of
Forestry) from its campsites, day use beach areas, and snack bars. 1/ The
campsites will provide space for 900 tents.  Occupancy has been assumed to
rise from 40% to 50% (210-day season) over a six-year period, with an average
of two persons per tent, a length of stay of three nights, and a per person
daily expenditure of TL 12.50 (1975 level).  The day use area is for 2,500
persons.  A 50% seasonal usage rate has been assumed with an average per
person daily expenditure of TL 5.00.  It has been assumed that 75% of campers
will frequent the snack bars, spending daily an average of TL 15 per person.
The gross operating profit has been estimated at 75% of total revenue. Opera-
ting costs do not cover the reforestation program or park service overhead,
which is assumed to be part of the Ministry's budget. The DCF rate of return
is 9.3%.
Phaselis Archaeological Site (Table 1)
7.          The Phaselis archaeological site will generate revenue (accruing
to the Ministry of Culture) in the form of entrance fees. Entrance fees to
1/ In addition, it may collect ground rent (para. 4).



ANNEX X
Page 3
historic sites in Turkey are currently TL 11 per person, plus a varying charge
for the right to take photographs. For the financial projections, an average
daily expenditure of TL 15 has been assumed and a visitation rate of 1.2 visits
per tourist. Operating costs, based on consultants' estimates, have been set
at TL 848,000 per year.
Employee Housing (Table 1)
8.          Employee housing is considered both an incentive for investors and
a social benefit for the project. Revenue (accruing to the Ministry of
Tourism and Information) would be in the form of rents paid directly by hotel
operators. Rents have been set at TL 13,000 per year for each of the 280
units, which assures breakeven recovery of the investment and operating costs.
Family size has been assumed to be five, with two employees per family. The
rental is equivalent to 25% of estimated family take-home pay (based on gross
per person salary of TL 3,500 per month and net salary equal to 65% of gross),
which is considered an acceptable level. Operating costs for the housing
component have been set at 1% of investment in housing.
Project Directorate (Table 2)
9.          PRD would derive revenue from the following sources:  the leasing
of hotel sites; the leasing of properties, including shops, bus terminal,
small industrial facilities, restaurants, the small craft harbor facilities,
and the two pleasure boats; the collection of electricity charges from non-
hotel users; the provision of certain services (e.g., solid waste disposal,
project maintenance) relating to the maintenance of common facilities and
amenities. Ground rent has been calculated at an average TL 1,000 (US$66.7)
per room per year for 80% of hotel capacity (leases are negotiated on a case-
by-case basis by the Ministry of Forestry or the Treasury); service charges
have been estimated at TL 1,000 (US$66.67) per room; electricity has been
filled at TL 0.55 per kwh for non-hotel users and TL 0.41 paid to Kepez.
Rentals have been based on a percentage of projected revenue (or investment)
so as to yield rates of return of 10-20%.
10.         Operating costs include maintenance of the project area (beaches,
landscaping, internal roads, etc.), promotional and administrative activities.
Maintenance cost was set at 1.5% of fixed assets. Promotional expenses are
nominal. Administrative expense was based on a staffing schedule plus an
allowance (20% of payroll) for overhead.
Consolidated Cash Flow (Table 3)
11.         The overall financial plan for the project, as shown above,
calls for a Bank loan of US$21.9 million plus US$7.7 million interest during
construction and a Government contribution of US$44.8 million (TL 671.5
million) for a total project cost of US$73.6 million plus funds for the
operation of the hotel school. Based on this financial plan, a consolidated



ANNEX X
Page 4
sources and application of funds is presented in Table 3. The project fully
covers its debt service from the second full year of operation and reaches
an acceptable 1.4 coverage in the fourth year of operation.
12.         For a project life of 30 years, the overall dcf financial rate
of return on the project is 8%, not including the roads and telecommunications
components, and also excluding property taxes, which would eventually accrue
indirectly to the project.

TURKEY: SOUTH ANTALYA TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Introduction
1.          The project is designed to provide basic infrastructure support
for a major development of tourism (superstructure) facilities and for a
corresponding expansion of the local population's need for utilities and
other public services. For purposes of economic evaluation, the total
investment program is taken to include both the infrastructure components
to be financed under the proposed project and the superstructure facilities
which are expected to be developed by the private sector. The costs and
benefits of this overall investment program are described below, with the
exception of the water supply and sewerage and the hotel training components
which are dealt with separately in Annexes V and VII, respectively.
Project Economic Boundaries
2.          The accommodation facilities to be developed in the project area
are expected to serve primarily foreign tourists (80% of total bednights 1/)
and to be oriented almost exclusively to the charter-group holiday market.
Since these tourists would arrive and depart from Antalya Airport, and would
come on the basis of pre-arranged tour packages (including air fare, accommo-
dation, meals, airport transfer, etc.), the primary impact of their expendi-
tures would be within the physical boundaries of the project investment
program.
3.          Some portion of the net revenues from international transportation
generated by the project would accrue to the Turkish national airline, to
Antalya Airport (in the form of landing fees) and to suppliers of aircraft
services (such as catering and maintenance). The benefits and costs of these
activities, however, are not included in the calculation of project rates of
return. Similarly, the local transport costs (and related benefits) resulting
from domestic tourists (20% of total bednights) who drive or fly to the pro-
ject area have also been excluded from the rate of return calculations.
Costs and Benefits of Tourist Activities
4.          The gross benefits resulting from the development of tourism
facilities, in terms of market values, would be the expenditures in the
project area of tourists who stay in the resort accommodation (or camping)
facilities. Because of the rather limited development of such resort
1/ See Appendix 3 to this annex, para. 1.



ANNEX XI
Page 2
facilities in Turkey up to now, especially in the South Antalya area, and
because of the relatively high occupancy rates being experienced by poten-
tially competing accommodation facilities on Turkey's west coast, the pro-
ject is expected to attract essentially untapped holiday tourism demand. 1/
In this sense, the projected visitor bednights in the project area have
been assumed to represent incremental tourism traffic to Turkey as a whole,
rather than a diversion of demand from existing destinations in the country.
5.          The costs which are associated with these gross benefits, in
terms of market values, would be the capital and operating costs of the
infrastructure provided under the proposed project, and of the projected
superstructure facilities expected to be built by the private sector.
6.          These costs and benefits are described below.  The economic
evaluation has been carried out in constant (late 1975) prices; estimated
price contingencies, therefore, have been excluded. In order to calculate
the net benefits of the project in economic terms, the financial (market)
values of goods and services produced or consumed by the project have been
adjusted through the use of effective exchange rate (reflecting import
and export duties) and efficiency prices for labor and land. The nature of
these adjustments, and their derivation, are described in detail in
Appendix 1 of this annex.
Without the Project
7.          In the event this project did not go ahead, it is unlikely that
any significant development of tourism facilities oriented to the foreign
visitor market would occur in the project area. This assumption is based
on the historical record in South Antalya, which indicates clearly that few
private sector investments in accommodation facilities of international
standard are made in remote areas in the absence of supporting infrastructure.
For this reason, the costs and benefits "with" the project are assumed to
be entirely incremental as compared to the situation "without" the project.
8.          To the extent that some further development of tourism facilities
would occur in the area in the absence of the project, the corresponding net
benefits of the "without the project" case are assumed to be offset by the non-
quantifiable environmental benefits "with" the project resulting from a care-
fully planned, comprehensive development of both tourism facilities and sup-
porting infrastructure for the local population.
Revenue (Benefit) Assumptions
9.          While the hotels and related superstructure facilities outside
of hotels (shops, nightclubs, etc.) would receive revenues directly from
the tourist visitors, the revenue earning infrastructure components would
1/  At present, Turkey receives only about 1% of the total tourist arrivals
in the Mediterranean.



ANNEX XI
Page 3
be compensated only indirectly through the payment of user-charges by those
superstructure facilities. 1/ Certain of the non-revenue earning infrastruc-
ture components which are necessary for the development of tourist facilities
(such as street and sidewalk improvements in Kemer) would also generate
benefits to the local population. The manner in which these benefits (includ-
ing non-quantifiable ones) have been taken into account is described below.
10.         The receipts of the hotels and holiday villages are based on
projected bednights and average daily expenditures for tourists staying in
those accommodation facilities. The weighted average daily expenditure with-
in the hotels and holiday villages per tourist is estimated to be TL 290,
including sales taxes (US$19.35 equivalent). 2/
11.         The expenditures of tourists outside of hotels, for day-excursions,
shopping, restaurants and nightclubs, have been estimated on the basis of
projected bednights in hotels, and the estimated average daily expenditures
for each type of activity outside of hotels. These estimated expenditures
are described in detail in Appendix 2 of this annex. The weighted average
daily expenditure outside of hotels has been estimated to be TL 114 includ-
ing sales taxes (US$7.60 equivalent). 3/
12.         The National Park would receive revenues from camping and day-
beach fees and from catering facilities such as snack bars. The market
projections and average daily expenditures for this component are described
in Annex X. 4/
13.         The electricity component of the project would generate revenues
based on user-charges paid by the hotels, other commercial activities, and
local residential consumers. The investments which would be covered by the
proposed project, however, involve primarily transmission lines and substations,
rather than generating equipment. (The emergency power supply equipment is
dealt with below, para. 14). The transmission element includes both a main
line from the city of Antalya to the tourism area and a distribution network
11  Or, in the case of infrastructure which also serves the local population
(such as electricity), through direct payment of user-charges.
2/ See Annex VIII, Accommodation Development. The average daily expenditure
within accommodation facilities, as well as the structure of demand in
terms of seasonality and category of accommodation desired, is assumed
to be the same for both foreign and domestic tourists; this is largely
because domestic tourist demand for the accommodation categories expected
to be offered is likely to be that of relatively higher-income groups --
such as businessmen and their families from Istanbul.
3/  TL 90 per day for domestic tourists and TL 120 per day for foreign tourists.
4/ The proportion of total camp bednights represented by foreign visitors is
the reverse of that for hotels and holiday villages; 20% are expected to
be foreign, and 80% domestic.

within the tourism area. This main line will also serve the resident popula-
tion between Antalya and Kemer and, in any event, would be a necessary invest-
ment without the project in order to extend electrical service from Antalya
to areas further south and west -- beyond the tourism zone.
14.         Because this component relates only to electricity transmission
and does not include costs of additional electricity production, it would
not be appropriate to compare the investment cost of this component with the
net revenues from electricity consumption in the tourism zone. The total
incremental investment cost should include any additional investments in
generating capacity required to meet the increased demand for electricity
as a result of the project. Given the difficulties in both calculating these
incremental costs properly, 1/ and allocating the main transmission line
investment cost correctly between the tourism zone and the other areas, a
rate of return calculation for the electricity (transmission) component has
not been attempted. Instead, this investment has been excluded from the
project investment costs, and the user-charges paid by consumers have been
assumed to recover the full economic cost of both generating and transmit-
ting electricity to the area. In order to avoid the possibility that existing
tariffs may understate the full economic costs of electricity, 2/ an (artifi-
cial) "surcharge" amounting to 50% has been applied to the electricity costs
(in projected financial statements) in calculating the economic rate of
return.
15.         In addition to transmission lines and substations, the project
also provides for the acquisition of emergency generators in order to ensure
a continuous power supply to the hotels and other tourist facilities. In
the absence of any prediction as to the likely amount of their use, the cost
of these generators has been included as part of the project investment
program while the benefits have been assumed to be offset by the costs of
operation when they are actually used. 3/
16.         The roads component of the project includes both access roads
within the tourism area and improvements to the main road connection between
Antalya city and Tekirova. The benefits to foreign tourists from road con-
struction and improvement in the area are (implicitly) incorporated in the
1/ The electricity to be supplied to the area by the Antalya power company
(Kepez) is expected to be purchased largely from the national power
company (TEK).
2/ The appraisal report on the most recent Bank loan to TEK indicates that
current (late 1975) tariffs are not sufficiently high to meet rate of
return standards agreed upon earlier.
3/ To the extent that they are used frequently, this approach will under-
estimate the net benefits from the emergency power supply investment,
but over-estimate the (implicit) return on the main transmission line.



ANNEX XI

projected expenditures of foreign tourist visitors. 1/ These investments,
therefore, have been included in the project's investment program for
purposes of calculating an economic rate of return. Additional benefits,
however, will also accrue to the local population, especially as a result
of improvements to the Antalya-Tekirova highway, in the form of vehicle
operating cost savings. It has been assumed that these benefits (combined
with increased Government tax receipts on transport -- such as fuel) would
offset the maintenance costs of the roads over the life of the project.
17.         The proposed investments in Kemer are designed to meet a variety
of needs and have, therefore, been treated in different ways according to
the type of benefits which each is expected to produce. The health clinic
is expected to generate some financial revenues, but substantially higher
non-quantifiable benefits to the local population. The investments in open
areas and sports facilities are similarly expected to generate non-quantifi-
able benefits, and are regarded by the Government as important components in
the proper development of urban communities. Accordingly, the health clinic
and the urban amenities have been omitted from the project rate of return
calculations. (Together they represent only about 4% of the total proposed
investments in Kemer.)
18.         The small industries building and the bus terminal are expected
to produce financial returns both to PRD (in the form of rental income) and
to the individual occupants and operators (in the form of profits on sales).
Since it is not possible, however, to identify the specific occupants or
operators at this time, and since the rental income to PRD is expected to
recover the full economic costs of the facilities, these two items have also
been excluded from the project rate of return calculations. (Together they
represent only about 8% of the total proposed investments in Kemer.)
19.         Among the urban infrastructure investments in Kemer, the main
elements are essentially non-revenue earning (i.e., storm water drainage,
streets, parking and walkways). 2/ While these investments will obviously
benefit the local population, the main purpose for such improvements is to
develop Kemer into an urban focal point (and service center) for the nearby
tourism resort facilities. The nature of the benefits generated by these
investments, however, make it rather difficult to quantify either the abso-
lute level of such benefits or the proportion which would accrue to the
local population. In order to be conservative, therefore, the investment
costs have been included in the rate of return calculations, while the
benefits to the local population are assumed simply to offset the maintenance
cost of the items over the life of the project.
1/ Consumer surplus accruing to foreign tourists is ignored.
2/ These components represent 78% of the proposed investment program in
Kemer.

20.         The development of employee housing by PRD represents not only
an incentive for potential hotel investors, but also an effort to ensure
that reasonable housing will be available to permanent staff. The economic
benefits from this investment are assumed to correspond to the level of
rental income expected to be charged by PRD, which would be equivalent to
25% of net family take-home pay, assuming two employees per household.
21.         The financial revenues and costs of the water supply and sewer-
age component are described in detail in Annex V. Since the projected
financial returns appear to be acceptable, and since the hotels would pay
user-charges higher than those established for local consumers, this compo-
nent is considered to be justified on economic grounds as well. The invest-
ment in telecommunications has been excluded on similar grounds. 1/
Investment Cost Assumptions
22.         Investment costs for the infrastructure components of the pro-
ject have been derived from the financial estimates of construction costs
(or purchase prices) described in Annex II. The investment costs for hotels
and holiday villages are derived from the financial cost estimates described
in Annex IX. Investment costs of superstructure outside of hotels, such as
shops and restaurants, have been estimated on the basis of incremental
capital/sales ratios, as described (below) in Appendix 2. 2/
23.         On the basis of these financial cost estimates, the adjustments
to market prices described in Appendix 1, and the comments in paras. 13 to
21 above, the overall investment program on which an economic rate of return
has been calculated is shown below:
1/ Although they have not been included in the economic rate of return
calculations, these investments would only represent about 5-6% of the
overall investment program (see para. 23); the inclusion of the relevant
investment costs and gross operating profits for these components would
have no significant effect on the estimated IER.
2/ Certain of the items contained in the proposed project infrastructure
components (such as the yacht club and the restaurant in the small
harbor, and the development of Phaselis for day-excursions) have been
included in superstructure investments outside of hotels.

Operating Cost Assumptions
24.         The projected operating costs and the corresponding gross opera-
ting profits in economic terms for hotels and holiday villages have been
derived from the financial forecasts described in Annex VIII. The financial
operating costs and gross operating profits of commercial activities outside
of hotels, and the derived economic costs and profits, are described (below)
in Appendix 2.
25.         The economic gross operating profits of the National Park oper-
ations 1/ have been derived from financial operating results described in
Annex X. Net economic benefits resulting from employee housing have been
estimated on the basis of proposed rental charges and an assumed annual
maintenance cost equal to about 1% of the initial capital costs.
26.         The maintenance and replacement costs of roads and of the main
infrastructure components in Kemer have been assumed to be offset by bene-
fits to the local population (see paras.16 and 19 above). Annual replace-
ment costs for hotels are estimated to be 1% of the initial capital invest-
ment. Annual replacement costs for commercial activities outside of hotels
1/ Camping and day-use beaches.



ANNEX XI
Page 8
are calculated (below) in Appendix 2, and amount to a weighted average of
above 7% of the initial capital investment, due to the shorter economic
life of the assets (such as buses used for day-excursions).
27.         Residual values for land and for the major superstructure facil-
ities (some of which are constructed as late as 1989) have been calculated
on the basis of the estimated economic life of individual assets, taking into
account assumed replacement practices.
28.         Project Directorate (PRD) costs -- after the construction
period for the infrastructure components -- involve primarily maintenance
and promotional expenses and general overhead (such as technical staff
salaries). 1/ These costs have been taken into account in the project's
operating cost streams, since the GOP's of hotels and other superstructure
activities have been included in the project's benefit streams before sub-
tracting out charges for land lease and other fees payable to PRD. 2/
Internal Rate of Return
29.         The cost and benefit streams based on all of the assumptions
described above are summarized in Table I of this Annex. The internal econ-
omic rate of return on the overall investment program, using a 25-year dis-
counting horizon, would be 17.2%. 31
30.         The sensitivity of this rate of return to alternative assumptions
regarding investment costs and gross operating profits is indicated in the
table below:
1/ Since the project administration building would be turned over to the
local municipality after about six years, only about 40% of the costs
of that building has been included as an investment cost to the project.
The remaining 60% would represent benefits to the municipality in the
form of (implicit) rental income.
2/ i.e., such fees have not been included as revenues to PRD or as costs
to hotels.
3/ The possibility of "tied" foreign capital being used in the project
is dealt with in Appendix 3, paras. 9-11.

31.         While the timing of the proposed infrastructure investments is
relatively assured, the implementation of superstructure investments in
accord with the forecasts described in Annexes IX (Market) and VIII (Accom-
modation Development), is somewhat less certain. In order to test the
sensitivity of the economic rate of return on the overall investment program
to alternative assumptions about the phasing of the superstructure components,
additional rates of return have been calculated and are shown below. In each
case, the timing of infrastructure investments was assumed to be as fore-
casted, while the timing of superstructure investments was assumed to be
delayed by increments of a year. g
Superstructure Delayed                  Resulting Rate of Return (%)
by:  one year                                 16.8
two years                                15.8
three years                              15.0
four years                               14.1
1/ It is entirely possible, however, that the hotels' development fore-
cast in the later years (1985-89) may in fact be accelerated. While
a rate of return on this assumption has not been calculated, it would
probably result in only a slight improvement in the IER.

Distribution of Project Benefits
32.         The three main beneficiaries of the net economic benefits
generated by the project would be: (a) the Government; (b) the workers to
be employed in tourism activities and, in particular, those who are expected
to reside in Kemer; and (c) the private sector businessmen who invest in the
hotels and related tourism facilities.
33.         Taking the last group first, the private sector investors would
receive financial returns from the operation of hotels equivalent to approx-
imately a 10% (DCF) rate of return on total capital invested, in constant
dollar terms (see Annex X). The return on equity in current prices may be
somewhat higher depending on debt/equity ratios, the interest rate on bor-
rowed funds, and the course of general price level movements in Turkey. The
(DCF) returns on capital invested outside of the hotels would be somewhat
better (a weighted average of about 18%) but, taken as a whole, these finan-
cial returns are unlikely to differ significantly over the longer term from
the returns available in other sectors, after due allowance for risk in dif-
ferent sectors. As a result, the level of income going to businessmen who
invest in tourism facilities in the project area would probably not differ
from the level of income they would otherwise expect to receive if the pro-
ject did not go ahead.
34.         The workers (and their families) who are employed in tourism
activities as a result of the project would benefit primarily from the higher
level of remuneration in tourism activities as compared with alternative
forms of employment. The development of Kemer as a planned urban center will
also generate benefits to the local inhabitants, including those who are not
directly employed in supplying tourism goods and services, which would other-
wise not be available to them in the absence of a major development of tourism
facilities. In point of fact, the regional development impact of several of
the major infrastructure investments (such as the Antalya-Tekirova highway
improvements, and the extension of the electrical distribution system to the
area) will eventually serve to benefit most of those local inhabitants en-
gaged in activities unrelated to the development of tourism. The project
may reasonably be said, therefore, to have a favorable impact on the general
level of economic welfare within the region as a whole.
35.         The Central Government will benefit both directly and indirectly
from its investments in the project area. Those Government agencies which
operate revenue-earning project components (including PRD), are expected to
recover the relevant investment costs plus, in most cases, a reasonable rate
of return. Included in the direct returns to the Government, however, is the
payment by tourist visitors of a 10% sales tax on rooms, food and beverage
expenditures. This item alone would amount to about TL 920 million (US$61.3
million equivalent) over the life of the project, equal to 144% of the Govern-
ment contribution to financing the project. Approximately 80% of these sales
taxes would be paid in foreign currencies. In addition, of course, the
Government would receive indirect taxes and duties on goods and services
purchased by the tourism industry and also income taxes on individuals and
firms engaged directly in meeting the final demand of tourist visitors.

Balance of Payments and Employment Effect
36.         The impact of the project on the balance of payments is
described (below) in Appendix 3. As shown in the table attached to that
Appendix, the net foreign exchange earnings generated by the project are
estimated to rise from TL 214 million (US$14.3 million) in 1981, when the
infrastructure components are expected to be completed to about TL 435
million (US$29 million) annually from 1991, when the accommodation facil-
ities reach their full development.
37.         The employment estimated to be generated by the project is
described (below) in Appendix 4. As shown in the table attached to that
Appendix, the total employment created directly and indirectly by the
project would amount to about 7,240 jobs in 1981 and about 12,600 jobs
from 1991 onward.

TURKEY: SOUTH ANTALYA TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
A NOTE ON PRICE ADJUSTMENTS
Introduction
1.       The purpose of this note is to describe the adjustments which have
been made to market values in order to estimate the net contribution of the
project to Turkey in terms of economic values. Basically, those adjustments
involve the use of efficiency rather than market prices in calculating the
costs and benefits of the project. The underlying concept of the efficiency
prices used in the analysis is that of "efficiency" in maximizing the country's
output of goods and services. Thus the estimated efficiency price for an
input, such as labor, which is expected to be employed in the project would
be based on the benefits (output) which might be obtained elsewhere in the
economy if that input were employed in its best alternative use.
2.       The sections below describe the approach used in estimating the
effective exchange rate and the efficiency prices of labor and land. The
way in which these prices have been used to calculate the economic costs
and benefits of the South Antalya tourism project is illustrated in the table
attached to this Appendix. 1/
Effective Exchange Rate
3.       Most Bank projects involve both foreign exchange costs, for
imported goods and services, and foreign exchange receipts (or savings 2/)
for exported goods and services. The market value of these "tradeable"
goods and services is normally quoted in c.i.f. or f.o.b. prices expressed
in foreign currencies. Most Bank projects also involve both domestic costs,
for non-traded inputs (such as land), and domestic revenues, for non-traded
output (such as electricity or water). The market value of these goods and
is normally quoted in domestic prices expressed in the local currency.
Since it is necessary to carry out the economic analysis of a project in
a single, specified currency, then either the world market prices of traded
items must be converted into their equivalent domestic market prices in
local currency, or the domestic market prices of non-traded goods must be
converted into their equivalent world market prices in some foreign currency
1/ The example used is the Solid Waste Component of the infrastructure
investment program. Additional examples for commercial activities,
such as shops and restaurants, are shown in Appendix 2.

such as U.S. dollars. It is also necessary to ensure, however, that no
distortions are introduced in the estimated efficiency prices for the relevant
goods and services as a result of using an inappropriate exchange rate. Hence,
the effective exchange rate is used to avoid such distortions.
Efficiency Wage Rate
4.       In estimating an appropriate efficiency price for labor used in the
project, a number of considerations need to be taken into account. These
include the distinction between skilled and unskilled workers, permanent and
seasonal workers, and urban and rural workers.
5.       Most of the direct employment generated by the South Antalya tourism
project would be in hotels and in related commercial activities outside of
hotels, such as shops, nightclubs and restaurants. On the basis of some
necessarily rough assumption, 1/ the proportion of skilled workers to total
workers (as reflected in the "payroll" item of projected financial statements)
has been estimated to be 45% within the hotels, and 30% for commercial activ-
ities outside of hotels. The remaining proportion of total workers ("payroll"),
55% in hotels and 70% outside hotels, is estimated to be unskilled.
6.       The tourist "season" for hotels has been estimated to be about seven
months (210 days), from April to October. Most of the hotels, and possibly
many of the other commercial activities, are expected to be closed for the
remaining five months of the year. 2/ Some of the hotels, however, and pro-
bably more of the other activities (which also serve the local population)
would remain open year round. And, even for those which are closed, a certain
amount of employment would still be generated in the winter months by main-
tenance work, repairs and general up-keep requirements. On the basis of some-
what rough assumptions, the proportion of peak-month employment which represents
'permanent" employment has been conservatively estimated to be about 30%.
7.       Given the generally low level of urban development in the area, with
the exception of Antalya City, the workers who would be employed in the hotels
and related commercial activities might reasonably be classified as rural. In
the case of Turkey, however, this distinction may not be very important, since
the pool of urban unemployed largely represents migrants from rural areas and,
on this basis, the opportunity cost of urban (unskilled) labor would be the
same as that for rural (unskilled) labor.
1/ Chambermaids, for example, have been assumed to be unskilled, while
nightclub performers have been assumed to be skilled.
2/ At the same time, employment during the shoulder months (April-May,
September-October) is likely to be somewhat lower in hotels as compared
with the peak months (June, July and August).



ANNEX XI
Appendix 1
Page 3
8.          The efficiency price for unskilled rural labor in Turkey has been
estimated to be 43% of the market wage rate. 1/ This figure has, therefore,
been used to estimate the economic cost of unskilled labor which would be
employed in permanent positions in hotels and related commercial activities.
It is somewhat more difficult, however, to estimate the appropriate efficiency
wage rate for unskilled labor which is employed only during the tourist season,
especially since this period generally coincides with the peak "season" for
agricultural employment, probably the next best alternative. In order to avoid
understating the economic cost of unskilled labor employed seasonally in the pro-
ject, therefore, the efficiency wage rate for these workers has been assumed to
be their market wage rate, adjusted to reflect the world market price of output
foregone (i.e., the market wage rate times the Standard Conversion Factor (SCF)).
9.          Since skilled hotel workers (and commercial employees generally) are
relatively scarce in Turkey, the efficiency wage rate for skilled workers
employed in permanent positions generated by the project has been assumed to
be the market wage rate, adjusted by the SCF. Here also, however, the efficiency
wage rate for seasonally employed skilled workers is more difficult to estimate.
To the extent that these workers might otherwise be employed year round else-
where in Turkey, the appropriate efficiency wage rate would be higher than the
market wage rate.  Two qualifications to this possibility, however, need to be
considered. The first is that the majority of the "skilled" workers in the
Antalya area hotels will have been provided with their skills as a result of
the hotel school included in the project, 2/ or as a result of training programs
carried out by the management of the new hotels.
10.         The second is that the most rapidly expanding need for skilled
hotel employees outside of South Antalya is also likely to be in accommodation
facilities oriented to vacation demand. The alternative employment opportu-
nities, then, for most of the Antalya workers trained by the hotel school would
also involve seasonal work. In view of these qualifications, the efficiency wage
rate for seasonally employed skilled workers in the South Antalya tourism pro-
ject has been assumed to be the market wage rate, adjusted by the SCF.
11.         Taking all of the above factors into account (EWR = 43% of market
wage rate for permanent unskilled workers; EWR = market wage rate times SCF
for all other workers), the weighted average efficiency wage rate would be 75.6%.
1/ Taking into account the value of foregone production in alternative employ-
ment, in terms of its world market price equivalent: EWR = m x a where
(m) is the value of the marginal product of labor in alternative use,
expressed in domestic market prices, and (a) is the conversion factor which
is applied in order to express that marginal product in terms of its world
market price equivalent.
2/ This component has been evaluated separately, rather than included in the
economic rate of return calculations.

of the market wage rate for hotel employees and 73.9% for employees in com-
mercial activities outside of hotels. 1/
Efficiency Price for Land
12.           The master plan for tourism development of the South Antalya
region designates both general zones for different types of economic activity,
and specific sites for hotel development. In the delineation of hotel sites,
the planners have attempted to avoid the disruption of existing agricultural
production. As a result, little if any land set aside for hotels is currently
under cultivation by local farmers or orange growers. Nonetheless, the quality
of this land is not such that other potential uses besides tourism (such as
agriculture) are precluded.
13.           At the present time, however, the market prices for land in the
area do not accurately reflect the value of land in agricultural (or other)
uses. Since the region has been designated as a priority area for tourism
development for several years, the current market prices reflect an element of
speculation. On the basis of discussions in the field, this speculative element
has been estimated very roughly to be 40% of the current market prices. The
efficiency price of land has thus been estimated to be 50% of the market price,
as follows:
Efficiency
Current Market Value          %                   Price %_
in alternative use           60    .82 (SCF) =      49.2
speculative element          40    - 0 -      =     - 0 -
49.2
14.           An example of the way in which the financial investment costs
of the project have been converted into economic investment costs in
efficiency prices, using the conversion factor approach, is attached to
this appendix.
1/ Thus an overall SWR of 75% of the market wage rate was used for all
employees in the hotels and related commercial activities.

TOURIST EXPENDITURES OUTSIDE OF HOTELS
1.          In addition to their expenditures within the hotels, tourists are
also expected to engage in activities outside of the hotels such as excursions
to local points of interest, 1/ shopping for souvenirs, clothing and sundries,
and entertainment, including nightclubs and meals in local restaurants. Based
on the experience of similar resort developments elsewhere which cater to the
market segment likely to be attracted to the Antalya project hotels, the fol-
lowing average amounts per day are expected to be spent outside of hotels by
foreign and domestic tourists: 2/

120.00     8.00               90.00       6.00
2.          Total revenues have been projected on the basis of the estimated
number of bednights (Annex IX) in the resort accommodation facilities, with
foreign tourists assumed to account for 80% of total bednights and domestic
tourists for 20%. Sales taxes, where applicable, are included in the estimated
average daily expenditure figures given above. Since the economic calculations
have been carried out on the basis of an implied effective exchange rate, the
market prices for the above activities have been converted into the equivalent
border prices by applying a conversion factor to domestic tourist expenditures,
while using the official exchange rate to convert foreign tourist expenditures
in US dollars into Turkish lira. 3/ This adjustment, however, has beel calcu-
lated separately for total expenditures of domestic tourists, including hotel
receipts. The analysis given below, therefore, does not show this adjustment.
3.          Operating cost breakdowns for each activity have been estimated on
the basis of financial ratios contained in the project preparation report.
The financial costs, the adjustment factors used to convert them into economic
values in domestic currency, and the corresponding economic costs are indicated
below (as a percentage of sales):
1/ "Excursion" receipts are taken here to include transfers to and from
Antalya Airport for foreign tourists.
2/ Differences in the total amounts reflect both income levels and consumer
interests: domestic tourists are assumed to spend somewhat less on
excursions due to a higher proportion of repeat visitors (and also use
of their own vehicles), while foreign tourists are expected to spend some-
what more on shopping, especially for souvenirs.

a/ Because of the import duty exemption given to establishments which cater

to be roughly equal to the c.i.f. value at the official exchange rate.
The estimated incremental capital/sales ratios in financial and economic terms,
based on the above cost breakdowns, are given below:

5.          The investment cost streams for these activities have been derived
from the projected sales of establishments outside of hotels which, in turn,
are based on projected bednights in the resort accommodation facilities. The
investment required in year x is based on the projected increase in expenditures
in year x + 1, assuming a one-year "construction" period. The investors are
assumed to be entirely local entrepreneurs.
6.          The annual replacement costs for each activity (expressed as a %
of total fixed assets) are based on financial replacement costs and assumed
replacement policies for relevant assets, adjusted by the appropriate conversion
factors to reflect economic costs, as indicated below:

cumulative investment cost streams as described in para. 5. Residual values
have been estimated on the basis of the economic life of various assets, taking
into account replacement cost assumptions.
8.          In order to simplify the computation of costs and benefits relating
to tourist expenditures outside of hotels, several "factors" have been used
which represent weighted averages for the revenues and costs described above,
as follows:

9.          With a 25-year discounting horizon, the above assumptions result
in a discounted cash flow rate of return of 17.6% in financial terms and
54.3% in economic terms. The economic cost/benefit streams have been
incorporated in the overall cost/benefit streams for the project.

TURKEY: SOUTH ANTALYA TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS IMPACT
Foreign Exchange Revenues
1.          The proposed development of resort facilities in South Antalya is
oriented primarily to the foreign, charter-group market and is, therefore,
expected to result in substantial inflows of foreign exchange for the country.
While it is not possible to know in advance the exact proportion of foreign or
domestic bednights that will occur in the resort accommodation facilities, a
reasonable estimate of the likely ratio would range from 75:25 to 85:15. For
purposes of making economic calculations, the proportion assumed is 80:20. On
the basis of the market assumptions described elsewhere in this report, includ-
ing the average daily expenditures for foreign and domestic tourists, the
assumption of 85:15, or 75:25, would not have any significant impact on the
best estimate rate of return. The gross foreign exchange earnings, as shown
in the table attached to this appendix, are based on 80% of total bednights
representing foreign tourists. Revenues (and costs) are in 1975 prices.
Foreign Exchange Costs
2.          The outflows of foreign exchange resulting from the project would
include: (a) the import component of operating costs, and replacement costs,
for hotels and related activities outside of hotels; (b) debt service on the
proposed IBRD loan; and (c) debt service and dividend payments to foreign
loan sources and equity investors in resort hotels and holiday villages. The
assumptions used to estimate these outflows of foreign exchange are indicated
in the following paragraphs.
Import Components
3.          The import components(at c.i.f. value) of hotel operating costs
are relatively low in Turkey, as compared with many other destinations, as
a result of the range of goods and services purchased by hotels which are
poduced locally. The proportion of specific operating costs which is estimated
to be imported is indicated below:

a/ Weighted average.
Debt Service on Proposed IBRD Loan
6.          Since the economic analysis is being carried out in 1975 prices,
the foreign exchange outflow for the proposed loan has been estimated net
of price contingencies (i.e., US$22.0 million x 65%, representing base line
costs). The annual debt service payment, assuming a 25-year loan including
6 years grace period, at 8.5% interest, would be US$1.54 million or TL 23.1
million.
Debt Service and Dividends on Other Foreign Capital
7.          As noted in Appendix 2, the activities outside of hotels are
assumed to be owned (and financed) entirely by local entrepreneurs (and
banks). In the case of hotels and holiday villages, the following assump-
tions have been made regarding source and terms of project financing:
(a)  Debt/Equity Ratio 60:40
(b)  Foreign/local participation in debt financing  20:80
(c)  Foreign/local participation in equity financing  20:80
(d)  Terms of foreign debt capital (in constant prices)
(i)  interest rate  8%
(ii)  grace period  2 years
(iii) repayment period 10 years
(iv) equal annual payments of principal and interest
(e) Dividend rate on foreign equity -- 15% of original
investment paid out as dividends each year after the
third year of operations for any given hotel.
8.          The net balance of payments impact, taking into account all of
the above estimates and assumptions, is shown in the table attached to this
appendix. Since the proposed IBRD loan would cover the estimated foreign
exchange costs of the infrastructure components, and the assumed foreign
capital inflows for hotel investments would be roughly equivalent to the
foreign exchange costs of hotels (20-25%), there would be relatively little



ANNEX XI
Appendix 3
Page 4
impact on the balance of payments as a result of the project investments
themselves. It should be noted, further, that both the gross and net foreign
exchange earnings projected in 1975 prices are likely to be significantly
higher in current prices by the time the project reaches full development in
1991.
Tied Versus United Foreign Capital
9.          As indicated above, about 207. of the investment in hotels is
expected to come from foreign sources. This represents about 147% of the total
investment program, including infrastructure and other superstructure facilities.
To the extent that this foreign capital is untied (i.e., represents a part of
the overall pool of foreign capital which Turkey is able to attract), then no
distinction need be made between the rate of return on the project and the
rate of return on the country's resources invested in the project (since the
country's resources, for which net economic benefits should be maximized,
include both domestic resources and untied foreign capital resources).
10.         To the extent that the foreign capital is tied (i.e., would not
be available to Turkey for any other project), then the cost of the Turkish
economy of this capital is incurred only when it is returned in the form of
debt service and dividend payments; the opportunity cost of the project invest-
ments covered by tied foreign capital would be zero when the investments
(construction) actually take place. If the debt service and dividend payments
are based on interest rates and (DCF) returns to investors which are equivalent
to what the project earns, the internal economic rate of return on domestic
resources is improved simply because of the later timing of the economic cost
of this foreign capital. This improvement would be higher (lower) to the
extent that the debt service and dividend payments reflect lower (higher)rates
of return than that which is earned on the project (because of, for example,
Government corporation taxes).
11.         Assuming that the projected amounts of foreign capital were
entirely tied to this project, and assuming that the debt service and dividend
payments would be made according to the estimates listed in para. 7 (above),
the internal rate of return on domestic resources would be slightly higher
(17.7%) than the return on the project as a whole (17.2%). Obviously the
true situation would lie somewhere between the two extremes of totally tied
and totally untied. Since the impact on the rate of return is relatively
small, however, it is fair to say that the project would be viable for any
reasonable range of assumptions about the proportion of tied foreign capital
available to the project.

TURKEY: SOUTH ANTALYA TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS
Employment in Accommodation Facilities
1.         The direct employment likely to be generated by the resort
hotels and holiday villages in South Antalya has been qstimated on the
basis of an assumed employee per room ratio of 0.875-1/ By the time
these facilities reach their full development (1991), this would imply a
total of 5,031 workers employed directly in hotels.
Employment in Related Commercial Activities
2.         In addition to hotel employment, a substantial number of jobs
will also be created in other commercial activities as a result of the
expenditures of tourists outside of hotels, such as for excursions, shopping,
nightclubs and restaurants (see Appendix 2). Three approaches have been
used to arrive at an estimate of the number of such jobs likely to be
created: a sales/labor ratio; a payroll/labor ratio and capital/labor ratio.
3.         Assuming that the sales/employee ratio outside of hotels might be
roughly the same as for hotels (TL 100,000 per employee), the projected total
sales of excursions, shops, nightclubs and restaurants was divided by
TL 100,000 to estimate the resulting employment. In the year when full
development was reached (1991), this implied a total of 1,961 employees.
4.         Assuming (roughly) that the average wage per worker outside of
hotels would be TL 20,000 per year, the projected total payroll for commercial
activities outside of hotels was divided by that amount to estimate the result-
ing employment. In the year when full development was reached (1991), this
implied a total of 1,941 employees.
5.         Assuming an average investment per worker of TL 112,500 (US$7,500)
for excursions, TL 45,000 (US$3,000) for shops, and TL 60,000 (US$4,000) for
nightclubs and restaurants, the assumed weighted average investment cost per
job outside of hotels would be TL 71,250 (US$4,750).2! Thus the investment
cost outside of hotels was divided by TL 71,250 to estimate the resulting
employment. In the year when full employment was reached (1991), this implied
a total of 1,927 employees.
1/ Based on a weighted average employee per room ratio for various categories
of accommodation, in line with experience of similar hotels elsewhere in
Turkey.
2/ This compares with about TL 186,500 (US$12,430) in hotels. It should be
noted, however, that the economic life of hotel capital is considerabl-y
longer than for most commercial activities outside of hotels--implying a
lower "long term" investment per worker than US$12,430.



ANNEX XI
Appendix 4
Page 2
6.         Given the consistency of employment estimates using each of
these approaches, it is fairly safe to assume that about 1,950 workers
would be employed outside of hotels by the time the project reaches full
development.
National Park (Camping) Employment
7.         The expenditures in the National Park by campers and day-beach
users would generate employment of guides, park rangers, attendants and
catering personnel. These activities would imply a significantly lower
employee/sales ratio than that assumed for employees of hotels and related
commercial activities. A rough (and conservative) estimate of 0.25 employees
per TL 100,000 in sales has therefore been used to estimate the number of
National Park jobs created.l/ On this basis, the number of such jobs would
be 223 by the time full development is reached.
Construction Industry Employment
8.         In addition to the infrastructure components which would be fi-
nanced in part by the proposed IBRD loan, a considerable amount of addi-
tional construction would be required in order to develop the hotel facilities
and other commercial activities envisaged for South Antalya. While the first
five years of project implementation would be the more intensive period of
construction, a substantial amount of further construction would continue for
the following nine years as well. Assuming that roughly 20% of investment
costs represent payroll, and that the average wage per construction worker
would be TL 20,000, the average number of construction workers employed in
South Antalya as a result of the project would be 1,690 per year for the
first five years (1976-80) and 613 per year for the following nine years.
Indirect employment
9.         The employment creation described above would be a direct result
of the tourism investments proposed (or projected) for the South Antalya
area. At the same time, however, the project would stimulate the creation
of additional employment in related sectors which supply goods and services
for tourists only indirectly, through the hotels, shops and other activities
on which tourists spend their money.Z! The primary focus of this indirect
employment effect would be in handicraft production, agriculture, food process-
ing, furniture production (and related hotel requirements), transportation and
distribution.
1/ This is 1/4 the ratio for commercial activities outside of hotels.
2/ Note: This does not refer to the employment multiplier effect which
involves jobs created as a result of higher incomes (and consumption)
by the local population as a result of the project.



ANNEX XI
Appendix 4
Page 3
10.        While the level of indirect employment is difficult to estimate,
a few rough calculations can provide a useful guide as to its likely (order-
of-magnitude) significance. Consider, for example, the sale of handicrafts
and souvenirs in the resort area shops. The indirect employment created
for handicraft workers and artisans might be estimated on the basis of the
following assumptions:
(a)  Sales of Shops         =           100%
(b)  Cost of Goods SoldL/
(gross income to handicraft
workers)                           54%
(c) Value added by handicraft
workers (as % of their
income from sales to shops)         65%
(d) Average net income per handi-
craft worker -- say                TL 20,000
11.        In the year in which full development is reached (1991), the sales
of shops amount to TL 72.6 million. The gross income to handicraft workers
would thus be TL 39.2 million, and the net income would be TL 25.5 million.
Dividing by TL 20,000, the average income per worker, would indicate the
creation of about 1,275 new jobs in the handicraft sector. This represents
about 18% of the total jobs created by that year directly in hotels and other
commercial activities (excluding construction).
12.        On the basis of the above analysis for handicraft workers, it
would not be unreasonable to assume that the total indirect employment likely
to be generated by the project might be in the order of about 75% of the
direct employment, and possibly even higher. On the basis of the assumptions
described above for direct employment creation, and assuming an additional
0.75 indirect jobs for each direct job (excluding construction), the total
number of jobs estimated to be created by the project in each year is shown
in the Table attached to this Appendix.
1/ See Appendix 2, page 2.

THE MINISTRY OF TOURISM AND INFORMATION (MTI)
TOURISM BANK, INC. (TBI)
1.          MTI was created in the early 1960s but started to work effec-
tively only in 1971 when the State Planning Organization (SPO) relinquished
its planning function for tourism development on a regional scale to the
Ministry. Its major functions at the present time are:
(a) setting tourism development targets;
(b) shaping tourism policies;
(c) preparing regional tourism development plans
and making proposals for their implementation;
(d) marketing and promoting Turkey's image in the
international tourism market;
(e) coordinating policies and planning activities
with other Government agencies and private
interests; and
(f) supervising the operations of the Tourism
Bank, Inc..
Organization and Staffing
2.          The Ministry is divided into seven departments (Chart 1),
provincial offices, offices in foreign countries and support offices. The
seven departments are:
(a) the General Directorate of Tourism which covers
the coordination of iourism superstructure
investments and control of all touristic services;
(b) the General Directorate of Information which is
responsible for marketing and promotion;
(c) the Planning Department which takes care of
tourism development plans and sectoral public
investments programs;



ANNEX XII
Page 2
(d) the Department of Research and Appraisal
which is responsible for tourism studies and
statistics;
(e) the Department of Training;
(f) the Department of Organization; and
(g)  the Department of International Relations.
Policies and Practices
3.          In carrying out its general and physical planning functions,
MTI liaises with the SPO, which prepares the five-year development plans.
Working within the framework of the development plans, it then prepares
master plans of selected tourism regions and the physical plans for priority
development sites; it then submits these plans to the Ministry of Recon-
struction and Resettlement, who authorizes implementation. Implementation
is undertaken with the cooperation of Government agencies such as the
Ministry of Public Works; Post, Telephone, Telecommunications (PTT); and
Municipalities. Once the investment proposals are drawn up, they are then
submitted to the SPO for approval, fund allocation and inclusion in the
annual programs. The execution of infrastructure projects is normally
undertaken by the provincial offices of the Ministries concerned. The
Ministry also classifies hotels which seek official registration, and
approves tariffs and tariff increases.
4.          Expenditures on tourism promotion outside Turkey amount to about
US$700,000 a year, representing the cost of advertising and propaganda
materials, but excluding administration costs of overseas operations.
While the Government is aware that the sum is inadequate, it does not want
to expand promotion because of the limited availability of accommodation.
It is, however, considering a larger fund allocation, once room capacity
has been increased.
The Tourism Bank, Inc. (TBI)
5.          TBI was established in 1960 and assumed its present form as
the result of a reorganization in 1972, when its headquarters were moved
from Istanbul to Ankara. The Treasury has 51% of the authorized share
capital, a number of public shareholders have 39% and 10% is private. The
Bank functions under private law and has a broad charter which enables it
to engage in (a) "functions related to tourism" including leasing, selling,
constructing, owning and operating tourism related facilities; and
(b) banking operations, including issuing short-, medium- and long-term
credit for tourism, accepting deposits to facilitate social tourism and
issuing bonds. TBI also implicitly acts as a catalyst for tourism develop-
ment in areas where the Government feels that pilot projects are necessary
to stimulate further investment in tourism.

6.          TBI is a State Economic Enterprise which reports to the Ministry
of Tourism. Its board of directors is composed of the general director,
the two assistant general directors and two outside directors appointed by
the Government. TBI has a staff of 170, including about 70 professionals.
The two assistant general directors share responsibility for day-to-day
operation of TBI (Chart 2); one assistant general director covers project
appraisal, planning, budgeting, research, technical work, operations and
joint ventures, whnile the other is responsible for accounting, credit, per-
sonnel administration and supplies. The legal department functions indepen-
dently of the operating departments and the legal adviser reports directly
to the general director.
7.          Until now .TBI has functioned more as a general tourism development
organization than as a Bank. Its main operations consist of hotel credit,
hotel ownership/management and development of tourism accommodations.
8.          In the period 1971-1974, TBI financed a total of 109 tourism
operations (mostly hotels) with a loan value of TL 265.8 million. Although
TBI is legally entitled to borrow and to issue bonds, it has not done so
because of high interest rates. Its sources of funds have been annual
budgetary allocations from the Treasury. TBI issues short-, medium- and
long-term credit for hotels, boarding houses, handicrafts and tourism-
related activities. The terms of its loans are determined in an annual
credit policy statement and vary as to purpose and geographical location.
They can be summarized as follows:
Interest                             Term
Rate      Grace Period        Including Grace
Long-term
(construction)        8.0       up to 3 years       up to 15 years
Medium-term
(equipment)           8.0       up to 2 years       up to 8 years
Short-term
(working capital)   11.5        up to 1 year        up to 2 years
Normally a maximum of 60% of project cost is financed, prorated between con-
struction and equipment. TBI's interest rates are substantially below
market rates in Turkey and do not reflect inflation; the terms, however,
are fairly short for hotel credit.
9.          TBI is one of the biggest hotel operating companies in Turkey.
Its hotel operations include two vacation villages, 3 resort hotels, a city
hotel and a vacation complex, with a total capacity of 1,646 beds in 769
rooms. In 1974, the hotels had a net loss of TL 3.7 million on revenues



ANNEX XII
Page 4
of TL 30.5 million. Average seasonal bed occupancy was 53% in 1974, but
reportedly increased substantially in 1975.
10.         TBI's activities in developing tourism accommodations increased
rapidly over the last few years. At the end of 1975, 35 engineers and
architects were working in the technical department. During 1974 and 1975
this department designed and/or supervised construction of two hotels in
Cesme and Antalya with a total of 250 rooms, and of three holiday villages
at Kilyos, Akcay and Marmaris with all the infrastructure and with a total
of 192 rooms and 200 bungalows. In 1975 the department was also charged by
the MTI with the design and supervision of the restoration of ancient
quarters in Istanbul.
