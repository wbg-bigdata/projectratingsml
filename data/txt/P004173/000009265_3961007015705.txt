ON A PROPOSBD OAW  TO TUM R8EDLIC OF KORUA
FOR A PORTS    UmyUI' IND          1           ImPROVuhNT PROJOCT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of US$100 million
to help finance a project designed to improve the environmental conditions in the
Korea,s coastal and marine waters and City of Pusan. The loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including
5 years of grace. The proceeds of the loan will be onlent to Korea Maritime and
Port Administration (KMPA) and Korea Container Terminal Authority (RCTA) at the
same rates as the Bank loan.
2.         B                Despite  substantial  investment  in  transport
infrastructure and relatively efficient operations by international standards,
rapid economic growth in Korea has outpaced the expansion of transport capacity.
This is especially true in the port subsector which has been crucial to Korea's
economic growth.  Since 1980, cargo volum  has increased at an annual rate of
about 10% with the result that Korea's ports, especially Pusan, one of the
largest container ports in the world, suffer from serious port congestion. In
1992, 4.3% of the ships entering the Port of Pusan experienced an average waiting
time of 44 hours which resulted in large economic costs to the country. In
response, the New Five Year Economic Plan (1993-97) emphasises, among other
things, specific investment and policy initiatives designed to increase the
freight handling capacity and the level of private sector financing for new port
facilities. In order to alleviate the inadequate container handling capacity,
a new container terminal will be constructed at Pusan and a new container port
will be constructed, with private sector financing, at Kwangyang Day (without
Bank financing). Priority will also be given to addressing marine, coastal and
urban environmmntal issues by expanding pollution control facilities and
improving port operations.
3.         The growth of port activity and the planning of new capacity have
raised serious environmental concerns. The first concern is how to build new
capacity without exacerbating conditions in the associated urban areas like Pusan
where rapid urbanization and industrial development combined with inadequate
protection c - the environment have resulted in the rapid degradation of the
environmental conditions. The second concern is how to manage the quality of
coastal waters by stopping the dumping of ship wastes. A third concern is how
to protect against i-he rising likelihood of accidents in coastal waters with the
increased traffic. The proposed project ls designed to address these issues and
represents an appropriate conclusion to the Bank' s long involvement in the Korean
ports subsector.
4.         Prolect Objectives. The primary objectives of the proposed project
are to help address the major environmental concerns in Korean maritime
transport, to reduce the level of noise, air pollution and traffic congestion in
the City of Pusan, and to strengthen the RMPA capaclty to deal with environmental
issues during port development and operation.
5.         Proiect Descerition. The proposed project, to be implemented over the
period from 1994-99, consists of the following components:
a. Construction of the Port of Dadaeno. A nine-berth port complex will
be constructed at Dadaepo on the outskirts of the City of Pusan by KMPA for the
handling of timber and marine products and other general cargo. The port will
have an estimated annual cargo handling capacity of four million tons. The loan
will assist URMA in financing the construction of the breakwater and the dredging



-2-
and preparation of the channel estimated to cost US$1S8 million.  RNPA is
considering financing the reclamation and const-iction costg for the wharves and
the adjacent industrial ccmplex, estimated to cost US$337 million through a joint
venture, established by the various private companies that will relocate their
existing industrial operations from the center of Pusan to Dadaepo. The complex
will provide space to remove environmentally conflicting land uses from the
center of Pusan, and the site that was selected will avoid a local bird
sanctuary. The estimated cost of the port cum industrial complex is US$505.7
million (46% of total project costs).
b.  Shi  Waste  Disposal  Facilities.    The  loan will  finance  the
construction of facilities for the collection, storage, treabtent and disposal
of ship wastes covered by the Annexes to the RARPOL convention signed by Korea.
The establishment of these ship waste disposal facilities will be on a priority
basis at strategically located *hub' ports along the Korean coast in order to
efficiently serve all of the ports in Korea.   Since the majority of waste
material is produced by smaller coastal vessels, this hub" system will be
developed at moderate sized ports around the country. The estimated cost of these
facilities is US$15 million (1% of total project costs).
c. Vessel Traffic Manaaement System (VTWS). The loan will finance the
development and installation of a traffic management system to monitor, regulate
and control the movement of vessels.  The system will be installed in the Ports
of Pusan, Inchon and Asan on a pilot basis. When the system has been tested, it
will be replicated at other ports as the budget permits. The system would reduce
ship accidents, increase the safety of navigation, and help improve the
environmental conditions in Korean waters. The estimated cost of the system for
these three ports is US$25 million (2% of total project costs).
d. Development of the Container Facilities. KCTA is constructing four
container berths, originAlly designed as common user berths with a designed
capacity of 1,200,000 TEUs, in Pusan (Phase IV Terminal) with local funds. Each
of the berths will be a self contained operating unit with its own supporting
container stacking area, container freight station, maintenance shop and terminal
office. The berths will be capable of accommodating vessels up to 50,000 DWT.
This will be the last phase of container berth development in Pusan.  Upon
completion, the berths will be leased to private terminal operators. Rach of the
four container berths being constructed in Pusan is to be equipped with two quay
side container cranes.  The loan will help finance the procurement of these
container cranes estimated to cost about US$40 million with the entire facility
estimated to cost US$558 million (50% of total project costs).
e.  Technical Assistance and Training:  (i) Yellow Sea Lar.e Marine
Ecosystem (LIE).   The program will focus on monitoring pollution, ecosystem
productivity, biodiversity and changes in yields of living marine resources. The
loan will finance the proeision of monitoring equipment and training (US$2.2
million); (ii) Ship Waste Disposal Facilities. Technical assistance will be
provided to complete the designs and evaluate the policies and strategies
relating to the collection, storage, treatment and disposal of ship wastes
(US$0.4 million). Advanced procurement in the amount of US$200,000 has been
agreed in order to finance consult.ng services, (iii) Environmental frainino.
The knowledge of RMPA staff on environmental aspects of port development,
construction and operation will be upgraded in the project (US$0.7 million);
(iv)  ODerational  and Technical  Trainina.   Fifty  (50) person months of
professional training will be financed to further develop the skills of the
engineering and operational staff of RMPA (US$0.4 million); and (v) Institutional
Development.  Initiatives will be pursuted with local financing and monitored by
the Bank tos (a) develop a system to privatize the multi-purpose terminals at all
27 international ports, (b) develop an improved system of performance agreements
between KNPA, KCTA and the various terminal operating companies, (c) develop the
means within KRPA to better manage and coordinate the maritime environmental



^_3_
improvement program; and (d) prepare standard operating procedures and
engineering designs to be used to retrofit existing port facilities to minimize
the pollution caused by port operations.
6.         Project Imnlementation. KCTA will be responsible for the development
of the container terminal and the Bank-financed cargo handling equipment, and
MOST and KORDI wi}l be responsible for the Yellow Sea LME program.   All of the
other project components will be the responsibility of KMPA.
7.         Protect Cost and Financing,  The total project cost is estimated to
be about US$1106.96 million equivalent, including physical and price
contingencies.  This includes a foreign exchange component of US$314.02 million,
or about 28% of the total cost. A summary of project coats by component and the
financing plan is shown in Schedule A.   The Bank loan of US$100 million,
representing about 9.0% of the total project cost or about 3i.83% of the foreign
exchange cost, will be made to the Government and will be u3ed to finance the
foreign exchange cost of the breakwater at Dadaepo, the procurement of equipment
for the reception and treatment of ship wastes, the VTIS, and container quay
cranes for Pusan Phase IV and the provision of technical assistance and training.
Retroactive financing amounting to US$0.2 mil'4on would be provided to meet the
cost of consulting services for the feasibilT-' and detailed engineering of the
ship waste disposal  facilities.   Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.   A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Korea are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively. Three maps
showing the project areas in Pusan are also attached.   The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 12998-KO, dated August 12, 1994, is being distributed separately.
8.         Protect Sustainabilitv.  The construction of the Port and industrial
c-mplex at Dadaepo is sustainable because the industrial complex will encourage
t.&e relocation of companies requiring nearby port facilities, and the low cost
of the reclaimed land and reduced transportation coats will provide a strong
economic incentive for companies to relocate to the complex. In addition, the
increased port capacity is needed in the Pusan area to handle the levels of
forecasted traffic. The investment in the container handling equipment for Pusan
is sustainable due to the demand for additional container handling capacity. In
both cases, the responsible agency is also very experienced and capable of
implementing projects of this nature.
9.         Lessons from Previous Bank Loans.  Four PCRs were prepared for Bank
financed transport projects in FY92-93. Each PCR,(one being for the Third Pusan
Port Project) identified issues specific to the project concerned, but there were
also several common findings such as: (a) KMPA (and the other agencies) need to
become more sensitive to both the social and environmental impacts of their
projects; (b) investments '.n transportation tend to be based as much on social
as they are on economic need, and capital investments are more popular
politically than efforts to improve institutional efficiency, and (c) the
Government needs to explore new sources of financing in order to construct the
new transport infrastructure required to support the projected economic growth.
The lessons learned from past, as well as ongoing, projects have been
incorporated into this project by insuring that the capital investments were
critical and phased to insure a high first year rate of return, and that the
environmental and social aspects of the project have been thoroughly prepared and
a monitoring plan put in place. The Government is far more aware of the need to
protect the environment than it was five years ago, and the political situation
has also increased the Government's sensitivity to social issues. The
environmental and social issues have been addressed in two separate EA reports
and in a resettlement plan required by government regulations. Private sector
financing is being used to finance the construction of the industrial and port
facilities at Dadaspo and at Kwangyang Bay. Bank recommendations, during project



-4
preparation, relating to the financial arrangements for these ports have been
taken into account.
10.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The project was specifically
mentioned in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board on
December 23, 1993.  The Bank's involvement is a natural progression of its
contribution to the development of Korea's port system and meets the goal of
ensuring the incorporation of environmental considerations, technology transfer
and institutional reform in the development of transport infrastructure. Through
the project, the Bank would provide comprehensive support for environmental
issues in port and harbor development as illustrated through the site selection
process and economic evaluation of the Dadaepo Port, the focus on compliance with
the MARPOL convention, the approach to vessel traffic safety and the c.ncern for
the ecosystem of the Yellow Sea.
11.        Actions Aareed On.  During negotiations, agreements were obtained
that: (a) no disbursements will be made with respect to the Dadaepo component
until KMPA provides the Bank with satisfactory evidence that the NA for Dadaepo
has been approved by MOB: (b) the resettlement for the industrial complex at
Dadaepo will be carried out in accordance with the following principles and
objectives set forth in the Bank's policy (OD 4.30)s that the people shall be
consulted and participate in the design and implementation of the resettlement
activities, and that at least 30 days prior to their displacement, each affected
person shall be provided with a compensation package, in cash or in kind,
sufficient to insure that each affected psrson shall improve or at least regain,
the standard of living and means of livelihood that they were enjoying prior to
their displacement.   In addition, each compensation package shall include
compensation for the assets lost, at replacement costs, and adequate subsistence
allowance during the transition period or resettlement, (c) KMPA and KCTA would
be required to submit to the Bank the environmental monitoring results/reports
which are required by MOE for both Dadaepo and the new container terminal; (d)
KMPA and KCTA should each generate sufficient cash from operations so that when
combined with the cash and short-term securities on hand at Jaauary 1 of the year
the total represents not less than 20% of the average annual capital expenditures
for that year and the next for RMPA and 40% for KCTA; and (e) RMPA should submit
a proposal to the Bank identifying the participants and program for the extended
studies portion ef the training program no later than November 1 of the year
preceding the training.
12.        Envirosmental Aspects. The environment category for the project is
A since it .nvolves the construction of two new port facilities and an industrial
complex all of which require dredging and reclamation. Tne industrial facility
at Dadaepo will generate some noise, air pollution and waste water.   An
environmental impact statement has been prepared for the new Port of Dadaepo
after an analysis of alternative sites.   This report also includes an
environmental analysis for the industrial facility. An environmental impact
statement was also prepared for the construction of a new container terminal in
Pusan. Executive summaries of the two EAs have been submitted to and accepted
by the Bank. The Government will also develop a management and monitoring plan
to control the above environmental issues. As part of the review of the EAs, the
local population and NGOS had access to the reports and provided comments to the
Ministry of Environment.
13.        Proaram Objective Cateaocries. This project does not directly relate
to the reduction of poverty, but it does contribute to environmentally
sustainable development of the maritime sector and improvement of Pusan's urban
environment.
14.        Participatorv Anoroach.  Several meetings were organized by RMPA and
the City of Pusan to discuss the Dadaepo component with local residents and
businessmen. The comments received from these meetings were incorporated in the



-5-
design of the project. Local and iAternational NGOs were also invited to attend
these meetings, but none attended or FbMItted any written comments.   The
environmental assessment was also made available to the public in accordance with
Korean law.
15.        Prject penafits.  The most sigpificant benefits to the project are
those related to envirormental Improvements in the City of Pusan. The relocation
of about 130 timber processing amI 107 fish processing plants from mixed
residential areas to Vadaepo will reduce truck traffic and replace polluting
industrial facilities with residential development. The construction of the new
container terminal in Pusan will also have a positive impact on the City's
environment by limiting the need for and use of many of the existing off-dock
container yards located throughout the City and the resulting truck traffic.
Additional benefits relate to the improved marine environmental conditiona
resulting from collecting ships' wastes and the reduction in oil spills due to
ship accidents.
16.        Risks.   The main project risks concern policy decisions to be
implemented, includings (i) enforcement of the relocation of the timber and fish
processing plants to Dadaspo as well as some of the off-dock container yards from
the city's residential areas to on-dock facilities and XcD facilities, and the
re-zoning of these vacated areas to exclude future industrial development, and
(ii) private participation in the financing of both the Dadaepo and Kwangyang Bay
facilities. The impact of those risks on the project are not expected to be very
great or to reduce the likelihood of achieving its anticipated benefits. The
Pusan Government has clearly stated its intention to transfer industrial
operations, including timber and fish processing plants and the off-dock
container yards, to areas designated as industrial and away from areas zoned for
residential and commercial activities. The implementation of this policy has
been delayed due to the lack of suitable sites to properly accommodate these
operations, but with the expanded space for the bandling of cntainer traffic
with the Phase IV development, the new SCD at Yangsan and the new industrial
space being developed at Dadaepo, sufficient land will now be available to
implement stated policLes.
17.        The risk that the private operators will not be able to finance the
reclamation of the land at Dadaepo does not appear to be a concern.  The
operators involved in the move have formed a promotion committee to manage the
reclamation and construction. The costs will be financed by the compenies that
have been selected to move to the Dadaepo site.   If some of the selected
companies prove to be incapable of financing their share of the cost, there are
many other companies willing to replace thm who would have the necessary funds
in order to participate in an investment with such high rates of return. The risk
associated with the financing of the new container berths at Kwangyang Bay also
does not appear to be a concern since bids on three of the four berths have
already been accepted and KCTA is reporting a strong international interest in
the fourth berth.
18.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that-the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Dank and recommend that the Bxecutive
Directors approve it.
