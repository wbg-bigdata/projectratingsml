A. Introduction
1.          Pusan is the second largest city in Korea with a population of about
4 million and its port ig Xoreas largest international port and also the sixth
largest in the world. Due to ri-ing incomes and population growth and the city -
geographic constraints, extremely high urban traffic densLties and *nvironmental
deterioration have resulted. Pusan is also important for a large number of timber
and marine-product proc.sring industries, which are scattered Ln the residential
and comercial areas of Pusan city, compounding the pollution and traffic
problems through frequent transportation acceas to the port. It iu the
Governmant s policy to improve the economic efficiency of theme industries as
well an alleviate traffic congestion, and optimize environmental quality and road
safety in the city of Pusan by developing a new port facility in an area outside
the urban core and relocating these industries to that site.
2.          Accordingly, it is proposed that: (i) a new port facility capable of
accommodating 5,000-50,000 DWT ships be constructed at Dadaepo which is located
about 10 km to the mouth west of the city center; and (ii) an industrial complex
for moving the exiating, scattered timber and marine-product processing
industries be constructed at this site on reclaimed land. The total cost of the
Dadampo investment in about USSSO4 million of which USS53 million would be
provided by the Bank. The Korea Maritime and Port Administration (XHPA) io the
-esponsible agency and the project will be carrLed out during 1995-1999. It is
expected that: (i) XHPA would invest in the construction of breakwaters and
dredging of ship channel; and (ii) the private sector would invest in the
construction of wharf and reclamation, including seawalls, and in the development
of industrial complex.
3.          In Xorea,  an environmental impact assessment  (ElA)  for port
construction and development of the industrial complex is required by the Basic
Environmental Quality Law (BEQA). The E;A is re.uired to comply with the
guidelines provided by the MiniLtry of Environment (IOE) and public consultation
is a mandatory requlrement. The implementing agency L responsible for the
preparation of the EIA and for implementation of the mitigation measurs and the
monitoring program. HOE is responsible for review and approval of the ElA and
perLodic monitoring of its compliance. The penalty for noncompliance may result
in 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine of VS million.
4.          The EIA for this component was carried out as part of the feasibility
Oad basic design (FS/BD) study by KMPA with assistanCe from a group of local
consultants: Daewoo Enginoering Company; Woobo Engineering Company; Hanyang
University; Pusan University; and the Korea Institute of science and Technology.
Pollowing HOE s guidelines, the ElI report presented the existing conditions of
the project site and the nearby area; assessed the potential Lpact during
construction and operation of the project; identified the mitigation measuresj
and proposed a management and monitoring program. The draft report was submitted
to WOE in October 1993 for a preliminary review and public consultation was
undertaken according to the Korean law. The project was announced publicly
through newspapers and public notices, and the EIA report was exhibited for
public reviow and comment for 20 days. The results of the consultation were
considered during the preparation of the final report and the comeznts and
opinions of the individual and concerned agencies were docunmented in the report.
The final report has been submitted to MOE in March 1994 and its approval i$



2
expected by May 1994. The report has concluded that the project is needed to
sustain economic development and to alleviate the existing traffic and land use
problems in Puman, but implementation of the proposed mitigation measures is
necessary to minimize the potential negative impacts. Results of thn
environmental study are briefly describad in the following sections.
B. Description of this Component
5.          The main objective of this component is to construct a 9-berth port
for 5.000-50,000 DWT ships on reclaimed land in a cove at Dadaspo Bay and to
develop an industrial complex for the relocation of timber and marine-product
processing industries from Pusan city. The activities comprisez (a) dredging of
the shipping channel and berthing site and construction of breakwateror (b)
reclamation of about 1,623,000 n2 of land from the sea and construction of
berthing facility; and (c) relocation and development of timber and marine-
product processing industries wlth adequate protection of the envlroncnt.
Description of these activities are sumiarized in the following paragraphs.
6.          The proposed site is located near the tip of Dadaepo peninsula
(Pigure 1). The port is situated along the eastern side of the peninsula near the
Mouth of Dadaepo Bay, and the industrial complex extends towards the weat end
near the boundary of the Nakdong preservation area. Figare 2 shows the industrial
complex area and the proposed land use. The total area is about 1,6B7,000 .2 of
which 96.2% will be reclaimd from the sea. Of the total area, about 65% will be
allocated for timber processing factories and storage yard, 22% for marine-
product processing factories, 8% for Hanjin heavy industry, and 5% for green
areas and other public facilities. A 2,160 m long seawall will be buLlt along the
boundary of the Nakdong preservation area. The level of reclamation will be about
3.26 m above mean sea level.
7.          Along the east side the port, berthing facilities will be constructed
near the mouth of Dadaepo Bay. The main facilities include a 1,940 m quay, a 500
a seawall, a 900 m southern breakwater, a 180 m eastern breakwater, and a ship
channel of 300 m wide, 11.5-14.5 m deep, and a turning basin of 45D m in
diameter. About 900,000 .3 of bottom sediment will be dredged and disposed of
due to its weak characteristics which are not suitable for use in reclamation.
It in expected that part of the dredged materials will be used an landfill for
other development areas in Pusan and the remaining will be disposed of at the
site located about 13 km offshore in an area designated as the sea disposal site
by MOE (see Figure 3).
8.          About 9S0,000 m3 of rocks; 1.65 million m3 of soll; and 9.05 million
.3 of sand will be required for construction of the breakwaters and reclamtion.
The rock and soil will be obtained from the demolition of the Kuen Sol mountain
and the small Lsland which are located in the proposed site. The remaining amount
will be acquired and transported by trucks from the nearby quarry sites (Figure
3). The sea sand will be acquired from an area offshore of the Nakdong river
mouth about 3 km from the proposed site. An access road will be built in the sits
(7.5% of the total site ar-ea) to provide direct transportation of products from
the port and industrial complex to the existing road network.
C. Base Line Conditions
9.          Natural Eaviroment. The proposed site is located in Saha district
(gu) and is surrounded by mountains and the sa-. Figure 4 shows the *xisting
conditlon at the proposed site and nearby area. Along the west coast, a sandy
boach exists but its use for recreation has been prohibited due to water
pollution. A shallow tidal flat in being used for fishery purposes. The Holundae
mountain located in the south is designated as a military reatricted area and is
still very rich in trees and vegetation. Seaweed and other marine culture areas
are scattered in the southern sea area where water depth is relatively high (10-
17 mi. To the east, is Dadaepo Bay which is being used for port and industrial



3
activities. A fishing port, inc:uding two breakwaters, in located at the head of
the bay. The water depth varies greatly (0-14 m) from the head to the mouth wLth
a slope of 1/80-1/40. The total surface water area Is 5 km2 and the bottom *s-
bed comprises clay and sandy silt with a wide distribution of rocks near the
mountain areas and Dusongsan peninsula. Reclamatlon is being carried out in two
areas along the east coast of the bay by the prlvate sector for industrial
purposes.
10.         Land and marine ecology surveys were carried out during 1992-93.
Distribution of plants and animals was surveyed and a greenery number was
assigned. The net productivity was 19,436 t/yr. Near the mouth of Nakdong River,
about 17,000 birds of 33 species were observed from the four surveys which were
made during the study period and the predominant species were wild duck and gull
(Tebl- 1). Historical data on species and numbers of the migratory birds which
were collected under other studies are shown in Figure 5 and Table 2. It is
believed that more birds have moved from the Nakdong River Mouth area to the
freshwater reservoirs (Dongpan and Junam) located in the north of Pusan. The
number of migrants had reached a 100,000 level in the early 1980., and decreased
sharply thereafter. For marine ecology study Isee locations in Figure 6) , species
and number of phytoplankton, zooplankton, large benthos, seaweeds, and fishes
were reported.
11.         A study on water flow characterlstics, lncluding sediment transport,
and water quality Ln Dada-po area was carried out during July 1992-October 1993
(Figure 6). In Nakdong River, the mean sea level was 75.4 cm and the mean tidal
range was 93.5 cm whlle those in the Dadaepa Bay were 73.8 cm and 89.2 cm
respectively. The interval of high tide in the two areas was about 8 hours. The
current speed In the southern sea ranged from 4-30 cm/sec. The results of water
quality analysis obtained from 4 surveys (sable 3) indicated relatively high
concentrations of nitrogen (T-N) and phosphorus (T-P), oil/grease (n-hexans),
lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), copper (cu), and cadmium (Cd) compared to the standards of
class III suitable for port and industrial uses. Wide seasonal variation of T-N
was observed in which the lowest value occurred in winter (December 1992) and the
highest one occurred in spring (April 1993)- Seasonal variation of T-P was much
smaller and the highest value occurred in spring and the lowest value occurred
in winter. The levels of chemical oxygen demand (COD) were 2-3 mg/l compared to
the standard of not more than 4.0 mg/l. The levels of suspended solids (SS)
ranged from 4.5-19.0 mg/1 and no significant levels of mercury (Hg), arsenic
(AseI  chromium (Cr+6), and cyanide (CM) were detected in the water samples.
Analysis of heavy metals in the bottom sediment taken from Dadaepo Bay Is shown
Ln Table 4.
12.         Living Environment   Pusan City Is a mountaiLnous area where land
avaiLability for development is very limited. An of 1991, total land area of
Pusan City is 647 kc2 of which about 58% was natural area, 22% was used for
development (14.5% residential, 2.51 commercial, 5.1% industrial), and 20% was
non-classifi ed land. rigur 7 shows the existing locations of timber and marine-
product processing lndustries in Pusan City. Most of them are located in the old
areas where with mixed land uses for residential and Lndustrlal. Availability of
land for expansion and/or improving of safety and control of pollution and other
nuisance is limited. In Saha district, the total land area is 36.8 Im2 of whLch
23% was industrial, 17% wam residential, 1t was conmercial, and 59% was greenery.
As shown in Figure 4, a few large industries and most of the residential areas
are located in the northern part of the proposed site.
13.         In September 1992 and February 1993, air quality (S02, CO, N02, TSP,
03, HCs, Pb) and noise masurements were carried out at 3 stations located near
the proposed site, an industrial area, and a residential area (Figure B). The air
quality results (Table 5) showed that the level of suspended particulate (Tsp)
at the station near the proposed site exceeded the standards. This situation was
expected to be temporary due to the on-going construction of a housing project
in the area. Noie levels at the residential area exceeded the standards.

14.         Regarding wast-es, an of 1990, the amount of waste qeneration ln Pusan
City was 8,500 t/d (3.1 million t/y) of which 61% was combustLble, 36% was non-
combustible, and 3% was reusable. About 31% of the total amount (950,205 t/y) was
industrial waste of which 85% (805,484 t/y) was general waste and 15S% (144,721
t/y) was specified waste. of the specif led wante, 3.4% was toxic, 9. 2% was wants
oil, 37.7% was plastics, and 49.6% was acid and alkaline. Generation of night-
soll in the city was about 3,912 m3/d. In Saha district, waste generation was
about 550 t/d. Most of these wastes have been collected and d-spo-ed of at the
Elcuk manLtary landfill. Capacity of this landfill is expected to be full by the
end of 1994. The city is implementing a plan to develop a new sanitary landfill
of 11,570,000 m3 capacity at Sang Guk Dong, Rang Seo Gu.
15.         Socio-tconomics. In 1991, Pusan I population density was about 7,713
parson/km2  and the house-ownership rate was in excess of 50%.   Vehlcle
registration has increased by almost 370% since 1980. The work force was about
60% of the population and tended to increase every year, while the unemployment
rate decreased signLifcantly. The industrial structure Ln Pusan comprises mainly
comeerce, service, and small enterprises of labor-concentrated light industry.
Tertiary industry, including port industries and services, is a major user of the
labor force  and is  important for the city economy. In Saha distrLet the
population was about 348,000 (9A of total city population), an increase of 5.4%
from that of 1989. The house-ownership rate was 57%  characterized mainly by
single family houses. There are about 87,750 housing units, averaging 3.9 persons
per unlt. Several industrial areas are located In Saha district occupying an area
of 8.47 kc2 and accomnodating about 800 manufacturing firms.
16.         Road, railway, and sea transport are important for sustaining the
clty and national economy. rigure 9 shows the existing road network in Pusan and
traffic conditions in the project area.   The  xpressways in the City are
Ssoyongro, Nakdongdaero, Kayaro, Sasangro, and Kandukro. The designed capacities
Of these roads ranged from 2.2S0-6,600 PCU/hr and the service quality (V/C)
ranged from 0.11 (Class A) to 1.55 (Class F). Nakdongdaero and Dadacro are the
two main road leading to the project site and its traffic capacities are 6.600
PCU/hr.
D. Impact
17.         Implementation of this project will benefit the eity's economy and
will contribute significantly to the improvement of living conditions of Pusan's
citizens. Relocation of the timber port from CGmchon Bay, and the processing
industries for timber and marine-products scattered throughout Pusan eLty to the
Dadaspo xste will increase economic efficiency of these industries by reducing
transportation costs, as well as improve Pusan s environment in particular air
purity and noise levels, while reducing Pusan city traffic congestion and risks
due ro road accidents. The provision of additional port capaeity will improve
shipping efficiency and reduce costs due to ship waiting time.
18.         Negative impacts, however, are inevitable, but most of them are minor
and/or can be minimized. The major impacts inL..e: (a) changes of topography,
coastline, land use, and sea bed due to dredging and soa reclamation, includLng
the correspondent Changes in water flow charace ristics; (b) partial loss of land
and marine ecology due to land clearance and dredging; (c) degradation of water
quallty and marine ecology, includLng seaweeds and other marine life, in the
Nakdong River mouth; Id) increase of air and noise pollution around the proposed
site due to the uoe of heavy equipment and transporta-tion during construction and
operation of the port and industrial complex; and (e) increase in generation of
wastewater and other wastes during construction and operation of the port and
industrial omnplex. Changes in climate, land ecology, recreation potential, soil
and underground water quality in the proposed site were expected to be small
given the isolated location and the nature of the activities.
19.         Extent of the major impacts was assessed using mathematical models



and other techniques, as appropriate. The results are briefly summarized am
follows:
(a) Changes of topography/sea bad/water flow.
About 1,623,000 m2 of the *-- will be reclaimed and the filling materials
will be acquirsd from the nearby private quarry *ites. Kuen Son mountain
and a small island will be deolished (total area of about 64,000 m21 and
the rocks and moil will be used in the construction. About 950,000 .3 of
rock, 1,650,000 3 of soil, and 9,050,000 .3 of sea sand will be rquired.
The coastline will be reduced by 2.4 km. The ship channel will be dredged
and the water depth maintained at 11-14 m. About 900,000 .3 of bottom
sediment will be excavated and disposed of on land and at wea. After
completion of the port construction, the tidal level will be increased by
a small amount (I cm), but the current speed will be decreased by 50% near
the mouth of Dadaspo Bay. The currant speed will be about 1-5 cm/sec in
the head area, 5-10 cm/sac in the middle area, and 5-30 cm/sec near the
bay mouth. These impacts are inevitable and contamination of heavy metals
at the disposal sites due to the dredged spoil are not expected.
Alternatives for basic design of the breakwater were carried out to asses
its influence on water flow in the bay (see Section E).
(b) Partial loss of land and marine ecology.
The impact On land ecology during construction and operation is expected
to be small. Greenery on the Xuen Son mountain and the island wlll be
removed. The impacts on migratory birds due to air/no'ee pollution is
expected to be minor since the proposed site is located far below the
freshwater area of the Makdong River where most of the migratory birds
congregate. Historical data (Table 2) suggest decreasing trends in both
species and number of the visiting birds in the area during the past 10
years. The loss of fishery areas and fishing rights are significant, but
the later will be adequately compensated according to the Korean Law.
(c) Degradation of water quality/marine ecology.
The impact is significant due to the increase in levels of SS and other
water pollutants. During construction, silt protectors will be installed
and low SS dredging technology will be used to minimize the impact due to
increasing level of SS. Through modelling, the area to be affected by an
increased level of SS of more than 3-5 mg/l would be less than 1.5 km2,
while the area to be affected by an increased level of SS of more than 1
mg/I would be less than S km2. Sewage and waste to be generated will be
effectively managed and di-sposed of. A wastewater treatment facility will
be constructed (capacity 11,000 m3/d) to treat wastewater frem industrial
complex.
(d) increase of air/noise pollution.
ALS; During construction, the major sources of air pollution are the use
of heavy equipment, transportation, and construction. The emission levels
from equipment were estimat-d from the number and type of equlpomnt
expected to be in use and the emissLon factors and the amounts of STSP from
transportation and construction were estimated.  The results are:
SourceeXlevel. (f(sec          TSP          S02          m           SQ

Using a mathematical model, total amounts of emission during construction
at the point next to the proposed site (Station A-1), based on an 8-hour
working period, will be 195 micro g/m3 TSP, 0.05 ppm S02, 0.05 ppm N02,
and 8 ppm CO. Only TSP will exceed the standard of 150 micro g/.3, but
thL high TSP level was considered to be temporary since a housing
development is being constructed at the site-
During operation, the total emLssion rates will be 2.29 g/e-c TSPI 9.14
9g/Cc S02; 24.14 g/--c N02; 22.87 g/sec CO of which the use of fuel in the
Industrial complex and land transportation are the major sources:

Total                   2.29        9.14         24.14     22.B7
From industrial complex, the use of fuel by timber and marine-product
processing industries is the major contributors.  For timber industrLes,
about 0.14 g/sec TSP; 1.27 g/-ec S02; 2.07 gsec 1N02; and 2.28 g/fec CO
were estimated while those from the marine-product proceceing indutries
will be 0.72 g/sec TSP; 5.66 g/sec S02; 10.79 g/-ec N02; and 5.78 g/sec
CO. These emission rates were calculated from the amount and type of
fuels commonly used and the emission factors. The emission amount from
timber processing was calculated from amount of timber cargo and mi-sion
factors. For all types of wood processing (including pulping, plywood
veneer, and lumber operation) about 0.011 g/s-c TSP; 0.006 g/sec S025 and
0.005 gfsec Co will be generated. Only 0.0001 g/sec TSP will be generated
from lumber operation.
A mathematical model was used and the maximum increase of aLr pollutants
in 2001 will be 12 micro g/m3 TSP; 0.033 ppm S02; 0.055 ppm 102; 0.081 ppm
CO. Theme impacts are considered to be small, but measures will be taken
to reduce the level of air pollutants.
Ni2LMe  During project construction, the noise level due to the operation
of construction equipment was estimated to be 70 dB(A) at the residential
area located about 1,000 m from the project site. This level is at the
upper limlt of the standard for construction sites (70 dB(A)). Bas-d on
the etiLmated amount of construction traffic of about 60 trucks/day, the
noise level due to this source at a distance of 10 m away from the road
Was estimated to be 52.8 dB(A) and the complex noise level at N-1 was 58.1
dB(A) which were within acceptable standards. Careful management of the
noise control program will be carried out. During operation, the noLse
level at a distance of 10 m from the road is estimated to be 68.7 dB(A)l
the imposing noLe level will be 12.3 dB(A); and the complex noLse level
will be 68.9 dB(A). These values exceeded the standard of 65 dB(A) and
thus mLtigation will be taken to reduce noise impact.
(5) Increase generation of wastes.
During operation, waste from the complex and its employees ia estimated at
11,000 m3/d of which 91% will come from the industries. The levls of am0
and SS of the was-tewater were entimated at 1,064 mg/l and 637 mg/l,
r-spectively. Generation of solid waste from the complex will be 33,434
t/y of which 31,731 t/y are general waste and 1,702 t/y are special waste.
Of the general waste 13,294 t/yr will come from marine foode processlng
zone; 3,303 t/yr from heavy industry, and 15,135 t/yr from lumber
processing industries. These wasten will be separated for possible reuse
and the remaining amounts will be treated and disposed of accordLng to the
waste management plan of Pusan city. It is estimated that about 21,181



7
t/y of the waste from timber and marine-product proesseing industries can
be roused; the remaining amount of 12,2S3 t/y will be disposed of at Sang
Cuk Dong, Kang sao Cu. Based on the amount of ship waste being generated
from existing ports and the expected incoming ships at Dadaspo Port of
496, about 73.8 t/y of ship waste will be generated.
Z. Analysis of lternatives
20.         ln an attempt to improve water quality in the inner bay, numerical
simulations were performed for the surrounding area. Four strategies were
considered to effect the smooth exchange of sea water, namely construction of
50., 100. and 20Dm widths for wea water circulation In the toe of the soutbhrn
breakwater to affect the best possible exchange of sea water between the inner
and outer bays. The wider the construction the more effectLvely water quality can
be improved in the inner bay because of optimal sea water exehange, but the
structure b eomes more vulnerablv to storms. Therefore, the narrower construction
for mea vater circulatlon Is considered more desirable because storms can be
hamful to the port. It was decided accordingly to limit the construction width
to 5Dm as a compromise for achieving both satisfactory sea water circulation and
stable conditions in the port.
F. Mitigation Plans
21.         To minimize the potential negative impact, the EIA proposed the
following plans;
(A)   Ecosystem - During constructLon, achieve the  eaa reclamation in
stages; use pumping/dredging ships which produce low SS; perform regular
monitoring of the SS level and reduce construction time if the SS
concentration exceeds 25 mg/ll Install a silt protector to prevent dAmage
from SS on the fishing area, which is located about 2 km away from the
site. During project operation, connect the wastewater from the wharf
faciltty to the sewage pipe of the treatment plant; equip  an oil
separation tank to remove SS and oil; and equip an oil removal boat and
oil fence for oil spill maintenance;
(b)  Marine environment -  After construction of the breakwater, a 50.
-sea water circulating section is recommended to increase water circulation
in ths bay. Installation of silt protector will reduce the amount of
suspended soLids over 90%.
(c)   Air quality -- The expectod pollutants and floating dust from the
operation of the construction equipment must be reduced as much as
practical. To achieve this goal, transport vehicles rhould be covered and
overloading and speeding will be prohibited. Also, all roads around the
project site should preferably be paved and all vehicles should be cleaned
beforc operation.
(d)   Water quality -  Sewge should be collected through the sewer.  The
wastewater treatmant plant, using activated sludge, should have a capacity
of 11,000 m3/day.
(a)   Waste materials - Mobile prefabricated toilets will be inotalled,
night-soil will be collected from workers during construction and its
disposal subcontracted. Construction debris, such as pieces of wood and
metal, will be collected and then landfilled in a designated site in
Pusan. Wastes during project operation will be separated and collected and
then treated according to the Pusan City waste treatment plan. Contract
arrangements will be made for the disposal of waste oil from construction
equipment and vessels; disaster protection will be secured in preparation
for possibLe vessel oil accidents. and waste oil will be separated and
treated according to the Pusan city waste treatment plan.

(f)  Noise -- 1i During construction, construction equipment and vessels
with low noise will be used to reduce the noise impact; noise will be
reduced by proper maintenan=s of equipment, vessels and vehicles; a sound
arrester will be attached to construction equipment and veseln to muffle
boiler noise; construction time *hould be mads as short as possible and
construction time limited at night; frictional noise from the road surface
will be minimized by leveling the road and paving the main entrance roadl
the effactive monitoring of work progres- will be made, and the movement
of equipment will be restrlcted by locating them strategically. The
driving sped of the construction vehicles will be limited to less than 40
km/hr and the use of horn will be prohibitted. The noise impact due to
construction equipment and vessels will be effectively minimized by
installlng a sound proof wall at the nearby school. ii) During project
operation, the vehicle driving speed will be limited to less than 25 km/hr
in passing through the residential area (the nelghborhood of the housing
land development). The use of horn will be prohibited on the main road.,
trees will be appropriately placed and a soundproof wall will be Lnstalled
to prevent direct noirs impact on the buildings.
C. Nanacement and Monitoring Plana
22.         A 5-year monitoring program -till be executed by XHPA starting from
the begLnning of the construction. XMPA in responsible for developing monitoring
plans during construction and operation. The monitoring parameters include air
quality (S02, N02, CO, TSP, Pb); noise; water quality (pH, DO, COD, SS, T-N, T-
P). The sampling ststions are elown in Figure 10.
r. Public Partigination
23.         Public consultation was carried during the preparation of the final
ZIA. The project was announe-d to about 1.500 local officials and residents. Of
the 260 respondees, 44.5S objected to the project and 55.5% approved the project
with conditions for proper compensation and protection of the environment. Th&
opinions are summarized as follows:
(a) Individual opinions Included the needs tot
* strictly protect the historic and cultural property (Jungwoon monument,
Molwoondae, dadaepo beach, Eulsuk island) and natural ecology;
- provide adequate compensatio3n to the damage for inhabitants; and
* prepare detailed mitigation plans to deal with air and noise pollution,
large traffic accident, marine pollution, and industrial wastes.
(b) General comments by MOE included:
* development of artificial fishery or marine habitats;
* prevent discharge of all pollutants and sewage and wastewater must be
treated before discharging; and
* adequately consult and negotiate with the inhabitants who are directly
and indirectly affected.
(c) MOE specific commnts includeds
* evaluate precisely the impact on natural envirorment due to changes of
coastline, land clearing, and reclamation;
* determine the amount of the required materials for reclamation;



9
' identify the sources and plan for quarry and the negative effacts on the
nearby areas;
* during construction, estimate and prepare mitigation plans to protect
breading habitat of migratory birds and marine scology;
* establish an anti-epidemic measure to prevent the germ and vermin of
lumbar from foreign country that may cause damage to the ecoeystm and
nearby areas;
* investigate animals, plants, and monuments to be preserved and prepare
plans for preservation;
' prepare a counter-plan to deal with typhoon and tidal wave;
* prevention of 55 and estimate amount of dredge materials and sa
pollution due to its disposal, change. of water flow, sand movemnt,
erosion, deposition in Nakdong including preparation of the mitigation
plan;
* estimate the amount of sewage and wastewater from complex and the impact
on water uses and prepare mitigation measures;
* estimate TSP for transportation of materials, reclamation and its
diffusion and mitigation measures;
* pave road, washlng cars, ete;
* estimate and mitigate bad smell and STP from complex on Dadaspo housing
development considering wind conditions;
- preeent plan of facility to deal with waste oLl and equipment to deal
with cil spill;
*esti mate noise levels at work site, nearby houses, and migrant area and
show effect of soundproofing during construction and operation 
* prepare waste collection and treatment plan;
* estimAte plan to create buffer zone;
0 Ostimate the traffic volume during construction/operation on maps and
analyze the impact and prepare mitigation plan; and
* establish post-snviror.mntal management plan.

ENVIRONNIENTAL ASSESSMIENT SUMMARY
THE 4TH PHASE CONTAINER TE:RMINAL FOR PUSAN PORT
A. Introduction
Pusan Port is the biggest port in Korea and handles about 95 % of Korea's container traffic.
However, a shortage of wharf capacity (only 65%) has resulted in increasing total ship waiting time.
reducing efficicncv of the port services, and weakening its commercial competitiveness internationallv.
To alleviate these problems, the government has decided to expand the container handling capacity of
Pusan Pon from 1.86 million TEU in 1991 to 3.06 million TEU in 1996 by building a new container
terminal in the Pusan Port area (calied Pusan 4th Phase). The new terminal is designed to be able LO
provide simulancous services to four 50.000 Dead Weight Tons (DWT) ships. The total investment cOst
is USS 470 million (374.7 billion won) of which S30 million would bc provided by the World Bank for
the procurement of equipment. The Korean Container Port Authority (KCTA) is responsible for the
iiiiplementaEion of the project and is under the supervision of the Korean Maritime and Port
Administration (KMPA).
--        'Under the Basic Enviromnental Qualitv Law of the Govecrmnent of Korea. thc implementing
&ancy of a por construacion project is required to conduct an envirommental impact assessment (EIA)
!.udy and submit it to Ministry of Environment (MOE) for review and approval. The implementing
a3ency is also responsible for the implenentation and monitoring of the mitigation measures and
periodically reportine the results to MOE.
3.         The EIA study for this project was conducted as part of the feasibility study by KIMWA with
assistance from consultants, the Tacyoung Engineering and Korea Technological Development Public
Corporation. The study was carried out following the guidelines specified by MOE. Duration of the study
Wvas 12 months (August 1990 to July 1991). and the EIA report was submitted to MOE in late July 1991.
The report presented the backgrund environmenall conditions. assessed the potential impacts. and
prtrp -sed the mitigation measures and the monitoring prograrn. It concluded that the projea site is located
well w-aiin the existing port arca and with adequate control of pollution, the negative impacts can be
rmiaimiz.d and the economic benefits highly posiLivc. The results of the study arc highlighted in Table
I and :ue briefly described in Section B. through Section G.
+          In addition to the EIA report, snpplemenary infomiation includmig the results of public
consultation as required by law (promulgated in August 1990) were submitted to MOE. The EIA study
was approved by MOE in December 1991 and its implementation has been carried out. The EIA approval
conditions and the stus of its cogpiiance are summarized in Secion J.
B. Project Description
5          The major activities of the project comprise: (i) construction of a continer termninal capable
of handling four 50.000 DWT ships simultaneously; (ii) dredging of a deep water ship channel; (iii)
caDtrmction of a 3-5 km 4-lane elevated expressway; and (iv) procurement of equipment for container
hanaiing. rie project would be implemnented during 1991 to 1996. Descriptions of the mnain activities
ktvi: stgniflcant enviromnental and social impacts are briefly surnmmarized in paragraphs 6 to 8.

6.         The container terminal would be constructed on the castem shore of the outer bay between
the mouth of the inner ba! and the 3rd phase container terminal (see Figure 1). The total area of the
container yard would be 798,B02 m2 of which 81 9 (647,559 rn2) would be reclaimed. The tcrminal area
would cxtend into the sea up to 598 m from the existing shoreline and the total length of the embankanent
would be 2,968 m. The front part (1.400 m) of the embanrkment is designed to serve four 50.000 DWT
ships whilc the cast pan (571 m) is designed to substitute 20,000 DWT and 5.000 DWT oil tankers for
an existing dolphin in the reclaimed area and the west part (997 m) is left for the disposal area.
Construction of the embankment and reclamation of the container yard would be carried out using 'The
Paper Drain Method". About 625.000 mn3 of stone would be acquired from the existing stone quarry site
E;uk Mountain) located at the mouth of Nakdong River; the stone would be transported to the project site
(28 km) via barges. Most of the landfill materials would be obtained from dredging of the ship channel.
7.         To accommodate the terminal design and to increase marine traffic efficiency, the new ship
channel (350 m wide) would deviate from the existing channel by 2 degrees (from N 53 degree W to N
55 degree W) and 150 m of the existing southern breakwater of the inner bay would be removed. The
total dredging area would be about 2.84 km2 and 11.6 million m3 of bottom sediment would be dredged
and used for reclamation.
8.         To facilitate the increasing demand for land transportation of the containers and to increase
traffic efficiency, a 3.5 kn 4-lane elevated road (called the 4th Phase Expressway) would be constructed
Lirnnecting Woo Am Road at Kamman Dong and the #2 Expresswav at Moonhvun (see Figure 6); only
minor land acquisition would be required.
C. Base Line Conditions
9.         Natural environment. Pusan Port is located on the southeastern coast of the Korean
Peninsula and is surrounded by mountains and densely populaLed and industrialized areas. Its location is
shown in Figure 1 and the general land use and drainage pattern of the area are shown in Figures 2 and
3. The climate of the area is of mild oceanic type and the predominant wind is North-East.
10.        The port area is divided into the inner and outer bays by the presence of two existing
breakwater: the north and the south. The total surface water area is about 24 km2 and the total shoreline
is about 37 kmn. The water depths range from 5 m at about 150 m offshore to 11 m at 350 m offshore
with a slope of about 1/40 towards west and southwest. The water quality standards (see Table 2) for the
inner and outer bays are classified as Clss HII suitable for industrial and harbor uses.
11.        Land and marine ecology surveys were carried out during October 1990 to June 1991 and
the nmber of species and individual were reported (see Table 1). Pine trees were the predominant land
plant. and the total plant standing was about 20.798 tons with a nt production of 5,970 tons/year. For
marine ecology, the prinary total oo3uctivity was 0.07-1.63 gm Clm3/day.
12.        A study on water flow characteristics in the port area was carried out and the measurements
were conducted in early December 1990. The average sea level was 65 cm; the average tidal range was
80 cm; and the average maximum velocity was 16 cm/sec. The tidal exchange per tide at the mouth of
the outer bay were 20.9 million m3 during flood tide and 19.6 million m3 during ebb tide while those
of the inner bay were 10.3 million m3 during flood and 8.5 million m3 during ebb. The water
replacnent rates were 6.3% for the outer bay and 17.3% for the inner bay.



-3-
13.        Four water quality surveys were conducred in the bay area in October 1990, January 1991.
April 1991. and June 1991 and water and sediment samples were collected and analyzed (Figure 4). The
results shown in Table 2 indicatc high concentrations of COD, nutrients. and oil in water samples. but
no significant levels of heavy metals. SS conccntrations ranged from 3-4 mg/I and COD ranged from 4-5
mg/I. No contamination of the bottom sediments was found and trace concentrations of CN. Cr+6. and
Hg were not dctectcd. A survey of the water uses identified two 1st class fishing areas (262 ha at Yongho
and 175 ha at Dongsam) near the mouth of the outer bay.
14.        Living environment. Four measurements of air quality and noise levels were conducted at
7 locations in the residcntial areas nearby thc project site (Figure 5) in October 199D (fall), December
1990 (winter). April 1991 (spring), and June 1991 (summer). The results shown in Table 3 indicate that
the air quality in the project area was well within the standards and was relatively better than the average
levels of the air quality of Pusan City. Noise levels, however were observed.to exceed the standards.
15.        Measurement of water quality in the lower part of the main streamn discharging water into
the Pusan Bay (Dongchon. 6.2 kan. drainage area 30.7 km2) indicated high pollution of which the annual
average BOD ranged from 36-46 mg/I. Concentrations of CN. Cd. and Pb were found to exceed the
standards. Analysis of groundwater in the area. however. indicated no contamination and the quality is
suitable for drinking purpose. Contamination of soil in the area was also not found-
16.        With the rapid development of the city and an increase in population and living standards.
the demand for water supplv and the generation of wastes have increased significantly. In 1989. the water
supply service capacity of the city was 2 million m31d and a service rate was 97-5%- The demand for
domestic water supply increased fron- 289 litericapita/day (Ipcd) in 1985 to 362 lpcd in 1989. The
demands fcr a 50.000 ton ship is 160 m31hr. Seweraze service capacity was about 2 million m31d (6
treamtent plants). The service area was 143 knm2 and the length of sewer was 4.100 km. The sewerage
sen-ce rate was 81% by area and 53% by sewer. In 1990. the amount of sewage generatecd from the
arainage area discharging its flows into Pusan Port was about 0.5 million rn3/d of which 0.2 million m3/d
would be treated at the Yongho treatment plant. In 2001. the generated sewage would be aboue 0.53
mnillion m3/d and about 0.43 million m3 would be treated.
17.        In 1989, the amount of garbage generated in the city was about 2.9 million t/y and the
collection service was 100%. The waste generation rate increased from 1.5 kgicapirafd in 1985 to 2.0
kglcapitaJd in 1989. For industrial waste, about 3.4 million uiy were generated from 1.754 industries of
which 9.5% came from special industry and 90.5% came from general industry. Of the special wastes,
about 5 % i,.:re toxic, 20% were waste oil, 34% were plastics. and 41% were acid and alkaline. About
3t[1 -f thes.e wastes were self-treated, 69% were treated through subcontractors, and the rest were safely
kept. I-or the industria waste generated fomt the general industry, 35% were organic and 65% were
sIkufl b'~ ..about 26% of these wastes were self-teated, 64% were subcontracted, and the rest were
safed ^ p. Generation of nightsoil was about 3,774 Idlday of which 51 % were collected by the city. The
VX1Llb, capacity of nightsoil treatment plants was 2,750 LdId and the actual treanent was 1,780 Idld.
18.        Socio-economics. Pusan is the second largest city in Korea- In 1989, the total population
was 3.86 million of which 2.70 million were over 15 year of age. and 1.55 million were the active
working force. The population density was 7.333 persons/km2; the mmber of households was 0.98
million; and the total housing was 0.54 million with a housing ownership rate of 55%. The
unemployment rate was 2.6%. While the total population over 15 year old increased 54% during 1980-
89. the working force population incrcased 70% and the unemployment rate decreased from 6.7 to 2.6.



-4-
Of the 1.55 million work force, 1.51 million were emploved in dhe industrial sector of which 58 % were
employed in the tertiary type industry (including port industry).
19.        In transportation sector, the total length of the existing road network in the citV was 2.577
kin of which 2444 kIn are city roads, 88 km are national roads, and 25 km are the expressways. The
najor road network near the project area is shown in Figure 6 and the imporant ones include Suyouing
Road. Choong Jang Road. Woo Am (1. 2. 3) Road. #1 Expressway, #2 Expressway, and 3rd Phase
Expressway. Existing traffic along these roads and the #1 Expressway ranged from 20,000-69,000 PCU/d
and the comainer contribution ranged from 5.4-35 %. The designed capacities of these roads ranged from
2.600-5.200 PCUIhr and the service quality (V/C) ranged from 0.48 (Class B) to 0.92 (class E). A
railway network is also present in the area. For marine traffic, the nunmer of in-bound and out-bound
ships were 20.034 and 19.695. respectively.
D. Impacts
20.        The EIA study concluded that implementation of the project would increase capacity and
efficiency of the container handling services in Pusan Port and would benefit the city of Pusan as well
as the nation's economy. In 2001, the container traffic would reach 1.2 million TEU and account for 33 %
of total freight in Pusan. Removing part of the existing irmer breakwaters would also increase water flow
in the inner and outer bays.
21.        The neeative impacts, however, are inevitable, but most of them are small and/or can be
minimized. Unavoidable impacts include: (a) partial loss of bottom sea and marine ecology due to
dredging; (b) changes of bottm topography, coasdine, and ld use due to dredging and reclaion;
(c) change of water flow characteristics; (d) increase concentration of SS durine terminal construction;
(e) increase of air and noise pollution due to the increase in transportation and operation of heavy
facilities; (f) increase of water pollution due lo wastes from ships and wharf facility, construction of the
elevated expressway, and ship accidents; (g) increase in the amount of wastes and demands for water
supply due to port activities; and (h) increase in traffic volume both land and marine. Since the proje
site is well located in the existing pon arca, the impacts on climate. land ecology, views and recreation,
and other aspects were cexected to be very small.
22.        The extent of the major impacts were assessed usine mathematical models and other
appropriate techniques. It was reported that:
(a) During construction, impact on plankton, seaweeds, and other marine life would be
significant due to increasing concentrations of SS and decreasing transparency in the water
column. These impats would not continue after the construction period and the marine
ecology can recover;
(b)   The sea area of Pusan Port would decrease by 0.65 km2 (3% of-the tota sea area); the
coastal line would increase by 1 kn (3% of the total coastline); increasing land area for
798.802 m2 of which 72.4% would be allocated for CY. 17.2% for building, 2-9% for
transpormation, and the remaining for other activities;
(c)   Changes in water flow characteristics would be small except in the area where the.:
breakwater is elininated in which the average maximum current velocity would decrease
by about 25 % ConstrucLion of the terminal would decrease the tidal movemen between the



site and the north-inner breakwater and thus decrease the water exchange rate in the inner
port. In addition. the removal of 200 m of the north-inner breakwater would increase the
water exchange volume and zhe water cxchanec rate in dte inner bay bv 5_85G and 3.1 %.
respectively;
(d) The impact on water quality in terms of SS and COD in the bay would be small. During
constuction, the arca to be affected by the increase in SS concentration of morc than 3 mg!l
would be less than 6 lm2 while that w be affeaed by the increase in SS concenration of
more ehan I mg/i would be less than 8 km2. During operation. SS concentration would be
less than 10 mgll which is similar to the present. COD concentration, however, would
increase about 1 rng1I in the outer bay and still exceed the Class III standards. Monitoring
program and other measures to increase water flow were recommended;
(e)   The impact on the fishing areas at the mouth of the outer bay would also be small. SS
concentation at the Sinsondac Bay. which is located about 2 km away from the project
area, would be increased by less than 0.1 mg/l. Silt protectors would be installed, however.
to prevent possible impacts to the area;
(f)  In 2001. concentrations of air pollutants would increase, but would remain within existing
standards. During construcion. N02 and TSP levels at Kamnman Dong. where the project
site to be located, would be 20-32 ppb N02 and 2.5-3.9 micro gmnm3 TSP. At Yongdong
Dong. where the elevaed road to be located. N02 would be 10.5 ppb and TSP would be
1.5 micro gmlrn3. At Janglim Dong, where stone quarry site is located. N02 would be 22.2
ppb and TSP would be 122.7 micro gmnm3. During operation. concenuatons of S02.
N02. CO. TSP would be 3-12 ppb. 2-6 ppb. 0.4-1 ppb. and 2-5 ticro gm/m3,
respectively;
(g)  Noise impacas are significam and would exceed the standards in some areas. During
construction. noise level at a distance of 130 m away would be about 5-i68 dB(A). During
operation in 1996. noise from the elevated road in the arca about 50 m away would be 61
dB(A) during daytime and 56 dB(A) during nightime. In 2001, noise levels would be 62
dB(A) during daytime and 57 dB(A) during nighttime which are slighly in excess of the
current stadards. Mitigation measures are required;
(h)  The impact on public health is mainly due to the increased demand for water supply and
waste management. After completion, a total supply of 3.271 m3/d would be required. Of
this amount 329 m3Id would bc needed for domestic uses, 2,900 m3/d for ships, and 42 m3
of fire fighting purpose. General waste would increase by 2.4 t/d and nightsoil would
increase by 1.6 kIcd. The liquid and solid wastes including nightsoil would be sent for
proper treatment by the city;
(i)   The impact on socio-economic enviroment include the increase in population of about
1.645 people due to increase in port business. These people would commute from
neighboring areas and should not have any significant impact on housing. In 2001. the
industrial conainer traffic would reach 1.2 million TEU and account for 33% of ttaml
freight of Pusan. If we classify this project as tertiary industry, it would account 0.15% of
Pusan's tertiary industry in 1996; and



-6-
(j)   The impact on land traffic would bc duc to increasing container freight after 1996. By that
time the 3rd Phase Expressway, #2 Expressway, and the 4th Phase Expressway would be
in opcration and the estismted traffic on the mnajor road network would range from 2,156-
5.154 PCUIr (V/C of 0.55-1.14) in 1996 and 2,210-6.242 PCUlhr (VJC 0.62-1.47) in
2001. During operation of the project, the service capacity of the existing expressway
(Moonhyum-Wondong) would be degraded from C-D level to E-F levels. On marine
traffic, the increase in ihe number of ships would also increase the possibility for traffic
accidents in the port area. Construaion of the 4th Phase Expressway would temporarily
increase SS in Dongchon and increase the levels of air and noise pollution.
E. Analysis of Alternatives
23.        As an attenpt to improve water quality in the inner bay. the demolition of 200 m of the
north-inner breakwater was recommended in addition to the removal of 150 m of the south-inner
breakwater despite the high cost. A comparative smdy of two alternative schemes: (i) remnoving 150 m
of the south-inner brcakwater and (ii) removing 150 m of the south-inner brcakwater and 200 m of the
north-inner breakwater. were analyzed using a mathematical model. It was reported that the alternative
(i) would increase the amount of water volume in the inner bay from the existing amoum of 64.9 million
m3 by 1.8%, increase the amount of water exchange volume from the existing 22.2 million m3 by 3.8%.
and increase the water exchange rate from the exisimg 25.5%C by 1.6%. The increased amnounts would
much smaller in the outer bay. For alternative (ii). the amount of water volume in the inner bay would
be increased by 1.8%. the amount of water exchange volume would be increased by 5.8%. and the water
exchange rate would be increased by 3.1%. The increases in the outer bay would be smaller but higher
than those of the alternative (i). The implementation costs were estimated to be 2.6 billion Won (S3
million) for alternative (i) and 6.1 billion Won (S7A million) for alternative (ii).
F. Mitigation Plans
24.        To miniize the potential negative impacts. the study proposed the following mitigation
mneasures:
(a)   Topography - to preven ground erosion, the weak ground in the construction area would
be strenghened using the Deep Cement Mixing method; the landfilling would be carried
out using the Paper Drain method;
-    (b)  Ecosystem - installation of silt protectors in front of the construction site (both inside and
outside the waste way, dredger, and the nearby fishing ground);
(c)   Marine environm- - During consction, peform consruction of the reclamation area
b, sages; use pumping dredging ship which produces low SS; install silt protector around
remaining sea area;, regular monitoring ol the SS level-and reduce/limit the constuction
period if the SS concentration exceeds 25 mgfl; instal silt protector to prevent damage due
to SS on the nearby fishing area which is located about 2 km away from the site. During
operation, connect the wastewater from wharf facility to sewage pipe of Yongho tream
plant: equip oil separation tank to remove SS and oil; and equip oil rcnoval boat and oil
fence for oil spill care;



-7-
(d)   Air qualitY - install wheel wash and vehicle wash systems at the entrance of the
construcaion site: periodically sprinicle water to reduce scattered dust caused by construction
equipment: pump seabed soil and sand and transfer it for use as refill materials; transport
sand and stone via barges;
(e)   Waste materials - contract for the disposal of waste oil from construction equipment and
vessels; secure disaster protecion vessel and oil fence in preparation for oil accident:
separate wastes and treat them according to Pusan city waste treatmewn plan;
(f)   Noise and vibration - adjust construcaion time band (08.00-16.00); limit driving speed of
construction vehicles (lower than 20 km/hr); install temporary sound proofing fence in the
noise influence area during construction; install aluminurn sound proof wall at both sides
of the elevated expressway;
(g)   Transportation - For land. constuct a 4-lane elevated expressway and increase traffic
efficiency through effective management. For marine, increase traffic efficiency and safety
by chaneing the new ship channci and installing a Vesscl Traffic Control System (VTCS);
and
(h)   Moinitoring - Constant checking of various pDuUtnts in the project area and for the
effectiveness of the mitigation plan.
G. Monitoring and Evaluation
25.        During construction and dredging, SS concentrations would be monitored every month to
ensure proper protection of water quality and marine ecology; monitoring of plankton would be carried
out once every three months. During operation. COD and plankton concentrations would be monitored
every quarter. The results would be reported to MOE periodically.
H. Institutional Needs
26-        The implementing agency. KMPA, is responsible for implementing the proposed mitigation
mneasures and monitoring p!3n. Monitoring of the compliance would be made periodically by MOE Pusan
regional offic;. Pusan city also moniLors general enviromentaul quality of the arca. The ELA report
identified the need to establish an oil spill management office in KMPA to (i) monitor careless discarge
of ship wastes and waste oil and (ii) to prepare eWdipment and chemicals necessarv to deal with oil spill.
No details for the proposed management office were given in the report.
I. Public Pa2ricipation
27.        The public consultaion was made in accordance to the Korean Law. The projeac was
announced publicly through newspapers and public notices and the EIA report was available for public
review and comments. The results indicated no objections by the public providing that adequate
compensation would be provided to the fishermen and women divers who made a living. aldough
illegally, in the area. These results were sent to MOE for its consideration.



J. EIA Approval Conditions and Status of their Compliances
28.        The EIA approval conditions issued by MOE basically followed the mnitigation and
monitoring plans proposed in the EIA study and thev are summarized as follows:
(a)   Overall - EIA matigation and post managemnent should be followed; if there are any
changes in the mitigation plan, it should bc agreed upon in advance;
(b)   Topography - if topographic changes are anticipated (quarry, elevated road). drainage and
reservoirs might be installed; after completion of the constuction. stabilization of soil and
landscapc plan should be csablishcd and carried out. During construction, strengthening of
sof ground and landfilling should be carried out using the Deep Cemrmt Mixing and Paper
Drain methods;
(c) Ecology - install silt protector in foreground;
(d) Marine environment - install silt protectors in front of the project area during construction
of the embankmcnt; after embankmcnt, install additional silt protector in front of the waste
way and outer sea when doing landfill. During dredging. install proper size of silt protector
according to the location of the dredging line; in front of Sinsondae area, the pumping
dredge method has to be adopted after installing silt protectors. To prevent the impact on
water flow, remove 150 m of the south-inner bay breakwater at the first stage and 200 m
of the north-inner bay breakwater before construction of the cmbankment by the new
disposal area- The monitoring plan around nearby sea has to be established and implemented
(number of monitoring sites and frequency, monitoring items). For the area where erosion
and sedimentation are expected due to changes of water flow, adequate counter mcasures
must be estblished. Construction of the landfilling should be conducted gradually. When
SS is over 25 ppm, reduce and limit the construction period- During operation, wastewaler
has to be sent to Yongho trea8mi  plant;
(e)   Air quality - instaDl flying dust reduction facilities; install car washing flcilities; regular
water spraying; pump and use the sea bottom sand as landfill materials; all stone should be
delivered by barges;
i)   Water quality - all wastewater from wharf facilities after landfill should be collected and
treated at Yongho STP (so interceptor should be insalled before completion of
construction);
(g)   Waste - proper measures (screen, satting pond) should be installed to prevent the
possibility of waste discharge into the sea during rainy days. Ship waste oil1,slWuld be
treated by subcontractors and oil fence should be secured in case of oil spill;
(h)   Noise and vibration - use low vibrating machine; work during daytime (8.00-16.00);
install panel in construction site; restriction of car speed a20 krnlhr); if explosion is
inevitable, minimize amount of dynamite and ensure prior notification of explosion plans.
and install sound proof walls at both ends of the clevaEd expressway;



-9-
(i)   Natural resources - establish compensation plan for those to be directly affected by the
project;
(j)   Other - to prevent damage to residents, make detailed plan of daily construction amount
and use of construction facilities. If damage is inevitable in certainr areas. proper
compensation should be made to prevent any complaints from residents; and
(k) Post plan - post management plan should be made and implemented and the results should
be written following the specified fonnat and submitted annually to the MOE Pusan by end
of January.
29.        In 1992. KMPA/KCTA and the affected fishermen and women divers nego-iated the
compensation amount which had been assessed by the Marine Research Institme and National Fisheries
University of Pusan. A total amount of about 232 million wons (S290.000) was paid to 16 fishermen
(including their boats) and 8 women divers in July-December 1992.
30.        Construction of the embankment and part of the reclamation were carried out in 1992.
According to the MOE's report, as of Febnrary 1993. about 40% of the total works were completed and
mDst of the EIA conditions were followed-
