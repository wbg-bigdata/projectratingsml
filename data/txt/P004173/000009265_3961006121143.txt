PORTS DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Loan and Proiect Summary
Borrower:             Republic of Korea
Amount:               US$100 million equivalent
Terms:                15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate
Project
Description:          The project would  provide  comprehensive  support for addressing
environmental issues in port and harbor development. The project would
design and construct facilities for the collection, storage, treatment and
disposal of waste from ships, and would install a vessel traffic management
system to monitor, regulate and control the movements of vessels at the Ports
of Pusan and Inchon/Asan. The project will also assist in financing the
construction of the port and industrial complex at Dadaepo to allow for the
relocation of many of the timber and fish processing plants from the current
locations in the City of Pusan, and assist in the financing of container handling
equipment for the Pusan Phase IV Container Terminal. The project will also
6               finance a package of training and technical assistance which has been
developed to strengthen the capability of KMPA to address environmental
issues, and a program to monitor pollution, ecosystem productivity,
biodiversity and changes in the yields of living marine resources in the Yellow
Sea.
Benefits
and Risks:            The project will improve the environmental conditions in the City of Pusan by
reducing the air and noise pollution from the truck traffic related to the
approximately 130 timber and 107 fish processing plants that will be relocated
from the center of the City to Dadaepo. Additional benefits, from reduced
truck traffic, will be realized when the 34 off-dock container yards are
relocated to on-dock facilities and an inland container depot. The ship waste
disposal facilities and the vessel traffic management system will improve the
marine environment, and the environmental training program and the technical
assistance to KMPA will strengthen the institutional capability to address
marine environmental issues throughout the country. The main risks concern
the implementation of policy decisions involving the removal of the timber and
fish processing plants and the off-dock container yards and the rezoning of the
vacated land, and the private sector financing of the port of Dadaepo. The
anticipated impact of these risks is not expected to be great because its
Government has clearly stated its intention to transfer industrial operations
away from residential areas, and private sector groups have demonstrated their
capacity to finance the construction of the port facilities.
Poverty Category:     Not applicable.

I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport Network
1.1        Korea has developed a multi-modal transport network capable, in the past, of supporting
its sustained and phenomenal economic growth. The fast pace of economic growth has, however, placed
heavy demands on all infrastructure facilities, including those in the transport sector, which are often
operating close to or at capacity. In 1992, Korea's transport network comprised about 56,500 km of
roads, some 1,550 km of expressways, about 6,500 km of railroad track, 48 international ports with 190
million tons (248 million revenue tons) of cargo handling capacity, and airports with capacity for 21
million passengers per year. In the same year, about 90% of all domestic passenger traffic, including
urban traffic, moved by road. About 70% of domestic freight traffic moved by road, while over 30%
moved by rail, and virtually all international containerized cargo went through the Port of Pusan. During
the 1981-92 period, demand for transport services essentially doubled.
1.2        In the Sixth Plan (1987-91), transport sector investments were concentrated on roads (65%),
followed by ports (20%), and rail (12%). In the Seventh Plan (1992-96), resources are allocated to roads
(46%), rail and subways (35%), ports (12%) and air transport (7%). The allocations across sub-sectors
did not change significantly with the New Economic Plan (1993-97). Included in this Plan are
investments in new expressways, new passenger and truck terminals, a high speed train to operate
between Seoul and Pusan, expanded subway systems in Seoul and Pusan and new subway lines in four
other cities, a new international airport near Inchon, and new port facilities in Pusan, Kwangyang Bay
(see Annex 1), Inchon and at several secondary ports.
B. Sector Issues and Government Objectives
1.3        Major sector policy issues to be addressed during the current Plan (1993-97) include: (a)
creating a sector structure to raise transport efficiency further and cope with the increasing
internationalization of the Korean economy;(b) expanding multi-modal and mass transport facilities to be
responsive to increased demand, especially in and to large urban centers; and (c) strengthening transport
administration and coordination.
1.4        The New Economic Plan aims to address the sector concerns by: (a) effecting changes in
the patterns of growth in transport demand by promoting rail transport, giving priority to the development
of mass transport networks to serve both urban and regional transportation needs and strengthening the
multi-modal transport network for both passengers and freight movement to and from the ports; (b)
relieving congestion along the Seoul-Pusan corridor by expanding transport facilities and rationalizing
inter-regional demand, and developing Inland Container Depots (ICD) in the Seoul and Pusan areas for
efficient container cargo handling; (c) improving financial resources for sector investments by increasing
tax rates, introducing user charges, encouraging a greater private sector financing role, issuing bonds and
seeking external resources; (d) improving land acquisition and compensation policies to avoid construction
delays; and (e) introducing a regional strategic planning system under which 5-year regional plans would
be developed by local authorities in collaboration with central government planners.

C. The Ports Subsector
1.5  TraMc and Capacity.   Korea's export-oriented industrializationpolicy combined with its need
to import raw materials has placed increasing demands on maritime transport. Port infrastructure and the
vessel fleet have therefore been expanded rapidly, and Korea had, in 1992, 48 ports with the capacity to
handle about 248 million revenue tons (rt) of cargo and docking capacity for about 366 ships along 111
km of berths. The capacity for petroleum and other liquid cargoes is about 145 million rt while the
capacity for dry cargo is 248 million rt. Since 1980, cargo volume has increased at an annual rate of
about 10%. Of the 455 million rt of freight that passed through Korean ports in 1992, containerized
cargo amounted to 44 million rt or 2,876,468 TEU. However, aggregate design handling capacity was
available only for 2,460,000 TEU.
1.6        The continuing expansion of Korea's foreign trade and coastal shipping will require major
expansion of port facilities and increases in the vessel fleet. Seagoing traffic grew 15.2% per annum over
the Sixth Plan (1987-91) and is projected to increase 5% during the current Plan (1993-97). The largest
share of the seagoing traffic, about 30%, will use Pusan and Inchon, the two largest ports. Among the
major commodities transported, petroleum will remain the most important, followed by coal,
containerized and breakbulk cargoes. Growth of petroleum is about 2.7% per annum compared to 12.6%
for containers and 10.6% for coal. These trends show the increasing containerization of general cargo.
1.7        As a result of this large increase in port traffic, Korea's ports, especially Pusan, suffer from
serious port congestion. In 1992, 14,937 ships entered Pusan Port of which 648 or 4.3% experienced
waiting time aggregating 44 hours each on average. Of the 3,815 container ships using Korean ports, 218
or 5.7% waited an average of 22 hours due to inadequate berthing and handling facilities. Ship waiting
time was even higher and averaged 74 hours each for 1,201 ships entering Inchon port, almost half the
total number. The Korea Maritime Institute (KMI) has estimated the direct losses caused by the above
delays at about W50 billion (US$ 62.5 million) in 1992, but the direct and indirect economic losses, due
to the increased cost of Korean cargo resulting from higher transportation outlays, would be nearly ten
times that amount.
1.8        Port Development Plans.  The foregoing shows that the expansion of Korea's foreign
trade and coastal shipping will continue to require major increases in port facilities, vessel fleet and
trained personnel. Port investment, as a percentage of GNP, averaged 0.21% during the thirty years
ending in 1991 but showed a declining trend dropping to 0.17% in the Sixth Plan 1987-91. In
comparison, port investment in Japan, as a percentage of GNP, was 0.31 % in 1991 and in Taiwan 0.30%
in 1990, which was much higher than in Korea in recent years. Port investment is expected to increase
to 0.33% of GNP in the New Economic Five Year Plan (1993-97) with a view to achieving the following
specific objectives:
(a)   maintain an annual growth rate of 8.4% in freight handling capacity aimed at reaching an
overall freight handling capacity of 356 million (rt) by 1996 and 512 million rt by 2001,
will be actively pursued;
(b)   plan port investment with a view to developing key ports to stimulate balanced regional
development with an emphasis on Korea's west coast in preparation for expanding trade
around the Yellow Sea rim and passenger traffic with China, and eventually, North Korea;



-3-
(c)  increase private sector financing for constructing new ports, greater specialization of port
functions and for optimizing the utilization of existing facilities;
(d)   adopt an integrated approach linking port development with improving inland transport
systems and urban development in the context of overall national priorities to link up key
population centers; and
(e)   give priority to addressing marine, coastal and urban environmental issues by collecting ship
waste, expanding pollution control facilities at harbors and surrounding built-up areas,
improving port operations and enforcing regulations.

(1,183)                (923)
1.9       In pursuit of the above mentioned port development objectives, the emphasis, during the
New Five Year Economic Plan (1993-97), will be placed on several specific investment and policy
initiatives. In order to meet the inadequate container handling capacity in Pusan, an unsatisfactory freight
distribution system, increasing traffic congestion in Pusan, and consequently, the enhanced cost of
manufactured exports, investments will be made to: (a) expand the container facilities at Pusan Port and
Kwangyang Bay; (b) construct an ICD outside of Pusan and close the off-dock CYs to ease transportation

Period.

and pollution problems in Pusan and reduce distribution costs; (c) construct the port-cum industrial
complex at Dadaepo to reduce truck traffic and noise and air pollution in the city by relocating many of
the timber and fish processing plants; and (d) use private sector financing to develop facilities at
Kwangyang Bay, Pusan and Inchon. Special attention will be given to appropriately locating adequate
port facilities to expand Korea's trade contacts with China, Russia and North Korea. Investment plans
will include the expansion of coastal shipping transport capacity to accommodate the use of large volume
and specialized ships and facilities.
1.10       As shown in the earlier table, KMPA has estimated that about W3.3 trillion (US$4. 1 billion)
will be required for the planned port investments during the New Five Year Economic Plan period (1993-
97) of which about W2.4 trillion (US$3.0 billion) will come from Government financing and about WO.9
trillion (US$1.1 billion) from private sector resources. Of this outlay, the major investments will be for
the expansion of container facilities at Pusan and Kwangyang Bay, and the construction of the ICDs
outside Seoul and Pusan.
1.11       Organization and Stafrin     KMPA is a public sector administration, but its role and
functions have been carefully designed to allow some operational flexibility within clearly defined powers
under the overall supervisory umbrella of the MOT. While KMPA provides the port infrastructure to
meet shipping needs and directly collects revenue from port users, it delegates in most instances, the
functions of handling and storing the cargos on leased piers and in warehouses to private port terminal
operating and stevedoring companies. Port handling equipment is usually privately owned. Such a
distribution of functions ensures a high level of efficiency in cargo handling as it is essentially a private
sector operation. It also facilitates the mobilization of resources for port infrastructure development from
both public and private sector sources.
1.12       KMPA is headed by an Administrator who is appointed directly by the President of the
Republic of Korea and has the rank equivalent to a Vice Minister. The Administrator is assisted by a
Deputy Administrator who is designated by the Minister of Transportation upon the recommendation of
the Administrator. KMPA is organized into eleven Bureaus and offices which administer all marine affairs
through the ten District Maritime and Port Administrations (DMPAs). KMPA's staff totals about 2170,
including 335 at headquarters and 1835 at various regional offices. Of the total staff, about 570 are in
technical positions and 1600 in management and administration. There is a continuing need to strengthen
functions, especially the capacity to undertake the more complex aspects of long-term port investment and
planning in the context of rapidly and persistently rising demand, unavailability of adequate public sector
resources to meet all necessary capacity improvements and the priority need to address environmental
issues.
1.13       A recent organizational change resulted in the establishment of the Korea Container
Terminal Authority (KCTA) in April 1990. KCTA was entrusted with the management, development and
operation of all container handling facilities in Korea. KCTA has the power to make investments,
mobilize funds by issuing bonds and incurring foreign and local debt, and to lease it's container facilities.
Such facilities include those of the Pusan Container Terminal Operating Company (PCTOC), which is
managing the first and second phase container handling terminals in Pusan and a new operating company,
the Pusan East Container Terminal (PECT) to operate the third phase container terminal. KCTA is the
single, largest shareholder (25%) in PECT, but the majority shares (75%) are owned by eleven private
stevedoring companies. While KMPA must approve KCTA's annual plans and budget, the new company
has autonomy in its day to day operations. KCTA receives the profits from PCTOC and PECT and re-



-5-
invests it in new container handling facilities such as the inland container depots at Yangsan, north of
Pusan, Uiwang close to Seoul and the new Port of Kwangyang Bay.
1.14       Operations and Maintenance. The DMPAs are nominally responsible for cargo handling
operations at the ports, but it is the numerous private Terminal Operating Companies (TOC) that do the
actual cargo loading and unloading. The DMPAs, therefore, have a largely supervisory and cobrdinating
role in operations. The use of the TOCs was recommended in an earlier Bank-financed study. At Pusan,
there are several TOCs which operate at the grain, general cargo, bulk cargo and container piers. The
two container terminals are operated at Pusan by separate TOCs, as described earlier. Since the
maintenance of the terminals is the responsibility of the TOCs and most port equipment is privately
owned, the port maintenance carried out by the DMPAs is limited to civil works and the dredging of
access channels. This work is carried out satisfactorily.
1.15       Accounting. Budgets and Auditing.  Port budgets are prepared at KMPA headquarters
using information from individual ports. The annual budget is allocated directly to KMPA from the
Economic Planning Board (EPB) as a line item rather than on an operational basis. As an enterprise
established under the Government Invested Enterprise Act and related regulations, KMPA is subject to
the supervisory control of the MOT and EPB. It also means that port operating revenue is regarded as
part of the general government revenue and port operating costs plus funds for investment are provided
from the government budget. However, effective January 1, 1994, all port generated revenues will be
retained in the sub-sector for future port capital investments. All of KMPA's operating expenses will
continue to be financed directly from the government budget (para 5.4).
1.16       KMPA uses standard government accounting but, under an earlier Bank-assisted project,
an alternative commercial accounting system was developed to replace it. However, under the instructions
of MOT, KMPA is implementing the commercial accounting system in parallel with standard government
accounting.
1.17       KCTA uses generally accepted accounting principles applied in a commercial accounting
system. Annual budgets are prepared on a line item basis rather than on an operational basis and
submitted to KMPA for approval along with the annual business plan.
1.18       The National Board of Audit and Inspections, which reports directly to the President,
inspects all of KMPA's accounts. In addition, the commercial accounts of KMPA and those of KCTA
are audited by independent auditors in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the Government will cause KMPA and KCTA to have their
financial statements and those of each of the DMPAs audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank. Such financial statements and audit reports would also include a separate opinion from the auditor
on disbursements made using Statements of Expenditures (SOE) and on the IBRD Special Account for
the Bank loan. Such statements and audit reports would be submitted to the Bank within eight (8) months
of the end of each fiscal year.
D. Lessons Learned From Previous Operations
1.19       Altogether, five PPARs have been prepared for transport projects in Korea - one for the
First and Second Port Projects, three for the six completed road projects, and one each for the Sixth and
Seventh Railway Projects and the Coal and Cement Distribution Project. No particular issues were raised



- 6 -
in the implementation of the road projects. The need to develop detailed operating plans for project
facilities was identified in the ports projects. Despite some cost and time overruns, physical works and
procurement under the two railway projects were completed satisfactorily and the ex-post ERRs
amounting to 22% and 15%, respectively, demonstrated that Bank financing was economically justified.
1.20       The Coal and Cement Distribution Project as completed did not resemble the original project
design because the Government modified its coal utilization policy soon after the loan was approved. The
project was recast at the inception of project implementation and was successfully completed despite some
delay. The PPAR also concluded that the quality of the completed project work as well as maintenance
in the three railway projects was good and that the sustainability of the benefits was certain. The main
concerns in the railway and ports projects related to the institutional achievements.
1.21       In FY92-93, four project completion reports (PCRs) were prepared for Bank-financed
transport projects, including the Seoul Urban Transport Project (2514-KO), the Kyonggi Regional
Transport Project (2905-KO), the Seoul-Pusan Corridor Project (2600-KO) and the Third Pusan Port
Project (2726-KO). While each PCR identified issues specific to the project concerned, there were also
a number of common findings, as follows: (a) achieving institutional changes or financial restructuring
has been difficult, particularly when such changes, for example tariff increases, are outside the immediate
control of the project entity or there are strong social or political pressures against them; (b) since the
level of transport investment required to assist the country to continue its present pace of economic
development is beyond the Government's ability to finance, exploring new sources of financing for sector
investments has, therefore, become critical, with the Government seeking innovative options to encourage
private sector participation; (c) more attention needs to be paid to environmental issues, both physical and
social, to avoid costly project delays and poor investment choices; (d) decisions concerning investments
in transport tend to be based as much on social as they are on economic need, with visible initiatives,
such as capital construction being more popular than management or other efficiency improvements; and
(e) while domestic capacity to construct civil works is very strong, there is a marked weakness in the
implementation of advanced technology and computerized systems.
1.22       The following observations are appropriate in regard to the above-mentioned PCR
comments: (a) evidence of major uneconomic investments in the sector or purely politically motivated
projects have not been identified by the Bank or any other source. In fact, one of the problems has been
delays in undertaking some major, essential investments due to a protracted evaluation process of
investment priorities in the context of scarce public resources given the large public investment demands
of a dynamic economy; (b) although in the past pervasive central control has inhibited institutional change
or tariff increases due to concerns about macroeconomic fundamentals such as inflation and growth, a
less intrusive policy is now evolving with more enterprise autonomy and relaxed central controls; (c) this
project and the construction of the container terminals at Kwangyang Bay are illustrative of a new
Government strategy of seeking private sector resources to finance major transport investments and the
innovative initiatives which are being taken to realize the strategy; (d) the Government has put in place
an effective and acceptable Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedure and an institutional
framework to monitor all capital projects, including transport infrastructure, before they are approved
for implementation; and (e) Korea's need for more advanced technology and system computerization is
readily acknowledged in the dialogue with the Bank, and an effective system for promoting both
domestic R&D and technology transfer has been established and is being implemented, inter alia, through
Bank assistance in several technology advancement and related projects.



-7-
1.23       The PCR for the Third Pusan Port Project (2726-KO) raised issues concerning the
environmental impact of port development and the sensitivity of the Government as well as the project
entity (KMPA) towards addressing those issues. For example, during project preparation and initial
implementation both physical and social environmental impacts were not addressed as seriously as
warranted, and the resulting problems were encountered with ecological damage to bird nesting sites
through dredging, land acquisition to complete a rail link to the port as well as compensation to a large
number of affected people. In hindsight, similar comments are probably appropriate in many other Bank-
assisted infrastructure investments generally, which were prepared at a time when environmental issues
were not at the forefront of project sustainability concerns and the project authorities were not equipped
to anticipate them. However, as noted earlier, a radical change towards greater environmental protection
has taken place and, in the present project, attention to related environmental issues underlies the rationale
for a Bank role, and has been given very high priority in project preparation by all concerned institutions.
(paras 3.3, and 3.26 - 3.35).
II. THE ENVIRONMENT SECTOR
A. Legal and Institutional Framework
2.1        As a result of Korea's rapid urbanization and industrialization and the steadily rising living
standards, environmental problems began to emerge in the 1970s. Air, soil and water pollution increased
with the rapid growth in motor vehicle ownership, rising volumes of household and industrial waste and
the growing use of agrochemicals. In responding to these demands, the Government took the first major
step in creating an institutional and legal framework to address environmental concerns in 1977 with the
establishment of the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) under the Ministry of Health and Social
Affairs (MOHSA). This was followed in 1978 by the Environmental Preservation Law, the first major
environmental statute in Korea. This law introduced a number of important regulatory devices including
the promulgation of environmental and emission standards, environmental monitoring, and environmental
impact assessment (EIA) for new projects.
2.2        The increasing complexity of environmental issues and the growing public sensitivity to them
in the 1980s led the Government to conclude that existing legislation needed to be broadened and its
imnplementation strengthened. This resulted in 1990 in upgrading the EMB into the cabinet-level Ministry
of Environment (MOE) and, in 1991, in the introduction of new legislation, the Basic Environmental
Policy Law. These steps were supported by the passage of separate laws dealing with specific problems
including air quality, water quality, noise control, hazardous substance control, solid waste management,
marine pollution, and environmental dispute resolution. Enactment of this legislation has given the
Government a stronger mandate to address a broad range of environmental issues. The legislation is also
subject to periodic review and has already been revised with regard to solid waste, marine pollution and
natural environment preservation.
2.3        Local authorities are responsible for implementation of the environmental laws at the local
levels. In June 1992, most of the monitoring and enforcement responsibilities were decentralized from
MOE to the 14 municipal and provincial governments. The latter are now responsible for guidance to
and inspection of manufacturing firms, issuance of permits and registration of pollutant-dischargingfirms,
levying and collection of discharge taxes and negligence fines, and closing down repeat offenders. MOE
is the key agency responsible for formulation of policy and planning, approval of EIAs, establishment



- 8 -
of emission and ambient standards, monitoring and enforcement, and research and training. MOE retains
central authority for the registration of toxic chemical manufacturers, and, through its regional offices,
for periodically monitoring the environmental conditions including the compliance with the EIA.
B. Environmental Policy
2.4        The overall thrust of Korea's environmental policies is highlighted in the New Economic
Five-Year Plan. The Plan calls for the strengthening of environmental standards to the level of the
advanced industrialized countries and the strengthening of the "polluter pays principle" through raising
the pollution excise tax and the introduction of advance deposits to ensure that the producers of toxic or
nondegradable products (e.g. tires) finance the cost of disposal. The Plan sets objectives and, in a
number of instances, proposes quantitative targets in key environmental areas. These areas are: (a) water
quality - raise the quality of drinking water, expand sewerage treatment, improve industrial waste water
management and strengthen river water management; marine preservation - expand pollution controlled
dredging in port areas, improve waste water management in fishing areas, tighten pollution discharge
controls and strengthen pollution control capabilities; (b) solid waste management - increase the number
of regulated landfills, improve recycling of household waste, establish waste salvage stations to collect
and sort waste materials suitable for reuse, and expand waste facilities; (c) air quality - increase the
supply of clean fuels, reduce sulphur content in oils, raise auto emission standards and tighten
enforcement of emission standards; and (d) environmental science and technology - preparation of a
comprehensive plan for the development of environmental science and technology, promotion of R&D
projects in pollution monitoring and control, and the development of low-pollution technologies.
2.5        The "polluter pays principle" is considered in Korea as essential to ecologically sustainable
development. Such an approach will help the Government in its plans to introduce an environmental
charge system in the country, which is to levy a tariff on activities which pollute air, land and water.
The objective of the effluent charge system in Korea is not to send a price signal to the polluting source
but to impose a penalty against non-compliance. However, since the charges are too low to deter
pollution, polluters often find it cheaper to pay the penalties rather than take costly abatement measures.
Although the present system does not provide any economic incentive to reduce emissions nor to induce
the adoption of newly developed technology, the long term plan is to increase the charges in order to
make the "polluter pays" system effective.
C. Marine Environment and Pollution Control
2.6        Data on marine pollution are relatively limited compared to other types of pollution data due
to the complexity and the high cost of data collection. In 1987, MOE classified the national coastal areas
into three classes according to their uses and established water quality standards. Class I is for fisheries
where COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) must be not more than 1 mg/I. COD for Class II (for
swimming and recreation) must be not more than 2 mg/l while that of Class III (for industrial use and
harbors) must be not more than 4 mg/l. Data collected from 10 monitoring stations around the country
showed that the water quality in most coastal areas are of Classes II or III and high pollution was
observed in some areas where waste treatment facilities are inadequate such as in Masan, Chinhae, Ulsan,
Gwangyang, Gunsane, and Mokpo. Because most urban and industrial development is in the coastal
zone, about 80% of the total marine pollutants originate from land-based sources, but rapidly expanding
marine transport activities and marine accidents, oil spills, transport of hazardous substances, and
discharges of solid waste and waste water including bilge oil compound the problem.



- 9 -
2.7        Due to deep water and fast tidal movement along the east coast, serious marine pollution
in the East Sea is not expected. In the Yellow Sea and the South Sea, however, the shallow waters and
slow tidal movements limit dilution and result in rapid degradation of the water quality. The pollution
in the Yellow Sea is a major regional environmental issue and is a high priority in Korea's efforts to
cooperate on global conservation. Korea's UNCED Report characterizes marine pollution of the Yellow
Sea and trans-boundary air pollution as the two "imminent environmental problems". The Yellow Sea is
one of the most important and sensitive marine ecosystems. It is experiencing extensive development
along the west coast of Korea and the east coast of China, but more basic marine data are needed to
facilitate its effective protection.
2.8        The Government has recognized the need to improve the protection and conservation of both
coastal and international marine waters, through strict regulation of pollution discharge from coastal
industrial and urban areas and upgraded sanitary sewage facilities, improved industrial waste management
and participation in various international agreements. Several initiatives have already been taken
including installation of sewage and waste water treatment facilities as well as used oil reception
equipment on Korean vessels. Technology and equipment have been developed for monitoring and
inspection of vessels and marine facilities and to cope with polluting accidents, such as oil spills, but they
are not yet widely used. Marine conditions, including the quality of the sea water, are monitored by
remote sensing technology.
2.9        Korea is a signatory to Annexes I and II (oily waters and chemically contaminated and
noxious liquids) of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of Marine Waters 73/78
(MARPOL) and has incorporated most of Annex V (garbage and solid wastes) obligations into the
national legislation. Under this Convention, ships are permitted to discharge wastes at sea only under
controlled conditions (e.g. water from oil tankers may not contain more than 15 mg/L of hydrocarbons),
and ports are to provide facilities for the reception, treatment and disposal of ships' wastes.
2.10        In March 1991, Korea enacted National Law No 4365 for the Prevention of Marine
Pollution. Article 46 of the law states that KMPA should prepare and maintain reception facilities for
oil and other pollution material and to treat effluent from ships. Refineries have established such oil
reception facilities at Pusan, Ulsan, Yeosu, Pohang and Inchon Ports where crude oil tankers berth.
Currently, there are five private companies that receive ships' oily waste in major ports like Pusan and
Ulsan, but ports in Korea do not routinely have the facilities to collect and dispose of the sewage, garbage
and/or chemically contaminated wastes from ships. Further environmental concerns relate to the need
for rapid response to shipping accidents and related spills, the disposal of dredging spoil and the need to
take into consideration environmental criteria in port development plans and operating procedures. The
project has components involved with the installation of ship waste disposal facilities, the implementation
of a vessel traffic management system to reduce ship accidents, loss of life and oil spills, and training and
technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of KMPA and KCTA to address environmental issues (see
para 3.3).

III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.1      The primary objectives of the proposed project are to help address the major environmental
concerns in Korean maritime transport, to reduce the level of noise, air pollution and traffic congestion
in the City of Pusan, and to strengthen the Korea Maritime and Port Administration's (KMPA) capacity
to deal with environmental issues during port development and operation.
B. Rationale for the Bank's Involvement
3.2      The project was specifically mentioned in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented
to the Board on December 23, 1993. The Bank's involvement is a natural progression of its contribution
to the development of Korea's port system and meets the goal of ensuring the incorporation of
environmental considerations, technology transfer and institutional reform in the development of transport
infrastructure. Through the project, the Bank would provide comprehensive support for environmental
issues in port and harbor development as illustrated through the site selection process and economic
evaluation of the Dadaepo Port, the focus on compliance with the MARPOL conversion, the approach
to vessel traffic safety and the concern for the ecosystem of the Yellow Sea.
C. Project Description
3.3      The proposed project consists of the following components:
(a)   Ship Waste Disposal Facilities
The proposed project will finance the construction of facilities for the collection, storage,
treatment and disposal of liquid wastes, garbage and sewage from ships.
The required facilities will be provided at a number of ports strategically located throughout
Korea in order to form a network of facilities that would be able to serve the entire maritime
sector and collect and treat virtually all of the liquid wastes, garbage and sewage generated by
the ships using Korean waters. Since the majority of waste material is produced by smaller
coastal vessels, consideration will be given to developing a "hub" system at moderate sized
ports around Korea. KMPA will provide the necessary facilities, to supplement those being
implemented under the project, for the remainder of Korea's ports.
(b)   Construction of the Port of Dadaepo
A nine-berth port complex with 1940m of linear wharves will be constructed at Dadaepo on
the outskirts of the City of Pusan by KMPA for the handling of timber and marine products
and other general cargo. The port will have an estimated annual cargo handling capacity of
four million tons. The loan will assist KMPA in financing the construction of the breakwater,
the dredging and the preparation of the channel. KMPA will finance the reclamation and
construction costs for the wharves and the adjacent industrial complex from its own resources.
However, KMPA is considering financing the port and industrial complex, under arrangements



- 11 -
satisfactory to the Bank, through a joint venture established by the various private companies
that will relocate their existing industrial operations from the center of Pusan to Dadaepo.
Currently, the timber and marine cargoes are unloaded at the port facilities located in the
center of the City and transported by truck through the City to the processing plants which are
frequently located in residential areas. In an attempt to rationalize the land use pattern in the
City, Pusan City Government (PCG) has decided to develop industrial areas, such as Dadaepo,
on the outskirts of the City, and to relocate polluting industrial companies from their current
locations in the residential parts of the City. The Dadaepo Port and industrial complex will
be used to accommodate about 40% of the City's present timber processing plants and about
30% of the marine products processing plants. A new road is being constructed to connect
the port-cum-industrial complex to the City's arterial highway network so that the existing
streets in the area will not become congested by the increased truck traffic. By moving the
handling of timber and marine products away from the main port facility, and by relocating
many of the timber and marine product processing plants to the new industrial complex, the
City's traffic congestion and air and noise pollution will be reduced, and the quality of living
in the residential areas from which the plants will be relocated will improve significantly.
The PCG has had a policy of relocating the City's industrial facilities to designated locations
for many years, but the lack of available land has delayed its implementation. The relocation
of the timber and fish processing plants from their present locations to Dadaepo will be
welcomed by the residents because it will improve the living conditions in the City and
increase property values in the areas from which the plants relocate. The plant operators will
also benefit from the reduction in the cost to transport raw materials, especially timber, to the
existing plants located far from the port. This component will result in some resettlement of
residents and the loss of income to local business (para 3.25).
(c)   Vessel Traffic Management Systems (VTMS)
As a safety measure and to provide better control and co-ordination, the loan will finance the
development and installation of a traffic management system to monitor, regulate and control
the movements of vessels at the ports of Pusan and Inchon/Asan. When the system has been
tested and found satisfactory, it will be replicated at other ports by KMPA. The system would
reduce the number of ship accidents, increase safety of navigation, and improve the
environmental conditions of Korean waters.
(d)   Development of Container Terminal
KCTA is constructing four container berths 1400m long and 530m wide, originally designed
as common user berths with a designed capacity of 1,200,000 TEUs, in Pusan (Phase IV
Terminal) with local funds. Each of the berths will be a self contained operating unit with its
own supporting container stacking area, container freight station, maintenance shop and
terminal office. The berths will have a draft of 15m. and will be capable of accommodating
vessels up to 50,000 dead weight ton (DWT). This will be the last phase of container berth
development in Pusan. Upon completion, the berths will be leased to private terminal
operators (para 3.4). Each of the four container berths being constructed will be equipped



- 12 -
with two quay side container cranes. The loan will help finance the procurement of these
container cranes.
The limitation to port development in Pusan is dictated by environmental considerations and
spatial constraints as well as in response to the pattern of primary traffic flows. Pusan's inland
transportation network is already severely congested with serious air pollution caused by heavy
port truck traffic. The city's mountainous terrain makes expansion of the road network
impracticable and prohibitive in terms of cost. Since only 40% of the total cargo handled
through Pusan is for its immediate hinterland, to ensure that the development is
environmentally sustainable, the number of berths that will be developed in Pusan will be
limited to four. Further development of additional container handling facilities will be
undertaken by the private sector in Kwangyang Bay.
(e)   Technical Assistance And Training
(i)   Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem
In of-der to fully address the multiple man-made disturbances now affecting the Yellow
Sea Large Marine Ecosystem (LME), a comprehensive program for marine monitoring
and assessment will be established. The program will monitor pollution, ecosystem
productivity, biodiversity and changes in yields of living marine resources. Information
collected will be used to construct quantitative indices to provide an overall assessment
of the health of the LME, as well as a means to monitor changes in living marine
resources and their environment. The loan will finance the program including the
provision of monitoring equipment and training for the staff of the Korea Ocean
Research and Development Institute (KORDI). (See Annex 1).
(ii)  Ship Waste Disposal Facilities
Technical assistance will be provided to formulate and evaluate investment options,
policies and strategies relating to the collection, storage, treatment and disposal of ship
wastes. The study will recommend a method to recover the cost of the investments and
the operations and maintenance of the facilities including the role of the private sector,
and propose institutional and organizational options for the successful implementation
of the facilities. The study will also develop detailed engineering designs for the main
elements of the reception facilities at the recommended locations. (See Annex 2).
(iii)  Environmental Training
The enhancement of the knowledge of KMPA staff on environmental aspects of port
development, construction and operation will be provided through a comprehensive
training program combining a local program with overseas visits. The training program
will be developed and implemented in conjunction with the Ministry of Environment.
(See Annex 3) Assurances were obtained at negotiations that KMPA will submit a
proposal to the Bank identifying the participants and programs for the extended study



- 13 -
portion of the environmental training program no later than November 1 of the year
preceding the training.
(iv)  Operational and Technical Training
Fifty (50) man months of professional training will be financed by the project to further
develop the engineering and operational staff of KMPA. The program will consist
primarily of extended studies conducted at various overseas locations. The annual
program will be developed in consultation with the Bank, and assurances were obtained
during negotiations that KMPA will submit a proposal to the Bank identifying the
participants and program for the operational and technical training program no later
than November I of the year preceding the training.
(v) Institutional Development
Initiatives will be pursued with local financing and monitored by the Bank to: (a)
develop a system to privatize the multi-purpose terminals at all 27 international ports;
(b) develop an improved system of performance agreements between KMPA, KCTA
and the various terminal operating companies; (c) develop the means within KMPA to
better manage and coordinate the maritime environmental improvement program; and
(d) prepare standard operating procedures and engineering designs to be used to retrofit
existing port facilities to minimize the pollution caused by port operations.
Private Sector Participation
3.4      An integral part of the project is the involvement of private sector interests in the management
and operation of ship waste disposal facilities and in the development, management and operation of the
new Dadaepo port-cum-industrial complex and container terminal handling facilities in Pusan and
Kwangyang Bay. Private sector participation in the waste disposal facilities may take the form of a
management or operating lease, and, in the case of the Dadaepo complex, through direct financing and
development of the whole of the complex with the exception of the breakwater (including the revetments)
and the navigation channel. The berths under construction in Pusan Phase IV will be leased to terminal
operators investing in the development of Kwangyang Bay Port as part of the package, developed in
conjunction with the Bank during project preparation, to promote private sector participation in the port
sub-sector. The latter development will be financed from the proceeds of the sale of bonds issued by
KCTA and guaranteed by the Government for the construction of the facilities at Kwangyang Bay. The
bond issue carries with it the right of the buyer to operate and manage one container berth each at
Kwangyang Bay and Pusan Phase IV. The terms and conditions of the bond issue and of the leases for
the management and operation of the berths have been finalized taking into account the advice and
comments of the Bank. The Government has also decided that the multi-purpose/general cargo berths
would also be progressively leased to the private sector. Detailed arrangements for the leases are in the
process of being formulated by KMPA.
lmroving Institutional Performance
3.5      To improve financial accountability, KMPA was recently made financially autonomous with
the establishment of a Port Special Account in which all port related earnings would be retained and from



- 14 -
which all port capital spending would be met (para 5.4). Lease arrangements between KCTA, PCTOC,
and PECT have also been restructured to promote higher berth throughput. To further improve the
management and operational capability in the port sub-sector for handling containerized cargo,
performance agreements, which will include key measures of performance, are being developed in
conjunction with Bank staff.
D. Cost Estimates
3.6       The total project cost is estimated at W937.7 billion or US$1,106.9 million equivalent with
a direct and indirect foreign exchange component of W266.0 billion or US$314.0 million equivalent,
including taxes and duties estimated at US$115.7 million equivalent. The cost of civil works is based
on quantities calculated from preliminary engineering designs, costed at current market prices and
checked against prices of actual similar works. The cost of equipment is based on prices quoted by
manufacturers and suppliers in recent bids for the procurement of similar equipment executed with Bank
financing. The cost of consulting services is estimated on the basis of recent fees charged by foreign and
local consultants for services similar in nature and scope. Detailed cost estimates are found in Tables 1
to 5 and are summarized below:

E. Financing Plan
3.7            The Bank loan of US$100 million, representing about 9.0%  of the total project cost or
about 31.8% of the foreign exchange cost, will be made to the Government and will be used to finance
the foreign exchange cost of the breakwater at Dadaepo, the procurement of equipment for the reception
and treatment of ship wastes, the VTMS, and container quay cranes for Pusan Phase IV and the provision
of technical assistance and training. Retroactive financing amounting to US$0.2 million would be



- 15 -
provided to meet the cost of consulting services for the feasibility and detailed engineering of the ship
waste disposal facilities. The Government is considering financing from the private sector to develop the
port and industrial complex at Dadaepo, at an estimated amount of US$336.8 million, or provide the
funds from its own resources. The remaining foreign and local costs will be financed by KMPA, MOST
and KCTA for the components belonging to each respective agency.

F. Status of Preparation
Ship Waste Disposal Facilities
3.9           KMPA has contracted with the Korean Maritime Training and Research Institute to
prepare the feasibility study for the reception and treatment of oily water and chemical/noxious wastes
at the 27 international ports of Korea. Preliminary investigations were completed in June 1992. A
feasibility study for all 27 ports is scheduled to be completed by December 1994 and followed by the
preparation of detailed design work for the selected ports to be completed by July 1995. Terms of
reference for the study are found in Annex 2.
Vessel Traffic Management System
3.10          The preliminary feasibility study for the VTMS was completed in October 1993. Detailed
design work commenced in April 1994, and to be completed by January 1995.



- 16 -
Yellow Sea Larye Marine Ecosystem
3.11         The detailed work program has been prepared jointly with officials from the respective
Korean and Chinese (the State Oceanic Administration of China) agencies, and procurement of the
monitoring equipment and preparation of the TORs for the training program can be started in the middle
of 1994.
Construction of the Port of Dadaepo
3.12          The feasibility study including the EIA was completed in November 1993. Detailed
engineering for the development which commenced in December 1993 is expected to be completed by
December 1994. Preparation of bidding documents for the construction of the breakwater is scheduled
to start in January 1995.
Development of Pusan Phase IV Container Terminal
3.13         Four container berths are under construction. Reclamation of land for the back-up area
is also underway. The whole development (berths, stacking yards, CFS, etc) is expected to be completed
by the end of 1997. The bid documents for the procurement of the container handling equipment are
under preparation by KCTA and are expected to be completed by December 1994.
Technical Assistance and Training
3.14         Terms of reference for the study and preparation of the detailed designs for reception and
treatment of ship waste have been prepared and agreed to (See Annex 2). An environmental training
program and the terms of reference to prepare the program have also been agreed upon (See Annex 3).
The program for the monitoring and assessment of the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem is in the
process of being finalized.
G. Implementation
3.15         Project components relating to the improvement of the environment and the relocation
of timber and marine products processing plants to Dadaepo by the private sector will be the
responsibility of Port Development Division in KMPA (para 3.3 (a), (b), (c), and (e) (ii - v)). KCTA
will be responsible for the development of Pusan Phase IV and the procurement of container handling
equipment (para 3.3 (d)). MOST will be responsible for the study of the Yellow Sea LME (para 3.3 (e)
(i)), but the work will be contracted, on a sole source basis, to the Korean Ocean Research &
Development Institute (KORDI) in view of the specialized nature of the work. KORDI will be assisted
by consultants in selected aspects of the prograrn. Consultants will be engaged to assist in the feasibility
study and detailed engineering for the ship waste disposal facilities. Overseas training for the staff will
be undertaken in agreement with the Bank.
3.16         The project is expected to be completed by the end of 1999 with a loan closing date of
December 31, 2000. The implementation plan and schedule developed by the implementing agencies is
shown in Table 6.

H. Procurement
3.17          Procurement arrangements for the project take into account the experience gained from
previous Bank Group-financed port projects. The Bank's standard bidding documents will be used for
procurement financed by the Bank under the project.
3.18          Procurement under the project will be carried out as shown in the following table. The
figures in parentheses represent the amounts to be financed by the Bank. All figures include estimated
physical and price contingencies and are rounded.

NBF = Not Bank-Financed
3.19          Civil works in respect of the breakwater at Dadaepo estimated to cost US$158.27 million
and major items of equipment and goods (for container handling, vessel traffic management, and the ship
waste disposal facilities) with an estimated aggregate cost of US$72.00 million will be procured following
international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. However, a few items of standardized equipment
estimated to cost not more than US$300,000 per contract and in an aggregate amount not exceeding
US$3.0 million, where foreign bidders are not expected to be interested, may be procured by local
competitive bidding (LCB) acceptable to the Bank. Further, items or groups of items covering minor
pieces of equipment for environmental protection purposes estimated to cost less than US$200,000 per
contract and in an aggregate amount not exceeding US$3.0 million may be procured following
international and local shopping procedures on the basis of a comparison of price quotationssolicited from
at least three eligible suppliers in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for procurement. Planned
procurement packaging is shown in Table 7. Civil works and equipment not financed by the Bank
estimated at US$832.01 million and US$35 million respectively are being procured following local
procedures.



- 18 -
3.20         Prequalification of contractors for civil works in respect of the breakwater for the
Dadaepo Port complex, and of suppliers for the ship waste disposal facilities and the VTMS will be
undertaken in advance of bidding to ensure that invitations to bid are extended only to qualified bidders.
All contracts exceeding US$300,000 for the procurement of works and goods, US$100,000 for firms and
US$50,000 for individual consulting services, financed from the proceeds of the loan will be subject to
prior review by the Bank. This would represent about 95 % of the estimated amount of contracts financed
by the Bank or 21 % of all contracts under the project. Under ICB, qualifying domestic manufacturers
will be eligible for a margin of preference in the comparison of bids of 15% (or the prevailing rate of
customs duties, whichever is lower) for goods. All consultants financed from the proceeds of the loan
will be selected and employed under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants except for the Yellow Sea LME program which will be
executed by KORDI (para 3.15) which will also undertake the procurement of instruments and equipment
and the engagement of consultants required for the program on a reimbursable basis.
I. Disbursements
3.21         Disbursements from the loan will cover:
(a)    35 % of total expenditure in respect of civil works for the breakwater at Dadaepo;
(b)    100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment, 100% of local
expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured equipment, and 75% of local
expenditures for other items procured locally; and
(c)    100% of expenditures for consulting services and training.
3.22         To facilitate disbursement against eligible expenditures, a Special Account will be opened
for KMPA with an authorized allocation of US$4.0 million which is the average expenditure for a four-
month period, in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. Application for replenishment of the Special
Account will be submitted regularly, preferably monthly, or when the amount is drawn down by 30%,
whichever occurs first. A schedule of estimated disbursements, which takes into consideration the
disbursement profile for transport projects in Korea, is given in Table 8. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that no disbursements will be made with respect to the Dadaepo component until KMPA
provides the Bank with satisfactory evidence that the EIA has been approved by MOE for Dadaepo.
3.23         Disbursements will be made against full documentation except for small contracts for civil
works and equipment worth less than US$300,000 each and for costs incurred for training and for
contracts not exceeding $100,000 for consulting firms and not exceeding $50,000 for individual
consultants which may be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOE). Documentation
supporting SOEs will be retained by the implementing agency (KMPA) and will be made available for
review by Bank supervision missions and audited annually by independent auditors (para 1.18).



- 19 -
J. Reporting, Monitoring and Supervision
3.24         In addition to field supervision missions, of which at least two a year will be undertaken
during the initial period of project implementation, the progress of execution of the project will be
monitored through biannual progress reports submitted to the Bank by KMPA, KCTA and MOST in
respect of project components for which each of the agencies is responsible. An outline of the report is
presented in Annex 4. The focus of Bank supervision efforts in the first year would be on the
procurement of works and equipment and the measures to be taken to reduce pollution in port waters.
Annex 5 summarizes the supervision mission plan for the project, and the project monitoring indicators
are presented in Annex 6. During project implementation, the Bank's supervision staff would also
monitor efforts to promote the participation of the private sector in the port system, to establish an
environmental unit in KMPA, institutional development and financial and operating performances of
KMPA and KCTA. Upon completion of the project, the Government, KMPA, KCTA and MOST will
prepare implementation completion report not later than six months after the loan closing date.
K. Resettlement
3.25          Under the project, very few house and land owners are affected. The only project
component with any anticipated resettlement concerns the construction of the port-cum-industrial facility
at Dadaepo. The resettlement and rehabilitation of the affected people will be done in accordance with
the Bank's policies [OD 4.30]. The amount of involuntary resettlement, therefore, has been minimized
through the design of the complex and the location of the roads. In addition, the compensation to be
provided to the affected people should be sufficient to replace all lost assets and income opportunities so
that the affected people will be able to improve, or, at a minimum, restore their former living standards
and income earning capacity. Resettlement compensation at Dadaepo is required, in an amount estimated
to be W15 billion, for three houses which serve as both dwellings and small beach side restaurants, eight
other vacant lots totaling about 90,000 sq.m., and three mariculture farms raising seafood and covering
an area of 650ha. Compensation for the lost income for the businesses referred to above and for an
additional twenty-five shops/buildings located in the area is estimated at about W13 billion. In
accordance with Korean legislation, (see Annex 7) compensation for property was determined by
independent professional valuations, and represents a 40% premium over comparative October 1993
market prices. Compensation for the loss of income from the businesses was computed to cover earnings
over an eight year period for those businesses directly affected by the project. For those businesses that
are indirectly affected, the compensation will be 30% of the earnings over a 2.5 year period. When
resettlement actually takes place, compensation would be adjusted to reflect any increase or valuation of
the assets. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the affected people shall be consulted and
participate in the design and implementation of the resettlement activities, and that at least 30 days prior
to their displacement, each affected person shall be provided with a compensation package, in cash or
in kind, sufficient to ensure that each person shall improve or at least regain, the standard of living and
means of livelihood they were enjoying prior to their displacement. In addition, each compensation
package shall include (a) compensation for the assets lost, or at least, at replacement costs; and (b)
adequate subsistence allowance during the transition period of resettlement.

L. Environmental Impact
3.26         In Korea, the Basic Environmental Policy Law (BEPL) requires that an environmental
impact assessment (EIA) be prepared prior to the construction of such structures as port facilities and
industrial complexes. The EIA guidelines, issued by the Ministry of Environment (MOE), require,
among other things, public consultation prior to approval of such projects by MOE.  Public
announcements are made through newspapers and public notices, and the EIA report is exhibited for
public review and comment for 20 days. Results of the consultation are considered during the preparation
of the final report and the comments and opinions of individuals and concerned agencies are documented
in the report. The EIA process and guidelines used in Korea have been reviewed and found to be
satisfactory.
3.27         The EIA studies of the Dadaepo and Pusan Phase IV components were carried out and
the English summary of the reports were submitted to the Bank. The reports and other related
information were reviewed during appraisal and found to be satisfactory. The results are presented in
Annex 8 along with a more complete discussion of the process and results. The EIA approval for the
Pusan Phase IV component was obtained in December 1992.
3.28          Implementation of these components would have significant positive impacts on both the
economy and the environment. The Dadaepo component was developed and the site selected because of
its location far from the city center and near existing large industrial areas. The relocation of many of
the timber and fish processing factories to this port/industrial complex from their existing facilities
scattered throughout the city would reduce the level of truck traffic and the risk of traffic accidents due
to transportation of timber and fish products from the port. It would also reduce the levels of air and
noise pollution and other nuisances in the areas from which the plants relocate. The expansion of the
existing container handling facilities with the Pusan Phase IV component will provide more on-dock space
which will facilitate the closing of many of the off-dock container yards located in the City and the related
truck traffic.
3.29          Dadaepo has been designated as an industrial area for many years. In 1992, soon after
KMPA had proposed to develop a new port/industrial complex at Dadaepo, a site analysis was started
which focused on three possible sites for the port. The initial studies determined that the least cost
solution would be to construct the port and the industrial complex on reclaimed land in the Nakdong
River. The second best site, Dadaepo Bay, was far more expensive due to the depth of the water and
the more limited amount of space available for the industrial complex. MOE overruled the first proposal
since the Nakdong River area is protected by law as a natural preservation area. After lengthy
discussions, it was agreed that the complex would be constructed in the Bay and up to the boundary of
the natural preservation area under three conditions: no encroachment of the natural preservation
boundary, no port activity along the Nakdong River side, and no waste water runoff into the Nakdong
River. The basic design for the component was made based on this agreement. No separate site analysis
was conducted for the Pusan Phase IV component since the site is in an industrial/port area and it was
identified several years ago as the location for the next container terminal.
3.30         The assessment of the major negative impacts and the proposed mitigation measures for
these two components were reviewed and found to be satisfactory. The impacts during construction and
reclamation for both components are basically similar and the proposed mitigation measures are
acceptable. The proposed procedures to minimize the generation and impact of air, noise and water



- 21 -
pollution are commonly used in Korea (control truck speed and work hours, prohibit the use of horns,
plant trees, install sound proof walls, use pump dredges, install silt protector, etc.). The impacts at the
existing quarry sites for rock and soil would be controlled under separate EIAs for each specific site.
The impact due to sea sand excavation would be small since the area is located far away from the natural
preservation area. The levels of Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn in the bottom sediments taken from Pusan and Dadaepo
Bays are slightly higher than the "reference values" specified in the Netherlands standards and careful
consideration regarding selection of the disposal site should be required. Since most of the dredged spoil
from the Pusan Phase IV has been used for reclamation, contamination in other disposal sites is not
expected. For Dadaepo Bay, the level of contamination would be carefully studied and measures taken
to minimize the sediment disturbance during dredging. Disposal sites and the disposal methods would
be done in accordance with MOE requirements.
3.31         During operation, the impacts and mitigation measures due to operation of the port
facilities for both components are again basically similar. All waste would be managed according to the
waste management plan of the City of Pusan and contractors would be assigned. Waste water would be
collected and treated before being discharged. At Dadaepo, a separate waste water treatment facility
would be constructed and the discharge would be monitored regularly. Marine water quality and air and
noise pollution would be monitored according to the plan agreed upon by MOE.
3.32         Possible impacts on the Nakdong River and the mitigation measures are considered
acceptable. Discharge of all kind of waste into the river would be prohibited. A 30m greenbelt would
be constructed along the west boundary. To minimize the generation of air, noise, and odor and their
impacts on the residents, effective pollution control facilities would be installed as required by MOE and
PCG. A 30m buffer zone would also be created near the residential area. Assurance were obtained at
negotiations that KMPA would be required to submit to the Bank the monitoring results/reports which
are required by MOE for the Dadaepo component by March 31 of each year starting in 1996.
3.33         The consultation and compensation process was reviewed and found to be satisfactory.
The consultation for Dadaepo was carried out twice: once during site selection and another during the
preparation of the final EIA report. Attempts were made to minimize the need for resettlement, to create
a forum for discussion, and to offer an opportunity for the residents to participate in the project. For the
Pusan Phase IV component, KMPA/KCTA and the affected fishermen and women divers negotiated the
compensation based on an assessment prepared by the Marine Research Institute and National Fisheries
University of Pusan. A total of about W232 million ($290,000) was paid to 16 fishermen and 8 women
divers in July-December 1992. No public complaints have been received during the construction of this
component. KCTA submitted the post-environmental management and results of the monitoring to the
MOE Pusan Regional Office by the end of March 1994. Assurances were obtained at negotiation that
KCTA would be required to submit to the Bank the monitoring results/reports as required by MOE for
the Phase IV Container Terminal by March 31 of each year starting in 1996.
3.34         The existing capacity of KMPA and KCTA to deal with the environmental issues related
to the port construction and operation, including monitoring, needs to be strengthened as soon as possible.
A training program has been developed and agreed upon as part of the technical assistance component
of the project (Annex 3). In addition, technical assistance will be provided in the project to develop
sample TORs for EIA studies, and standard operating procedures and engineering guidelines will be
prepared to retrofit existing port facilities to minimize the pollution caused by port operations (para 3.3
(e)(v)).

IV. ECONOMIC VALUATION
A. Project Justification
4.1        The justification of this Project is based on: (i) supporting the Government's program to
improve Pusan's urban environment and improve the quality of life of the city's population by: (a)
relocating port activities (timber and fish processing) as well as storage of containers to more appropriate
areas; (b) development of a more comprehensive approach to land use, whereby residential areas are rid
of polluting and environmentally disruptive industries; (c) development of appropriately located industrial
zones to bring together similar activities, thereby increasing overall efficiencies and reducing
environmental damage; and (d) limiting expansion of the Port of Pusan and redirecting future growth
elsewhere; (ii) improving Korea's coastal marine environment by constructing suitable facilities to collect
and process the wastes produced by ships; and (iii) improving port safety through a pilot project to
control and coordinate vessel movements.
B. Project Benefits
4.2        The most significant project benefits are those related to environmental improvements in the
City of Pusan. Relocation of approximately 130 timber processing and 107 fish processing plants from
the inner city's residential areas to the industrial sites at Dadaepo, will reduce truck traffic (and thus
congestion, pollution and traffic accidents), and replace some of the polluting industrial activities with
residential development.
4.3        The completion of Phase IV Container Terminal in Pusan, which will have a substantial on-
dock container yard and the Yangsan Inland Container Depot (ICD), which started construction in June
1994, will benefit the environment by providing more space to store and process containers in and out
of the Port and eliminate the need for virtually all of the existing 34 off-dock facilities which are presently
scattered throughout the city and are significant contributors to Pusan's growing environmental problems
(traffic congestion, pollution and safety). Finally, the implementation of the ship waste disposal facilities
component will improve Korea's marine eco-system, not only in those ports and harbors where such
facilities will be developed, but also in those cities and adjacent coastlines in which these ports are
located, and which are affected by activities of both foreign and domestic vessels.
4.4        More generally, the environmental disruption to the well being of Pusan's population, caused
by the continuous and rapid growth of the port, have led Korean officials to approve the development of
a new container port, Kwangyang Bay (about 150 km south west of Pusan), and limit future expansion
of the existing port at Pusan in order to improve the city's social and physical environment (See Annex
1). The project components are part of this master plan to clean-up the city of disruptive port and port-
related industrial and processing activities, and relocate them to more appropriate areas outside of the city
center.
4.5        In addition to the environmental improvements noted above, other benefits include improved
operational efficiencies and cost savings due to increased economies of agglomeration brought about by
the relocation of timber and fish processing plants now scattered throughout Pusan into a single industrial
area; improved marine safety and decision-making capabilities brought about by the introduction of the



- 23 -
Vessel Traffic Management System (VTMS); and increased handling capacity resulting from the
development of Phase IV Container Terminal in Pusan Port.
C. Present and Future Traffic
4.6         The rapid growth of traffic at Pusan Port has been slowed due, in part, to port congestion,
and, in part, to a slowdown in the Korean economy between 1989 and 1991. However, the average
annual increase was 7.8% between 1980 and 1985 and 8.2% between 1986 and 1992. In 1992 the port
handled a total of 65 million tons, with general cargo accounting for 35% of total tonnage. Forty-seven
percent of the traffic was outbound. Sixty-five percent of the traffic in Pusan Port is now containerized,
with 3% accounting for trans-shipment (see Table 9: Historical Traffic Volumes).
4.7        Timber and Fish Traffic Presently about 20% of all timber shipments into Korea are
handled through terminals in Pusan Port, and about 90% of the cargo is in the form of raw timber. The
volume of raw timber has increased 3.7% annually between 1986 and 1992. The forecast anticipates that
the growth rate will be about 4% between 1996 - 2001. Thereafter, virtually no growth is anticipated.
(see Table 10: Past and Forecast Timber Traffic by Place of Origin 1986-2011). Due to a limited amount
of space, most of the timber traffic is handled by lighterage, which increases port congestion and creates
problems for the efficient handling of other cargo, including containers. Because of Pusan's importance
as a timber port there is a thriving timber processing industry in the city. Presently there are over 300
timber processing plants located in various parts of the city, with about 150 of them in residential areas.
Their location outside of the immediate port area (average distance is 13.2 km from the port), generates
approximately 700 truck trips per day, much of it through the center of the city.
4.8        Currently, the Port of Pusan handles about 84% of Korea's fish traffic, with Masan handling
15% and Mokpo and Chungmu together handling the remainder. The growth of fish traffic in Pusan has
increased at an average annual rate of 7 % between 1980 and 1992 (see Table I 1: Past and Forecast Fish
Traffic). Much of the cargo remains uncontainerized, although this is gradually changing. In 1992, out
of a total 678,000 tons handled, 56% was containerized. In Pusan, there are a total of about 350 fish
processing plants, 130 in residential districts. Most are an average distance of 5.7 km from the port and
generate approximately 130 truck trips per day.
4.9        Container Traffic  Nationally, container traffic grew at an average annual rate of 5%
between 1988 and 1992. In Pusan, this average was slightly higher registering a 6% annual growth (see
Table 12: Container Traffic in Pusan Port). Pusan Port remains Korea's main container port, handling
95% of all containers in 1992, with Inchon a distant second at 4%, followed by Masan and Ulsan. In
1992 Pusan handled 2.6 million TEUs, with 67% handled at the port's container facilities and the
remainder at the general cargo terminals. However, due to the lack of sufficient on-dock container
facilities at the port site, off-dock facilities have been developed privately to service this need. They are
located throughout the city, far removed from the port site. With the construction of the Phase IV
Container Terminal and the ICD outside of Pusan, it is estimated that the demand for the off-dock
container yards will decline sharply resulting in a reduction of approximately 1600 truck trips per day,
generated by container traffic to these off-dock facilities.
4.10       Recent forecasts developed by KMI suggest a national growth rate for container traffic of
8% between 1996 and 2001, and 6.5% between 2002 and 2011 (see Table 13: Forecast Container
Traffic). In Pusan, forecast growth for container traffic is 2.5% between 1996 and 2001, and 4% between



- 24 -
2002 and 2011, with port facilities (including Dadaepo and Phase IV) reaching capacity in 2000 of 81.6
million rt. Container traffic in Kwangyang Bay is forecast to grow at an annual rate of about 25%
between 1996 and 2001 and 10% between 2002 and 2011. Given the expected volume of container traffic
(total of 6.4 million TEUs in 2001 and 11.4 million TEUs in 2011) the importance of the Kwangyang
Bay facilities becomes critical to continued container traffic growth. By the year 2011, it is projected that
Kwangyang Bay will handle about 5.3 million TEUs annually (4.1 million TEUs of import/export traffic
and the remainder trans-shipment and coastal traffic), and Pusan 5.0 million TEUs. With containerized
cargo growing to 70% of all traffic in Pusan, shifts in use of port space are expected to occur. This will
allow more container traffic to be handled than would otherwise have been possible. Although the forecast
assumes growth in trans-shipment traffic (both container and general cargo), the proportion is not
expected to surpass 20% of total traffic by 2011. With these assumptions the following growth rates have
been developed, and are used in the economic evaluation:

D. Economic Analysis
4.11         The costs and benefits have been evaluated in constant March 1994 prices. Financial cost
estimates were converted to economic costs by excluding taxes, duties and price contingencies. Included
in the cost estimates are: port construction costs; port operating and maintenance costs; compensation
costs associated with resettlement; and environmental cost associated with decreased land value of the area
adjacent to the new port and port related facilities at Dadaepo. With regard to the investments in the
Pusan Phase IV Container Terminal, the economic analysis of the identified costs and benefits was
prepared using traditional techniques for valuing and analyzing transportation projects. However, with
respect to the investments in the Port of Dadaepo and the related industrial area, the traditional techniques
used in transportation projects were supplemented with measures designed to quantify the environmental
costs and benefits associated with the component. An explanation of the procedures employed in this
environmental economic analysis are discussed in Annex 11, Methodologies for Determining
Environmental Costs and Benefits of Port Projects. The composite EIRR for the project is estimated to



- 25 -
be 33.3 %. (see Tables 14-16). More detailed discussions of the economic analyses (analyzed on the bases
of "with" and "without" project scenarios) of the individual components is presented below.
4.12          Port of Dadaepo. In addition to the costs associated with the construction, maintenance
and operation of the various project components (see paras 3.3), there are a number of environmental and
resettlement costs directly related to the selection of the site for the Port of Dadaepo (Cove alternative).
The site, located west of the existing Pusan Port complex, is presently used for fishing, small business
activities and recreational purposes. Construction of the port facility will adversely impact these activities
and significantly reduce the present pleasant appearance of the cove. Residential land values in the
surrounding area, in particular, will be negatively impacted, with a resultant decrease in total economic
residential land value estimated at W109 billion. In addition, construction of the Dadaepo Port and
industrial facility will also impact about 28 households, affecting their income earning abilities. Those
affected (mainly fishermen and their families) will, however, receive an estimated W28 billion as
compensation (See Annex 10). These costs have been considered in the calculation of the EIRR presented
below.
4.13          The benefits which have been quantified in the Dadaepo analysis include both traditional
and environmental benefits. The traditional case includes: (a) savings in ship waiting time; (b) inland
transport cost savings; and (c) savings in cargo handling. The environmental case includes: (a) reduction
of air pollution in traffic corridors; (b) time savings for travel in traffic corridors; (c) savings resulting
from reduced traffic accidents; (d) savings resulting from reduced road damage caused by truck traffic;
(e) increased residential land values resulting from the relocation of polluting timber and fish processing
plants; and (f) value of reclaimed land (see Annex 12). The EIRR for the Dadaepo component is 36.3%
with a benefit/cost ratio of 1.94.
4.14          Pusan Phase IV. In the case of the Pusan Port Phase IV component only traditional
benefits were quantified. These include: cargo handling cost savings and inland transport cost savings.
The EIRR of the Phase IV component is 25.4% with a benefit/cost ratio of 2.41.
4.15          Ship Waste Disposal Facilities. As a consequence of Korea's signature of the MARPOL
Convention and the passage of Law no.4365, every Korean port is required to provide, operate and
maintain a certain level of service for ship waste collection, treatment and disposal. The environmental
issue to be addressed nationwide is how to handle an estimated 46,000 annual tons (1992 estimate) of oily
waste and sludge stemming largely from the operation of small to medium sized coastal and fishing
vessels. In 1992 an estimated 20,000 tons were received for treatment, with the remainder presumably
dumped at sea. No separate EIRR was calculated for this component due to its size relative to the other
Project components.
4.16          Sensitivity Analyses. Sensitivity analyses were conducted separately for each of the above
project components. In the case of the Phase IV component a standard analysis was used which included
a 15% cost increase, 15% benefit decrease and 15% simultaneous cost increase/benefit decrease. The
same assumptions were also used in the Dadaepo sensitivity analysis. However, here the analysis was
expanded to gauge the project's sensitivity to environmental impacts and to compare the traditional
method of evaluation with that including environmental impacts. The results are as follows:

land reclamation 4                                  11
4.17          The results show that the Dadaepo component remains well justified as long as the main
benefit, land reclamation, value is included no matter which of the other benefits (various environmental
related factors) are excluded (see footnotes to the above table). However, in the traditional analysis,
which disregards land value changes and includes only the transport economic savings in ship waiting
time, inland transport cost savings, and cargo handling cost savings the project becomes economically
unfeasible. The above analysis indicates that the Pusan Phase IV component is well justified.
E. Risks
4.18          Other than uncertainties associated with traffic growth, the main project risks concern
policy decisions, including: (i) enforcement of the removal of the timber and fish processing plants to
Dadaepo as well as some of the off-dock facilities from the city's residential areas to on-dock and ICD
facilities and the re-zoning of these vacated areas to exclude future industrial development; and (ii) private
participation in the co-financing of both the Dadaepo and Kwangyang Bay facilities. The impact of these
potential risks on the project are not expected to be very great or to reduce the likelihood of the project
not achieving its anticipated benefits. The PCG has clearly stated its intention to transfer industrial
operations, including the off-dock container yards, to areas designated as industrial and away from areas
zoned for residential and commercial activity. The implementation of this policy has been delayed due
2 Base case, but without the increased residential land values around processing industries to be
relocated to Dadaepo (result of improved residential environmental quality).
3Includes only transport economics (costs and time) plus the value of reclaimed land for industrial
processing purposes. All environmental costs and benefits are excluded.
4All transport economics (no land reclamation value, and no environmental benefits).



- 27 -
to the lack of suitable areas to properly accommodate these operations, but with the expanded space for
the handling of container traffic with the Phase IV development and the new ICD at Yangsan and with
the new industrial space being developed at Dadaepo, sufficient land will now be available. In addition,
the private operators also have significant financial incentives to transfer to the new areas because the cost
of the land at the new locations is substantially lower than the land on which they currently operate. By
selling the land that they are currently using, they will be able to finance the construction of newer more
efficient facilities at the new location.
4.19          The risk that the private operators will be able to finance the reclamation of the land at
Dadaepo does not appear to be a concern. The operators involved in the move have formed a special
committee to manage the reclamation and construction. The costs will be financed by the companies that
have been selected to move to the Dadaepo site, and paid from the proceeds received by the companies
through the sale of the land at their existing operations. If some of the companies prove to be incapable
of financing their share of the cost, there are many other companies willing to replace them who would
have the necessary funds in order to participate in an investment with such high rate of return. The risk
associated with the financing of the new container berths at Kwangyang Bay also do not appear to be a
concern since bids on three of the four berths have already been accepted and KCTA is reporting a strong
international interest in the fourth berth.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Korea Maritime and Port Administration
A. Past Financial Performance
5.1        Historically, the operating results for KMPA have been extremely good, however, during
the four years ended in 1992, the financial performance of KMPA declined steadily. The reasons for this
overall decline in profitability can be attributed to two primary factors. The operating expenses increased
dramatically and the level of operating revenues was virtually constant. The increases in the operating
expenses are the result of two major factors. The first was an increase in salaries due to pressure from
labor to increase rates nation-wide. During this period, the total employment in KMPA increased by only
3%, but the salary expense increased by 61 %. The second reason for the large increase in operating
expenses is due to the Government's policy to revalue fixed assets to reflect market value. In 1990, the
net fixed assets increased by over 90% largely due to this revaluation, and the depreciation expense
increased by about 32% over 1989 levels. The impact of these two items was that operating expenses
grew by over 65% during this four year period.
5.2         The second major factor explaining the decline in operating profits is that operating revenues
showed virtually no growth during this four year period. This low level of growth is due to the fact that
rental income declined by almost 50% in 1991 because when KCTA was created, KMPA no longer
received the rental income from the container terminals (see paras 5.9 - 5. 1 1). This reduction in rental
income offset the increase in revenue from port facilities which grew at an annual rate of 8.7% during
this period. This growth was the result of large increases in the total tonnage shipped, but since there
were no port tariff increases during this period, the rate of growth for operating revenue was reduced.
The combined impact of the reduced operating profits and the large increase in the value of the fixed



- 28 -
assets has reduced the rate of return on net fixed assets in operation below the target level of 5% (see
para 5.8). These results are summarized below and presented in more detail in Tables 17-20.
1989       1990        1991        1992

Self Financing Ratio (%)           NA          32.9        28.7        19.9
B. Current Financial Position
5.3         The financial position of KMPA remains extremely strong. The annual net cash flow from
operations has been able to finance almost 30% of capital spending, and since KMPA is a government
agency, the Government continues to provide almost 60% of KMPA's capital investment program.
During the three years ending in 1992, the Government's net cash investment in KMPA was almost W462
billion. This very strong cash flow support has allowed KMPA to limit its borrowing program to specific
situations and to balancing out its cash flow requirements. The result is that KMPA has a very strong
capital structure with a debt to equity ratio of (1/26) or about 4% and a debt service coverage of almost
1.4 times. The current and acid test ratios are kept at low levels by the Government as efforts are made
to balance the annual cash requirements.
C. Future Financial Performance
5.4         Effective January 1, 1994, all port generated revenues will be retained in the sub-sector for
future capital investments. As part of this policy change, it has been decided to allow private operators
to bid for the exclusive use of the various multi-purpose terminals in Korea. It is expected that this
decision will be implemented at all of the 27 international ports by 1996. The Bank will work with
KMPA in the implementation of this privatization policy (para 3.3 (e)(v)). The impact of this decision
will completely change KMPA's forecasted operations by significantly increasing its operating revenues.
At this time, it is not possible to predict the actual impact, therefore, the following forecast is based on
the current operating procedures which should be indicative and should also represent a worse case
scenario. (See para 3.5).

5.5        KMPA's operating margin is projected to steadily improve throughout the period and enable
KMPA to return to the levels of profitability that it enjoyed in the 1980s. The forecast performance is
illustrated by the data below which is derived from Tables 17-20.

5.6        The operating results of KMPA for the period 1989 - 1992 were negatively impacted by the
abnormal social and economic conditions that existed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The economic
projections indicate continued growth in the economy, albeit at a slower rate than in the past, combined
with normal increases in operating expenses. Cargo tonnage is expected to grow at an annual rate of over
J%, and the average price per ton of cargo is projected to increase at an annual rate in excess of 7%.
This combination will allow KMPA's operating revenue to grow at an annual rate of over 16.3%. The
gi owth in tonnage is well supported by historic and projected trends, but the increase in the port charges
per ton is well in excess of recent trends where the Government has been very concerned about the
inflationary effect of cost increases in the transportation sector and its negative impact on the
competitiveness of Korean exports. Port tariffs were, however, increased by 5% effective January 1,
1994. This was the first tariff increase since 1990. The cargo mix will also have an impact on the
average rate. Korea currently has a high containerization rate, but all indications are that the port charges
per ton will continue to increase as containers are able to penetrate new markets. Since containers are
high priced but low tonnage cargo, the average charge per ton of cargo will increase as the amount of
container cargo increases.



- 30 -
5.7         As a result of the Government's policy of revaluing fixed assets to their market level, and
the rapid increase in the Government's capital spending program, the net fixed assets in operation are
projected to grow at an ainual rate of almost 14% during the forecast period. This rapid growth in the
value of the fixed assets in operation prevents the rate of return earned on these fixed assets from
improving during the period despite the signiticant growth in the level of profitability as can be seen from
the following table:

Rate of Return (%)           3.0         1.7         2.0      2.2       2.2
5.8        When the Government proceeds with its stated intention to privatize the operations of the
port system, KMPA will be able to reduce its operating expenses and the fees received from renting the
general and multi-purpose port facilities will increase the operating revenues. It is not possible to
accurately determine the impact of this policy change, but the privatizing of these terminals will generate
more revenue for KMPA which can then be re-invested in the sub-sector. Due the new importance of
financing the ports' capital expenditures from operations, it was agreed to use a self financing ratio to
monitor the financial condition of both KMPA and KCTA rather than the rate of return on the amount
of net fixed assets in operation. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that KMPA and KCTA
%hould each generate sufficient cash from operations so that when combined with the cash and short-term
securities on hand at January 1 of the year the total represents not less than 20% of the annual average
capital expenditures for that year and the next year for KMPA and 40% for KCTA.
Korea Container Terminal Authority
D. Operating Results
5.9        The law establishing the KCTA was passed in December 1989, and KCTA started operations
in April 1990. KCTA was created for the purpose of developing, managing and operating the container



- 31 -
handling facilities in Korea. When KCTA began operations, the rights to operate the Pusan Container
Terminal Operating Company (PCTOC) and the Pusan East Container Terminal (PECT), and the
corresponding long term debt incurred to construct them, were transferred to it by KMPA. As an
authority, KCTA is permitted to retain the profits from renting these port facilities in order to invest in
other container handling facilities such as the Pusan Phase IV Container Terminal and the Phase I
Container Terminal in Kwangyang Bay.
5.10       In order to generate the maximum amount of cash from its operations, KCTA amortizes the
port operating rights that it received from KMPA over a period of five years. Since the value of these
rights represented almost 75% of KCTA's total assets in 1990, the annual amortization also represents
about the same percentage of KCTA's operating expenses which has enabled KCTA to retain almost 90%
of its operating revenue in the form of cash to be invested in future facilities. A brief summary of some
key operating and cash flow data are presented below and set out in more detail in Tables 21-24.

Self Financing Ratio (%)                 n/a    1,928.0       226.0
5.11       In order to meet the forecasted need to handle in excess of 4 million TEUs by the year
1996, KCTA is currently constructing two four berth container terminals. In order to finance the
construction of these facilities, KCTA will borrow a total of about W370 billion between 1993 and when
the construction is complete in 1997, but it will finance in excess of 35% of this capital cost from its
operations. This will place some pressure on KCTA to continue to generate sufficient cash to service its
large portfolio of public and private debt, but since the forecasts project large increases in the volume
of container traffic moving through the terminals, the terminal operating companies should not experience
any difficulty in making the rental payments on the facilities. As the following table summnarizes, KCTA



- 32 -
consistently generates large cash flows from its operations by controlling its working expenses, and by
producing a steady stream of rental income from its container handling facilities:

E. Sensitivity Analysis
5. 12      There was no sensitivity analysis conducted for the operations of KCTA since as a "land
lord" port authority, it is somewhat insulated from the normal risks associated with operating large port
facilities. Each of the leases with the terminal operating companies has minimum throughput
requirements which gives KCTA protection against a decline in volume and provides the opportunity to
participate with the operators in volume increases above the minimum. No sensitivity analysis was done
tfr KMPA even though it is subject to more risk of a reduction in port charges (from a reduction in both
the ntmber of ships and the total tonnage) because the number of variables involved makes any
meaniiigful analysis unlikely.



- 33 -
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.1      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that:
(a)  the Government will cause KMPA and KCTA to have their financial statements and those
of each of the DMPAs audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Such
financial statements and audit reports would also include a separate opinion from the auditor
on disbursements made using Statements of Expenditures (SOE) and on the IBRD Special
Account for the Bank loan. Such statements and audit reports would be submitted to the
Bank within eight (8) months of the end of each fiscal year (para 1.18);
(b)   KMPA will submit a proposal to the Bank identifying the participants and programs for the
extended study portion of the environmental training programs no later than November 1
of the year preceding the training (para 3.3(e)(iii));
(c)   KMPA will submit a proposal to the Bank identifying the participants and program for the
operational and technical training program no later than November I of the year preceding
the training (para 3.3 (e)(iv));
(d)   No disbursements will be made with respect to the Dadaepo component until KMPA
provides the Bank with satisfactory evidence that the EIA for Dadaepo has been approved
by MOE (para 3.22);
(e)   Resettlement of the affected people will be done in accordance with the following principles
and objectives: that the people shall be consulted and participate in the design and
implementation of the resettlement activities, and at least 30 days prior to their
displacement, each affected person shall be provided with a compensation package, in cash
or in kind, sufficient to ensure that each affected person shall improve or at least regain,
the standard of living and means of livelihood that they were enjoying prior to their
displacement. In addition, each compensation package shall include (a) compensation for
the assets lost, or at least, at replacement costs; and (b) adequate subsistance allowance
during the transition period of resettlement (para 3.25);
(t)   KMPA would be required to submit to the Bank the monitoring results/reports on the
Dadaepo component which are required by MOE by March 31 of each year starting in 1996
(para 3.32);
(g)   KCTA would be required to submit to the Bank the monitoring results/reports on the Pusan
Phase IV component as required by MOE by March 31 of each year starting in 1996 (para
3.33); and



- 34 -
(h)   KMPA and KCTA should each generate sufficient cash from operations so that when
combined with the cash and short-term securities on hand at January I of the year the total
represents not less than 20% of the annual average capital expenditures for that year and
the next following for KMPA and 40% for KCTA (para 5.8).
6.2        Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project constitutes a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$100 million equivalent, for a period of 15 years, including a grace period
of five years, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The borrower would be the Republic of
Korea.

KOREA
PORTS DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem Program
Background
1.         Situated between the Korean Peninsula and the Chinese mainland,the Yellow Sea is a
semi-enclosed, shelf-type shallow sea. It is bounded on the north by China's Liaodong Peninsula, adjoins
the Korea Peninsula on the east, borders the East China Sea on the south and the coasts of China's
Shandong and Jiangsu Provinces on the west. It is approximately 380,000 Km2 in area, with shallow
depths averaging 44 meters.
2.         Because of its size and semi-enclosed nature, the Yellow Sea functions as a large marine
ecosystem. The Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem (YSLME) is characterized by unique bathymetry,
hydrography, productivity and tropically linked populations of living marine resources, which distinguish
it from the Bohai Sea to the north, and the East China Sea to the South.
3.         The YSLME is inherently international in nature, bounded by China to the west and South
Korea and North Korea to the East. Water and living marine resources circulate freely within the
international waters of the YSLME, and sometimes beyond. Therefore, environmental problems
generated at any point in the YSLME potentially affect each country. Because the YSLME is a
semi-enclosed continental shelf-type shallow basin, it has reduced water exchange with the open ocean.
Any persistent pollutants introduced to the system therefore have a high residence time.
4.         In recent years, the YSLME has suffered increasingly from anthropogenic perturbations.
Levels of pollution, particularly in the northern areas and throughout the coastal zone, have trended
upward, and significant decreases in the biodiversity of coastal marine communities have been
documented. In addition, biomass yields from living marine resource populations have decreased
precipitously due to overfishing and coastal habitat loss. Both Korean and Chinese fishery scientist have
described significant decreases in yields of important commercial fish stocks such as the yellow croaker,
probably due to overfishing. The coastal zone of the YSLME in particular has been impacted by human
activities, such as offshore oil and gas development, seaport construction and expansion, shipping, water
conservancy projects, land reclamation, mariculture and discharges of pollutants from various sources.
5.         To help address these environmental concerns in the international waters of the YSLME,
the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) have pursued a policy of assisting China and
Korea to develop ship waste collection and disposal facilities in some ports bordering the YSLME. The
Port Development and Environmental Improvement Project will assist Korea in the development of such
ship waste facilities. Anticipated benefits of these facilities include reduction of pollution levels in the
shared waters of the YSLME. However, these facilities only address one aspect of the problem. Also,
a means is required to assess the environmental benefits (or lack thereot) of the port facilities.



- 36 -
ANNEX I
Page 2 of 8
6.         In order to fully address the multiple disturbances now aftfecting the YSLME, a more
comprehensive program for monitoring and mitigation will be established. The program will be synoptic,
monitoring pollution, ecosystem productivity, biodiversity and changes in tisheries production. In
addition, the program will be international, involving both Korea and China, the countries which have
most significant impact on the health of the YSLME and its resources.
Objectives
7.         The overall objective of the program is to monitor sources ot stress on the YSLME,
particularly those from pollution, degradation of coastal habitats, and overtishing, and to provide this
information in a usable form to decision-makers. This information can then he used to determine options
for improved ecosystem management and reduction of anthropogenic stresses on the YSLME. An
essential element of the program will be to ensure appropriate cooperation between Korea and China in
monitoring and assessment.
Specitic objectives for the project are to:
(a)  Implement a comprehensive monitoring and assessment program for the YSLME, led by
the Korea Ocean Research and Development Institute (KORDI);
(b)   Provide appropriate equipment for marine monitoring and assessment, and training for
KORDI staff;
(c)   Establish an international GIS data base for the YSLME containing information on
pollution, living marine resources, biodiversity, major ecological parameters and specific
policies and practices in marine management, both domestically and internationally; and
(d)   Coordinate monitoring and assessment activities between Korean marine scientists and
managers and their counterparts in China.
The YSLME Monitoring Program
8.         The monitoring activity consists of two modules: (a) Ecosystem Productivity and (b) Living
Marine Resources (includes pollution monitoring and analyses). The activities in each operational module
were designed by scientists from Korea and China, and consultants from United States (National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)) and the U.K., who met together during the First and Second
International Workshops on the Collaborative China/Korea Joint Monitoring Program tor the YSLME,
held in Qingdao in May, 1993, and Seoul in November, 1993, respectively. Additional meetings were
conducted with Korean agencies December 1993 and February 1994. Although this is a cooperative
program between Korea and China, the Korea Ports Development and Environmental Improvement
Project will support only those activities occurring in Korea. Chinese support will be provided through
a separate proposal to the Global Environment Facility.



- 37 -
ANNEX I
Page 3 of 8
Ecosystem Productivity Module
9.         This module will monitor primary and secondary productivity in the planktonic community
as well as abiotic environmental factors. Monitoring will be conducted primarily using instrumented
continuous plankton recorders (CPR) and undulating oceanographic recorders (UOR) in a program of
regular transect surveys across the YSLME from Korea to China. CPR and UOR are instruments towed
behind ships-of-opportunity (commercial vessels traversing fixed routes) making quantitative collections
of phytoplankton and zooplankton while measuring physical, chemical and biological variables including
temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, irradiance, chlorophyll, nitrate/nitrite, petrogenic hydrocarbons,
productivity, bioluminescence and turbidity. This suite of measurements, along with the plankton
collections, will allow scientists to determine the seasonal variability and general health and productivity
of the ecosystem, and provide some information on biodiversity and pollution levels.
10.        Additional data on physical and chemical oceanographic parameters will be provided by the
National Fisheries Research and Development Agency's (NFRDA) serial oceanographic cruises. These
have been conducted on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis since 1960 on a series of transects
surrounding the Korean Peninsula. Data include temperature, salinity, oxygen and pH at the surface and
at regular depth intervals. T'hese time series will be of use in assisting interpretations of CPR/UOR data,
as well as general oceanographic conditions in the Korean coastal waters of the YSLME.
11.        CPRIUOR surveys will also be enhanced with synoptic views from satellite remote sensing.
Recent studies of sea surface temperature (from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radar
satellite) and ocean color have established the importance of regularly collected satellite data for large
ecosystem studies, for determining the extent and frequency of harmful algal blooms, and for detecting
spatial changes in productivity related to near-coastal eutrophication.
Living Marine Resource Module
12.        The module will provide information on the status of stocks of living marine resources and
their environment. It consists of fisheries-independent trawl surveys conducted using research vessels,
and processing and analysis of the resulting data. These surveys will:
(a)   Make collections of demersal and pelagic fishes using bottom and mid-water trawls;
(b)   Use hydroacoustic gear to estimate biomass and species composition of fish stocks when
feasible;
(c)   Collect samples of fish tissues, sediments and water for contaminant loading analyses; and
(d)   Collect ichthyoplankton and benthos samples.
13.        Surveys will be conducted simultaneously on a quarterly basis by Korean and Chinese
vesseis on a 30 minute X 30 minute grid across the YSLME. This will comprise a total of 213 stations
divided between both countries. Since some interaction and fish stock exchange exists between the
YSLME and the East China Sea LME, particularly for important commercial species, the area of survey
coverage will extend to 31 ON. Korean scientists will conduct pilot systematic sampling during the first
year to establish more accurately the survey area, with stratified sampling conducted subsequently.



- 38 -
ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 8
Surveys will be conducted with KORDI's R/V Onnuri, or with similarly equipped vessels from the
Korean research fleet. Each quarterly survey will take approximately three weeks. Initially, surveys will
be conducted in December, late March-early April, June, and October, in consideration of observed fish
migratory patterns.
14.        Collection of samples for pollution monitoring will occur during living marine resource
surveys. In addition, petrogenic hydrocarbon levels will be monitored during the CPR/UOR surveys.
Samples will be collected on a 2 degree x 2 degree grid during the course of the fish surveys, with more
spatially intensive sampling near the mouth of the Yangtze River, and in the northern YSLME. Specific
compounds of interest include pesticides, organophosphates, aromatic hydrocarbons, nutrients, methyl
mercury and heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Co, Zn, Hg).
Sample Processing and Data Analysis
15.        KORDI's Division of Biological Oceanography will provide the processing and analysis of
plankton samples from the CPR/UOR surveys, as well as remotely-sensed temperature and ocean color
data. Additional technician-level assistants will be required for plankton sorting and analysis, as well as
for logistical operations, and maintenance of both electronics and the actual plankton recorder
mechanisms.
16.        The Division of Biological Oceanography is well equipped, with sufficient microscopes and
computer equipment to support analysis activities. Some specialized equipment, such as specialized
microscope stages for examination of CPR/UOR samples, will be provided.
17.        For living marine resource surveys, KORDI is fully equipped and will conduct basic catch
sorting, morphometric measurements, identification of species, analysis of tish samples for gross
pathology, and analysis of stomach contents. NFRDA and KORDI will cooperate on age and growth
analyses, and on fisheries stock assessment and hydroacoustic survey analysis.
18.        KORDI's Chemical Oceanography Laboratory is fully equipped and prepared to analyze fish
tissue, water and sediment samples for pollutants.  Equipment includes both atomic absorption
spectrophotometers and gas chromatographs with appropriate detectors.
Data Syntheses and Dissemination of Results
19.        At the completion of each full year of monitoring (July '95, '96, '97) and upon completion
of data processing and analysis, a workshop will be held to integrate results from an ecosystem
perspective, and produce assessments of YSLME health. Five indices of ecosystem health will be
evaluated quantitatively for the YSLME: diversity, yield, stability, resilience and productivity.
20.        On the hasis of these results, detailed reports will be prepared describing the status and
health of the YSLME, and recommending specific options for mitigation of problem areas. These reports
will be prepared in formats that are compatible with examining options for management decisions for
mitigating problems with coastal habitat degradation, pollution and water quality, and depleted living
marine resource populations. The reports will be provided to the Ministry of the Environment and the
Ministry of Science and Technology for use in developing management plans for the YSLME. These
reports will also contain annual pro-ram progress reports to MOST and the World Bank.



- 39 -
ANNEX I
Page 5 of 8
21.        Assessment results will also be integrated between Korea and China. According to the GEF
work plan, Chinese scientists will conduct identical annual assessments for their survey data. Upon
completion of the separate Korean and Chinese assessments (August 1995, 1996, 1997), annual joint
workshops will be held to integrate the results across the YSLME survey area and to produce a joint
report on the status of the YSLME which will be distributed to appropriate environmental management
and regulatory agencies in both countries. These annual workshops will also be used to calibrate between
Korean and Chinese scientists conducting the same monitoring and assessment activities.
Institutional Arrangements
22.        KORDI will be the lead agency for the Korean portion of the program. Terms of reference
for KORDI's participation have been prepared. The National Fisheries Research and Development
Agency (NFRDA), the National Fisheries University of Pusan and Kunsan National University will also
participate.
23.        KORDI is a diverse institution which can carry out a broad scope of work. Divisions within
KORDI include Physical Oceanography, Chemical Oceanography, Biological Oceanography, Marine
Geology and Geophysics, with a laboratory for Marine Environmental Engineering, a Polar Research
Center and a Department for Ocean Data and Computer Services. Researchers within these areas have
a very broad range of interests and capabilities which will contribute effectively to the multidisciplinary
monitoring program.
24.        KORDI's near-term strategic plans also include strengthening marine environmental research
capabilities to cope with increasing pollution in the marine environment from industrial sources. KORDI
will participate in Korea's Marine Environmental Management System, which is being established
together with other marine and environmental institutions. This group will implement a National Project
on Marine Environmental Preservation to monitor marine water quality, and assess ecological impacts
of marine pollution. The YSLME monitoring program will contribute valuable information to the
network.
25.        KORDI also has a strong capability in fisheries stock assessment.  Researchers in the
Applied Ecology Laboratory have conducted stock assessments for fish both in the YSLME and other
areas of the Pacific and are familiar with current assessment techniques. Recently, KORDI researchers
have developed comprehensive PC-compatible software for stock assessment, which includes multiple
models for stock parameter estimation, stock size analysis and management parameter estimation.
26.        In China, the State Oceanographic Administration (SOA) will be the lead agency and
KORDI's counterpart for this program. SOA will be assisted by the Yellow Sea Fisheries Institute,
Academia Sinica and other institutions engaged in oceanographic research, marine pollution monitoring,
and living marine resource assessment and development.

Training
27.         Given the well developed technical capacities of KORDI and other participating Korean
technical agencies, relatively little training is required to prepare for monitoring and assessment activities.
Training programs will be required in the following areas:
(a)   Use of CPR/UOR (mechanical and logistical);
(h)   CPR/UOR sensor electronics; and
(c)   Hydroacoustic techniques.
28.         As part of ongoing training and capacity building activities, six scientists and technicians
participating in the program will be provided support to attend one international scientific meeting
annually focused on LMEs, marine science, fisheries, marine pollution, or ecosystem management. The
participants will present papers at these conferences on the results of the YSLME monitoring program.
Candidacy tor participation will he rotated among participating institutions depending on meeting topics
and areas otf specialization.
GIS Database/Data Management
29.         An important element of this program, considering the amount of data being produced, the
number of users of these data, and the necessity to create diverse data sets for ecological analysis, is data
management. A data management system will be designed to ensure a smooth and consistent flow of data
between source, user and repository. Elements of the system will include:
(a)   Establishing consistent data collection and recording methods;
(h)   Transferring data effectively from the field or laboratory to an appropriate database at
KORDI and/or other institutions; and
(c)   Harmonization of data management techniques between KORDI and other participating
institutions both within Korea and in China.
Program Coordination
30.         Successful implementation of this program will require cooperative efforts across the
disciplines, institutions and countries involved. Appropriate organization and coordination are essential
for integrating various efforts to serve the overall objective of the program. Therefore, mechanisms for
organization and coordination of the implementation will be developed at both national and international
levels. KORDI will serve as lead Korean institution and focal point for the YSLME program. In this
capacity, KORDI will also serve as focal point for the Bank and its consultants, and will be responsible
for implementing the project work plan in a timely manner, and preparing annual reports and other
updates as may be required.

31.        Coordination between Korea and China will be achieved through an International
Coordination Group (ICG) and an International Scientific Steering Group (ISSG). These groups will
coordinate administrative and scientific matters to maximize harmonization between the Korean and
Chinese monitoring and assessment programs.
32.        The International Coordination Group is to be composed of National Coordinators designated
by the participating countries, the representatives from participating international funding agencies (World
Bank, UNEP, UNDP, etc.), and the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the International Scientific Steering
Group (see below). Secretariat services will be provided by SOA or KORDI. The proposed terms of

SHIP WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES
Terms of Reference
Introduction
1.         In recent years, deliberate, negligent or accidental release of oil, oily wastes, noxious liquid
substances etc. from ships resulting from marine traffic congestion and the expansion of world tonnage
has constituted a serious source of marine pollution. The International Convention for the Prevention of
Pollution From Ships, 1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (MARPOL 73/78), was promoted by
the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to prohibit all ships from discharging wastes into the sea
which could result in pollution of the marine environment. These wastes include oils, garbage, noxious
substances and sewage. MARPOL 73/78 applies to all ships including oil tankers, cruise ships, general
cargo and container vessels, tugs, ferries, yachts and small pleasure craft.
2.         MARPOL 73/78 has currently five annexes covering discharges from ships:
Annex I:   oily wastes such as ballast water and slop from oil tankers; oily bilge water
from engine room and other spaces; fuel residues; and, waste oil.
*    Annex II:  noxious liquid substances in bulk--tank residues after discharge of cargo.
3    Aniiex III:  harmful substances carried in packaged form, in freight containers, portable
tanks.
3    Annex IV:  sewage (this annex is not yet in force because of limited worldwide sewage
port reception facilities at present).
*    Annex V:  garbage--including food wastes, plastics; oily rags; packing materials; and
dunnage.
3.         MARPOL 73/78 requires that ships retain all the wastes on board and deliver it to shore
reception tacilities at the first port of call unless they meet the specified criteria which enable them to
discharge the waste at sea. The Convention also stipulate various requirements for ship construction and
equipment criteria to minimize discharge of marine pollutants from ships and requires the Government
of each Party to undertake the provision of reception facilities according to the needs of ships using its
ports, terminals or repair facilities. The Convention requires such reception facilities to be able to receive
and treat residues and mixtures containing oil and noxious liquid substances without causing undue delay
to the ships wishing to use such facilities.
4.         As a result of Korea's ratification of the MARPOL Convention, Korean Law no. 4365 was
passed. The law requires every Korean port authority to arrange for the provision, operation and
maintenance of adequate facilities, the collection, treatment and disposal of wastes generated by vessels

calling at Korea's ports. This study will, inter alia, form the basis for the development of ship waste
disposal facilities (SWDF) in Korea.
5.          Attached is a background paper to assist the consultants in their study and deliberation and
to provide an indication of the coverage expected in the assignment.
Objectives of the Study
6.          The study will formulate and evaluate investment options, policies and strategies relating
to the collection, storage, treatment and disposal of ship wastes. The study will also develop detailed
engineering design of the main elements of the collection, storage, treatment, disposal and the associated
site facilities for the recommended locations. In particular, the study will provide recommendations on:
(a)   how the wastes from vessels calling at Korea's ports are to be collected, stored, treated and
disposed of;
(h)   the type and extent of facilities that have to be provided to receive and treat the wastes and
their locations;
(c)   how the proposed facilities can be integrated with the existing private or public facilities to
minimize overlap and to provide economy of scale;
(d)   the design and estimate of costs with respect to new facilities that have to be constructed as
well as the specific improvements, additions or modifications that have to be made to the
existing facilities;
(e)   the method of recovery of the cost of investments, operation and maintenance of the
facilities including the role of the private sector in providing this service;
(t)   institutional and organizational options for successful implementation of the reception
facilities with particular reference to the role of KMPA, the Coastguard and the MOE; and
(g)   the adequacy of current laws and regulations, and the ways and means by which legal and
statuary requirements regulating the discharge of wastes in ports can be met and enforced.
Scope of Work
7.          The study will:
(a)   identify and list the existing facilities including their ownership, location, MOE and local
certification status, capability etc. for the reception, treatment and disposal of ship wastes;
(h)   estimate the present and forecast the future volume of ship wastes that will be generated by
type tfr each of the 27 ports for the period 1994-2003 by using a stratified sample survey;
(c)   explore the opportunities for recycling and for alterative use of the waste;
(d)   based on the above and taking into consideration other relevant factors, identify  what
additional facilities are required including the secondary ports which can be utilized as

"hub" systems to collect wastes from coastal vessels. Determine where these facilities are
to be located and propose a prioritized implementation program;
(e)   provide designs and cost estimates for new construction including the "hub" facilities and
for improvements and modifications to the existing facilities;
(t)  identify institutional and/or other barriers which presently or potentially could inhibit the
implementation of MARPOL 73/78 requirements. (Possible examples of such barriers would
include insufficient incentives and/or lack of deterrents for ships to discharge their wastes
legitimately, prohibitive investment costs of new facilities, inadequate legislation and
mechanism for enforcement, lack of private sector incentives etc.);
(g)   review the adequacy of current laws and regulations and recommend changes; and
(h)   propose institutional and organizational options for successful implementation and operation
of the proposed facilities and in particular the role of private sector and the government with
regard to ownership, control, incentives, day-to-day operation, monitoring, enforcement,
cost recovery, etc.

Background Paper
Categories of Ship Wastes
I1.        There are four basic categories of ship generated wastes: oily wastes; garbage; sewage and
noxious liquid substances (chemicals).
2.          Oily Wastes: All propelled ships, irrespective of size or type, generate oily wastes - usually
some oil mixed with much larger quantities of sea water. A ship may generate four types of oily wastes.
These are: (i) oily bilge wastes; (ii) dirty ballast water; (iii) tank washings; and (iv) oily residues and
liquid and solid sludge.
(a)   Oily bilge wastes: Bilge water accumulation at sea varies widely and depends on the age
of the ship, the type of machinery and the standard of maintenance and housekeeping on the
ship. Oil and grease in the bilge originate from leaks and spills in the engine room and from
machinery and auxiliary equipment in other parts of the ship. Generally, older vessels and
poorly maintained vessels generate more oily wastes. Also, when routine maintenance or
emergency repairs are carried out on engines and machinery, oils are often changed and the
used oil must be disposed of. Thus, the bilge may contain a mixture of oils and water and
other spilled substances. Traditionally, the bilge room is kept as dry as possible and
automatic pumps operate continuously discharging the contents directly into the sea. Often,
however, oils are separated and retained on board.
A typical ship may generate about 4.5 tones of bilge oil per year. Other sources quote bilge
waste generation rates ranging from I to 15 tones per day for ocean tonnage and from 0.1
to 3 tones per day for coastal tonnage for well-run vessels. A ship in port will generate
substantially less bilge water than when the machinery is under power at sea.
(h)   Dirty ballast water: All oil tankers when not carrying cargo travel with their tanks partly
full of sea water to "ballast" the ships and make it stable. When a crude carrier arrives at
a loading port, it must first discharge its ballast water. Typically this is done at sea just
before entering the port or at the terminal if the terminal can accept ballast water. Older
generations of tankers use their cargo tanks to hold the ballast water. Thus dirty ballast
water may consist of a large volume of sea water, normally about 10%-30% of the dwt of
the vessel (i.e. a 100,000 dwt tanker may discharge about 10,000-30,000 tones of dirty
ballast) mixed with small quantities of oil. The amount of oil and cargo residue entrained
with the ballast towards the end of the discharge from the ballast tanks may amount to
between 0.4 and I per cent of the volume of the dirty ballast in any tank. Modern tankers
have "segregated" ballast tanks used only for ballast water and therefore do not require on-
shore ballast receiving facilities except under abnormal voyage conditions.
(c)   Tank washings:  Even the new generations of petroleum products carriers with their
segregated ballast tanks need to clean their tanks when changing from one type of cargo to
another and the port/terminal must be able to receive these tank washings called the "slops".
The wash water quantity will be small in comparison with the quantity of dirty ballast and



- 47  -                                ANNEX 2
Page 5 of 11
may be in the order of 5 percent of dwt. The amount of cargo residues floating in the slop
tank may be of the order of 0.2 percent of the total cargo capacity of the ship. A tanker
may discharge a cargo at a terminal and be required to load a cargo of different product at
the same terminal. In such a case, reception facility is required to accept the tank washings
as the tanker cleans its tanks. There are also techniques, such as "retention-on-board" (or
"load-on-top"), which enable tankers to avoid discharging oily ballast water ashore.
(d)   Oily residues and liquid and solid sludge: Another major source of marine pollution
comes from the discharge of fuel and lubeoil residues which is collected in fuel separators
and at the bottom of the fuel tanks which can amount to 1 % of the fuel oil consumed. This
material is almost solid and although some of it may sink at the bottom of the sea, other
may find its way to shore and result in the familiar 'tar balls' found on beaches. A ship can
generate about 0.25 tones of residue per day depending on the fuel quality and consumption.
3.         For the most part, modern ships will carry separate ballast tanks, and if they do not, national
authorities could require ship owners to modify their ships and install segregated ballast tanks. At an
installation cost of around US$100,000 per ship, the feasibility of this alternative is not unrealistic. It has
been estimated that in 1992 in Korea, 46,000 tons per annum of oily waste and sludge, originating largely
from the operations of small to medium sized coastal and fishing vessels required attention. Of the 46,000
tons, approximately 16,000 tons were received for treatment by private ship waste disposal facilities
(SWDF) in Korean ports (Ulsan, Inchon, Pohang, and Yeosu). (In addition, approximately 5,000 tons
were received in Pusan for transport by tanker trucks to treatment at an unauthorized waste treatment
facility in Yangsan). The remaining 25,000 tons of the dirty oily waste is not readily accounted for.
Given the rapidly increasing environmental consciousness and interest among Korean for a clean coastline
for productive and leisure activities, it is in the public interest to implement a system to secure this fragile
natural resource from oil spills and routine discharges of destructive oily substances, as well as the
disposal of other ship waste including sewage, garbage, chemicals and hazardous wastes.
4.         In order to determine mnore accurately the amounts of oily waste that may require some form
of treatment the Korean Maritime Training and Research Institute (KMTRI) has completed a careful
technical survey of oil consumption for different on-board activities, and estimated the waste generation,
for a sample of 120 vessels. By using regression analysis the relationship between ship characteristics and
oily waste generation can be established and used in determining the future SWDF capacities.
5.         It is the small coastal vessels lacking on-board facilities for environmental treatment of ship
N.aste, which presently cause the most harm. In 1991, a total of some 222,000 coastal vessels (many of
which were fishing vessels) made port calls in the 25 major Korean ports. Inchon, with 38,063 port calls
received the highest number of coastal vessels, followed by Mokpo with 24,258 and Cheju with 23,995.
In addition, five more ports Pusan, Ulsan, Kwangyang, Kunsan, and Chungmu, handled from 13,000 to
19,000 coastal vessels per year. The remaining ports handled substantially less coastal traffic. The eight
ports noted above, located around Korea, handled more than 70% of total coastal ship traffic in 1991.
As a result, it is expected that the initial focus of development would be on these eight ports, which
would be designated as possible "hubs" for ship waste treatment and disposal. Private ship waste
treatmtnt facilities are presently found in Cheju, Tonghae, Mokpo and Kunsan, in addition to the tank
cleaning facility in Ulsan. Storage tanks are found in eight other ports: Taesan, Pyongtaek, Kojong,
Wando, Kvrangyang, Yosu, Masan, and Sokcho. The private companies are facing serious financial
problems due to low volume of wastes and the resulting low income. The low volume may be due to
more ships being equipped with on board facilities or due to illegal disposal.



- 48  -                                 ANNEX 2
Page 6 of 11
6.          The proposed development of the SWDF will need to take into account how changes over
time in the ships' own facilities for waste storage and treatment will affect the demand for the SWDF
services. The expected increase in on-board equipment for storing and processing ship waste must be
incorporated into the analysis along with the forecasts for the growth and composition of ship traffic.
The expectation of low volumes can become a major factor in discouraging potential investors to develop
SWDF.
7.          The quality and recyclability of the sludge and oily waste, also need to be established. Since
oily waste and sludge appear in a 5:1 ratio no collector of oily wastes is interested in collecting sludge.
The sludge is messy with high asphaltic and solid contents. However, to the extent that there is a market
for recycled products from oily wastes, the collection of sludge can be made a compulsory pre-requisite
to the free collection of oily waste. The analysis should therefore establish whether such an oily
waste/sludge product could be sold at below coal price level and remain attractive for contractors. At
present it appears that oily waste is used to generate heat/power to operate treatment facilities, reducing
the ultimate cost of waste treatment operations.Most modern container and other large oceangoing vessels
have on-board facilities to burn the oily sludge. The heat and steam which is generated can be used
economically on the vessel.
8.          When tankers change cargo the tanks must be cleaned.  Whereas such tank cleaning
operations formed the basis of profitable private tank cleaning facilities for ULCCs and VLCCs in Korean
ports such as Pusan and Ulsan in the 1970s and early 1980s, such services have since shifted away from
Korea to neighboring countries where costs are lower. As a result, the tank cleaning and oily ship waste
treatment facilities in Pusan were shut down and eventually dismantled in 1992. The facility in Ulsan
on the other hand was able to adjust to changing market conditions and take on a sufficient volume of
tank cleaning tasks for land-based stationary tanks when the ship cleaning activity in Korea declined.
9.          Experience with vessel sludge and oily waste in places like Norway and India indicate that
waste oil can be recycled to fuel oil or even diesel, and sold as a substitute for coal, diesel or heavy fuel
oil to land based energy intensive small-scale industry. Any analysis conducted to determine the situation
in Korea should examine the prospective size and growth (if any) of a market of this type. In order to
do this, the analysis should establish:
(a)   Whether a substitute fuel market exists in Korea, for example in land-based energy-intensive
small scale industry, or in the operation of waste treatment plants;
(h)   What amounts of oily waste and sludge are economically recyclable, and what amounts must
he deposited for incineration;
(c)   What would be the actual fob-price (border price) of such recycled fuel in terms of the
substitute it may replace;
(d)   What are the all-inclusive unit costs of collecting, transporting and processing oily waste
to derive a marketable substitute waste oil fuel, or to burn it tor heat generation;
(e)   What annual volumes, and what future growth is anticipated tor this potential revenue
generating-or cost saving- marKet;



- 49  -                                 ANNEX 2
Page 7 of 11
(t)   Will the revenues from such a processing facility suffice to amortize the capital, cover
operating and maintenance cost, and yield an acceptable rate of return on invested capital;
and
(g)   Should the processing facility pay for or receive for free, the sludge and oily waste to be
recycled as an incentive to ships to use the facilities, or should the ships pay to deliver their
oily waste and be monitored and audited carefully by a port personnel.
10.         Garbage: All vessels of all types and size generate garbage. It originates from:
(a)  the crew and passengers and consists of waste foodstuffs, containers, packaging and
wrappings, bottles and glass, and other typical domestic wastes;
(b)   ship maintenance and consist of rags and cleaning materials, oily rags, chemical agents,
paint and removers, scrapings, workshop refuse, rope and cloths, exchanged components,
and many other materials;
(c)  the cargo in the hold and consists of packaging and wrapping materials, dunnage, tarpaulins,
lashings of wire, rope and banding, and occasionally the cargo itself as a consequence of
being washed overboard in heavy weather; and
(d)   fishing and fishing gear wastes and losses.
I 1.       All these materials are normally thrown over the side of the vessel except when in port or
other areas where such practice is prohibited by local authorities. It is estimated that a general cargo
vessel with 35 crew over a voyage of 15 days will generate 1,050 Kg (2,310 lbs.) of domestic garbage
with a volume of 4.53 cubic meters (160 cubic feet). Cruise, ferry and passenger ships generate huge
volumes of garbage. The cruise ship "Sovereign of the Seas" is estimated to generate 6,800 Kg (15,000
lbs.) or 44.2 cubic meters (1,560 cubic feet) of garbage per day. The more modern vessels are
equipped with compactors and some with incinerators. Under MARPOL the residues from the incinerator
is considered to be of the same category as plastics and must be retained on board. Almost no cruise ships
have the capacity to store and carry large quantities of garbage.
12.         Sewage: All vessels of all types and size generate sewage. Traditionally, sewage is
comminuted and discharged directly to the sea, except when import or other restrictions prohibit such
practices. Almost all vessels are equipped with holding tanks with sufficient capacity to enable the vessel
to retain its sewage aboard while in port. After sailing, and as soon as the vessel reaches open water,
the holding tank is discharged into the sea. Cruise, ferry and large passenger vessels generate very large
volumes and the more modern vessels are equipped with treatment plants producing satisfactory
chlorinated effluents. Very few ships are currently equipped with pumps to pump their sewage ashore but
when MARPOL 73/78 Annex IV becomes effective all new ships must be fitted with pumps to be able
to transfer their sewage ashore. Because of many national regulations concerning small craft and yachts,
these vessels are normally equipped with holding tanks and pump ashore systems. Although MARPOL
73/78 Annex IV, Sewage, is not yet in force because of the scarcity of shore reception facilities world-
wide, this situation is expected to change fairly rapidly.
13.        Cbemicalst A wide range sf chemicals are transported in bulk in specially designed
chemical tankers. Some of these chemicals are regarded as noxious liquid substances and pose a danger
i the marine enviromment if released into the sea. These vessels may need to clean their tanks before



- 50  -                                 ANNEX 2
Page 8 of 11
shipping a new and different cargo and this has also been traditionally carried out at sea with the
washings discharged into the sea. MARPOL 73/78 prohibits such discharges. A more likely problem that
frequently occurs is where noxious liquid substances are being carried in tank containers, drums or other
portable tanks and these are ruptured or a spill occurs during the voyage. The chemicals have to be
cleaned up, stored and then discharged in the first port of call together with the used cleaning materials.
The Reception Facilities
14.        Many large ports in developing countries have been receiving some garbage and some waste
oils from vessels for many years. Generally, the volumes have been small and the ports have had little
difficulty in disposing of the waste, although often, the manner of disposal has been less than satisfactory.
The impact of MARPOL 73/78 is that countries will now have to provide adequate reception facilities
in all of their ports, harbors and anchorages. The implementation will take both time and investment and
a program will have to be established in terms of priority with the more important ports being equipped
first. The following provides an indication of the facilities to be provided for satisfactory handling of ship
generated wastes.
15.        Oily Wastes. Receiving oily wastes from vessels requires a facility that can remove the
water from the received waste and then dispose of the resulting oils. Where there is an adjacent oil
refinery or oil recycling plant this is usually not a problem but where no such facilities exist disposing
of oil can he very difficult. The port reception facility consists of holding tanks for oily water equipped
with a skimmer, a separator that produces an effluent of an acceptable water quality, and a holding tank
for the concentrated oil, plus a mobile road tanker (or self propelled barge) to transfer the oily wastes
from the ship to the tank and from the concentrate tank to the refinery. Typically, for a small 8/10 berth
port, the holding tank needs to be 200 cubic meters capacity, the separator capable of 10 cubic
meters/hour and the concentrate tank 10 cubic meters with a total investment cost of about US$800,000.
If there is no refinery the waste oil can sometimes be blended with heavy bunker fuel oil for shore or
marine use.
16.        Some ports may be able to contract the reception of oily wastes to a commercial oil-
recycling company if there is one available. There are instances,even in the developing countries, where
such a contract is a "free service" because of the volume and value of the oils received.
17.        Before oil tankers can be loaded, they may need to discharge ballast water and/or slops.
Ballast water facilities are expensive because of the huge volumes involved. Even so, they have often
been in operation for a number of years even in lesser developed country oil terminals. With the steady
growth of modern tankers with segregated ballast tanks the problem is not considered to be acute.
Disposing of the resulting oils is not a problem for oil terminals since it is usually blended into bunker
tuel or crude oils.
18.        Oily sludge and fuel residues can be stored without treatment in a lined dedicated basin or
incinerated. Refineries usually have dedicated sludge basins and may accept additional sludge from ports.
This material has been extensively used in road construction in industrialized countries.
19.        Garbage: Garbage is simpler to manage. The normal practice is to collect the garbage on
each berth and to haul it to the adjacent city or municipal waste landfill site. For a small 8/10 berth port
the investment in dumpsters and a single truck is expected to be about US$260,000. In many countries
it is currently illegal to receive garbage and sewage from ships because of health and agricultural risks
_id this issue has to be resolved satisfactorily with he legislative and regulatory authorities. Some

Page 9 of 11
countries may insist on simple fumigation process before the garbage can leave the port area. A serious
problem exists in ports where the adjacent municipality has no proper solid waste disposal system, a very
common situation. The port may be faced with having to install and operate an incinerator itself. Such
a solution may be very expensive and is not considered to be an ideal solution. Recycling should be the
ultimate goal, with private contractors given the responsibility to collect on-board waste at no charge, and
allowed to sell recycled materials. Where such a setup is not feasible, the ship should be obliged to pay
for or deliver waste to a designated reception facility. For example, in Pusan from 1995 a large central
waste treatment facility, jointly financed and owned by the public and private sector and operated as an
autonomous company, will serve all industry and ships.
20.        Sewage: Sewage can be collected from the ship with a mobile vacuum tanker (or barge)
and, where permissible, discharged into the municipal system, if there is one. The port may be faced
with the installation of a sewage treatment plant if local authorities will not permit discharge into the
municipal system or if there is no system available.
21.        Chemicals: Most developing countries are not trading in chemicals in bulk so the receipt
of chemicals is not a major problem. However, there will be occasions when a dry cargo ship wishes to
discharge spilled chemicals and the port will have to receive and dispose of them in an environmentally
safe manner. This problem is associated with the overall problem of developing country ports to handle
hazardous cargoes when there is typically insufficient training of cargo handlers and supervisors in how
to recognize, respect, handle, store and deal with this type of cargo and spills.
22.        There are three major issues: The ultimate fate of the wastes received; how to recover the
cost of investment and operation of the reception facilities; and how to monitor and enforce MARPOL
73/78.
The Ultimate Fate of the Wastes
23.        This is the major issue. There is little point in collecting wastes from vessels if the land
based system is to discharge waste to sea. The provision of port reception facilities is only the start of
the task. Disposing of oily waste and plastics presents the most difficult problem but sewage can also
create major problems in sersitive marine environments even when properly treated because of the high
nutrient content.
24.        Special hazardous wastes such as chemicals, nondegradable plastics and noxious waste
resulting form ship operations and maintenance, requires specialized and costly treatment. The recent
developments in Pusan is suggestive of future trends in this area. In this case city authorities and the
private sector (represented by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry) have formed a joint and
autonomous waste disposal and treatment facility corporation.  The city and some 200 private
corporations are involved as shareholders. The resultant entity established for the purpose is responsible
for irnplementing the project, which is to be operational from April 1995, and which is scheduled to
receive all industrial and ship waste (including oily waste and sewage) and use it to generate steam that
will provide heat for use in the facility. In return, economies of scale and continuous operation of the
incinerators will enable dhe introduction of more reasonable charges to be levied on ship owners for
receiving their waste, than is the case at present.

Page 10 of 11
Cost Recovery
25.        The capital cost of the reception facilities, the training of staff and the day to day
management and operation of the facilities should be recovered from the vessels using the port, harbor
or anchorages. To make the system effective and reduce the risk of the ship discharging wastes at sea
under cover of night or heavy weather, the waste reception facilities should be perceived by the ship
operators to be a free service. Any system that charges the vessel by the cubic meter or other unit
measure will deter the ship operator form bringing his entire compliment of wastes to the first port of
call to save costs. There is much evidence of this practice in the US coastal waters where, in some cases,
vessels are charged for waste based on volume or weight basis.
26.        The recommended approach is to add the costs of providing and maintaining reception
facilities to the general charges made to all vessels using the port. Many ports have a general item in their
tariff and port charges usually based on grt/nrt, the length of stay, and the type of vessel (eg Cruise ship,
Bulk carrier, Yacht, etc.) to which the cost of providing waste receiving services can be added. The
charge is applied whether the vessel uses the facilities or not. Typically, the amortization and operating
costs of basic port reception facilities will amount to about US$0. 10 per ton of cargo or about US$500
per ship To this figure, additional cost to cover the cost of disposing of the wastes will need to be added.
For example, municipal landfills may charge as much as US$40.00 per ton for accepting garbage. Where
shore wastes are incinerated, the costs may reach US$50.00 to 60.00 per ton. These costs will vary
widely depending on local circumstances and practices. In some instances ports are able to recover their
costs tor receiving waste oils where they can sell the waste to a local oil recycling plant.
27.        To attain the desired results the options should focus on enabling the providers of the
services to profit from the activity. Failing that, decision makers would need to review options which
would satisfy the law and the environmental regulations at the lowest cost possible.
28.        In the case of the SWDFs the "polluters pay" principle should apply. For this reason efforts
need to be made to enable the facilities to break even or operate at a margin that can service the capital
invested. Consumers will undoubtedly end up paying for the improved environment in the form of higher
comm(xlity prices or higher taxes. However, with increasing income, higher levels of education and
living standards, willingness to pay for cleaner marine environment could be quite high. Such was the
case in the North Sea Plan in Norway.
Monitoring/Enforcement
29.        It will be difficult to enforce the MARPOL Convention and the more unscrupulous ship
operators will tend to ignore it in order to reduce the cost of training crew, providing storage and
instituting essential discipline. The US coast guard have proposed a system tor the US legislation which
has merit. On arrival in a US port, the port responsible agency (USCG, Marine Police, DEA, harbor
master, etc) will request the ship to demonstrate the volumes of wastes that they have on board and wish
to discharge. If the volumes are substantially smaller than anticipated such that the ship must have
discharged part of it at sea (considering the length of voyage; number of crew; type, age and condition
of the vessel; etc) a heavy fine is imposed and the vessel held at port until the fine is paid.
30.        Effective implementation may require that the Port Authority ensure SWDF contractors
abide by their agreements and visit every vessel assigned to collect the regular garbage. This could be
facilitated by means af the ship agents in the port, who could be given the responsibility for controlling
and reporting the volume of garbage collect (garbage collection auditing).



- 53  -                                ANNEX 2
Page 11 of 11
31.        What are the incentives and commands/controls required to induce the arriving vessels
without on-board waste treatment facilities to submit their oily waste and sludge to the SWDF? First,
the vessels that have invested in equipment for internalizing disposal by burning waste on board should
not be torced to submit their waste to the SWDF, or to pay additional port charges for services that they
do not need. To facilitate identification of such vessels their registration upon arrival should identify them
by their waste treatment capabilities.
32.        For economically recyclable oily waste, the port or an authorized SWDF, could stimulate
orderly discharge to an SWDF by offering to buy it, or take it for free, and pump it out of the vessel
while it is being unloaded and/or loaded. This is necessary in order to avoid delays and increased
handling time at quay-side of already highly congested ports. To organize for such an operation the
SWDF would need specialized port tankers to operate shipside with internationally standardized pumping
gear. These tankers would bring the oily waste/sludge to the treatment facility in the port operated by the
SWDF, or to a temporary storage tank, before transporting it to a "hub" treatment facility. The price
paid for the oily waste, or the charge for taking it for treatment (if any) would have to be set so as to
make this waste collection routine attractive to the ship owner, the SWDF as well as the private
contractors receiving such waste. The institutional and financial role of the government in this context
would need to be established.
33.        For economically non-recyclable oily waste/sludge from  vessels lacking on-board
burning/incineration facilities, a combination of command and controls plus financial incentives should
be considered. In order to capture the non recyclable oily waste/sludge from these vessels, an information
system for arriving vessels, that identifies them by their on-board ability to recycle and burn such waste,
and the amounts of such waste they carry to port, should be implemented. For those that do not have
the self-treatment capability, one option would be to impose a surtax/extra port charge (by way of
deposit), with the bulk repaid to the ship owner (via his port agent) once the oily waste/sludge has been
discharged as prescribed to the SWDF.
34.        For operational reasons, it may be more practical and cost-effective to charge all vessels
with a waste handling tariff (calculated as a function of the estimated waste generated and accumulated
on board for the trip in question, e.g. based on IMO-guidelines, or the formulae derived statistically in
the survey analysis undertaken by KMTRI). Once the discharge is completed and confirmed the ship
owner could be refunded with the amount in excess of the operating and capital expenditures of the
SWDI-. The amount paid (and returned) must be sufficiently large to encourage ship owners to use the
SWDF. On the other hand, if there is proper enforcement, the deposit need not be large. To further
encourage the use of the SWDF, the receipt of an official manifest indicating that the waste has been
satisfactorily removed for storage and subsequent treatment (as is presently practiced by the authorized
treatment facility in Ulsan), could be made a pre-condition for departure, where delays caused by non-
performance would result not only in lost revenue/days at sea, but also additional and heavy port penalty
charges.
35.        If it is found that such a deposit is practical, it would seem rational to manage these
payments through the ships agents in the port. In one way or another, the cost of constructing a SWDF,
and the operation and maintenance costs will eventually be borne by the public. If the costs are passed
on to the vessels in the form of additional port charges, freight rates will undoubtedly increase. If the
costs are paid by the Korean Port Authorities while the vessels are allowed to discharge the waste to the
SWDF at no cost, the Korean consumer will pay in the form of higher taxes. In return for these
payments the Korean public will receive a less polluted marine environment, reduced risks of health
damage, as well as reduced losses in seafood, fisheries and tourism revenues. In the case of recycling,
the country may experience the development of a small but cost-effective energy substitute market that
could reduce energy imports.

KOREA
PORTS DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Environmental Training Program for KMPA
A.    Background
1.         Experience has shown that unless adequate preventive and conservation measures are in
place, ports/harbors and similar maritime developments may be faced with serious environmental
problems of local or regional nature. These problems may include accelerated erosion or accretion;
discharge of industrial wastes and runoffs from factories and plants; loss of animal, plant or marine
species or natural habitats; contamination of fisheries from uncontrolled runoff or waste disposal;
pollution from ship spills or discharges; disposal of polluted dredged materials; health and safety hazards;
salt water intrusions etc.  Past experience has demonstrated the need for early attention to sound
management of port and harbor development projects and systematic attention to their operation to
minimize their impacts on the environment.
2.         The Korea Maritime and Port Administration (KMPA) is the public sector agency
responsible for the planning, construction and operation of Korea's 48 commercial and coastal ports.
Traditionally, KMPA has focused primarily on development planning, engineering and operational issues,
but with the recent emphasis on maintaining Korea's environment, KMPA must begin to develop a better
understanding of the environmental issues confronting the port sector and improve its capability to
manage and minimize the negative environmental impacts due to ports development and operation.
3.         The majority of KMPA's management and technical staff have limited knowledge of the
environmental issues affecting the maritime sector. In order to begin addressing the environmental issues
confronting the port and shipping sectors, KMPA has decided to introduce a series of training programs
to upgrade the knowledge of the managers, engineers and port operating personnel in KMPA and KCTA,
to make them more aware of the environmental implications of port planning, construction and operation.
The program will consist of a basic training program (2 days) for all KMPA, KCTA and KMI staff and
a series of specialized programs for selected professional staff. The specialized program will consist of
a 2-4 week training course in Environmental Management or Administration offered by the Environmental
Education Institute (EEI) under MOE, followed by 2 weeks of in-house technical environmental training
ftocusing on the environmental issues specific to KMPA's operation. This training will be combined with
2-4 month overseas visits and training at selected ports (possibly under twinning arrangements) or
institutions. Following the completion of the training program, selected participants will be offered
opportunities to pursue extended studies in environmental science or environmental engineering.
B.   Key Environmental Issues and Requirements
4.         Issues: The key issues pertaining to the management of the environment in port development
and operation can be divided into three broad categories: a) management and regulatory issues; b)
planning and construction; and c) operation and maintenance. The main topics in these issues are
presented below:



- 55  -                               ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 10
(a)   management and regulatorv issues
*    national and local environmental regulations;
*    port, harbor, coast guard and other relevant regulations;
*    local municipal regulations (planning, zoning etc.);
*    fire, health and safety regulations (including emergency response and contingency planning);
*    IMO and other international conventions and regulations pertaining to marine pollution and
ecosystems, transport of hazardous cargos and wastes, ship wastes and ocean dumping
conventions, management of dredged materials etc; and
*    on going management commitment including allocation of adequate operating resources,
public relations (including public participation, dealing with NGOs etc.), environmental
impact assessment, personnel, training etc.
(b)   planning and construction
acquisition of private and/or government land, displacement of people, houses, and
businesses, compensation and resettlement issues etc.;
*    encroachment of protected/sensitive ecological and conservation areas;
*    impact on the environment and amenities including air, noise, vibration, traffic, safety,
water quality, housing, labor etc.;
impact of reclamation including excavation for fill, dredging, dredged material disposal,
construction of piers, breakwaters and other structures; and
development of an environmental impact assessment (EIA) report including development of
TORs, hiring of consultants, management of studies, liaison with regulatory and other
agencies, public participation, management review etc.
(c)   operation and maintenance
*    operation and maintenance monitoring programs, including monitoring for air and water
quality, marine environment, solid and hazardous wastes disposal, noise, on-shore
receiving and treatment facilities, environmental indices etc.;
*    emergency response and marine spills contingency plans;
*    environmental health and safety training programs;



- 56  -                                ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 10
*    coordination with management and other KMPA departments, MOE, coast guard, customs,
local authorities, fire department, port security, civic organizations, stake holders and other
relevant organizations; and
*    preparation of environmental reports.
5.         Requirements: To deal with these issues effectively, it is important that KMPA, including
KCTA and KMI, should have the capability to:
*    understand the environmental issues and incorporate them into the planning and preparation
stages with due consideration to minimizing the adverse environmental effects and with
adequate allocation of budget to ensure effective implementation of the mitigation measures;
*    direct and coordinate the engineering and environmental work to be conducted by
consultants including the preparation of TORs and management ot contracts;
*    acquire adequate knowledge and experience in environmental monitoring including the
selection and acquisition of monitoring equipment, data gathering, data reporting etc; and
*    maintain close coordination with other concerned agencies, especially MOE, and the public
and/or the affected groups.
C.   Implementation
6.         Given the limited knowledge and experience of environmental matters in KMPA, it is
envisaged that consultants will be hired to develop the training material and carry out the basic and
specialized training except for the courses provided by MOE. The consultant will also design detailed
TORs t'or an overseas training program (either through direct or twinning arrangements with ports/port
authorities) in developed countries to enable selected KMPA, KCTA and KMI staff to gain port and
maritime related environmental experience. KMPA intends not to duplicate the current training program
being offered by the MOE but to supplement the MOE training with port and maritime specific
environmental training.
7.         In order to ensure effective implementation and participation in the training program,
KMPA management should make it clear that: (i) each KMPA staff member has a role and responsibility
towards the environmental well-being of the maritime sector; (ii) it is the responsibility of the all
divisions/offices to ensure full integration of environmental concerns into all aspects and stages of the
project development cycle including project construction, supervision, operation, maintenance and
monitoring; and (iii) each concerned division/office is responsible for environmental coordination and
cooperation within and outside KMPA. At present, there no single unit within KMPA responsible tor the
environment. Therefore, it is envisaged that at the initial stage, the Port Development Division (PDD)of
the Port Construction and Development Bureau will be responsible for development, coordination and
implementation of the training program. Later on, when alternative arrangements are made, such as, the
establishment of an Environmental Unit in KMPA, this responsibility can be transferred to the new unit.
When established, this unit should play a major role in the coordination of the environmentally related
activities inside and outside KMPA with strong support from the regional offices and KMI.

D.   Proposed Training Program
8.         Objectives: The primary objective is to increase the environmental awareness, understanding
and knowledge of the KMPA management and technical staff, including the district offices, KCTA and
KMI, of the key environmental issues including health and safety, related to the development,
construction and operation of port facilities and maritime activities. The second objective is to establish
an effective group of trained staff in KMPA knowledgeable about the technical environmental issues
facing KMPA and capable of dealing with them on a day-to-day basis. With this training, KMPA staff
generally will be better able to understand and identify potential problems and to work with the
environmental experts in the MOE, independent consultants, government officials, and the public.
9.         Training: The training program is designed to suit the short- and long-term needs of KMPA
and the training activities include both general and specific training in-country by local and international
experts; meetings/seminars/workshops; specific training abroad through secondment/exchange program;
and study tours. The technical program would cover EIA methodology, environmental management,
pollution control including marine pollution, dredging, dredged material disposal, emergency response,
monitoring, reporting etc. An in-country cooperative program would be established with MOE to avoid
duplication. A cooperative training/exchange program would also be established with appropriate
institutions (possibly through twinning arrangements) in developed countries for exchange of knowledge
and experience on environmental issues related to port and maritime activities and their environmental
costs/benefits.
10.        The training program would consist of the following key elements over a period of three
years:
(a)   Basic Training: The purpose of this training is to: a) provide general knowledge and
understanding of the broader environmental issues facing KMPA in its development and
management of ports and maritime activities; b)increase the awareness and knowledge of
the KMPA staff about the trends in international, national and local environmental
protection policies, legislation, directives, enforcement, penalties etc.; c) discuss the role
of MOE; d) discuss the relevant International Conventions and Agreements in the
management of marine environment; and e) focus on the policies and directives of KMPA
and how they reflect in the overall environmental management, the development of EIAs,
the role of NGOs, public participation, etc. The training will also cover broad environment
issues affecting port and harbor development, construction, operation, monitoring, reporting
etc. The program will be presented in two day classes and will be mandatory to all
KMPA, KCTA and KMI staff and the management.
(h)   Technical Environmental Training: The purpose of the technical training is to increase
the technical environmental knowledge and expertise of selected KMPA staff and engineers
responsible for the planning, design, construction, and operation of ports and other marine
projects. The training would be divided into three parts: a) local training by MOE (2-4
weeks) followed by in-house training by local consultants (2 weeks) to tie-in the
generic training by the MOE to the more KMPA and port specific issues; b) 2-4 months
overseas training and visits at selected ports or institutions; and c) for the selected
participants extended studies program in environmental sciences or environmental
engineering. The main elements of the technical training would include:

Terms of Reference for the
Environmental Training Program
A.   Introduction
1.         The Korea Maritime and Port Administration (KMPA) is the public sector agency
resp mnsible for the planning, construction and operation of Korea's 48 commercial and coastal ports. With
the recent emphasis on maintaining Korea's environment, KMPA plans to develop a better understanding
of the environmental issues confronting the port sector and improve its capability to manage and minimize
the negative environmental impacts due to ports development and operation.
2.         To begin addressing the environmental issues confronting the port and shipping sectors,
KMPA has decided to develop and implement a series of training programs to upgrade the environmental
knowledge of the managers, engineers and port operating personnel in KMPA and KCTA, and to make
them more aware of the environmental implications of port planning, construction and operation in their
day-to-day activities. KMPA envisages a training program consisting of a: (i) basic training program for
all KMPA, KCTA and KMI staff; and (ii) series of specialized programs for selected professional staff.
B.   Proposed Training Program
3.         Objectives: The primary objective of the training program is to increase the awareness,
understanding and knowledge of the KMPA management and technical staff, including staff in district
offices, KCTA and KMI, of the key environmental and health and safety issues related to the
development, construction and operation of port facilities and maritime activities. The second objective
is to establish an effective group of trained staff in KMPA knowledgeable about the technical aspects of
environmental issues facing KMPA and capable of dealing with them on a day-to-day basis. With this
training, it is envisaged that KMPA staff generally will be better able to understand and identify potential
environmental issues and problems and will be better able to deal with the environmental experts in the
MOE, independent consultants, government officials, and the public.
4.         Training Program: The training program should be designed to suit the short-term and
long-term needs of KMPA and the training activities should include both general and specific training in-
country by local and international experts; through meetings/seminars/workshops; and by providing
specific training abroad through secondment/exchange program; and study tours.
5.         The training program should consist of the following:
(i)   Basic Training: The basic training should : a) provide a general overview  and
understanding of the broader environmental issues facing KMPA in its development and
management of ports and maritime activities; b) increase the awareness and understanding
of the KMPA staff about the trends in international, national and local environmental
protection policies, legislation, directives, enforcement, penalties etc.; c) discuss the role
of MOE in the context of KMPA's operation; d) discuss the relevant National and
International Conventions and Agreements in the management ot marine environment and
their relevance to KMPA; and e) discuss the policies and directives of KMPA and how
they retlect in the overall management of environment in KMPA's operations, the
development of ElAs, the role of NGOs, public participation, personnel, training etc. The



- 61  -                                ANNEX 3
Page 8 of 10
training will also cover broad environmental issues affecting port and harbor development,
construction, operation, monitoring, reporting etc.
The program should be presented in two day classes and is to be mandatory to all KMPA,
KCTA and KMI staff, district office staff and the management.
(ii)   Technical Environmental Training: The purpose of the technical training is to increase
the technical environmental knowledge and expertise of selected KMPA staff and engineers
responsible for the planning, design, construction, and operation of ports and other maritime
facilities. The technical training should be divided into four parts: a) 2-4 weeks of local
training by the Environmental Education Institute (EEI) under MOE; followed by b) 2
weeks of in-house training by local consultants to tie in the generic training by EEI to
KMPA and port specific issues; c) 24 months of overseas training and visits through a
training arrangement at selected ports or institutions; and d) for the selected participants,
an extended studies program in environmental sciences or environmental engineering.
C.   Scope of Work
6.         The selected consultant, in consultation with KMPA, will be required to: a) develop in-house
training programs; b) where appropriate, deliver the in-house training; c) select meetings, seminars and
workshops to be attended by those participants receiving technical environmental training; d) select and
make appropriate arrangements with overseas institutions, ports etc. which are willing to provide
environmental training to KMPA staff; e) select overseas institutions of higher learning which offer
courses in environmental sciences and environmental engineering which would be appropriate for KMPA
staff to attend; and t) assist and advise KMPA on environmental training related matters.
7.         In particular, the selected consultant will:
(i)   develop a detailed outline of the two day in-house basic training program, bearing in mind
that the audience for the training will consist of all KMPA, staff with wide educational and
technical background;
(ii)  agree with KMPA about the contents of the course;
(iii)  develop a detailed schedule to implement the basic training program;
(iv)  develop course material, training manuals, audio/visual aids, quizzes, etc.
(v)  implement the training program;

in environmental engineering and sciences which could be of benefit to the participants and
KMPA in their long term strategy to develop an environmental expertise within KMPA; and
(xii)  assist and advise KMPA on training related matters and prepare a yearly report on the status
of the training program.
D.   Duration of the Assignment
8.         The proposed training program is expected to last for a period of 34 years.
9.         The basic program will be mandatory to all KMPA staff. It is anticipated that this program
will be offered to all KMPA, KCTA, KMI, and district staff and the management. The course is to be
offered on a monthly basis to 50-60 participants per month.
10.        The technical environmental program will be offered to approximately 12 selected staff
members per year. Those staff members who successtully complete the basic training plus EEI and the
follow up in-house training can participate in the overseas training/visits (2-4 months duration).
11.        From the selected participants, two participants per year will he chosen to undertake a
longer extended study course in environmental sciences or environmental engineering at overseas institutes
of higher education.
E.   Proposal
12.        Consultants are invited to submit proposals to KMPA outlining their interest, experience,

1.         Monitoring of project progress will be the responsibility of all units concerned with the
execution of the project. Monitoring will be summarized by the Director of the Port Development
Division in KMPA for those project components involving KMPA. Monitoring will be prepared for the
Pusan Phase IV component by the Vice President for Planning for KCTA. Project progress for the
KMPA components will be monitored using a Computerized Project Management System which will
provide outputs on the financial and physical status of each of the components. Each main area of
development under the project will be monitored on a continuous basis and reviewed with the Government
by the project review missions.
2.         In particular, progress of the following items will be included:
Construction of the Port cum Industrial Complex at Dadaepo
(a)   The ability of the special corporation created to construct the complex to raise sufficient
capital to start construction.
(h)   The average property values in the areas from which the timber and fish processing plants
will relocate to Dadaepo will rise to be equal to the average property values in comparable
areas in Pusan.
(c)   The PCG amends the current zoning for the areas from which the plants relocate to specify
that only residential and commercial property may locate in the vacated land.
Design and Implementation of the Ship Waste Disposal Facilities
(a)   Agreement on the "hub" ports to collect and dispose of the wastes generated by fishing and
coastal vessels.
(h)   Agreement on the institutional aspects of the project and the most efficient means to recover
the cost of the facilities.

PORTS DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Land Acquisition, Compensation & Relocation Practices
1.         Korean resettlement practice is based on the need to alleviate the economic and social
consequences of compulsory acquisition of land and assets. Fair and prompt compensation for losses
suffered underlie Korean law and practice. Displaced persons are assisted to regain their former living
standards, and income or production levels. Generally, their approach meets the requirements of the
Bank's policy as set forth in OD 4.30. However, this practice is inconsistent with the Bank's policy as
it does not provide for: (a) compensation for the lost assets at replacement cost; (b) compensation to non-
holders of legal titles; and (c) compensation to workers.
2.         Land Acquisition.  Acquisition proceedings by public agencies including provincial
governments, are governed by the "Special Law on Acquisition and Compensation of Lands for Public
Use", which has been in force since December 31, 1975. Mandatory land purchase for development
projects is covered by this law and is initiated by a public notice of the proposed land acquisition. Under
the law, the responsible project agency makes the initial surveys and investigations, prepares a
preliminary valuation of compensation payable for property, loss of livelihood, relocation expenses, etc
and torwards these estimates to the project implementation office for verification and discussion with the
affected persons. This normally occurs about six months in advance of finalization of the acquisition
proceedings, and is part of development plans that detail the relocation needs and compensation aspects.
3.         Almost simultaneously, the project agency refers these initial surveys to two private valuers,
who are licensed under the law to make independent valuations of compensation payable to the affected
persons. These independent valuations are made in accordance with guidelines framed under the law and
are based on the valuer's professional judgement after taking both market prices and book values into
consideration. The average published valuation of the two independent valuers' assessments form the
basis tfr final negotiations with the affected persons. Where no agreement is reached, the Ministry
concerned or the project agency must negotiate the purchase price with the landowners. In the event
these negotiations fail, the affected parties are entitled to make an appeal to a Land Expropriation Appeals
C *mniittee, which is set up under the Law by the concerned City or Province or the Ministry of
Construction as the case may be, to hear and adjudicate such cases between the parties and determine
compensation.
4.         Past experience indicates that about 10%  of affected persons make an appeal to this
Committee mainly to get a reassessment of property values based on anticipated appreciation resulting
from the proposed improvements tor which the land is being acquired. In the event that the Committee's
findings are unacceptable to the parties concerned, recourse is always available to the Courts under the
general laws. These proceedings normally take from 6-9 months.



- 73 -
ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 3
5.         Compensation. As stated earlier, compensation is determined by independent professional
valuations based on market prices and book values. Compensation is payable for both affected movable
and immovable property as well as for loss of crops and other assets, loss of livelihood (on average up
to three months of estimated foregone earnings), loss of house rental deposits of displaced tenants, and
relocation expenses. Relocation could be offered in a resettlement complex. Compensation was paid in
cash until 1993 but now an election could be made to be paid in government securities, which offer some
capital gains and tax concessions to land owners. Assistance is also generally provided to disadvantaged
families to relocate, find suitable accommodation, schooling and health facilities. Poorer families are
subsidized for the hardship caused by the relocation. Compensation is also payable to tenants who have
lived in the aftected house for at least three months.
6.         Relocation. The Special Law on Acquisition and Compensation of Lands referred to earlier
contains specific provisions on resettlement.  In addition to compensation, where more than ten
households are affected at one site, the project agency is expected to provide housing at a resettlement
site, including basic infrastructure, such as roads, water and sanitation. The criteria for eligibility under
the law is residence on the site to be acquired on the date of approval of the development plan for the
project. The Korean system of residency registration makes verification of eligibility easy. Owner
occupiers have the option to purchase a new plot of land at a discounted price or a price controlled
apartment on a priority basis. Provincial governments usually give first priority to displaced persons in
the allocation of units in public housing programs. Finally, project design aims to avoid or minimize
resettlement.
7.         Institutional Arrangements. To expedite the adjudication of cases in dispute, the law
established a Central Land Expropriation Committee in the Ministry of Construction and Local Land
Expropriation Committees in the major cities and in each Province. These committees have provided an
established institutional mechanism for dealing with land acquisition since 1975, also broadening the scope
of the policy for dealing with involuntary resettlement in the process. The Central Land Expropriation
Committee, which is the highest policy making and appellate body, is chaired by the Ministry of
Construction and includes judges, lawyers, professors of law and high ranking public servants. The
Ministry of Construction is, therefore, charged with the main responsibility for implementing the land
acquisition policy, which in practice is delegated to the appropriate enterprise, provincial or city authority
level.
Dadaepo Project Component Compensation Program
8.         Under the project, very few house and land owners are affected. KMPA has minimized the
amount of involuntary resettlement through the design of the complex and the location of the roads. In
total, resettlement/compensation is required for three houses which serve as both dwellings and small
beach-side restaurants, three mariculture farms raising seafood and covering an area of 650 ha, and eight
other vacant lots totaling about 90,000 sq.m. These owners will be offered about W15 billion in total
compensation and the owners of the three homes will be allowed to relocate to the reclaimed beach. The
estimated compensation was computed at a 40% premium over comparative October 1993 market prices.
9.         Compensation for the loss of business rights for the three restaurants, three mariculture
farms, fishermen holding licenses to fish in the site affected by the project, and the twenty-five restaurants



- 74 -
ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 3
discussed in paragraph 10 will be offered about W13 billion, depending on whether they are directly or
indirectly affected by the breakwater construction and sea reclamation. Those directly affected will be
offered compensation computed to cover earnings over an 8 year period, while those indirectly affected
will be partially compensated at 30% of earnings over a 2.5 year period. Owners of ten fishing boats
operating in the project area without license are not deemed to have fishery rights, and in accordance
with legislation enacted in August 1990, will not be compensated. However, they may obtain a license
to fish elsewhere.
10.        There are an additional twenty-five shops/buildings (primarily seafood restaurants) located
in the project area. The owners will be offered the opportunity to participate in the project. The existing
buildings will be taken down and the land reclaimed to a level equal to that of the adjacent industrial
complex. The cost to reclaim the land will be the responsibility of the current owners who will continue
to own the land. After construction of the complex and the introduction of better utilities to the area, it
is expected that the value of the land would increase above its current estimated value (plus reclamation
costs). The property owners will also have the choice to sell their land to the complex developer or to
other businessmen. Negotiations for this land will be started as soon as the legislation granting
authorization to the private operators to reclaim the land as a public purpose project has been approved
by the National Assembly. Draft legislation has been presented to the National Assembly, and it is
anticipated that it will be passed in mid 1994. Final agreements with these land owners may not be
finalized until early 1995.
Past Bank Experience In Korea With Resettlement
I1.        No major problems have been encountered in earlier Bank assisted projects.  In the
completed Chungju multipurpose project, US$172 million was spent compensating 9,300 families, 7,100
of whom were actually resettled, at a per family cost of over US$18,000. In the Taegu Urban Transport
Project, the provincial authorities compensated and relocated some 2,370 families. In a recent study,
OED has evaluated the resettlement outcome of the Chungju project and the First Water Supply Project
as satisfactory.

Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA)
A. EIA Requirements
1.         In Korea, the Basic Environmental Policy Law (BEPA) requires that an environmental
impact assessment (EIA) be prepared prior to the construction of port facilities and industrial complexes.
The EIA guidelines, issued by the Ministry of Environment (MOE), require, among other things, public
consultation prior to approval of such projects by MOE. Public announcement is made through
newspapers and public notices and the EIA report is exhibited for public review and comment for 20
days. Results of the consultation are considered during the preparation of the final report and the
comments and opinions of individuals and concerned agencies are documented in the report. The
implementing agency is responsible for the preparation of the EIA and for the implementation of the
mitigation measures and monitoring program. MOE is responsible for the review and approval of the
EIA and the periodic monitoring of its compliance. The penalty for noncompliance may result in
imprisonment for one year or a fine of up to W5 million. In December 1993, the BEPA was revised and
public hearings are now required upon request by the residents. The EIA process and guidelines used
in Korea have been reviewed and found to be satisfactory.
2.         The project comprises five components: (i) ship waste disposal facilities (SWDF); (ii) vessel
traftic management systems (VTMS); (iii) construction of a port and industrial complex at Dadaepo
(Dadaepo component); (iv) construction of a container terminal in Pusan Port (Pusan Phase IV
component); and (v) technical assistance and training. The Dadaepo and Pusan Phase IV components are
the only project components that require the preparation of an EIA. The English summaries of the
reports were prepared and sent to the Bank separately. During appraisal in March 1994, the final EIA
reports, the actions that have been and/or will be taken to deal with the environmental issues, and other
related information were reviewed and the results are presented below.
B. EIA for Dadaepo Component
3.         Descri2tion  A new port capable of serving 5,000-50,000 DWT ships and an industrial
complex would be built in a cove at Dadaepo Bay. The total land area would be about 1,687,000 m2
of which 96% would be reclaimed up to the level of about 3.26 m above mean sea level. The main port
facilities include two breakwaters (900 in and 180 m), a 500 m seawall, a 1,940 m quay, and a ship
channel of 300 m wide and 11.5-14.5 m deep. Kuen Sol mountain and a small island which are located
in the proposed site, would be demolished and used as landfill. About 900,000 m3 of bottom sediment
would be dredged and disposed of at sea in an area approved by MOE. The sediment has weak
characteristics and is not suitable for use in reclamation. A 2,160 m long seawall would be built along



- 76 -
ANNEX8
Page 2 of 12
the boundary of the Nakdong River preservation area to prevent damage to the area. About 950,000 m3
of rocks, 1.65 million m3 of soil, and 9.05 million m3 of sea sand would be required for construction.
The rock and soil would be obtained from the demolition of Kuen Sol mountain and the near by island.
The remaining material would be acquired and transported by trucks from the nearby quarry sites. The
sea sand would be acquired from the area offshore of the Nakdong river mouth about 3 km from the
proposed site. After completion of the construction, the industrial complex would be developed. Of the
total area, about 65% would be allocated for timber processing factories and storage yard, 22% for
marine-product processing factories, 8% for Hanjin heavy industry, and 5% tor green areas and other
public facilities. An access road will be built at the site to provide direct transportation of products from
the port and industrial complex to the existing road network.
4.         Analysis of Alternative Sites The Dadaepo area has been designated for the development
of an industrial complex for many years, and the initial feasibility studies determined that the least cost
solution would be to construct the port and a large portion of the industrial complex on reclaimed land
in the Nakdong River. The primary reason for this decision was due to the shallow water depth in the
river as opposed to the deep water in Dadaepo Bay. In 1992, soon after the KMPA had decided to
develop a new port in Dadaepo area, a meeting was conveyed with local officials, residents in Dadaepo
area, and university researchers in Pusan. The issue discussed during the meeting was on the location
of the port. Between the two proposed sites: the Nakdong River and the Dadaepo Bay, the majority of
the participants indicated their preference for the river side despite the fact that it is designated as the
natural preservation area. The outcome of the meeting was, however, overruled by MOE since the area
is protected by law. After lengthy discussions, it was agreed that the complex would be constructed in
the Bay and up to the boundary of the natural preservation area under three conditions: no encroachment
of the natural preservation boundary, no port activity along the Nakdong River side, and no waste water
runoff into the Nakdong River. The basic design for the component was made based on this agreement.
5.         EIA study and approval.  The Korea Maritime and Port Authority (KMPA) is the
implementing agency for this component. The EIA study was prepared as part of the feasibility study
with assistance from consultants: Daewoo Engineering Company, Woobo Engineering Company,
Hanyang University, Pusan University, and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology. The EIA
study was conducted from June 1992 to October 1993 and the report was prepared in accordance with
MOE's guidelines. Public consultation was also conducted as required by law. The tinal report was
prepared given due consideration to the comments received and was submitted to MOE in March 1994.
Approval of the EIA for this component is anticipated in May 1994.
6.         EIA review. Review of the baseline condition showed that the proposed site is located at
Dadaepo in Saha district (gu) and is mostly surrounded by mountains and the sea. Industrial and
residential areas are located in the northern part and a new apartment complex is being developed near
the proposed site. The Nakdong preservation area is located along the west boundary. Molundae
Mountain is located in the south and fisheries and seaweed cultures are common in the area. Dadaepo
Bay is located on the east and is being used as a fishing port and for other industrial purposes.
Measurement of environmental conditions indicate high concentrations of suspended parti_ulates (TSP)
near the proposed site and relatilely high concentrations of nutrients and Ph, Zn, Cu, and Cd in water
and sediment samples taken from Dadaepo Bay. No detected levels of Cr+6 in water samples and of
Hg, As, and CN in sediment samples were reported.

7.         The EIA study concluded that implementation of this project will benefit the city's economy
and will contribute significantly to the reduction of traffic congestion and to the risk of road accidents.
Negative impacts, however, are inevitable, but most of them are minor and/or can be minimized.
Description of the impacts and the mitigation measures on the marine environment, including oil spills,
land and marine traffic, disposal of dredged spoiled, and the proposed quarry sites were found to be
inadequate. Supplementary information was requested and submitted to the Bank in early May. The EIA
report, including the supplementary was again reviewed and found to be satisfactory.
8.         During construction, the impacts on the quarry site for rocks and soil would be minimized
under a separate EIA which is already approved by MOE for each quarry site. Demolition of the Kuen
Son mountain and the island and construction of the breakwaters would be done carefully to minimize
the impact due to blasting. Acquiring sea sand from the proposed area does not require an EIA approval,
and it is located far away from the Nakdong preservation area. According to the standards used in the
Netherlands (World Bank Technical Report No. 126), the levels of Cd, Zn, and Cu in sediment samples
taken from the area to be dredged lie between the "reference level" and the "testing value" and thus open
water disposal is permitted under certain conditions. The levels of Pb, however, are within the
"reference value" where restriction for disposal is not required. To mitigate the impact, dredging would
be controlled to minimize disturbance, and the dredged spoil would be reanalyzed for levels of heavy
metals. If necessary, measures will be taken to prevent contamination of the disposal sites, and a pump
dredging ship would be used to minimize the generation of SS levels. Effective silt protectors would be
installed when constructing breakwaters and sea walls, dredging, and reclamation. Monitoring of SS
would be done and working hours adjusted if the SS levels exceed 25 mg/l.
9.         About 60 trucks per day are expected in order to transport the necessary construction
materials. With completion of the new road along the Nakdong River, no serious impact is expected
from this traffic. Measures will be taken to minimize the level of air and noise pollution due to traffic.
In addition, the construction equipment will comply with the legal standards, and greenbelt and sound
proof walls would be installed as appropriate. To deal with wastes, mobile toilets would be provided,
and all waste materials would be collected and disposed of according to Pusan City waste management
plans and regulations.
10.        During operation, the discharge of any kind of waste into the Nakdong River would be
prohibited. All waste and storm water from the complex and port facility would be collected and treated
in a separate treatment plant (capacity 20,000 m3/d) to be constructed at the complex. The proposed
discharge area is located in the south and no adverse impact on water quality is expected near the
discharge area. The general solid waste would be collected and disposed of at the new landfill site of
the city (Sang Guk Dong, Kang Seo Gu, 11.6 million m3 capacity, EIA approved). Possible impacts due
to vermin and other diseases that may come with the importation of timber is unlikely since it is a normal
practice that all timber be treated in the vessel before unloading. In Saha district, the water supply
service was 0.16 million m3/d and a service rate is nearly 100%. About 141,500 m3/d of wastewater
was generated and 280,000 m3/d was treated at Janglim STP (capacity 300,000 m3/d).  High
concentrations of heavy rmetals in Dadaepo Bay is likely to be due to the discharge and/or water runoff
from the existing heavy inidustries located near the head of the Bay. According to the sewerage expansion
plan ftr langlim STP, waste water generated from this area will be collected and treated. The impacts
and mitigation measures are summarized in Table A-l.

11.        Consultation with the affected groups is another key issue of concern to MOE. The
consultation and compensation process was reviewed and found to be satisfactory. The consultation was
carried out at an early stage (during site selection) and the results were considered in the decision making
process. The initial version of the EIA was made available to the public in November 1993. Written
comments from 260 individuals (out of 1,500 who saw the notice) were obtained at the end of the public
announcement, of which 44.5 % objected to the project and 55.5 % agreed with the project providing that
adequate compensation and mitigation measures are taken to reduce traffic and to protect the environment.
The primary objections to the project focused on compensation, changes in employment, loss of land by
the residents, inadequate consultation with residents, loss of sandy beach and fishing grounds, destruction
of scenery area and impact on Molundae cultural area, serious pollution due to timber and fishery
industries, and the preference to see the area to be developed as residential area. Another consultation
was again carried out in January 1994 as part of the final EIA preparation. Attempts were made by
KMPA to hold a meeting with residents to explain and discuss the project. About 289 people attended
the meeting, but the explanation and discussion were not possible due to the different opinions of the
fishing community about compensation and the impact of the project on their livelihood due to the loss
of fishing grounds.
12.        The resettlement and compensation issue was dealt with in the feasibility study report and
a compensation plan was prepared and submitted to the Bank before appraisal. The plan was reviewed
and site visits and discussions with officials and the potential private investors were carried out during
appraisal. The results are presented in Annex 9. It was recognized that in the basic design and
compensation program, efforts were made to minimize involuntary resettlement and provide fair
compensation to the affected groups.
C. EIA for Pusan Phase IV component
13.        Description This component involves the construction of a container terminal capable of
serving four 50,000 ships in Pusan Port. The implementation period for this component is 1991-1996
and the three main activities are:
* Construction of the container terminal and procurement of equipment. The total container
yard area is 798,802 m2 of which 81 % would be reclaimed. The terminal area extends into
the sea up to 598 m from the existing shoreline and the total length of wharf is 2,968 m.
Reclamation and construction of the wharf will be made using the "Paper Drain" method.
About 625,000 m3 of rock would be acquired from the existing quarry site (Suk Mountain)
located at the mouth of Nakdong River; the stone would be transported to the project site
(28 km) via barges. Most of the landfill materials would be obtained from the dredging of
the ship channel;
* Dredging of the existing ship channel (350 m wide). The direction of the channel would
be modified and 150 m of the southern breakwater of the inner hay would be removed. The
total dredging area is about 2.84 km2 and 11.6 million m3 of bottom sediment would be
dredged and used for reclaniation; and



- 79 -
ANNEX 8
Page 5 of 12
* Construction of a 4-lane elevated expressway of 3.5 km long (called the 4th Phase
Expressway) connecting the existing Woo Am Road at Kamman Dong and the #2
Expressway at Moonhyun. Land acquisition would not be required.
14.        EIA study and approval, The Korean Container Terminal Authority (KCTA), under the
supervision of KMPA, is the implementing agency for this component. The EIA study was carried out
as part of the feasibility study with assistance from consultants, the Taeyoung Engineering and the Korea
Technological Development Public Corporation. The EIA study was conducted from August 1990 to July
1991 and the report was prepared according to MOE's guidelines and the final report was submitted to
MOE in late July 1991. Public consultation was later carried out and the results indicated no public
objections subject to adequate compensation being provided to the fishermen and women divers who made
a living, although illegally, in the area.
15.        No separate site analysis was conducted for this component since the site is in an
industrial/port area and it was identified several years ago as the location for the next container terminal.
16.        The EIA for this component was approved by MOE in December 1991 and its approval
.Londitions are summarized as follows:
* During construction, installation of drainage, reservoir, soil stabilization, landscaping are
required in the areas where erosion is anticipated. For dredging and reclamation, the soft
ground must be strengthened by Deep Cement Mixing method, the reclamation carried out
by Paper Drain method, and the dredging must be done using pumps and silt protectors in
the appropriate areas. When SS is over 25 ppm, the construction period has to be reduced
and/or the method adjusted. For reduction of air and noise pollution, implementation of
flying dust reduction measures including car washing, regular water spraying, using low
vibrating machines, controlling working hours, installing sound-proof panels, and restricting
car speed are required. If blasting is required, minimize the amount of dynamite, and
provide early notification of explosions. All stone should be delivered by barges; and
* During operation, proper measures must be taken including sending waste water to
Yongho treatment plant, installing proper measures (screen, settling pond) to prevent the
possibility of waste discharge into the sea during rainy days, treatment of ship waste oil by
sub-contractors, securing oil fence and chemicals in case of oil spill, installing sound proof
walls at both ends of the elevated expressway, and implementing the monitoring plan. To
reJuce the impact on water flow, remove 150 m of the south-inner bay breakwater and 200
m of the north-inner bay breakwater. To prevent damage to residents, the detailed plan of
daily construction and the amount and use of construction facilities should be made public.
If damage is inevitable in certain areas, proper compensation should be made to prevent any
complaints from residents. The compensation plan for those to be directly affected by the
project should be made and implemented. A post management plan should be made and
implemented and the results should be written following the specified format and submitted
annually to the MOE Regional Office in Pusan in January. Any changes to these mitigation
measures must be approved by MOE in advance.

Page 6 of 12
17.        EIA review. Review of baseline conditions showed that the proposed site is located on the
eastern shore of Pusan outer bay at the site between the mouth of the inner bay and the Pusan 3rd phase
container terminal. Two seaweed cultural areas are located near the mouth of the outer bay. The
discharge of Dongchon stream still flows into Pusan Bay (BOD 3646 mg/I). Measurements of the
environmental quality in the area showed relatively high levels of nutrients, oil/grease, COD, Zn, Cu
compared to the standards. The levels of Cd, Pb, and Cr +6 were also detected, but within the standards.
In the bottom sediment, no contamination of CN, Hg, and As was found. The levels of Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu
are slightly over the "reference value" according to the Netherlands standard. Since, all of the dredged
spoil would be used for reclamation, the proposed dredging technique is considered acceptable. The level
of air quality was relatively better than the average level in Pusan City. High levels of noise, exceeding
the standards, were observed.
18.        The study concluded that implementation of the project would increase capacity and
efficiency of the container handling services in Pusan Port and would benefit the city of Pusan as well
as the nation's economy. Removing part of the existing inner breakwaters would increase water flow in
the inner bay. Negative impacts, however, are inevitable and the major impacts and the proposed
mitigation measures are briefly summarized in Table A-2.
19.        The final report was reviewed along with other related information, and found to be
satisfactory. In 1992, KMPA/KCTA and the affected fishermen and women divers negotiated the level
of compensation based on an assessment prepared by the Marine Research Institute and National Fisheries
University of Pusan. A total amount of about W232 million ($290,000) was paid to 16 fishermen
(including their boats) and 8 women divers in July-December 1992.
20.        Construction of the embankment and part of the reclamation were carried out in 1992, and
this component is expected to be completed by the end of 1997. Silt protectors were installed and SS
levels are monitored every month. As of end 1993, over 26% of the total work has been completed and
over 36% of land has been reclaimed. According to the MOE's report in early 1993, most of the EIA
conditions were followed. In May-December 1993, 150 m of the south-inner bay breakwater was
removed at a cost of about WI .3 billion ($1.6 million). Removal of 200 m of the north-inner breakwater
will he made when the container yard is expanded at a later stage. No public complaints were recorded
during the construction of this component. KCTA plans to submit the post-environmental management
plan and results of the monitoring to MOE Pusan regional office by the end of January 1994.
E. Environmental Capacity and Institutional Needs,
21.        KMPA/KCTA. According to the BEPA, the implementing agency is responsible for the
preparation of the EIA, implementation of the mitigation measures, and monitoring of the environmental
quality and the impacts. The existing capacity of KMPA and KCTA to deal with the environmental issues
related to the port construction and operation, including monitoring, needs to be strengthened as soon as
possible. A training program has been developed and agreed upon as part of the technical assistance
component of the project (Annex 6). In addition, technical assistance will be provided in the project to
develop sample TORs for EIA studies, and standard operating procedures and engineering guidelines will
be prepared to retrofit existing port facilities to minimize the pollution caused by port operations.

ANNEX 8
Page 7 of 12
22.        Coordination and cooperation among concerned agencies is also a key issue, especially in
the area of consultation to the affected groups, waste management, and oil spill contingency plan. The
EIA report for Pusan 4th Phase identified the need to establish an oil spill management office in KMPA
to monitor careless discharge of ship wastes and waste oil and to prepare equipment and chemicals
necessary to deal with oil spills, but no details was given. The possibility to establish a separate office
responsible for oil spills was discussed in KMPA, but not much progress has been realized. Efforts
would be made during the implementation of the project to address this issue.

PORTS DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Methodologies for Determining Environmental Costs
and Benefits of Port Projects
A. Introduction
1.            The focus of this Annex is on environmental issues of particular relevance in determining
the feasibility of specific port investment components. A case has been selected which covers a broad
range of methodological issues concerning environmental impacts that a port authority (national or local)
is likely to face.
2.            The case relates to the relocation of polluting industrial activities and port facilities
serving these activities within city boundaries to more appropriate sites. Such relocation decisions involve
major land reclamation, land-use changes and resettlement which require careful planning and the
implementation of appropriate compensatory measures. Rapid urbanization often results in co-habitation
of residential and industrial activities which are often polluting, and accelerate environmental degradation
even further because of the accompanying truck traffic which moves between industrial sites and the port.
Proposals to relocate these activities, as well as the port facilities which serve them, outside of residential
areas requires that the analysis be broadened from the rather narrow base provided by a cost effectiveness
valuation to a full cost-benefit analysis which defines and compares alternatives, quantifying (as far as
meaningfully possible) environmental impacts, both positive and negative. An important input to such
analyses is the identification and measurement of dose-response relationships of environmental impacts.
Some of the positive impacts resulting from relocation would include: reduced industrial pollution in and
around existing industrial sites and other reductions in pollution resulting directly from decreased truck
traffic (i.e. congestion, accidents, etc.). One of the main negative impacts would include the diversion
of industrial pollution to the new sites and their surrounding areas. The particular case chosen for
illustraltive purposes also shows the costs of foregoing a low-cost alternative in favor of a much costlier
one which is certain to have no adverse environmental impacts on a unique wetland area of crucial
importance to migratory birds and the local marine ecosystem.
3.            This case can also be expanded into dealing with the relocation of traditional port
activities, which are increasingly affected by urban growth, to a new and "virgin" location far removed
from potential negative impacts and limitations of urban development. In those cases where port and
urban activities are in serious conflict (social, environmental as well as economic), and where the port's
main clients are increasingly beyond the boundaries of the city in which it resides, a case may be made
for limiting port growth and shifting relevant traftic to a new location. In the case chosen, the analysis
explores the diminishing central role of housing certain port related activities in the city; the increasing
environmental costs to the population for maintaining the current role of the port; and the viability of
developing a "sister port" far removed from the city, but one where present shipper/client relationships

ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 12
are not adversely affected, and where future increases in port traftic can be accommodated without undue
pressure associated with urban development. In this case, development at the city port is limited to
facilities in operation, while the full cost-benefit analysis focuses on the future role of the city port, taking
into consideration changes in transport costs, as well as the scope for diversion of port traffic to a "sister
port" free of those negative social and physical environmental impacts which would so adversely affect
the ec 'nomy and environment of the port city in question. These expansion aspects of the methodology
will, however, not be pursued further in this Annex.
B. Case Study: The Korean Experience of Site Selection for Joint Industrial
and Port Relocation in Pusan; the Role of Environmental Considerations
4.           In order to illustrate the issues addressed in Section 1 above, the following Korean port
and urban development project components are discussed in detail and include the relocation of: (a)
timber and fishery terminals from the central port area; and (b) polluting timber and fish processing plants
from within residential areas in the city (Pusan) to an industrial site adjacent to Pusan Port (Dadaepo)
developed specifically for the purpose. The Dadaepo project components have been classified "Category
A" and as a result require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which includes public hearings.
In terms of social impact one important element of the EIA includes a careful mapping of potential
involuntary resettlement of people plus an appropriate plan for removal and compensation of those
aftfected.
5 .           These investments require economic and environmental quantification of costs and benefits
to determine the extent to which Pusan and Korea will benefit from the proposed relocations, the goals
of which are to: (a) reduce congestion and associated transport costs including related environmental
damage resulting from excessive traffic between the port terminals for timber and fish, and their
processing areas, which are, in many cases, far from the port; (b) improve the environment in and around
those residential and commercial areas affected by the present timber and fisheries processing plants and
timber and fisheries port facilities; and (c) minimize the negative environmental impacts around the
proposed Dadaepo-location, with particular emphasis on protection of the marine ecosystem at the mouth
of the Nakdong River.
6.            The initial design of the Dadaepo project entailed land reclamation and construction of
port and industry facilities on the east bank of the lower Nakdong River, i.e. the western side of
Dadaepo. T'his area was considered well protected against the ocean, and as a result minor breakwater
investments would be required. However, in the lower Nakdong river is a famous wetland area serving
as transit base for a large variety of migrating birds and constitutes an integral part of the local marine
ecosystem of which these birds are a key component. The Ministry of Environment considers this wetland
area and the surroundings so fragile and threatened that an area covering the island, the lower reaches
of the river, and part of the Nakdong River shores of Dadaepo has been established as an environmental
protection area. The initial Dadaepo project design assumed that the part of the protected shores along
the east bank of the Nakdong River needed for the project would he exempted from the protection clause,
since it was uncertain to what extent the marine ecosystem and the migratory tlows and pattern of birds
would be adversely affected. Such uncertainty was unacceptable to the Ministry of Environment. As a
precautionary measure, the port authorities proposed an alternative Dadaepo project design facing the
cove on the east side of Dadaepo. This Cove alternative is completely sheltered from the Nakdong river
and thus would have no environmental impact on the protected area. However, this alternative is exposed



- 89 -
ANNEX 9
Page 3 of 12
to the open sea, and requires extensive breakwater construction at very high costs in order to provide for
safe port and shipping operations. Both alternatives would yield substantial reclamation of land needed
for the relocation of port and industrial activities, but more such land would be reclaimed in the Nakdong
alternative. Such land is scarce and valuable in Pusan. Both alternatives will relieve existing residential
areas of industry and traffic pollution, compared to the "base case" alternative of not relocating the timber
and t;heries port and associated industrial processing activities in the feasibility analysis, but with more
industrial activities relocated with the Nakdong alternative, inland transport cost savings and related
environmental improvements will be greater. It is important to keep in mind that the impacts of
technological progress, anti-pollution measures and traffic policy measures undertaken in Pusan during
the projected life of the project, will affect both the "base case" and the two alternative Dadaepo
alternatives.
C. Environmental Economic Project Benefits and Costs
7.            In addition to conventional economic costs and benefits that can be determined using
market prices, the Dadaepo project components require that a series of direct and/or indirect valuation
methods be used to establish estimated values of some important environmental impacts associated with
the proposed project (see section D below). All components are calculated net of taxes in fixed prices.
Apriori it would be expected that the appraisals would depend fundamentally on changes
in iAnd use and associated changes in traffic. The reason is that variations in traffic will yield variations
ip ihe amount of congestion and environmental spillovers avoided with the proposed project components,
thus substantially impacting appraisal results.
9.            The socioeconomic costs of environmental damage may in principle be quantified on the
basis of the following, although in determining these costs great care must be taken to avoid double
countiig:
(a)    Reduced export earnings potential;
(h)    Reduced incomes for commercial and artisan fishermen;
(c)    Reduced availability of protein source;
(d)    Employment loss;
(e)    Increased incidence of human disease and mortality;
(t)    Loss of productive days of work;
(g)    Pollution damage to build up; structures/buildings/machinery;



- 90 -
ANNEX 9
Page 4 of 12
(h)    Reduced attractiveness of coastal zones/shorelines for residential and recreational
activities; and
(i)    Transport and congestion impacts.
10.           The main environmental and economic costs and benefits attributable to the proposed
Dadaepo components include:
(a)    Physical Changes and Resource Uses (other than those associated with traffic) resulting
from construction and operation of new port facilities are included in the analysis as
project costs.
(b)    Physical Changes and the accompanying Economic. Ecological and Social Impacts
(other than traffic) resulting from relieved pressures in the present timber and fisheries
terminal areas in the port are included in the analysis as project benefits.
(c)    Physical Changes and Ecological and Socioeconomic Impacts (other than traffic)
resulting from relocation of the timber and fish processing plants to Dadaepo are included
as both costs and benefits.
(d)    TraMc Impacts, i.e. changes in amount of traffic and associated changes in direct
vehicle costs, road investments and maintenance costs, and the indirect costs of pollution
and traffic accidents.
1i.           Korean data, or alternatively, comparable and transferable empirical knowledge from
elsewhere, would be used to determine the extent of quantification possible respecting the above impacts.
This information would be used to establish reduced or increased damage from the proposed project
components relative to the existing situation: (a) maintaining timber, and (b) fish processing operations
in the existing respective port terminals and processing areas.
D. Valuing the Environmental Changes
12.           There are several economic valuation methods available for determining the environmental
costs and benefits of developing the Dadaepo site to replace the existing timber and fish terminal and
timber and fishing processing areas.
13.           The two main methodologies which may be used include: an indirect approach based on
surrogate market prices, and a direct approach based on "willingness to pay" interviews with those



- 91 -
ANNEX 9
Page 5 of 12
affected. In the former category, the discussion is limited to the so called "property value" method.' The
theoretical assumptions and practical conditions determining the appropriateness of each method as they
relate to this particular project are briefly discussed below.
The Property Value Method (Hedonic Price)
14.           Property values are affected by many variables including size, use, construction, location,
and quality of its environment. When the impact of all variables other than the environment are controlled
or regulated, much of the price differential between similar units of property can be related to
environmental impact.
15.           Fundamental to the validity of this valuation method (referred to as the hedonic price
valuation method) is: (a) that property purchasers reveal their attitude to the various property attributes
by their willingness to pay; (b) that there exists an efficiently functioning property market which allows
the various property attributes to be reflected in price; (c) that the actors in the property market have fair
access to value relevant property information (zoning plans, infrastructure development plans, etc. that
are likely to influence key property attributes); and (d) that there are a sufficient number of property
transaLtions taking place with relevant properties so that price variations respecting environmnental
variable(s) of interest to project valuation can be traced with some satisfactory degree of confidence.
16.           Typically, multiple regression analysis is applied to a large set of property transactions
in the relevant study area. This determines the coefficient of the environmental variables of interest with
the estimated coefficients expressing the value of an incremental change in the variables in question.
17.           Alternatively, still assuming that the above (a) - (c) conditions are satisfied, but short of
the necessary actual transactions (d), a secondary approach is to supplement whatever transaction data
available with property value estimates from real estate agents that know the area in question.
18.           Both approaches have been tried out extensively in many countries to determine
environmental impacts. The derived environmental values have been compared to environmental values
derived hy means of the direct contingent valuation method whereby a sample of users are asked to reveal
The other most common surrogate price approach to estimating environmental value is the so
called "Travel Cost Method" whereby the incidence of travel from a zone to a given site is used
to derive the demand, i.e. the willingness to pay for environmental amenities identified at the site
in question. The assumption is that the longer the distance from the zone to the site, the greater
the cost of going there compared to going to a competing site, and as a result, demand for the
site in question drops as the costs of going there increases. Research in recent years have found
that the assumptions that need to be satisfied in order that this method shall give satisfactory and
reliable results for use in project appraisal, are so unrealistic that the entire method has lost
contidence as a means to pricing and valuing the environment.

their willingness to pay for environmental improvements, or to pay for avoiding environmental worsening
(see tollowing section). Recent research suggests that there is convergence in the estimates derived by
the two methods when conducted properly2.
The Contingent Valuation Method (CVM)
19.          Contingent valuation is a direct valuation method whereby affected people are asked about
their willingness to pay for an environmental improvement or to avoid a deterioration in environmental
quality. Such willingness to pay can be motivated by both use value (the monetary value people place on
being able to physically use the resource, e.g. the recreational value of some activity) and non-use values
(the monetary value motivated by the desire to preserve the environment for now and the future).
20.           The use of the CV method requires careful design and testing of the survey questionnaire
before it can be assured that the respondents are in fact revealing an unbiased willingness to pay. As in
all economics, it is fundamental to the validity of the analysis that the subjects interviewed have adequate
knowledge of the alternatives and changes they are asked to value. People are typically asked hypothetical
questions such as: "If this happens, what would you be willing to pay?" Due to the hypothetical nature
of this method, several biases may occur3.
21.          In spite of the potential biases, the CV method, if properly designed, offers a unique
possibility for finding the "total value", i.e. both the use and non-use values, including the value of future
environmental changes.
E. Proposed Project Appraisal Framework
22.           The main objectives of the proposed Dadaepo developments are to:
Reduce the costly waiting time of ships due to port congestion which results in time-consuming discharge
at lighterage stations:
(a)    reduce the high stevedoring costs resulting from continued use of lighterage stations;
(b)    reduce the operating costs per truck trip which is based, among other things, on the
number and running distance of those trucks required to carry out transport services
between the port and the processing areas;
(c)    reduce air pollution from timber and fish truck traftic;
(d)    reduce the number of related truck traffic accidents;
For an extensive state-of-the-art survey of theory and practice, see Stale Navrud (editor) 1993,
"Pricing the European Environment", Scandinavian University Press, Oslo.
See Stale Navrud (Editor), 1993, op. cit. for a detailed discussion of the various biases, and how
the methodology has been developed and tested to eliminate such biases.

(e)    reduce the road investment and maintenance requirements resulting from heavy truck
traffic;
(t)    reduce the incidence and extent of environmental disturbances (noise, air pollution, visual
ugliness, etc.), in particular for those residential and recreational areas adjacent to the
present processing plants, and to the timber and fish terminals respectively, by relocating
the these plants to Dadaepo;
(g)    reduce congestion costs for other traffic; and
(h)    reduced air pollution from swifter movement of other traffic.
23.           However, the project components will also generate some environmental costs in the form
of:
(a)    Reduced residential and recreational attractiveness at Dadaepo where there is now a beach
and complementary recreational activities;
(b)    Compensation to fisherfolk for loss of income from fishery rights at Dadaepo and
compensation to those businesses/landowners whose properties require expropriation; and
(c)    Depending on the actual site-specific Dadaepo layout adopted, i.e. the Cove versus the
Nakdong alternative, there could be an environmental cost related to site-selection,
stemming from potential marine ecosystem impacts on the wetlands of the Nakdong River
mouth.
24.           The Dadaepo analysis assumes a declining growth rate in timber traffic as compared to
historic data, from a 3.8% annual growth between 1996 and 2001, to 0.5% between 2001 and 2006, and
then 0.5% after 2006. At the same time, it is assumed that the share of processed lumber in overall
timbe. imports will increase from 10% in 1996 to 30% by 2011.
25.           For the affected fish processing industries, the overall imports of raw fish is expected to
almost double between 1991 and 2011. Containerized imports constituted 14% of imports in 1992, but
is expected to triple in volume, and the share is projected to rise to 20% by 2011. Exports of processed
fish products are projected to almost double as well, but here the containerized share, which had reached
33% in 1991, is projected to increase only marginally to 36% by 2011.
26.          It is the projected development in these two processing sectors, and the associated
demands on port facilities, street space and vehicle use, and land for location of processing facilities that
determines the feasibility of the proposed Dadaepo developments. The feasibility analysis has taken the
following components into account.
27.          The construction costs for the Dadaepo port facilities, including land reclamation for the
timber and fish processing areas have been estimated at market price on a yearly basis for each of the
. *nstruction stages, and have been applied to both the Nakdong River and the Cove alternatives. The
operations and maintenance costs have been estimated on the basis of past experience in Korea.

ANNEX 9

28.           The economic value of conventional improvements based on reduced truck traffic
operating costs, reduced ship waiting time and cargo handling costs has been estimated by: (a)
determining annual truck operation costs and the resultant savings accrued from a reduction in travel
distance from the new port terminals to the new processing facilities; (b) the associated time savings for
drivers; (c) the resulting savings in road maintenance and investment costs; (d) determining vessel costs
resulting from delays attributable to lighterage, used in cases where port facilities are unavailable; (e)
determining savings resulting from decreased handling of cargo due to lighterage.
29.           The economic value of reclaimed land for use as port and processing facilities, as assessed
by real estate assessors with extensive local knowledge of the commercial real estate market
30.           The economic value of environmental improvements from reduced truck traffic over the
project life have been estimated on the basis of referenced studies (Korean) and projected income levels.
Referenced US methodology for valuing: (a) air quality improvements and noise reductions on affected
people and property; and (b) savings from reduced number of traffic accidents, has been applied to these
studies.
31.           The economic value of environmental improvements based on property value changes
around: (a) the present timber and fish terminals; and (b) the present timber and fish processing areas,
have been estimated on the basis of assessments by local real estate agents. The basis for their assessment
is a mixture of contingent valuation (since these agents are presented with visual aids showing the planned
development and can see how the residential and recreational areas will be affected) and their experience
with regard to property value differentials for the rather homogenous high rise apartments with and
without such port--and industrial activities--nearby.  It is claimed that sufficient observations exist to
make a reliable assessment of property price changes.

Environmental Benerit Cost Analysis of Dadaepo Port
Development: Appraisal Results
A. Introduction
1.       In the following, the assumptions and methodology used to determine the robustness/sensitivity
of the benefit-cost conclusions with regard to some key (and controversial) enviromnental parameter
values are presented. The purpose is to clarify for decision makers what assumptions actually underpin
the conclusions.
2.       After an analysis of alternative sites, the results focus on the Cove alternative where both
timber and fish will be received at the port, and where both timber and fish processing plants will be
relocated. The rejected Nakdong alternative was planned for timber processing plants only, but many
more than in the Cove alternative. No fish processing plants were planned for relocation in the Nakdong
case.
3.       The Cove alternative implies substantially higher investment costs, compensation costs,
operation and maintenance cost (because these latter costs are calculated as a fixed percentage of
construction costs), as compared to the Nakdong alternative. The Nakdong alternative, on the other hand,
would imply twice as high losses in land values to residential areas near Dadaepo as a result of the
magnitude and location of the port and processing area. However, the Nakdong alternative, which is by
far the least costly to develop, was ruled out by the MOE so that the marine ecosystem in the lower
reaches of the Nakdong river, which caters to many species of migratory birds, could be preserved. MOE
accepted the alternative referred to as the Cove alternative, located to the South-East of the Nakdong site.
This alternative is, however, far more costly to develop.
B. Appraisal Results
ProWect Costs
4.       Economic project costs were derived from the financial estimates by excluding all taxes, duties
and transfer payments. Economic costs included: (a) construction costs of the wharf, breakwater, terminal
and industrial site (including land reclamation, but excluding plant buildings); (b) operation and
maintenance costs of the port facilities; (c) compensation payments for loss of property and income from
e.g. licenses to fish or harvest seaweed in affected areas, see table 15 for details on the chosen Cove
alternative; and (d) loss in value of those residential properties located near the new port and processing
site, and thus environmentally adversely affected by it. The direct cost difference, including compensation
for loss of fisheries and seaweed income, is estimated to be US$128.9 million in favor of the Nakdong
alternative. However, the anticipated loss of property value due to environmental deterioration from
having the port and industrial processing plants established and working adjacent to established residential
areas, is estimated to revert the overall difference to US$ 7.3 million in favor of the Cove Alternative,
see the table below:

Total                                   781.5                 774.2
5.       Project benefits were based on: (a) inland transport-related savings resulting from a reduction
in the total number of truck- trip kilometers required between the port and the processing plants, reduced
traffic accidents, travel time savings, reduced street maintenance and construction, and reduced air
pollution costs along the streets were truck traffic is reduced; (b) reduction in lighterage activities required
tor loading and unloading vessels (listed as reduced stevedoring costs), and reduced ship waiting time in
port; (c) increased value of inland residential areas from where polluting industries are relocated to the
new port area at Dadaepo; and (d) value of reclaimed land.
6.       The difference in benefits between the chosen Cove alternative and the rejected Nakdong
alternative are due primarily to the fact that a significantly larger piece of land is reclaimed with the
r4akdong alternative than with the chosen Cove site. Thus the Nakdong alternative would have allowed
ha, the relocation of a larger number of processing plants than will be the case with the chosen Cove
alternative. This again explains the difference in the reduction in inland traftic between the two
alternatives, and why more residential inland sites would have benefitted from the Nakdong alternative.
However, the Nakdong alternative was rejected by the MOE in order to avoid the risks of environmental
damage to the fragile protected marine ecosystem at the mouth of the Nakdong river.
7.       It is of interest to observe that whereas overall undiscounted costs were only US$ 7.3 million
lower (see above table) for the Cove alternative, the quantified benefits were as much as US$ 373 million
lower (see table below). The two dominating factors reducing the value of overall Cove-benefits compared
to those of the rejected Nakdong alternative, were US$ 370 million less because less land is reclaimed,
and US$ 219 million less land value appreciation in inland residential areas because fewer timber
processing plants can be relocated.
8.       On the other hand, for reasons of the different relocation configurations of the two alternatives,
and the addition of port facilities for shipments of fish and fisheries products to the Cove alternative, it
will have substantially higher ship related savings than the rejected Nakdong alternative.

Air pollution reduction is measured only as a result of reduced truck traffic along the routes between
the port and the processing plants, whereas the residential land value appreciation is independent of
traffic volumes on these roads, and reflects the mere presence and nearness of noisy and polluting
timber processing plants within 50 meters of residences. This way of measuring environmental
benefits thus avoids the trap of double counting.
9.       If the economic valuation of such environmental impacts as: (a) the loss of environmental
quality of residential areas and recreational land at Dadaepo (valued as loss of real estate value in a
defined residential fringe); (b) the loss of income of fishermen due to planned development (valued as
compensation to be paid); (c) reduced air pollution along the truck roads; (d) reduced traffic accidents;
and (e) improved environment for residential areas around the present timber processing plants that will
he relocated (and replaced with residential or non-polluting commercial development), are included
(however, no residential land value improvements are assumed from the relocation of fish processing
plants, because their pollution impact is experienced as much less severe in the surrounding residential
areas), the net present value of the Cove alternative becomes US$379.4 million, with a benefits-costs ratio
of 1.94. The corresponding economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Cove alternative is 36.3%.
This must be considered a very attractive economic rate of return indeed.
10.      It is of interest to compare the discounted benefits and costs of the rejected Nakdong alternative
and the chosen Cove alternative. The present value (at 12% discount rate) of the project costs are US$
74.3((6 million higher in the chosen Cove alternative, whereas the present value of the Cove alternative
bLilefits are US$ 64.931 million lower than for the rejected Nakdong alternative. In other words, the non-
monceized benefits attributed to retaining an undisturbed marine ecosystem and wetland for birds in the
lower reaches of Nakdong River, amount to no less than US$139.297 million, when discounted at 12%.
II.      Since the costs are high, and the dominating benefit components are rough estimates, and not
entirely uncontroversial, it is of considerable interest to establish the sensitivity of the economic feasibility

indicators of the chosen Cove alternative to changes in some of the key feasibility assumptions. Initially,
conventional engineering sensitivity analyses establishes the robustness of the above base case conclusion:
The EIRR drops marginally to 30.7% if total costs are increased by 15%, to 29.8% if total benefits are
reduced by 15%, and to 24.5% if both cost are increased by 15% and benefits reduced 15%. The
corresponding net present values at 12% discount rate are US$ 398.890 million, US$ 327.745 million,
and US$ 252.333 million, respectively.
12.      Next, return to the base case, and then delete all conventional environmental costs and benefits,
while retaining the real estate value of reclaimed land. This reduces the net present value to US$ 320.560
million, corresponding to a benefit-cost ratio of 1.82, and the EIRR to 31.8%.
13.      Perhaps most interesting among the sensitivity tests is the alternative where conventional
environmental benefits and costs are retained, but where it is assumed either that: (a) the inland
processing plants to be relocated are replaced with other equally polluting industries; or (b) that the
environmental improvements in these established residential areas around the processing plants to be
removed, have zero economic value. In this case (the calculation is the same tor (a) and (b)), the net
present value drops to US$228.384 million, corresponding to a reduction in the benefit-cost ratio to 1 .45,
while the EIRR drops to 23.3%. This suggests that the proposed Cove alternative is economically
attractive and robust as regards the underlying assumptions adopted regarding the valuation of
enivironmental impacts.
14.      Project feasibility hinges critically on one factor; the value of reclaimed land for industrial
relocation purposes at Dadaepo. If this benefit is removed altogether from the base case, the net present
value at 12% discount rate becomes negative at US$25.033 million, corresponding to a benefit-cost ratio
of 0.95, while the EIRR drops to 10.8%, which is slightly below the 12% discount rate required for a
positive ntt present value, i.e. economic feasibility of the project.
15.      In other words, the project's feasibility appears to be robust towards the various downside risks
tor which it has been tested. It should, for example, be noted that no value has been attached to the part
of the reclaimed land being allocated for port operations in the base case, even though it frees up port
areas central Pusan presently used for timber, fish, and fish products for alternative uses. Second, the
residential land value lost from being within 50 meter of timber processing industries has been assumed
to be 17 percentage points off the residential land values more than 50 meters away, based on real estate
,.ransactions in these areas. In the case of the Cove alternative, the relocated industrial plants will be much
further away from the existing residential areas just north of Dadaepo. And yet, the feasibility study
assumes the same relative loss of residential land values north of Dadaepo. The estimated absolute unit
loss figure implies a land value in this area which is almost twice as high as the land value assumed for
the reclaimed land. Local real estate experts claim that this estimated value on the reclaimed land is on
the low side. Third, private industry is clearly interested in buying the reclaimed land for relocating their
processing plants. In other words, at the assumed land values in present and future locations, private
industry see relocation to Dadaepo as an attractive option. In conclusion, since project feasibility is
retained even when the value of this reclaimed land is given close to zero value (while the full costs of
reclaiming it are included in the study), it seems safe to claim that this is an attractive development
project.

BASIC REFERENCE DOCUMENTS USED IN FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Actual and Forecast Income Statements
-   Non-operating income denotes reversal of bad debt allowance and rental from non-operating
assets.
-   Other Non-Operating expenses denotes compensation to civilians, foreign exchange loss
(gain), expenses for school and secondary port operation, and net of miscellaneous income
and expenses.
-   Extraordinary loss (gain) denote loss (gain) from disposal of fixed asset and casual loss.
Current Accounts Schedule
-   Projected accounts receivable = operating revenue * 1.5%.
-   Projected Inventory = (inventory from '89 -'91)1(oper. expenses from '89-'91)
* projected operating expenses.
-   Projected accounts payable & other = (A.P. & other from '89'91)/(C.I.P. from '89-'91)
* projected C.I.P.
-   Accrued liabilities projected growth rate of 4%
Fixed Assets Scheduled
-   Property contributed by private sector is added to fixed assets after 4 years of construction
period.
-   Capital spending to fixed assets is based on the forecast data prepared by KMPA.
-   Construction in progress is assumed to be completed in four years and transferred to fixed
assets at the end of the year.
-   KMPA revaluates fixed assets every five years in accordance with the law on management
of Government owned property. However, model assumes that revaluation of fixed assets
is done annually at a rate of 3 % (85 % of increase in wholesale price) to revaluation surplus.
