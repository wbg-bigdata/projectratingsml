1. Project Context, Development Objectives [or Global Environment Objectives]and
Design


1.1     Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background: According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Ecuador is one
of the 17 "megadiverse" countries in the world. At appraisal, this richness was exemplified by the
density of species estimated to be the highest in the world (9.2 species/1,000 km2, excluding fish)
and degree of endemism thought to be second in the world. In terms of flora diversity, the country
had an estimated 25,000 species of vascular plants or approximately 10% of the world's total.
Ecuador's rich faunal diversity was illustrated by the estimated 800 species of freshwater fish, 450
species of marine fish, 422 species of amphibians (4th in the world), 375 species of reptiles, 333
species of mammals (8th in the world), and 1,618 species of birds (18 % of the world's total). All
this biodiversity was sheltered in a country of 256,370 km2, equivalent to 0.18% of the Earth's
land surface. Agriculture, one of the pillars of Ecuador's economic development and the basis for
food security, and ecotourism, an important source of revenue, depended on this rich biodiversity
resource.

The National System of Protected Areas (NSPA), originated in 1976 with the purpose to support
the conservation of this biodiversity. It was made up of 27 natural areas: 23 continental areas, two
islands and one marine area, covering a land surface area of 4,669,871 ha (approximately 18% of
the national territory) and 14,110,000 ha of marine surface area.

Threats to Biodiversity. Ecuador's ecosystems were fragile and had been exposed to increasing
pressures, due to expansion of agricultural frontier, and natural resources based export production.
The demands for land and natural resources by impoverished groups had contributed to the
degradation of the biodiversity resources of the country. State and private interests in the
exploitation and extraction of natural resources were on a collision course with conservation, and
in many instances the former had prevailed over conservation interests. Activities such as mining,
oil exploitation, major infrastructure works, shrimp farming, fisheries and timber extraction had
all contributed to environmental degradation and represented threats to the protected areas.

Habitat alteration, fragmentation and destruction were caused mainly by deforestation stemming
from the expansion of agriculture and timber exploitation. Between 1950 and 1996, about 58% of
the country's vegetation had already been significantly altered and 95% of the coastal forests had
been cut. On average, 2.3 percent of native forest was lost annually. The high demand for luxury
products such as lobster, sea cucumbers, furs and skins contributes to the overexploitation of flora,
fauna and fisheries. The introduction of exotic species in areas such as the Galapagos island
jeopardized the survival of native species.

Conflicts with landowners and local communities within PAs. Ambiguity in land-holding regimes
and a lack of enforcement of the law within buffer zones was the cause for most of the conflicts
with conservation of land within protected areas.          Absence of strict delimitation of PAs
boundaries had created conflicts from encroachment by illegal settlers. The existing PAs land
tenure status, where 71% (3,300,131 ha) of land belonged to the State and 29% (1,367,295 ha) to
private parties, confirmed the importance of carrying out the full delimitation of PAs. The
existing legal framework did not recognize the existence of private property inside parks and
reserves, however it recognized the ancestral rights of Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian
communities.



                                                 1

Weak Institutional Capacity. Frequent changes within the leadership of the sector had led to
numerous changes in the institutional framework for environmental management. This, and the
limited capacity of the existing institutions, were major constraints to the sustainable management
of biodiversity in Ecuador.

Lack of sustained financing. One of the most critical issues Ecuador faced in the implementation
of PA conservation strategies was the lack of sufficient financial resources. The Ministry of
Environment (Ministerio del Ambiente- MAE) budget was very limited, and largely insufficient
even to cover the most basic recurrent costs; let alone the investments needed to operate the
NSPA at a minimal efficiency level. The revenues generated by the protected areas was going
back to the MAE through a cumbersome bureaucratic process, most of it financed the operation
of all the units within MAE and only a small portion was reinvested directly in the NSPA. Up to
1998, an important share of the tourism revenue from the Galapagos National Park was channeled
to the MAE, thus financing the NSPA and other needs. However, with the promulgation of the
Special Galapagos Law, 95 % of this revenue benefited the Galapagos province, and only 5% was
channeled to MAE. When the project started implementation, a new legal reform eliminated the
5% contribution to MAE, consequently, the NSPA was facing a serious deficit and the mainland
PAs did not receive sufficient financing to ensure their long-term existence.

Rationale for Bank assistance: The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Progress Report for
Ecuador1 alluded to the fact that the Government of Ecuador (GOE) faced serious environmental
issues, and if not tackled, would constrain socially sustainable development in the medium and
long term. The most relevant issues identified by the CAS were biodiversity protection and
deforestation. The project aimed at contributing directly to the CAS goal of protection of
Ecuador's biodiversity through the conservation and management of Ecuador's biodiversity for
socially sustainable development, through implementing key structural and legal reforms that
would set the framework for NSPA participatory management and financial sustainability.

The project would also support this policy objective by: (a) supporting institutional strengthening,
including the Directorate of Biodiversity and Protected Areas (DBPA) and the PA administrations
through improved capacity for Pas management, and the introduction of modern tools for
financial and administrative management; (b) the development of legal and institutional
arrangements to enable participatory management and co-investment processes within PAs,
including concessions of services; (c) the development of innovative financing mechanisms to
help ensure protected areas' sustainability; and (d) the establishment of a Protected Areas Trust
Fund to cover recurrent costs of the NSPA.

In addition, the Bank: (i) had several years of experience in supervising similar projects in
Ecuador; (ii) was supervising other Protected Areas Trust Funds and NSPA projects in the region;
(iii) had the continuity of staff that would ensure that the project builds on past experience; the
Bank's procurement, contracting, disbursement, and disclosure procedures provided a framework
for transparency in project activities and participation of other institutions in the implementation
of the project; (iv) was also well positioned to catalyze additional support over the long term

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) (or Global Environmental
Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators

The project's development objective was to ensure the conservation and management of
Ecuador's biodiversity for socially sustainable development by strengthening the NSPA through
improving the legal, institutional and financial foundations and capacities for the integrated,
participatory management of protected areas.

Key Indicators were:

     Protected Areas Fund supports recurrent costs of at least nine Protected Areas
     NSPA is able to effectively protect ecosystems of global importance for biodiversity
        conservation contained in the two selected protected areas, through the effective
        implementation of management plans
     Local communities within and around the selected Protected Areas are actively involved
        and committed to PAs conservation; through the establishment and operation of the
        Participatory Management Committees
     Directorate of Biodiversity and Protected Areas capable for resource allocation,
        regulating, monitoring and supervising the NSPA
     Non-budget revenues of NSPA increase in a gradual and on permanent basis
     Concessions for services in PAs are fully regulated and piloted in the two selected PAs
     NSPA Strategy updated
     Biodiversity Law approved within the first two years and regulations enforced
     A sound evaluation and monitoring system for the effective management of NSPA is
        functioning in selected PAs.

1.3     Revised PDO [GEO] (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification:

The objective was not revised.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

The beneficiaries of the project included:

     Ecuador. The global benefit of the project would be the improved conservation of the
        country's biodiversity, through the conservation of significant PAs with a rich variety of
        species and significant levels of endemism. The outstanding biodiversity found in the
        selected protected areas provided opportunities to develop self-sustainability social and
        financial strategies, including the establishment of participation mechanisms to support
        protected areas management and development of mechanisms to secure long-term
        financing and generate self-income.

     Ecuadorian society. The project would provide an important benefit to the Ecuadorian
        society as a whole, as it would ensure the sustained conservation of PAs that were an
        integral part of Ecuador's natural and cultural heritage. Most protected areas of the NSPA
        were inhabited by a variety of local and indigenous communities. The Ecuadorian
        Constitution recognized the rights that these populations had to use the natural resources
        within their territories. The GOE's National Biodiversity Strategy was consistent with
        this principle, and proposed actions that were consistent with local communities
        livelihoods, therefore, these communities were key constituencies to ensure PA
        conservation and would be targeted for the potential benefits generated by the NSPA.

     The indigenous and local communities that inhabited PAs had a great cultural heritage,
        were generally well organized, and have developed good experiences in sustainable
        ecosystem management. The interest of the GOE to integrate these populations in the
        management of PAs would be clearly reflected in their direct participation in the PA
        Management Committees.

     Local governments such as municipalities and provincial governments would be
        integrated to the PAs management as strategic partners as their jurisdiction overlapped
        with PAs or their buffer zones. They would also actively participate as members of the
        Management Committees. Local governments would benefit, especially in terms of
        additional revenue from tourism and concession fees.

     The private sector - enterprises and businesses especially of the tourism sector that
        operate or were seeking to operate within the PAs, would become key partners in
        developing the concessions for services initiatives.

     The MAE, specifically the DBPA personnel would be targeted for institutional
        strengthening and training to more efficiently manage and monitor the PAs.

1.5     Original Components

The project consisted of four components as follows:

Component 1: Institutional Strengthening and Legal Development (Total Cost: US$ 6.2 M,
GEF financing: US $0.7 M )

This component aimed to consolidate DBAP's role as the responsible agency for the
administration of the NSPA, by strengthening its planning, control and monitoring capacities to
ensure effective management of PAs. It would also develop the regulatory framework to promote
participatory management and co-management of PAs in the country. The implementation of this
component would articulate the long-term strategy for protected area management with the
national policies and strategies for sustainable development and biodiversity conservation in
Ecuador.

Component 2: Participatory management of Priority Protected Areas (Total cost: US$17.65
M, GEF financing: US$1.6 M)

This component aimed to promote the participatory management of two priority PAs (Cotacachi-
Cayapas Ecological Reserve and Machalilla National Park) by developing participatory models
according to the specific social and political conditions of each area. For this purpose, the project



                                                 4

would support the creation and strengthening of local participatory management committees to
facilitate the integration of different stakeholders in the management of PAs. In addition, the
project would finance the updating and/or preparation of management plans and the
implementation of priority activities, as well as the recurrent costs of the Machalilla National
Park, Cotacahi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve and the Cuyabeno Wildlife Production Reserve
during the first year of the project until the Protected Areas Trustt Fund (PAF) would generate
revenues. These priority areas were selected by doing a comparative analysis, using biological,
economic and social criteria.

Component 3: Sustainable Financing (Total cost: US $ 11.44 M; GEF Financing: US $ 4.3 M)

This component was directed to achieve the consolidation of the PAF, that operated within the
National Environmental Fund (Fondo Ambiental Nacional - FAN) of Ecuador. PAF was a
strategic response to a lack of a long term funding mechanism to support conservation within the
National Patrimony of Protected Areas. Furthermore, once essential recurrent costs of PAs have
been covered, any additional resources could then be targeted to more direct support of
biodiversity conservation at PAs.

Component 4: Project Monitoring and Evaluation (Total cost: US$ 1.4 M; GEF financing:
US$ 1.4 M)

This component aimed to ensure the proper operation of the project, through the establishment of
a follow-up system to evaluate and monitor the implementation of planned activities at the
administrative and technical levels. This system included the following aspects: (i) Protected
Areas Information System; (ii) Management Efficiency Monitoring; (iii) Biodiversity
Monitoring; and (iv) Monitoring of Project Activities.

1.6      Revised Components:

The components were not revised over the implementation period.

1.7      Other significant changes

There were no changes in the project's design, scope, and scale. However, there were changes in
the project's schedule, funding allocations, and implementation arrangements as mentioned below.
In addition, there were also amendments to the Grant Agreement.

Project Schedule. The closing date of the project was extended once by six months from June 30,
2007 to December 31, 2007 in order to: (i) follow-up on critical issues such as the
implementation of the Strategic Plan; (ii) improve management of the selected PAs; and (iii)
achieve the project's key performance indicators and objectives.

Funding Reallocations. During implementation, the Grant funds were reallocated twice among
expenditure categories, as shown in the Table below:

The first reallocation, in July 2006, aimed to allow additional investments under the Civil Works
and Goods categories to secure improved management and services to increase revenues at the
two selected protected areas. This was expected to optimize the preparation of key planning tools
and overall policy and legal framework, namely, the consultation process of the Protected Areas
Strategic Plan and the completion of the legal framework for the concessions of services. The
second reallocation, in January 2007, aimed to substantially contribute to the improved
management of the selected protected areas and the full achievement of the project's key
performance indicators and global objective.

Implementation arrangements. During the preparation phase, the Minister of Environment had
indicated that the Grant No. TF051537 was going to be administered by the Project Coordination
Unit-(PCU) within the MAE2. This unit was established to administer all the international
cooperation projects.       However, the Financial Management and Procurement Capacity
Assessments carried out by the Bank concluded that the PCU did not have all the conditions
required by the Bank to carry out the overall administration of funds. An action plan was
prepared for the PCU to fulfill all the steps necessary to meet the Bank's requirement. In the
interim, the Bank and the MAE agreed to enter into a temporary agreement with FAN as the
administrator of funds to execute Components 1, 2 and 4, until the PCU-MAE completed the
action plan and was re-assessed by the Bank. After the PCU complied with the Bank's Financial
Management and Procurement Capacity requirements, the administration of funds was transferred
from FAN to the PCU in January 2006.

Amendment to the Grant Agreement. Before the effectiveness of the project, the GOE had
indicated to the Bank that it was not possible to commit to the approval of the Biodiversity Law
given that this decision depended on Congress approval. Therefore, upon the Government's
request, the sections in Article V of the Grant Agreement referring to the approval of the Law
within two years of project implementation were eliminated through the first amendment dated




2This PCU corresponds to an administrative unit within MAE responsible for the administration of all the
international cooperation projects, it does not refer to a project implementation unit. The project was
implemented by a technical team leaded by a Coordinator.

         December 2, 2003 . The corresponding performance indicator was also eliminated from the
         Supplemental Letter.

         2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

         2.1     Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

         During preparation, the project design took into account lessons learned from the First GEF
         Biodiversity Protection Project. Likewise, the design considered the risk factors and appropriate
         measures were adopted to mitigate all major risks identified at appraisal. The project also
         provided a participatory framework involving stakeholders and direct beneficiaries in the
         decision-making processes

         Lessons of earlier operation and reflected in the project design:

              Community Involvement. Involvement of communities in the planning and
                 implementation of sustainable resource management and biodiversity protection is
                 important for the harmonious development of strategic management plans for PAs.

              NGO Collaboration. Collaboration between public sector authorities, NGOs and bilateral
                 cooperation organizations is essential for project implementation.

              Project Focus: Impacts of project actions are higher when focusing on limited and
                 targeted objectives than supporting many scattered activities.

              Institutional Sustainability: Greater involvement of civil society in park management
                 contributes to long-term PAs viability and social and institutional sustainability.

                 Financial Sustainability: It is necessary to implement a financing strategy to cover basic
                 recurrent costs of the PAs to ensure the long-term operation and maintenance of such
                 goods and infrastructure and the basic operation of the PAs.

         Risks and Risk Mitigation Measures. The Table below shows the risks and mitigation measures
         identified in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) along with a brief commentary on how the
         risks evolved during implementation.

          Adequacy of participatory processes. During the preparation phase of the project, the MAE was
          particularly careful in enabling a broad participation by diverse stakeholders in Protected Area
          management. The participatory scheme included active consultation and consensus building
          among diverse sectors involved in PA management (governmental, non-governmental, private,
          community, international cooperation). It also provided a solid basis for the implementation phase,
          as representatives of these sector became strategic partners in the next four years.

          Following the recommendations of the workshop on Protected Area Financing Mechanisms,
          sponsored by the Bank in June 2000, the MAE established a Project Design Advisory Committee.

This multi-disciplinary ad hoc working group was made up of experts who carried out activities
in diverse protected areas in different regions of Ecuador and belonged to organizations with
experience in park and reserve management. It was created specifically to guide and accompany
the project design process. In addition, several workshops and informative meeting took place
with representatives of International Cooperation Agencies in order to exchange ideas, receive
comments and propose mechanisms of direct cooperation with the MAE and specifically with the
project.

2.2      Implementation

The project was not restructured, and no changes were made to the project design. The project
was at `Risk' status until 2004 because of: (i) late effectiveness; and (ii) delayed implementation
for the reasons mentioned below, and the resulting low disbursement. The Bank conducted a
Midterm Review (MTR) in May 2006, and assessed progress to date on all project components,
the implementation issues and the actions to be taken to ensure the successful completion of the
project.

The following factors affected project implementation:

Factors outside government control or implementation agency

None

Factors subject to government control or implementation agency

(i) The project was declared effective in December 2003, one year after it was approved by the
Board in November 2002. The main reason for the delay was the disagreement of the GOE on the
wording of sections 5.0.1. (a) and (d) of the Grant Agreement, that referred to the approval of the
Biodiversity Law within two years of project implementation and the Suspension of the Grant by
the Bank if any future provisions regarding the country's protected areas legal framework was
inconsistent with the project objectives. The Government argued that it was not possible to
commit the approval of a Law given that this action relied on the Congress and that the language
of those clauses was inconsistent with the sovereign right of a country to establish its own legal
framework. In order to overcome this problem and obtain the ratification as soon as possible, the
Government and the Bank agreed to amend the Grant Agreement. This amendment consisted of
removing sections 5.0.1. (a) and (d) from Article V (Remedies of the Bank) and adding new text
to Section 3.0.1. a)-Article III (Execution of the Project), to ensure that the GOE would provide
an adequate environmental legal framework for the implementation of the project. Through this
amendment, the obligation of the GOE to provide an adequate environmental framework for the
implementation of the project remained as originally committed.

(ii) Political instability which prevailed in the country during the life of the project created a
difficult environment for implementation. For example, since the project preparation started in
2001 Ecuador had seven Minister of Environment, and during the four years of implementation
itself, the Minister had changed four times. In addition, the Ministry personnel also changed
frequently which created instability and lack of continuity in implementation.

(iii) Implementation of the Components 1,2, and 4 under the agreement with the GOE was
extremely slow in the first year after the project became effective (December             2003 to
November 2004). The slow pace of implementation during this period was due to:                  (a)



                                                10

unsatisfactory performance of the project's technical team; and (b) vacant position of Legal
Specialist, Financial Strategy/PI Specialist, and Social Specialist for a lengthy period of time
after the MAE decided to put in place a new project team.

(iv) Three main procurement issues affected project implementation:

         (a) Unclear organizational arrangements. Regarding the organizational arrangements,
initially the project procurement was implemented jointly by the FAN and the MAE. Under this
arrangement, procurement progress was very limited because of lack of clear definition of
responsibilities among the different actors: the FAN, technical staff of the MAE and project's
technical team. Over the second year, coordination among parties as well as procurement tasks
improved. Finally and as originally planned, procurement and financial management
responsibilities were transferred to PCU-MAE as explained before. This new organization also
presented some coordination difficulties at the initial stage of administration derived from the fact
that PCU-MAE wanted to apply its internal procedures and failed to understand that the project
was ruled by the World Bank's procedures and the project's Operational Manual. Once PCU-
MAE was clear on its role, project administrative arrangements started to operate more efficiently.

         (b) High turnover of staff in the PCU-MAE. The key staff in the PCU-MAE was changed
frequently and the review or signing of procurement documents by this unit suffered substantial
delays until the recruitment of a new staff familiar with the Bank's procedures.

         (c) Delays in payments to the contractors in the later part of the project. Payments to the
contractors towards the closing period of the project had been stopped because the PCU-MAE
was not able to provide the Ministry of Finance with all the financial information it required. In
addition, the new Governmental Accounting System started operating, comprising a temporary
interruption of transactions under project and counterpart accounts.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E Design. Key Performance Indicators, Outcome/Impact Indicators, and Output Indicators
were developed at Appraisal to monitor the performance of the project towards meeting the
planned activities and the project global objective. Two additional aspects were part of the
project's monitoring design: effectiveness of individual protected areas and status of biodiversity
at selected protected areas. Overall the project provided the MAE with adequate tools, methods
and capacity for collecting and analyzing data during the implementation period.

M&E Implementation and Utilization. The project was monitored at the three levels as
explained below:

(i) Monitoring of Project Activities

A monitoring system to assess the progress on project's components and activities was installed
at the start-up phase of the project. The assessments were developed based on the outcome
indicators agreed during Appraisal. To complete this level of monitoring, the system included the
project's planning instruments such as the annual operations plan and the weekly work plans,
both of which ensured a measurement of the advances of the actions contemplated in the project.
By monitoring the project activities, the continued supervision permitted timely decision making
on the basis of the project objectives and the mentioned planning instruments.




                                                 11

(ii) Progress Reporting at Individual Protected Areas

The MAE applied the World Bank/WWF Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool3 twice
during the life of the project at the two priority protected areas (Machalilla and Cotacachi-
Cayapas). This tool forms part of a series of management effectiveness assessment tools, which
range from the WWF Rapid Assessment and Prioritization Methodology used to identify key
protected areas at threat within a protected area system.4

At the project level, the process started with the development of baseline information and the
adjustment of the methodology to the local context. The information was collected directly by
protected staff through the analysis of secondary information and verifications at the field. The
final allocation of scores to the different evaluation parameters was carried out through specific
workshops, participants included MAE authorities, personnel of the PAs, and local actors. In the
particular case of Component 3 (Sustainable Financing), data was collected from FAN's officers,
reports from Asset Managers and Financial Advisors based on the following indicators: (i) returns
on the investment of endowment funds; (ii) % of funding for NSPA from FAP; and (iii)
percentage of funding for NSPA from the GOE.

The reports produced so far have allowed the understanding of the status of the main management
aspects and to take management decisions on a well informed, quick and efficient manner.

(iii) Biodiversity Monitoring.

This monitoring system focuses on assessing the status of biodiversity, although baseline
information was developed during the project's preparation phase (as basis to select the priority
protected areas), it was updated as initial information for the system. The update consisted of
selecting key biodiversity elements ("species") as to secure a continued monitoring effort. The
project team initially developed the biodiversity monitoring system at the two priority PAs
selected for the Project, however upon request of the MAE and given the usefulness of this tool, it
was extended to the other seven protected areas.

This system comprises three basic elements: a series of practical and user-friendly forms
developed for data collection at the field, a database to process the information and a GIS



3 The purpose of this tool is to help track and monitor progress in the achievement of the World
Bank/WWF Alliance worldwide protected area management effectiveness target. It is aimed to help
reporting progress on management effectiveness, it has been developed to provide a quick overview of
progress in improving the effectiveness of management in individual protected areas. It can be completed
by protected area staff or project staff, with input from other protected area staff. It has been designed to be
easily answered by those managing the protected area without any additional research. The main part of the
assessment comprises a set of questions related to overall management parameters that can be answered by
assigning a simple score ranging between 0 (poor) to 3 (excellent).

platform to generate reports and maps for decision making. The data collection forms were
prepared to allow field staff to easily collect information and make the initial processing at the
protected areas. The whole process was accompanied by specific training to the MAE's staff at
the field and central unit and the installation of specialized software and hardware, both at the
protected areas and central unit in Quito.

Due to the short implementation period, it was not possible to actually assess the impacts of the
project's actions on the status of biodiversity at the selected protected areas, however it was
possible to pilot the system in at least nine protected areas and confirm that it was operating with
very good results as expressed by the system users during the evaluation workshops and regular
project missions. The long-term operation of the system is secured by three main aspects: i) the
system operates autonomously, since it is not dependent on a central information system to
process and generate information; ii) users are very well trained and capable of operating without
permanent technical assistance from external persons/entities and iii) the continuous demand for
information service by local agencies and international donors will also generate a continued and
efficient operation.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary

There were no significant deviations or waivers from the Bank safeguards and fiduciary policies
and procedures during the implementation of the project. On the contrary, both the environmental
and social safeguards were observed as described in the PAD. Compliance with safeguard
policies were assessed during the supervision missions.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

(a)      Transition arrangements.

Institutional. MAE is currently planning to create an Environmental Superintendency which would
take over many of the functions of MAE, and MAE would become more of a technical entity. In
terms of PAs, the government is planning to make changes to have more effective management in
the field. For example, regional offices would be strengthened in PA management in the field and
they would be made in charge of PAs, responsible for resource allocation and monitoring the status
of biodiversity. The transition process will be strongly supported by the managerial and
administrative tools developed under the project.

Financial/ Budget provision. FAN will continue financing PA management with its capitalized
funds and is expected to increase the revenue to $35 million to cover all 36 PAs by 2011.
Thereafter, all the PAs are likely to receive $45,000 to $55,000 per year. The mechanisms to
generate self income developed under the project, namely, concessions for services and tariffs for
telecommunications infrastructure will complement FAN's efforts.           The second consists of
charging a tariff to telecommunication companies for the use of infrastructural facilities for the
operation of radio, television, and mobile phones located inside the protected areas. The Ministry
of Economy has committed to complement and cover basic recurrent costs.

The project has also complemented the efforts of FAN in the preparation of Financial Strategy for
NSPA. This strategy includes:

     Putting in place legal framework so that all revenues generated by PA will stay in PA
         itself. The legal framework consisting of a specific regulation stemming from the



                                                  13

        Environmental Management Law to establish the procedures to allocate such funds at the
        protected areas level has been prepared and it is expected to be approved by July 2008.
     Increasing the entrance fee for tourists after improving the infrastructure services in all the
        PAs.
     Revision and implementation of the fundraising strategy to secure the future capitalization
        of the PAF.

Technical/staffing: Because of the government freeze on recruitment, the MAE is faced with the
problem of having limited staffing, especially on technical aspects, and also in the field. PAF is
providing resources to allow MAE to hire staff from local communities for surveillance system and
park rangers. As the technical staff cannot be hired using FAN resources, the MAE needs to find
ways to hire the required staff for monitoring and biodiversity activities, and social specialists to
deal with local social issues.

Policies. Financial Strategy, which is part of the Strategic Plan, was approved in November 2007.
This is the official plan of the government for managing National Patrimony of PAs. For further
details see Section 3.2.

Marketing. Concession for tourism is envisioned as a means of financing for PA management,
and also for generating additional revenue for Ecuador. The project helped to develop the
mechanisms for concessions for tourism services in two protected areas, although the legal
analysis to support the process to end up with concessions contracts between the MAE and third
parties (private sector, local governments and others) took longer than expected, the GOE has
now the mechanism fully developed to expand this initiative to other protected areas with a high
potential of increasing revenues to be re-invested in their improved management.

(b) Use of performance indicators. The key indicators which were used during implementation
will continue to be used as part of the MAE's regular operations for monitoring and evaluation.
However, these indicators are scheduled to be updated by September/October 2008, provided the
MAE gets funding from the Government of Germany.

(c) Follow-up project. MAE and Fan are taking the necessary actions to process a new GEF
operation using UNDP as the implementing agency to fully implement the Financial Strategy
developed under the project and hopefully to reach $35 million capitalization target by 2011 to
cover the basic recurrent costs of 36 Pas currently comprising the State Patrimony.

(d) Suggested priority and optimum timing of any future impact evaluation. An independent
external evaluation by a panel of auditors to evaluate the project's outcome is scheduled to be
conducted in February/March 2009.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objective of the project is still important to the country's social and environmental
development. It is also timely and appropriate to the needs of Ecuador. The project is consistent
with the Bank's current CAS for Ecuador (Report No. 25817 EC, dated April 29, 2003),
according to which the Bank will continue to play an important role in overseeing GEF-funded
projects. The project activities have significantly strengthened the capacity of the MAE to
administer the State protected areas. Two priority protected areas have fully developed overall



                                                 14

management, administrative and biodiversity monitoring tools, as well as participatory
mechanisms and have become models to be replicated in the rest of the country. Eleven protected
areas have their basic recurrent costs covered on a long term basis, providing the basic tool to
develop additional financing mechanisms. Nine protected areas are capable of resource allocation
and efficient financial and administrative management. These results provide the foundations to
consolidate the NSPA and secure the sustainable use of natural resources as envisioned under the
National Development Plan developed by the current administration.

Achievement of Project Development Objectives [or Global Environmental
Objectives]

Satisfactory. The project was successful in achieving its GEO. The following achievements
demonstrate the direct correlation between the project's outputs and their resulting outcomes. For
example, the project activities had significantly strengthened the capacity of the MAE to
administer the State's protected areas. Two priority protected areas have fully developed overall
management, administrative and biodiversity monitoring tools, as well as participatory
mechanisms and have become models to be replicated in the rest of the country. 11 PAs have
their basic recurrent costs covered on a long term basis, providing the basic tool to develop
additional financing mechanisms. Nine PAs are capable of resource allocation and efficient
financial and administrative management.

The details of the project's major outcomes and achievements are as follows:

A. Improving the legal, institutional and financial foundations of NSPA.

The project was successful in building the capacity of the MAE to efficiently manage the NSPA
through the design and operation of modern tools for financial and administrative management,
the development of legal and institutional arrangements to enable participatory management
within protected areas and the development of innovative financing mechanisms to help ensure
protected areas' financial sustainability.

a) Legal

For the reasons explained previously in the document, the section in the Grant Agreement
referred to the approval of the Biodiversity Law5 was eliminated prior to effectiveness and
therefore one of the project's key performance indicators was eliminated. The main concern
resulting from this action was the potential risk to achieve the improved management of the PAs.

The project team proposed an alternative to strengthen the management of protected areas
without having the Law approved.           This was the development of an internal regulation
(Ministerial Decree) stemming from the Environmental Management Law, that provided the legal



5In 2001, the draft Law went through the first debate at the National Congress. The National
Congress at that moment considered holding a second and definitive debate on it. The reason that
stopped the Congress to hold the definite debate was the adverse social and political context
existing at that moment; the draft Law was perceived by key sector of civil society as an
instrument imposed by the international cooperation.




                                                  16

basis for the operation of the NSPA. This regulation was approved in July 2006. Further, specific
regulations were developed in articulation to this one to allow the operation of the following key
aspects: : i) concessions for services for two protected areas holding tourist facilities; ii)
participatory management committees; iii) co-management agreements in Machalilla and
Cotacachi-Cayapas, iv) municipal, provincial, community and private protected areas; v) re-
investment in protected areas of all revenues generated by them..

The legal assessment to establish the procedures for concession of tourism services took longer
than expected, not allowing the piloting of such concessions in two protected areas as originally
planned. However, private tourism operations at the community and national level have expressed
its interest in holding the administration of tourism facilities in both protected areas.

The regulations developed under the project have provided a frame to move towards an improved
an integrated management of PAs and buffer zones, and they have become a practical solution to
high priority aspects. The above listed legal instruments, except for one, are approved and being
implemented. Moreover, the GOE is also planning to continue seeking the approval of the Law.

b) Institutional

(i) The Protected Areas Strategic Plan has been updated according to the new management tools
and approved. The Plan includes crucial aspects such as: (i) strengthening of the administration of
the NSPA; (ii) implementing new regulations and programs that increase the capacity for
protected areas management by the private and public sectors in Ecuador (some of them already
developed under the project); (iii) increasing the public support for protected areas by
strengthening government and non-government communication/environmental education
programs at the local, regional and national level; (iv) implementing protected areas management
plans; (v) establishing a long-term financial mechanisms for protected areas management; (vi)
strengthening mechanisms for the participation of communities, NGOs and private sector in the
administration of the NSPA.

(ii) The financial and managerial system for the DBPA is fully operational in nine protected areas

(iii) Management Plans have been completed and priority activities are under implementation, in
order to effectively protect ecosystems of global importance contained in two selected protected
areas

(iv) Biodiversity Monitoring system is fully operational in nine priority protected areas

(v) NSPA Information System has been developed, equipment and databases are in operation, and
training of key staff has been completed

c) Financial.

The outcomes for this project in its Component 3 were: (i) capitalization of the Protected Areas
Fund (PAF) to $12 million before 2006; ii) Capitalization goal has been surpassed (US 13.5
million) by the end of the project, and (iii) that PAF supports about 24% of the basic recurrent
costs of the NSPA.

The initial $8 million seed capital of the PAF was established with following contributions: GEF:
$4 million; KFW-Germany: $3 million and GoE: $1 million. A second debt for nature swap
between Ecuador and Germany negotiated between 2005 and 2006 allowed FAP to reach a US


                                                  17

$ 12.3 million capital, surpassing the $12 million target committed under the project. A third debt
swap with Germany that took place by the end of 2007, has increased the capital to US$ 13.5
million. As result of the successful implementation of the fundraising strategy, the project
surpassed the 14% target of funding to basic recurrent costs by reaching about 24%.

FAN effectively managed its investment portfolio to assure an adequate rate of return from
investments (in Ecuador and abroad) to maximize the amounts for the protected areas, and also
ensured that the endowment funds were protected to preserve the original contributions for the
endowment. The average return for the GEF Grant of the last three years was 6.89% and the
average return of the entire portfolio (GEF grant plus debt for nature swaps plus contribution of
the Republic of Ecuador) was 7.2% after meeting all costs from Asset Managers and Investment
Advisors. This level of management capabilities from FAN has provided $2.3 million to the
NSPA through PAF during the period 2003-2008.

Further, between 2003-2008 not only $2.3 million of new funding was made possible for NSPA
but all the principal of the endowment never went below the original grant amount. Instead,
through re-capitalization of funds not allocated to protected areas the total endowment was
increased by more than $500,000.

The implementation of the project has facilitated FAN to consolidate its base for its PA Trust
Fund activities. There is evidence of a convergence of national public actors, including the MAE,
Ministry of Economy and Finances, The Ecuadorian Agency for International Cooperation
(AGECI), and the National Secretariat for Planning and Development (SENPLADES) and
international ones, including the German Government, private NGOs such as Conservation
International (CI) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC). These actors also support the concept of
a financial mechanism that complements the contributions of the Ecuadorian state or favors
NSPA. Additional alliances within the national productive private sector (Consorcio OCP-
EnCana and EcoFondo) as well as the outside institutional private sector (Mac Arthur and Moore)
also support the FAN's activities by providing financial support toward environmental
management and the sustainable development of Ecuador.

Effective and efficient implementation of PAF by FAN has also generated interest in many
organizations to be part of this effort. FAN's management capacities met stakeholders
expectations and this confidence in the organization has generated more interest and commitment.

B. Improving the capacity of NSPA for the integrated, participatory management of protected
areas and Public Involvement


The project has taken into consideration the experience and knowledge of the local communities
as well as that of Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and the public sector when designing
and implementing the project's activities. During the implementation, skills, experiences, and
knowledge of these local communities became especially relevant to social participation. The
NGOs provided important insight about managing protected areas while the private sector shared
its knowledge of financial sustainability.

The project supported the creation and strengthening of local Participatory Management
Committees (PMC) to facilitate the integration of different stakeholders in the management of
PAs. National and local authorities have fully endorsed the establishment and operation of the
PMCs. National authorities have supported PMCs directly through its regulation and capacity
building, while local authorities are active members of PMCs. The committees also provided a



                                                18

participatory space through a constant dialogue in the processes of planning, executing,
supervising, and evaluating the project's actions in each of the selected PAs.

Many strategic partnerships were formed with NGOs, international agencies, programs, and
consultant agencies that have assisted in an effective and voluntary manner in the distinct stages
of project development. These partnerships have contributed to the coordination of strengths,
means, exchange of information, and necessary resources to carry from start to finish the specific
activities that will allow all stakeholders to reach common goals.

a) Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve.

The project fully supported the preparation of the management plan, which became an instrument
to identify the priority programs and actions, as well as the administrative mechanisms to
implement an effective management in this PA. To ensure public participation during the
management plan's design, several workshops were organized with different stakeholders related
to this PA, including the local communities that live inside or around the area, and the productive
sectors (i.e., tourism, forestry, mining, and agricultural) which use the natural resources of the
area and its buffer zone.

The project also helped to create and strengthen the PMC to enhance coordination and
communication among different stakeholders related to the PA management. A total of seven
committees were established in this Reserve.

The Cuicocha's Environmental Interpretation Center, located in the upper zone of the Reserve,
was remodeled and an intensive environmental education and interpretation program was
developed to communicate the ecological and cultural importance of this reserve and the NSPA.
Interpretation trails around the Cuicocha lagoon were given maintenance and new ones were
constructed.

The project also strengthened the technical and logistical capacity of the reserve's staff for
implementing and effective control and patrolling program, through hiring community park
rangers (through PAF) and financing basic patrolling equipment (field equipment, uniforms,
motorcycles, vehicle, and canoes).


The project financed training programs to community members on micro-projects on gardening
and medicinal plants, and as a result, they are now capable of taking care of these micro-
enterprises. The project, however, did not finance micro-enterprises due to shortage of time.

b) Machalilla National Park.

The project provided financial and technical assistance for the preparation of the Park큦
Managerial Plan, which stemmed from the Management Plan prepared under the first protected
areas project and identified the priority programs and actions, as well as the administrative
mechanisms to implement an effective management in this PA. This process was also carried out
with the participation of all stakeholders, including the local communities that live inside or
around the area, and the productive sectors (i.e. tourism, fishing, and agricultural) which use the
natural resources of the area and its buffer zone.

The implementation of the Managerial Plan consisted of strengthening the technical and
operational capacities of the field staff (training program described above), the improved
protection of land and marine biodiversity and cultural resources, environmental and social
research and monitoring, control and patrolling, education and public awareness, and promotion


                                                   19

of tourism and recreation in the PA. Park infrastructure (ranger stations and minor tourism
facilities) was upgraded and basic equipment, (field equipment, Global Positioning System (GPS),
radios, computers, motorcycles, navigation and communication equipment) was provided.

The project also created and strengthened the PMC to enhance coordination and communication
among different stakeholders related to the PA management.

C. Cost-Effectiveness

As mentioned before, the project was behind schedule for almost two years because the
institutional environment was not favorable for its implementation. Such context forced the
project team to seek innovative and cost-effective approaches to secure the achievement of the
global objective in a reduced time frame. The project planned for the activities to be carried out in
shorter time periods that nevertheless permit effective execution and still provided evidence of
the expected results.

The project team used the most cost-effective means to execute the project's activities. For
example, the project considered the experiences of similar projects to assess its actions. The
management plans were the least-cost ones as compared to others developed before and they have
fully satisfied the necessary technical and planning tools requirements. The preparation of the
NSPA Financial Strategy is another example of cost-effectiveness. The project took advantage of
the ongoing initiative comprising the expertise of several national and international NGOs to put
together experiences, carry out coordinated analysis and leverage resources.

It is worth highlighting that various products and results obtained through the project will serve as
a baseline not only for the work developed by the MAE, but also for the stakeholders who are
actively accompanying the actions being executed in the project.

Finally, establishing a basic work team that provided efficient support in the distinct actions that a
project should undertake helped to obtain the expected results. The fact that the project managed
to insert itself within the MAE's central unit and not just be an executing unit, permitted the
advance of the project and the full involvement of the MAE's functionaries.

D. Financial Leverage

Due to the project dynamics, it was possible to leverage funds from NGOs such as CI, TNC, and
Ecociencia to develop various studies such as "The Identification of Conservation Spaces and
Priorities in the Marine Area," which have been sufficiently important to be taken into
consideration in the integrated ecosystem management component of the Strategic Plan of the
NSPA. The total contribution to develop these activities was $88,350 ($30,350 from CI; $48,000
from TNC, and $10,000 from Ecociencia).

As mentioned under the cost-effectiveness section, another activity that has received technical
and financial support was the development of a financial sustainability strategy, which
contemplated the identification of different viable financial alternatives inside the NSPA. The
contribution of CI to develop this activity was $60,997. Other contributions included $135,000
from TNC, $5,000 from Ecociencia, and $15,000 from Mentefactura.

It was also possible to leverage funds from several NGOs to prepare the Management Plan of the
Cotacachi-Cayapas Reserve for an amount of $40,563. An additional contribution of $5,000 in



                                                20

technical assistance allowed the development of a regulation for the co-management of PAs. The
project's training program received additional funds from CI ($20,000) and TNC ($32,000).

The MAE's Green Area Program contributed $10,000 towards the elaboration of the business
plan for the El Boliche National Recreational Area, which was necessary to later develop the
financial sustainability strategy and to facilitate the process of designing the concession
mechanism for tourist infrastructure.

In relation to the activities implemented by FAN, the MacArthur Foundation contributed
$150,000 to apply the management effectiveness tool at the Condor Kutuku Conservation
Corridor. An additional contribution of this Foundation (US $ 125,00) supported the updating of
the fundraising strategy to secure additional resources to FAN, including the capitalization of
PAF. TNC committed an initial contribution of $30,000 to support the implementation of the
PAF's fundraising strategy and to improve the overall management capabilities by FAN. Finally,
the Moore Foundation provided a US $ 1.5 million grant to FAN to support the management of
the Podocarpus and Yasun National Parks.

E. Replication Approach

The project has broadly disseminated its experiences in terms of planning, monitoring and
financial tools and mechanisms for analysis and discussion through various documents, capacity
building events at a local level, and information exchange with actors involved in the project.
Among the functionaries at the MAE (at both the central and PAs levels), the transfer of
knowledge took place through the elaboration of operational manuals, preparation of different
events, and strategic analysis, among other means. The main purpose of such dissemination
approach has been to motivate different actors to expand and upscale such initiatives, ideally to
cover as much national protected areas as possible and even pilot such experiences at municipal
and private protected areas.

The immediate replication actions after the project closing will be the installation of the financial-
administrative system to cover at least 50% of the national PAs and the incorporation of at least
10 more PAs to the biodiversity monitoring system. The Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) replicated both, the biodiversity monitoring and financial systems under its BID-
AMAZNOR Project (one of the project's co-financier), in the Cuyabeno Reserve and two other
Reserves supported by its operation, to secure a standardized methodology.

With regard to the PA Trust Fund under Component 3, not only the design and implementation of
the fund but also its institutionalization has led to the design of other funds such as the PA Trust
Fund in Colombia and to create a PA Trust Fund in the Dutch Antilles in the Caribbean. Lessons
learned and best practices have been broadly disseminated through the Latin America and the
Caribbean Network of Environmental Funds-REDLAC.

3.3      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the discussion given in Sections 3.2, the overall outcome is rated as Satisfactory.

3.4      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)       Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts. The project did not have any direct impacts on poverty alleviation. However it
helped to create local capacity at the level of the PMCs for improved natural resources
management.

Gender Aspects: The project contributed in empowering women in taking decisions. They are
now actively participating in PMCs and in working groups and playing important roles in
decision making process. Further, there is a good gender balance in all the committees.

Social Development: The project created a positive impact on the stakeholders in realizing their
roles and the importance of their participation and involvement in the committees. The project
also supported the capacity building of local people to develop more practical or operational ways
to address conservation issues within their respective regions, especially in terms of finding
alternative ways of livelihood activities.

(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project has developed adequate mechanisms and institutional arrangements to facilitate the
participation of local stakeholders in protected areas in the planning, funding and execution of
protected area management projects, thus contributing to enforce the government's new policies
on biodiversity conservation.


FAN has built capabilities for fund raising and administration, and for the transfer of financial
resources to support the activities of the government, private sector and NGOs for the protection,
conservation, and sustainable use of Ecuador natural resources. FAN has ensured the necessary
stability and accountability in the management of economic sources over the long term, based on
the national conservation and environmental management goals and priorities. For further details
see Section 3.2.



(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

Positive

     Ambiguity in land-holding regimes and lack of enforcement of the law had caused
         conflicts with conservation of land within PAs. Because of the project, local communities,
         particularly at the Cotacachi-Cayapas Reserve have become willing to negotiate with
         neighbors and overcome their long-term disputes. Even more, upon the local
         communities request, the main activity financed at the Reserve under the project's




                                                22

         participatory strategy was the delimitation of an important portion of the Reserve, where
         land tenure was becoming a serious conflict among these communities.
     Instead of the planned nine PAs, by the close of the project, PAF was in a position to
         cover basic recurrent costs of 11 PAs. This was made possible because, FAN's
         capitalization goal was surpassed by the end of the project ($13.5 million).
     During the implementation of PAF, other sources of funding were secured to develop a
         monitoring and evaluation tool for PAF, which was developed together with the MAE.
     FAN's capabilities to manage endowment funds also generated interest of other donors
         and currently FAN will manage the Invasive Species Fund for Galapagos, the
         ProCuencas Podocarpus Fund, the Gran Reserva Chachi Fund, and the Bosque Protector
         Chongon Colonche Fund. Without the project, FAN would not have developed those
         skills that are being transferred to other initiatives as the ones described above.
     Strong support of PMCs to the participation of youth and in turn, dedicated involvement
         of youth in the Management Plans were unexpected and positive outcomes of the project.

Negative. There was no unexpected negative impact of the project.

3.6      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

The following are the most significant conclusions and recommendations of the final Beneficiary
Assessment conducted at project closing:

It has been shown that the project fulfilled the goals and commitments that were undertaken.
According to the performance indicators of the PAD, the project in some cases has exceeded the
expectations and expected results.

The following products could be considered extra contributions of the project, and should be
highlighted to give recognition to the efficiency of the persons responsible: i) SNAP Financial
Sustainability Strategy, Economic Evaluation of SNAP, ii) Modernization of the Management
Plan of the El Boliche National Recreational Area.

The following are among the products most appreciated and valued by the stakeholders: The
NSAP Strategic Plan; The plan for strengthening social participation through the formation of
administrative committees; The new CCER Management Plan and MNP Administrative Plan;
The interactive and participatory work with stakeholders, especially with MAE officers, and the
infrastructure and equipment that was received.

The NSAP Strategic Plan is recognized as a valuable contribution of the project. In fact, the
instrument is already in use as a reference and source of support for various activities, including
the preparation of projects for several national and international institutions and NGO's.

The contribution of the project to the CCER Management Plan and the MNP Administrative Plan
is acknowledged, and there is agreement that these instruments are up to date and that they will
facilitate conservation work in these areas.

The concession processes for the tourism services of El Boliche and co-management of the
infrastructure at Cuicocha are very positive initiatives in the opinion of many MAE stakeholders
because they will free MAE officers from infrastructure maintenance activities, for the actual
work of conserving the site.




                                                   23

An exceptional contribution of the project is the preparation and application of various tools for
facilitating the administration of NSAP. Particular mention is made of the following: Evaluation
of Management Effectiveness of PA's, Biodiversity Monitoring System, legally validated the
proposal of a fiduciary fund for handling self-management income for PANE services, as well as
several methodological procedures that MAE officers can apply in the future, including
participatory preparation of terms of reference, invitations for concessions, etc.

The large majority of the beneficiaries acknowledge the effective work and commitment of the
managers and persons responsible for the project. The specific observation made in the midterm
evaluation is reiterated, highlighting the recovery of time lost at the beginning of the project, and
the capacity to achieve the goals and obtain projects in a much shorter time than was scheduled
for the project.

Concordant with the foregoing, the concern of several stakeholders should be noted regarding the
fact that some products, although finished, cannot be applied due to lack of time. This could be
the case for the NSPA Geo-Referenced Information System.

With regard to the training proposal, the project implemented the entire emergency training plan
including the following basic, priority items, Microsoft Project and English for central office
officers, environmental legislation for officers in regional offices and selected PA's, conflict
resolution for the 9 selected protected areas, and others.

With respect to complementary training for protected area management, the proposal was
completed as a finished product, and a course in Microsoft Office was given to park rangers of
the 9 selected protected areas. However, it was not possible to contract or implement the two
courses (central office and selected protected areas) on protected area management; they could
not be contracted due to the lack of time for implementing it, since the closing date of the project
was December 31, 2007. This is definitely one of the few products, possible the only one, that has
been left at this level.

A positive and generalized perception was noted regarding the openness and participation that
characterized the project. For example, there was the opportunity for MAE officers to participate
as stakeholders and share the responsibilities of decision-making processes such as the
preparation of Terms of Reference, selection processes for teams of consultants, follow up and
monitoring of consultants' activities, participation at events for presenting results and others. All
this allowed the MAE stakeholders to become familiar a priori with the results of the project, and
facilitated the application process.

Effective work was carried out to strengthen the social participation of communities through
administrative committees in the selected PA's, and their formation was legalized by means of
MAE ministerial resolutions.

It should be noted that one of the achievements of the project was the unity achieved among
several very diverse ethnic groups on the administrative committees, and in the case of CCER,
the formation of a central committee that joined together all the groups involved (Mestizos,
Afroecuadorians, and Indigenous Peoples) and defined several common planning and social
organization elements.

Although the committees are legally established and are functioning or participating in several
activities involving the project itself, stakeholders on the committees still have certain concerns,
questions or perceptions about obtaining funds for their operation. The managers of the project


                                                 24

began seeking financing and obtained initial funding to support the operation of the committees
while the Ministry of Environment identifies other alternatives for future support.

Although it is clear that MAE has no possibilities in its budget to finance the operational activities
of the committees, interest and concern about resolving this matter could be perceived in the
persons responsible for the selected PA's. For example, in MNP, an office has been made
available for the committee inside the facilities of the park administration in Puerto Lopez.
Undoubtedly, these initiatives could make the difference between the sustainability of the actions
of the committees or their disappearance over time.

Regarding the lack of training and lack of specialized knowledge shown by the communities that
are established in PA's and in their buffer zones, the intervention of the project has also been
effective. Worthy of note are the awareness and training activities that were carried out
simultaneously with the organizational process.

It is also recognized that an additional training and dissemination process for new knowledge on
conservation is pending in order to ensure the co-management commitment of the committees of
the selected PA's. That task, like many others, will be the responsibility of MAE officers, through
DBAP, which, as the direct beneficiaries of the project, will have the responsibility of providing
follow up and maintaining the active participation of the committees.

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The project has developed a sustainability strategy in collaboration with different actors that were
working toward the long-term administration of PAs--these actors include national and local
governments, NGOs, and international agencies.

Also, the project team has ensured that the investments made for the project would be sustainable
through strengthening the environmental authority, offering different alternatives such as the
administration by third parties of PA services, and providing community concessions, among
others.

A strategy of financial sustainability with the participation of different actors, including the
private sector has been elaborated, in such a manner to ensure the implementation of this strategy.
On the other hand, the project together with the DBPA, has elaborated a strategy for
strengthening the PA trust fund as an effective mechanism for financing actual expenses in these
areas. Furthermore, percentages of reinvestments of the self-generated funds of MAE are put
toward the maintenance of infrastructure and services.

The design and implementation of the trust fund and the institutionalization of the FAN are very
important elements for ensuring the sustainability of the project's objectives, principally in
relation to the three PAs that receive the support of the project.

The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) which was formed under the project, will support the
DBPA to strengthen the administration of the PAs. This Committee could eventually support the
leveraging of funds.




                                                 25

Local stakeholders have been involved through the Participatory Management Committees
formed in the selected PAs. These committees will respond to the reality of the local actors,
taking into consideration the project's objectives. PMCs have been strengthened through specific
training and are fully involved in PAs management.

The project has propelled the initiative to make official the National Biodiversity Strategy, the
Forestry Strategy, and the recommendations of the National Congress of Natural PAs (in which
are constituted political documents) through a linked judicial instrument.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation and
outcome issues)

5.1 Bank

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was
satisfactory. During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the adequacy of project
design and all major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic, and institutional,
including procurement and financial management. In addition, major risk factors and lessons
learned from other earlier projects in the social sector were considered and incorporated into the
project design.     In the design stage of the trust fund, many Ecuadorian experiences were
incorporated into the planning of a financial mechanism that was sensitive to local necessities but
also reflective of the lessons learned in similar projects.

Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who provided the
technical skill mix necessary for the project preparation. Through local consultations, the project
team was able to design operational strategies that were compatible with local and indigenous
communities' participatory mechanisms. During local consultations, opinions were obtained from
a total of 52 individuals through focus groups and interviews.

A Social Assessment (SA) was carried out during the preparation phase. The main objective was
to evaluate the development needs of local people and their relationship with the protected areas,
and to identify potential development activities that could be supported by the NSPA, based on
the existing community organizations, legislation, and the needs of the local population.

The Bank provided adequate resources in terms of staff weeks and dollar amount to ensure
quality preparation and appraisal work. The task team received strong support and guidance from
the Country Manager, Sector Manager, Country Director, and the Regional Coordinator. The
project was consistent with the CAS and government priorities in the sector at the time and was
consistent with the Bank's environmental protection and safeguard strategies.

Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory.

The Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was also satisfactory. The
project focused on its development impact. Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated,



                                                  26

and the project was adequately and closely supervised. The continuity of task management
significantly contributed in ensuring uninterrupted supervision of the project. The task team
maintained continuous monitoring of the project and dialogue with the authorities. Given the
political volatility of Ecuador, the task team played a key role by constantly explaining the project
to each of the seven persons who became Minister of Environment during the project period.

By monitoring the project's actions, the team was able to see not only where it was necessary to
deploy greater effort, but also which activities required finding alternate means of overcoming
challenges in order to proceed as smoothly as possible with the project's execution. In this sense,
the monitoring contributed to the fulfillment of the Annual Operation Plan, and the semester work
plans also were crucial for advancing the project, considering the objectives and goals. The task
team took into consideration the experience and knowledge of the local communities as well as
that of NGOs and the public sector when implementing the project's activities. During the
implementation, the skills, experiences, and knowledge of these local communities became
especially relevant to the theme of social participation.

Aide-Memoires were regularly prepared and the performance of the project both in terms of
achievement of development objectives and implementation were realistically rated in the
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs). Selection of consultants was reviewed by the Bank in
accordance with the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement and the Bank's Guidelines for
Selection and Employment of Consultants. The review of procurement of goods was also in
accordance with the provisions stipulated in the Grant Agreement and the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement. The task team carried out a Mid-Term Review in May 2006. The Review assessed:
(i) progress to date; (ii) the validity of the project's critical assumptions and risks; and (iii)
specific implementation problems.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory.

Based on the Bank performance during lending phase and supervision as discussed above, overall
Bank Performance is rated as Satisfactory.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory.

The government performance at preparation was satisfactory. The indications of government
commitment and ownership were demonstrated in the early stages of the project by the letter of
endorsement from the Minister of the Environment as Ecuador's GEF focal point. In addition, the
GOE's commitment to the project was reflected in a series of actions it had undertaken, namely:
(i) The project was identified by the GOE as a priority for the Bank support; (ii) It has strongly
supported the operation FAN, considering it a key partner for the sustainable management of
PAs; (iii) The MAE had provided US$1.0 million to the Protected Areas Trust Fund as part of the
matching funds of the GEF US$ 4.0 M; (iv) An Environmental Strategy for Sustainable
Development for Ecuador was presented by the Minister of Environment in September 1999 and
issued in October 2000; (v) The draft Biological Diversity Law was prepared through a highly
participatory process and was passed to the Congress for their review and approval; (vi) The


                                                  27

National Biological Diversity Strategy and its action plans were completed and approved; (vii)
The Protected Areas Advisory Committee was established to oversee the implementation of this
project and the overall management of the NSPA; The MAE had committed an additional
US$0.74 million in counterpart funds to allow and complement the timely allocation of GEF
resources for the project.

At the initial stage of implementation however, the government's commitment was not clear, as
reflected in the delay in the ratification and publication of the Grant Agreement N. 051537. Also,
the volatile political atmosphere which prevailed during the implementation period and the
resulting frequent change of administrations created instability and uncertainty in the country. As
mentioned in Section 2.2, during four years of project implementation, Ecuador had three
Presidents, and seven Minister of Environment. As a result, the government's commitment was
fluctuating and inconsistent, and very often, the political leadership was either totally missing or
rather weak.      Because of this situation, there was a lack of focus on the project and the
government did not make necessary decisions to make the project work effectively.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory.

Ministry of the Environment/Directorate of Biodiversity

MAE was responsible for the implementation of Components 1, 2 and 4 through the Grant
Agreement No. 051537 of US$3.7 million. MAE's performance during implementation is to be
evaluated in two phases: first phase lasting until the end of 2004; and the second phase from early
2005 until the close of the project.        In the first phase, the government performance was
unsatisfactory, particularly in relation to the following aspects: (i) the first technical-
administrative team did not perform well (ii) procurement management in terms of schedules and
reliability; (iii) legal covenants due to non-compliance in terms of timely reporting on technical
and financial aspects.

In the second phase, MAE's commitment and performance improved significantly. The second
technical-administrative team contracted by the project that supported project implementation
worked fully blended with the counterpart team at the Directorate of Biodiversity. An evaluation
system was established and applied twice a year to assess staff performance. MAE's procurement
performance was satisfactory. Although it did not have previous experience in procurement, it
acted diligently in searching and selecting Procurement Specialist and was eager to learn and
apply the Bank's procurement procedures. This team prepared the Project Procurement Plan,
coordinated its implementation, and prepared documents for invitations to bid and the contracts.

Overall, the project team had maintained adequate financial management arrangements during
implementation. The project experienced delays in submitting timely and accurate withdrawal
applications, supporting documentation, project plans, and reports and did not request access to
Client Connection. One of the major weaknesses of the project team was associated with project
planning and cash flow, since it was not accustomed to monitor plans against actuals on a
frequent basis. Audit reports and interim un-audited reports were submitted after the deadlines.
The project was subject to annual audits, where unqualified opinions were issued by auditors.
Internal control procedures were rated as satisfactory and recommendations were implemented.
Based on the issues above mentioned, financial management is rated as moderately satisfactory.
Even though these moderate shortcomings in financial management existed, they did not,



                                                 28

however, prevent the timely and reliable provision of information required to manage and
monitor the implementation of the project.

MAE established strategic partnerships among stakeholders at both the national level, including
NGOs such as CI and TNC, as well as at the international level, including the USAID. These
partnerships not only strengthened the initiative to achieve the common goals outlined in the
project's objective, but also optimized human resources and finances in the process. With respect
to the implementation of the PAF, MAE developed a positive working relationship among the
Directorate of Biodiversity, Regional Districts, Protected Areas, and the FAN.

National Environmental Fund-FAN

FAN was responsible for the implementation of the Component 3 through the Grant Agreement
No. 051486 of US$4.3 million. FAN's responsibility under the project was two-fold: i)
Administrator of the US $4.0 million GEF endowment and the PAF; and ii) Administrator of the
funds of MAE's Components 1, 2 and 4 during the first year of the project.

As administrator of the PAF, it ensured that the expenditure of its resources fulfilled the
requirements established by the project. It had adequate organizational structure with experienced
staff, and was capable of adequate planning and monitoring activities. FAN's information system
was capable of providing the basic financial information which was required and was supported
by acceptable information security practices. It also had an acceptable internal control
environment with documented manual of procedures and controls.

FAN performed its responsibilities according to the Action Plan and the schedule. It developed
fund raising strategies for the administration of PAF. It hired an Assistant Manager and Financial
Advisors to supervise the fund, managed well the administration of investment portfolio, and
could maintain the rate of returns at 6.5 % of the revenue.

As administrator of Components 1, 2 and 4, at the beginning, FAN's procurement and financial
management performance was moderately satisfactory, mainly because it failed to adequately
coordinate its actions with the MAE's technical and administrative staff. In addition, there was no
dedicated procurement and financial management staff to the project. Later on, coordination with
MAE improved and two additional administrative staff were contracted to significantly improve
overall administrative procedures.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:
Rating: Satisfactory.

In light of the performance of the government and the implementing agencies as discussed above,
the overall performance of the Borrower was satisfactory.

6.       Lessons Learned

A. Project-Specific

Protected Areas Policy and Legal Framework, Mainstreaming and Management Capacity

     Business administration and management skills throughout the Patrimony of Protected
         Areas will increase the ability to deal with pressures on protected areas by extractive
         industries and other activities and to increase the protected areas' economic and financial
         potential.



                                                  29

    In a context of decentralization that the MAE is pursuing in relation to protected areas
       management, local governments require capacity building and adequate resource
       allocation so that they can effectively take specific responsibilities in the management of
       municipal, provincial or regional protected areas. The same capacity building effort
       should be sought for private owners who are willing to offer their land to conservation
       activities.

    Since the initial operation of the GEF, biodiversity projects have tried to demonstrate the
       important link between biodiversity conservation and economic development, including
       improved livelihoods and cost-effectiveness to mainstream conservation in national
       development planning and economic policies. Effort should continue to actually
       demonstrate such a linkage through real, replicable initiatives involving populations
       whose livelihoods mainly and directly depend on the sustainable use of natural resources.

    The protected areas management plans should become tools not only for planning, but to
       actually increase overall management efficiency. These plans should permit the
       establishment of a structure synchronizing actions made within the central MAE and
       within the distinct regions of MAE with the end goal of ensuring an efficient
       administration of the protected areas. A wider dissemination of the knowledge
       accumulated though such planning exercises will also help to ensure long-term
       commitment by key actors.

Participatory Management of Protected Areas and Impacts on local beneficiaries

    Conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity in rural landscapes demand further
       development of sustainable productive systems, which in turn require an adequate system
       of technology transfer. The development of this type of initiatives could help Ecuador to
       position itself globally as a reservoir of natural resources and a producer of goods and
       services associated to its natural capital.

    Although developed through a participatory process, the sole process of preparation of
       the protected areas management plans is not enough to secure the ownership and full
       understanding of the proposed conservation strategies by stakeholders. For this reason,
       the project implementation strategies comprising the direct participation of the protected
       areas Management Committees should be further developed under new approaches to
       secure its adequate implementation of biodiversity conservation strategies.

    Communications and capacity development programs in natural resources management
       can significantly raise awareness and improve local beneficiaries' capacities and benefits
       both in the short and long terms. The capacity development activities implemented with
       the PMCs immediately established the necessary incentives for its members to become
       real actors in protected areas management. The activities developed under the protected
       areas operational plans have been incorporated to their own local planning on natural
       resources management. Motivation has become stronger when PMCs have seen their
       proposals being part of the decision making process and incorporated to operational plans.




                                                 30

Biodiversity conservation as a cross-sector issue

    Impacts of protected areas management and biodiversity conservation projects need an
       adequate period of time to be measured and assessed. This project was designed to be
       developed over a 4-year period, however important time delays at the initial stage
       implementation due to the reasons explained in other sections of this ICR, reduced the
       implementation time to about half of the originally planned period. Even though this
       project would have been implemented over the four years, it is still not enough to
       measure the impacts of the actions of the project.

    Planning instruments for the long-term management of protected areas must be clearly
       articulated to national development plans and agendas in order to incorporate sustainable
       biodiversity management as a key element for national and local development. The
       project was successful in considering the government's Development Plan to secure the
       adequate treatment and long term sustainability of the protected areas.

    Efforts put in a project by the government officials and social actors/activists, to reinforce
       social participation and creating/improving local awareness on the need for biodiversity
       conservation will yield good results.

    Any strategy aimed at achieving biodiversity sustainable management, must consider: (i)
       supporting institutional development at various levels (national, departmental and
       municipal); (ii) support administrative decentralization without hindering the
       development of the central government; (iii) respect the country's particular cultural and
       ethnic diversity; (iv) ensure that conservation and sustainable use initiatives result in local
       benefits, and (v) relate natural resource management to rural development.

    Even though the project has substantially increased management efficiency of the
       selected protected areas, there is still a strong pressure on natural resources, several
       protected areas are being logged illegally and are subject to clearing for cattle ranching
       and small farmer agriculture. New approaches are called for with the same goals but with
       better tools and more effective institutional arrangements.       Instead of the legalistic,
       process-driven experience of the past, which has not proven sufficient or effective, policy
       and institutions should be driven by specific objectives and institutions should be held
       accountable for their achievements.

    Further development of incentives need to be developed in order to get local communities
       and governments involved in protected areas and biodiversity conservation. One of the
       critical and still unsolved issues is land tenure, which need to be more equitable and
       secure. Directly related to the management of protected areas, indigenous land titling has
       advanced, but the process has been characterized by conflict and many claims have not
       been addressed. Land policies need to support a model of growth and poverty reduction
       that improves living standards, promotes social inclusion and maintains environmental
       sustainability.

    Part of the solution to land tenure conflicts must be achieved through recognition of
       communal and individual property rights, and as such should be linked to an
       environmental territorial ordering and the generation of incentives to promote ecological,
       economic and social sustainability. Communal territories are central to this process and
       should constitute a living link between conservation and socioeconomic development.



                                                31

B. General Applicability

Important factors for the success of a project

The continuity of task management, and having the Task Team Leader (TTL) based in the
country office will significantly contribute in ensuring uninterrupted supervision of the project.

Project Design, Management and Implementation Issues

    The approval of laws should be avoided as a condition under projects with such time
        frames, given that this is beyond the scope of action of the project team and the
        government executing agency (i.e. the executive branch of government) given that the
        passage of laws is in the hands of the legislative branch.

    Based on previous experiences, the establishment of project units at the executing agency
        has strongly limited the integration of the project activities to the executing agencies'
        planning, effectiveness and most important, ownership. Such units also face serious
        difficulties to transfer the capacity needed to secure the sustainability of the project
        actions. After assessing the results of the management arrangements under this project, it
        could be confirmed that a support technical team fully blended with and integrated to the
        counterpart team has only benefited project's implementation, has secured efficiency,
        encouraged ownership and has allowed sharing of knowledge between the project team
        and the MAE's technical team. It is expected that in the near future, the MAE will
        become fully capable of managing a new operation with its own technical staff.

    Consulting a range of stakeholders through the Participatory Management Committees
        (PMCs) and other mechanisms such as the Protected Areas Advisory Committee and the
        agencies that actively participated in the development of the Protected Areas Financial
        Strategy, has strongly promoted ownership of the project objectives and activities. This
        combination of consulting sectors has enriched project implementation with technical,
        scientific and traditional knowledge and has created a space to develop innovative
        mechanisms for protected areas management. At the same time, it has facilitated capacity
        building and transfer of knowledge at the field, establishing local teams composed of
        protected areas staff and members of the PMCs, capable of carrying out planning and
        monitoring activities.

    The design and implementation of a long-term financing mechanisms to cover the
        recurrent costs of protected areas, in this case, the PAF, secured the overall sustainability
        of the actions implemented under the project.

    The implementation of biodiversity conservation/protected areas projects in the Andean
        Region has demonstrated that those projects aimed at achieving change at the system
        level are more efficient when they have adequate resources, a sufficiently long time
        frame and a realistic implementation plan. For this reason, future operations should seek
        a programmatic approach and ensure that beneficiary countries provide strategic contexts
        for long-term implementation, under which GEF should progressively reduce
        participation and help to leverage other funds.




                                                 32

Monitoring and Evaluation

   The lack of key performance indicators for biodiversity can impede the ability of project
      to track performance and assessed sustained results. A well developed monitoring and
      evaluation system facilitates an adaptive management approach during and beyond
      implementation. One of the highest priorities of this project was the development and
      operation of a sound monitoring system, including impact assessment related to the
      implementation of the annual operational plans and the impacts on biodiversity
      conservation.

   Monitoring system with measurable indicators as well as a strategic framework are
      critical to ensure a long term assessment of impacts and to define the objectives and
      scope of future operations. Monitoring systems and indicators also need to consider and
      be consistent with the constantly changing institutional and political context.

   The application of the World Bank/World Wild Life monitoring tool to assess the
      efficiency of individual protected areas has been an extremely valuable mechanism at the
      main stages of project implementation. At the initial stage, it allowed the development of
      a solid protected areas status baseline and the definition of the key indicators of the
      biodiversity monitoring system referred below. The results of the annual assessments
      actually had an impact on decision making, resulting on the development of management
      strategies that are currently reflected under the Protected Areas Strategic Plan.

   To achieve the GEF conservation objectives for the project, indicators to measure the
      sustainability of biodiversity must be in place, taking into consideration the carrying
      capacity of the Protected Areas and the current and projected future resource use patterns
      by communities. It is important to ensure that during and at the end of the intervention
      the conservation mandate and objectives are clearly articulated to the participants,
      including the Participatory Management Committees of the Protected Areas. The
      monitoring system developed under the project includes a very friendly data collection
      and processing of information methodology as to allow field staff supported by PMCs to
      accurately produce reports. The MAE should continue to provide technical input and
      process the necessary reports to conduct analyses of the state of conservation in protected
      areas using simplified and user friendly formats.

Government Commitment and Sustainability

   Political will is necessary to ensure the financial sustainability of protected areas. For the
      first time, the MAE has been able to move a step forward in adopting the various policy
      instruments as State policies, including the National Biodiversity Strategy and the
      Forestry Strategy and the recently updated Strategic Plan for the National System of
      Protected Areas. The Strategic Plan provides the mechanisms to optimize the operation of
      the National System of Protected Areas, including the creation of connected subsystems
      that would incorporate local governments and organizations and will better define the
      role of MAE.

   The MAE does not need to be responsible for all aspects of protected areas management.
      Local governments and private sector can play a critical role in management and could
      help leverage resources. Under this context, the MAE has developed a sustainability
      strategy in collaboration with different actors that are working toward the long-term



                                               33

         administration of protected areas--these actors include sector governments, local actors,
         national and local NGOs, and international agencies.

      In spite of the lack of a Biodiversity Law, this project has demonstrated that: clear and
         improved policy framework and regulations regarding management of protected areas;
         and use of natural resources can provide a stronger enabling environment and provide
         additional conditions for sustainability.

      Financial sustainability is key for the long-term operation of the National System of
         Protected Areas. The design and implementation of the trust fund and the
         institutionalization of the National Environmental Fund have been very important
         elements for ensuring the sustainability of the project's objectives, principally in relation
         to the protected areas that receive the support of the project.

      A conservation fund such as the PAF is not enough to secure the financial sustainability
         of the patrimony of protected        areas. For this reason, the Project supported the
         development of a financial sustainability strategy with the participation of different
         actors, in such a manner as to ensure the implementation of the Strategic Plan and the
         protected areas management plans.         The financial strategy has identified several
         mechanism of self revenue, two of which are currently operating and will strengthen PAF
         as an effective mechanism to cover the recurrent costs of protected areas. Furthermore, a
         portion of the self-generated funds of MAE are now financing the maintenance of
         infrastructure and basic services.

 Implementation

      The challenge of implementing a simple project like this cannot be underestimated in an
         atmosphere of political instability. While one would think that the administration of PA
         within the government would not be affected by political instability, it turned out that
         during implementation political instability and constant personnel changes were affecting
         the activities of the project.

      It is important to establish a basic working team that provides efficient support in the
         distinct actions that a project should undertake. The fact that the project was placed
         within the MAE's central facility and not just be an executing unit, enabled the MAE
         functionaries to be actively involved in the project activities and this factor facilitated
         smooth implementation of the project.

 Procurement

 Lack of a Procurement Specialist for the project at its preparation stage would lead to having
 inadequate initial procurement plan and organizational arrangements.

 Due to the high turnover of the staff within most of the Ministries, a training program to
 strengthen the Ministry's capacity to carry out procurement is essential.

Financing

      Implementation of PAF should always be considered as a joint effort between the MAE
         and FAN, and this can never be overlooked

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Institutional Strengthening and Legal Development

(i) Update of the National System of Protected Areas Strategic Plan

The conceptual basis for this activity was the Strategic Plan developed back on 1999 under the
GEF-funded Biodiversity Protection Project. The Plan was reviewed and updated through a
consultative and participatory process which secured the inclusion of the current social, economic
and institutional arrangements in Ecuador. This process also facilitated the incorporation of the
needs and priorities of different stakeholders and the consolidation as key elements of
biodiversity conservation and sustainable development in Ecuador. The Plan was approved on
November of 2007 and will become the framework for future operations supporting the
sustainable management of biodiversity and protected areas in Ecuador.

An Action Plan for the period 2007-2008 was developed in order to promote the implementation
of the Strategic Plan, it has been circulated and consulted among key stakeholders to secure their
commitment for the execution of the specific activities.

(ii) Technical Advisory Committee

Given the delayed implementation during the first two years, the Technical Advisory Committee
for the implementation period (an Advisory Committee was established before to support the
project preparation8) was established on July of 2004, it is composed of several specialists in
protected areas management, from the academia and local NGOs. Since its establishment, it has
provided technical assistance to the Directorate of Biodiversity on the preparation and updating
of both, the Strategic Plan and the Protected Areas Management Plans and its further
implementation and overall project implementation. It has also provided permanent advise to the
authorities at the Ministry of the Environment on improved protected areas management.

(iii) Financial and Managerial System

The project provided technical and financial assistance for the design and implementation of a
financial and managerial system. This system is currently under full operation allowing a
significantly improved resource allocation, regulation , monitoring and supervision capacities by
staff at the central unit and field offices. This activity has also included the development of
operational manuals and other administrative tools, after several training sessions, the staff at the
MAE is fully capable of following and applying such tools and the system itself. The structure of
the system is flexible as to allow modifications as needed to adapt to new administrative and
managerial procedures that might be in place in the future.

(iv) Sustainable Financial Strategy

This subcomponent was composed of two main activities:                identification of own-generated
revenue mechanisms, and implementation of pilot concessions for services.



8The initial Advisory Committee was established mainly to support project preparation and comprised
representatives of al least 20 organizations, including MAE, NGOs, academia and others. In order to have a
more operational Committee for the implementation phase, MAE decided to create a new one, with no
more than five members selected among those ones who participated on the preparation phase.


                                                      37

Identification of own-generated revenue mechanisms. Before starting any specific study, the
Directorate of Biodiversity and the project team decided to initiate consultations with national
and international organizations that were already developing information to establish a sound
sustainable financial strategy for the National System of Protected Areas. In order to avoid
duplication of efforts, to better coordinate the activities related to the formulation of the strategy
and to leverage funds, it was decided to establish the Promotor Group, comprised by MAE, the
Project Team, Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy, the National Environmental
Fund, USAID, and the national Foundations EcoCiencia, Natura and Mentefactura. The work
developed by this Group included the identification and design of revenue generating
mechanisms and the evaluation of experiences in decentralized management of protected areas.
The Strategy included current and potential funding sources and specific mechanisms for
generating non-budgetary revenues, such as income from the sale of environmental services,
tourism patents, service fees collection, and research permits. The legal framework to implement
one of these mechanisms has been developed and is now operational, this is the tariff collected by
MAE for the telecommunications infrastructure located inside the protected areas.

The evaluation of decentralized management experiences was also developed : Under this
section the study would analyze and evaluate experiences in decentralized management of PAs in
the country, that would guide the decentralization and co-management processes in the future. To
complement the efforts of the Financial Strategy developed by the Promotor Group, an economic
valuation of protected areas was developed. This study helped to quantify the existing and
potential revenues generated and its contribution to the national economy.

(v) Pilot concessions of services

The project carried out the legal and institutional analysis for the implementation of concession
of tourism services in the two protected areas. The selected protected areas where the Cotacahi-
Cayapas Reserve and the Boliche Recreational Area, both with tourism infrastructure financed
under the first protected areas GEF project. The whole process included: identification of possible
concessions (services and potential concessionaires); design of legal instruments; selection of
criteria and procedures; preparation of bidding documents; establishing system of follow-up of
concession contracts and agreements and evaluation of implemented concessions. In the case of
the Boliche Recreational Area, an additional task to complete the legal framework was the
updating of the Management Plan.

Given the delayed implementation of the project and the time necessary to complete the legal
analysis and framework, it was not possible to actually pilot and assess this mechanism. However
the project was able to complete the bidding process and it is expected that in the coming months,
MAE will sign contracts with the selected concessionaires. As part of the internal monitoring
system, MAE has developed a sub-system to monitor the implementation of these concessions.

(vi) Training Program

The project provided training for technical staff of DBPA and PA managers in the administration
of protected areas. The program was focused on building capacities to ensure the proper
implementation of the protected areas management plans and to carry our overall natural
resources management planning. The training program was designed on the basis of an initial
survey and identification of training priorities, given the reduced implementation period, MAE
decided to prioritize training events only in the country. The beneficiaries were staff at the central
units and field staff of the nine protected areas covered by the project.



                                                  38

(vii) Development of Legal Instruments

For the reasons explained before, the Biodiversity Law approval was eliminated as one of the
activities under the project. Bearing in mind the importance of having a solid legal framework to
secure the sustainability of the protected areas, MAE and the project team developed an initial
analysis to identify the legal gaps and needs of regulations to cover critical aspects of protected
areas management.

In this way and articulated to both, the Strategic Plan and the protected areas management plans,
the project team developed the following instruments: i) internal regulation (Ministerial Decree)
stemming from the Environmental Management Law for the operation of the National System of
National Protected Areas, ii) regulation to operate the participatory management committees; iii)
regulation for co-management agreements, iv) regulation to establish and operate municipal,
provincial, community and private protected areas; v) regulation to re-invest in protected areas all
revenues generated by them; vi) regulations for the concession of tourism services; vii) regulation
for the administration of revenues generated by telecommunications infrastructure.

Component 2: Participatory Management of Priority Protected Areas

This component was developed to facilitate participatory management in two priority protected
areas: Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve and Machalilla National Park, by developing co-
management models according to the specific social and political context of each area, and
promoting the creation and strengthening of the Participatory Management Committees (PMCs),
to promote the participation of different stakeholders in the management of the selected PAs.

The project provided financial and technical assistance to ensure effective management of the two
areas selected by the project. The specific activities included de updating or preparing
management plans, establishing the PMCs and the identification and execution of priority
activities stemming from the management plans.

As part of the implementation of the management plans, the project financed the basic recurrent
costs during the first year (to cover the gap until the protected areas trust fund generates interests),
basic equipment and environmental education and public awareness activities in the two selected
PAs and their buffer zones.

(i) Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve

The project fully supported the preparation of the management plan, which became an instrument
to identify the priority programs and actions, as well as the administrative mechanisms to
implement an effective management in this PA. To ensure public participation during the
management plan's design, several workshops were organized with different stakeholders related
to this PA, including the local communities that live inside or around the area, and the productive
sectors (i.e. tourism, forestry, mining, and agricultural) which use the natural resources of the area
and its buffer zone.

The project also helped to create and strengthen the Participatory Management Committees
(PMC) to enhance coordination and communication among different stakeholders related to the
PA management. A total of seven committees were established in this Reserve.




                                                  39

The Cuicocha's Environmental Interpretation Center, located in the upper zone of the Reserve,
was remodeled and an intensive environmental education and interpretation program was
developed to communicate the ecological and cultural importance of this reserve and the NSPA.
Interpretation trails around the Cuiciocha lagoon were given maintenance and new ones were
constructed.

The project also strengthened the technical and logistical capacity of the reserve's staff for
implementing and effective control and patrolling program, through hiring community park
rangers (with the protected areas trust fund) and financing basic patrolling equipment (field
equipment, uniforms, motorcycles, vehicle, and canoes).

(ii) Machalilla National Park

The project provided financial and technical assistance for the preparation of the Park큦
Managerial Plan, which stemmed from the Management Plan prepared under the first protected
areas project and identified the priority programs and actions, as well as the administrative
mechanisms to implement an effective management in this PA.. This process was also carried out
with the participation of all stakeholders, including the local communities that live inside or
around the area, and the productive sectors (i.e. tourism, fishing, and agricultural) which use the
natural resources of the area and its buffer zone.

The implementation of       the Managerial Plan consisted of strengthening the technical and
operational capacities of the field staff (training program described above), the improved
protection of land and marine biodiversity and cultural resources, environmental and social
research and monitoring, control and patrolling, education and public awareness, and promotion
of tourism and recreation in the PA. Park infrastructure (ranger stations and minor tourism
facilities) was upgraded and basic equipment, (field equipment, GPS, radios, computers,
motorcycles, navigation and communication equipment) was provided.

Finally the project created and strengthened the Participatory Management Committee (PMC) to
enhance coordination and communication among different stakeholders related to the PA
management.

(iii) Cuyabeno Wildlife Production Reserve

Given the co-financing provided by the IDB's project to this Reserve, the project complement
the activities to strength the control and patrolling actions in the Reserve, by financing the
recurrent costs during the first year and half of the project and afterwards through the protected
areas trust fund and also provided field and transport (canoes) equipment .

Component 3: Sustainable Financing

This component promoted the consolidation of the Protected Areas Fund (PAF), that operated
within the Environmental Fund of Ecuador. PAF was designed as a strategic response to the lack
of long-term funding to support conservation of PAs. Once essential recurrent costs of PA's
have been covered at least for 12 protected areas, other resources were mobilized to support
biodiversity conservation.

The involvement of FAN as an independent autonomous organization, ensured accountability and
greater efficiency in the utilization of resources. The project allocated $US 8 million (GEF: US
$ 4 million; Germany-KFW: $3 million and GOE: US $ 1 million) towards the Fund's


                                                 40

endowment; which, through interests earned, covered the basic recurrent costs. The main
outcomes under this component could be described as follows: i) Capitalization of the protected
Areas Fund (FAP) to $12 million before 2006,; ii) the FAP supports about 24% of the basic
recurrent costs of the National System of Protected Areas (SNAP), iii) The FAP is covering the
recurrent costs of 11 protected areas, 2 more that the original goal. The following analysis will
contribute to better illustrate the actual contribution of the Protected Areas Trust Fund to the
patrimony of protected areas.

In 2005, the Ministry of the Environment jointly with The Nature Conservancy, Conservation
International, KFW-Germany, National Environmental Fund, Fundacin Natura, Fundacin
EcoCiencia, USAID, UICN and Mentefactura, developed the analysis of financing needs for
Ecuador's patrimony of protected areas. The financial needs were determined under three
scenarios:

a) Baseline: implies an estimate of the basic recurrent costs of the protected areas to secure basic
needs for management such as staff, basic services, maintenance of infrastructure.

b) Basic Scenario: takes into account the following principles: consolidate the presence of the
Ministry of the Environment in the national protected areas, ensure the integrity of the protected
areas and facilitate a participatory management involving local communities, local governments
and other civil society actors. This scenario is aimed at identifying the basic needs of protected
areas through the implementation of the two programs: administration/control/surveillance and
participatory planning;

c)   Integrated   Scenario:   comprises     the   effective   implementation    of   five  programs:
administration/control/surveillance; participatory planning/community
development/environmental education; tourism/research, management of natural resources and
environmental monitoring.

Based on the information provided by this study, the actual impact of the Protected Areas Fund
(FAP) through the project has been significant and will continue to be over the coming years and
could be assessed at different levels. The annual contribution of FAP to the patrimony of
protected areas is currently estimated at US $ 670,000 per year. The annual financial needs of the
patrimony of national protected areas, currently comprising 36 conservation units, are as follows:
baseline: US $ 2,705,788; basic scenario: US $ 6,293,455 and integrated scenario: US
$ 12,211,681. Therefore PAF is currently covering 24.76% of the recurrent costs (baseline),
10.64% of the basic scenario and 5.48% of the integrated scenario.

At the level of the 11 protected areas targeted by PAF under the project, the annual financial
needs have been established as follows: baseline: US $ 1,057,115; basic scenario: US $
3, 096,053 and integrated scenario: US $ 6,124,300. This means that PAF is currently covering
63 % of the recurrent costs (baseline), 21.64 % of the basic scenario and 10.94 % of the
integrated scenario.

Although there is still a financial gap at all the financing scenarios, in most of the protected areas
it will fall within the Government's capacity to generate additional annual income that will help
to fill these gaps channeled through PAF and other mechanisms to ensure they reach the financial
needs. Concession for tourism services and income from telecommunications infrastructure, both
mechanisms developed under the project, will help to increase self revenues in the future and
substantially reduce the financial gap. To strategically complement this effort, the activities
developed under components 1, 2, and 4, as described in this section, have clearly contributed to


                                                   41

implement the programs described under the basic and the integrated scenarios such as
administration, control, surveillance, participatory planning, community development and
environmental monitoring.

Component 4: Project Monitoring and Evaluation

The project developed the Information System for the National System of Protected Areas,
piloted in the nine protected areas covered by the project. The implementation of this system has
provided the following: i) documentation and dissemination of guides, forms, experiences, results,
regulations, restrictions, procedures and other work tools for stakeholders that support
conservation, ii) a planning tool that also controls and monitors MAE and the Department of
Biodiversity activities. The system was designed to collect and disseminate information through
Internet and included a spatial component, with a geographic information system, to manage
digital geographic information. The data basis currently designed include detailed geographic,
ecological and socioeconomic information, as well as data on staff, infrastructure, equipment and
management plans of each area. The system also included information about the status of
biodiversity, tourism activities, revenues generated by PAs, and administrative procedures on
each area (such as research permits, tourism patents, and visitor records).

The application of the World Bank/World Wild Life monitoring tool to assess the efficiency of
individual protected areas has been an extremely valuable mechanism at the main stages of
project implementation. At the initial stage, it allowed the development of a solid protected areas
status baseline and the definition of the key indicators of the biodiversity monitoring system
referred below. The results of the annual assessments had an impact on decision making, resulting
on the development of management strategies that are currently reflected under the Protected
Areas Strategic Plan.

The project provided technical assistance to develop methodologies to monitor biodiversity in the
protected areas, the system was piloted in the nine protected areas covered by the project.
Criteria and indicators were identified to carry out the long-term monitoring of the status of
conservation of biodiversity. A user friendly collection and processing data methodology was
developed as to facilitate the direct involvement of field staff and the report processing by the
central unit.

Annex 5.          Beneficiary Survey Results

Evaluation by Beneficiaries of the Project involved all the activities and products of the project.
The specific objectives of the Evaluation were: i) to define and validate the elements of a
baseline for the project according to indicators that were agreed to with the coordinators,
stakeholders and persons responsible for the SNAP-GEF project, ii) to define qualitative and
quantitative indicators for evaluating the results of the project, iii) to design and implement a
methodological proposal and tools for the final evaluation of the project by the beneficiaries, and
iv) to evaluate the results of components 1, 2 and 4 of the SNAP-GEF project from the
perspective of the beneficiaries and persons responsible for future project activities.

The following were identified as direct beneficiaries of the project: i) MAE (Ministry of
Environment), through the Department of Biodiversity, Protected Areas and Wildlife, ii) selected
PA's (Protected Areas) (Machalilla National Park, MNP and the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological
Reserve, CCER), and iii) communities in the buffer zones of the selected Protected Areas. The
following were identified as indirect beneficiaries: Second Tier Organizations, Local
Governments, Non-Governmental Organizations, Universities, and Research Centers. The
benefits of the project are: An Overall Benefit for Ecuadorian society through the identification,
testing and application of methodological tools and procedures for the conservation and
sustainable use of PA's, and a Specific Benefit due to the opportunity for the conservation of
some PA's to become self-sustaining based on the methodological tools that were applied.

Results of the intervention of the project (perception and reaction of the beneficiaries)

Identification and definition of benefits and beneficiaries

The conclusion can be drawn that for most stakeholders it is very clear for that the project has
influenced the entire group of beneficiaries described, and that some of them have certainly self-
designated themselves as beneficiaries of the project.

A general consensus was also found regarding the definition of beneficiaries of the project. For
Ecuadorian society in general, everyone is a beneficiary of the project in all its facets (the
activities under components and subcomponents) are everyone, and this is demonstrated by the
generation of tools and assistance with processes that involve conservation. An observation made
in the midterm evaluation that the benefits of the project would transcend boundaries was also
ratified, because conservation work is of global interest. For example, the activities carried out in
the two selected areas: MNP and CCER, obviously have an international connotation and image,
since these areas are frequently visited by foreigners (tourists, sportspeople and scientific
observers). The intervention of the project will have undoubtedly facilitated the provision of
services and improved the image of the selected areas as a result of the training and work tools
provided to park rangers, improvements to facilities and the modernization of equipment at
control and inspection posts, as well as improvements to signs and information systems, among
others. All this is undoubtedly a project benefit for society.

Characteristics of the population involved

The characteristics of the local population involved in the selected protected areas are as follows:

i)       Ethnic and cultural diversity are apparent in the two selected areas; however, the
         population in CCER is much more ethnically and culturally diverse than the population in
         MNP. For example, in the high area of CCER there are at least three ethnic groups:


                                                  47

      Mestizos, Awas, and Kichuas, and the latter includes the Cotacachi, Imbaya, Otavalo and
      possible Natabuela groups. In the low area of CCER, there are also three distinct ethnic
      groups: Mestizos, Afroecuadorians and Chachis. In MNP, there are three ethnic groups:
      Mestizos, Mantas and possibly Huancavilcas.

ii)   Although this ethnic and cultural diversity found in the selected protected areas could be
      seen as an advantage, it is also the case that for the purposes of planning or agreeing to
      proposals, this diversity becomes a potential problem. Cultural diversity means diversity
      of opinions, beliefs and behaviors, which makes it much more difficult to agree to
      proposals, such as the formation of administrative committees. Therefore, one of the
      noteworthy achievements of the project has been the consensus achieved by all these
      diverse groups regarding the administrative committees, and for CCER, the formation of
      a central committee that includes all the above-mentioned groups and defines several
      common planning and social organization elements.


iii)  An aspect involving population that was noted in the midterm evaluation and which has
      not been validated, is that apparently the population involved in MNP shows more
      leadership and professionalism that the population involved in CCER. Most of the people
      in the MNP Sectorial Committee are different types of professionals, some in fact,
      practice their professions in the official agencies of Puerto Lopez County. This could be
      perceived as a comparative advantage compared to other social groups; the level of
      dialog, the depth of the analysis of problems, and the capacity to propose solutions is
      apparently much greater and more pertinent, and behaviors and positions are more likely
      involve proposals rather than claims or petitions. For example, several officers of the
      administrative committee in Machalilla were very clear on the need to ensure and
      strengthen the conservation of the park. It is felt that this interest could be to ensure the
      sustainability of the tourism business, which involves private businesses, and that is the
      true interest in forming the local committees that support conservation.

iv)   The number of administrative committees formed in CCER (four in the high area and
      three in the low area) is a result not only of the geographical diversity and size of the
      area, but also its ethnic and cultural diversity. Precisely one of the complaints of some of
      the participants in the low area of CCER was that the president of the central committee
      is Indigenous from the high area, and up to this time, they have not been able to agree on
      joint proposals or even formal meetings.

v)    However, the foregoing does not mean that the project did not raise environmental
      awareness or interest in conservation among the populations involved. Despite the fact
      that the committee of Cuellaje in the region of Intag is in a conflictive and controversial
      area involving a copper mine for which a concession has been granted in an area near
      CCER and there is a declared social conflict due to the matter, the communities that are
      involved in the project and associated with the above-mentioned committee showed a
      completely favorable and optimistic attitude toward conservation and are willing to
      prepare and administer projects and cooperate fully with the initiative of the committees.

        Degree of organization of the population involved

Although a lot of work has been done on community organization, and great progress has been
made in the buffer zones of the selected PA's, it is evident that (before the project) there was a
high degree of disorganization in the management of those PA's. It is obvious that the
intervention of the project has played a key and timely role by proposing and executing a process
for strengthening and organizing the administrative committees as agencies for co-managing
conservation in the selected PA's.

The administrative committees are formed under the law, and legalized by ministerial resolutions
issued by MAE itself. The committee for CCER was established by Ministerial Resolution
number 180, published in the Official Gazette number 64 on April 16, 2007, while in the case of
MNP, it is Ministerial Resolution number 163, published in the Official Gazette number 12 on
January 31, 2007. A Central Committee was established for MNP, and a central committee
formed by seven sector committees (four in the high area and three in the low area) in CCER. All
have a functional organization with secretaries or work commissions covering specific matters
such as tourism, administration and finance, education and training, projects, etc.

Regarding the apparent generalized lack of concern and lack of interest in organizing local
administrative committees to support conservation in the selected PA's, it is acknowledged that,
through the persons responsible for the areas and the social promoters, and the field work of park
rangers, the intervention of the project has been effective. It is evident that the organizations and
social groups involved has participated in an enthusiastic manner. Admittedly, in some cases the
lack of interest was justified due to a lack of awareness of the importance of conservation, or the
capital value of PA's; however, through promotional activities and interventions by the project, it
has been possible to overcome these feeling among the populations and obtain their commitment
to co-managing the PA's.

Regarding the lack of training and specialized knowledge that characterized the communities
established in the PA's and in their buffer zones, here as well the intervention of the project has
been effective. This included awareness and training activities carried out simultaneously with the
organizational process; however, it is acknowledged that an ongoing process of encouraging
training and disseminating new knowledge on conservation matters is still pending in order to
ensure the committees' commitment to co-managing the selected PA's. This task will be the
responsibility of MAE officers, through DBAPVS and the protected areas, which, as the direct
beneficiaries of the project, would be responsible for providing follow up and maintaining the
active participation of the committees.

        Responsibilities of the committees in co-managing conservation

The baseline proposal and especially the midterm evaluation process, identified resistance and
even a tendency by some population groups to oppose the conservation of the selected PA's. It is
obvious that the project has made significant progress in raising environmental awareness by the
communities and groups involved. Based on the opinions of the participants in group workshops
held at the three sites (Cotacachi for the high area of CCER, Las Peas for the low area of CCER,
and Puerto Lopez for MNP), a significant change in the attitude of the participants was seen;
ignoring the weaknesses that still persist in the organization and operation of the committees, they
emphasized with great conviction the need to support and participate in conservation activities.

The project thus successfully completed the process of organizing the buffer communities of the
selected PA's into local administrative committees. However, it is necessary here to mention


                                                  49

explicitly some perceptions or concerns that have detected in the beneficiaries regarding the
future organization and operation of the committees. The same questions or queries from the
midterm evaluation were used, and these will help reflect upon and externalize at the end of the
project the changes observed throughout this organizational process:

What is the true role to be played by the committees?

Are they supervisors, alarms, or catalysts of the interests of local societies? Are they protagonists
of conservation, or are they co-managers of the policies and programs proposed by MAE? In this
regard, the opinions during the midterm evaluation were clearly divergent; now, at the end of the
project, interesting progress can be seen in the work of the committees. Although some doubts
persist about whether or not the committees have the capacity to be independent protagonists of
conservation activities in the selected PA's, the majority agree and are aware that the role of the
committees is to support and cooperate with whatever MAE does. It is agreed and acknowledged
that MAE is responsible for conservation decisions, and that the committees will not be able to
carry out independent or isolated interventions in the selected PA's.

Is the legal support received by the committees when their regulations were approved by means
of a Ministerial Resolution sufficient? Here again there are divided opinions. On one hand, it was
explained that the committees, having been established under the provisions of TULAS, and now
with the approval and publication of the Ministerial Resolutions in the Official Gazette, the
administrative committees have been legalized as organizations that support the conservation
actions undertaken by MAE. In addition, their role as inspectors and alarms regarding possible
surprise interventions in the PA's is recognized. They can play this role much better than the park
rangers.

Will the committees have economic support (first from the project and later from MAE) for their
functioning and operation? First, it should be remembered that all the members of the committees
agree, without exception, on the need for funds for their functioning and operation. However, it
was very clear that the project, in accordance with its commitment, supported the process of
organizing, legalizing and strengthening the committees, without undertaking any commitment to
finance their functioning expenses after they had been legally established. However, as was noted
earlier, the persons responsible for the project as well as MAE officers, have been diligently
seeking funds to support the functioning of the committees; for example, funds have been
obtained for this purpose from the FAP Cycle and from donors. In MNP an office has already
been arranged for the committee in the facilities of the park administration in Puerto Lopez; it
was also mentioned that a small amount of funds from third party donations has been set aside to
support certain urgent expenses of the committee and its officers. Undoubtedly, these initiatives
could make the difference between the sustainability of the actions of the committees, or their
disappearance over time. All the members should cooperate to make this process sustainable.

Can the local committees accept responsibility for administering certain services of the PA's?
Here also there were diverging opinions; however, by the end of the project the matter was
clarified. The stakeholders on the committees know that their participation involves the co-
management of conservation activities in the selected PA's. They also know that the committees,
as such, are not juridical entities with the capacity to make contracts or issue invoices, and they
therefore cannot directly access the concession of services, but rather must do so through their
member organizations that have legal status and are able to make contracts.

Can administrative committees develop projects to obtain funds from donors or competitive
funds? Here it was found that some leaders and committee members still have expectations about


                                                 50

preparing and implementing productive projects in buffer zones, or conservation projects in the
selected PA's. However, it has been clarified once again, especially by the participants from
MAE and DBAPVS, that these projects can be developed, but under the supervision of MAE or
through members of the committees (for example, municipalities, parish boards, or NGO's), but
not directly as committees.

        Principal interests and activities of the populations involved

i)      All the stakeholders and persons involved have particular interests and needs, and
        sometimes they are contradictory. Communities need income to ensure their survival and
        thus sometimes exert pressure for resources from the protected areas or buffer zones.
        Although NGO's propose conservation actions, they require the involvement of
        communities to justify the financing of their projects, and this conditions or at least
        prioritizes the financing of productive activities. Persons responsible for protected areas
        have a mandate to conserve the PA's, but they cannot do so alone using coercion, as it
        was thought in the past. On the contrary, they need the support and participation of the
        communities, and that justifies whole process of forming committees.

ii)     There is thus a consensus that to ensure the conservation of PA's, first the needs of the
        community must be satisfied. It would be ideal if proposals could be found that satisfy
        both things simultaneously. However, it is agreed that this is not something that can be
        resolved with a project and, in fact, it was not a commitment of the project.

iii)    The criteria that the implementation of productive enterprises managed for the benefit of
        the communities in buffer areas would ensure the conservation of the PA's is defined and
        ratified. These communities would become true human barriers to prevent the entry and
        intervention of other communities or persons.

iv)     However, although it was not a commitment of the SNAP-GEF project, it is
        acknowledged that certain advances and connections have been made for financing and
        implementing several projects for the communities. First, activities or enterprises that
        provide direct support to the communities involved have taken place through the
        PRODERENA project (whose counterpart is MAE) for CCER communities, and
        agencies like ECOLAP of the Universidad San Francisco, and Conservation
        International, CI, for the Machalilla National Park. Self-sustaining projects that are in
        progress under SNAP-GEF are also noted. For example, the demarcation project that has
        been carried out in two areas (high and low) of CCER, and the biodiversity monitoring
        project that was implemented in the two selected areas.

v)      It was also confirmed that the persons involved in the midterm evaluation had great
        expectations that productive proposals to guarantee certain income stability for the
        communities inside PA's and in buffer zones would be included in the new CCER
        Management Plan and in the MNP Administrative Plan. Statements by several members
        of the administrative committees regarding the results of these plans have also been
        confirmed. Several, including members of the Cuellaje administrative committee,
        intended to request reforms or even reject proposed Management Plans if they did not
        fulfill          the          expectation            of         the          communities.
        The Cuellaje case is probably linked to the mining conflict and their expectations that the
        MP (management plan) would propose solutions to that conflict. It should be noted,




                                                 51

         however, that the MP of CCER and the AP (administrative plan) of MNP contain profiles
         that could later become possible projects.

vi)      Under these circumstances, it can be seen that the task of preparing projects based on the
         profiles identified in the management and administrative plans is in the hands of MAE,
         through the persons responsible for areas and regional offices. The following are some of
         the items with potential to be productive proposals with the participation of the
         communities from the PA buffer zones, some of which match the themes that are
         indicated in the profiles of the Management Plans i) aquaculture projects, ii) small
         hydroelectric projects, iii) ecotourism and community tourism, iv) agro forestation, v)
         proposals involving environmental services, and vi) in general, proposals that involve
         agro productive chains that include value added.

SNAP Strategic Plan

The Strategic Plan was formulated with four thematic axes: i) Completeness, ii) Governance and
Institutionality, iii) Social participation, and iv) Financial sustainability. The structure of the plan
contains a complete assessment of the current conservation situation of SNAP, and identifies at
least 11 structural problems for which strategies are established, and it defines the expected or
recommended situations in a log frame format. The expected situation is defined as the hopes for
SNAP functioning over the next 10 years. All work and proposals of the plan are defined
according to three scenarios or desired situations: Ceiling, assuming that the proposed objectives
are met; Intermediate, where the current situation has improved; and Floor, where the current
situation has worsened. Each option identifies simple and combined quantitative and qualitative
variables for constructing the proposed scenarios.

The SP (Strategic Plan) of SNAP is recognized as a modern tool that might be the best
contribution of the SNAP-GEF project. It is a complete, published product, but it has not yet been
legalized officially. Due to the national importance of this tool, it is hoped that it will be legalized
by means of an Executive Decree, the text of which has been sent to the President of the
Republic.

Although it is not yet official, the SP has been adopted and empowered by MAE, and is in fact
being used for several official purposes, especially as a reference for the preparation of
international projects and alliances for the conservation of protected areas. For example, the
German Cooperation is using it as a reference for preparing a 7 million euro project. Other
NGO's and UNDP are designing projects for SNAP based on the SP.

A complete consensus has been detected among stakeholders and beneficiaries about the
usefulness of the SNAP Strategic Plan; the information in the assessment is up to date and will
serve as a starting point for designing possible National Conservation Policies to complement the
existing ones.

CCER Management Plan and MNP Administrative Plan

Like the SNAP SP, the preparation and publication of the CCER Management Plan and the MNP
Administrative Plan are considered finished projects. The view of the majority of the stakeholders
and beneficiaries regarding these tools is very positive, especially the direct beneficiaries (MAE
stakeholders), in this case, the persons responsible for PA's, including park rangers. The view of
several stakeholders and persons involved outside MAE is also positive. There is general



                                                   52

agreement that these documents are a significant contribution to all future activities involving the
conservation of these selected PA's.

It is acknowledged that the MNP Administrative Plan is useful as a source of information and
support for several proposals that involve conservation alliances and interventions. For example,
there is the marine tourism project proposed by ECOLAP of the Universidad San Francisco;
Conservation International, CI, has also arranged several activities to support MNP including
programs for Community Development, Scientific Research, Tourism and Recreation,
Interpretation, Education, Training, and Administration. The Italian-Ecuadorian External Debt
Exchange Fund could support environmental management, community development and applied
research programs. All these projects have been prepared, or will be developed, using the
information from the new MNP Administrative Plan for support and justification. These and other
projects are included in the text of the Administrative Plan in a chapter on identifying funds that
could support MNP conservation initiatives.

The direct beneficiaries and persons involved in the CCER Management Plan also have the same
perception. Although previous Management Plans were not available, the usefulness of the tool is
recognized, especially because of its up to date assessment information. In this case, there is no
financial support has been offered for conservation activities as was the case of MNP; however,
initiatives that are in progress under the PRODERENA project are based on and supported by the
Management Plan. There is a portfolio of profiles that could become projects requiring funding.
These are classified in a scheme of Macro Projects, and are as follows: Administration, Control
and Monitoring Program; Participatory Planning Program; Financial Sustainability Program;
Community Development and Environmental Education Program; Tourism and Recreation
Program; and Research, Natural Resources Management and Environmental Monitoring
Program.

An exception, however, is the dissatisfaction by the population groups that make up the Cuellaje
administrative committee. They had hoped that the CCER MP would include solutions to the
mining conflict in that area; however, the area of the mining concession is in fact outside the
boundaries of the protected area; in other words, the entire area of the concession is in the buffer
zone of the Reserve where other Government agencies have jurisdiction and must help resolve the
conflict.

Evaluation of the management efficiency of the selected PA's

The evaluation of the management efficiency of the selected PA's is something the project has
been doing almost since the beginning of the implementation. The stakeholders recognize that
this theme is a new strategy or tool for improving the administration of PA's.

Based on that evidence, the administrators of the evaluation, stakeholders from the two protected
areas, MNP and CCER, and officers from the central office of MAE acknowledge that this is an
important contribution of the project for defining and correcting possible weaknesses in
conservation management. It is noted and acknowledged that the methodology that was applied,
being a proven methodology, provides a high degree of confidence in the results. There is also
agreement among the stakeholders that it is very feasible that this experience could be applied in
an extensive manner to evaluate the administration of other SNAP protected areas.

Most of the persons asked expect the results of the two experiences to be published and socialized
nationally, especially among the persons in charge of all PA's, and persons responsible for
inspection, to provide an opportunity for reflection and improvement of PA management..


                                                 53

Staff training

The training proposal called "Education and training program for MAE personnel working in
SNAP in Ecuador in the areas of Planning, Environmental Management and Financial
Management," was implemented to a level of approximately 70%. The items implemented
involved the emergency training plan for the project and included the following priority themes:
i) English Training for central office staff carried out by the World Street Institute ii) Training in
Conflict Resolution techniques given by ECOLAP and the Universidad de San Francisco for
officers from the central office and 9 protected areas of SNAP, iii)Training in the use and
application of Microsoft Project for staff from the central office and regional offices, and courses
in Microsoft Office for park rangers; both were given by the CEC Training Center of the
Politecnica Nacional, iv) Environmental Legislation course for officers from the two selected
protected areas and from the respective regional offices; the project also completed a proposal for
providing training in protected area management that was socialized among possible
beneficiaries. This complementary training program is for MAE personnel and is given in four
levels according to the possible beneficiaries: Management, Technical, Operational and
Administrative Personnel, which are the four components of the plan. The macro themes to be
covered in each component are training in planning, in administrative and financial management,
in environmental management, and in socio-cultural matters.

As was mentioned above, this theme was met with obvious acceptance and pleasure by the
stakeholders and beneficiaries of the project; unfortunately, it could not be implemented in its
entirety due to time limitations.

Proposal for the concession and co-management of services

The contribution of the project in this area included work on two specific proposals: the
concession process for infrastructure and ecotourism services in the El Boliche National
Recreation Area, and co-management of the tourism infrastructure at Cuicocha (the high area of
CCER).

This is an interesting and decisive contribution to the future administration of SNAP, and is
especially recognized by DBAPVS and the MAE central office managers. It is acknowledged and
accepted that these types of mechanisms could be the solution for relieving pressure and
administrative weaknesses in several SNAP processes and services. It is also seen that these
processes show how to relieve MAE officers of the administration of these services and receiving
visitors, and will allow them to dedicate their time to conservation activities.

Of these two processes, the co-management of Cuicocha has possibilities to reach fruition. In this
case, the Gorky Campusano self-guided trail around Lake Cuicocha, the Interpretation Center,
and the Administrative Building will be co-managed. The terms of reference have been developed
for the bidding competition and the process has begun with a public invitation in the press. It is
hoped that prior to the end of the project, the bids can be opened and evaluated.

However, there were certain worries and questions by stakeholders from the high area of CCER.
They say that the successful bidder will have certain difficulties managing the visitors because
according to the current flow in effect at the facilities, the route the visitors take does not include
the interpretation center. If this continues, the successful bidder would possibly not have a
sufficient flow of visitors to keep the service active. A possible corrective measure for this
concern would be to regulate the flow of visitors in the area and make it obligatory to visit the


                                                  54

interpretation center. Another concern involves the fees. These are not part of the concession and
thus there will be no incentive for bidders. No possible solution was seen in this case, because
entrance fees to protected areas by law are income for MAE and become state funds that cannot
be shared with any private company.

In the case of the El Boliche Recreational Area, the pre-contractual conditions of the project have
been defined, prepared and approved, but due to lack of time, the concession process of the
Project could not be completed, and its continuation is in the hands of MAE.

Tools for facilitating self-management of the system of protected areas

The project supported and developed several activities in this process, and all were directed
toward supporting and creating the conditions necessary to facilitate SNAP self-management. The
principal contribution of the project was the development of mechanisms for generating income
in addition to the budget for self-sustained management of PA's. At the end of the project, the
stakeholders and beneficiaries acknowledged that significant contributions have been made
regarding this matter.

The principal contributions of the project to facilitate SNAP self-management processes include
the following:

i)       SNAP financial sustainability strategy is a finished project and will possibly need an
         additional socialization stage to ensure the details of its application.
ii)      SNAP marketing strategy that is essentially a proposal that determines the level of
         interest companies have in donating toward the conservation of natural areas in Ecuador.
iii)     SNAP Information System that is an appropriate tool for improving the services of
         DBAPVS and the selected protected areas.
iv)      SNAP Administrative and Financial Management System that is undoubtedly another
         tool that the project has provided as a finished project, which will help improve the
         management of these two processes and will produce an improvement in the services and
         thus in the income of SNAP.
v)       Concession and co-management processes for PA services to free DBAPVS officers from
         having to manage the services, to allow them more time for conservation activities.
vi)      Economic appraisal of the contributions of protected areas, which essentially proposes
         that the monetary and non monetary contributions of protected areas to the family, local,
         regional and national economy be evaluated, and that the opportunity costs of populations
         in protected areas and buffer zones be determined.

All the processes and activities mentioned are contributions that are acknowledged by the
beneficiaries (MAE officers and managers). They agree that this will be a decisive contribution
toward the future management of SNAP. However, it should be noted that contradictory and
rather pessimistic criteria have also been encountered. Some DBAPVS officers feel that the
search for opportunities to make conservation self-sustaining could be counterproductive, since
there is a risk that the Government could ignore its responsibilities, and persons responsible for
PA's could dedicate their efforts to seeking income generating options and neglect conservation
activities. In addition to these positions, contrary opinions were also heard. Some defend the need
to demonstrate the profitability (in economic terms) of conserving the SNAP natural resources.
There will be no way to justify conservation or at least it will be difficult to sustain, if the value of
what is conserved is not demonstrated. Perhaps the most outstanding aspect of this analysis was
its contribution to the matter of an economic appraisal of the services provided by SNAP.



                                                   55

SNAP Financial Management System (SAG-SNAP)

This is another contribution of the project and is presented as an administrative and financial tool
for managing protected areas. The system was designed to optimize the administrative and
financial processes of protected areas, make up to date information available, and standardize
documents, forms and processes.

The stakeholders and beneficiaries noted the usefulness of this administrative tool in the several
aspects, but the likelihood that the system will allow administrative and financial processes to be
decentralized is significant. The system will also allow the generation of uniform criteria for
financial management and systematic monitoring of investments by the Government and other
donors.

However, although the system has been implemented in at least nine protected areas, it is only
operational at four sites, the Central Office, and Podocarpus National Park in the regional districts
of Pichincha and Loja. It should be noted that there is justifiable concern by some stakeholders,
especially MAE stakeholders. They feel that due to a lack of proper infrastructure and equipment,
the system will not operate properly in many regional offices and protected areas, especially those
outside the reach of Internet networks.

SNAP financial sustainability strategy

This proposal defines the guidelines for SNAP financial management, and since it is part of the
SP, it has been developed for a period that will extend to 2016. A diagnostic study of the current
state of conservation financing in protected areas provided the basis for preparing this proposal.

The proposal contains the following specific objectives: To seek strategies for increasing the
government's financial contribution to the budget of SNAP; To generate a regulatory framework
that will permit the participation of the private sector and communities to be promoted; To
position SNAP as a strategic sector for the economic development of the country, and To
strengthen managerial skills in the National Environmental Authority, in this case, DBAPVS, for
administering the National Areas Heritage of Ecuador, PANE.

The Financial Sustainability Strategy contains at least the following six priority lines of action: i)
To increase the contribution of public funds by orienting Government investment toward
conservation, ii) To propose that mechanisms and opportunities for generating self-management
resources be diversified, iii) To improve the management of available resources by promoting
cost reductions and efficient expenditure, iv) To seek mechanisms for capitalizing the Protected
Area Fund, FAP, v) To establish alliances that generate benefits for participating communities
and strengthen their commitment to conservation, and vi) To encourage national and international
voluntary contributions (individuals and legal entities)

Improvement of infrastructure and equipment

The project made its contribution in the two selected areas (MNP and CCER), and provided
specific assistance to the Cuyabeno Wildlife Production Reserve, and the MAE Central Office.
Inspection facilities and control posts, the interpretation center, and tourism areas in MNP were
improved with equipment and signs, including improvements to the inspection post on Isla de la
Plata. In the high area of CCER, assistance was provided for control and inspection post
infrastructure, interpretive paths were improved, and signs, tourist sites, interpretation centers,
etc., were modernized. Equipment was also provided for control and inspection posts. A high


                                                 56

level of satisfaction was perceived regarding the support received for infrastructure and
equipment in these two areas.

In the low area of CCER, although the provision for equipment for control and inspections posts
was acknowledged, the displeasure of MAE stakeholders was evident (persons responsible for
administering the AP and staff from the regional office in Esmeraldas). They say the project has
not helped provide infrastructure for control posts. The perception of these apparently injured
parties is that decisions were made that prevented their infrastructure from being provided.
However, the project managers' version is that due to the instability of the area manager, and
considering that during the implementation of the project, at least three area managers passed
through the position, it was not possible to submit the necessary technical specifications in a
timely manner and carry out the required infrastructure improvements, and the need to make
those improvements was also not obvious. As a result, once the specifications were agreed to, the
times set for the selection process by the Committee of Contracts and Purchasing (CCA) were
very short, and it was not possible to award the contract to the supplier.

In addition to the difficulty with providing infrastructure, which remains as a deficiency, there is
also the matter of the burning of the control post at Borbon in the low area of CCER; it is really
an irreparable loss, since documentation and files relating to the administration of the AP were
destroyed. Thus, the rebuilding of this control post is added to the infrastructure needs, which of
course are not the responsibility of the project, since no funds were included for new
infrastructure.

The feeling of the persons responsible for the AP is general frustration, because they say they
received equipment but not infrastructure in which to install the equipment. The only option for
resolving this situation is for MAE to find a source of extra funds, or to incorporate into its own
budget the necessary economic resources for improving the infrastructure at the three control
posts in the lower area of CCER, which are Naranjito, Alto Tambo, and Playa de Oro.

Regarding the project's contribution for transportation and mobilization facilities, the delivery of
4 x 4 vehicles, motorcycles and canoes was timely and effective; these will be used for
administrative activities in the selected PA's, and monitoring, control and inspection activities.

Systematization and dissemination of the experiences of the project

Although the project did not have a direct commitment for systematizing the results and
experiences, it should be noted, however, that the project constantly systematized and published
technical documents such as reports, studies, progress reports, consultants' reports, etc. Several
documents were produced at the end of the project that are developed systems and completed
processes which, being official documents or products of the project, were, or will be published
for dissemination to the beneficiaries.

In the chapter, "Bibliography", there is a detailed description of most of the information
generated by the project. Some of these documents may remain as technical reports, but others
necessarily have been published for distribution to the public, or are being printed for distribution
to users. The following documents, among others, have been edited for official publication:
SNAP Strategic Plan, CCER Management Plan, MNP Administrative Plan, DBAPVS Training
Plan, Assessment of the Machalilla National Park, Management Plan for the El Boliche National
Recreation Area, the SNAP Financial Sustainability Strategy, and the MNP and CCER
Management Efficiency Evaluation.



                                                 57

A Pamphlet was also published on Administrative Committees that reports on the process of
strengthening these committees. The goal is to socialize the matter among the members of the
committees themselves. All the documents that were edited and published will constitute the
"Documented contribution of the project," and in addition to serving as work tools for the direct
beneficiaries of the project, they will be available for specialized institutions and even for the
general public.

The criterion of some MAE officers is that it would be desirable for the project to consider a
specific systematization study to summarize all the accumulated experience of the project. The
project findings and lessons learned could be highlighted and documented in the study and made
available to the public in a summarized form. However, it should be mentioned that this
document is being prepared and will be part of the final report. Several project participants have
stated that this systematization would have helped to overcome past experiences. There have been
projects with important results, but due to the lack of documentation and distribution, many
results have remained in the files, or have been little used by the beneficiaries.

SNAP SIG Information System

The contribution of the project in this case was the development of the SNAP Geo-Referenced
Information System with SIG-ON LINE applications and with local and Internet access, which
can be implemented in the different SNAP protected areas. It has at least five subcomponents,
each with a series of internal processes and activities that help make the system a complete tool
and, to a certain degree, universally applicable for managing SNAP. The SIG subsystems are: i)
Administration of SIG SNAP, ii) SNAP Information, iii) Planning instruments, iv) Institutional
management processes, and v) SNAP maps.

There is general agreement among the stakeholders and beneficiaries about the importance of
implementing the SNAP Information System. Several mentioned the importance of the following
aspects of the system: i) It will provide an opportunity to document and disseminate guides,
forms, procedures and other work tools to persons involved in conservation. ii) It will be an
opportunity to disseminate the experiences and results of the projects and highlight the
conservation work of MAE. iii) It will be an opportunity to disseminate regulations, restrictions,
agreements and regulations that are issued by MAE or DBAPVS. iv) The information system will
also be a planning, follow up, and monitoring tool for MAE or DBAPVS activities.

However, some MAE stakeholders were concerned that the system will have to prioritize the
information before making it available on the system. They believe that not all the information is
suitable for free distribution to the public, so there will have to be a justified classification of the
information in order to determine which information is restricted in nature, and which is freely
available. In all likelihood, this is a task for MAE, through DBAPVS; even if it does not classify
the information, it will have to regulate the process to avoid problems.

Products most valued by beneficiaries and applicability of the products

The responses to following two specific questions were tabulated based on fieldwork and
especially interviews with key persons:

a. Mention two of the most outstanding contributions or products of the SNAP-GEF
Project. The responses assigned the following order of priority to the following products:

 SNAP Strategic Plan


                                                  58

 Strengthening social participation and the establishing administrative committees
 The new CCER Management Plan was valued by local stakeholders from this protected area,
     and the MNP Administrative Plan was valued by local stakeholders from Manabi.
 Interactive and participatory work with stakeholders, especially with MAE officers.
 Infrastructure and equipment that was received is valued especially by stakeholders from the
     protected areas of CCER (high area) and MNP.

b. Give your opinion about the applicability of the results or products of the SNAP-GEF
Project.

The responses were mostly in agreement that the applicability of the results would depend on the
degree of commitment of MAE itself, through DBAPVS. Several officers that were interviewed
believed that the applicability will depend on obtaining additional support (for example of a GEF-
III), that would be prepared with the direct participation of the persons involved and would have
the primary objective of applying the projects that are generated, and the continuity of actions
carried out by the SNAP-GEF Project.

2. Evaluation of Performance Indicators

Indicator: The National System of Protected Areas is able to efficiently protect ecosystems of
world importance and conserve the biodiversity found in two selected protected areas through
the efficient implementation of management plans

Management Plan of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve (100% fulfilled)

The Management Plan of the Cotacachi Cayapas Reserve was designed and developed during
2006 and 2007 as a technical planning instrument for managing the Reserve. It contained the
principles, guidelines and standards for ensuring harmonious coexistence between the rational use
of the resources, goods and services the Reserve generates, and the conservation of the
biodiversity and ecosystems of the Reserve.

The Management Plan of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve was formalized by means of
a Ministerial Resolution of the Minister of Environment of Ecuador.

Preparation of the Management Plan of the Machalilla National Park (100% fulfilled)




                                                 60

The Management Plan of the Machalilla National Park was prepared during 2006 and 2007. This
plan is a guide for the participatory, effective, technical, administrative and financial management
of the park over the next three years by the Ministry of Environment, communities, sectional
governments, fishing sector and tourism, and it will contribute to the achievement of its objective
of conserving the biodiversity of the park.

The Management Plan of the Machalilla National Park was formalized by means of a Ministerial
Resolution of the Minister of Environment of Ecuador.

Indicator: Local communities in and around the selected protected areas participate actively
and with a commitment to the protected areas through the creation and operation of
participatory management committees.

Strengthening participatory mechanisms (100% fulfilled)

Management Committees for the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve and the Machalilla
National Park were created during the implementation of the Project to coordinate, concentrate
and support the management of the reserves. Their primary function is to ensure that protected
areas are conserved by strengthening the participation of local stakeholders that are involved with
the protected areas.

The Management Committee of the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve was created by means
of Ministerial Resolution No. 180 that was published in the Official Gazette No. 180 on April 16,
2007.

The Management Committee of the Machalilla National Park was created by means of a
Ministerial Resolution that was published in the Official Gazette No. 12 on January 31, 2007.

To complement the creation of the Management Committees, the Project implemented plans for
strengthening the Management Committees of the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve and the
Machalilla National Park.

Indicator: The Department of Biodiversity and Protected Areas of the Ministry of Environment
will be able to assign resources, control, monitor and supervise the National System of
Protected Areas (100% fulfilled).

The Project helped develop a computerized Management Information System so that the National
Department of Biodiversity and Protected Areas could control, supervise and monitor the legal
and financial administration of 9 Protected Areas and 10 Regional Districts of the National
System of Protected Areas of the Ministry of Environment.

The information system known as SAG  SNAP is currently operating on the Ministry of
Environment Web Page. Its objective is to support the decentralization of administrative
processes that affect the financing of protected areas with regard to research, tourism and
infractions. To utilize this computerized system, computers of the latest generation were
purchased for the National Department of Biodiversity, Protected Areas and Wildlife and nine
selected protected areas.

Staff from the National Department of Biodiversity, Protected Areas and Wildlife, Regional
Districts, and protected areas was also trained in the use of the SAG-SNAP computerized system.



                                                   61

The Project also helped to develop the capacity of personnel and technical staff of the National
Department of Biodiversity, Protected Areas and Wildlife, and protected areas of the National
System of Natural Areas, by designing a formal and non-formal education program in planning,
environmental management, and financial management based on an updated assessment of the
training needs of Ministry of Environment personnel involved in administering and managing
protected areas in the National System of Protected Areas, within the context of environmental
policies, the National Biodiversity Strategy, processes in progress, and staff functions.

Based on a training needs assessment and design, a training program in computers (MS Office
and MS Project), conflict resolution, and English was implemented.

Indicator: A gradual and permanent increase in the non-budgetary income of the National
System of Protected Areas (SNAP) (100% fulfilled)

To fulfill this indicator, the Project developed a Financial Sustainability Strategy for SNAP that
helped achieve objective 6 of the Strategic Plan of SNAP (2007-2016): "To attain the long term
financial sustainability of the Natural Areas Heritage of the Country and develop financial
mechanisms for managing other SNAP subsystems." To achieve this, the Project supported the
following studies and consultancies:

 Development of a financial sustainability Strategy for SNAP, which is a process lead by the
    Ministry of Environment that seeks to increase financing between 2007 and 2016, provide
    administrative structure to ensure the effective management of SNAP, and strengthen
    participatory social involvement in the management of the Country's natural areas.
 Preparation of an Economic Assessment of SNAP Goods and Services that support the
    financial sustainability of the National System of Protected Areas by seeking new income
    alternatives for services that are provided by protected areas.
 Structuring of the Fiduciary Fund "Natural Areas Heritage of the Country." The purpose of
    the Fiduciary Fund is to administer self-management resources for services that are provided
    by the Natural Areas Heritage of the Country  excluding the Galapagos Marine Reserve and
    National Park  as well as donations and other contributions that are obtained in the future for
    investment in the administration and management of protected areas.
 A technical study for promulgating a permit for levying and collecting a differentiated
    authorization fee for occupying, building or maintaining telecommunications infrastructure,
    or installing antennas in the Natural Areas Heritage of the Country (PANE).

Indicator: Concessions for services in regulated areas, completely tested in the two selected
areas (100% fulfilled)

Technical assistance during the concession process for tourism infrastructure and services in the
El Boliche National Recreation Area, including: the identification of the selected area, the
establishment of an Oversight Committee inside the Ministry of Environment of Ecuador to
accompany the process, the review of pre-contractual bidding documents, and updating of the
economic-financial study of the concession project.

The pilot Concession for tourism infrastructure and services in the El Boliche National
Recreation Area includes the identification of services, preparation of legal instruments,
development of selection criteria, and preparation of bidding competition documents.




                                                 62

Another important contribution of the Project was the development of legal instruments to allow
income to be generated for the proper management of selected protected areas and the promotion
of co-management and participation by stakeholders involved in decision making for selected
protected areas. This was how the co-management process began at Lake Cuicocha in the
Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve; the co-management process also began at the Los Frailes
Recreational Center in Machalilla National Park.

Indicator: Updated strategy of the National System of Protected Areas

Updating of the Strategic Plan of the National System of Protected Areas (100% fulfilled)

The Strategic Plan was updated in 2006 using sustainable development as the guideline for the
management and administration of the protected areas of the country. It is a quick and flexible
tool for effectively guiding the efforts of the Environmental Authority and civil society in
managing the National System of Protected Natural Areas, optimizing the use of technical,
material and economic resources, and periodically evaluating the progress achieved between 2007
and 2016.

The updated Strategic Plan of the National System of Protected Areas was formalized by means
of Ministerial Resolution No. 009 of the Minister of Environment of Ecuador on February 8,
2008.

Indicator: A monitoring and evaluation system to ensure the efficient management of SNAP in
selected Areas (100% fulfilled)


The Monitoring and Evaluation System of the project included the following activities:

 Evaluation of project beneficiaries based on the evaluation of Project beneficiaries in
    components 1, 2 and 4.
 Development of a methodology for evaluating management efficiency in two selected
    protected areas.
 Consultancy for monitoring biodiversity in protected areas (PNM y RECC)

3. Evaluation of the Fulfillment of components and activities

Component 1: Institutional and legal strengthening

Activity: Updating of the SNAP Strategic Plan within the institutional framework of the
Ministry of Environment of Ecuador.

Result: A regulatory framework for promoting the integral management of SNAP through the
involvement of stakeholders in the management of protected areas, given the importance of
conserving biological diversity and protected areas as elements that contribute to the sustainable
development of the country.

An evaluation of the beneficiaries of the SNAP Strategic Plan Project shows that the
implementation of the plan will be a starting point for designing possible National Conservation
Policies that will strengthen existing policies.




                                                63

Activity: Development of a system for the financial and administrative management of
SNAP

Result: The computerized system is operating on the Ministry of Environment web page and its
purpose is to support the decentralization of administrative processes that involve the financing of
protected areas regarding research, tourism and infractions.

Activity: Financial Sustainability Strategy for SNAP

Result: The Financial Sustainability Strategy for SNAP helped achieve objective 6 of the
Strategic Plan of SNAP (2007-2016): "To attain the long term financial sustainability of the
Natural Areas Heritage of the Country and develop financial mechanisms for managing other
SNAP subsystems".

To achieve and strengthen the Strategy of Financial Sustainability, the following sub activities
were carried out:

Financial strategies were developed for SNAP and two selected protected areas.

An Economic Assessment of the Goods and Services of SNAP was prepared.

The "Natural Areas Heritage of the Country" Fiduciary Fund was structured in order to
administer self-management funds from the services provided by the Natural Areas Heritage of
the Country  excluding the Galapagos Marine Reserve and National Park  as well as donations
and other contributions that may be received in the future for investment in the administration and
management of protected areas.

A differentiated fee was established for authorizations to occupy, build and maintain
telecommunications infrastructure, or install antennas in the Natural Area Heritage sites of the
Country.

Co-management of the infrastructure and services at Lake Cuicocha in the Cotacachi-Cayapas
Ecological Reserve and at Los Frailes in the Machalilla National Park to strengthen sustainable
tourism development in protected areas and ensure that biodiversity is conserved.

Activity: Concession of services in protected areas

Implementation of the concession process for tourism infrastructure and services in the El
Boliche National Recreation Area. This is a pilot concession involving tourism infrastructure and
services in the El Boliche National Recreation Area involving the identification of services,
preparation of legal instruments, development of selection criteria, and preparation of bidding
competition documents.

To implement the pilot concession process, assistance was provided for updating the
Management Plan of the El Boliche National Recreation Area, which served as the basis for
planning the management of the area. The Plan was formalized by means of a Ministerial
Resolution that will be published in the Official Gazette.



                                                 64

Activity: Developing the capacity of personnel for planning, environmental management,
and financial management

A training program was designed for the technical staff of the National Department of
Biodiversity, Protected Areas and Wildlife, and selected protected areas in order to improve their
skills in planning, environmental management and financial management to enhance the
management of protected areas.

Component 2: Participatory management of selected protected areas (Cotacachi-Cayapas
Ecological Reserve and Machalilla National Park)

Activity: Design of the Management Plan of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve.

Result: The Management Plan of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve was completed, and
will provide a tool for updated management and control by Ministry of Environment officers and
local stakeholders over the next 5 years.

Based on an evaluation, the beneficiaries and persons involved agree that the plan is a very useful
tool, especially given the updated information contained in the assessment.

Activity: Design of the Management Plan of the Machalilla National Park

Result: The Management Plan of the Machalilla National Park was completed and will serve as a
guide for the participatory, effective, technical, administrative and financial management of the
park over the next three years, and help to achieve its conservation objectives.

Based on an evaluation, the beneficiaries and persons involved agree that this plan will provide
information and support for several partnership proposals and interventions that will foster the
conservation of biodiversity in the Park.

Activity: Strengthening of participatory mechanisms

Result: Management Committees were established for the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve
and the Machalilla National Park as organizations for social participation by local stakeholders
who will provide definitive administrative support and ensure that the protected areas are
conserved.

Management committees strengthen the active participation of local stakeholders involved with
protected areas to promote their conservation.

Activity: Assessment of the Machalilla National Park (PNM)

Result: The updated Assessment of the Machalilla National Park involved the following
activities: an assessment of the utilization of PNM marine resources, detailed marine cartography
of areas of importance to PNM, an update of current PNM land and marine management areas, a
definition of the priority elements of PNM biological and cultural diversity, a juridical analysis of
the current legal framework and the political and institutional situation of the administration and



                                                 65

management of PNM, and a participatory situational analysis of PNM, which will permit this
study to be a tool that supports the implementation of the Management Plan of PNM.

Activity: Effectiveness of the Cuicocha Interpretation Center in the Cotacachi Cayapas
Reserve

Result: To increase the effectiveness of the interpretation center, the project improved the
existing infrastructure of the Cotacachi Cayapas Reserve and purchased several items of
equipment, leading to a substantial increase in the effectiveness of the center for managing
tourism sustainability in the reserve.

Activity: Implementation of the Management Plan of the Machalilla National Park

Result: During the implementation of the Management Plan of the Machalilla National Park, the
project helped improve the infrastructure of the Park and purchased several assets and items of
equipment that helped to ensure that this activity was the most valued by the stakeholders that are
involved in conserving the biodiversity of the Machalilla National Park.

Activity: Implementation of a Control and Monitoring Program in the Machalilla National
Park, the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve and the Cuyabeno Wildlife Production
Reserve

Result: The Project improved the facilities of control and monitoring posts, modernized signs and
labeling, and assisted with the purchase of equipment and assets such as vehicles, outboard
motors, and field equipment, thus substantially improving the control and monitoring activities in
protected areas.

Component 4: Monitoring and Evaluation

Activity: Coordination of the Project

Result: The Coordination of the Project included several activities that were carried out in order
to fulfill the indicators of the donation agreement. These activities were:

Preparation of the Operations Manual of the Project, the Purchasing Plan of the Project, the POA,
monthly and semiannual reports, and tools and methodologies that were used to systematize the
process.

A project monitoring and evaluation system was implemented using MS Project and data that
were updated periodically.

Technical assistance was provided to the National Department of Biodiversity on matters relating
to the management and administration of Protected Areas, and the implementation of studies that
were contracted by the Project.

A study evaluating the beneficiaries was submitted to the World Bank, which demonstrated the
high degree of satisfaction of the stakeholders involved in protected areas due to support that was
provided by the project for strengthening the conservation of Biodiversity in the areas.

Activity: SNAP Information System



                                                 66

Result: The project developed a Geo-referenced Information System for SNAP with SIG ON
LINE applications and local and Internet access. The implementation of this system has provided
the following: i) documentation and dissemination of guides, forms, experiences, results,
regulations, restrictions, procedures and other work tools for stakeholders that support
conservation, ii) a planning tool that also controls and monitors Ministry of Environment and the
Department of Biodiversity activities.

Activity: Evaluation of the efficiency of protected area management

Result: A methodology developed for evaluating the efficiency of the management of two
selected protected areas was applied with the assistance of technical personnel from the
Department of Biodiversity and Persons Responsible for the protected areas. As a result, the
efficiency and performance of each protected area was improved.

Activity: Monitoring biodiversity in protected areas (PNM and RECC)

Result: The Project helped carry out a consultancy to monitor biodiversity in protected areas
(PNM and RECC). This document has become a consultation tool because of the up-to-date
information it contains, and the indicators it generates to provide information about the
conservation status of these protected areas.

4. Evidence of a Government commitment to the sustainability of Project activities

Through the Ministry of Environment, the Government of Ecuador has taken the following
actions, which are obvious commitments to the sustainability of the SNAP-GEF Project:

 The updated Strategic Plan of the National System of Protected Areas was formalized by
    means of Ministerial Resolution No. 009 of the Minister of Environment of Ecuador on
    February 8, 2008, making it part of the National Development Plan of the country.

 The management committees of the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve and the
    Machalilla National Park were created by means of Ministerial Resolutions that were
    published in Official Gazettes No. 12 and 64 respectively, and are actively accompanying the
    Responsible Persons in each Area.

 Several actions by the Ministry of Environment to ensure that proposals involving the
    Fiduciary Fund, co-management and concessions that were implemented by the Department
    of Biodiversity with the support of the Project are implemented by means of Ministerial
    Resolutions and are included in the Operating Plans of the Department of Biodiversity.

 Total support for the dissemination of the products generated by the project among other
    related stakeholders (strategic allies) so that they can be implemented with the technical and
    financial support of the Ministry of Environment.

5. Evaluation of the performance of the World Bank in supervising the Project

From the perspective of the persons involved in the project, the World Bank played an important
role because the Bank's experience in supervising similar projects in Ecuador ensured that this
project would be implemented.




                                                 67

The participation of the World Bank involved the following actions:
 Support in achieving the indicators of the Donation Agreement.
 Timely approval of terms of reference that were prepared for consultancies and the hiring of
    individual consultants.
 Assistance with purchasing processes and the hiring of consultants
 Prior, rapid, and timely review of processes before awarding contracts.
 Periodic reviews and supervision of project progress and performance based on the indicators
    of the agreement.
 Reviews subsequent to contracting processes to ensure transparency in the implementation of
    those processes.
 Technical and administrative support for linking the project to NGOs, thus strengthening
    actions taken for the conservation of Biodiversity.

Based on the above, it is evident that the World Bank's performance in supervising the project
resulted in the proper execution of the project in accordance with the provisions of the Donation
Agreement.

6. Evaluation of MAE performance in executing the Project

The Ministry of Environment executed the project in the following manner:

The technical implementation of the project was carried out with the support of technical
personnel from the National Department of Biodiversity, and project technical staff under the
supervision of the Project Coordinator. From a technical standpoint, the performance of the
Ministry created no problems during the execution.

Financial management was the responsibility of the National Environmental Fund until December
2005, and then in January 2006, the Project Coordinating Unit (UCP) of the Ministry of
Environment took charge of the financial administration of the resources of the project, under the
supervision of the Project Coordinator who authorized all expenses.

There were no problems with the administration of resources by the Environmental Fund;
however the most critical problem with the UCP was the turnover of the unit Coordinators, who
were in their posts for at most six months. Had it not been for this problem, the project could have
achieved 100% performance.

B. FAN: Component 3:

Scope

The purpose of this document is to present some reflections and considerations as a result of the
implementation of the GEF Project National System of Protected Areas which was implemented
by the Ministry of the Environment of Ecuador and Fondo Ambiental Nacional, this entity
responsible for component No. 3 "Financial Sustainability" of the project under grant TF051486.

This document is indented to provide a perspective from Fondo Ambiental Nacional and is
annexed to the Final Report of the Project submitted by the World Bank as implementing agency
for GEF.




                                                68

The executive document presents an analysis of the key output indicators of the project, how they
were achieved, and then factors that were critical in the overall results of the Project. The
document also addresses some other interesting results which were not forth seen at the start of
the Project but which are important enough to highlight in this report. The document concludes
wit specific references to the sustainability of Project's objectives, and with some further
considerations, and potentialities for the future.

Key output indicators and performance

The outcomes for this project under this component were:

           i.    Capitalization of the protected Areas Fund (FAP) to $12 million before 2006, and
          ii.    That FAP supports 20% of all the basic operational costs of the National System
                 of Protected Areas (SNAP)

It should be noted that both outcomes were successfully achieved, below a brief analysis of the
key factors that were critical towards the achievement of the outcomes:

Capitalization of the protected Areas Fund (FAP) to $12 million before 2006

   i.   The design of FAP included the best practices of Funds alike, and many of the lessons
        learned from implementation of such Funds from other organizations in Latin America
        and the Caribbean who are funding basic operational expenses in Protected Areas.

  ii    This project and particularly the "sustainable financing" component were designed with
        the active participation of other entities who has also interest in financing Protected Areas,
        such is the case of the Cooperation from the Republic of Germany. The $4 million
        needed to reach the outcome came from a second debt for nature swap between Ecuador
        and Germany. It should be noted that prior to this Project, Germany had never
        contributed to an endowment fund for Protected Areas. The $4 million was the second
        time in which out of a debt for nature swap the amounts agreed went in to the endowment
        fund of FAP. So this factor has a lot to do with the interest of other stakeholders in FAP,
        including of course the Government of Ecuador through the Ministry of the Environment
        which spearheaded the negotiations.

 iii.   Another important factor that can be mentioned has to do with effective and efficient
        implementation of FAP from Fondo Ambiental Nacional (FAN), this created what we
        call a virtuous circle out of which many more organizations become interested in joining
        the effort. Management capacities in FAN delivered what stakeholders were expecting
        and this "confidence in the organization" generated more interest and commitment, and
        thus more funding.

That FAP supports about 24% of all the basic operational costs of the National System of
Protected Areas (SNAP)

   i.   The success in reaching the 24% target of funding to basic operational expenses was
        dependent on the capacity of FAN to manage effectively its investment portfolio to
        assure an adequate rate of return from investments (in Ecuador and abroad) to maximize
        the amounts for the protected areas but assuring that the endowment funds were protected
        to prevent any loose of the original donations for the endowment. The average return for


                                                  69

         the GEF Grant of the last three years is 6.89% and the average return of the entire
         portfolio (GEF grant plus debt for nature swaps plus contribution of the Republic of
         Ecuador) is 7.2% after all costs from Asset Managers and Investment Advisors. This
         level of management capabilities from FAN allowed in the period 2003-2008 providing
         $2.3 million to the SNAP through FAP.

  ii.    Another aspect that should be mentioned is that between 2003-2008 not only $2.3 million
         of new funding was made possible for SNAP but all the principle of the endowment
         never went below the original grant amounts but through re-capitalization of funds not
         allocated to Protected areas the total endowment was increased in more than $500,000.

 iii.    Another important factor which was very important to asses the level of funding for
         protected areas through FAP was the financial needs assessment conducted by the
         Ministry of Ecuador with the support of various organizations (Grupo Promotor)
         including FAN, which identified the level of funding for the basic scenario of operations
         of SNAP that by 2004 was of %2.7 million per year. Our current estimate is that yearly
         around $3 million are spent in SNAP and out of those, $670,000 per year come from FAP
         which represents slightly above 22%.

Other relevant outcomes as result of project implementation, not originally identified.

At the start of the Project we did not forth see that FAN, out of the implementation of the project
and its results, was going to more than triple the funds it provides from its portfolio since 2002, as
a reference the projected operational budget for 2008 $US 4 million (programs and projects).

Another outcome that was not forth seen was that during the implementation of FAP other
sources of funding were secured to develop a monitoring and evaluation tool for FAP, with
funding from the MacArthur Foundation, which was developed together with the Ministry of the
Environment. During the implementation of the Project and with support from Conservation
International 쵦cuador we successfully engaged the GB Moore Foundation to provide funding on
basic operations and some investments in Sangay National Park and Podocarpus National Park.
This grant also allowed us to sub grant funds to Fundacin Natura working in the Cordillera del
Condor Region and Fundacion Arco Iris of Loja working in the buffer zones of Podocarpus
National Park in the high biodiversity area of Nangaritza.

Fondo Ambiental Nacional capabilities to manage endowment funds to support other biodiversity
conservation, or sustainable use of natural resources, also generated interest of other donors,
currently we are managing the Invasive Species Fund for Galapagos (GEF-UNDP, United
Nations Foundation-UNF, Conservation International-CGF, UNESCO), the ProCuencas
Podocarpus Fund (Municipality of Zamora, Ministry of the Environment, The Nature
Conservancy, Conservation International, Arco Iris Foundation), The Gran Reserva Chachi Fund
(CI  Ecuador and GTZ), and the Bosque Protector Chongn Colonche Fund (Germanys KfW
and Ministry of the Environment). Without this Project Fondo Ambiental Nacional would not
have developed those skills that are being transferred to other initiatives as the ones described
above. The above provides a very interesting and valuable institutional capacity of an Ecuadorian
organization to manage and channel those types of funding.

The Project allowed for the implementation of FAP in FAN and had provisions for institutional
strengthening with funding for incremental costs, outreach to donors, and participation in
RedLAC the Latin American and Caribbean Network of Environmental Funds (very effective



                                                  70

space for best practice sharing among Funds). The implementation of the project gave FAN
stronger capabilities not only to implement better its strategy but to also adjust the strategy to a
more challenging environment where to support biodiversity conservation basic operations are
not sufficient and other strategies with buffer zones and local communities must be
implemented.

    4. Sustainability of the Project

Since the Project financed the start of the implementation of a long term funding mechanism for
sustainable financing of protected areas in Ecuador, through and endowment fund (Protected
Areas Fund) all provisions have been taken and incorporated in our operations to assure that the
objectives of this Project with regards to financial sustainability are maintained once project is
over. This includes: a strategy to continue capitalizing FAP (target $35 million 2011), a very
carefully designed and closely monitored investment strategy for the operation of the endowment
funds, and a Monitoring and Evaluation Tool to track together with the Ministry of the
Environment the implementation of FAP. Institutional sustainability has also been addressed by
having achieved close working relations with the personnel of the Ministry of the Environment,
whom now truly see themselves as co-owners of FAP.

As for year 2008 out of the Protected Areas Fund (FAP) we will be providing $670,000 for
activities in Protected Areas this is more than 20% of all funding to the National System of
Protected Areas funding originating from an Ecuadorian institution in operation since 2001 with a
long term strategy for funding Protected Areas. This is also a strong element of financial
sustainability for the System.

Other objectives and outcomes of the Project (Components under the responsibility of the
Ministry of the Environment) benefit in terms of sustainability from Fondo Ambiental, such as
the Strategic Plan for the National System of Protected Areas, in its process of development,
Fondo Ambiental participated very actively, and also during the development the Strategy for
Sustainable Financing of the National System of Protected Areas. In both documents FAP and
Fondo Ambiental Nacional are recognized as key elements of the financial sustainability of the
System.



Final Considerations

            i.   There is potential to further upscale FAP to cover all Protected Areas in Ecuador
                 building on the successful implementation of this Project, other parallel projects
                 for FAP with other donors, and the credibility and confidence achieved by FAN
                 and the Ministry of the Environment in implementing FAP.

           ii.   This project has made a very big difference in the financing of the National
                 System of Protected Areas in Ecuador, but we have not completed the job yet, we
                 need to reach the new target of raising $35 million by 2011 so we can go from 11
                 protected areas receiving support to the 36 protected areas of SNAP. The Bank
                 can play a key role this with additional endowment funds from the GEF portfolio
                 that will be matched by other donors.




                                                 71

iii. The Bank could also help Fondo Ambiental and other environmental funds in the
     region which have received support from GEF-WB to further refine our
     assessment of impacts on biodiversity conservation from FAP.

iv.  We like to recognize the work of our colleagues at The Ministry of the
     Environment and at the Protected Areas which are key actors in the successful
     implementation of this Project an FAP, as well as the technical and
     administrative staff of Fondo Ambiental Nacional, and also the leadership and
     guidance from our Board of Directors.

 v.  We specially like to recognize the World Bank and its Staff in Quito and in
     Washington for their guidance and support through all the implementation of the
     project and particularly our Project Manager Ms. Gabriela Arcos, we sincerely
     hope to continue working with the World Bank as implementing agency of GEF.

Ms. Arcos:

This letter has as main objective to express our points of view as co-financiers of Component 3
under the above indicated Project. This component was executed by the National Environmental
Fund and the objective was to establish and operate the Protected Areas Trust Fund (PAF) to
cover the basic recurrent costs of at least nine protected areas and ensure a long-term financing
mechanisms for the National System of Protected Areas. The Government of Germany, through
KFW, provided the initial matching funds to the GEF seed capital, totaling US $ 3. 9 million
through a first debt swap negotiated with the Government of Ecuador.

During the implementation of the project, additional contributions to capitalize the PAF took
place as follows: i) A second debt for nature swap between Ecuador and Germany negotiated
between 2005 and 2006 together with interest capitalization allowed FAP to reach a US $ 12.8
million capital ii) A third debt swap that took place at the end of 2007, has increased the capital to
US$ 13,5 million.

Main Outcomes. The main outcomes under component 3 are the establishment of a sustainable
financial system able to cover the basic needs of some of the most important protected areas of
the national protected areas system, the implementation of a basic monitoring system through the
national environment fund (FAN) of the yearly operational plans of the areas covered.
Component 3 also helped to elaborate the financial gap analysis and to design Ecuador strategy
for financial sustainability of its national protected areas system.

Coordination though the implementation of the project. In the beginning coordination was week.
We would have preferred the World Bank to have a condition included claiming initial
capitalization of the PAF for an amount of US $ 1 million before starting the project. Later on, a
permanent dialogue with World Bank allowed coordinated action when necessary and a common
position of donors in moments when political decisions endangered the existence of the PAF as it
was initially conceptualized.

Main recommendations for the future. Donor coordination under the guidance of FAN and the
national Environment Ministry should be institutionalized.

Sincerely,
