Kingdom of Morocco
Ahoml:            US$100.0 million Equivalent
Terms:   20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
The proposed Project would assist Morocco and CNCA, for 19941997, to consolidate
pomion:           and deepen the institutional reform process (initiated under Loan 3088-MOR), and to
develop the sustainable foundations of a financially sound rural finan%e system well-
itegrated into a gradually liberalized financial sector. Strategically consistent with the
Governmentis adjustment program and priorities supported by the Bank, in particular
through the recent Financial Sector Development Project and two successfilly completed
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loans, the Project would help: (a) achieve a key transition
in CNCA's institutioPal development by supporting CNCA's conversion to a more
diversified bank with increased managerial autonomy, geared to serve agriculture and to
reach small farmers, young entrepreneurs/graduates and non-farm clients (notably women)
in poverty-related areas; (b) promote private investment in viable projects, including agro-
industries with export potential; (c) increase domestic resource mobilization and secure the
rural banking system through a pilot drought relief fund/crop insurance system drawing on
best practices worldwide; and (d) develop banking and technical skills needed to manage
the changed organization and special features of a sustainable rural finance operation.
Specifically the Project would fund over a four-year implementation period: (a) medium-
and long-term credit to private farmers and investors to finane a wide range of
investments including water conservation measures in irrigation, farm equipment, tree crop
and livestock development, storage facilities, land improvement, greenhouses,
agro-processing plants, coastal fisheries, rural housing, forestry -md environmental
protection, and rural ncn-farm investments, and (b) project-related traiing, consulting
services for the strengtheming of CNCA management and planning and to manage the
effects of drought. A mid-term review will assess progress made during implementation.
Since the Government of Morocco reemphasized the role of CNCA in the development of
the country's rural sector and the need to transform CNCA into a universal bank so as to
improve its long-term viability, CNCA has the highest political support for its reforms.
Thus, the risk of a slower pace than expected in the continued execution of the proposed
improvements is considered reduced. Morocco, however, is vulnerable to droughts, and
these have an immediate adverse impact on farm credit recoveries and rural savings
mobilization. On the basis of past and current experience, iBRD funds are not expected
to be at more than normal risk, if the Government is committed to improving its ability to
manage droughts. CNCA overall operating results are positive and should stay that way,
in view of its prudent lending policies, non-drought-related good collection record, the
quality of its management, and the adoption of enhanced prudential banking regulations for
loan classification and loan loss provisions currently introduced in Morocco, as part of the
ongoing financial sector reforms.

SfAFIW APPRAISAL RFPORT
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROIECT
I. INTRODUCllON
1.01         The Kingdom of Morocco and the Caisse Nationale de Crddit Agricole (CNCA) have
requested Bank assistance to finance, with other cofinanciers, a National Rural Finance Project. The Project
would consolidate and expand previous successful Bank-financed agricultural credit projects implemented
by CNCA, in particular the innovative National Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 3088-MOR) which has
progressed well and was timely implemented. Compared to agricultural credit institutions in other countries,
including Asia, CNCA's perfornance has been quite good. CNCA has been able to reach small- and
medium-size farms and is considered to be one of the premiere rural financial institutions in developing
countries. It is a well-managed and efficient bink. However, CNCA is lending in a risk-prone environment
that has limited the participation of other Moroccan banks in rural finance. Periodically droughts strike
Moroccan agriculture causing severe hardship for many vulnerable and relatively poor farmers (as has been
the case in the last two years where particularly severe droughts have occurred in Morocco). As a
consequence, loan areas increase and the financial sitution of CNCA is weakened, requiring injections
of capital or direct and indirect drought relief subsidies from the Government. One important objective of
the proposed project is to help farmers in managing severe climatic risk while assisting CNCA to become
a stronger financial institution. A key element of this strategy is to assist the Govermment in building a
climatic risk management and insurance scheme that would not only permit broader risk sharing but reduce
the burden on the budget of periodic droughts. Another element is to support CNCA in becoming an even
more efficient and universal bank, still specialized in rural finance but with a more diversified portfolio.
ITis involves transforming CNCA into an increasingly autonomous and decentralized bank geared to rural
fmance while strengthening its managerial efficiency and financial condition through improved financial
performance and higher margins, increased mobilization of voluntary domestic savings, and adequate
provisioning against risky investments. In addition, the project would improve agricultural productivity by
fiancing on-farm investments, and would generate job and income opportunities in rural areas by increasing
access by creditworthy farmers, women, and young graduates to irstitutional credit and savings services.
The result would be an increasing share of investment in agriculture by the private sector. Also, by building
better risk management mechanisms for agriculture, open to all banks in Morocco, rural finance would
gradually interest other banks.
1.02         The Project would be implemented by CNCA and finance on-farm investments undertaken
by private farmers and farmers' cooperatives, investments for the establishment or expansion of agro-
industries (including working capital and technical assistance), of private coastal fisheries, of artisans (men
and women), of rural non-farm enterprises, for reforestation and environmental protection, and for rural
housing investments. The Project would also finance, training/technical assistance to strengthen CNCA's
organizational and regional structure, and improvement of the planning and control process, including
CNCA's decetalized Management Information Systems (MIS) and of Morocco's crop insurance system.
The Project would be implemented over a four-year period (1994-1997).
1.03         The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$1,150 million, of which US$439 million
(39%) is foreign exchange. A Bank loan of US$100 million to CNCA would finance part of CNCA's
medium- and long-tm lending, and part of its institutional development cost during the Project period. The
remaning investment resources would be mainly provided by CNCA's own resources, sub-
borrowers' contributions, and by loans from the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of Germany (KfW
loan to Government to be passed on to CNCA as a capital increase), the European Investment Bank (EIB),
the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of the Government of Japan, the Arab Fund for Economic
and Social Development (FADES), and the Caisse Francaise de Developpement (CFD).
1.04         The Project was identified and prepared by CNCA with the assistance of Bank missions
supervising the National Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 3088-MOR). The Project was appraised in April



1993 by a Bank mission (joint appraisal with KfW), in coordination with other cofinanciers and in close
cooperation with the Moroccan authorities.
II. TE AGRICULT-URAL SECTOR
A. Economic Outlook
2.01          Background on the Moroccan economy, past economic performance, recent economic trends
and the Government's adjustment efforts, as well as social indicators are fully described in a report on a
Structural Adjustment Loan to the Kingdom of Morocco (Report No. P-5637-MOR) which was signed on
April 30, 1992. Current economic, financial, and social priorities are highlighted in the Country Assisanc
Stal.gy (CAS) for Morocco, attached to the Memorandum of the President for this project. Agriculture is
a major sector priority for development in Morocco.
2.02          The Bank and the iM!I have supported the economic adjustment process in Morocco to
foster sustainable and equitable growth. Morocco has made substantial progress on macro-economic
stabilization this past decade. The piesent Project would help the Government meet its reform objectives
of private sector investment, progress in development and employment in poor rural areas, export promodon
and domesdc resource mobilization while reducing pressure for public expenditures.
B. }lace of Agricuire in the Economy
^.03          Agriculture plays a crucial role in the nation's economy. It accounts for about 18% of
GDP, provides about 40% of employment, and 30% of export earnings. During 198-89, agriculure
recorded an impressive average annual growth of 6.7%; the average GDP growth during the same period
was 4.1%. Together with phosphates and tourism, agricultural export is the leading source of foreign
excange earings in the economy. However, the contribution of agriculture to the economy varied
considerably between the 1960s and the early 1990s:
% of GDP      % Employment    %

Of Morocco's toal land area of 60 million ha, 8 million ha or 13 % is suitable for agriculture. 'he dominant
crops are cereals and pulses. Of the cultivated land, about 50% receives good but inconsistent rainfall.
About I million ha are irrigated to grow fruits, vegetables, forage and industrial crops.
C. Agdrta     Sector Perform      and Government S pM
2.04         Pad Perf        . Ihe agricultural sector has played a dynamic role in the growth of
Morocco's economy despite periodic droughts as shown in the table of para. 2.03. After a period of slow
growth in the 1970s (2.4% p.a.), the growth rate increased during the 1980s to 6.7% p.a. mainly due to
favorable weather conditions since 1985. Farm productivity is low except in irrigated areas but the sector
has considerable untapped growth potential (Annex 5).
2.05          Govmmen Sate. Growth through private sector investments in rural areas with
consideration to the poverty that exists in certain regions of the country is the balanced approach to

agriculture and rural development being sought by the Government and the Bank. This principal objective
is being pursued within the framework of the Mediun.-Term Agricultural Sector Adjustment Program
(MTASAP). The components of this strategy are detailed in Annex 5.
2.06           Ubstjgi.nal Credit and .yM nvisimet. A key element in the Government's strategy
is to shift emphasis to private investment channelled through institutional credit, and away from public sector
investment. The Project would be an important provider of funds for the implementation of this strategy,
in particular to finance investments in on-farm and market level storage, farm mechanization, field irrigation
facilities and agro-industfy.
11). Secdoral -ues Relevant to Rural FINce
2.07          Sectoral issues that affect the design of rural finance operations are the following: (a)
poverty among rural families, which results in low debt service capacity (a poverty assessment is available
on Morocco - Bank Report No. 11918-MOR of July 1993); (O) the need to mobilize deposits and savings
at. market conditions; (c) financing of agro-industrial development to complement primary agricultural
.produStion (this sub-sector is fully described in Bank Report No. 11727-MOR of June 30, 1993); (d)
!alleviation of land tenmre constraints to investment incentives, productivity and access to credit; and (e) high
climatic risk faced by agricultural production. To reduce this risk, it is proposed to create an agricultural
insurance Fund involving private insurance companies (pira. 5.15). Tlese sectoral f.atures are more fully
discssed in Annex 5, paras. 8
to 14.
E. Bank-Rol in the AnroimWlua Sector
-2.08         The Bank Group has provided considerable support to Morocco. As of June 30, 1993, 105
loans (including S IDA Credits) have been made, supported by US$9,714 million Bank/IDA funds (US$45.2
million of IDA Credits), net of cancellations. Total IFC net commitments in Morocco amount to US$184.2
million. In agriculture, the Bank plays an important role. To date, 21 projects and two adjustment loans
(ASAL I and U) have been completed and five projects and one sector investment loan (ASIL) are at various
stages of implementation, with a total sum of US$1,765 million Bank Group lending (see details by project
in Annex 5, para. 15). As part of the Bank's recent portfolio managemet initiative, a Country Portfolio
Performance Review (CPPR) took place in Morocco in FY93. There is currendy no candidate projects for
restucturing or loan cancellation in the agriculture portfolio.
2.09         Lmo   Leaned from  Past   gic ral Credit Pre           .  Performance of the
Agricultura Credit Projects has been good. OED reports stress the contribution made by the projects to
agricultral development, their success in mobilizing capital for private sector investment in Morocco, and
in introducing institution building measures (CNCA) and the successful expansion of credit to small farmers.
One important lesson learned from past projects is that a financially viable farm credit system can be
maintned with a positive interest rate strucure (para. 4.20). Experience has also shown that CNCA needs
to be strengthened to provide more competitive banking services to its diversified clientele (para. 6.09(e)),
and to improve domestic resource mobilization (para. 4.29). Increased private sector lending by CNCA in
Morocco provides a major source of growth for Moroccan agriculture. A more detailed description of the
projects' performance and development impact is given in Annex 10.

3.01          isttutiona &Ift. Morocco has a well-developed financial sector. It consists of the
Cental Bank-Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM)-, 15 commercial banks, five specialized credit institutions, among
them: the Agriculttiral Credit Bank (CNCA); the Housing and Tourism Bank (CIH); and the Industrial
Dovelopment Bank (BNDE). Tbere is also a capital market (Casablanca stock exchange) where stocks and
bonds of private companies are listed and traded. It has, until now, played a limited role in mobilizing
equity finance. At the end of 1992, the total banking system provided about DH 104.0 billion to the
economy, about 63% of which (DH 65.0 billion) were short-term. There are also two savings banks, six
leasing companies, mostly owned by the banks, and several insurance companies. Agricultural insurance
is in its infancy in Morocco and needs to be further developed. The Treasury of the Ministry of Finance
(MF) plays an important role in defining financial sector policies (para. 3.02). The Government is al.so
promoting, under a new law and with Bank's assistance, the role of the Communal Infrastructure Fund
(FEC). FEC will be both a financial institution subject to the supervision of BAM and a public sector
enterprise controiled by the MF. FEC's basic mission, is to finance local investments to enhance the quality
of communal infrastructes ncluding in rural areas. Details are in Annex 6.
Jina      Sector Policies and Reforms
3.02          In the mid 1980s, the Government started to implement a program of progressive elimination
of direct monetary controls, to increase the efficiency and responsiveness of financiW intermediation. In
1990, improved macroeconomic stability and the projected decline in the need for domestic fiancing of the
budget deficit encouraged authorities to move to a second phase of reforms. These reforms are supported
by the Financial Sector Development joect (FSDP) for which a Bank loan of US$235 million was approved
in 1991. Reforms include: (a) the transition towards indirect instruments of monetary management; (b)
the development of domestic financial markets, in particular for government securities; (c) the liberalization
of most interest rates and the elimination of directed credit policies; and (d) the strengthening of bank
supvision and prudential regulations. Details are in Annex 9.
IV. THE CALSSE NATIONALE bE CREDIT AGRICOLE
A. Oa on and Stffn
4.01          CNCA was established by the State in 1961 as the institution responsible for financing the
development of the agricultural sector. It fulfilled that function very effectively and, in 25 years, became
one of the largest and most important financial institutions in Morocco. In 1987, the Government decided
that, while continuing to play a leading role in agriculture, CNCA should broaden its activities into rural and
commercial banking to become a multipurpose bank (a universal bank). Its mission is still enhanced by the
higher priority being given to rural development and to the activities expected of CNCA in the future:
expansion of credit, especially to small farmers; prudent diversification of operations, especially into agro-
industries, fisheries, artisanal industries and other rural activities (notably women clients); increased
mobilization of voluntary deposits and savings in particular rural savings; continued
regionalizationldecentralization of credit and banking activities; and enhanced financial autonomy.
Q _on
4.02          To fulfll effectivel the above functions, CNCA embarked, at the end of 1991, into the
implementation phase of a major r., &cization of its structure. For that purpose, five wdeldgations",
equivalent to vice-presidencies, are being created at the Headquarters office: Loau and Portfolio



Management; Branch Network Development and Promotion; Hunan Resources and Logistics; Finance and
Accounting; and Planning, Management Control and Internal Audit. The Inspection Directorates (para. 4.09)
will also be strengthened.
4.03         The Loan and Portfolio Management is responsible for providing support to the 'Caisses
Regionales" (Regional Branch Offices) in the appraisal of lending operations, ensuring the technical quality
of operaions, and processing the loans that are beyond the approval limits of regional branches. The Branch
Network Development and Promotion is mainly responsible for providing pro-active marketing support to
CNCA's branch offies and for assisting in the expansion of the branch network.
4.04          The new structure will include an International Opemions Departnent ([OD) and a Data
Processing Department (DPD). The main responsibilities of the OI) will be to help CNCA develop its
commercial activities in import-export prefinancing. This is a relatively new field of operations for CNCA
which will require a great deal of staff training. To ensure e  success of this activity, CNCA has recruited
a commercial banker with experience in international trade financing. The other department, DPD, is in
charge of developing CNCA's data processing capabilities which need to be rapidly upgraded. The new
organization structure took effect in May 1993.
4.05          In addition to these organization changes at CNCA's Headquarters. a significant innovation
is being introduced in CNCA's field organization. It consists of the creation of eight Regional Delegations,
that is one,for each new economic region of the country with the region of Casablanca having two
delegations becamse of its size and economic weight. The main functions of the regional delegation are to
coordinate, support and monitor the operations of the various regional and local branches established within
the region.
4.06         The long-maturing sew organization has merits because it consolidates various activities
under the authority of a limited number of managers and provides CNCA with a structure needed for the
expansion and the diversification of its operations. In the long run, the regional delegations are expected
to evolve towards increased line authority and responsibility in their respective region.
4.07          CNCA is administered by a board of directors and a Director General who is the chief
executive officer (CEO). The board includes representatives from the ministries of Agriculture, Finance,
Planning, and Interior, of the Bank AI-Magbrib and of local farmers/institutions. Its role is being reoriented
toward the normal and appropriate board functions of strategy and policy making, budget approval, overall
supervision and evaluation of performance, and approval of audited accounts. The Director General is
appointed by Royal Decree and is in charge of the overall management of the bank and of overseeing its
performance.
4.08          To implement CNCA's change In strategic direction, the King of Morocco appointed a new
Director General in January 1987. The Director General appoints CNCA's staff with the exception of the
financial controller who is appointed by the Ministry of Finance. The Controller is required to report to
Govenment on CNCA's compliance with pertinent laws. An independent private auditor is hired by CNCA
to perform an amnal audit of the bank's financial s emets before they are approved by the Board at the
annual meeting. CNCA's top management is experienced and capable. The Project will support CNCA's
institional strengthening by providing funds for training, data processing and consultant services (paras.
5.12 to 5.14).
4.09          CNCA's credit is extended from its Headquarlers office in Rabat, 51 Regional Branches
(CRCAs)' and 126 Local Branches (CLCAs)1, about 50% of which offer banking services. In addition,

155 seasonal credit outlets attached to CLCAs are operational as well as 16 deposit branches in major urban
centers. There are siX Inspection Directorates (IRCAs)' in charge of banking inipection, coordination of
credit activities, and undertaking special surveys and studies. Due to the rapid ewvansion of the lending
program and other banking services, CNCA needs additional and more modem office space.
atmn ad NW iIflin
4.10          At the end of 1992, CNCA staff numbered 3,385, 27%  of whom were located at
headquarters and 73% in the field. The distribution of staff between Headquarters and field offices (CRCAs
and CLCAs) at the end of 1987, i.e five years earlier when staff totaled 2,474, was 33% at Headquarters
and 67% in the field. This evolution is favorable.
4.11          Staff productivity is fairly high. Between 1987 and 1992, CNCA's total staff increased at
an average annual rate of about 6% while the volume of lending increased at an annual rate of about 11%.
The volume of annual lending per staff is about DH 1.6 million for Headquarters and the CRCAs (about 230
loans processed per staff per year) and about DH 1.2 million for the CLCAs (500 loans processed per staff
per year). CNCA's staff is relatively well educated. Most support staff are high school graduates or have
a professional training diploma. Middle and higher management staff (22% of total) are university
graduates. Every newly appointed employee receives induction training of from one to six months depending
on his or her position.
4.12          CNCA has made considerable effort under Loan 3088-MOR to upgrade the training
provided in its in-house center. Results have been quite encouraging in terms of the number of staff
attending training programs and also in terms of the variety of programs being offered. While in 1988 35%
of the staff received training, the proportion increased to 41 % in 1989 and to 48% in 1990. Furthermore,
the center developed programs that are in line with CNCA's objective of becoming a multi-purpose bank.
These include seminars on commercial banking operations, marketing, data processing, human resources
management, resource mobilization, import-export, pre-financing, appraisal of agro-industry lending
including enviromental impact. Emphasis was also placed on improving the quality of the training itself.
B.  MI        PoLcies and P 1oedures
4.13          CNCA's lending policies are spelled out in its statement of policies approved by the Board
of directors in 1989 (Annex 11). The forms of services are very diverse: short-, medium- and long-term
loans; all banking operations; leasing schemes; underwriting of equity investments; assistance to enterprises
to mobilize resources; management of public finds or loans for the account of the State. The policy
statement also indicates that CNCA will finance only projects that meet specific criteria of technical,
environmental, economic and financial viability; and that it will not finance more than 80% of the total cost
of an investment program, including leasing schemes. These policies are sound and satisfactorily
implemented.
4.14          Simplification of procedures and expansion of the range of investment financed have been
the main feaures of CNCA's credit policies. Lending operations are governed by 'Credit Guidelines"'
which are revised periodically. A major oveaul of these guidelines was done in 1990-91 to incorporate
CNCA diversified operations and recent elements of financial sector liberalization. They are comprehensive
and cover types of credit available for each activity, appraisal criteria, financing norms, sub-borrower
contributions, inerest rates, maturities, loan approval authorities, security for loans and maximum credit
ceilings available to borrowers. Lending procedures are different for commercial farmers, clients of
Headquarters or CRCAs, and for small farmers who are clients of CLCAs. Loans from Headquarters and

i/      Normes et conditios p6cifiques de fiancament.



CRCAs are subject to considerably more stringent appraisal criteria than loans from CLCAs, for which
procedures are streamlined. Short-term loans are usually granted for periods of 3 months (harvest loan) to
12 months and finance farm inputs and produce marketing; medium- and long-term loans extend from 2 to
20 years (up to 25 years for rural housing) and finance a wide range of on-farm and other investments.
CNCA is servicing about one million clients nationwide.
Headquarters OMce and CRCAs
4.15          The Headquarters office lends to about 18,000 clients, essentially large farmers whose
borrowings exceed the CRCAs' loan approval authority, irrigation development agencies (ORMVAs), and
private agro-industrial enterprises. CRCAs lend to about 300,000 clients. This includes individual farmers
with a fiscal income (Fl)s above DH 6,000 (actual net farm income of at least IH 12,000 or US$1,500),
Agrarian Reform Cooperatives, agricultural and agro-industrial enterprises and exporters. Loan approval
authority is below DH 650,000 (US$72,000).
4.16          CNCA has achieved an acceptable balance between thoroughness of appraisal and the
objective of reaching a large number of farmers with limited staff resources and operating costs. Field
appraisal is systematically undertaken for investments in land improvement, irrigation, purebred livestock,
plantations, poultry farming, rural housing, coastal fishing and for all loans disbursed by installments.
On-farm appraisal is also carried out for other purposes when considered necessary. Loans made for the
purchase of equipment can represent up to 70% of investment costs.
4.17          Loan applications are reviewed and approved by the CRCAs' credit committee which meets
weeldy. It is chaired by the CRCA director. The type of guarantee required from borrowers is based on
CRCA staff judgment of credit risk. Short-term loans to individuals are generally secured by crop liens and
sureties and medium- and long-term loans by a chattel mortgage on equipment. Loans for land
improvement, irrigation and construction are secured by a mortgage.
4.18          CLCAs process 65% of all CNCA loans (but about 18% only of total loan amounts) and
make loans to about 600,000 clients, essentially small farmers, artisans and rural women with a fiscal income
of less than DH 6,000, which corresponds roughly to an annual net farm income of less than DH 12,000
(US$1,500). Comprehensive lists of farmers' Fl are kept with CLCAs and consulted for every loan
application. As in the case of CRCA clients, loan amounts are determined on the basis of norms revised
annually. However, there is a ceiling on maximum borrowings intended to keep borrowing within the
estimated debt capacity of CLCA clients. For farmers having documented title to their land, maximum
short-term borrowing is limited to DH 40,000 (US$5,000) and maximum medium-term loans outstanding
to DH 80,000 (US$10,000). For borrowers without any evidence of ownership, short-term loans are limited
to 200% of thei FI and medium-term loans to 800% of FI. The current trend is towards decentralization,
making local branches more autonomous in their lending decisions.
4.19          The ceiling on borrowing capacity reduces CLCA lending risk. This is important, because
loan appraisal is based on desk review. Systematic field appraisal and supervision of loans made to small
farmers (average loan in 1991 was about DH 5,100 or US$640) would not be administratively or financially
feasible. The FI ceiling is necessarily arbitrary, but it minimizes risk.
Interest Rates
4.20          Current nominal interest rates (1993) on CNCA's loans are presented below (inflation was
5% in 1992 and in the 4-5% range in 1993):
I/      Net income estimated for tax purposes. Depending upon the crops grown, real annual not farm incomes range
from 2 to more than 20 times fiscal incomes.

/d Effective interest rates are higher than nominal rates because of additional fees.
4.21          Interest rates on CNCA's loans are compatible with those charged by commercial banks for
comparable loans. Real interest rates are high in Morocco. In addition, an appraisal fee of 0.05% is
charged on CRCA and Headquarters loans6 and a 0.75% commitment fee is charged on the part of the loan
that has not been disbursed six months after the signature of the loan agreement, regardless of the amount
of other loans. Medium- and long-term loans are also charged a 1% front-end guarantee commission to
partially cover the foreign exchange risk with the exception of loans for rural housing. A life insurame
premium for housing and medium- and long-term credit was introduced in July 1993.
4.22          The domestic rate of inflation, which rose from 3.1% in 1989 to 6.7% in 1990 and 8.2%
in 1991, declined to about 5% in 1992 and less than 5% in 1993. As inflation is expected to remain in this
order of magnitude in coming years, CNCA lending rates would remain positive in real terms during the
project period. Increase in the cost of CNCA's resources would also impact CNCA's financial viability.
A mechanism has been established under the Project to enable CNCA to freely adjust its interest rates on
its loans so as to protect its financial margins and profitability (para. 6.09 (b)).
C. Lendng Operations
4.23          In 1992, total CNCA lending reached DH 3,343 million (Annex 1, Table 1) down from
DH 4,918.9 million the previous year, only because of the drought. From 1988 to 1991, CNCA achieved
6/     On loans of more than DH 5,000.



-9 -
an annual average rate of growth of 15%. Including the year of drought in 1992, the average annual rate
of growth was only 3%. In real terms, lending increased at about 10% per normal year.
4.24          Over the 1988-92 period, the share of short-term credit in total credit varied from 55% to
about 60%. In 1992 ( a non-drought year), short-term loans to private farmers primarily financed crop
production (56%), animal production (14%) and animal feed (5%). Short-term credit to State agricultural
companies, which represented 10% of total short-term lending, was used mainly to finance, through the
ORMVAs, industrial crop production (cotton, sugar beet and sugar cane) in irrigated perimeters. New
private sectors of short-term lending activities opened in 1989 now represent 10% of short-term lending.
They include handicraft, fisheries and agro-industries. In 1991, about 25% of total medium- and long-term
credit went to CLCA clients (mostly for livestock, including construction7 as for previous years), 55% went
to individual CRCA clients and the balance to Agrarian Reform Cooperatives (2%), State companies (2%),
private agro-industries (8.4%), and rural housing (10%). The last two activities and fisheries expanded since
1989. Four types of investment (all private) represented about 74% of total lending: livestock (25%), farm
and irrigation equipment (25%), rural housing (10%), and agro-industries including green-houses (14%).
Fann Credit Coverafe
4.25          The extent of CNCA's farm credit penetration in rural areas is illustrated in Annex 2, part
B, showing tle number of potential and actual CNCA individual farm clients.
4.26          About 70% of potential CRCA clients, but only 35% of potential CLCA clients were
receiving credit in 1991. Very few marginal farmers with an Fl below DH 1,600 (about 5 ha rainfed land)
were actual CLCA clients, reflecting their low borrowing capacity and their lack of participation in the
monetized economy. The increase in the number of clients has followed the expansion of the network of
CRCA and CLCA offices, but certain upper limit may have been reached. A sharp increase in 1981/82
coincided with the opening of 90 seasonal credit outlets to bring credit facilities closer to farmers, while
containing distribution costs. Given the already current high coverage level of CRCA clients (70%), only
modest scope, in particular in the aftermath of a two-year drought, exists to increase coverage of farm clients
in rainfed areas. The diversification of CNCA's banking activities is essential.
4.27          CNCA's recovery procedures are efficient, and repayment performance is good when the
crop season is normal. Arrears accumulate, however, during drought years. At the end of 1992, total
arrears (essentially drought-related and including previous rescheduled loans coming due) amounted to DH
3.8 billion, i.e 30% of total outstanding loan portfolio. However, CNCA recovers more than 95% of all
its credits, but it takes six to seven years after maturity to reach this target as shown in Annex 7, table 12A,
which also summarizes key indicators on CNCA loan recovery for 1985 to 1992. In August 1992, as result
of the drought, CNCA took a series of actions to improve recovery performance due to default (not
delinquency) in particular at CLCAs servicing small-farmers in rainfed areas, and in March 1993, additional
measures were ordered to cushion the impact of a second consecutive drought (details are in Annex 7, Table
12B). Loan loss provisions are currently covering 100% of arrears of more than 18 months, and are planned
to cover 100% of arrears of more than 12 months in 1996.

amounted to DH 17,342.2 million (US$1,927 million). This represented a yearly compounded increase of
about 12% over the 1988-92 period (total 1988 assets: DH 11,093.3 million). Table 4.2 below shows the

During the 1988-1992 period, the average annual rate of increase of the total balance sheet stabilized at about
12% in current terms, but this indicates that CNCA is still growing. At the end of 1992, long-term
borrowings (DH 9,303.1 million) net of current maturities falling due in 1993 (DH 594.4 million), i.e, DH
8,708.7 million represented 50.2% of CNCA's total resources. About 98% of long-term borrowings were
external borrowings, of which DH 3,867.9 million (42%) were from the World Bank, followed by KfW.
Domestic long-term borrowings declined from DH 224 million in 1988 to DH 91 million in 1992. The
relative decline in CNCA's capital adequacy as measured by the ratio of total equity to risk assets8 (about
13% in 1988 compared to 10% in 1992) is partly due to the new taxation at 40% of net income (down to
38% in 1993), and it indicates that the institution is not able to generate internal equity fast enough to
compensate for the increase in lending volume and business development. While capital adequacy during
the Project period (para. 7.04) is expected to remain above the 8% of risk assets that is generally being
adopted as the international standard for commercial bank capitalization (10% is better for development
banks), the trend line would be monitored annually during project implementation (para. 6.09(b)). KfW
proposed that its contribution to the project be passed on by Government to CNCA as a capital increase.
Over the disbursement period, this would increase CNCA's equity by about 25%.

4.29          D         Recently, CNCA has been relatively successful at mobilizing short-term domestic
resources, and the relative share of voluntary deposits in CNCA's total resources increased significantly from
12% in 1988 to 17% in 1991. In 1991, deposits increased by 25% over the previous year. In four years,
the average annual rate of increase has been nearly 30%. The total amount of deposits increased from DH
1,317 million in 1988 to DH 2,853 million in 1992 (+ 117%). Core deposits are primarily sight deposits
on current accounts (66%), and are mostly mobilized from the CRCAs and zie new "Guichets bancaires"
(banking outlets), installed in the main urban areas specially to attract deposits. Deposit collection at CLCA
level starts to increase even faster (except in 1992), but still represents a small percentage of the total
(2.2%). Since 1987, CNCA has been serving new markets including women farmers and artisans and since
June 1988, it has also been serving Moroccans working abroad. There is still a large scope for developing
savings deposits at CNCA, which now represent less than 5% of total deposits in the whole banking system
as compared with a market share of 2.2% in 1988.
4.30          One-Year Solidait    - Bends. To cushion two past major droughts, and to allow CNCA
to meet vastly increased credit demand, commercial banks have accepted, beginning in 1981, to place 3.5%
(down to 2% since December 1991) of their deposits in agriculture through CNCA at an interest rate of 3%
p.a, then at 4.25% since 1987. These one-year solidarity bonds have decreased from DH 1.4 bilion in 1989
to DH 1.2 billion in 1992 and now represent only 79 of total CNCA's resources (11% in 1989).
Commercial banks are unlikely to make quick progress in financing small farms because of the high risk and
cost involved, and expertise needed. In the poorest rural areas, there is not yet enough business to support
two institutions. This is partly why, in an imperfect financial market, CNCA has to be made stronger to meet
the double challenge of:
(a)   competition from commercial banks located in urban centers along the coast for attractive
banking activities; and
(b)   specialization, to fulfill its basic development mission of financing the rural sector including
in the poorest areas.
Farm incomes dropped sharply in 1992 and 1993 as a result of two consecutive droughts. The Government
and CNCA, however, decided not to recourse to additional one-year bonds from other banks to cushion the
impact of the drought on CLCA operations (para. 4.33), but to use transitional budget resources instead.
With a view to establishing an improved level playing field in the years to come, a sustainable crop insurance
scheme (open to all banks) to cushion the effects of future droughts will be established under the project
(paras. 5.15, 6.12, 7.06, and Annex 13) in anticipation of the eventual elimination of solidarity bonds as part
of the liberalization of the Financial Sector in Morocco.
Lem Portfolio Oualt
4.31          Collection performance and appropriate provisions are good indicators of loan portfolio
quality. Overall, CNCA's track record compared to other, rural finance institutions in developing countries
is strong. Collection performance on drought-related arrears, however, has deteriorated these past years
(Annex 7, Table 12B) and this has led to a certain degree of uncertainty as to the real value of part of
CNCA's loan portfolio and thus the adequacy of its loan loss provisions and real capital. In July 1988,
CNCA made the prudent decisions to convert its current provisions of DH 409.1 million into a special
reserve for unpaid loans, and to introduce an improved approach to calculating new provisions as of 1988,
including a climatic risk provision. The improved approach includes a systematic loan evaluation and
classification system for all loans above a certain amount9 to single borrowers or related entities. Each
borrower is reviewed, at least annually, on the occurrence of any change in the credit lines approved or
significant change in the borrower's condition. A standard classification is applied based on the extent of
past dues, if any, the financial condition of the borrower, the quality of the documentation, the value of the
security held, and the specific loan loss potential identified for the total outstanding to each financially

troubled borrower or related group of borrowers. CNCA has defined appropriate loan classification levels,
criteria and related risk level guidelines, and set up a monitoring process. According to these new guidelines
and procedures, CNCA increased the overall level of credit risk provisions from DH 612 million in 1988
to DH 1,280 million in 1991, a level that the external auditor confirmed to be adequate in normal years i.e
when the crop season is good. Provisions further increased to DH 1,530 million in 1992. Provisions for bad
debts now amount to more than 40% of arrears. Assuming an average real recovery rate of 95%, CNCA
should continue to provision at least 5% of its yearly disbwrsements. This will allow CNCA to maintain in
its accounts an adequate level of provision for bad debts that covers 100% of the real risk of default as
determined by analyzing overdues annually. These steps are essential to establishing CNCA's market
reputation for financial responsibility. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that CNCA would apply
policies and procedures satisfactory to the Bank for loan classification and loan loss provisioning, in
accordance with the prudential regulations and advice of the Central Bank (BAM). Through the gradual
implementation of the climatic risk insurance scheme, provisioning would also be more reflective of normal
credit risk.
Overall Onprn Results. Profitability and Subsdy Dependenc
4.32         CNCA's operating results are positive. CNCA's financial status for 1988-92 is presented
in the summary balance sheets, income statements, and flow of funds statements in Annex 7, Tables I to
4. CNCA's net profit in 1992 was DH 11.6 million, compared with DH 23.2 million in 1988, DH 38.6
milion in 1989, DH 39.1 million in 1990 and DH 40.2 million in 1991. CNCA's financial performance
during this period can be summarized as follows:

/, Since its creation In 1961, CNCA was empt from income tax (till end 1987).
Ic As a Government development bank, CNCA does not pay dividends.
CNCA's average cost of funds in 1992 was roughly 5.5%, compared with 5.0% in 1988. The profit and loss
data in Table 4.3 above shows that the gross interest margin (operating income) over the 1988-92 period has
declined from 55% of interest income in 1988 to 46% in 1992. During the 1988-91 period, CNCA earned
a net return on equity of 3.4% (5.8% before tax) in 1991 but it declined significandy in 1992 where the net
return on equity was only 1.0% (1.8% before tax) as the result of declining margins (due in part to the
impact of the drought on recovery performance) and increased provisioning. Clearly, the profitability of
CNCA is bighly sensitiveto policy and procedures applied to provisioning for loan losses. Once its statuts
have bej lified (placing formally CNCA under the Central Bank regulations and supervision), CNCA
will be      under the guidance of the Central Bank, to the same banking law and prudential regulations
that will >. - ,licable to other bankm as of 1995. CNCA's projected provisions for loan losses for 1993-
1996 are consistent with the prudential regulations stipulated under the new banking law (Annex 7 Table 11).
On economic subsidies, CNCA and the Government of Morocco have reduced between 1988-91 farmers'
and CNCA's implicit and explicit subsidies as measured by a Subsidy Dependency Index. However, for



- 14-
1992, this index increased as a consequence of drought-related impacts on the growth of profits
(Annex 16)10.
4.33          CLCA Operatons.  When they are not adversely affected by droughts, the CLCA
operations can generate sufficient income to cover costs and to generate a small profit (e.g. about DH 0.9
million per year between 1988 an 1991), despite the higher administrative cost involved in lending to small
farmers. This cost represents 3.4% of risk assets for CLCA operations, as compared to 2.9 % for CRCA's
and headquarter's operations. The CLCAs currently represent a highly efficient, relatively low-cost rural
finance window whose development impact is also positive in poor rural areas. In 1992, however, CLCA
operations decreased sharply as the result of the drought and higher risk of default. It will be difficult to
make improvements without increasing costs further until the climatic risk Insurance Fund is in place. The
managers and staff of CLCAs are highly productive in credit operations. They need to maintain their overall
financial viability and improve their performance in deposit mobilization, portfolio diversification, and farm
credit recoveries in particular in the three regions (Sud, Tensift, Oriental) chronically affected by droughts.
E. CNCA's Development Objectives and Straterv
4.34          The year 1987 marked a turning point for CNCA when the Government of Morocco, at the
highest level, reemphasized the role of CNCA in the development of the country's rural sector. New
orientations for CNCA include:
(a)   its transformation into a universal, full-service bank with a qualified and responsible Board
of Directors, while maintaining its farm credit specificity;
(b)    expansion of CNCA's credit operations, to serve a larger number of farmers, particularly
small farmers, the diversification of lending and banking activities to other subsectors,
including fisheries, agro-industries, forestry, land consolidation, rural housing, artisanal and
other rural activities; and
(c)    assurance of CNCA's managerial autonomy and financial viability.
In line with these orientations, CNCA's management has defined the following medium-term development
objectives which are consistent with its charter (para. 4.01) and its sound policy statement (Annex 11):
(a)    assure the sustainability of CNCA and its financial viability by implementing adequate
policies of work organization, staffing, business development, and relations with
Government, borrowers, depositors, and financiers;
(b)   improve its future resource position to meet the currently planned levels of agricultural,
commercial and other diversified lending, by mobilizing demand, time and savings deposits,
as well as new external funds during the Project period;
(c)    develop long-term plans to strengthen and diversify its business base and its asset and
liability structure, and ensure that CNCA continues to have an effective role as the lead
bank in the financing of the agricultural sector;
(d)    pursue the decentralization of its credit and other banking operations by setting annual
objectives at decentralized levels of operations for the use of funds, deposits and savings,
and loan recovery, by restructuring its branch network in the major regions of the country
(regionalization of CNCA), and by opening new full service branches in nrual areas; and
10/    Considerable pmdence should be maintained ;n the interpretation of this subsidy dependency index. See Annex
16 for the assumptions on its calculations.



- 15 -
(e)   improve its operational efficiency by simplifying management tasks and procedures for
some of its banking products, developing new banking services, improving the processing
and supervision of loans and operations, and modernizing its management information,
accounting and control systems (MIS).
To help CNCA achieve these objectives the Project will support the institution to:
(a)   implement a long-term strategic and operational planning system (para. 6.09(c) and Annex
12);
(b)   implement its new internal organization and its executive decision-making information
system developed under Loan 3088-MOR, and further develop the computerization plan of
its banking activities and basic Management Information System (MIS), to allow for more
efficient planning, budgeting, accounting, risk asset and liability management, branch
network coordination, control function management, and personnel management; and
(c)   continue to implement its pluri-annual training program for CNCA's managers and staff
(para. 6.10).
The Project includes financing for technical assistance in the strengthening of CNCA's management,
software, computer maintenance, staff training and small equipment (para. 5.12).
F. CNCA's ProJected Lending Progg
and F-lmdw Reafrements (1993-1996
4.35         Based on past trends, the Government's priorities and objectives, the private sector demand
for credit to finance agricultural investments, and on CNCA's own business development plan and
diversification strategy, CNCA's total lending (Annex 1), after growing at 15% p.a. from 1988 to 1991 (but
decreasing in 1992) is projected to increase again during the coming years, but at a smaller growth rate of
7% to 8% (assuming that 1993 lending reaches the level of 1991). This projection takes into account the
risks involved by lending too much at a time when loan rescheduling is still necessary to spread the impact
of the 1991-92 and 1992-93 droughts and possible future droughts. Under these reasonable conditions, total
lending would reach as much as DH 5,800 million (US$650 million) in 1995 with a ratio of short-term to
medium-term credit of about 1.4:1. Pending revision of the business plan at the end of 1994, projections
for 1996 and 1997 are based on the same assumption for growth. The resources necessary to finance such
a lending program will primarily come from domestic sources through: (a) the repayment of outstanding
subloans; (b) increased deposit mobilization; and (c) financial revenues. The remaining financing needs will
be financed from external sources. The Project's cofinanciers would provide the external financing necessary.
The expected increase in deposits (mostly sight deposits) would provide CNCA with the resources necessary
to finance close to 90% of its short-term lending program as of 1996 (67% in 1992). The Project would
provide CNCA with long-term resources to finance its medium- and long-term lending program.

V. THE PROJECT
A. Rationale for Bank Involvement and Project Objectives
5.01          Rationale for Bank Involvement. Bank involvement would consolidate and deepen the
institutional reform process (initiated under Loan 3088-MOR) to develop a financially sound rural finmze
system well-integrated into a gradually liberalized financial sector strategically linked to the FSDP. In
Morocco, CNCA is a key institution, and its dual role as a bank and as a specialized financial institution in
rural credit/savings is essential. Through CNCA, the Project would fulfill fundamental social and economic
needs in the country for progress in rural development, banking efficiency in financial intermediation,
including the need to separate normal credit risk from climatic risk, and private sector growth. In this
context, the project would be integral to the strategy articulated in the Morocco Country Assistance Strategy
by supporting Government efforts to alleviate rural poverty and to further develop the rural private sector.
The Bank support would also assist CNCA's efforts to raise about US$279 million of additional cofinancing
for investments in the sector and to implement, with Government's support, longer term technical assistance
on drought management.
5.02          Project Objectives. Consistent with the Government's adjustment program and priorities,
the objectives of the project are to assist Morocco in promoting private investment in rural areas and in
developing the sustainable foundations of a financially sound rural finance system well integrated into a
gradually liberalized financial system. The project would aim at:
(a)   financing demand-driven, private sector investments in rural areas and in agro-industries
through CNCA;
(-b)   consolidating the institutional transformation of CNCA into a competitive, universal bank,
in a prudent manner, through clientele and resource diversification;
(c)   increasing domestic resource mobilization and securing the banking system through a
sustainable drought relief fund/crop insurance system;
(d)   providing a full range of competitive banking services and products to rural farm and non-
farm clients (notably women), enterprises and young entrepreneurs/graduates; and
(e)    developing viable credit/savings schemes to reach the rural poor and make them both
productive and creditworthy.
B. S_usM Project Description
5.03          To achieve the above objectives, the Project would support over a four-year implementation
period (1994-1997) the following activities:
(a)    CNCA Credit Program. First, the Project would continue financing CNCA's core
activities and also support its diversification program: (i) on-farm and forestry investments
by private farmers, enterprises and cooperatives, including water conservation measures;
(ii) agro-indus,ry investments including working capital requirements and technical
assistance wi#i UNIDO support; (iii) investments in rural housing constructien; (iv) private
coastal fisheries; (v) private artisans (notably women) and rural non-farm enterprises; and
(v) land consolidation. Second, as new elements of the proposed credit program, the
Project would support CNCA financing of: (i) an expanding program of women's activities
in rural areas; and (ii) young entrepreneurs/graduates.



- 17 -
(b)   Stergh        of CNCA and Institutional Development. Consistent with CNCA's policy
statement and change in strategic direction, the Project would support and fund: (i) the
training program, MIS software and office technology equipment and maintenance needed
to better manage CNCA as a universal bank, assist CNCA's clientele, and promote
export-related operations and lending to women; (ii) training specialists; (iii) professional
visits overseas for local trainers and managers; and (iv) consulting services required for the
strengthening of CNCA management and to support Project implementation, including
technical assistance for agricultural insurance development and drought management.

C-NCA Credit PQ
5.04          Investment Lending to Small Farmers. This component would finance about 267,000
subloans for on-farm investment by small private farmer clients of CLCAs. Beneficiaries include both men
and women. Investment would mainly be for livestock, draft animals, stables, wells and pumps, land
improvement, small mechanization and on-farm storage. This component (US$278 million) would represent
about 27% of total investment under the Project.
5.05          Investmnt Lending to Medium and lAMe Fames. This component would finance
about 48,000 subloans to larger commercial clients of CRCAs or CNCA Headquarters (including
cooperatives) for on-farm investments in response to market demand. Lending would be mainly for
agricultural machinery such as tractors and harvesters, transport, wells and irrigation, greenhouse
construction and equipment, plantations, livestock and land improvement. In addition, CNCA would finance
maintance operations undertaken by smallholders in large irrigation perimeters under the supervision of
ORMVAs, including water conservation measures. This component (US$452 million) would represent about
43% of total investment under the Project.
5.06          Lending to Agindusties. This component would mainly finance investment in working
capital and technical assistance needs of private small- and medium-size enterprises. The bulk of the market
demand is for investments in fruit and vegetable packing and processing, olive oil processing and dairy
production, flour milling, meat and fish processing, poultry, animal feed and storage. It also includes wood
processing and other activities. This component (US$105 million for about 310 investment projects) would
represent about 10% of total investment. Bank loan proceeds allocated to agro-industry represents only
US$15 million.
5.07          Lfndiuf for the OCtr uction of Rural Housing. The main objective of this component
is to provide well-targeted credit for construction of individual and collective .ural housing for farm families,
agricultural laborers, rural women, and other rural families in order to reduce migration io urban areas.
This component (US$90 million) will finance about 12,500 loans, mainly for low- and medium-income
families and would represent about 9% of total investment under this project.
5.08          Lending to Private Coastal  _in. Lending under this component, which is a recent
activity for CNCA (since 1989), will be highly selective. Priorities are for the supply of fishing gear and
equipment, major repair and the renewal of engines and boats to private fishermen, in particular coastal
fishermen, who have a demonstrated record of fishing performance and creditworthiness in Morocco. This
component (US$41 million for about 660 operations) would represent about 4% of total investment under
the Project.
5.09         Lendinf to Artisanal and Women Activities in Rural Areas. CNCA has developed
experintal saving and lending products for artisanal and non-farm rural clients. These products are
particularly successful with women clients in the Khemisset and Rommani areas. The Project would further
develop these promising activities and finance women borrowers, cooperatives and pre-cooperatives in new
selected areas nationwide. The main objective of this program is to help women located in rural areas to



- 18 -
start and develop their own entrepreneurial activities in handicrafts and cottage industries. This component
is expected to finance about 14,400 loans. This component (US$37 million) would represent about 3% of
total investment under the Project.
5.10          Land Consolidation Credit Program. The objective of this program, recently launched
by CNCA, is to give private farmers access to credit to purchase land as part of the Government adjustment
program for land policy initially supported by ASAL 11. The rationale for this is to promote the
establishment of economically viable production units through land consolidation and prevention of land
fragmentation. This program, which is not funded by the Bank (local cost component), would represent
about I % of total investment under the Project (US$7 million).
5.11          Lending to Youn  Entrepreneurs/Graduattis  This component is designed to provide
financing to young entrepreneurs/graduates to help them start their own enterprises. The component will
provide funds for farm and rural non-farm enterprises consisting of private small-scale enterprises/young
professionals (men and women) engaged or willing and capable to engage in farm or off-farm activities in
rural areas. This includes service cooperatives and trading services, crop transport, food processing, tractor
repairs and maintenance, input and spare parts supply, forest exploitation/reforestation and environmental
protection, and construction. CNCA will carefully select both farm and non-farm enterprises to be financed.
Tlis component (US$30 million) will finance about 435 loans and would represent 3% of total investment
under the project.

(b)   making fully operational the planning and management control unit reporting to CNCA's
Chief Executive Officer, and responsible for elaborating corporate objectives with the CEO,
communicating them to lower levels within the organization for implementation, managing
the planning process, and controlling results (Annex 12); and
(c)   further improvement of CNCA's MIS and accounting and expansion of computerizaion.
The Project would finance: (i) MIS softwares, data processing and office technology maintenance during a
three-year period at CNCA's Headquarters and branch level; and (ii) the related training needs (para. 5.13)
and consulting services as necessary (para. 5.14).
5.13         Lroject-Related Training. The Project would fund training by CNCA's Training Center
with the assistance of consultants. The pluri-annual training program already includes all the elements likely
to ease CNCA's institutional transition, i.e., courses in human resources management, marketing and
development, banking products and services, and applied technologies. Training will also include courses
in credit appraisal, environmental planning, and portfolio management for credit staff; accounting for middle
level and operational staff; planning, programming, MIS, management control, and communication skills
for senior staff; electronic data processing for computer staff and computer users; banking services for
branch managers and selected support staff; and risk management. The Project would also finance small
equipment, professional visits overseas for senior managers, and as necessary the recruitment of appropriate
training specialists (para. 5.14). A total of about 1,000 staff would be trained under the Project. Details
of the training objectives, plan and activities are available in Project working document No. 5.
5.14         Technical Assistane. Technical assistance could be of considerable help in speeding up
CNCA's refnrms and in training CNCA's top staff. This is particularly true for the planning process and
other organizational/MIS aspects, for CNCA's new banking services and for the launching of the pilot

climatic risk Insurance Fund. The Project would finance the expertise necessary to support CNCA's
reforms, Project implementation and training, up to a total of 15 man/months of consultants/ training
specialists. The total cost of consultants is estimated at US$0.5 million. Cofinancing funds (CFD) will also
be available.
5.15         Climaffc RNsk Moannent and Agricultural Insurnce Fund (not for Bank financing).
The project wouid assist the Government in establishing a climatic risk Insurance Fund (Fonds d'Assurance
Agricole contre les Calamites Naturelles - FAA) for the protection of farmers, and an agricultural insurance
scheme. The establishment of the proposed scheme would take place at the end of 1996 after two years of
pilot implementation in 1995 and 1996. An action plan for the Insurance Fund and its pilot implementation
would be presented to the Bank by October 1994 and would be based on the results of the technical study
and actuarial analysis prepared in May 1993 and reviewed in September and November 1993 using
workshops to build commitment. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Government would put
in place the Insurance Fund during project implementation and promote private agricultural insurance (paras.
6.12 and 6.14).
D. Project Cost Eslimates
5.16         ESmted Cost. The total Project cost is estimated at US$1,150 million equivalent,
including US$439 million equivalent (or about 39%) in foreign exchange and US$125 million equivalent in
related taxes and duties (11 %). Baseline estimates are expressed in 1994-96 current prices for the credit
component, and in September 1993 prices for the institutional development component. The credit
component is based on financial projections that take account of past lending and the increase in lending
expected under: (a) normal weather conditions (para. 4.35); (b) improved lending procedures (paras. 6.03
to 6.05), and (c) the expansion and diversification of CNCA's activities (para. 4.34). Subsectoral allocation
of fimds within CNCA lending programs is market-determined through an annual planning process and
scbeme approvals. The institutional component includes price and physical contingencies (the latter estimated
at 10% for office technology, computer maintenance and software), consultant and training costs. Detailed
cost estimates are presented in Annex 3 and are summarized in Table 5.1.

5.18           The proposed Bank Loan of US$100.0 million would be made to CNCA to finance part of:
(a) CNCA's lending operations (US$99 million); (b) office technology software and the maintenance of data
processing facilities (US$0.5 million); and (c) training programs and consultant services (US$0.5 million).
The Government would guarantee repayment, and foreign exchang, risk in accordance with a formula
established by the Government (para. 5.20). The Bank loan would be for 20 years, including five years of
grace, at the standard variable interest rate. Repayments of subloans not needed to service the Bank loan
woouid be recycled by CNCA for additional subloans.
5.19           The balance of foreign exchange requirements (US$339 million) would be provided in the
following manner: CFD (US$30 million), KfW (US$34 million), OECF (US$95 million), FADES (US$60
million), and EIB (US$60 million). The remainder (US$60 million) would come from CNCA's funds. ADB
is also interested in CNCA. Local currency costs would be financed by sub-borrowers' equity contribution
(US$340 million equivalent) and by CNCA's own resources (US$371 million equivalent). With regard to
the Project credit component, Table 5.3 provides a summary of the cofinanciers' lending terms and

Foreign cofinancing of the Project credit component including the Bank loan would amount to the equivalent
of US$377 million and would cover 86% of the foreign exchange requirements. The Bank loan would also
finance computer services and training. The OECF, FADES, EIB and CFD loan agreements were concluded
in 1993. Conclusion of the KfW loan agreement would be required before June 30, 1994.

be applicable to CNCA for its new loan (see Annex 6 paras. 6 and 7). Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the Government woald ensure that CNCA remains financially viable (para. 7.04) and
competitive as the result of the application of the 1991 foreign exchange risk coverage system.

5.22          Inrestmet fllanced by CNCA's loans. The goods and civil works to be financed under
the Project for on-farm and non-farm investments would not be suitable for bulk proement because of
their variety, the small size of individual investments, and the wide dispersion of contracts both in location
and time. Private dealers in Morocco sell and service a large variety of tractor makes and other farm
equipment and implements. Both the international suppliers market and private contractors and suppliers
are well represented. Competition is keen and prices competitive. Sub-borrowers would therefore purchase,
under CNCA supervision (para. 6.06), farm machinery and equipment from eligible sources of their choice
and commit civil works through existing local channds. As in the case of the Bank-financed FSDP which
supports the financing of the private enterprise sector in Morocco, procurement for the agro-industry
component would also be undertaken through existing local channels and according to normal commercial
practices in Morocco, where the inherent self-intrest of eligible competing companies has led to almost
universal competitive bidding or shopping.



- 23 -
5.23          ConsWQ a. Consultants and training specialists totalling about 15 man-months (US$0.5
million) would be appointed in accordance with Bank guidelines.
5.24         Other Procedures. MIS software, computer maintenance, and goods for training programs
(US$0.5 million) would be procured through local shopping involving quotations from at least three
suppliers, in accordance with Bank guidelines. These procedures are appropriate for the specialized nature
of the goods and services involved.
G. Disbursements
5.25         Disburs-ement Schedule. The proposed Bank ioan of US$100 million would be disbursed
over a period of about four Bank fiscal years. This is consistent with the historical disbursement profile for
agricultural credit projects in Morocco. A schedule of estimated disbursements under the proposed Bank
loan is summarized below and detailed in Annex 4:

- 24-
5.27         All disbursements (for computer/equipment maintenance, software, training costs and subloans
in categories 1-5) would be against certified Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Full documentation for SOEs
would be retained by CNCA for review by Bank supervision missions and would be reviewed and checked by
the external auditors (para. 6.15). Retroactive financing up to US$10 million (10% of loan amount) is
recommended for paymer.ts made for eligible expenditures approved by CNCA after April 1, 1993 (signing date
is expected by end December 1993). The amount retroactively financed would permit continuous contracting
for subloans, and training/consulting services so as to fill part of the financing gap between Loan 3088-MOR
and this operation. The loan closing date is March 31, 1998.
5.28         Bank Approval of CNCA Subloans. Subloans to agro-processing and fishery investors of
above DH 20 million (about US$2.2 million) would require Bank approval before financing.
5.29         The Revolving -Fnd. To facilitate the efficient and timely implementation of the Project, the
Bank would deposit, after loan effectiveness and at CNCA's request, an initial sum of US$10 million (about
four months estimated disbursements by CNCA) to set up a revolving fund in accordance with Bank guidelines.
The deposit would be made into a Special Account at a financial institution and under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMIENTATION
6.01         CNCA will be responsible for the implementation of the Project, and the Government will
provide its full support to CNCA and be accountable for the launching, on a pilot basis, of the climatic risk
Insurance Fund and agricultural insurrnce scheme.
A. Credit Onerations
Lending Proedures and Terms
6.02         Credit Guidelines. Purpose of CNCA subloans, subloan size and terms, interest and spread,
sub-borrower's contribution, collateral, appraisal and approval methods are detailed in the CNCA Credit
Guidelines (para. 4.14), which are available in the Project file.
6.03         Appraisal of Subloans to Farmers. Fishermen, Rural Women. Artisans and Othe Rural
Qpgaor. Investment lending to these categories of clients are subject to a technical-econouc, and financial
appraisal carried out by CNCA's field staff under the guidance of CNCA's Headquarters. Details are in Annex
14.
6.04         Appraisal of Subloans to Agro-Industrial Investors. CNCA uses an appraisal methodology
(Annex 14 para. 2) that is specifically designed for investment decisions in this sector, and conducts
environmental assessments.
6.05         Lendina for Rural Housinig. Through its CLCA offices, CNCA is well placed to finance the
housing needs of rural clients including women. Since 1987, CNCA is employing an engineer and an architect,
whose qualifications and experience are satisfactory to the Bank, to assist in appraising and supervising the
investments (see Annex 14).
6.06         Disbursement and Supervision of Subloans. Disbursement and supervision of subloans will
be handled by CNCA and its branch network as in previous projects (Annex 14, para. 4).

B. Women's Participation and Environmental Aspecs
6.07         Women's Paiciaton in Credit Aclivities. CNCA lends to women without prejudice, and
employs women on an equal footing with men. However, traditional family attitudes in some rural areas are
still a limiting factor for women's access to credit. As part of the preparation of the previous credit Project,
CNCA carried out a study in 1987 financed by USAID, on a CNCA pilot credit operation in the Province of
Khemisset to expand savings and credit for women clients. Study findings demonstrated that rural savings are
a key factor in improving women's access to credit. As a result, the Bank prepared a report in January 1988
to incorporate a rural women pilot project as part of Loan 3088-MOR to CNCA. The pilot project in Khemisset
was designed keeping in sight the main findings of this report:
(a)    women in Morocco perform a large part of agricultural, industrial and services work;
(b)   important conditions, besides access to credit, such as markets for their products and services,
access to technology and modern skills, group organization and networking are influencing the
scope of women's production; and
(c)    women in Morocco are showing a strong interest in credit and savings facilities despite several
constraints of a legal and financial nature, such as lack of collateral, land ownership, fiscal
income and identity card.
To implement the project, CNCA has assigned a few dedicated and highly qualified staff to develop its female
clientele and to make direct contacts with the target population. The artisanal industries are a particularly
mportant source of employment and income for women and are well developed in both rural and urban areas.
CNCA is now the only bank in Morocco that has disaggregated its clientele by sex, and the Khemisset project
has been successful in developing deposits and savings tenfold in the area from 1987 to 1989 and in tripling
them from 1989 to 1992. In addition, women receive high marks for loan recoveries. Under the Project, action
to promote rural savings and loan packages for women clients (para. 5.09) would be expanded in several
selected areas to help develop a combination of farm and non-farm activities which have shown a promising
trend in Khemisset (and in Rommani). The program will then be expanded nationwide. Details are given in
the Project working documents No 4. A sector report (No. 8536-MOR, September 1990) "Towards the
Increased Participation of Women in Societv" comments favorably on CNCA action to improve access of rural
women to credit. Building on the Morocco experience, the Bank is currently carrying out a sector study on the
role of rural women in Development in Maghreb, starting with Morocco, to enhance government strategies
aiming at improving the participation of rural women in the economic development process.
6.08         Environmental Aspects. Some regulations for environmental protection exist in Morocco and
provide for a certain degree of protection of the environment. The Moroccan authorities are also fully aware
of the Environmental Program for the Mediterranean, and understand the need to promote environmental
policies. Government, however, despite its enthusiasm for environmental considerations, does not yet have the
institutional capacity to catalogue, prioritize, and solve the environmental problems facing Morocco, from
potential locust invasion and desertification to industrial and urban pollution. After the Rio de Janeiro summit
on Environment and Development in 1991, the Government of Morocco moved forward by creating a Deputy-
Ministry for the Protection of the Environment within the powerful Ministry of Interior and Information. Under
the Project, CNCA would continue to pay special attention in its subloan appraisal to assessing the impact of
agriculturalagro- processing pollution and forestry degradation for the proposed investments that are likely to
raise major environmental issues. CNCA's experience shows that no major issues arose these past years. In
Morocco, in particular since 1988, it is current practice that agricultural products destined for export are subject
to EEC quality standards. No pesticides would be purchased under the proposed loan and CNCA advises
farmers to use only those chemicals considered safe under present conditions. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that CNCA staff in the agro-processing units are trained in properly evaluating the environmental
impact statements submitted as part of the subloan documentation when applicable.

C. CNCA Institutional Development
6.09         Implementation of CNCA's Organiational SrucuLre. Financial Performance, Planning
Process and MIS. The following set of actions and measures have been taken and others would be taken under
the Project to make it possible for CNCA to become a multi-purpose bank geared to rural finance:
(a)    Orgaization and Branch Network Regional Structure. Since the beginning of 1992, CNCA
has been implementing a new organization structure (see paras. 4.02 to 4.06). In addition,
CNCA is in the process of putting in place eight regional delegations (para. 4.05). During
project implementation, the Bank would supervise closely the setting-up of the eight regional
delegations so that at the end of the project period, (September 1997) they are all operational.
(b)    CNCA's Finanial Viability. CNCA 'as provided a financial performance development letter,
satisfactory to the Bank, with monitorable indicators aiming at maintaining minimum standards
as follows: (i) CNCA's capital adequacy as measured by the ratio of equity to risk assets to
remain at or above the 8% international standard"1 for commercial bank capitalization (para.
4.28); (ii) CNCA's liquidity as measured by the ratio of current assets to current liabilities12
to be maintained at not less than 1.2 to 1; (iii) CNCA annual profits to be sufficient to protect
the value of CNCA's net equity from inflationary erosion and to earn at least an average real
return on equity of 3% after the climatic risk Insurance Fund is operational; (iv) CNCA to
ensure that its CLCA branch offices maintain separate cost accounts and continue to produce,
globally each year, total revenues that cover at least the CLCA's total operating cost;
(v) CNCA's annual financial margin (interest income as a percentage of average net portfolio
outstanding minus interest expenses as a percentage of average borrowing outstanding and
deposits) to be maintained at not less than 2% as measured before June 30 in each fiscal year;
in addition, to protect CNCA's financial performance and viability, assurances were obtained
at negotiations that (vi) CNCA would maintain annually a maximum level of debt (over 18
months) to equity 13 of 10 to 1; and (vii) CNCA would maintain, at a minimum, positive real
interest rates (the rate of inflation would be measured by the annual producer price index
published by BAM). Interest rates and spreads would be monitored on an annual basis to verify
that CNCA's financial margin remains at not less than 2% (see para. 6.14 on Mid-Term Review
and para. 7.04, Table 7.1 on CNCA's financial indicators for 1992-96). The Government has
also provided a letter (viii) on financial measures as of beginning of 1994 in favor of drought-
stricken farmers and to maintain CNCA's financial viability as a consequence of the two-year
drought of 1992 and 1993 (transparent budget transfer of DH 150 million p.a. up to a
cumulated maximum of DH 1 billion). CNCA's annual profits, equity, and related financial
ratios would be calculated while ensuring that provisions against loan losses adequately reflect
risks with its loan portfolio and are in accordance with prudential regulations and advice of
BAM. However, since CNCA lends in an environment of periodic drought, the financial
indicators of this rural financial institution will be vulnerable to periods of downturn until a
fully implemented climatic risk sharing mechanism can be put in place (see para. 4.31).
(c)    Strategic and Operational Plann    and Manaemnt Control. In recent years CNCA has
demonstrated a good sense of overall direction and good operational and financial performance.
It needs to make fully operational appropriate mechanisms to carry out, on a systematic basis,
its strategic objectives, a corporate long-range development plan and its annual business plans.
The executive decision-making information and management control system being currently
developed (since March 1992) with the assistance of a reputable consulting firm, is an important
first step in the right direction. However, to be fully implemented, the process will need to be
11/   In 1992, CNCA's equity to risk assets ratio was 10%.
12/    In 1992, CNCA's current ratio was 1.8.
13/    In 1992, Debt/Equity ratio was 6.9.



- 27 -
institutionalized and CNCA-owned. Under the Project, CNCA would make fully operational,
by June 30, 1994, its Planning and Management Control system within a formally established
planning unit, which will be responsible for the following: (i) articulating corporate objectives
developed by Executive Management; (ii) making sure that the operational Departments and
Divisions and regional delegations are codtmitted to achieving planned results; (iii) ensuring that
plan requirements are met; (iv) managing the review process; (v) developing balance sheet and
earning forecasts and coordinating contingency planning; and (vi) controlling results including
the measurement of all aspects of CNCA's financial performance and condition including
subsidization. Details are in Annexes 11 and 12, and in working document no. 15.
(d)    Basic MES. Account  and EDP Systems. CNCA's present management information system
does not provide prompt feedback on operations. CNCA is well aware of the deficiencies in
its present accounting and information system, and of the magnitude of the task facing it to get
a sound MIS coherent with modern banking practices so that its activities and new products can
become fully competitive on a basis of quality of service and operating cost. Under Loan 3088-
MOR, CNCA management has started to overhaul the entire management infbrmation system.
Under the Project, CNCA would take further action to upgrade its data processing capability,
keeping in mind a potential client base of some 1.5 million. CNCA practical experience in
EDP should be used for managing the installation in its new Headquarters building of a
purchased MIS/EDP system (contract with an international consulting firm, specialized in data
processing for banks). Putting in place a new banking accounting plan and enhancing operating
procedures at CNCA is planned for January 1, 1995, in harmony with the new banking law
adopted by the Moroccan authorities as part of the FSDP. Under the proposed CNCA Project,
the Bank will closely supervise the process, so that by January 1997, the banking accounting
plan is fully operational at CNCA.
(e)    New Banking Services/Products and Diversificaton of Activitie. Since 1988, Government
has authorized CNCA to compete with the commercial banks for non-agricultural lending under
the same terms and conditions as those applied by commercW banks. This is an important step
in transforming CNCA into a full-service bank and in establishing a level playing field in the
banking sector in Morocco. In addition to loans, CNCA already offers deposit products in the
form of checking accounts, savings accounts (super carnets verts), fixed-term deposits, money
transfers, cashing of cheques and commercial bills, payment orders, addressing services, foreign
exchange and documentary credits. Marketing efforts are being undertaken to reposition CNCA
as a bank that specializes in rural finance as opposed to the past image of a
Government-sponsored farm credit institution. During Project implementation, the Bank would
carefully monitor the institutional strengthening undertaken by CNCA to introduce the tools and
techniques needed to carry out its expanded role, and to improve the operational and control
bases of current and anticipated activities.
6.10         Project-Rdated Taining. CNCA will be responsible for project-related training and would
use its own facilities and/or any other appropriate facilities that would be necessary to hold seminars in Rabat
or in other cities of the country. CNCA will also draw from its qualified trainers, and from its experience in
organizing training courses. As part of its proposed staff development program, CNCA would also organize
relevant training programs overseas for its most qualified staff and trainers, or would enter into a twinning
arrangement with a similar but more mature agricultural credit bank in another country. CNCA's pluri-annual
training plan for 1992-1995 and the 1993 program are acceptable to the Bank. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that CNCA will prepare, by October 31 of each year, an annual training program for the following
year acceptable to the Bank.
6.11         Construton of  eada_rters (not for Bank financing). At present, CNCA's Headquarters
staff is housed in ten different buildings scattered in various parts of Rabat. The lack of a modern Headquarters
office regrouping staff results in costly problems of communication among organizational units, waste of time,
managerial inefficiencies and makes it difficult to build up an adequate team spirit and sharp inmage of the
institution. CNCA has already obtained the land to build up its Headquarters and architectural plans have been



-28 -
drawn up. For the reasons above, the construction of the Headquarters is to be considered as a necessity and
not a luxury.
D. Agiutua Risk Mment ad  bM                  hind
6.12         The technical study on Agricultural Risk Management and Insurance Fund (Working Document
No.3B and Annex 13) will serve as the basis to develop and establish the proposed climatic risk Insurance Fund.
A workshop in Morocco during project launching with all agencies concerned will enable to discuss the
recommendations of the technical study and reach a consensus on the actions and details of the insurance
program to be launched on a pilot basis during project implementation in 1995 and 1996. On i ow and to what
extent the insurance program is implemented will be closely reviewed in connection with the nmid-term review
of the Project (para. 6.14).
E. hMoitoring and Evaluation
6.13         CNCA is in the process of implementing a comprehensive executive decision-making
information and management control system. Monitoring will become an integral part of the day-to-day
operational management of CNCA's activities at Headquarters and branch levels. CNCA's monitoring and
evaluation unit at Headquarters will collect and consolidate the data on commitments and disbursements under
subloans, physical achievements under selected subprojects, operational results of representative investment
operations, recovery performance, transaction costs, subsidies, financial ratios, and progress in deposit
mobilization. In turn, these data and the corresponding evaluation reports will enable CNCA to take actions
to remedy project implementation constraints, and to upgrade subloan appraisal, delivery, supervision and
repayment, assets/liabilities management, and financial results.
F.     ision  Mid-Term Review and Reportifg
6.14         Bank strategy for the spegrvision of project implementation and performance is spelled out in
Annex 15. As part of this strategy, the Government, CNCA and the Bank will carry out a joint Mid-Terim
Review of the project around May-June 1996. The review would: (i) monitor progress on implementation
performance of agreed objectives, financial indicators, and legal covenants; (ii) examine key actions taken by
the Government to launch and support implementation of the climatic risk management mechanism and
Agricultural Insurance Fund; (iii) evaluate CNCA's uses and sources of funding; (iv) assess CNCA's strateg
in light of its policy statement and the likely development impact and sustainability of the project at mid-tem
of its implementation; and (v) update, as necessary the implementation program of the project until completion.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations on the purpose and content of the mid-term review. On rporting,
CNCA wi'l provide to the Bank: (a) semi-annual progtess reports, within three months of the end of each
semester; these will include commitments, disbursements, subloan maturities and actual collections by category
of beneficiaries, CNCA's financial statements and results, changes in lending policies and procedures, and
progress being achieved in the implementation of the institution-building activities including the crop insurance
program; and (b) an annual evaluation report, within three months of the end of each calendar year. In
addition, CNCA wiil prepare its part of a combined Inplemenation Completion Report (ICR) on Loan 3088-
MOR and this loan, to be submitted to the Bank within three months of the closing date of this loan.
G. Accounts and Audit
6.15         CNCA has a relatively reliable accounting system involving: (a) a centralized accounting
system; (b) an internal audit unit; (c) a stable and qualified work force in terms of key financial staff; (d)
separation of incompatible tasks; (e) defined procedures; (1) timeliness in producing annual financial statements
of satisfactory quality; and (g) few external audit adjustments. During Project implementation, CNCA will
further improve and modernize its system by: (a) implementing, as of January lst, 1995, a new chart of



-29 -
account4 incorporatig improved standards for bank accounting consistent with the now banking law; and
(b) developing decentralized MIS and EDP applications, in particular for detaied cost accountig purposes at
branh level. In the past, CNCA accounts and financial statements have been audited annually by independet
auditors (Price Watewhouse) acceptable to the Bank and this includes the audit of CNCA 1992 accounts and of
Loan 3088&MOR. This practice would continue under the Project. CNCA will send to the Bank, within six
montis of the close of each fiscal year, a full audit report. This will incorporate in one document with the
auditors' opinions: (a) a management letter; and (b) a long-form report on CNCA's overal financl statemnts
and project accounts with four specific auditors' opinions on (i) CNCA accounts, (ii) project accounts, (iii)
Statemets of Expendiures (SOEs), and (iv) the revolving fund (Special Account), if applicable. CNCA will
sewd to the Bank audit reports of adequate international standards. Report contents will be discussed with
CNCA and the auditors during Bank supervision missions.
VU. B        .   QEiCAlO AND RIS
A. Bnefits and Justifiaton
7.01         The proposed Project would provide part of the financing and institutional framework necessary
for the private sector (m particular small- and medium-scale farmers) to respond to the improving policy
environment, including the opening of external markets. It would help achieve a vital transition in CNCA's
insttional development and ongoing conversion into a full-service bank while promoting entry of other banls
ito rural finance by improving conditions for a level playing field. This would improve Morocco's instiutional
abilities to promote private sector investment in rural areas, and increase domesdc savings nationwide. Through
provision of investment credit to private farmers, agro-industries, and other oprators, the Project would also
contribute to increased production and productivity, exports, and rural employment while increasing competition
among banks and reducing pressure for public investment. By developing crop insurance and building the
foundations for an Agricultural Insurance Fund, it would assist farmers in managing risk and reduce the
hardship and budgetary costs of periodic droughts. This, in turn, would impact favorably on Morocco's
ecowmic and social goals.
7.02                FJ lpona Beneiciaries. The projected impact of the Project on farmers' and
investors' incomes would be substantial at full development. Under the best conditions, fiancial rates of return
(FRR) vary from 25% to 50% for the seven investments models analyzed: five farm models, one fishing
investment and one ardsanal industry. These FRRs, however, are very sensitive to decreasing profits or
increasing costs. Detailed analysis and results are in Working Document No. 11.
7.03         Edc              . Similarly, an economic rate of return (ERR) has also been calculated for
each typical investment model. ERRs also vary from 25% to 50% but with some differences with the FRRs
depending on the model analyzed. The results have not been aggregated into an overall ERR for the Project
as a whole, because the distribution of loans among these types of investment or among variations of the models
wUi depend on changing relative prices, attractiveness of alternative inestments, land use, and market forces.
Details are in Working Document No. 11.
7.04         Fna l Impact on CNCA.  Projected financial statements for 1993-1996, with key

The table shows that CNCA is expected to maintain its underlying financial health and earnings capacity on
condition that there is no major change in foreseen domestic inflation rates, real interest rates or foreign
exchange rates. While aital adgeqacy would remain above the 8% of risk assets that is generally being
adopted as the international standard for commercial bank capitalization, the trend line could be worrisome if
CNCA's capital base is not increased. Not increasing the capital could force a reduction in CNCA's support
for rural finance. Under the Project, financial objectives have been proposed to maintain CNCA's financial
soundness (para. 6.09 (b)j and to increase its capital. Regarding retumn on qity, performance dipped sharply
in 1992-consistent with a rural institution undergoing major itrnal change at a time of adverse cdimatic
conditions-but then is expected to rise again in the years to come. Liuidt, defined as current assets divided
by current liabilities (with current assets equal to liquid assets plus short-term risk assets minus provisions on
short-term risk assets), is expected to remain constant at about 1.7 which is adequate. In terms of growth,
CNCA would amply benefit from the support of the international financial community, and CNCA finacial
improvements would stem from the combined results of: (a) sharper increases in interest incomes than in
interest expenses; (b) improved quality of portfolio (collections and adequate provisions); and (c) continued
increases in deposits as reflected in the improving trends in the ratios of deposits to loans. This projected
growth of deposits is achievable because (i) the total deposit market in Morocco is expanding; (ii) CNCA's
market share in 1992 was still low (about 5% of the total deposit market), and (iii) CNCA is authorized since
1988 to compete with other banks to raise off-shore deposits. For CNCA to implement the Project is therefore
financially justified. CNCA's financial indicators, in particular the liquidity, debt to equity, and capital
adequacy ratios (para. 6.09(b)) will have to be closely monitored during Project implementation and the mid-
term review to prevent or correct any deteriorating trends.
7.05          Financal Implications for Government'5. The impact of the Project on the Government's
finances would come from: (a) capital subsidies paid to small farmers clients of CNCA to finance 3% of the
cost of selected on-farm investments in accordance with the Agricultural Investment Code (Annex 8); (b) interest
rebates on social rural housing loans; (c) taxes and duties on imports, farm assets, fishing boats and
agro-processing equipment; (d) budget transfers to compensate CNCA for the foreign exchange risk losses
II/ The remaining dependence of CNCA on direct and indirect subsidies would be monitored durnng project
implementation (pam. 6.09 (c)) usig a Subsidy Dependence Index developed by the Bank, and to be custom-
tailored to CNCA (Annex 16).



- 31 -
resulting from the application to CNCA of the 1991 risk coverage system (para. 5.20); and (e) part of the
administrative costs of the climatic risk Insurance Fund (FAA). Investment subsidies under the Project for (a)
above are estimated to equal US$11.0 million and are partly financed out of the ASIL and of an EEC grant to
the Agricultural Development Fund (FDA). Interest rebates on social housing in rural areas are estimated at
US$0.3 million p.a. during three years. Import duties and other taxes are estimated to amount to about US$125
million equivalent, or about 11% of the total Project cost. Budget transfers for exchange risk losses are
estimated at US$20 million covering a three-year period. Administrative costs for the FAA are estimated at
about DH 10 million p.a. (US$1.1 million for premium subsidy, and at DH 1.3 million p.a. (US$145,000) for
administration (Annex 13). These costs are cheaper than facing a financial crisis each time a major drought
occurs in Morocco. For example, 1993 budget allocations to cushion the impact of recent droughts on farmers
clients of CNCA amounted to DH 650 million or US$70 million. It is also worth noting that the Project, by
supporting rural finance development has a positive indirect impact on the export revenues of Morocco on
agricultural and food products, which represented about US$1,100 million and 31% of total exports in 1991.
The Project, which is also encouraging exports, is expected therefore to have a positive impact on the
Government's finances in the long run.
B. Proect Risks
7.06         Agicultural Risk Manafement. The major risk in this Project is the threat of severe drought
and/or sustained drought conditions such as those Morocco has experienced these past years, in 1980-81 and
1983-84 in particular and again in 1991-92 and 1992-93. Adverse weather conditions translate into decreased
yields and livestock output, reduced demand for agricultural investments and services, reduced production of
raw materials for processing or conditioning, lower farm incomes, reduced ability to repay loans, and decreasing
amounts of rural savings collected. These droughts seem to occur every five years or so. Droughts create
problems in credit recoveries and might warrant writing off arrears or rescheduling farmers' debts. On the basis
of past and current experience this risk has not adversely affected CNCA long-term viability, partly because
of CNCA's prudent lending policies, collection methods, provisions for bad debts and the support of the
international donor community. For example, USAID and EEC provided CNCA with financial assistance in
1984-85 to cushion the effect of the drought with the injection of fresh cash (US$13.5 million and an equivalent
US$29 million, respectively). This has allowed CNCA to roll over the short-term debt into a medium-term
rescheduled repayment for those farmers most affected by the drought (in certain geographic areas). For the
1992 drought, CNCA and the Government took measures in August 1992 to cushion its impact (Annex 7, Table
12B). For the 1993 drought, strong measures were authorized in March 1993 to stabilize rural income and
employment and to maintain CNCA's financial viability. The Project will set the stage for a long-term approach
to drought management as the Government has agreed to establish the FAA.
7.07         Other Risks.  Another important risk in this Project is associated with the current
transformation of CNCA from an agricultural credit institution into a universal, full service bank. The success
of this endeavor depends upon CNCA's ability to provide its clients with services of a quality at least equal to
the one of its new competitors, mainly the commercial banks. This implies substantial changes in the work
habits and the attitude of all CNCA's staff. It also requires significant organizational changes which are now
in progress. The financial strengthening of CNCA must also succeed for CNCA to become a sustainable
institution. These risks are currently under control because of the quality of CNCA's current management.
However, it is important that this quality and continuity in the management of CNCA be maintained, so that
reforms can succeed and open the door, in the long run to some elements of possible privatization when the
regionalization process of CNCA is more advanced.
VIII. AGREEME1S REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION

1.            Of the approximately 1.9 million farms in Morocco, 480,000 (24%) have a fiscal income of less
thn DR 50' and only about 9% of them are eligible for credit. In 1991, about 564,S00 individual farmers had
an active file with CNCA. This correspotds to 38.2% of the total number of CNCA's potential farm clients. In
addition, it is estimated that another 100,000 farmers were receiving credit through Agraian Reform Cooperatives
and ORMVAs. Between 1988 and 1991, the number of credit applications for both CLCA and CRCA clients
declined from 236 930 to 217 765 p.a Total lending, however, has increased substantially. Average loan amounts
increased by 24% to DH 5,088 for CLCA clients and by 200% to DH 93,549 for CRCA and other clients.
Compared to -ny other coumnties, firm credit coverWe for small farmers is high in Morocco, but not yet at fill
potential.
2.            About 70% of potential CRCA clients, but only 35f% potential CLCA clients were receiving credit
in 1991. A 2% increase since 1987 for CRCA clients, and an 8% inrease for CLCAs. For the latter, CNCA
penetration was relativey high for farns having an Fl in the DH 1,600-6,000 range (which corresponds to
approximately 5 ha to 15 ha of rainfed land). However, very few marginal farmers with an Fl below DH 1,600
(about 5 ha rainfed land) were actual CNCA clients, reflecting their low borrowing capacity and their lack of
participation in the monetized economy. The increase in the number of CNCA clients has followed the expansion
of the network of CRCA and CLCA offices, but certain upper limit may have been reached. In 1973, there were
21 CRCAs and 54 CLCAs; in 1977, 24 and 88 respectively; in 1987, 44 and 108; in 1991, 50 and 122. During
this period the number of CLCA clients has increased at an average rate of 15% p.a.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
ALnicultural Sector Performance. Goverment Stt    and
Sectora! Iss   Relevant to Rural Flnance
1.          Background. Of Morocco's total land area of 60 million ha, 8 million ha or 13% is
suitable for agriculture. Of the cultivated land, about 50% receives good but inconsistent rainfall, and
rainfed cultivation remains largely traditional with cereals and pulses as the dominant crops. About I
million ha or 12% of the cultivated land are irrigated growing mostly cereals, fruits, vegetables, forage
and industrial crops. The remaining half of the cultivated land receives an erratic rainfall of less than
400 mm and can only be put under low value crops and fallow. About 20 million ha in semi-arid or
mountain regions of the country is only suitable for grazing and forests. Given the high variability in
rainfall and periodic droughts, the Government concentrated its efforts on developing a modern irrigated
sector. Considerable progress has been made in farming techniques and yields in this sector, and the
current emphasis is on water conservation measures.
2.           Past Performance. After a period of slow growth in the 1970's when agriculture grew
at only an average of 2.4% p.a., the growth rate increased considerably during the 80's to 6.7% p.a.
This acceleration in growth was largely due to favorable weather conditions since 1985 and policy
changes brought about as part of the Medium-Term Agricultural Sector Adjustment Program (MTASAP).
Food production, however, has not kept pace with the increased domestic demand generated by a
combination of rapid population growth (2.6% p.a) and a high rate of urbanization (4.5% p.a.), and food
inports have increased.
3.           Although the agricultural sector in general is still characterized by a low farm
productivity, it has considerable untapped growth potential. It can play a key and dynamic role in the
growth of Morocco's economy. A major proportion of this growth will be generated through private
sector investments largely through improvements in on-farm water use efficiency and additional public
investment in basic irrigation infrastructure. It is essential that the Government follows a growth strategy
which stimulates private on-farm investment and cost effective public investment in infrastructure and
agricultural services. At the same time, the Goverment is mindful of the dual nature of Moroccan
agriculture with relatively prosperous areas of high technology agriculture contrasting with poorer rainfed
areas practicing traditional forms of cultivation. Growthwith consideration to the poverty that exists in
certain regions of the country is the balanced approach to agriculture and rural development being sought
by the Government and the Bank.

ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 5
4.            Government Strategy. The Government's objective in the agricultural sector is to promote
efficiency in the sector by encouraging a more active involvement of the private sector in input supply,
support services, marketing and agro-processing, streamlining the use of public resources and reducing
the burden of agricultural price policies on the Government's budget. The Government's Agricultural
Sector Adjustment Program, the MTASAP, was supported by the Bank through two Agricultural Sector
Adjustment Loans (ASAL I and 11). Certain reforms are still being supported under an Agricultural
Sector Investment Loan (ASIL) and a second ASIL is under preparation.
5.            The key objectives of the Government's medium-term adjustment program in agriculture
are to:
(a)    restructure the public investment and expenditure programs towards high return
investments, provide adequate funds for the operation and mainitenance of the existing
productive infrastructure, and increase private sector financing through increased lending
by CNCA;
(b)    strengthen agricultural support services needed to be provided by the Government while
privatizing others;
(c)    improve productivity of land use and management of the country's natural resources;
(d)    build up institutional capacity for agricultural policy planning and analysis and improve
capability in monitoring and evaluation of sector performance; and
(e)    improve resource allocation and re-orient the prices and incentives structure to encourage
shifts towards the production of crops and livestock products for which Morocco has a
comparative advantage.
6.            Despite impressive achievements, more needs to be done to ensure the sustainability
of sector performance, and further Bank support will be needed to reach the final objectives set out in
the MTASAP.
7.            Institutional Credit and Private Investment. In agriculture, private investment now
accounts for about 59% of total investment, of which 70% is financed by CNCA'. CNCA lending is
targeted to both irrigated and rainfed areas. To carry out its strategy of gradual privatization of the
economy, Government plans to reduce its own investments in agriculture. Private investors are
turning chiefly to CNCA to finance their investments in on-farm and market level storage, farm
mechanization, field irrigation facilities and agro-industry.
J/     The rest is mainly self-financing by investors with some lending by commercial banks, Which is
primarily short-term and to agro-industries. The commercial banks in Morocco, despite record profits, are
not willing to take the risk of lending to farmers and are not organized for financing on-farm investments

8.           Poverty and LOw Debt Service Capacity of Rural Families. Some constraints exist
to expanding CNCA credit to farmers. One is the limited savings and debt service capacity of many
rural families with rainfed farms of less than 7 ha, which represent about 75% of the total number of
farmers eligible for credit. A majority of these rural families operate at or near subsistence level,
generate very few financial surpluses, and cannot accumulate significant savings and invest without
credit. But their debt capacity is minimal and prevents them from having full access to institutional
credit. The village level branch network of CNCA, "Caisses Locales de Cr6dit Agricole (CLCAs)"
serve smaller scale farmers, with fiscal income DH 50 - 6,000. In term of credit coverage, the extent
of CNCA's penetration in rural areas is relatively high for farms of more than 7 ha (75% of potential
clients), but only 30% of potential smaller farms are receiving credit. In addition, because many
farmers do not hold documented title to their land, CNCA's established lending criteria have been
based on a notion of fiscal income (i.e., income estimated to be derived from existing land holdings
plus livestock) and have resulted in credit extension to only a limited proportion of small farmers and
for smaller than requested amounts. To increase accessibility of farmers to credit, particularly in
rainfed areas, CNCA has begun to expand its branch network, to open seasonal credit outlets, and to
develop a new credit policy on eligibility, based on the direct assessment of farmers' credit needs and
creditworthiness. CNCA will implement this credit policy, while making sure that it does not add
more risk to the CNCA portfolio. Efforts are also underway to assess the savings capacity of small
farm families. With the 1992 and 199 droughts, however, farmers face additional liquidity
difficulties that have a negative impa, on their debt service and savings capacity.
9.           Deposits and Savings Mobilization. CNCA has started to implement a medium- and
long-term strategy to increase voluntary savings mobilization under Loan 3088-MOR for 1989-92 and
this strategy would be further supported under the follow-up Project (paras. 4.29 and 6.09 (e) of main
report).
10.          AMroindustrial Development2. In recent years agroindustries, complementary to
primary agricultural productions, have developed at a rapid pace in Morocco. Between 1986 and
1990, investments by enterprises in the sector rose at an annual tate of 21.5% and, in 1990, reached
DH 2 billion or 31 % of total industrial investment. Most investments were carried out for the
extension of existing activities rather than for the creation of new enterprises. The sugar agro-
industry and the processing of fruits and vegetables predominate in terms of gross capital formation.
11.          Banking services to agroindustries are provided by CNCA, and by commercial and
other banks currently supported by a Bank loan (FSDP). Lending interest rates have been virtually
liberalized with two exceptions, the first one being export pre-financing. The second exception is
rediscounting in

favor of commercial banks only, on direct medium-term investment loans at 12% to small-scale
enterprises. Other interest rates are freely determined within a ceiling which is set at 2.5 percentage
points above the weighted average interest rate on six and twelve-month bank deposits and is adjusted
by the Central Bank every six months.
12.          As of December 31, 1991, outstanding short-term and investment credit to
agroindustrial enterptises amounted to DH 4.2 billion, excluding small loans of less than DH 100,000
each, mostly made by CNCA. Until 1987, CNCA's lending to agroindustrial enterprises was rather
small at DH 145 million. However, in 1988 credit approval increased almost six-fold to about DH
900 million. This significant increase was largely due to CNCA's move into the competitive market
of short-term financing of enterprises doing business in the marketing of cereals. By 1991, the annual
volume of loans approved to the agroindustrial sector, including the cereals subsector, exceeded DH 2
billion (UJS$241 million). In 1991-92, about 80% of these CNCA's loans were short-term credits
financed at market terms and conditions out of CNCA's own resources, mainly for the
commercialization of cereals, the sugar subsector and the grain mill and bakery subsector. Under
Loan 3088-MOR, CNCA committed US$ 25 million to finance medium- and long-term investments
for agro-processing and wood-processing enterprises. As of December 1992, CNCA used 100% of
that amount to finance a total of 35 projects.
13.           Land Tenum. Major land tenure issues in Morocco include:
(a)  fragmentation of farms which reduces the efficiency of operation of the larger ones
and contributes to the reduced viability of smaller ones;
tJb)  lack of clear land titles which inhibit many farmers from seeking long-term credit,
and discourage investment in land improvements;
(c)  insecurity of land tenure for tenant farmers reducing their incentive to invest in farm
assets and to conserve the soil; and
(d)  absentee land ownership resulting in under-use of resources and the tendency for the
land collectively owned to be poorly managed and over-exploited causing low
productivity.
The Government has taken measures to correct these problems, by on-going programs of land
consolidation and issuance of land titles. CNCA is providing credit for land acquisition, land
consolidation and improvements, and land registration operations.
14.           Clhc Rislc. Agricultural production is faced with high risk due to the variability
of rainfall. Cereals produced under rainfed conditions are the most sensitive to the onset of drought.
A vast majority of farmers grow cereals and there has been a significant increase in the area grown to
cereal during the five good years before the 1992 drought. Of the total area



- 44 -
ANNEX S
Page 5 of 5
of agricultural land of 8,944,100 ha (including fallow of 1,906,800 ha), 5,490,800 ha or 59% is
grown to cereal. Of the total cereal area, 4,243,000 ha or 77% are predominantly rainfed. Some of
these areas are the most sensitive to drought. National cereal average yields have fluctated from as
low as four quintals to as high as 15 quintals per ha. As a result, total annual production has ranged
from as low as 16.4 million quintals to as high as 85.3 quintals. Other crops grown under rainfed
conditions are at risk of being affected in a similar fashion. This variability in production has major
implications on financial stability and on the capacity of farmers to service their debt. This has in
turn a direct impact on the financial performance of banking institutions serving agriculture,
principally CNCA. To correct this, the Government will create an agricultural insurance fund (para.
5.15 of main report).
15.           Bank ProjectS in AgXriculure (29 Projects). Bank group lending in agriculture
include nine irrigation projects: Sidi Slimane (FY65), Sebou (FY70), Souss Groundwater (Y75),
Doukkala I (FY76) and n (FY77); Small- and Medium-Scale Irrigation Projects (FY83, FY88) and
Large-Scale Irrigation Improvement I (FY86) and n (FY93); seven agricultural credit irolecs and
five rainfed agricultural development projects, in the Meknes (FY75), Loukkos (FY80), Fes-Karia-
Tissa (FY79), Middle-Atlas (FY82) and Oulmes Rommani (FY83) areas; an aro-industrial and flood
control project (Sebou nI FY74); a Vegeble and Marketing Project (FY80); and a FQrggiarojiect
(FY82), all completed. An Ariculturad Research and Extension (FY89) and a Erey.ProEject
(FY90) are on-going.

The  mnanial Sector
1.      Commercial and SaM       Banks. At the end of 1991, the assets of the fifteen commercial
banks totalled DH 131.8 billion (US$14.6 billion equivalent). The three largest commercial banks
account for 60% of total assets. The assets of the four medium-size banks represents 29% of total bank
assets and eight smaller banks account for 11 % of total assets. The commercial banks have a combined
network of 936 branches which are unevenly distributed geographically: 25% of all branches are located
in Casablanca where about one third of all deposits are collected and another 50% of the branches are
in cities along the Atlantic coast.
2.      In 1991, commercial banks extended DH 54.2 billion in credits to the economy (or 58% of
total credit), of which about 79% were short-term. In spite of Government encouragement, banks have
been cautious in extending investment credit, partly because of the possibility of making higher profits
at lower risk on short-term lending. However, in recent years they have increased their investment
lending activities, in particular in the profitable urban housing and industry sectors. At the end of 1991,
the commercial banks' medium- and long-term lending (DH 11.7 billion) represented (a) 30% of total
medium- and long-term credits to the economy, (b) 19% of their sight deposits (DH 61.8 billion), and
(c) 39% of their term deposits (DH 30.4 billion). By comparison, at the end of 1987 their medium- and
long-term lending accounted for: (a) only 12% of total tmedium- and long-term credits to the economy,
(b) 11 % of their sight deposits, and (c) 25% of their term deposits. About 30% of all commercial bank
deposits originated from Moroccan immigrant workers with the Banque Populaire taking the lead on this
activity.
3.      Commercial banks participate, under the control of the MF in the syndicated financing of the
production and marketing operations of state-owned agricultural enterprises. In principle, they also offer
seasonal and investment credit to individual farmers. However, their agricultural lending to individual
farmers is minimal because:
(a)  their branches are mostly located in urban centers along the coast;
(b)  they avoid making small loans with relatively high processing costs;



- 46 -
ANNE 6
Page 2 of 3
(c)  they lack adequately trained agricultural staff; and
(d)  their lending is usually restricted to bortowers who also keep sizeable deposit balances and
offer sufficient guarantees.
Further details are in working document no. 16.
4.        pCredit hS. Specialized credit institutions account for the bulk of
medium- and long-term lending. In 1991, they provided about DH 26 billion or 70% of all medium- and
long-term credit to the economy (DH 37 billion). CNCA's share in total credit distributed by specialized
financial institutions was about 16% in 1991 (DH 5 billion, out of which DH 2.0 billion medium- and
long-term lending). Since 1984, credit extended by these institutions has grown at an average annual rate
of about 12% (in current terms), at the same rate as total credit to the economy. CNCA's annual growth,
after levelling in 1988 and 1989 peaked at above 20% in 1990, and 1991, but fell in 1992 as the result
of recent droughts. CNCA is expected to grow again from 1993-96.
5.       unancial Sector Policies and Reforms. Details are in Annexes 9A and 9B.
6.      Treatment of Foreign Exchange Risk. Under Loan 3088-MOR to CNCA with the guarantee
of the Gov_rnment, a foreign exchange risk scheme was established under the letter No. 3/3789 dated
May 9, 1989 from the Minister of Finance to the CEO of CNCA, establishing the level of participation
of CNCA in foreign exchange losses. Under this 1989 system, the risk is shared in the manner described
below:
(a) CNCA bears full cost of the foreign exchange losses incurred from variations of up to 2% in
the foreign exchange rate on its non concessionary foreign borrowings contracted before
December 31, 1988;
(b) a Foreign Exchange Risk Fund in the name of the Treasury is maintained on CNCA's books
into which CNCA deposits: (i) the proceeds of a commission of 1 % charged, as of January
1, 1989, on medium- and long-term loans with the exception of loans for rural housing and
of all loans made by the CLCAs; and (ii) the excess of CNCA's average lending rate (10.5 to
11.5%) over the non concessionary interest rates on foreign borrowings plus a margin to
assure adequate profitability. This margin is 3 % for the non concessionary borrowings, except
those for CLCAs, contracted before January 1, 1989, and 2% after January 1, 1989, including
CLCAs. Any losses on non concessionary lending in excess of those covered by the Risk Fund
would be borne by the Government;



- 47 -
ANNEX6
Page 3 of 3
(c) the exchange risk generated by the ongoing concessionary borrowings (KfW, EEC and
USAID) and those to be contracted, would be covered 100% by CNCA. CNCA will make
all necessary provisions for risk to this effect.
In September and November 1992, Government settled its 1990 and 1991 foreign exchange arrears to
CNCA.
7.      In 1991, the Government established a new foreign exchange risk coverage scheme pursuant
to the letter dated May 30, 1991 from the Ministry of Finance, for the Moroccan banks to protect
themselves against the risk of foreign exchange losses. The system introduces a reference rate to equate
the cost of domestic and foreign capital which is the difference between the weighted average cost of
commercial banks' 6 and 12-month deposit rates (11.7% end 1992) plus 0.75% fee and, for example,
the Bank variable rate. The 1991 system has been incorporated into the loan documents of the FSDP
which were signed in November 1991 by BNDE and seven participating commercial banks.

(b)   Interest on Deposits. They are based on current cost of 5.2% in 1993 and 5.5% thereafter to
reflect current increase of these funds.
(c)    One- year Solidarity Bonds subscribed by comnmercial banks at current rate of 4.25% a year.
(d)    Othe Financial Co   include commitment fee on foreign loans, commissions on banking
transactions and payments to Government on the basis of current foreign exchange risk coverage
regulations. The latter are as follows, on the basis of early 1993 exchange rates.

3.    AdministrativeExpenses
A yearly increase of 12% per year over 1992 expenses is assumed. This is consistent with past jrend and
reflects the cost of diversifying CNCA activities and efforts to attract local depositors, modernize data
processing and services to customers.
4.    Provision for Credit Risk
It is assumed that CNCA would continue to build provisions for credit risk at the same rate as previous
years to comply with new banking law regulations. In 1996, provisions would cover arrears at 50%
instead of 40% today. Arrears of more than one year would therefore be covered at 100%. Yearly
provisions would amount to 7% of yearly disbursement, thus fully covering credit risks on the basis of
past experience over the last eight years.
B.    SOURCES AND APPLICATIONS OF FUNDS
(a)   Increase in Deposits. Figures for 1992 and 1993 were affected by the drought years. As from
1994, increase in deposits are assumed to increase at the rate experienced before drought years.
(b)   Increase in Equity. It is the result of the proposed injection of the KfW's new loan to
Government into CNCA's equity.

Page 3 of 3
(c)    KfW Reserved Interests. The yearly increase reflects the difference between reserved interests
accrued each year and the use of that funding to cover exchange rate differences on KfW funds.
(d)    Foreign Exchange Risk Incremental Cost. Government committed itself in March 1993 to
compensate by a budget transfer (subsidy to farmers) the increase of CNCA cost of funds due
to the application to CNCA as of 1993 of the 1991 system for foreign exchange risk coverage
so as to maintain CNCA's nominal on-lending rates to farmers at their current (relatively high)
level. A payment of DH 190 milliois over a three-year period is planned and would be used from
1993 to 1996.

B. RECOVERIES AT MNCA - DETAILED ANALYSIS
1.          Key indicators on CNCA loan recovery for 1985 to 1992 are summarized below:

Al On principal due and overdue after payment of interest due.
h/ As of end December 1992 Arears/Loans ratio is about 30%, with provisions covering 40% of
arrears (100% of arrears of more than 18 months).
g/ As computed in May 1993 for .11 past yeats, with a recoveiy rats reahing 95% for 198485.
2.           These figures do not mean that CNCA is lax and this Is proven by the average 95% real
recovery rate in 1984/85 and 93% in 1985/86. They include the balance of every loan graned since
CNCA's creation in 1961 and even previous loans inherited from agencies active before 1961. CNCA
recognizes its risk at DH 1.8 billion set aside in dubious debtor accounts. Measures to increase loan
collection-after writing off uncollectible arrears if necessary and rescheduling certain debts in case of
drought, like in 1985 and 1992 - include the application of the "Privilege dEtat"1 which has been
revitalized by CNCA in 1987/88, deducting loan repayments from crop payments, denying fiter credk
to borrowers in arrears, and realization of security.
},/  The "Privil#ge d'Ntat" or "Privilege du TrGsor" is a forceful measure
enforced by law, which has been granted to CNCA on a permanent basis to
help recorery of loans from farm clients in delinquency.

3.            Short-term loans are recovered faster but it takes three years to recover 93% of amounts
due. The loans the most difficult to recover are those granted by CLCAs: there is a lag of two years to
reach the level of CRCAs recovery rates. Yearly recovery rates have deteriorated due to the massive
rescheduling of end 1985 due to previous droughts (1982-1984). The 1991-92 crop season, again, was
struck by a drought of unseen magnitude, and this has affected current recovery rates (66% of amounts
due in 1992 and 20% of overdues). A second drought hit Morocco in 1992-93.
4.           In August 1992, CNCA took a series of actions to improve the situation. Erst CNCA
advertized widely a plan to induce the repayment of arrears by cancelling penalties and interest surcharges
due on old arrears by farmers who reimiburse them by December 31,1992. Preliminary results at the end
of October 1992 were encouraging, antd CNCA has extended the measure up to June 30, 1993. CNCA
estimates that it would recover this way about DH 0.5 billion of arrears due since the end of 1991 (15%).
Second, selective rescheduling is contemplated only for farmers affected by the drought, i.e. those who
had seasonal and medium-term credit for rainfed production (mainly cereals). Rescheduling would be
granted to all CLCA clients, with the provision that those not affected by the drought would repay at least
50% of amounts due in 1992. For CRCA clients, only seasonal credits for rainfed production in non-
irrigated areas would be carried forward. Medium- and long-term credits would be rescheduled on a case
by case basis provided that farmers repay at least 15% of amounts due in 1992 in the twelve drought-
stricken provinces and 35% in other provinces.
5.           CNCA plans to reschedule medium- and long-term loans for a total of DH 1.9 billion and
to carry forward DH 1.7 billion due in 1992. At the end of 1992, a total amount of DH 1.6 billion
would still remain as arrears.
6.           In March 1993, the Chief of State of the Kingdom of Morocco took additional measures
to cushion a second consecutive drought. This includes DH 110 million (US$ 12.2 million) of
Government subsidies to 120,000 small farmers for loan rescheduling, DH 350 million (US$ 38 million)
to stabilize rural income and employment of 350,000 small farm families, and DH 190 million (US$ 20
million) to maintain CNCA's financial viability by covering for three years (1993-95) the negative impact
of the 1991 foreign exchange risk coverage scheme now applied to CNCA for its new borrowings.

The Agricultural Development Fund I
1.           The Agricultural Development Fund (FDA) was created with the 1986 Law of Finance
and its basic text was published in the official Gazette of Morocco (Bulletin Ofriciel no. 3818, issued
January 1, 1986, page 23 Title II, Article 3, Permanent Dispositions for the Creation of a Special
Account no. 35-52 called Agricultural Development Fund). Details are in the working document No.
8. The FDA Special Account is open at the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MARA) and
the necessary funds are earmarked in the Government's investment budget. CNCA is responsible for
administering the Fund.
2.           The key objective of the FDA is to provide some capital subsidies for selected private on-
farm investments in accordance with the Agricultural Investment Code. This code and the FDA aim at
encouraging agricultural production, in particular small farm production in disadvantaged rural areas, with
a view to increasing farmers' income and reducing rural migration into overpopulated urban centers.
Capital subsidies finance about 10% to 30% of the total cost of the investment, but do not eliminate the
entirety of the downpayment usually required from farmers to obtain medium- or long-term loans through
CNCA's branch offices. Government funds are channelled to the selected beneficiaries for their
applicable investments through CNCA's credit operations. Interest rates for these credit operations are
not subsidized.
3.           To ensure that CNCA is adequately compensated for the administration of the FDA, the
Ministry of Finance agreed in September 1986 to pay to CNCA a fee of a sufficient level to cover
CNCA's related administrative costs. This agreement, which is satisfactory to CNCA and to the Bank,
is being enforced since end-1986. Under the Project, the amount of capital subsidies to be financed out
of the FDA is estimated at DH 99.2 million (US$ 11.0 million equivalent). The EEC is providing a grant
to the Government of Morocco to support FDA's operations. The FDA is also supported by the Bank
under the ASIL 1 (Loan 3403-MOR) to promote improved farm technology. It is currently envisaged
(under an ASIL 2 and in cooperation with the EEC and the Moroccans) to reorganize the FDA to make
It an enhanced instrument for rural development (not only agriculture) and to better target its scarce
resources towards the rural poor.

FSDP Key Policy Areas
A. Kea Features of Finandal Sector Poliies and Reforms
1.          Indirect Control of Credit and Money. The financial sector reform program
supported by the Bank (FSDP) includes the elimination of all credit ceilings, to promote competition
in the banking system, and the strengthening of the Central Bank's indirect control instruments. The
following three sets of measures will be used to reinforce the indirect monetary control: (a) the
Central Bank's monetary control capacity will be enhanced through a more effective use of reserve
requirements. Specifically, in addition to sight deposits, it will have the authority to extend the base
to include time deposits. Furthermore, the ceilings on the reserve will be raised from 15% to 25%
on sight deposits , and they will be set at 10% on time deposits; (b) the control of the monetary base
through banks' refinancing at the Central Bank will be enhanced by limiting the eligibility to fixed
rate rediscounting on direct medium-term investment loans to small scale enterprises; and (c) a single,
seven-day interest rate will be applied on all advances at variable rate.
2.           Development of Domestic Financial Marke"t. The reforms under the FSDP aim at
encouraging the development of an efficient market for government securities which is the first
critical step towards the development of domestic financial markets. Until recently, banks had been
required to invest 35% of sight deposits in Treasury bills at 4.259% per year, thus constraining the
development of a market for govermnent securities. Under the reform programs, these mandatory
placements are being gradually reduced and replaced by funding through the auction market. As a
initial step, the ratio of sight deposits to be placed in T-bills was reduced to 32% in 1991 and was
further reduced to 25 % in 1993. Furthermore, the program includes appropriate measures in order to
expand the auction market to insurance companies and other enterprises; allow banks to underwrite
Treasury bond issues; and place long-term bonds through public offerings as opposed to the current
system of bilateral placements with institutional investors. The program also includes measures to
harmonize the tax treatment of all financial instruments on the basis of a study to be carried out by
the Ministry of Finance, as well as reform the Stock Exchange and to create mutual equity funds.
3.           Interest Rate Uberalization. The financial sector reform program includes: (a) the
liberalization of interest rates on bank deposits above three months; (b) the liberalization of all lending
rates, with the exception
of export financing and rediscountable medium-term investment loans to small scale industries which
would continue to have regulated rates at 8% and 12 % respectively; and the revision of the ceiling
on lending rates which will be



- 66 -
ANNEX 9A
Page 2 of 2
based on the cost of banks' resources. This ceiling was set at I and 1/3 times the weighted average
rate or six and twelve-month bank deposits and adjusted every six months. It was recently revised to
a maximum rate of 2.5% above the weighted average rate. Furthermore, emphasis will be given to
encouraging variable interest rates where applicable.
4.           Regulation and Suervision of the BankingSgstem. Various reforms had already
been introduced to strengthen the prudential regulatory framework and the supervision of banks,
including: (a) the modification, in 1986, of the 1967 Banking Law establishing the legal framework
for the banking system to include a uniform accounting system; (b) the setting up of a comprehensive
on-site examination system, although its full implementation remains hampered by understaffing; and
(c) the institution of prudential ratios requiring: maintenance of a solvency ratio of 5.25% of net
worth to sight and term deposits, minimum capital and net equity of 100 million DH; provisioning
against doubtful loans; and risk concentration limited to 10% of net equity to any single borrower.
'.           To preserve the stability of the banking system in the context of the liberalization of
the financial sector, the following additional measures have been taken:
(a)   the enactment in July 1993 of a new Banking Law which provides a more rigorous
framework for Central Bank supervision and regulation of the banking system;
0)    the requirements that external audits of banks fully follow International Auditing
Standards;
(c)   the adoption of capital adequacy standards in line with the 8% capital to risk-weighted
assets ratio of the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision, which all banks will have
to comply with by January 1994. CNCA has already adopted this minimum capital
adequacy standard in 1989 under Loan 3088-MOR;
(d)   the revision of prudential ratios and accounting standards so that loans to a single
beneficiary are limited to 7% of the net equity of the bank as of end 1993, and loans
to a single corporate group are limited to 15% of net equity as of end 1994;
(e)   the introduction of a new loan classification and provisioning system (Central Bank
circulars dated May 14, 1993) to be fully operational by January 1995 (January 1996
for CNCA); and
(f)   the harmonization of accounting policies and procedures as between banks and the
three major specialized financial institutions (CNCA, CIH and BNDE).

PERFORMANCE UNDER PREVIOUS AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECTS
A. First and Second Agricultural Credit Projects
(Loan 433-MOR: Loan 861-MOR and Credit 338-MQRI
1.           Under the First Project, a Bank loan US$10.0 million' helped finance CNCA's
lending program for the period 1966-69. It financed investments undertaken by about 6,000 medium
and large farmers and farm eouipment purchased by a State company (CGEA)2. The Project was
audited by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)' which attributed the Project's mixed results
to CNCA's shortage of qualified staff and to Government's interference in CNCA operations by
directing CNCA loans to small farmers, which was not envisaged under the Project. Under the
Second Project, the Bank provided a Loan/Credit of US$34.0 million to CNCA to finance medium
and large farmers' investments over the 1973-76 period. About 17,000, mostly large farmers,
benefitted from the project. Based on the experience of the First Project, the Bank's concern related
to CNCA's institutional problems including: (a) the need to introduce separate accounts for CLCA
operations; (1) the strengthening of CNCA capital structure; (c) the need to increase profitability of
CNCA's operations; and (d) the need to increase the reliability of financial data. According to the
Prject Performance Audit Report (PPAR) No. 2543 issued June 12, 1979, results were positive.
CLCA accounts were separated in 1972 and the increase in capital was made effective in 1973.
Following Bank insistence, interest rates on medium-term loans were increased to 7% for
cooperatives and 8.5% for CRCA clients. Auditing of CNCA's accounts was begun by independent
external auditors.

B. Third Agricultual Creit ProJect (Loan 1361-MOR)
2.           The Third Agricultural Credit Project, which became effective on August 11, 1977,
financed medium and large farmers, farmer pre-cooperative groups, and small farmers, the latter in
view of the good results obtained by CNCA. The Bank loan of US$35.0 million was disbursed on
schedule. According to PPAR No. 3248 dated December 23, 1980, the Project achieved its
objectives in terms of expansion of lending activity and farmer coverage, and of financing investment
having a positive impact on beneficiaries' income (high financial rates of return), employment
creation (about 52,000 man-years of employment were created) and the Moroccan economy (high
economic rates of return).
C. Fourth Agrcultural Credit PMiect (Lan 1704MOR)
3.           The Fourth Agricultural Credit Project included all CNCA lending to individual
farmers through Headquarters, CRCAs and CLCAs; to Agrarian Reform Cooperatives and Pre-
cooperative Associations; and to small- and medium-scale agro-industries. Also included was
technica assistance to assist CNCA in improving its monitoring and evaluation system. The Project
covered CNCA lending over the period September 1979 to August 1982. Total Project costs were
estimated at US$737.2 million equivalent, with the World Bank loan of US$70.0 million, a loan from
KfW of US$50.0 million equivalent and a loan from the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD) of about US$25.0 million equivalent financing 58% of the project's estimated
fbreign exchange cost (US$250.0 million). The loan was fully disbursed by August 25, 1983. The
OED report No. 5392 of December 28, 1984 described it as a successful operation on account of: (a)
substantial increase in the number and amount of lending to small farmers, though maintaining
satisfactory credit recovery rates; and (b) a satisfactory financial performance of CNCA.
D. Wft and Sixth Ag&ricultrl Credit Projects
(Loan 2367-MOR and 2731-MOR)
4.           The Fifth Agricultural Credit Project gave emphasis to the components of the Fourth
Project, namely: (a) agro-industrial development through the establishment of a special agro-
industrial lending unit at one CRCA (Meknes); (b) institution building through financing the design of
a management information system (MIS); and (c) domestic resource mobilization by encouraging
banking activities in branch offices. Under this project, CNCA maintained the strict financial
standards required under the Loan Agreement and emerged as an expanding financial institution
making a major contribution to sectoral development. The Project covered CNCA lending from
September 1983 to August 1986 and was fully disbursed and closed on March 17, 1987, several
months ahead of schedule despite the adverse impact of two major droughts (1984-85) on agricultural
production which led to farm credit rescheduling. The foreign exchange cost was cofinanced by
FADES (US$26.0 milllion), ADB (US$31.0 million), KfW (US$24.0 million) and the Bank loan of
US$115.4 million equivalent.

5.           The Sixth Agricultural Credit Project (US$120 million) pursued the institutional
building objectives started during the Fifth Project. It wps also designed to be consistent with sectoral
objectives supported by the Bank through ASAL operations, with increased attention to training.
The Loan (US$120 million) was fully disbutsed and closed on March 31, 1990 as scheduled.
Cofinancing was provided by ADB (US$66.0 million) and KfW (US$35.0 million). USAID was
involved in the technical assistance, sector studies and training components.
6.           The two projects had considerable positive impact on CNCA's development as a
viable farm credit institution and on its emerging ability to compete in the overall financial
environment in which it operates. Furthermore, the projects have been particularly successful in
channeling resources to agriculture and financing private investments in the sector and in agro-
industry, increasing production, improving food security, and upgrading agricultural technology and
productivity. A combined Project Completion Report No. 11492 of December 30, 1992 for both
projects and OED's Project Performance Audit Report No. 11491 released on January 22, 1993 rated
both projects as satisfactory, with probable sustainability, and substantial institutional development
impact.
E. National AgrculurAl Credit Proiect (Loan 3O88-MOR-
7.           Consistent with the Government's adjustment program supported by the Bank, the
innovative National Agricultural Credit Project supported the long-term goal of CNCA's conversion
to a full service bank with increased managerial and financial autonomy, and its renewed efforts to
adapt its organization and procedures to be responsive to accelerated investments by the private sector
in the rural areas of Morocco. Total project cost is US$1,532.0 million, with financing from the
Bank (US$190.0 million), KfW (US$38.0 million), ADB ($US70.0 million), EIB (US$60.0 million),
and FADES (US$30.0 million). Over a four-year implementation period (1989-93), the project
funded: (a) medium-and long-term credit to farmers, cooperatives, fishermen, artisans (men and
women), agro-industries, rural housing and rural enterprises; and (b) CNCA's institutional capacity to
develop competitive banking and saving activities (branch network refurbishing and development,
office technology equipment and software, training programs, and consultant services).
8.           The project performance has been good. The Loan was 99.5% disbursed at the end
of June 1993 (100% of appraisal estimates). CNCA's overall financial results for 1988-1992 were,
overall, satisfactory with a downtrend in 1992 as the result of droughts. Priority actions now include
the need for CNCA to improve its planning capacity and to fully computerize its activities (technical
assistance on modern management control started in mid-March 1992). Improved management and
training will help CNCA compete better with other banks nationwide on profitable activities and on
domestic resources mobilization. One issue in agriculture is the adverse impact of the 1992 and 1993
droughts on CNCA's rural savings mobilization and credit recoveries. An

Page 4 of 4
action plan is being implenentad to redress the situation. Increased attention is given to drought
management and to the need to give priority to the setting up of a sound crop insurance system and
drought relief fund to secure the banking system. This has been initiated under Loan 3088-MOR and
will be implemented on a pilot basis under the fbllow-up National Rural Finance Project.
9.           ne follow-up project, building on the lessons of experience from previous operations,
has been designed to consolidate the sustainable foundations of a high quality, univa and
competitive Credit Agricole Bank within a gradually liberalized financial sector s gically linked to
the FSDP and financial sector reforms in Morocco. In the evaluation summary of its recent
performance audit report No. 11491, OED highlighted that "the Bank provided valuable assistance in
its supervision missions by encouraging appropriate reforms at CNCA'. OED also suggested that
"the broadening of rural financial markets needs to be explored", and concluded that 'continmed
support for CNCA should be assured".

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
CNCA's Policy Statement
PREAMBLE
Agriculture has always been a key sector of the Morocan economy and as such, has
always been accorded priority in national development plans.
Agriculture occupies some 8 million hectares. It currently contributes about 18% of GDP
and 31% of exports, employs 40% of the active population, and numbers more than 2 million rural farm
fatnilies.
The drought period of 1980-84 seriously undermined Morocco's agricultural base. Since
1985, however, agriculture has staged a recovery with record production levels, particularly of grains,
in 1985/86 and 1987/88, thanks to good climatic conditions.1'
Food security and rural development are among the major goals of the 1988-92
Orientation Plan (Plan d'OrientaIIon).Y As the major bank for financing of the rural sector, CNCA is
destined to play a decisive role in their achievement.
Since it was established in 1961, CNCA has developed steadily, in response to the
farmers' growing financing needs, through expansion of its network, continuous review of its loan
systems and augmentation of its resources.
It must be stressed, however, that despite CNCA's important contribution to the financing
of agriculture, its operations continue to be inadequate in light of the capital requirements for private
investment in the agriculture and rural sector.
Thus, in conformity with the High Directives of His Majesty the King, CNCA, while
remaining firmly committed to its function of a development bank, needs to convert to a universal bank.
It    Morocco experienced new severe droughts in 1991-92 and 1992-93.
IV    These priorities also stand for 1993-97.

the monetary authorities, shall set its interest rates so that they produce adequate net income to:
-     cover the whole of its operating expenses and debt charges;
-     create depreciation reserves and provisions against doubtful debts, exchange
risks borne by it, and depreciation of participations;
-     generate adequate net income to remunerate its equity funds.
14.          In order to avoid hampering the resumption of investment among debtor small-scale
farmers, CNCA will perform a case-by-case analysis of its credit portfolio, set up adequate provisions
to cover the true delinquency risks, and submit a rehabilitation plan to help farmers indebted to the
Government.

15.         CNCA shall set up a "National Guarantee Fund" to cover farmers against the risk of
delinquency in the event of natural disaster.
16.         CNCA shall have its annual accounts audited by external auditors in accordance with
international standards applied in bank auditing.
Title Vl
MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM PLAN
17.         CNCA shall set up a medium- and long-term planning system with annual goals for
development of its activities of lending, receipt of deposits, savings and other resources, and loan
repayments and for expansion of its network.
18.         Each year, on the basis of its medium- and long-term plan, CNCA shall prepare a
budget and submit it to the Board of Directors for approval. The budget shall set forth the goals to
be achieved, in light of the prevailing economic situation, the financial, physical, and human
resources to be deployed to ensure its success, and the expected performance criteria.
19.         CNCA shall give priority to revitalizing, restructuring, expanding and modernizing its
network.
20.          CNCA shall progressively develop a management control and internal check system as
the basis for these planning and network revitalization activities.
Title VI
ENANCLAL CONTROL
21.          The development of CNCA into a universal bank implies relaxation of financial
control by the Government. CNCA shall therefore set up, in collaboration with the Ministry of
Finance, a system of a posteriori control to be applied, as in the other financial institutions, by a
government commissioner.
Title VIII
WORK ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL POLICY
22.          CNCA shall follow a sound policy with respect to work organization and distribution
and shall define tasks and responsibilities at the cental and regional levels.

ANNEX I I
Page 6 of 6
23.          CNCA shall take steps to simplify the procedures for loan approval and management
of banking services, by developing, decentralizing, and modernizing its data processing facilities.
24.          To enable it to perform its new functions as a universal bank, CNCA shall set up a
program of basic and refresher training for the whole of its staff.
25.          Personnel policy shall be set forth in regulations approved by the pertinent financial
control agency. These regulations shall provide personnel with the same remuneration and career
deveopment conditions as are applied by financial institutions similar to CNCA.
26.          In order to foster a spirit of solidarity among its personnel, CNCA shall set up a
"Social Fund" (Fonds des Oeuwes Sodales) to assist staff in post or retirees and to promote all
social-type activities of benefit to the staff.

CNCA's tratc  Plamin  and Management Control
1.           Pm  pos In order for CNCA to develop a fairly detailed, strategic plan and a set of
action plans to carry out its strategy as well as a tracking and review mechanism, CNCA established a
Planning Unit reporting to CNCA's Chief Executive Office (CEO). The Unit needs to be internally
organized to be fully operational by the end of 1993.
2.           Objecives of the Planni   Unit. The Planning Unit will be responsible for
elaborating CNCA corporate objectives, in conjunction with the CEO, and communicating them down
to the lowest management level within the institution. The Planning Unit will also manage the
planning and budgeting process, establish schedules, ensure the necessary coordination between
departments, organize and provide materials for planning conferences, and conduct reviews.
3.           Mehods. A sound budgeting and planning process requires a short, carefully worded
statement of institutional purpose covering markets and strategic goals that acts as a framework for
the entire management process. CNCA's development objectives and strategy are described in para.
4.36 of the main report. The planning process also states the institution's approach to planning,
fiequency of plan, areas covered, and review/control process. To make the process successful,
taining is essential. CNCA's plan will cover the following functional areas:
(a)    Risk Asset Mganagement: Sectors targeted for lending, portfolio
improvement, debt recovery, new loan products;
(b)    Liability Management: Deposit generation, new liability products, marketing;
(c)    Fee Inoome Managemen: Sources of increased fee income and means of marketing
and delivering fee-based services;
(d)    Personnel Management: Training, career development programs, recruitment,
rotation, promotion, compensation;
(e)    ProductivityEfficiency Enhancement: Automation, manual of procedures, revised
documentation; and

(f)    Control EFu.nIdn: Internal audit, external audit, loan review, performance targets.
The structure of the planning process can be visualized as follows:
(a)   Input and analysis phase: scanning the environment, defining corporate mission and
objectives, preparing economic and financial projections;
(b)    Decision phase: setting division objectives and strategy development;
(c)    Documentation phase: preparing strategic position papers, action plans and budgets;
(d)    Review phase: reviewing plan documents, strategy, action plans, budget, reporting
requirements and control mechanisms.
4.           PWonm           Bevie. Analysis of progress in reaching earnings objectives and
implementing action plans should take place monthly. Quarterly review will give emphasis on the
analysis of acal results against plan. Reviews should take place at all levels of the organization1, and
concentrate mainly on expectation to plan and on the development of corrective action programs for
CNCA.
5.           Suk. Pklh _ agndI?peratklnalklanning. CNCA has already established broad
corporate objectives for the sectors to which it lends and intends to lend, for the enhancement of
deposit generating capacity and for the diversification of financial products and services. This means
that CNCA has already a strong sense of direction. Also, this sense of direction has been
communicated to CNCA's branch managers. CNCA has developed an Orientation Plan which spells
out the major orientation of the institution for 1993-96. What is needed at this time (end 1993) is a
eoncerted effort to set a detailed timeframe for the accomplishment of the annual planning cycle
(Business Plan). At this transition period, planning at CNCA should therefore have a practical,
implementation-oriented style.

KIUNGDOM OF MOROCCO
NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
Climatic Risk Management and Agricultural Insurance Fund
A. Objciv
1.           An agricultural risk management mechanism is proposed to provide protection to farmers
from climatic risks. This mechanism would reduce the climatic risk in lending and encourage greater
participation in rural lending among banking institutions. The proposal contains the institutional
arrangements, technical parameters, and financial requirements of the program. This should serve as a
good basis for Government to decide whether or not to implement a risk management scheme. Details
are in Working Document No. 3B.
B. InstitutionalArangement
2.           Under this option, the conceptual framework calls for the private insurance sector to
administer the insurance program with support from the Government. Insurance cover for risks which
are commercially nsurable would be offered by private insurance companies on their own account while
drought insurance would be offered by the Government but implementation would be carried out by the
private insurance sector. If this option is retained, the establishment of a Consortium of private
commercial insurers, a Technical Support Unit and an Insurance Fund for Agricultural Risk are proposed.
Insuranensnm
3.           An Insurance Consortium is proposed to be established in the private sector. This
Consortium will consist of participating companies who would be contractually responsible to the
Government for the implementation of the proposed agricultural insurance program. Companies would
mainin their financial irdependence and bear the risk for their own products, but would comply with
common terms and conditions. This arrangement differs from the pool concept which has failed in other
insurance lines such as in automobile insurance. There would be a lead insurance company. The lead
insurer would be the company with the longest experience and the largest share in the agricultural
insurance market. It should have adequate technical capability and an institutional network.
4.           The Consortium would have a legal personality. The members of the Consortium would
constitute a Governing Board to be chared by the lead insurer. Its operation would be governed
according to a set of by-laws which would describe its scope of operation and the requirements and
responsibilities of membership. Agreements reached by the Consortium would be binding on each
member insurance company.



- 86-
ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 5
Technical Support Unit
5.           Under this proposed option, a Technical Support Unit (TSU) would be established by the
Consortium. The TSU would assist participating companies develop new products, carry out actuarial
studies, establish and manage underwriting and loss adjustment, study the agricultural insurance market,
prepare annual insurance plans, perform annual reviews of coverage and provide technical
recommendations to the Consortium.
6.          Insurance products which are supported by a Government's subsidy would use a common
loss assessment service. It would be the major responsibility of the TSU to manage the loss adjustment
activity. It could perform this function by establishing its own network of loss assessors or, subject to
the approval of the Consortium, enter into contract with the lead insurer to perform this function under
pre-agreed guidelines.
7.           The TSU would be responsible for preparing for the Consortium an Annual Insurance
Plan which would be submitted to the Government (e.g. represented by the Ministry of Finance). This
plan would contain the proposed coverage, the level of premium subsidy, estimated income, financial
requirements and other features of the plan. Agreement to the annual plan would be precondition to the
implementation of the insurance program.
8.          It would have a small but highly qualified staff who are knowledgeable on agricultural
insurance. The TSU would initially need to be provided assistance to develop the necessary management
and staff capability. Staff would be provided local and foreign training. A twinning arrangement with
a foreign agricultural insurance organization would be a possibility. The TSU would be financed by a
part of the insurance premium, the level to be decided by the Consortium. The budget for the TSU
would be based on the overhead cost and the cost of loss adjustment. It would be hosted by the lead
insurer.
Agricultural Insurance Fund
9.           An Agricultural Insurance Fund (Fond d'Assurance Agricole contre les Calamites
Naturelles - FAA) would be established by the Government. It would be the responsibility of the
Government to provide initial capitalization of the Fund and recurrent costs from possible sources of
funds such as annual budgetary appropriations, surcharge on insurance premium, import taxes, profits
from wheat imports, land tax, grants, or other sources. After a while, the Insurance Fund should be able
to generate enough revenues to cover its cost, in particular during non-drought years. It would be
administered by a Management Committee (Comite de Gestion) which could be composed of the
following: Representatives of the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture, the lead insurer, the
Federation of Insurance (Federation Marocaine des Societies d'Assurances et de Reassurances), the State-
owned 'SocietE Centrale de Reassurance", CNCA, commercial banks and farmers. The Government
would decide on the final composition of the Management Committee. A Director would be appointed
to supervise day-to-day activities.
C. Insurance Products
10.         Insurance products are categorized under three main groups of which the Agricultural
Insurance Fund would support two types:



- 87 -
ANNEX 13
Page 3 of S
(a)    Existing Products. These are products currently being offered by insurance
companh s in Morocco. These are primarily farmers' insurance for vehicles,
workmen's compensation, fire, personal accident and third party liability. The
coverage for agricultural production is very limited, mainly hail and fire
insurance. These products would not need any Government support.
(b)   Potentially Commercial Products. These are new products which would have the
potential of beirg commercially viable. These may not be viable in the beginning
because of the lack of experience and inadequate market penetration. It is
expected that these new products would be commercially viable over time. These
products would need some Government support during the development stage.
(c)    Non-Commercial Products. This type of insurance would cover risk which
cannot become commercially viable because the frequency and extent of losses
would make premium rates exceedingly high and unaffordable for farmers. The
risk would be too great for private insurance companies to assume although some
risk assumption could become possible in the medium-term. The most notable
risk to be covered by this type of insurance is drought. This product would need
continuing Government subsidy but may be reduced over time.
11.         Commercially Viable Products. Products would be developed and sold by individual
insurers following underwriting guidelines of the Consortium. To encourage the development of these
products, it is proposed that the Government subsidize a proportion of the premium on a de-escalating
scale for a period of five years. For example, the subsidy would be 50% in the first year and declining
to 10% in the fifth year. Individual companies would retain full risk and would negotiate private sector
reinsurance, thereby attracting expertise of international reinsurers and avoiding risk assumption of these
products by the Government.
Non-Commercial Products
12.         Drought insurance would be sold for and in the name of the Agricultural Insurance Fund.
Participating companies would retain a part of the premium but would not retain any risk. Drought
insurance would be sold as additional cover to a basic coverage under an existing crop insurance product
or new commercially viable product to ensure that sound underwriting practices are maintained. A
special type of basic coverage targeted to the cereal sector would also be developed. Coverage would
be made available to all farmers nationwide. It should be made mandatory for borrowers of CNCA to
take out a drought insurancepolicy and would be useful to other commercial banks. It would be optional
for those who voluntarily insure.



- 88 -
ANNEX 13
Page 4 of 5
13.          As experience is gained in drought insurance, a review would be carried out to determine
whether private insurance companies could assume a part of the risk. The feasibility of developing a risk
sharing and/or stop loss arrangement whereby private insurance companies would be the primary insurer
would be explored.
D. Technical Parameters
14.          Drought Insurance, Drought insurance would initially be limited to cereal production this
being the major crop at risk. Of the total area of agricultural land of 8,944,100 hectares (including fallow
of 1,906,800 hectares), 5,490,800 hectares or 59 % is grown to cereals. Of the total cereal area,
4,243,000 hectares or 77% are predominantly rainfed. Some of these creas are the most sensitive to
drought. By limiting the average yearly losses as a percentage of the sum insured (loss rate) to 15% in
any given area, as much as 82% of the total cereal area grown under rainfed conditions or 3,485,000
hectares could be covered by drought insurance. Other areas which have losses beyond an average of
15% would be excluded.
15.          The average yearly loss rate for areas which are insurable is estimated to be 7.35% of
the total sum insured, assuming insured yields of 40 to 70% of average yields with larger deductibles
being applied to more risky areas. By providing a 15% loading to allow for additional losses when
provincially calculated losses are further subdivided into smaller ecological regions and adding a 10%
margin for cost of selling and contingencies, the average gross premium rate is calculated to be 9.2% of
the sum insured. This would vary from as low as 2.3 % to as high as 18.0% depending on the area.
With a proposed 50% premium subsidy from Governmnent, premium rates charged farmers would range
from as low as 1.2% to as high as 9.0%. Loss assessment would be performed on an areawide basis.
16.          Commercially Viable Products. The proposal for commercially viable products is to offer
coverage for risks which are commercially insurable. The basic policy for commercially insurable risk
would cover hail and fire. Additional perils which can be covered are frost, flood, excess rain and wind.
The likely crops are fruit trees, vines, vegetables, greenhouse crops, industrial crops and specialty crops.
Consortium members would be encouraged to develop policies for each crop type and region. Coverage
would be based on the cost of production. Premium rates would range from 2.5% to 7.5% for the basic
cover and from 3.5% to 10.0% for both basic and additional cover.
E. Financial Requirements
15.          DroughtInsur . The sum insured is estimated to be DH 150 per quintal or DH 600-
1,800 per hectare depending on the level of insured yield. The major factor which would determine the
cost of the program to the Government is
the level of uptake of drought insurance. Assuming a 50% premium subsidy and a 30% coverage of the
insurable area, the annual cost to the Government would be DH 45 million ($5 million). At 70%
coverage, the cost increases to DH 105 million (US$ 11.7 million). The cost to the Government would
average DH 43 (US$ 4.78) per hectare, a reasonable level compared to the higher costs in other
countries.

ANNEX 13
Page 5 of 5
18.          The problem arises in meeting the capital requirements of the Insurance Fund. Insurance
schemes normally would spread risk over time and space. Since drought usually occurs as a national
catastrophe (every five years in average in Morocco), there is very little opportunity to spread the risk
over space. The drought insurance scheme is limited to spreading the risk over time. In a severe drought
year, potential losses would range from DH 418 million (US$ 46 million) with a 30% coverage to as
much as DH 975 million (U1S$ 108 million) with a coverage of 70%. If it happens that there are two
consecutive drought years as has happened during the past two years (1991-92) and 1992-93), the losses
would be staggering. The problem arises with the onset of drought during the early years of the
program. The Insurance Fund should have available as much to absorb losses for two consecutive
drought years to cover this eventuality. The capital requirements of the Fund can be reduced by (a)
reducing initial coverage to farmers being financed; (b) obtaining international reinsurance; and (c)
arranging for a contingent loans agreement.
19.          Commercially Viable Products. To encourage the private sector to develop these
products, premium would be subsidized on a declining scale so that by the sixth year of the policy there
would no longer be any subsidy. Depending on the crop, the sum insured would range from DH 3,635
for irrigated cereals to DH 115,379 fo.  iato productioh. Using 30% of the rainfed cereal area as the
basis for estimating cost to the Government, the cost for the first year is estimated to be DH 17 million
(US$ 1.9 million) and reduced to zero on the sixth year or a total of DH 29 million (US$ 3.2 million)
over a five year period on the assumption that there would be no additional new products developed.
20.          Administrative Costs. The annual administrative cost of operating the Insurance Fund
is DH 1.3 million (IIS$ 145,000) or 3.0% of the amount of the fund while the Technical Service Unit
would cost DH 3.4 million (US$ 375,000) or an equivalent of 3.8% of the total premium during the
first year of the program. These rates would decline as volumes increase during subsequent years.
F. Benefits of the Program
21.          Potential social and economic benefits on the program include (a) farmer income
stabilization in adverse years; (b) increased rural welfare and reduced urban migration; (c) reduced
requirement for ad-hoc disaster relief; (d) formalized and contractual distribution of indemnity based
on objective measurement of loss severity; and (e) encouragement of farmers to invest in improved
crop production technology. Potential benefits to operation of the agricultural credit system for
CNCA and other banks include (a) partial or full repayment of short-term loans in the event of crop
shortfall or damage; (b) improved financial stability of farmers leading to ability to service medium-
and long-term loans; (c) opportunity for increased credit discipline by separation of causes of loan
failure by climatic or other reasons. Potential benefits to the Government include the regular and
known annual budgetary allocation to an insurance Fund and reduced requirements for disaster relief
financing.
22.          Brief terms of reference for the creation of the Agricultural Insurance Fund are in
attchment I of this annex.



- 90 -
ANNEX 13
Attachment I
Terms of Reference for the Creation in Morocco of an
Agiculitural Insurance Fund for Natural Calamities
1.    Purose. The Government of Morxco envisage the creation of an Agricultural Insurance Fund
that will insure climatic risk and, in particular, cover part of the principal of unpaid subloans granted at
CNCA's risk to small and medium operators in rainfed areas. The Fund will intervene only in cases
where it is clear that natural calamities are a dominant factor in the formation of existing arrears. The
Fund will be open to all farmers, and to all banks in case they wish to finance rainfed agriculture.
2.    Justification. Credit guarantees for climatic risk will encourage rural banks to provide crediL to
small farmers , and reduce the risk to the rural banking sector to lend to target groups living in
disadvantaged economic areas. Loan repayment guarantees can also foster the formation of private
mutual guarantee associations by target group beneficiaries.
3.    Methods. Government will establish the Fund in cooperation with the insurance sector, and with
CNCA's assistance. Based on the conclusions and recommendations of the technical study on
Agricultural Risk Management and Insurance Fund (May 1993), this will include:
(a)    a clear definition of the objectives of the Fund;
(b)    proposals for organizing, financing and managing the Fund;
(c)    analysis of the risks that are eligible for coverage by the Fund and of the operational
procedures to provide effective and efficient risk coverage to the beneficiaries;
(d)   legal aspects and preparation of the by-law under which the Fund will be established and
will operate, establishment of the Management Committee and nomination of the Director
who will supervise day-to-day activities.
4.    Conditions for Success. Despite the advantages of such insurance funds, too much should not
be expected from them. They alone cannot solve the problem of improved access to credit for small
farmers. Loan default in case of natural calamities should also be as3ociated with a careful analysis on
a case-by-case basis of the eligibility to the Fund. The risk of bureaucratization of an Insurance Furd
for drought management can be minimized if the target beneficiaries can participate actively in the
guarantee process. Beneficiaries will have to pay a compulsory premium to be eligible. The Insurance
Sector will insure insurable risks, and other climatic risks up to a certain limit (stop loss provision) from
which the Fund will step in. The scheme will not repay income losses of farmers, but only part of the
crop production cost involved, and therefore related loan dues.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
CNCA's On-lending Appraisal Methods
1.            Appraisal of Subloans to Farmers Fishermen. Rural Women. Artisans and Other
Rural Ouirators. The objective of the appraisal is to demonstrate that: (a) the proposed investments
are sound on technical, environmental and economic grounds, and are financially viable based on the
subproject's financial plan and cash flow analysis; and (b) the subloan applicants are creditworthy, and
will be able to repay their loans. As calculations of financial rates of return (FRRs) for all subloans are
impractical, CNCA calculates an FRR for typical subprojects in each principal activity financed. For
small-farm loans, separate feasibility studies are replaced by standardized loan packages for various
categories of investment to speed up approval decisions and disbursement. Regarding small farmers and
rural women, improved methods have been tested under the previous Bank-financed agricultural credit
project (Ln. 3088-MOR). CNCA has introduced nationwide these improved methods of subloan appraisal
for investment lending to small farmers, and is also using appropriate methods for subloans to fishermen,
artisans and other rural operators. Details are in working document no. 7.
2.            Apprasal of Subloans to Agro-Industrial Investors.  For these projects, CNCA
conducts environmental impact assessments and it uses the following additional financial measurements
case-by-case to cross-check internal rate of return IRR) and net return on equity (ROI) calculations',
and working capital requirements:
(a)    current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of at least 1.3, as computed from the
basic financial statements of the last five years;
(b)    long-term debt to equity ratio, after the proposed loan has been made, preferably not over
2 to 1; and
(c)    ratio of cash flow after taxes to long-term debt service of at least 1.3, as estimated from
projected cash flow statements on five years. Cash flow should include net profit after
taxes, depreciation, and annual financial charges on long-term debt; long-term debt
service includes principal and interest.
Regarding investments for newly created enterprises the ratio analysis will be done on the basis of
projected financial statements only.
I/     On IRR and ROI a hurdle rate (cut-off rate) will be introduced for accepting or rejecting investment
proposals. CNCA normally requires that IRR should be about 12X to make a limited risk "accept"
decision, but it does not automatically reject a proposed investment with a 10X IRR if additional
measurements shou that the investment is sound.

3.            Ig for Rurut 1ffii    . CNCA stafted lending for rural housing, on a pilot basis,
in 1984 with uneven success because of extremely tight terms and conditions for subloans and lengthy
application procedures. In December 1987, CNCA revised its credit guidelines for rutal housing on the
basis of the findings of a market study on rural housing carried out with the participation of a
representative sample of 1,890 rural families in four provinces. In 1988, CNCA started to expand credit
in that secor and to target it more precisely based on the results of the study. Actual lending for rural
housing increased from DH 40 million (US$5 million) in 1988 to DH 140 million (US$17 million) in
1989 and to DH 172 million (US$21 million) in 1992. Borrowers for construction loans for low-cost new
houses receive a 4% or 5% social housing rebate from Government on the current 14% or 12% interest
rate ch&rged by CNCA (para. 4.20, Table 4.1 of main report), resulting in a net interest rate that is
amply positive in real terms.
4.           Disbursemnt and Sunsion  of Sublom.   CNCA  would require selected
sub-borrowers to use project funds for approved purposes. This would be achieved through direct
payments to suppliers, and quarterly or semi-annual visits to subprojects by CNCA's field staff as may
be prescribed by CNCA's headquarters. Follow-up reports on each visit would comment briefly on
utilization of subloan funds, compare actual and planned operations, review clients' management and
financial problems, assess environmental impact where applicable, and make recommendations. CNCA's
headquarters staff would also make selective field visits to problem operations nationwide to assess their
problems and develop solutions.

A. Supervision Strategy
1.           Effective project implementation will be the key to the development impact of CNCA
in Morocco. Bank supervision strategy and plans will pay special attention to the institutional
development objectives of the project, and monitor closely the status of legal covenants and

2.           Heavy start-up supervision will be needed to ease the transition between Loan 3088-
MOR and the new loan, to keep institutional reforms on track, and to monitor progress on
cofinancing, on the diversification by CNCA of its loan portfolio (agro-industries, rural housing,
fisheries, rural women activities), branch network development with an improved assets/liabilities

/t      CNCA believes that this calculation should be tailored more specifically to the case of CNCA and
therefore reserves its judgement on the figures presented (OED, PPAR, Decemter 30, 1992).
/2      Two important reasons for the relative downtrend in profitability, as measured by the Return on
Equity are that: a) CNCA has continued to augment its provisions for bad debts. These have risen
from 39.31 to 42.51 of the total volume in arrears over the past year; b) Since January, 1992, CNCA
has adopted a more prudent approach for the inclusion of accrued interest income on non-performing
loans in its income statement.
For details on economic theory and methodology, see World Bank Discussion Paper No. 174 by Mr. Jacob
Yaron.

A       The Market Reference Rate used is the interest rate on six-month Treasury Bills as a base rate for
short term funds and the numerical average of the one-year and five-year Treasury Bill rates as a
base rate for long term funds. The short and long term base rates are weighted by the proportion of
CNCA's risk assets that are short or long term. One percentage point is added as the administrative
cost associated with mobilizing these deposits. (The 1991 Financial Sector Developnent Project adds
a mark-up of 0.75% over the cost of funds.) The mark-up can also be thought of as representing the
premium that an investor would expect over and above the Treasury Bill rate to invest in CNCA.
Given the type of lending that CNCA engages in (agriculture) a 1/ mark-up may represent too small a
risk premium.
The table below gives an estimation of the "market reference rate" that CNCA woutd have to pay if
access to other available funds were removed overnight:
1989     1990      1991     1992
INTEREST RATE ON 6-MONTH T-BILLS:            9.5%     9.5%      S.5%    10.5%
WEIGHT: SHORT TERM / TOTAL RISK ASSETS:   31.1%    32.6%    35.2%    35.3%
INTEREST RATE ON 1-YEAR T-BILLS:            11.0%    40.5%    11.0%    11.0%
INTEREST RATE ON 5-YEAR T-BILLS:            12.5%    13.0%    13.0%    13.0%
NUMERICAL AVERAGE OF THESE 2 RATES:         11.8%    11.8%    12.0%    12.0%
WEIGHT: LONG TERM I TOTAL RISK ASSETS:    68.9%    67.4%    64.8%    64.7%
WEIGHTED COST OF FUNDS:                     11.0%    t1.0%    11.1%    11.5%
ADDITIONAL COST OF MO81LISING RESOURCES:   1.0%       1.0%      1.0%     1.0%
MARKET REFERENCE RATE:                      12.0%    12.0X    12.1%    12.5%
/'      Include one-year "Solidarity bonds" and all of CNCA's long-term sources of funds: IBRD loans, other
external loans and domestic loans.
/e      The subsidy is calculated as the difference between the market reference rate and the average
interest rate (6%) paid on "concessional" funds, times the average annual volume of concessional
funds, i.e. as tA-B]xC. (Despite for borrowings, the average cost of resources (in financial terms)
at CNCA is actually at the same level as other banks, i.e 6%). As CNCA takes on the full foreign
exchange risk on concessional borrowings, the valuation of this subsidy becomes difficult (as it is
dependent on the valuation of the risk associated with foreign borrowings).
/7      The subsidy represents the opportunity cost of capital.
/'      In this calculation, two important adjustments are made to CNCA's pre-tax profit.  The first is an
upward adjustment to pre-tax profit by the amount of CNCA's foreign exchange risk contribution to
avoid double-counting by augmenting CNCA's profits by the amount of CNCA's foreign exchange risk
provision. A second adjustment is made to reflect that profits may be overstated (understated) if
provisions are underestimated (excessive).  Pre-tax profits were then adjusted by the difference
between actual and "adequate" provisions (see below).  Since 1990 this has had the effect of
augmenting profits.
Adequacy of CNCA's Provisions (for credit risk)
1988     198V      1990     1991     1992
OUTSTANDING END-OF-YEAR ARREARS:       2,041.0  2,538.0  2 823.0  3,333.4  3 673.0
CUMULATIVE BAD DEBT PROVISIONS:          640.3    872.6  1,082.4  1,309.9  1,562.2
"ADEQUATE" PROVISIONS, BASED ON LEVEL
APPROVED BY CNCA AUDITORS IN 1990:       714.4    888.3    988.1  1,166.7  1,285.6
SHORTFALL OR EXCESS:                     (74.0)   (15.7)    94.4    143.2    276.7
In the tight of two consecutive years of drought and of CNCA's drought-related arrears, it is
difficult to assess the adequacy of provisions to also cover climatic risks.
s'     Total subsidy minus adjusted profits.  As the figures are in millions of current Dirham, the real
growth in CNCA's subsidies is somewhat smaller.
/10     This is the ratio of the net subsidy to interest income.  It reveals the increase in interest income
that would, ceteris   ribus, obviate the need for subsidies for CNCA if all implicit and explicit
subsidies were eliminatea overnight.
/I      One reason this average rate has declined is that after January 01, 1992, CNCA stopped recording
interest over 26 months in arrears in the income statement, according to CNCA's audited financial
statements for 1992 (Note 2.2). There are clearly limits to the accuracy that can be achieved in
calculating the SDI on the basis of available information and assumptions made.
