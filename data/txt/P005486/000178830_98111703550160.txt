PREFACE
This is the combined Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the National Agricultural
Credit Project (Loan 3088-MOR) and the National Rural Finance Project (Loan 3662-MOR), made to the
Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) and guaranteed by the Kingdom of Morocco. Loan 3088-
MOR, in the amount of US$190 million equivalent, was approved on June 14, 1989, and made effective
on September 27, 1989. Loan 3662-MOR, in the amount of US$100 million equivalent, was approved on
November 23, 1993, and made effective on February 18, 1994.
Loan 3088-MOR was closed on December 31, 1993, as planned. It was fully disbursed, and the
last disbursement took place on March 28, 1994. - The African Development Bank (ADB) and the
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of the Federal Republic of Germany provided cofinancing for this
project. Loan 3662-MOR was closed on March 31, 1998, as planned. The last disbursement took place
on March 1, 1996, and US$79 million equivalent was cancelled out of the original US$100 million
equivalent. Cofinancing for this project was provided by the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
(OECF) of Japan, the Caisse Francaise de Developpement (CFD), the Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development (FADES), the European Investment Bank (EIB), and KfW.
The ICR was prepared by Ivan Christin (Consultant), under the supervision of Stephanie Gober
(ICR Project Manager, MNSPF). Task Team Leaders were Victor Agius and Axel Peuker (MNSPF), and
Nemat Shafik was the MNSPF Director.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's supervision mission March 30-April 3,
1998. The ICR is based on material in the project file. The borrower contributed to preparation of the
ICR by providing: 1) the data contained in Tables 8A and 8B; 2) comments on the draft version of the
report which have been incorporated into the text; and 3) its own report on Loan 3662-MOR, which is
attached as Appendix B.

EVALUATION SuMMARY
Introduction
i.    For almost 25 years, the Bank supported Morocco's Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA)
through a series of loans which, by 1988, totaled US$384.4 million. Over this time, the Bank and CNCA
had developed a high level of mutual confidence; in fact the Bank cited CNCA as the most prominent
example of a success story among many failures-in agricultural finance in the developing world. Through
the two loans under review, the Bank intended to develop a two-fold strategy. First, it sought to enhance
the economic performance of the agricultural sector. Agriculture was, and still is, a strategic sector in
Morocco's economy. By the end of the 1980s agriculture accounted for about 40% of employment and
was the primary source of foreign exchange earnings (about 33% of total exports). It is, however, subject
to the consequences of recurrent droughts, a cyclical phenomenon with about one drought every three
years. Second, the Bank's strategy was designed to steadily improve the overall efficiency of CNCA., the
institution responsible for financing the agricultural sector. Deep structural imbalances in this sector had
led the Government and the Bank to launch two successive sectoral adjustment operations (ASAL I in
1985 and ASAL II in 1988) for a total of US$325 million. As both the domestic and the international
economic environments steadily evolved towards more liberalized, private sector-driven, competitive
conditions, continued support to CNCA had to shift its focus progressively towards (i) supporting
increased private sector investment in agriculture, in rural activities and more broadly, in agro-related
export-oriented activities and (ii) helping CNCA to broaden its financial activities by developing new
lending and savings mobilization programs in order to become a full-fledged bank that could compete
with other Moroccan banks. These two considerations were integrated into two successive new
operations launched in 1989 and 1993 respectively: the National Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 3088-
MOR, for US$190 million equivalent) and the National Rural Finance Project (Loan 3662-MOR, for
US$100 million equivalent).
Project Objectives
2.    Both projects had similar objectives aimed at: (i) enhancing productivity of broadly-defined
agricultural activities (farmers, agro-industries, fisheries, exporters of agricultural products, rural artisans'
activities, rural housing, etc.); and (ii) helping CNCA, through an institutional development component,
to carry out its transformation to a bank providing a full range of banking services to rural areas in
increasingly competitive conditions.



iii
3.    The economic (agricultural) development component was supported by credit lines amounting to
US$183 million for Loan 3088-MOR and US$99 million for Loan 3662-MOR. Bank funding, together
with CNCA's own resources and cofinancier funds, was supposed to result in about 450,000 loans made
to targeted activities for the first project and about 340,000 loans made to targeted activities for the
second project. Loans under the first project were expected to be unevenly distributed among small
farmers (27%), medium and large farmers (43%), agro-industries (3%), rural housing (3%), agro-
exporters (3%), fisheries (10%), artisans (2%), and land consolidation (9%). Loans under the second
project were expected to be unevenly distributed among small farmers (26%), medium and large farmers
(43%), agro-industries (10%), rural housing (9%), fisheries (4%), artisans (8%).  The expected
development impact was deemed to be very substantial with FRRs/ERRs ranging from 15% (for sheep
rearing) to 50% (for dairy cattle). The broad range of targeted activities was also the foundation on
which CNCA could build its strategy of loan diversification.
4.    The institutional development component comprised several major elements:
(i)    building a cohesive senior management team to implement necessary institutional
changes with adequate procedures;
(ii)   (re)defining strategic objectives which would be implemented through an appropriate
planning and budgeting process;
(iii)  upgrading the management information system (currently based on manual bookkeeping
operations) to a fully automated system capable of processing data needed to establish
(inter alia) a strong management control system;
(iv)   diversifying the bank's resource base and lending program;
(v)    providing related training;
(vi)   modernizing CNCA's physical infrastructure;
(vii)  maintaining financial viability during this transition, and
(viii)  improving financial strength using a climatic insurance scheme aimed at providing
CNCA with a hedging device against the catastrophic financial consequences of
droughts.
The scale of this institutional development component amounted to a restructuring program,
designed to transform the state of the institution from that of a "Government-sponsored farm credit
disbursement and collection agency" to that of a genuine bank specialized in rural finance.
5.    Most objectives of both projects were relevant. First, financial support to private investments in
Morocco's agriculture, in rural activities, and in other profitable segments of the food industry was
warranted. The support not only helped develop these activities but also contributed to the diversification
of CNCA's lending program. Second, CNCA's institutional transformation and restructuring were also
justified given the new liberalized, competitive environment in which the institution was to evolve. It is
highly questionable whether the Bank took the necessary steps to attain these objectives; specifically the
following measures were lacking in substance or vigor of execution: (a) project preparation by the Bank
including substantial due diligence with respect to CNCA; (b) an assessment of CNCA's institutional,
managerial, organizational and financial situation which was not based solely on the Bank's 25-year
relationship with CNCA; (c) the active involvement during project monitoring and supervision of teams
composed of representatives from CNCA, the Central Bank, and the Bank with expertise in the
implications of CNCA's restructuring; (d) a more realistic approach to the issue of hedging CNCA
against drought risk.



iv
Implementation Experience and Results
6.     Apparently, the first loan (3088-MOR) was deemed to have been successfully implemented.
Quick disbursements and commitments of the credit line and general satisfaction concerning the
implementation of the institutional development component (even though related progress was somewhat
slow, there was optimism about the forthcoming decisions to be made by CNCA) resulted in an eagerness
to prepare a follow-up operation. That operation became effective in February 1994. At that point,
performance started to deteriorate. Contrary to expectations, the Bank's funds did not disburse. Much of
this failure was attributed to the catastrophic drought that occurred in 1994-1995. In fall 1994, however,
CNCA wrote a letter to the Bank expressing concerns about the relative expensiveness of Bank funds
compared to funds available locally or externally through cofinancing, the disadvantages resulting from
the implementation of a new foreign exchange risk coverage scheme, the decline in the exchange rate of
the US dollar, etc. A new Director General was appointed to CNCA in April 1995. At that time, the
Bank's supervision mission expected that further discussions to be held in Washington with the new
Director General would clarify the future of the institutional restructuring components defined in the loan.
7.     The new Director General commissioned KPMG to audit the "quality of the bank's overall
management". In October 1995 that report was published. Devastating conclusions concerning almost
all aspects of CNCA's management and organization emerged from the report. Specifically, KPMG
stressed that (a) the bank's governance, characterized by the autocratic management style adopted by the
Director and by the marginalized role of the board, was very weak; (b) serious deficiencies characterized
CNCA's current work practices (e.g., lack of systematically written procedures); (c) structural
inadequacies crippled the bank's structure (e.g., the ineffectiveness of the internal audit department); (d)
poor credit risk management had compromised the quality of the loan portfolio and resulted in
insufficient provisioning for losses (KPMG noted that several credits had been granted on the basis of
purposely false statements); (e) serious bias in estimating critical assets and liabilities resulted in poor
financial management of the bank; and (f) the competitive position of the bank, initially weak, had further
deteriorated.
8.    Obviously, this bleak picture of CNCA's condition was the result of several years of
deterioration. The initial reaction of the Bank staff in charge of supervising CNCA-related operations to
the KPMG report was somewhat defensive. A long, confusing period of indecision followed. In 1996,
CNCA's internal audit unit also expressed that the opinion that the backbone of the banking business, the
credit chain, was unstable. It was only in April 1997 that the Bank finally officially endorsed the
conclusions of KPMG's report. The Bank admitted that the objective of consolidating the transformation
of CNCA into a competitive universal bank geared to rural finance and to poverty reduction had not been
achieved and would never be under the prevailing circumstances. In the meantime, there was a partial
cancellation of US$50 million, and the Bank considered suspending further disbursements. Since
CNCA's financial situation continued to deteriorate, and the comprehensive restructuring plans submitted
to the Bank were judged unacceptable, the undisbursed portion of the loan (US$25 million) was
cancelled' and US$4 million was reallocated to support CNCA's institutional transformation2. These
actions demonstrated the Bank's recognition that the project had failed to achieve its institutional
development objectives.
According to CNCA, these two cancellations were requested due to the relative expensiveness of the Bank's funds and
the decline in loans refinanced on this line.
2 This amount was ultimately cancelled in April 1998 because CNCA could not use the funds before the loan closed on
March 31, 1998, and did not wish to extend the closing date.



v
9.     Several observations can be made concerning the credit lines. Recent data provided by CNCA
indicate that:
a) For Loan 3088-MOR, CNCA's overall credit program was scaled down by 27%, with substantial
reallocations of funds among the sub-components. Sub-components which were substantially
reduced were: lending to farmers (-36%), lending to fisheries (-81%), and lending to artisans
(-33%). In contrast, two sub-components received large increases in funding: lending to agro-
industries (a more than four-fold increase, including loans to agro-exporters) and lending for
rural housing (+137%). Following a request from CNCA, the loan agreement was amended in
June 1992 to allow reallocations. The changes were requested because CNCA had exhausted
certain cofinanced lines and because of the increase in the US dollar against the dirham. In
retrospect, it may not have been useful to set such specific lending targets for a project of this
nature. In order to ensure that the distribution of the funds is truly demand-driven, it might be
more appropriate to list acceptable sub-components for the project without targeting specific
amounts for each sub-component. For Loan 3088-MOR, the ex post performance of the sub-
components is also unknown since these indicators were never studied by CNCA or by the Bank.
As a result, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable assessment as to whether the objective of
enhancing the productivity of broadly defined agricultural activities has been reached.
Considering the serious suspicions expressed in OED reports on previous Bank loans to CNCA
concerning the reliability of CNCA's credit granting and follow-up processes and the conclusions
of both the 1995 KPMG report and CNCA's internal audit unit work in 1996, it is the opinion of
this mission that the objectives of Loan 3088-MOR were not attained.3
b) In the next project, CNCA reduced its own funding to sub-loan categories even as the Bank
cancelled funds from Loan 3662-MOR and other cofinanciers cancelled their funding. There is
one exception, however: lending to agro-industries on CNCA's own resources increased by 2.5
times. Otherwise, sub-loans to fisheries were reduced by 33%, to rural housing and artisans by
about 66%, and to farmers by about 75%. Globally, the lending program was reduced by 63%,
with cancellations of Bank funding of 79% and cofinancier funding of 720/o4. Since this loan
suffers from the same lack of information described in (a) above, the mission is therefore led to
the same conclusions.
10.    To summarize, overall, the credit lines failed to reach the objectives that were defined in their
respective loan appraisal reports.
3 The borrower disagrees with this opinion. CNCA has commented that since they have no system for evaluating the impact of
loans financed on external funds, there is no way to confirm that the general objectives of Loan 3088-MOR were not
achieved. They note that more than 307,000 clients received financing through the two Bank loans, including 290,694 clients
(4.3 million dirharns) in the agricultural sector. During that period, agricultural GDP rose almost 9%/a in nominal terms.
4 CNCA attributes the decrease in its loan funding, and in part, its requests for cancellation of Bank and cofinancier funds, to
more rigorous credit policies and to the difficult economic and climatic environment in Morocco.



vi
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
11.   The Bank failed to carry out a full and effective due diligence with respect to CNCA. Instead, it
relied on the relationship of trust established over 25 years of cooperation with CNCA and left substantial
parts of the project preparation for both loans to CNCA without adequate analysis or challenge. Sensitive
strategic and technical issues such as the bank's governance, its capacity for accepting and internalizing
the considerable structural changes implied by the introduction of a modern MIS system, its aptitude for
operating under competition, and its capacity to transform itself from a government service into a full-
fledged bank were not addressed substantively. In addition, Bank supervision, both at staff and
management level, was perfunctory. The follow-up of the credit line was reduced to almost nil, and the
follow-up of CNCA's financial health was limited to reading the external auditor's opinions which were
usually unqualified. When the external auditor did note an unacceptable practice such as granting credits
in violation of current bank policies, the supervision mission was satisfied with noting that "according to
reliable sources, the problem has been fixed". No one ever questioned the capacity of CNCA's
management to implement the planned restructuring. There have been Government pressures for CNCA
to lend to small farmers, and the repeated Government-sponsored rescheduling programs in times of
drought contributed to weakening borrowers' financial discipline. The planned restructuring would have
been especially difficult in this environment. Before the 1995 KPMG report, CNCA did not provide the
Bank with proper and reliable information concerning its accomplishments and its difficulties, either
because the institution's top management was unaware of them due to the disorganized state of the bank
or because it preferred not to disturb the status quo.
12.   From the moment that both CNCA and the Bank officially recognized KPMG's conclusions as
reflecting the truly distressed situation of the institution, the Bank has constantly urged its Moroccan
counterparts to provide it with a comprehensive and credible rehabilitation plan. Such a plan would need
to address all aspects of the Bank's reconstruction: from top management (the board of directors, the
executives, etc.) to teller operations to the entire credit process from origination to collection. So far, the
Bank's requests remain unanswered. Plans submitted were rejected as being grossly incomplete and
inadequate. The Bank is committed to providing technical advice, and if an acceptable plan can be
agreed upon together with a reliable commitment by the Moroccans to implement it, the Bank is willing
to provide some appropriate funding for the plan's implementation. In any case, given the seriousness of
CNCA's distress, no new substantial lending similar to Loans 3088-MOR and 3662-MOR is currently
planned.
13.   Despite their generally negative outcome, both projects have generated important and interesting
lessons. First, the Bank should verify that warning signals emerging from factual observations on prior
projects are systematically followed by in-depth investigations aimed at ensuring that future lending
operations are based upon sound criteria.  It should also ensure that the conclusions of these
investigations are duly integrated in SARs and monitored during supervision. Second, the Bank must
verify that its funding is not considered by its borrowers to be a substitute for equity. When Bank loans
are repeatedly granted on a routine basis, they may easily be considered by borrowers as quasi-permanent
resources, a credit window that the lender will hesitate to close because this closing could destabilize the
borrower's situation. Third, credit line developments and outcomes should be given as much attention as
associated institutional change developments and outcomes. Failures in credit line-related processes are
useful devices to detect failures existing elsewhere in the borrower's general organization. Fourth,
projects that at some analytical level involve organizational restructuring should be entrusted to qualified
teams that are aware of the many risks that accompany such transformations. In the case of CNCA, it
was a mistake to rely on financial analysts. Banking specialists would have been better able to design and
supervise the transformation of an agricultural financing institution into a genuine bank. Finally, ]Bank



vii
teams should be renewed frequently in order to avoid complacency, and their project assessments should
be systematically questioned by Bank management to make sure that their conclusions are reliable and
based on solid analysis.

NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROJECT (LOAN No 3662-MOR)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.    Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
Background
1.    Agriculture is an important sector in Morocco's economy. Although its share in GDP declined
from about 30% in the 1960s to between 15% and 18% in the 1970s to 1990s, it accounts for about 40%
of employment and is the leading source of foreign exchange earnings in the economy (about 1/3 of total
exports).
2.    Lending to agriculture in Morocco was a major component of the Bank Group's support strategy.
Since the availability of farm credit is considered a key element for the sector's development, both the
Government and the Bank have focused on creating a specialized financial institution. In 1961 the
Government established the Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) which was designed to be the
major source of farm credit, especially for small farms in rain-fed areas and areas of poverty. As early as
1966, the Bank embarked on a long-term strategy of supporting this institution through a series of loans,
which by May 1989 totaled US$384.4 million. The Bank's strategy attracted the interest of several
cofinanciers (KfW, IFAD, ADB, EIB, USAID, etc.). The combined efforts of the Bank and cofinanciers
succeeded in:  (a) mobilizing capital for private sector investment in Morocco's agriculture; (b)
increasing production while improving food security; (c) upgrading agricultural technology and
productivity; and (d) building a viable farm credit institution.
3.    Morocco has gone through a crucial adjustment process which started in the mid 1980s. The
agricultural sector was the first target of this Bank supported process in 1985 with ASAL I (Loan 2590,
for US$100 million), followed in 1988 by ASAL II (Loan 2885, for US$225 million). A more global
adjustment operation took place in 1988 (Loan 3001, for US$200 million). The underlying philosophy of
these operations was to help Morocco improve its integration in a world characterized by increased global
competition, reduced regulations, and less State intervention.
4.    Within this general new framework, the mission and functions of CNCA had to be reconsidered
for two major reasons. First, after a slowdown in the early 1980s due to droughts, Morocco's agricultural
sector started to grow dynamically by the end of the 1980s, partly as a result of medium-term adjustment
programs which fostered private investments. Private investment in agriculture started to overtake public
investment. New fisheries and agro-industries became major sources of expansion and contributed to
sustained exports. Next, the Second Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan (ITPA II, Loan 2804,
1986, for US$200 million) substantially changed financial intermediation in Morocco. Efforts were being



2
made to simplify the regulatory framework, to reduce distortions in the financial market, and to promote
competition between financial institutions. Despite its specialized nature, CNCA was subjected to
general conditions similar to those constraining other financial intermediaries and had to adjust
accordingly.  CNCA's traditional mission had been to provide credit to stimulate agricultural
development and production as well as improved food self-sufficiency, and its traditional function had
been to promote domestic resource mobilization. CNCA would now also be expected to further develop
private investment in activities with high returns and strong export orientation and to provide a full range
of banking services, placing it in competition with other financial intermediaries. Both sides of its
balance sheet were thus exposed to new risks:  new lending activities on the assets side, and new
borrowing and deposit activities on the liabilities side.
5.    These were the ideas underlying the National Agricultural Credit Project. The project was
initiated in late fall 1987, and an appraisal mission took place in June 1988. The Board approved the
project on June 14, 1989, for an amount of US$190 million equivalent. The project was signed on July
21, 1989, and became effective on September 27, 1989, with a closing date of December 31, 1993. The
project was also supported by the substantial financial involvement of cofinanciers (BAD, BEI, KfW,
OECF, and FADES). The project disbursed more rapidly than expected. One year after effectiveness,
28% of total Bank funds were disbursed, in September 1991, 55%, and in June 1992, 81%. Meanwhile,
Moroccan agriculture was severely affected by a protracted drought in 1991-1993. This situation
prompted the Government in March 1993 to launch an important program designed to support the
agricultural sector and more specifically to mitigate the effects of the farmers' weakened situation on
CNCA. About US$70 million equivalent was planned in order to subsidize interest rates, reduce the
indebtedness of about 350,000 small farmers, and guarantee the rescheduling of the debts of about
120,000 of CNCA's clients. In parallel, by 1992 the Government and CNCA initiated a follow-up
operation: the National Rural Finance Project ("2eme Projet National de Crdit Agricole"), in which the
Bank was quite "naturally" involved, following a preparation mission during April 1992.
,Project objectives
6.    Both projects were prepared in response to requests from CNCA within the framework of its own
development strategy, which was based upon the Government's Development Plan. CNCA's total
project cost was estimated at US$1,532 million equivalent for the first loan from 1989 to 1991. The
amount was reduced to US$1,150 million equivalent for the second loan covering 1993-1996.
7.    Despite minor technical differences, both projects were based on a similar structure of objectives
which consisted of:  (a) setting development impact objectives, i.e. increasing the efficiency of
agricultural activities through investments financed by credit from CNCA and (b) fostering CNCA.'s
institutional development, with a view to integrating the institution into the increasingly competitive
national banking system.
8.    Within the development impact objectives, Loan 3088-MOR was more specific about supporting
new activities related to exports of agro-industries, fisheries, and artisans, while Loan 3662-MC)R
targeted non-farm clients (notably women), enterprises, and young entrepreneurs/graduates and the rural
poor. For the institutional development aspect, Loan 3088-MOR emphasized: (a) converting CNCA
into a full-service bank, with increased managerial autonomy; (b) strengthening CNCA's management
structure and MIS on a decentralized basis; (c) improving CNCA's appraisal procedures, including
environmental impact; (d) developing the skills needed to manage the changed organization; and l(e)
strengthening CNCA's institutional and financial performance. In turn, Loan 3662-MOR was aimed at:
(a) consolidating the institutional transformation of CNCA; (b) introducing a sustainable drought relief
fund/crop insurance system; and (c) developing viable credit and saving schemes suited to the needs of
the rural poor.

9.    Table 1 shows the breakdown of specific sub-activities targeted by both projects and the relative
importance of the credit component in terms of amount of lending anticipated by CNCA. Both loans
provided funds to finance sub-activities in agriculture, rural, and related activities. A very large number
of sub-loans were anticipated for small farmers (about 350,000 and 267,000 for the two projects
respectively). Sub-loans to medium and large farmers were to be more concentrated (about 80,000 and
48,000 respectively). In 1989, no estimate was provided concerning the number of sub-loans to agro-
industries, whereas in 1993, it was estimated to represent about 310 projects. About 2,500-3,000 and
12,500 loans respectively were anticipated for Rural Housing. Financing agro-processing exporters'
working capital was a new project in 1989, without an estimate of the number of possible beneficiaries; it
was further discontinued in 1993. Under both projects, CNCA was to expand experimental saving and
lending schemes for artisans and non-farm rural activities into selected areas with 'the global objective of
ultimately financing about 14,000 sub-loans. Additionally, the second loan was intended to finance about
435 sub-loans to young entrepreneurs/graduates. Finally, a land consolidation credit program (not funded
by the Bank) was designed to give private farmers access to credit to purchase land; the number of
beneficiaries was not estimated, but the amount of planned credit was significantly decreased between the
first (US$100 million equivalent) and the second project (US$7 million).
10.   As indicated in Table 1, CNCA's institutional strengthening was more modest in terms of
financial effort even though it was considered a critical component. Several institutional areas were
targeted by both loans. First, the organizational structure had to be revised in order to meet the needs of a
growing institution that the Government wanted to see evolve towards a full-service bank. This required
that an effective planning and management control unit (PMCU) would be established, with adequate
means available in terms of computerization, MIS, and accounting. This was an objective of the 1989
project, further re-emphasized in 1993. Second, both projects included a training component aimed at
improving CNCA staff's knowledge in various fields related to the banking business (credit appraisal,
portfolio management, etc.). A total of about 1,000 employees were to be trained under both projects.
Third, technical assistance (TA), provided by consultants and experts, was expected to speed up CNCA's
reform process in both cases, and in 1993, a pilot Climatic Risk Insurance Fund was added as an
objective requiring adequate TA. Fourth and finally, the two projects differed substantially in their last
component. The 1989 project was assigned the objective of financing improvements CNCA's physical
infrastructure, whereas the 1993 project was more focused on setting up a Climatic Risk Insurance Fund
for the protection of farmers and an agricultural insurance scheme, although these elements were not
designed to be Bank financed.

slightly different categories.
IEvaluation of objectives
11.    The objectives of both projects were clearly spelled out, and given the situation in Morocco, most
of them were apparently very relevant. The country's needs both to provide substantial support to an
important segment of the working population and to increase agricultural productivity and generate
export revenues largely justified the credit lines. In addition, even though Morocco's agricultural bank
was considered until the late 1980s as the best example of a success story in this area, the new financiial
environment that had been evolving since 1986 with ITPA 1I, a process that accelerated in 1991 when the
Bank granted a Financial Development Loan to Morocco, meant that CNCA would have to renovate and
modernize itself in order to survive in this more demanding environment.
12.    We have one important reservation concerning the objective of setting up of the Climatic Risk
Insurance Fund. One aspect of this Fund was to provide CNCA with a hedging device against the risk of



5
non-repayment of loans made to farmers hit by droughts5. Given that drought recurrence frequency is
about three years on average in Morocco and that rain-fed grain crops are the most sensitive to droughts,
there were ecological and agricultural issues to address before devising a financial device. Drought-
related risks should first have been considered from both physical and economic standpoints: whether
drought sensitive areas should be cultivated at all and whether they should be used for grains. Prior to
establishing a complex financial institution, basic reflections along the lines of Ricardian economics
(from the cultivating of less fertile lands, to the law of comparative advantage taking into account the
economic returns) were warranted.
13.   Two major risks were mentioned in both SARs: the drought-related risk and the risk that CNCA
would not be transformed into a full-service bank. Other than the plan to create an insurance scheme
against the financial consequences of severe droughts, it was estimated in both projects that, based on
past experiences, drought would not substantially affect CNCA since the institution (a) had adopted
prudent credit practices, (b) had systematically received the financial support of donors, and (c) had
regularly benefited from government's measures aimed at cushioning, directly or indirectly, the
consequences of droughts on CNCA's financial viability. The risk that CNCA would not be reorganized
as planned was also deemed to be minimal based on the assumption that the "quality ofCNCA's current
management [would be] maintained".
B.    Achievement of Objectives
14.   The following assessment will be based on a global view of both operations together and in order
to provide a better understanding, on chronological developments. We will nevertheless distinguish
between the credit component and the institutional development component of the projects because the
underlying logic of each is very different. Supervision missions focused heavily on the institutional
development component, treating the line of credit itself as a very minor subject. As a result, over the life
of the project there were imbalances between the financial amounts involved via the credit lines (98% of
total lending) and the amount of attention that were respectively devoted to each component (perhaps 5%
for the credit line and 95% for the institutional aspects).
15.   The credit line started quite well, at least for Loan 3088-MOR. From the beginning both
commitments and disbursements progressed rapidly. At the end of March 1990, the loan was 12%
disbursed and 35% committed. A little more than a year later, the loan was 50% disbursed and 65%
committed. At the same time, funds provided by most othercofinanciers (ADB, EIB, KfW and FADES)
were being disbursed even more quickly than Bank funds. There was one exception: OECF, the
Japanese agency, did not appraise the project until August 1991 and actually did not finance it. Instead it
committed to provide funding for the follow-up operation. Also, in the course of the lending process
some categories (e.g., fisheries) were not disbursing as fast as others (e.g., agro-industries). As a result
of both the non-involvement of OECF and uneven sub-sectoral disbursements, the Bank agreed in
November 1991 to amend the Loan Agreement by reallocating Bank funds available among related
activities. In April 1993, a Bank mission went to Morocco, both to supervise the current loan and to pre-
appraise a follow-up operation. Based on the more than timely disbursements and on the active financial
involvement of most of the Bank's partners, the Bank estimated that this component had been
5 The Annex to the SAR dealing with this Fund clearly indicates that "it should be made mandatory for borrowers of CNCA to
take out a drought insurance policy and would be useful to other commercial banks." [SAR, 1993, Annex 13, para 12, p.87].
In addition, it is stated that "CNCA and other banks (would benefit) from (a) partial or full repayment of short-term loans in
the event of crop shortfall or damage...." [ibid., para 21, p.89].

successfully implemented in such a way that the follow-up operation (the National Rural Finance Project
which was to become Loan 3662-MOR) could proceed with a planned decision of the RLC on April 22,
1993. Therefore, if an ICR had been completed for the first project alone, with an assessment only on the
timely flow of disbursements, it would have led to the conclusion that the credit line component
successfully reached its objectives. The reality, however, is different.
16.    As shown in Table 2, after reallocations the targeted sub-sectors received amounts different from
those initially planned in the SAR. Loans to agro-exporters were merged into the agro-industry category.
Most sub-loans went to medium to large farmers and agro-businesses at the expense of fisheries aLd
greenhouses. It is also probable that rural housing sub-loans were primarily granted to the wealthiest,
most creditworthy rural households.

17.    Some degree of flexibility in loan allocations is a good thing and fund reallocations are therefore
acceptable if, for instance, there is a strong underlying demand. In retrospect, it may not have been
useful to set such specific lending targets for a project of this nature. In order to ensure that the
distribution of the funds is truly demand-driven, it might be more appropriate to list acceptable sub-
components for the project without targeting specific amounts for each sub-component. However, in this
case the expected allocation was set, and therefore the new allocation should have been justified and
documented based on economic grounds, not only on an ex ante basis when sub-loans are appraised, but
more importantly on an ex post basis when sub-loans are monitored. This is one major issue. The SAR
relied on "CNCA's monitoring and evaluation unit [in order] to collect and consolidate the data on
commitments and disbursements under sub-loans, physical achievements under selected subprojects,
operational results of representative investment operations, and recovery performance"6. In turn, data
provided by CNCA would have allowed the Bank to assess the real impact, whether it would have been

measured in terms of incremental net farmers' and investors' income, or in terms of economic benefits
(ERRs) or increased related export performance. This was never done, and therefore the question of
whether the project attained its development objectives remains unanswered.
18.    The follow-up operation (Loan 3662-MOR) was launched and became effective on February
1994. Justifications for this new loan were, inter alia, based on "Lessons learned from Past Agricultural
Credit Projects"7, and more specifically on OED reports as well as on previous project completion reports
(PCRs). Unfortiunately, these documents state very clearly that the real related impact is unknown8.
Nevertheless, the SAR-1993 was anticipating substantial impacts on farmers' and investors' income, on
economic benefits (ERRs varying from 25% to 50%). In 1992, 1993, and 1995, Morocco was hit again
by severe droughts. There were no Bank loan disbursements in 1994 or in 1995. It was February 1996
when disbursements began, for US$21 million. This first disbursement was also the last one. Both the
Bank and the Moroccan counterparts began to consider possible cancellations. After many mishaps, the
balance of the loan was ultimately cancelled. Table 3 shows how the disbursed funds were used.

7  SAR-1993, para 2.09, p.3.
8 The SAR-1993 contains an Annex 10 which is supposed to give a more detailed description of the previous "projects'
performance and development impact". However, there are no such details in the document, except one reference to the 3rd
Agricultural Credit Project covering the period 1977-1980, and references to PCR No 11492 of December 30, 1992 and to
OED's PPAR No 11491 of January 22, 1993 which both cover the 5th and 6th Agricultural Credit Project. In turn, these
documents clearly express that: "...neither CNCA's own PCRs nor project files provide information as to the impact of these
projects in terms of the number of beneficiaries and employment" [PCR, Report No 11492, para 3.32, p. 14 1 and that: "...no
current data are available on the farm-level impact of the two projects" [PAR, Report No 11491, para 3.1, p.6.]. The first
supervision report related to the Ln 3662-MOR (May 31, 1994) nevertheless stated that "En depit de deux annees de
secheresse (1992 et 1993), le Projet [Loan 3088-MOR] a eu globalement un impact positifsur le developpement du secteur
agricole et rural au Maroc grdce au dynamisme de la CNCA et a sa capacite d'adaptation exceptionnelle a surmonter les
difficultds conjoncturelles" [Aide-Memoire, para 5., p.1]. Obviously, such a vague and general statement can't stand instead
of analytical and/or statistical evidence.

19.    To summarize, (a) project financing figures differ substantially between the SARs and the Loan
Agreements (not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively because categories are sometimes different),
(b) the final allocations also differed from those originally planned, with no reliable explanation, and (c)
the ultimate impact on agricultural development is unknown. Our conclusion is that the development
objective was not attained for either loan.9 Recent data provided by CNCA (Table 4) show that neither
credit allocations related to Loan 3088-MOR, nor those related to Loan 3662-MOR were quantitatively
implemented as initially planned. First, the final credit allocations related to Loan 3088-MOR were
reduced by 27%. This is the combined result of a dramatic reduction of cofinanciers' final fttnding
(neither FADES, EIB, nor OECF ultimately contributed to the financing) and of a substantial redluction
(-22%) of local (primarily CNCA) financing. Moreover, while CNCA noticeably reduced its financing to
farmers (-43%), fisheries (-39%) and artisans (-29%), it increased its financing to agro-industries
tremendously (+1,326%). CNCA increased its own financial contribution to agro-industries from US$5
million, as initially planned, to US$101.4 million. This trend persisted with Loan 3662-MOR: CNCA's
funding to agro-industries was expected to be US$35 million but eventually totaled US$64 million.
Second, the large cancellations of external funding related to Loan 3662-MOR significantly changed the
whole project.

20.    The combined projects did not successfully achieve the institutional development objectives.
Supervision reports for Loan 3088-MOR did not usually contain specific factual indications that could
have allowed a concrete assessment of the real progress in institutional development. The reports
available are very general and sometimes sketchy concerning past achievements. Instead, they focused
primarily on changes expected to be made by CNCA. Supervision of the financial health of the bank

relied almost exclusively on the auditors' reports and their unqualified opinions. The monitoring of
financial covenants was also based on specific reports drafted by the same auditors. There is no
indication that the Bank ever tried to verify the auditors' opinions or calculations.
21.   Expected institutional changes were considered from favorable a priori views. For instance, in
April-May 1992, the Aide-Memoire to the Government noted: "La CNCA a une excellente vision
strategique de son developpement."I° In May 1993, another supervision mission was satisfied with the
steps achieved by CNCA in terms of organizational structure: the establishment of several new units at
headquarters for Branch Network and Development, Human Resources and Logistics, Loan and Portfolio
Management, International Activities, and Data Processing. The mission also relied on promises to set
up, within the next few months, "the Financial Vice Presidency, the General Inspectorate, the Office of
the Auditor, the Strategic Planning Office, and the Office of General Studies". Despite some delays in
implementation, the Bank was also satisfied with the installation of the new Strategic Planning and
Management Control (the GAPSET System) and with the choice of Steria (a consulting firm) which
would advise CNCA to upgrade and modernize its central computer system. CNCA's operational
diversification was deemed satisfactory considering the expansion of the volume of foreign banking
operations. Lastly, the mission noted that one of the factors that hampered the autonomy of the bank was
the existence of the a priori approval of the Government's controller for purchases, a procedure that had
never been formally abolished. "
22.   In May 1994, a mission went to Morocco both to assess the implementation performance of Loan
3088-MOR and to ensure a smooth transition for Loan 3662-MOR. The related supervision report
mentioned the following positive achievements: the new organization at headquarters, the new network
organization, the installation of the management control system (the GAPSET system), satisfactory
developments concerning the central computer system which would be fully operational in 1996, and the
existing training program. Most developments were rated favorably.
23.   In 1995 several important factors combined to change the views concerning both projects
radically. Another severe drought occurred, and Loan 3662-MOR was not disbursing. A new Director
General was appointed to CNCA by the Government in April, and major changes in CNCA's top
management followed. Most importantly, in October 1995 a KPMG audit report, which had been
commissioned by the Government, was published. This audit report focused on CNCA's major
institutional features: the branch network, human resource management, MIS, the management control
system, the internal audit department, and the management of overhead expenses. The report also
closely surveyed CNCA's basic financial indicators and the quality of its loan portfolio"2. Based on
extensive investigations, the report listed the following conclusions:
(a)          The bank's governance was particularly weak prior to the streamlining
introduced in June 1995 by the newly appointed Director General. It was characterized by:
- an insufficient number of board meetings (once year at most) with poor attendance and lack of
continuity,
- no formal meetings of the steering committee,

Memoire, p.2.

12 KPMG produced in October 1995 a preliminary report. It was further completed by a more thorough analysis in December
1995.

- the Director General's authoritative management style, based on non-cooperative arrangements, a
parallel hierarchy of advisers, and a failure to use basic management tools such as a medium-tenn
planning process, a related budgeting procedure, and the monitoring of normal activity indicators.
(b)           The current work practices were seriously deficient because (i) no written
operations manual was available; (ii) many services were pursuing self-serving objectives; and (iii)
proactive market-driven behaviors remained under-developed.
(c)           The bank's structure revealed serious failures such as: a neglected branch
network, poorly managed human resources which resulted in overstaffing, an outdated MIS, the
inadequacy of the management control system, excessive overhead expenses, and the incapability of
the internal audit departnent to perform its activities.
(d)           The management of credit risk was extremely poor and had compromised the
quality of the loan portfolio and resulted in insufficient provisioning for loan losses. The main
deficiencies reported were that: intentional false statements were found in loan request files to
support credit decisions that were not economically justified; credits had been granted on a
discretionary basis; uncontrolled loan concentrations existed; project appraisal was superficial;
conditions and guarantees which had been requested by the loan committee were not obtained; basic
credit risk control procedures were not implemented; debt rescheduling was excessive; and finally,
loan monitoring and supervision was poor. As a result, in December 1995, KPMG's estimate of
CNCA's insufficient loan-loss provisioning as of 12/31/1994 was between 1,315 million DH and
1,850 million DH, in a total loan portfolio of 4,031 million DH'3.
(e)           The financial management of the bank was not as good as expected. The
volume of troubled assets was probably underestimated due to the significant amount of receivables
subjected to further litigation. Even though the bank's liquidity was satisfactory, it remained highly
dependant upon the sustained confidence of both international donors and Moroccan depositors.
Even the bank's low profits were apparently misleading due to insufficient provisioning. Finally, the
bank's capital adequacy ratio (8.2% by the end of 1994) although sufficient in legal terms14 was
inadequate with regard to CNCA's overall weakness.
(f)           CNCA was ill-positioned in the increasingly competitive Moroccan banking
environment. The size of the bank (ranked second in terms of teller windows and staffing, third in
terms of credits, and ninth in terms of deposits) was not supported by adequate performance
indicators: in the credit market its share had declined from 16% in 1990 to 13.5% in 1994; in the
deposits market its share had stabilized at a low 3%; CNCA had the worst staff efficiency ratios
despite wages that were about 25% lower than those paid by competitors; and lastly, CNCA ranked
last with regard to the quality of its loan portfolio.
24.    A long period of indecision followed. It was only in April 1997 when, following a mid-term
review of Loan 3662-MOR'5, the Bank admitted that the objective of "consolidating the institutional
transformation of CNCA into a competitive universal bank geared to rural finance and poverty focus"
was not being achieved and would never be achieved under the prevailing circumstances. In the
13 Alftough this was not calculated by KPMG, we could add that, with CNCA's capital ("Fonds propres") totaling DH 1,746
million (as of 12/31/1994), the insufficient loan-loss provisioning represented between 75% and 106% of the bank's equiity.
14 Moroccan banks are required to maintain a capital adequacy ratio of at least 8%.
5 This mid-term review was conducted jointly with the Caisse Franqaise de Developpement (CFD) and Kreditanstalt fur
Waederaujbau (KfW), two major co-donors associated with the project.



11
meantime (October 1995-April 1997) CNCA had consumed all its equity capital and its institutional
structure further deteriorated. After a partial cancellation of US$50 million in 1996, the Bank later
indicated to the borrower that further disbursements might be suspended. This threat was not
implemented because the Moroccan counterparts submitted a restructuring plan, although the plan was
judged very unsatisfactory. In October 199716 the Bank decided, upon the formal request of CNCA, to
cancel the undisbursed portion of the loan (US$25 million) while reallocating US$4 million to support
CNCA's institutional transformation"7. These actions amounted to the recognition that the project almost
completely failed to achieve its institutional development objectives. In addition, this failed experiment
was much more expensive than expected (Table 4, above): whereas CNCA was expected to spend about
US$3 million with Loan 3088-MOR and US$500,000 for Loan 3662-MOR, it actually spent US$37.6
million (a 1,075% increase) and US$48 million (a 9,520% increase)8, respectively.
C.    Major Factors Affecting the Project
25.    Initial conditions were not properly assessed. Apparently, the Bank's 25 year relationship with
CNCA developed in a cooperative and courteous manner. Both institutions were satisfied with this
mutually advantageous situation. CNCA had a reliable, stable source of long-term funding all the more
appealing since it acted as a magnet to attract long-term funds from othercofinanciers, and the Bank had
a good client which disbursed its funds, complied with its covenants and requirements, and (because the
loans were guaranteed by the Government) would not default on its debt. This relationship weakened the
vigilance that a bank should maintain vis-a-vis its clients. Lending to CNCA became a routine exercise.
PCRs and OED audit reports were issued on the basis of two sequenced loans which introduced
damaging lags in assessing the projects, and consecutive SARs started to be nearly identical in substance,
with only minor changes and minor adjustments in figures when necessary and without a reasonable
delay between projects to permit the inclusion of lessons from past experiences.
26.     The Bank relied on CNCA's reputation as a successful agricultural credit bank. Sensitive issues
were minimized or not addressed at all. For instance, whereas OED's PAR of 199219 expresses serious
doubts concerning "the farm-level impact of the two projects [because] no current data are available", the
Bank's 1993 SAR states that "OED reports stress the contribution made by the projects to agricultural
development"20. Basic strategic and/or technical issues related to CNCA's governance were hardly raised
and not further addressed. Testimony to this is the fact that the Bank ultimately agreed to the dissolution
of the management committee2", and amended the Loan Agreement, on the basis of both (a) the
conclusion of a supervision mission that found "a new dynamism characterizing CNCA's new top

management in 1987", and (b) indications that the board of directors would be strengthened. The issues
of MIS, computerization, the management control system, and overall management, which were raised as
early as 1983, during the appraisal of the fifth Agricultural project, were closely related to these
decisions. Such topics raise the issue of the whole organizational structure of a bank, including that of
the distribution of powers within the institution. 22
27.    In retrospect, even though the objectives of the project were generally relevant, the project design
was not. Initial project design flaws were serious. They can be approached from different aspects of
both projects. There were considerable debates both within CNCA and between CNCA and the B3ank
about the issue of introducing a modem and fully computerized MIS in 1985 (i.e., well before the two
projects being discussed in this report). These symptomatic developments should have immediately
alerted the Bank to the fact that the overall organizational culture and structure was not suited to
internalize this kind of change. It should also have triggered the Bank's request to have an "institutional
diagnostic effort and preliminary institutional development measures"23. Such a diagnostic would have
involved an across-the-board review of the information and power distribution chain within the
institution, from the board of directors to the bottom staff of the bank.
28.    Transforming a government-owned specialized financial institution into a full-fledged universal
bank that could compete with other banks in an increasingly competitive environment was not a task. that
could be reasonably dealt with by financial analysts working in a division specializing in agriculture.
Meetings and discussions held at various levels within the Bank before the approval of Loan 3662-MOR
were, to some extent, unrealistic and did not improve the situation. For instance, from minutes of a RLC
issued on April 27, 1993, it appears that opening CNCA to competition would essentially mean that it
would initially target the "higher group" (large farmers and agro-industrialists) of potential clients, and
offer saving products outside rural areas. OED's remark that "[there is a] high level of arrears among
borrowers who are potentially CNCA's best clients" (i.e., those belonging to the "higher group") should
have been taken as a warning signal. Similarly, no one questioned what the other banks' reaction would
be when they realized that a government-supported institution was competing with them.  The
Department's explanation that "CNCA was a well-managed bank, which stood out as a rare success
among many failures in the world of agricultural credit" was accepted without further discussion. Yet
there were other warning signals in the OED report: CNCA's failure to increase savings mobilization, its
excessive dependence upon external liabilities, the understatement of the gravity of the arrears situation,
etc. In addition, CNCA has always been under pressure from the Government to lend to small farmers.
Repeated Government-sponsored debt rescheduling programs in times of drought have not only placed a
burden on CNCA's financial condition, they may also have weakened borrowers' financial discipline.
This issue of whether, from a political perspective, CNCA would truly be able to change its lending
practices was apparently never raised.
22 See for example Diana McNaughton, Banking Institutions in Developing Markets, The World Bank, 1992, Vol. 1, pages I to
4; and in the same book, the Appendix 5, written by Khalifa Ikramullah: "Information Technology in the Banking Industry",
who emphasizes that "Information systems increasingly alter relationships, patterns of communication, authority and control"
(p. 156).
23 Khalifa Ikramullah: "Information Technology in the Banking Industry", op.cit., p. 157. This author observes that "a
strategy for implementing MIS, for example, must therefore recognize and deal with the politics of data and opposing
influences. Introducing automation usually requires a major change in the organizational culture and generates resistance
(p. 156)... (. . .). .. an automated system requires a high degree of structured and defined procedures and controls to function
effectively. (...). Unless the basic organizational and data framework has been rationalized, a premature introduction of IT
can exacerbate inherent problems and deficiencies (p. 157)".

29.   During implementation, Bank supervision remained superficial. In spite of frequent supervision
missions and extensive "Aide-Memoires" written and serving as BTORs, in-depth analysis of pending
issues was absent and Bank management did not ask the relevant questions. On one hand, the kind of
agricultural development which was supposed to be supported by the loan was not examined.
Diversification of lending towards more sophisticated segments of the broadly defined food-processing
chain was a good move but was never closely supervised. Explanations provided to Bank staff
concerning the poor performance of planned lending to agro-exporters and to fisheries were accepted
without further investigations of the real causes, and this probably explains why support to these market
segments was discontinued or scaled down during the 3662-MOR project. On the other hand, both
projects' supervision focused heavily, at least apparently, on institutional development. Again, however,
this focus was largely superficial: assessments of CNCA's financial structure and health relied almost
exclusively on the final conclusions of the external auditors' reports, which were unqualified until 1995.
Some cross-checking was warranted, and supervision reports are remarkably empty of relevant related
figures. The supervision report dated October 30, 1995 provides a good example of the absence of
analytical curiosity. The extemal auditors mentioned that unauthorized credits had been granted to a few
clients by CNCA's branches in Casablanca and Mohamedia. The supervision report only mentions that
"according to reliable sources, the problem has been fixed", whereas this incident should have triggered
additional factual investigations. The monitoring of institutional developments remained focused on a
few topics that had been deemed important from the beginning: the issue of loan arrears and the
collection ratio, the introduction of a management control system, and the development of a MIS. Lags
and implementation delays were noticed and sometimes explained, but the reader's attention was
systematically diverted towards what would or should happen in the future. In addition these
expectations remained very general, without reference to technical issues, and more importantly without
questioning the relevance of such actions by placing them in an appropriate conceptual context.
30.   Droughts that occurred in 1992, 1993, and 1995 obviously aggravated CNCA's financial
situation, but probably no more than previous droughts since CNCA continued to benefit from
exceptional supports from both the Government and donors. A balance sheet restructuring including an
885 million DH recapitalization, a 1,450 million DH allowance to a new guarantee fund to finance
doubtful loans, and more stringent recovery actions was planned in February 1996.
31.   Nevertheless, the two major, inter-related factors that affected the project were:  1) the
appointment in April 1995 of a new Director General at CNCA who pursued the conclusions of the May
1995 preliminary internal analysis that showed the "weakness of the means in equipment, human
resources and financial resources available to the institution in order to carry on its mission" and
commissioned (with the Government's support) an extensive institutional and financial audit of CNCA;
and 2) the subsequent publication of KPMG's audit. In retrospect, these factors must be considered as
having had a positive impact on the project. The new Director General, with his new management team,
helped overcome the complacent relationship that had prevailed both within CNCA and between CNCA
and the Bank. In turn, KPMG's audit revealed the real substance of the projects. This report highlighted
the severe deficiencies characterizing critical components of CNCA's organizational and financial
structure. It also helped convince the Bank that in order to save scarce resources it should cancel the
undisbursed portion of the loan. Finally, it laid new, sounder grounds on which the institution could be
rebuilt.
32.   When the Bank had finally accepted the conclusion that the project was not meeting its
objectives, a new team was appointed and went in the field for the planned mid-term review in April
1997. This mission was preceded by preliminary discussions in Paris with CFD and KfW, which resulted
in recognizing the necessity of "refocusing the mission to save the CNCA institution, [while] a review of



14
project components was relatively unimportant". The mission observed the further deterioration of
CNCA's financial situation (losses of at least DH 255 million, alarming loan concentrations in non-
agricultural activities with related arrears of DH 1.3 billion, unwarranted government burdens imposed on
CNCA, non-compliance with capital adequacy requirements; poor liquidity) rcflecting more serious
institutional problems. Three priority rehabilitation areas were defined: (a) institutional rehabilitation
including the distribution of authority and responsibilities, the organizational mission, and personnel
policy; (b) functional rehabilitation related to procedures, logistics, organization and control, and
computerization; and (c) operational rehabilitation, including reconstruction of the credit commitment
chain in order to stop the "financial hemorrhage".
33.   The new dialogue started with the visit of a CNCA delegation to Washington in July 1997. The
Moroccans provided the Bank with a restructuring plan, with the expectation that the Bank would
approve of at least the philosophy of the plan. The Bank's experts promptly discovered, however, that
the plan was far from what would be required in terms of both institutional reorganization (especially the
bank's governance) and financial reorganization. Bank staff urged their Moroccan counterparts to
develop a more appropriate plan. When CNCA requested the cancellation of the US$25 million and the
reallocation of US$4 million for institutional development purposes in October 1997, the Bank agreed,
hoping that substantial financial support would encourage CNCA's efforts to reorganize. Another new
Director General of CNCA, appointed in October 1997, recruited a new management team which made
significant progress in reorganizing the bank's marketing orientation and the controls and management
information systems, but a coherent long-term strategic focus, both institutional and financial, was still
lacking. In January 1998, CNCA requested the cancellation of the remaining US$4 million, and the loan
was ultimately closed on March 31, 1998, with major issues still unresolved. A supervision mission that
went to Morocco in March/April 1998 still rated the major institutional developments and CNCA's
financial viability as unsatisfactory.
D.    Project Sustainability
34.    Currently, CNCA's overall institutional situation is not sustainable.  Steps that have been
accomplished so far are insufficient and incoherent and could not result in a viable institution.
(a)       The economic environment in which CNCA exists (the agricultural sector and its
rural components) needs to be reassessed, and new and innovative agricultural policies
developed24. The current agricultural system provides too many incentives to farmers to
"increase production in marginal, drought-prone areas where the economic return might be a
far cry from the financial one and may also result in a net loss to the whole economy" In
this area, the Government has difficult but unavoidable decisions to make that will affect the
future of CNCA.
(b)       As shareholder, the Government is also faced with critical choices. First, CNCA's
by-laws transforming the bank into an ordinary limited liability company have yet to be
approved. This would clarify the issues of both the board of directors and the responsibilities
of the Government and CNCA. However, the Government does not seem to hlave
relinquished the option of creating an external steering committee (Comite Directeur
Externe), which would introduce unnecessary external interference and dilute the
responsibilities of the bank's management. Second, the Government has to contribute
24 An office memorandum drafted on July 10, 1987 by Jacob Yaron emphasizes this necessity.



15
actively to CNCA's financial rehabilitation by revising, as agreed with the cofinanciers, its
position concerning the foreign exchange risk burden, settling its own arrears to CNCA,
finalizing its financial share of the recapitalization, clarifying its position concerning the
ultimate use of the DH 950 million provided for rescheduling the farmer's debt, etc.
(c)        CNCA itself has, since October 1997, made some good choices concerning its
organizational chart, its branch network, its credit operations, its marketing activities, the
mobilization of its human resources, the improvement of the bank's net operating income,
and a more flexible computerization strategy. However, CNCA's medium and long-term
strategy, supported by a reliable action plan, has yet to be defined. In addition to that, the
bank's financial situation appears to have further deteriorated in 1997 as a result of several
factors, some of which the bank can control (salary expenses, lack of provisioning, poor
results in recovering the amounts past due from about 50 large non-agricultural clients which
total about DH 1,317 million). CNCA notes that this apparent deterioration is largely due to
the stricter accounting treatment for loan loss provisions in the Central Bank's prudential
regulations. The 1997 financial statements may therefore be giving a clearer picture of
CNCA's on-going financial distress rather than indicating further deterioration in 1997. In
any case, the financial situation needs urgent attention and action since CNCA will have no
credible future until it is placed on a solid financial footing.
E.    Bank Performance
35.    Bank performance has fluctuated. It has evolved from unsatisfactory for project preparation, to
highly unsatisfactory for project supervision until 1996, and ultimately to satisfactory for project
supervision from 1996 to now. Project file maintenance by the Bank was poor over a long time period,
until 1996. Too many documents reported to be included in projects files were missing, and it has taken
this mission a great deal of time to reconstruct a minimal data base of files by combining what was
available in the original and current division files and what had been transferred to Bank archives.
36.    Project preparations were unsatisfactory. Both projects were "identified and prepared by CNCA
with the assistance of Bank missions supervising a previous Agricultural Credit Project"25 (Loans 2731-
MOR and 3088-MOR respectively). They were further "appraised by a Bank mission". Project
ownership by Bank borrowers is generally considered to be a positive factor, and while this concept
remains valid, the Bank must retain its right to judge the advisability of projects on a case by case basis,
starting with identification, preparation, and appraisal. The Bank failed to carry out sound and
independent due diligence. It is obvious, especially from the BTO reports, that both projects were
routinely prepared by CNCA, and that the Bank continued the "business as usual" practices that had
characterized its 25-year relationship with CNCA without verifying important information. Thus,
KPMG's 1995 report stated that "financial projections given in World Bank reports only consist of
extrapolations of balance sheet and operating account figures provided 'upon request"'26. This also
indicates that the preparation may have been embellished. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain the very
attractive ex ante FRRs and ERRs that were included in the reports but later could not be verified27.
25 SAR-1989, page 2, para 1.04, and SAR-1993, page 1, para 1.04.
26 KPMG's report, October 1995, page 12.
27 Cf. supra, para 17, and more specifically the footnote 8.



16
37.    The objectives changed considerably between the previous lending operation (loan 2731 -MOR)
and these two projects. The goal of transforming CNCA into a full-fledged competitive bank involved
systemic changes which the Bank's team was not equipped to handle. For such a large-scale change, the
Bank's team should have included a full preliminary review of CNCA's management and activities in the
project to make sure that CNCA would be able to implement the restructuring.
38.    Project supervision was unsatisfactory for a long period. First, too little attention was paid to the
quantitative and qualitative aspects of both the actual allocations of the Bank's credit line andCNCA's
credit process.  As a result, the economic and financial justification of Bank funding remains
questionable. A basic review would have allowed the Bank to discover what OED suspected (see above,
footnote 19) and what was found by KPMG in October 1995 and by CNCA's internal auditors in
September 199628, namely that the entire credit process was unacceptable and needed to be rehabilitated.
39.    When the facts concerning CNCA's real situation were finally established and new teams were
appointed to follow up, the Bank's supervision dramatically improved. The Bank correctly would not
endorse the vague rescue measures that were proposed by CNCA. It then adequately pointed out which
in-depth adjustments and reforms would be necessary before formalizing further Bank support and
consistently followed the progress, or lack thereof, made by Moroccan counterparts.
F.     Borrower Performance
40.    Borrower performance has been highly unsatisfactory over the projects' life. The autocratic
management that characterized CNCA until 1995 was even more inappropriate because it was
strengthened by (a) the compartmentalization of and a strict control over the information flows related to
the institution, (b) the reliance on a small group of personal advisers informally given power, and (c) a
behavior that neglected to base the bank's strategic and operational policies upon the use of standard
management tools. As a result, it is very likely that since both projects were prepared by CNCA with
assistance from Bank supervision missions, information conveyed to the Bank was biased in order to
minimize factors might have engendered the Bank's questions.
41.    Both projects seemed to evolve in similar fashions until October 1995, when KPMG's report was
published. The magnitude of problems facing CNCA was such that it became impossible to further
ignore them. This report was apparently not officially transmitted to the Bank before March/April
199629. On the other hand, CNCA's management should be praised for its initiative in commissioning
this investigation, as well as its initiative in askingCNCA's internal audit unit to investigate the reliability
of the whole credit process. Unfortunately, no comprehensive, meaningful plan to resolve CNCA's
problems resulted from these initiatives. Plans submitted to the Bank and other cofinanciers were
rejected as incomplete and superficial. The proposed recapitalization of CNCA by the Government may
be insufficient, and radical measures must be taken to isolate CNCA from undue Govermnent
28 These findings are reported in F.X. Bordeaux report for the joint IBRD-CFD-KFW mission, April 7-17, 1997, pages 6 and 7.
29 According to information found in Bank files, KPMG's report was first mentioned on October 30, 1995, in the
"Implementation Summary" (page 3, para 5.02) of the Supervision Report. It was referred to on March 15, 1996, in the
TORs of the Bank's consultant participating in the upcoming supervision mission. The BTO report dated April 18, 1996
mentions the existence of KPMG's report, and it is also mentioned in the full supervision report dated May 13, 1996 (with
the comment "these reports have serious shortcomings"). A memo dated April 22, 1996 spends time rebutting KPMG's
report as mostly politically oriented.

interference and to allow the bank to operate on a commercial basis. These measures include but may not
be limited to CNCA's transformation into a joint-stock company. If CNCA is intended to implement the
Government's rural/agricultural policy, this must be clearly defined in contract with the Government
compensating CNCA for this work. Progress was made in some areas, but as of April 7, 1998, the Bank
and its financial partners noted that a coherent action plan had not yet been developed. Such a plan
would involve the three concerned Moroccan counterparts (CNCA, the Government, and the Central
Bank), and should include: (a) a 5-year financial rehabilitation program with a realisticrecapitalization
plan, (b) further organizational changes, (c) a major collection effort targeting CNCA's 58 biggest non-
agricultural debtors, (d) the definition of a global strategy for agricultural finance in Morocco and
CNCA's role in that strategy, (e) the adoption of CNCA's new by-laws, and (f) closer supervision of
CNCA by the Central Bank. Therefore, taking into account the fact that considerable time has been lost,
the borrower's performance must still be considered as unsatisfactory. This judgement is consistent with
the most recent May 8, 1998 rating by a Bank mission which rightly attributed the problems to the
Government and to the borrower's lack of commitment.
G.    Assessment of Outcome
42.   The combined outcome of both projects' credit lines is rated unsatisfactory. As mentioned
before, there is no substantial evidence that the credit component succeeded in improving agricultural
performance, or even in supporting agricultural development. On the contrary, two factors indicate the
projects' failure to produce a positive outcome. First, CNCA's strategy of credit diversification resulted
in lending huge amounts of funds to large corporate clients in agro-industries and related activities which
ultimately turned out to be non-performing loans. The most recent estimate30 is that out of an outstanding
amount of DH 1.7 billion only DH 250 million were recovered in 1997. The clients that CNCA reached
with this diversification strategy were probably those who were non-bankable according to the current
standards of other Moroccan banks. CNCA's lending diversification strategy damaged its financial
structure. Second, from 1992 to 1997, CNCA's credit commitments declined in terms of constant DH.
More specifically, the cancellation of a substantial portion of the Bank's loan was accompanied by both a
reduction of lending by other cofinanciers and a substantial downscaling of CNCA's own financial
participation to the credit line related program (Table 4, above). This downscaling obscures the
reallocation that CNCA made which consequently imperiled the bank.
43.   Instead of improving, CNCA's institutional strength has deteriorated. The components that were
deemed to be critical for CNCA's strengthening, namely the development and introduction of an
executive decision-making information and management control system using upgraded computers
turned out to be unsuited to CNCA's needs and had to be discontinued. New, more appropriate systems
are currently being designed. It has been demonstrated that the training component was unsuccessful due
to misconceived human resource management. Expected improvements in appraisal and supervision
procedures were compromised by CNCA's management, who bypassed the most basic standards
generally accepted in the banking business. CNCA's governance issues remain unsolved. The
Government has not really decided if this institution should be a Government service or an independent
bank. Therefore, it has been a defacto bank, without having the means of, or implementing the prudential
rules and procedures required in, this business. In any case, the current situation of CNCA is far from
that of an autonomous full-service bank operating within a competitive banking environment. Finally, the
30 Cf. the report prepared by "Evalude", the Bank's consultant (in project files), dated April 14, 1998.

establishment of a Climatic Risk Insurance Fund, which was also a Government responsibility, never
materialized. Since CNCA's current institutional state is not expected to yield worthwhile development
results, the proposed sub-rating for the institutional outcome is highly unsatisfactory.
H.    Future Operations
44.   Currently, the Bank does not contemplate any similar operation in the near future. However, it is
carefully monitoring the evolution of the current situation. It participates, in close relationship with
cofinanciers (AFD, KfW), in discussions concerning a full rehabilitation of CNCA, providing advice on
the reliability and sustainability of measures chosen by Moroccan counterparts. It stands ready to provide
appropriate financial assistance to implement CNCA's institutional restructuring once a credible and
coherent global plan is designed, provided that Moroccan counterparts concretely demonstrate their
commitment to implement such a plan. This is the most realistic attitude.
1.    Key Lessons Learned
45.   The Bank must systematically check that its analytical vigilance is not weakened by long-term
relationships of trust established with its clients. In particular, warning signals issued at various Bank
levels and more specifically by OED must be followed by accurate and appropriate investigations
ensuring that lending operations are soundly based. A similar attitude must prevail as far as the
relationship between the Bank's client and the sub-borrowers is concerned.
46.   Long lasting financial relationships between the Bank and its clients must not give the client the
illusory view that Bank resources are of a permanent nature. This is all the more important since in this
case, Bank funding was designed to attract cofinancing, part of which was, at times, transformed into an
equity allowance. OED had expressed concerns in reports on prior loans that CNCA was heavily
dependent on external sources of funds, but the covenanted debt to equity ratio was nevertheless loosened
from 6:1 (Fifth Project, Loan 2367-MOR) to 8:1 (Sixth Project, Loan 273 1-MOR) to 10:1 (Loans 3088-
MOR and 3662-MOR). The result is that when problems arise, the borrower may blame the lender for
adding to its financial crisis. This explains the Bank's hesitance to consider suspension of disbursements
or loan cancellations.
47.   Sub-loan criteria must be neither neglected nor minimized, whether they are quantitative (FRRs
and ERRs) or qualitative. Careful reviews of the conditions under which the credit line is used and
further supervised by the borrower can detect borrowers' failures or unnecessary risk-taking.
48.   When it comes to designing and monitoring institutional changes that are of a systemic nature,
the Bank should not rely on technical divisions and teams unsuited to the task, whatever their familiarity
and experience with the institution may be. Especially in the banking business where there is a
multiplicity of risks, assessment and subsequent recommendations should be entrusted to diversified
teams of banking specialists. Financial analysts and those who have familiarity and experience with a
given financial institution may then be called as technical advisers. It is also important to renew the teams
periodically in order to bring fresh perspectives and innovative views into projects that, otherwise,
become routine exercises.
49.   Finally, Bank management must review the assertions of project teams and systematically
challenge those assertions. This will ensure that they are reliable and based on solid information.

ROYAUME DU MAROC
SECOND PROJET NATIONAL DE CREDIT AGRICOLE
Mission conjointe de supervision BIRD-CFD-KfW
30 Mars au 03 Avril 1998
AIDE-MEMOIRE
Introduction
I - Une mission conjointe de la Banque Mondiale (BIRD), de la Caisse Francaise de Developpement
(CFD) et de la Kreditanstalt fir Wiederaufbau (KfW), a effectue une supervision du Second Projet de
Cr6dit Agricole du 30 mars au 03 avril 1998. La mission etait composde de Axel Peuker, Victor Agius, et
Christian Bartoli (consultant, expert financier) de la Banque Mondiale, Gilles Chausse, Gerard Ancey,
Bruno Leclerc et Claude Falgon (consultant financement agriculture) de la CFD et Roland Siller de la
KfW. Olivier Godron, Representant resident de la Banque Mondiale, Olivier Beugnot, Directeur de la
CFD au Maroc, et Monique Marquion, de la D6legation de l'Union Europeenne a Rabat, ont participe aux
reunions de synthese.
2 - L'objet principal de la mission etait de faire le point et de donner une appreciation sur le plan de
redressement de la CNCA defini par le Gouvernement en juin 97 et amende en septembre 97, et sur les
mesures de r6organisation interne definies par la nouvelle Direction Gendrale de la CNCA mise en place
en octobre 97. La mission a eu des entretiens avec la Direction Generale et les principaux responsables de
la CNCA a Rabat. Elle a visite a Meknes la Direction du R6seau Ddcentralisee (DRD), ainsi que la Caisse
Locale (CLCA) d'EI Hajeb et la Caisse Rdgionale (CRCA ) de Meknes.
3 - La mission a egalement eu des entretiens avec les autorites de tutelle de la CNCA: le Secretaire
Gen6ral de l'Agriculture, M. Lhafi, le Directeur du Tresor, M. Loudiyi et le Directeur General de Bank A.l
Maghrib, M. Benamour. La mission tient a remercier 1'ensemble des personnes rencontrees, notamment
les responsables de la CNCA, pour 1'excellent accueil et l'assistance efficace qu'elle a regus tout au long
de son sejour au Maroc.
4 - Le pr6sent aide-memoire est provisoire en attendant sa validation par les sieges respertifs des
institutions de financement dont relevent les membres de la mission.



Appendix A
Page 3 of 8
Rappel des recommandations de la mission conjointe BIRD-CFD-KfW
d'avril 97
5 - La mission d'avril 97 avait insiste sur l'urgence. et la gravite de la situation de la CNCA, et estime
qu'un plan de redressement drastique devait 8tre defini et mis en ceuvre pour assurer la survie et le
sauvetage de la banque.
6 - La mission preconisait que ce plan s'articule autour de deux axes principaux:
a) une rehabilitation financiere, comprenant:
a. 1) une recapitalisation par l'Etat de 1.532 MDH,
a.2) le remboursement par I'Etat de sa dette (552 MDH) envers la CNCA,
a.3) le retour aux conventions de base en matiere de risque de change,
a.4) I'adoption d'une politique de developpement et de facturation des services,
a.5) l'intensification des actions de collecte de l'epargne,
a.6) une diversification saine et prudente des activit6s.
b) une rehabilitation institutionnelle, comprenant:
b. 1) un chantier institutionnel, avec notamment:
* I'adoption d'un nouveau statut,
* une redefinition des tAches au sein de la CNCA,
* une reorganisation et un renforcement du reseau,
* une reforme du statut du personnel.
b.2) un chantier fonctionnel, avec notamment:
- la creation d'une direction des operations bancaires,
- la mise en place d'une informatique performante, tant au siege qu'en agence,
- la revision de l'ensemble des chaines de traitement.
b.3) un chantier op6rationnel, visant notamment:
- I'arret des h6morragies financieres,
- la poursuite et 'intensification des efforts de recouvrement, en particulier sur les
quelque 50 principaux d6biteurs,
* I'amelioration du Produit Net Bancaire (augmentation des ressources et baisse des
frais generaux),
* Ia poursuite des efforts en matiere de formation.
Ce constat avait ete globalement avalise par les autorites gouvernementales.
7 - A la suite de cette mission, un plan de redressement a et defini par le Gouvernement en juin 1997 et
presente a la Banque Mondiale A Washington en juillet 1997. Suite aux fortes objections emises par la
Banque Mondiale, ce plan a ete legerement modifi6 et des mesures de consolidation des dettes des
agriculteurs ont et annoncees et lancees en septembre 97. Les bailleurs de fonds emettent les plus
grandes reserves sur ce plan, en particulier sur le reechelonnement generalis des creances
agricoles, contraire aux recommandations de la mission conjointe d'avril 97.
8 - Par ailleurs un nouveau Directeur General a et nomme en octobre 97, qui a presente les premieres
mesures de reorganisation interne fin decembre 97 a la KfW a Frankfort et a la CFD A Paris. II a ete pr6vu
alors la venue d'une mission conjointe des bailleurs de fonds fin mars 1998.



Appendix A
Page 4 of 8
Situation actuelle
9 - La mission a pu constater que la mise en oeuvre des recommandations de la mission conjointe d'avril
97 avait atteint des niveaux variables d'execution.
10 - Au niveau de la CNCA, les mesures d'urgence engag&es par la nouvelle Direction Generale
install6e en octobre 97 vont dans le bon sens. La mission emet un avis positif sur les decisions prises
ces derniers mois par la CNCA pour reorganiser la banque et redynamiser le reseau, mais note que
sa strategie de developpement pour le moyen et long terme reste A finaliser. De plus, il reste ai
obtenir des resultats significatifs sur les actions de recouvrement aupres des principaux debiteurs.
11 - Il a 6te constate que le changement des responsables intervenu au niveau de la Direction G6nerale de
la CNCA avait fortement contribu6 a ameliorer son "professionnalisme", comme la mission d'avril 97
I'avait suggere. D'importantes decisions internes A la CNCA ont 0t6 prises, concernant en particulier:
* I'adoption par la CNCA d'un positionnement de "banque rurale de proximite",
* Ia reorganisation et la revalorisation du reseau, avec la mise en place des Directions de R6seau
Decentralisees aux pouvoirs et responsabilites plus etendus,
* la r6organisation de la chaine de credit pour une securisation renforcee des engagements,
* Ia refonte de l'organigramme et la red6finition des taches de chaque direction et departement,
* Ia creation d'un departement "organisation" et celle, imminente, d'une Direction des
Operations Bancaires,
* la defnition d'une politique commerciale plus agressive, ax6e sur les "gros clients" et la
collecte des dep6ts,
 I'adoption de mesures visant a ameliorer le Produit Net Bancaire (facturation des services,
objectif "gros clients", diminution du cofit des ressources, volonte de limiter les frais
generaux, etc...).
* la realisation d'un diagnostic des ressources humaines, instrument de base pour la future prise
de d6cisions dans ce domaine sensible,
* I'adoption d'une demarche pragmatique en matiere d'informatique, avec la decision de
s'orienter au niveau central vers un progiciel bancaire int6gre comme l'avait recommande la
mission d'avril 97,
* Ia decision d'annuler les interets des petits credits octroyes avant le 31 d6cembre 1989.
12 - Neanmoins, prise par l'urgence, la nouvelle Direction Generale a dui parer au plus presse, mais n'a
pas encore pu finaliser la reflexion sur sa strategie et son plan d'actions a moyen et long terme. La
mission estime que les points suivants, concernant le financement de I'agriculture, devraient etre
approfondis:
* segmentation du marche, en integrant les resultats du recensement general de l'agriculture,
definition des methodologies d'octroi de credit et d'objectifs adaptes a chacun des
segments du march6,
* financement de l'agriculture non solvable : en accord avec le Gouvernement (voir point 15),
la CNCA devrait jouer un r6le cle dans la reflexion sur le financement de l'agriculture non
solvable, d'autant plus que cette activite influe aussi bien sur l'implantation de la CNCA sur le
terrain que sur ses perspectives financieres. La definition precise du role de la CNCA sur le
financement de l'agriculture non solvable devrait etre le cceur de la convention CNCA / Etat a
preparer et valider,
* assurance du credit agricole: la mission considere que l'echec de l'operation assurance
agricole menee depuis 3 ans par le Ministere de l'Agriculture doit inciter la CNCA a etre plus

active sur ce dossier, en concertation etroite avec le secteur prive de I'assurance et les
Ministeres de l'Agriculture et des Finances, et en repartant des conclusions de l'atelier de mai
1995 qui avaient fait l'objet d'un consensus.
13 - La situation financiere s'est encore degradee en 1997. La perte de l'exercice est de 268 MDH,
dont 40 MDH dfis A la remise en cause par l'Etat des accords passes en matiere de risque de change. Les
octrois de credit ont r6gresse de 27% par rapport a I'annee precedente. Le Produit Net Bancaire a diminue
de 15% par rapport a 1996. Les charges de personnel continuent a peser lourdement sur les couts
d'exploitation de la banque. Elles constituent 80% des charges de fonctionnement. L'insuffisance de
provisions, evaluee a 1.200 MDH, ne pourra pas 8tre resorbee par les resultats futurs.
Les fonds propres amputds des pertes passent de 1.416 MDH a fin 96, a 1.188 MDH a fin 97. En tenant
compte de l'insuffisance de provisions, la situation nette est negative. En matiere de recouvrement, les
resultats obtenus sont extremement faibles, notamment en ce qui concerne les creances du secteur non-
agricole concentrees sur moins de cinquante clients et qui representent a elles seules un encours au
31.12.97 de 1.841 MDH et un impaye de 1.317 MDH. La dette du Tr6sor envers la CNCA n'a pas et
entierement resorbee. Compte tenu des nouveaux engagements contractes dans 1'exercice, elle s'616ve
encore a 585 MDH a fin decembre 97.
14 - Au vu du constat de la degradation de la situation financiere a fin 1997, il apparai^t que la
recapitalisation pr6vue de 250 MDH est largement insuffisante pour assainir la banque etant donne
1'etat sinistre de son portefeuille. La mission estime donc indispensable de reconsiderer le plan de
restructuration de juin 1997, y compris en recherchant des solutions innovantes destinees a assainir
la banque de facon definitive.
15 - Au niveau de l'Etat, la mission note qu'un effort a e  fait pour regler les arri6r6s vis a vis de la
CNCA. Cependant, les autres mesures prevues ne repondent pas a la gravit6 de la situation:
3 Le retour aux conventions de base en matifre de couverture de risque de change n'a pas
e  concretise officiellement, alors qu'il etait explicitement prevu dans le plan de
restructuration de juin 97. Ce retour serait meme remis en cause par le Ministere des
Finances, en contradiction avec les conventions sign6es avec les bailleurs de fonds,
* l'Etat n'a pas encore finalise la reflexion de fond sur le financement de I'agriculture. Le
choix de l'orientation "banque rurale de proximite" a ete confirme par la CNCA. Ceci conduit
naturellement la CNCA A octroyer des credits A la fraction de l'agriculture solvable, option que
la mission approuve. Il reste cependant A trouver des solutions appropriees pour la fraction de
I'agriculture difficilement bancable,
* P'operation de reechelonnement, decidee par le Gouvernement en septembre 97 et terminne
au 28 f6vrier 98, correspond a un effort financier important de r'Etat (950 MDH en 10 ans)
pour bonifier cette consolidation, et part du principe louable de reduire le surendettement des
agriculteurs. Elle presente neanmoins des effets pervers:
* elle a davantage touchd les gros et moyens agriculteurs, et n'a donc pas regld le
probleme du surendettement des petits agriculteurs,
* les bons clients de la CNCA, qui n'avaient pas d'arrieres, ont pu en b6neficier,
* surtout, elle correspond a un nettoyage "de fa9ade" qui ne fait que decaler le probleme
dans le temps.



Appendix .A
Page 6 of 8
La mission estime qutil conviendrait d'utiliser de facon plus efficace 1'enveloppe de 950 1ADH
d6gagee par l'Etat. Cette enveloppe pourrait par exemple etre partiellement canalisee vers une
structure de cantonnement A creer, qui serait clairement separee des activites "saines" de la
CNCA, et aurait vocation A recueillir la plus grande partie des prets douteux reechelonn6s.
Une prise en charge non equivoque de ces creances douteuses par l'Etat (bonification d'int6rets
de reechelonnement et eventuellement solde A recouvrer) pourrait des lors justifier, sous
reserve d'un examen plus detaille, une reprise partielle des provisions existantes et une
amelioration correspondante de la structure bilantielle de la CNCA "assainie".
* Le projet de statut n'a pas encore 6te approuve. Des discussions se poursuivent sur le
nouveau statut. Sur les deux principaux enjeux du projet de statut, la position de la missicon se
resume ainsi:
* transformation de la CNCA en socidtd anonyme de droit commun: la mission appuie
cette proposition, qui permettra de clarifier les responsabilites entre l'Etat et la CNCA
et de disposer d'un veritable Conseil d'Administration. La mission exprime cependant
ses plus grandes reserves sur la proposition de cr6er un Comite Directeur compose de
representants de l'Administration externes a la CNCA. La mission considere que cette
mesure est en contradiction avec l'autonomie et la responsabilisation souhaitees de la
CNCA,
* creation de Banques Regionales: la mission estime que la situation n'est pas mure
actuellement pour la creation de banques regionales, tant qu'il n'est pas acquis qu'elles
peuvent etre viables financierement (point lui meme lie aux d6cisions sur le
financement de la petite agriculture).
Recommandations
16 - D'une fa9on g6n6rale, la mission a constat6 avec satisfaction les efforts de reorganisation
engages en interne par la nouvelle Direction Generale. Elle considere neanmoins que le
redressement financier de la CNCA est loin d'8tre acquis et que ces efforts ne porteront
v6ritablement leurs fruits que slils sont accompagnes par une forte volonte politique au niveau Ide
l'Etat et par des decisions precises et urgentes sur le redressement financier et sur la clarification
du role de la CNCA dans le financement de l'agriculture.
La mission recommande donc que les mesures suivantes soient prises:
17 - am niveau de la CNCA : la preparation d'un plan d'actions global, avec des indicateurs de suivi et
un calendrier, qui devrait etre presente au Conseil d'Administration de la CNCA. Ce plan devrait
comprendre:
* un plan de redressement financier sur 5 ans, etabli sur des bases volontaristes mais
prudentes, permettant a la CNCA de respecter au terme du plan les regles prudentielles
en vigueur. Le plan precisera les divers scenarios possibles pour la restructuration du bilan de
la CNCA (recapitalisation complementaire, mise en place d'une structure de cantonnement, ...)
et tiendra compte en particulier de la tombee des premieres echeances des credits reechelonnes
de septembre 1997 A fevrier 1998,



Appendix A
Page 7 of 8
* Ia poursuite des efforts engages en termes d'organisation, de redressement interne et de
professionnalisme A tous les niveaux de la banque, avec une priorite A accorder A court terme a
la mise en place de nouvelles procedures de contr6le et d'un systeme informatique performant,
* le prolongement et l'intensification des actions en cours, par la nouvelle cellule specialis6e
que vient de cr6er la CNCA, visant le recouvrement des impayes des principaux d6biteurs
non agricoles (88 dossiers), ce qui constitue toujours aux yeux de la mission une priorite
absolue. Compte tenu de l'importance du dossier pour la situation financiere de la CNCA, des
recommandations rep6t6es des bailleurs de fonds depuis plusieurs annees et des faibles
resultats obtenus a ce jour, la mission demande qu'un audit externe soit commande par la
CNCA, dont les termes de reference seront communiques aux bailleurs de fonds.
* I'elaboration d'une proposition sur le financement de l'agriculture dans son ensemble, et sur
le r6le de la CNCA dans cette problematique, afin de participer de maniere active aux
discussions de fond avec la nouvelle equipe gouvernementale,
* la relance du dossier relatif A l'assurance du credit agricole, lie A la reflexion precedente, en
collaboration avec le Gouvernement sur la base des recommandations etablies en 1995.
18 - au niveau du gouvernement:
* la participation active a la restructuration et au redressement financier de la CNCA,
avec notamment:
* le retour aux conventions de base en matiere de couverture de risque de change,
* I'apurement des arrieres de l'Etat,
* le versement des 250 MDH de recapitalisation deja accordes,
* l'utilisation optimale de 1'enveloppe de 950 MDH prevue par le plan de restructuration
de juin 1997, et des apports financiers supplementaires, si n6cessaires, a d6finir lors de
1'6tablissement du plan d'assainissement financier,
* la recherche de montages financiers innovants, de type structure de cantonnement,
pour assainir la CNCA de facon definitive,
 un soutien actif des autorites politiques et judiciaires pour le recouvrement, en particulier
des principaux debiteurs,
* des decisions sur le financement de I'agriculture, afin de clarifier rapidement les r6les
respectifs de la CNCA et de l'Etat, A formaliser dans une convention particuliere,
* ia reprise du dossier relatif a l'assurance agricole, sur la base du consensus de 1995, afin
d'engager des actions sur de nouvelles bases saines et viables,
* Ia reformulation et la validation du projet du nouveau statut de la CNCA. La mission
recommande de transformer la CNCA en Societe Anonyme, mais de surseoir pour le moment
a la creation de Banques Regionales autonomes. La mission approuve le principe d'un
veritable Conseil d'Administration, mais desapprouve l'idee de la creation d'un Comite
Directeur compose de representants de 1Administration externes A la CNCA.
19 - au niveau de Bank Al Maghrib
* communication aux bailleurs de fonds de I'audit du portefeuille de la CNCA initie mi 97,
* surveillance toute particuliere de la CNCA dans cette periode difficile, tant du point de
vue des procedures que des ratios prudentiels,
* appui a la d6finition et a la mise en ceuvre des mesures de redressement financier de la
CNCA evoquees ci-dessus.
20 - La mission recommande qu'un appui technique specifique puisse 8tre apport6 a la CNCA pour ce
qui concerne:



Appendix A
Page 8 of 8
* le plan de redressement financier, notamment sur la reflexion relative a la cr6ation d'une
structure de cantonnement,
* la methodologie d'elaboration de la segmentation des marches de la CNCA et de leur
financement.
Les bailleurs de fonds examineront la possibilite de financer ces missions d'appui.
21 - D'une faeon plus gin6rale, et en dehors de ces deux points specifiques, la mission confirme que
de nouveaux appuis A la CNCA par les bailleurs de fonds seront examines a la lumiere des progres
qui seront realises.
Points specifiques
22 - La CNCA a approche la delegation de la Banque Mondiale pour le paiement anticipe / accelere de
deux pr8ts. La d6legation a avis6 la CNCA des etapes necessaires au niveau de son siege pour permettre
I'aboutissement de cette requete.
23 - La delegation de la Banque Mondiale a egalement informe la CNCA de la necessite de preparer un
rapport d'execution et d'achevement du projet national de credit agricole dans les six mois qui suivront la
cl6ture du projet effective au 30 mars 1998.

WORLD BANK LOAN NO. 3662-MOR
(EIGHTH LINE OF CREDIT)
Under the Second National Agricultural Credit Project, CNCA received a loan from the
World Bank in the amount of US$100 million.
The Loan Agreement was signed on December 13, 1993 and was made effective on
February 18, 1994.
1.    Loan provisions
The loan was granted for a period of 20 years, with a 5-year grace period.
The interest rate, to vary semi-annually, was set at the cost of World Bank qualified
borrowings plus a margin of 0.5%. The rate fluctuated between 7.27% (1994) and 6.70%
(December 31, 1997).
In 1991, the World Bank began to extend interest rebates to borrowers meeting their loan
obligations on schedule.
CNCA has therefore benefited from an interest rate discount of 0.25%.
The commitment charge, established contractually at 0.75%, was actually paid at 0.25%,
reflecting the provisions introduced by the World Bank in April 1991.
Installments are payable semi-annually, on March 15h and September 15' of each year.
The initial installment of principal is due on March 15, 1999, and the final one on
September 15, 2013.
The Project was originally to have been implemented over a four-year period, from
January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1997, and the closing date was scheduled for March 31, 1998.
Difficult economic and financial circumstances delayed disbursements until February and March
1996, with onlending retroactive to April 1, 1993.
2.    Utilization of loan proceeds
Upon signature of the loan, the amounts allocated and the sub-loan percentages for each
category were as follows:
* Category 1 (a): Greenhouses - US$10 million; sub-loans, 75%.
. Category 1 (b): Other agricultural investments (regional agricultural credit banks and
headquarters) - US$45 million; sub-loans, 40%.
* Category 2 (a): Agro-industries - US$15 million; sub-loans, 50%.

However, the overall amount initially allocated was amended substantially, as were the
arnounts for each category and some onlending rates (see Annex I).
CNCA actually prepared the Second National Agricultural Credit Project in February
1992, during a period of drought. It theorized that rainfall would return to normal levels during
the 1993 crop year and that CNCA disbursements would therefore approximate those paid out in
1991 and rise significantly starting in 1993.
These working assumptions did not materialize, since widespread drought persisted in
1993, 1995, and, to a lesser degree, 1997. Moreover, even though 1994 and 1996 were good
crop years, agricultural investment did not increase significantly, since it was impossible for the
sector to compensate in the course of a single year for shortages extending over several
successive years of drought.
Accordingly, climatic conditions and the financial difficulties farmers faced as a result -
characterized by severe and rising indebtedness - did not augur well for increased sector activity
during the life of the Project.
Furthermore, in 1991 the monetary authorities introduced a new method for covering
foreign exchange risk in respect of external loans contracted by CNCA after May 30,
199 13I.This method required payment of an excessive interest differential to the Treasury32. As
a result, CNCA assumed the entire foreign exchange risk for World Bank loan No. 3662-MOR.
It was therefore necessary to reduce the line of credit so that CNCA would be able to absorb any
latent attendant foreign exchange risk
In addition, following the April 1994 reform, given the base lending rate (BLR) and the
decline in loan interest rates spurred by competition and encouraged by the Government, CNCA
had to  contend  with  interest rate risk.   Its spread  declined  substantially  during project
implementation, a factor that discouraged borrowing dependent on costly resources. Moreover,
31    Ministry of Finance letter No. 3/9904 dated May 30, 1998 called for payment to the Treasury of an interest differential
for partial coverage of foreign exchange losses incurred in connection with foreign loans, calculated on the basis of the
difference between a reference rate and the contractual rate of the loan, thereby neutralizing CNCA's margin.
32    The impact was such that in November 1996, the Ministry of Finance determined that CNCA should absorb an
additional 20% of gross foreign exchange losses incurred since January 1, 1996 in connection with foreign loare
enjoying government protection from the attendant exchange risk.

CNCA was able to access domestic money market funds on highly favorable terms since, for the
samne reasons, and following money market reforns introduced in May, 1995, the market was
highly liquid and interest rates were very attractive.
Furthermore, in addition to concessional loans from OECF and FADES - the cost of
which cut less sharply into CNCA's spread - onlending for the Second National Agricultural
Credit Project included a line of credit from KfW in the amount of DM 54.4 million to the
Moroccan Treasury for capitalization of CNCA and a grant of ECU 16 million from the
European Union to strengthen the capital position of local banks. Onlending for CNCA
operations was accorded priority given the contractual deadlines for utilization of those funds.
For all these reasons, CNCA delayed utilizing World Bank resources, requested a
reduction in line of credit No. 3662-MOR, and ultimately used only some of those funds.
As of March 31, 1998, the closing date of the line of credit, total withdrawals amounted
to US$21,005,282.38, or DH 179,332,314.14 (see Annex II). This amount paid for operations
during the period April 1, 1993-March 31, 1994, and was released to CNCA in two tranches, on
February 23 and March 1, 1996.
[TN33]Actual withdrawals represented 21% of the initial line of credit, which was
reduced to US$50 million on September 30, 199634 and then to US$25,005,282.38 on October
7, 199735 leaving the remainder - US$4 million - for institutional support. On January 19, 1998
CNCA informed the World Bank that it would be unable to implement an institutional support
program by the loan closing date with the balance of line of credit No. 3662-MOR, and
expressed the hope that the closing would not be extended, so that it would not continue to be
liable for the commitment charge.
The final utilization rate of this line of credit was 84%.
The loan was used to provide financing to 2,934 clients, who thus benefited from
operations totaling DH 378,330,751.52 (see Annex III).
3.    Observations
3.1. Project objectives
33   [N: Original French text provides no footnote No. 3.]
34   The World Bank notified CNCA of the approved cancellation of US$50 million by telex on October 29, 1996, in reply
to CNCA's request of September 10, 1996 (No. 4012/DRFI-RES/DIV).
35   The World Bank notified CNCA of the cancellation of US$24,994,717.62 by telex on October 29, 1997, in reply to
CNCA's request of September 24, 1997 (No. 416/97/DG).

Notwithstanding the difficult circumstances described above and the relatively high cost
of World Bank resources, CNCA, pursuant to Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement dated
December 13, 1993, did its utmost to accomplish the project objectives, particularly those
relating to development of the agricultural, agro-exporter, and coastal fisheries sectors, and of
rural areas in general. CNCA therefore granted sub-loans in accordance with appropriate
technical, financial, economic, and administrative practices and provided, as needed, the funds
and services required for that purpose. It conducted all its operations with all possible diligence
and efficiency, with qualified management and personnel, and in accordance with its legislation,
its general policy, and its credit guidelines.
Furthermore, the sub-loans were granted in accordance with the procedures and terms and
conditions set out in Schedule 5 of the Loan Agreement of December 13, 1993.
The loan objectives also called for development of CNCA's banking operations and for
its institutional strengthening. It may be noted in this connection that, in order to address its
financial and institutional situation, CNCA initiated a restructuring exercise toward the end of
1995 which led to the preparation and implementation of two successive adjustment plans.
The first of these, prepared in December 1995, covered a three-year period and included
three components:
* rebalancing of CNCA's financial structure through establishment of a guarantee fund and
strengthening of its own-funds position;
* recovery of bad debts;
* acceleration of the settlement procedure for Treasury payments due to CNCA.
However, early in 1997 it became apparent that this initial plan could not succeed, since it
was based essentially on an overly optimistic forecast of CNCA's earning capacity.
Accordingly, a new CNCA recovery plan was finalized in late 1997. Its objective was to
endow CNCA with a structure better adapted to the competitive environment in which it
operated, while respecting its mission as a public-service entity.
The broad outlines of the plan focused on recapitalization, measures to address farmers'
excessive indebtedness, and ways to strengthen CNCA's management capacity.
With regard to recapitalization, the Moroccan Government provided CNCA with DH 250
million, to be disbursed during FY98, and made a serious effort to settle Treasury arrears.
With regard to the excessive indebtedness of small farmers, it was decided to reschedule
farmers' outstanding debts, with interest subsidies, over a maximum of ten years. The cost of the
subsidy - totaling DH 950 million -would be funded from the national budget. Additional
measures called for cancellation of farm credit interest and collection fees for loans under DH
200,000 disbursed prior to December 31, 1989.



Appendix B

With regard to the strengthening of CNCA's management capacity, the first task was to
redefine the institution's role and strategy. With this in mind, a study on financing for small
farmers suggested a number of strategic options. The selected option calls for community banks
to be the primary suppliers of agricultural, agro-industrial, and rural development credit, and for
them to have the legal status of corporations and performing a public service mission under
agreements with the Government.
The rehabilitation plan also calls for upgrading CNCA by:
*  restoring profitability by increasing net bank income and rationalizing general expenses;
*  introducing credit risk controls by consolidating outstanding debt gradually and establishing
a new credit disbursement facility;
* ensuring financial soundness by optimizing external financing costs and developing the client
base; and
*  streamlining operations through audits of unprofitable locations, development of an efficient
information system, effective and focused human resources management, and expenditure
controls.
Planned supporting measures will focus on:
*  creating. a more effective institution by restructuring its organization chart, introducing a
rigorous claims monitoring system, reorganizing back offices, and easing the administrative
burden throughout the CNCA network;
*  overhauling the network's organizational structure by decentralizing responsibilities, thus
encouraging greater responsiveness and improved network management;
X  adopting a marketing plan to foster a better understanding of clients and the environment in
which they operate, thereby positioning CNCA to take steps affecting product supply and
distribution channels;
* finalizing information systems to facilitate effective day-to-day operations, internal control,
and forecasting;
*  introducing the requisite procedures and an appropriate monitoring system to ensure
improved operations and effective decentralization;
* adapting its human resources to the requirements of a modern bank by devising staffing
guidelines that reflect a closer correlation between staff profiles and job descriptions,
defining requirements and rules with respect to management, introducing a new performaince
evaluation system, and promoting internal communication among staff members.
A number of steps have been taken to achieve these objectives:
*  The range of products and services has been diversified further following the redefinition of
CNCA's banking functions and the development of a commercial policy;
*  To improve net bank income, measures were introduced to address interest rates and service
charges, and to promote the recovery of large companies in the agro-industrial sector;



Appendix B
Page 7 of 18
*  To control operating expenses, certain expenditures were consolidated and rationalized,
inventory control was enhanced, and a number of buildings considered redundant were sold;
*  The organization chart was revised (see Annex IV), thereby reshaping CNCA into
homogenous units and establishing Decentralized Network Departments endowed with major
responsibilities;
*  With regard to human resources, attention focused in particular on staff development, more
equitable distribution of year-end bonuses, establishment of a human resources committee to
prepare vocational assessments and encourage improved matching of workers with jobs, and
development of internal communications better targeted to users.
3.2    General conditions
Broadly speaking, the general conditions relating to CNCA's obligations toward the
World Bank under Loan Agreement No. 3662-MOR were met.
Pursuant to Section 4.01 of the Agreement, CNCA maintained records and accounts
adequate to reflect its operations and financial condition in accordance with sound accounting
practices. In particular, in 1996 CNCA began to apply the Central Bank's rules governing loan
loss classification and provisioning. CNCA was thus able to negotiate a reasonable period of
time for full implementation of the rules established by the Bank Al Maghrib.
CNCA also had its records, accounts, and financial statements audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the World Bank, and provided the World Bank with copies of its financial
statements and the report of its auditors.
Pursuant to Section 4.02, CNCA utilized all amounts received from beneficiaries in
payment of interest or repayment of principal under sub-loans to finance the development of the
agricultural and rural sectors, in accordance with its credit policy guidelines.
Pursuant to Section 4.03 of the Agreement, CNCA took all such actions as were
necessary to protect itself against foreign exchange risk, in particular, by prepaying more costly
lines of credit and relying on the interbank market for maturity matching purposes.
3.3   Financial conditions
In accordance with Section 4.04, CNCA ensured that the weighted average of rates at
which interest and other fees on loans made was equal at least to the rate of change in the
producer price index.
WITH REGARD TO THE MINIMUM FINANCIAL STANDARDS REQUIRED TO BE OBSERVED DURING THE LIFE
OF THE PROJECT, IN PARTICULAR THOSE CONCERNING CAPITAL ADEQUACY, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL
PROFITABILITY, AND DEBT (SEE SECTIONS 4.04 AND 4.06), THE READER IS REFERRED TO THE VARIOUS
GENERAL AND ANNUAL AUDIT REPORTS TRANSMITTED TO THE WORLD BANK, AS WELL AS TO THE AIDE-
MEMOIRES OF JOINT DONOR MISSIONS FOR THE SAME PERIOD, SINCE THESE DOCUMENTS ADDRESS ALL
THESE MATTERS FULLY.
