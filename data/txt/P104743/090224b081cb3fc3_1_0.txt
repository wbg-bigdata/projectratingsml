                         progress has been made towards achieving the first two project objectives, namely, to support the implementation of the National Pension Act and to strengthen institutional capacity
                         of key agencies responsible for implementing the National Pension Act. This is evident from progress made against relevant project outcome and intermediate outcome indicators
                         with a number of targets already met in advance of schedule. Regrettably, progress against the third objective - to develop the processes and platforms required for the delivery of
                         social protection programs - is lagging although there has been increasing progress in implementation during the past four months. The MTR has confirmed that the project is

                         expected to meet its objectives by the Closing Date of June 30, 2015. Of the total credit/grant amount of US$15.8 million, US$ 6.8 million has been disbursed, with additional US$2.0
                         million committed. The MTR reviewed the indicators and targets for the project (including the disbursement linked indicators or DLI matrix) and has recommended that some
                         adjustments be made to more correctly reflect progress made and planned implementation of the project. These changes will be reflected through project restructuring expected to
                         be finalized by July 2013 and will be reported on in the next ISR.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The MTR has recommended a revision of the Results Framework and two DLI targets in order to reflect changed priorities and the implementation reality. These revisions were
                         discussed with the Government and would be reflected in project restructuring and by amending the Financing Agreement.

                         At the request of NSPA, the project will no longer finance the design and development of the new national ID system. The upcoming project restructuring will remove the technical
                         advisory services to strengthen the national identification system from the Component D, which was added during the 2012 project restructuring.
