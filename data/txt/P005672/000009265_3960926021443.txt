MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A HIGHWAYS MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan for the
equivalent of US$63 million to the Republic of Tunisia is submitted for approval.
The pjroposed loan would help finance a Highways Maintenance and Rehabilitation
Project and would have a term of seventeen years, including 4 years of grace, at
the standard variable interest rate.
2.       Background.  Tunisia's transport infrastructure includes five major ports,
about 1,900 km of railway lines, some 9,000 and 28,000 km of paved and unpaved
roads respectively, and four international airports. Traffic has increased by
about 8% per annum since 1970 for both freight and passengers with a marked shift
from railways to road transport. Since 1970, the railway share of main line
traffic passengers has declined from 17% to 6X, and its share of freight from 37Z
to 13X, with phosphate rock transport accounting for about two thirds of total
freight. The relatively small size of the country and the concentraticxi of
economic activity in the Northeast have contributed to this decline. Port traffic
now handles about 15 million tons, and domestic coastal shipping accounts for about
30% of total port traffic, primarily of petroleum products. Roads are now the
dominant transport mode carrying more than 902 of passenger traffic, and almost 70%
of freight, and traffic demand is increasing steadily. Overall, the transport
sector does not constitute a bottleneck for economic and social development in the
sense that important links are missing, or that demand far outweighs supply. In
the past the transport system has served Tunisia's development process well, but as
a large proportion of the network, especially the roads and railways, was built
prior to independence (1956), the system no longer responds to actual traffic
patterns and volumes.
3.       The main issue in sector management is the lack of institutional
responsibility for planning covering the whole sec.or. Planning, construction and
operation of road infrastructure are managed by the Ministry of Public Works and
Housing (HER), and the remainder of the sector is managed by the Ministry of
Transport (MT). This affected particularly the coordination between road and rail
transport. Weaknesses in planning and management, the importance of the resources
devoted to railways with doubtful economic justification, and the consequent
serious deficits affecting the whole sector were brought to Government attLation in
a Bank Transport Sector Memorandum (1985), and in a recent analysis of the railways
investment program in preparation of the Seventh Plan (1987-1991). This analysis
will be followed by a more comprehensive review of railways for a possible future
transport operation. A Transport Planning and Coordination Unit, established under
the on-going Fourth Highway Project is now operating within the Planning
Directorate of MT, with a special focus on modal coordination. This Unit has
already played a positive role, particularly in the preparation of the Seventh Plan.
4.       Because of the past emphasis on expansion and upgrading of the transport
network, road maintenance and rehabilitation seriously lagged behind during the
latter part of the 1970s. An increasing portion of roads deteriorated below the
standard required by the rapidly increasing traffic volumes. In addition, a



dc"etntralization process initiated in 1981 contributed to lowering the efficiency
_s road maintenance operations as the new Regional Directorates were not geared up
for the task, and received inadequate support from central departments. In the
context of its general stabilization and adjustment policy, the Government's
objectives in the transport sector are to reduce public investments, and make the
most efficient use of existing resourc4s by emphasizing maintenance and
rehabilitation. The proposed project will support these objectives by focusing on
highways maintenance and rehabilitation.
5.       Rationale for IBRD Involvement.  To assist the Government in achieving its
objectives in the transport sector, the Bank has participated in nine transport
projects since 1964. These included five highway projects, one railway project and
three port projects. As a whole, the projects have supported the Bank's main
concern in the sector, namely to modernize and rehabilitate existing
infrastructure, to improve transport operations and to strengthen institutions. ln
the highway sector, the Fourth Highway Project has been successful in
re-establishing a road rehabilitation program as well as strengthening road
maintenance orerations over the whole network. At the same time, balanced
development of the network is being encouraged through the Third and Fifth Highway
Projects, which together support a nationwide program of improvements to cover
2,000 km of rural roads combined with selected complementary agricultural
investments in the areas served. The proposed Maintenance and Rehabilitation
Highway Project is important for ensuring continuity of the long-term efforts
currently underway.
6.       Project Objectives.  The principal objectives of the project are to
support the Government's policy to rationalize highway investments and to seek a
more efficient use of resources, mainly through improved planning and management.
Specifically the project aims at: (a) improving the efficiency of road maintenance
through organization changes and institutional measures within the Highway
Department (DGPC); (b) achieving a proper balance in highway expenditures between
maintenanc3, rehabilitation and new construction;  (c) red- ing the backlog of road
rehabilitation; and (d) improving personnel management and training through the
implementation of an important human resources development program.
7.       Project Description.  To achieve these objectives, the proposed project
comprises: (a) a five-year routine and periodic maintenance program including
procurement of maintenance equipment, and workshop and laboratory facilities and
equipment (including vehicle weighing equipment);  (b) a five-year program of road
rehabilitation covering about 800 km of roads; (c) improvement of the human
resources management system including the establishment of a training directora 3,
the preparation and implementation of a five year training plan, and fellowships
for overseas training; and (d) institutional development (in addition to
strengthening the training function of DGPC) and studies for: (i) establishing an
organization and methods unit; (ii) improving mechanical equipment maintenance;
(iii) reinforcing laboratory services; (iv) economic studies and detailed
engineering for implementing the rehabilitation program.  The project, to be
carried out over 7 years, provides funds for civil works, equipment, technical
assistance and training. The total cost is estimated at US$232.3 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$95.5 million (41X). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Details on
procurement and disbursement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank group operations in Tunisia are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 6247a-TUN dated November 19, 1987 is also attached.



8.       Agreed Actions.  The Governement has agreed on the following actions:
(a) carrying out the project in accordance with the agreed five-year Action Plan;
(b) preparation of technical and economic appraisal reports for each road
rehabilitation sulproject, and their submission to the Bank for prior approval; and
(c) joint review and monitoring: the Government would make available to the Bank
for review and comments by August 15th of each year, beginning in 1988, the annual
programs for the roads subsector, including the maintenance, rehabilitation and
training programs and the proposed budgetary allocations for the following year
covering both capital and recurrent costs; and the Government would no later than
February 15th of each year, starting in 1989, carry out with the Bank an updating
review of the programs to be executed during the same year and of the associated
budgetary allocations.
9.       Additional conditions for Loan effectiveness include:  (a) establishment
of the Training Directorate and appointment of its director; (b) establishment of
a Training Steering Committee; and (c) establishment of the Road Maintenance
Organization and Methods Unit and appointment of its head.
10.      Benefits.  The main quantifiable benefitt. from improved road
rehabilitation and maintenance are reduced vehicle operating costs benefitting all
road transport users. Other benefits would be savings for the Gcvernment in
avoiding frequent road construction, and increased availability and more efficient
use of both human resources and maintenance equipment. In addition, the economy
will benefit from reduced accidents and travel time savings. Economic analyses
taking into account only vehicle operating cost savings over 15 years, show an
economic rate of return (ERR) varying between 30 and 100% for the rehabilitation
program for most road sections; and ranging from 28 to 48% for the maintenance
program.
11.      Risks.  The economic analysis assumes that all the measures foreseen for
the improved maintenance program will be taken in a timely manner so that
efficiency increases are achieved. The key factor to achieve this is the timely
availability of necessary funds. This is especially important for the maintenance
activities. Delays to the road rehabilitation program would result in a
substantial loss of benefits during the period of delay. The high priority
accorded by the Government to the project together with the special institution
building, expenditure forecast, budgeting and monitoring procedures included in tiz
project should reduce the risk of insufficient funds.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed TLoan would comply with
the Articles of A-reement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed Loan.
