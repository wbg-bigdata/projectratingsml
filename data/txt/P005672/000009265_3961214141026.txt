REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
HIGHWAYS MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT (2896-TUN)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report for the Highways Maintenance and Re-
habilitation Project in the Republic of Tunisia, for which Loan 2896-TUN in the amount
of $ 63 million was approved on December 17, 1987, made effective on October 17, 1988
and closed on June 30, 1995. The remaining undisbursed balance of $ 1,212,525.95 was
canceled on November 6, 1995. Final disbursement took place on March 27, 1996 when
the Government reimbursed the Bank $ 589.25, the outstanding balance of the Special
Account, which was canceled from the loan the same day.
The report was prepared by Jaffar Bentchikou (Sr. Highway Engineer), MN1PI and re-
viewed by Amir Al-Khafaji, Division Chief, MN1PI and Rene Costa, Projects Advisor,
MNI. Preparation of this report began during the November 29 to December 14, 1995
mission. Findings were discussed with the Borrower during the March 11 to 20, 1996
mission. Comments on the report have been received from the staff that appraised the op-
eration. The Borrower did not comment in writing on the draft report but has nevertheless
issued its own evaluation (second appendix).






REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
HIGHWAYS MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT (2896-TUN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
1.    The project was the sixth Bank-financed highway project and the eleventh in the
transport sector in Tunisia. A subsequent Rural Roads Project focuses not only on rural
transport needs but also on preparing a major shift of road maintenance activities from
force account to contracting them out.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Objectives and Covenants
2.    The overall project objective was to maximize the impact of the resources avail-
able in the highway subsector. It was translated into implementation of a maintenance
program, including 800 km of road rehabilitation and 225 km of bituminous concrete
overlays; improvements to personnel management and training; establishment of road
management and cost accounting systems; increases in the density of traffic counts; and
improvements in road equipment maintenance. The Bank identified key organizational
actions that were used as conditions for loan processing. Loan covenants covered organ-
izational actions and a detailed action plan and were designed to promote achievement of
project objectives.
Evaluation
3.    The objectives were appropriate. The Bank required that formal organizational
steps be taken and this delayed negotiations until the Bank, realizing the complexity of
the legal steps involved, changed this condition from negotiations to effectiveness. Dur-
ing implementation, DGPC gave uneven attention and support to the project objectives
and resisted some institutional changes. This weak Borrower's ownership was a risk un-
foreseen at appraisal.
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
Achievement of Objectives
4.    Sector policies and financial objectives were only partially achieved. The tight
budget for recurrent maintenance supplies and operations increased satisfactorily during
the five-year period covered by the SAR and beyond, and many physical road mainte-
nance targets were reached. Some of the more important targets set for 1992, however,
have yet to be reached in Tunisia's 1996 budget.



- v -
5.    Institutional development objectives, as well, were only partially achieved. Im-
provements to personnel management and training and to the road laboratory, and the es-
tablishment of a cost accounting system, were successful. The road management system,
however, is not yet operational, and traffic data collection and the maintenance of road
equipment have not improved.
6.    Physical objectives were also only partially achieved, (107% of bituminous con-
crete resurfacings but only 75% of road rehabilitations), mostly due to cost changes and
rigidities in budgeting and programming.
Sustainability
7.    Project sustainability is likely. It will depend, however, on the Borrower's com-
mitment to making in-depth reforms to road network management and financing, and to
contracting out maintenance. Such reforms are being prepared under a follow-up project.
Costs and Delays
8.    Cost changes, due to the long delay between engineering studies for the first year
of works and implementation, and higher than expected local inflation, were important
for the road rehabilitation element. The availability of counterpart financing was a limit-
ing factor and led to the cancellation of about $ 1.2 million of the loan amount at closing.
There were some implementation delays due to slow decisionmaking (in particular for
procurement of consulting services), restricted flow of information, the slow compliance
with formal institutional covenants at effectiveness, and the Gulf War.
Key Factors
9.    Consulting services had limited impacts in some areas due to timid DGPC owner-
ship of institutional objectives, counterproductive requirements by the highest procure-
ment body, and the lack of on-site construction experience of local consultants.
10.   The need for pavement overlays was underestimated, in part due to the delay be-
tween engineering studies and implementation, and this led to not optimizing impact on
road users for the road rehabilitation works. Furthermore, bridge works were programmed
separately from pavement works, resulting in either road safety hazards, or in leaving
project roads subject to flood disruptions.
Bank and Borrower Performance
11.   The Bank's performance was satisfactory overall. However, during the appraisal
period, procedural difficulties in meeting the formal institutional conditions the Bank had
put for negotiations led to unusual delays from appraisal to negotiations to effectiveness.
The conditions led to a successful human resource element but also led to reduced quality
of the road rehabilitation works by making the technical studies outdated.
12.   The Borrower's performance was satisfactory at preparation but deficient at im-
plementation, due to slow decisionmaking, rigidities in procurement and budgeting, and
timid support given to institutional elements.
v

Outcome
13.   The project outcome is rated satisfactory. Economic returns are high, road main-
tenance budgets have increased dramatically, the backlog of road rehabilitation has been
reduced, and the training of personnel has been improved. However, the management of
force account road maintenance activities could not be improved. This is not surprising,
as it has now been established that the best road maintenance practice is to rely mostly on
the private sector for both a large part of road maintenance works and the maintenance of
the residual equipment fleet. Thus, road maintenance activities will now need to be reor-
ganized around a drastic reduction in force account capacity (reduced equipment fleet and
work force), the contracting out of most maintenance activities to local contractors, the
transfer of rural and regional roads ownership to the regional councils, and corresponding
budgetary reforms.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATION, AND KEY LESSONS LEARNED
Findings
14.   The Borrower's ownership of the institutional objectives was overestimated dur-
ing the appraisal period.
15.   The lack of timely availability of counterpart funds played a negative role in proj-
ect implementation.
16.   The highest procurement body (Commission Supdrieure des Marches) made
counterproductive requirements when it required DGPC to provide vehicles, equipment,
office space, and counterpart personnel to consulting assignments. Since these elements
were already in short supply in DGPC, this made the assignments difficult to start and to
implement and contributed to ineffective use of costly foreign expertise.
Project Operation
17.   The Government did not provide a plan for the project's future operation. DGPC,
however, indicated that it plans to overlay project roads with bituminous concrete to im-
prove pavement roughness; widen their narrow bridges, and replace most of their fords
with bridges. DGPC is also preparing reforms to contract out road maintenance; the ex-
tent and implementation speed of these reforms could be used as indicators in monitoring
progress of road maintenance management.
Lessons for Future Projects
Development Objectives
18.   The Bank should assess the complexity of the legal steps involved and the related
risks of delays when attaching conditions to loan processing steps.
19.   Appraisal should estimate the balance of financing between dinars and dollars and
related foreign exchange risks, by using variable annual exchange rates based on the
vi



- vii -
constant purchasing power rule. Similarly, a project account system should be set up al-
lowing to reconcile payments in US dollars and in dinars.
20.   Road rehabilitation should extend to solving all identified problems at the same
time for a given section; the needs usually include widening / construction of bridges and
culverts, raising the road surface above flood levels, and treatment of spots with an ab-
normal concentration of accidents.
21.   Consultants should be more involved in supervision of works to build experience
on the site and feed it back in the design of subsequent similar projects.
Implementation
22.   Due to the need to ensure continuity in project management from preparation to
completion, organizational structures where different units are responsible for different
phases of the project cycle (preparation, appraisal and implementation) should be
avoided.

REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
HIGHWAYS MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT (2896-TUN)
IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
STATEMENT / EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
Objectives at Appraisal
1.    The principal objective was to improve the use of resources by improving the
management of the road network. Specifically, the project aimed at:
*  improving the efficiency of road maintenance through organizational changes
and strengthening;
*  achieving a proper balance in highway expenditures among maintenance, re-
habilitation, and new construction;
* reducing the backlog of road rehabilitation; and
* improving personnel management and training.
2.    To achieve these objectives, the project comprised:
* a five-year maintenance program, of which the Bank financed all periodic
bituminous concrete resurfacing carried out by contract (225 km), renewal of
road equipment and facilities, and equipment for repair workshops;
* 800 km of road rehabilitation by contract;
* improvement of the human resources management system, of which the Bank
financed consulting services and overseas training; and
*  institutional development and studies, including the establishment of a new
road maintenance unit, the improvement of equipment maintenance, the rein-
forcing of laboratory services, and economic and detailed engineering studies.
Evaluation of Objectives and Risks
3.    The objectives were clear, realistic, and important for Tunisia's development
strategy. They were not complex or demanding for DGPC.
4.    The SAR mentioned that the only foreseeable risk was related to the timely avail-
ability of counterpart funds and that speciai supervision and monitoring measures were
included in the project to minimize this risk.
5.    During implementation, the Borrower's priorities shifted somewhat. Some project
elements (mostly the "hardware" part of the project, i.e. road works and supply of road
equipment) received much more management attention than others (the "software" part,
i.e. the institutional objectives). The overall objective of better road network management



ICR                                    - 2 -                             2896-TUN
was also a casualty of DGPC's emphasis on physical results and resistance to institutional
changes. The lack of timely availability of counterpart funds played a negative role in
project implementation (the project's road rehabilitation length was cut, in part for lack of
counterpart funds, while about $1.2 million of World Bank financing was canceled at
project closing), but the most important limiting factor was DGPC's rather timid com-
mitment to the institutional objectives and its unwillingness to jostle bureaucratic aspects
in order to fulfill them. This weak Borrower's ownership of these objectives was a risk
unforeseen at appraisal.
ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Sector Policies and Financial Objectives
6.    The achievement was partial. The stated objective of achieving a proper balance
in road expenditures among maintenance, rehabilitation and strengthening was only par-
tially translated into one specific project goal and one procedure spelled out in the project
action plan. The goal was to increase the quantities of road rehabilitation and mainte-
nance works over the 1988-1992 period in accordance with agreed targets, which rebal-
anced the activities with major backlog and ensured an overall growth of 6% per year in
real terms. The procedure was a mechanism by which the Bank was consulted before the
annual road budgets were finalized. Project design was weak on financial objectives,
which were not explicitly spelled out in the SAR. Furthermore, the figures and criteria for
establishing adequate recurrent and capital budgets were inconsistent and scattered
throughout the SAR.
7.    Results were globally positive, the awareness increased. major imbalances were
corrected, some of the more important physical targets were reached or surpassed over
the period while others were not. The budget for recurrent maintenance supplies and op-
erations, which is where the crunch was, was very close (-4%) to the SAR targets ad-
justed for actual local inflation over the 1988-1992 period and again in 1996 is very close
(-3%) to adjusted SAR targets. Many physical road maintenance targets were reached or
surpassed, however, some of the more important ones set for 1992 (patching of paved
roads and grading and regravelling of unpaved roads) have yet to be reached in the 1996
budget.
Institutional Development
8.    The achievement was partial. Improving the efficiency of road maintenance
through organizational changes and strengthening and improving personnel management
and training was translated into (a) establishing an organization and methods unit (for
establishing road management and cost accounting systems and improving the density of
traffic counts); (b) improving mechanical equipment maintenance; (c) reinforcing labora-
tory services; (d) establishing a training directorate; and (e) preparing a five-year training
action plan.
9.    The organization and methods unit was established, but the initial objective of
countrywide use of modem road network management tools had to be scaled down dur-



ICR                                   - 3 -                              2896-TUN
ing implementation to a pilot introduction in six governorates. As it turned out, even this
reduced objective was not reached, since only the analytical accounting package is being
used while neither the road management system nor the new approach on traffic counting
are operational.
10.   Four new regional workshops were to be built and equipped, and technical assis-
tance was to help the equipment directorate of DGPC establish a five-level set up for
equipment maintenance; develop equipment inspection functions; improve equipment
maintenance tracking and monitoring and inventories management. Also, a few existing
provincial workshops were to be rehabilitated. The regional workshop and the technical
assistance programs, however, were canceled for lack of funds and lack of DGPC owner-
ship, while only limited reforms were introduced (equipment inspection) and the provin-
cial workshops were rehabilitated. The funds for technical assistance were not used for
this element. Currently, the equipment fleet remains oversized, heterogeneous, underused
and under-maintained and equipment management and supervision is still weak. Why did
the Bank agree to the cancellation of the regional workshop program? At the time of
project appraisal, it was still conceivable to carry out most road maintenance by force ac-
count and thus to develop a large program to address its traditional weakest point, the
maintenance of the equipment. Now it has been established that the best practice is to rely
mostly on the private sector for not only a large part of road maintenance works but also
the maintenance of the residual equipment fleet required by a reduced force account ca-
pability. Thus the program would have been a step in the wrong direction.
11.   Consulting services for the road laboratory and for training had satisfactory
achievements, as did the establishment of a human resource system for personnel man-
agement, and training. A comprehensive training action plan was prepared and imple-
mented. Training actions, still would be more effective were they integrated into a com-
prehensive career and professional growth system. This success follows previous at-
tempts to improve personnel management and training, which had failed because of the
lack of institutional framework. A study to prepare a follow-up (rural roads) project was
added and had satisfactory achievements.
Physical Objectives
12.   The achievement was partial. The physical objectives were (a) 225 km of bitumi-
nous concrete resurfacings, and (b) 800 km of road rehabilitations. The actual achieve-
ments were: (a) 240 km of bituminous concrete resurfacings (107% of objectives), and
(b) 596 km of road rehabilitations (75% of objectives). The reduction in the length of
road rehabilitations is due to a higher per km cost and to rigidities in budgeting and pro-
gramming, which did not permit increasing annual budgets for the element. In terms of
value, the physical objectives were reached (para 23).
Economic Evaluation
13.   The SAR does not mention an overall ERR. The road rehabilitation element had a
minimum ERR of 30%. The road maintenance program had ERRs ranging from 28% to
48% at appraisal, and no ERR was reestimated at completion because, despite moderate



ICR                                    -4 -                               2896-TUN
cost increases, the traffic levels and the improvements in pavement roughness are in the
ranges that usually bring high ERRs.
14.   ERRs for 584 km of road rehabilitation ranged from 30% to 100% at appraisal.
An economic reevaluation was carried out at completion on all rehabilitated sections on
the basis of actual cost of works, traffic counts in 1987 and 1992, updated estimates for
1994 traffic and beyond, updated VOCs, and estimated maintenance costs based on opti-
mum strategies. The revised ERRs range from 26% to more than 100%, with a median of
70%.
MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Not Generally Subject to Government Control
15.   Several project consulting assignments had a two-and-half year period between
the start of the procurement process and the start of the assignment, due in part to the
Gulf Crisis. This delay impacted negatively on institutional development.
Generally Subject to Government Control
16.   Consultant services were procured with some delays and used with uneven results.
This was mainly because, in order to reduce foreign costs, the highest procurement body
(Commission Superieure des Marches) made counterproductive requirements when it re-
quired DGPC to supply vehicles, equipment, office space and counterpart personnel.
Since these elements were already in short supply in DGPC, this made the assignments
difficult to launch and to implement.
17.  In addition, local laws and regulations do not differentiate procurement of con-
sultant services from procurement of civil works. Thus one could find unexpected pro-
curement procedures or clauses in consultant contracts such as late penalty clauses and
bid and performance bonds. Also, tax laws applicable to consultant contracts are com-
plex. There is, for example, a registration fee for all contracts; its amount is nominal for
studies but reaches a high 3% of the contract value for technical assistance.
18.   Furthermore, local consultants in Tunisia are used almost exclusively to prepare
feasibility and detailed engineering studies and are rarely involved in works supervision.
This results in studies that may be unrealistic or difficult to implement, since consultants'
staff are rarely given the opportunity to accumulate field experience. On-site construction
experience and feedback should be used to improve the design of subsequent similar
projects.
Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control
Impact on road users
19.   The sections of the road rehabilitation element for the first year were selected on
the basis of their widening needs, to improve capacity and safety, with the strengthening



ICR                                        -5 -                                   2896-TUN
needs (on about one-third of the length) secondary. Usually the order of priority is re-
versed for technical reasons' and to better answer users' needs (because strengthening can
drastically improve pavement roughness, the main parameter of user comfort), while
widening-only rehabilitations are kept to a minimum, when the existing congestion calls
for urgent action. During implementation, the order of priority was rightly reversed at the
light of increased pavement failures which led DGPC to increase the proportion of
strengthening to 62% of project roads. The remaining sections will be programmed to
rapidly receive a bituminous concrete overlay, which should bring their roughness to ac-
ceptable levels.
20.   DGPC could have paid more attention to optimizing the positive impact of the
road works on the road users by aiming to make itineraries more homogeneous, and at the
same time focusing on solving all the needs of the project sections instead of program-
ming works by type. Some road sections are still using fords or submersible bridges (Irish
bridges) instead of (high) bridges and culverts or have sudden variations of road width
because bridge and culvert construction or widening was deemed of lower priority and
would be carried out separately. Some other sections are still regularly flooded, and rais-
ing them could have been included in the project with substantial cost savings compared
to raising them later. Finally, spots with abnormal accident concentration were identified
and treated not systematically but on an ad-hoc basis. It should be said, however, that an-
swering all of these needs would have led to more costly rehabilitation works for which a
larger budget would have been needed at the expense of other road investments. A fully
operational road management system would assist considerably the decision makers on
that matter.
21.   The overall quality of the road rehabilitation element was barely satisfactory, due
to several factors: the low quality of the technical studies, the time gap between these
studies and the actual works (with the pavements deteriorating further during the period),
the quality of contractors' work, and the quality of supervision.
Implemnentation of studies and technical assistance
22.   DGPC was late in supplying foreign consultants with office space, telephone
lines, vehicles, specialized equipment, and counterpart staff. When supplied, it was often
short of contractual requirements, and contributed to ineffective use of costly foreign ex-
pertise. DGPC did not give full support to the technical assistance teams, particularly the
one working on the network management tools. As required by the legal documents,
DGPC established a training directorate and a training steering committee, and appointed
a training director; however, when the appointed official was transferred to another posi-
tion outside DGPC early in the project period, no replacement was ever made.
1 Widening a road without concurrent pavement strengthening is technically challenging to do correctly
due to the need to reach high pavement densities on the two narrow pavement strips on each side to
avoid differential settlements; the presence of an overlay allows one-sided widenings, which are eas-
ier to compact correctly, and reduces the effects of differential settlements.



ICR                                        -6 -                                   2896-TUN
Cost Changes
23.   The main project component, the 800 km of road rehabilitations, were estimated
at appraisal to cost DT 50.440 million or $60.770 million, including contingencies. This
translates into about 63,000 DT / km or $76,000 / km. At completion, 596 km of rehabili-
tation had been carried out at a cost of DT 55.425 million (a 9.9% increase) or $58.089
million (a 4.4% decrease). This translates into about 93,000 DT / km (a 47.6% increase)
or $97,500 / km (a 28.3% increase).
24.   These wide variations, justified in part by changes in exchange rate and by the
need to increase the proportion of pavement strengthening, show that:
*   the engineering studies for the first year works on which the appraisal was
based had become too old at implementation time to be accurate;
*   SARs should be conservative in estimating: (i) the physical contingencies
(changing at negotiations to a higher ratio than the standard 10% could have
been justified to compensate for the ripening quality of the engineering stud-
ies); (ii) the price contingencies 2; and (iii) the exchange rate risk (at appraisal
cost estimates were computed in local currency and converted to US Dollars
using a fixed exchange rate of DT 0.83 / US $1.00, which was prevailing at
appraisal time3; the actual exchange rate varied moderately during the 1988-
95 period, between DT 0.83 and 1.01 per US $, with a period and project av-
erage of DT 0.93 / US $); and
*   a minimum of flexibility is necessary in the Government's annual budgeting
and programming process to match the World Bank financing without large
cancellations at the project completion.
25.   Thus the SAR had an inaccurate estimate of the balance of financing between di-
nars and dollars. The problem was compounded by the Government's reluctance to pro-
vide additional local financing during the implementation period to match the World
Bank financing. At the end, $1,213,185.20 was canceled from the loan. This cancellation
would have been about $3.6 million larger, had the Bank not agreed to finance, late in the
project, the procurement of 40 additional graders. Also, DGPC had the handicap of not
having set up a project accounting system capable of reconciling payments in dinars and
in US dollars.
2They were computed on the 5-year expenditures program ending in 1992 while the disbursement sched-
ule was in line with the 7.5-year disbursement profile ending in June 1995 and which was proven ac-
curate; a 13.7% price contingency was used while the actual international price inflation was 19.8%
for the period 1988-92 or 29.4% for the period 1988-95 and local price inflation was 40.8% for 1987-
92 or about 490/o for 1987-95.
3The World Bank software Costab has the option of using Constant Purchasing Power Parity exchange
rates, where annual exchange rates are computed on the basis of the inflation differential between the
local and foreign elements. This method would have minimized the exchange rate risk.

Implementation Delays
26.   The project was declared effective ten months after Board presentation, due to
delays in setting up and staffing the training directorate and the training steering commit-
tee and appointing the project coordinator. Thereafter, lengthy procurement procedures,
followed with zeal but with no sense of urgency, delayed (in combination with the Gulf
war) the start of the first road works by another seven months and the start of the studies
and technical assistance by about two years. Shortages of counterpart funds also contrib-
uted to delays by forcing implementation in phases.
27.   The main reason for project delays was, however, organizational. The slow deci-
sionmaking process was compounded by the restricted flow of information and docu-
ments within DGPC and to the regional directorates. The project was prepared by the
Study Directorate of DGPC and the road works were implemented by the regional direc-
torates. A project coordination unit was created but was not involved in preparation, and
during implementation was not directly involved in contract management and financial
aspects. At the end, however, the loan closed on time because, even if the initial project
implementation schedule and provisions for contingencies were too optimistic, the loan
closing date was rightly set to match the standard disbursement profile for highway proj-
ects.
PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
28.   Project sustainability is likely. There is a caveat, however, as it has now been es-
tablished that the best road maintenance practice is to rely mostly on the private sector for
both a large part of road maintenance works and the maintenance of the residual equip-
ment fleet. Thus project sustainability will depend greatly on the Borrower's commitment
to making in-depth reforms in road network management, maintenance, and financing.
Such reforms are being considered and prepared under the follow-up project (Loan 3840-
TUN, Rural Roads Project). They would include a major push in favor of contracting out
most road maintenance, the transfer of rural and regional roads ownership to the regional
councils, and corresponding budgetary reforms. Furthermore, DGPC plans to systemati-
cally resurface project roads with a bituminous concrete overlay. This, combined with a
program to construct, rehabilitate, and widen bridges and culverts, would in a short period
bring the level of service of the project roads that were only widened to satisfactory lev-
els.
BANK PERFORMANCE
Identification
29.   Performance is rated satisfactory. The project was identified as a follow-up phase
of the Fourth Highway Project (Ln. 1841-TUN), under which a major road maintenance
study was carried out. It included five-year slices of road and bridges rehabilitation and
maintenance programs, and emphasized the need to develop and implement a pavement



ICR                                   - 8 -                             2896-TUN
monitoring and evaluation system, a training program, and a traffic management unit.
The project also included elements to be implemented by the Ministry of Transport.
Preparation
30.   Performance is rated satisfactory. The Bank emphasized the need to reorganize
DGPC for more efficient road maintenance and to appoint a project coordinator.
Appraisal
31.   Performance is rated marginally satisfactory. The Bank's insistence on the formal
establishment of a training directorate and a training steering committee within DGPC,
and personnel had positive impact on the satisfactory achievement of the human resource
element. However, this insistence, together with organizational changes in both the Gov-
ernment and the Bank, was also the main reason for the unusual 19-month period be-
tween appraisal and negotiations. When it was realized that a decree from the Prime
Minister was necessary for the project to go forward, that became a condition of effec-
tiveness, which took another year to be fulfilled. The loss of momentum and the increased
risks in project implementation (cost overrun or quality of works) that resulted from the
increased time gap between studies and actual road rehabilitation works and from the
rushed post-appraisal could have been prevented with better communication. The SAR
was weak on cost estimates and had some minor incoherence.
Implementation
32.   Performance is rated satisfactory.
BORROWER PERFORMANCE
Preparation
33.   Performance is rated satisfactory.
Implementation
34.   Performance is rated deficient. Decisionmaking was slow, in particular for pro-
curement of consulting services. The departments responsible for some of the institution
building did not have the commitment nor the capacity to handle technical assistance and
there was no strong pressure from the hierarchy to make things change.
ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
35.   The project outcome is rated satisfactory. Economic returns are high, road main-
tenance budgets have increased dramatically, the backlog of road rehabilitation has been
reduced, and the training of personnel has been improved. However, the management of
road maintenance activities could not be improved and will need to be reorganized
around a drastically reduced equipment fleet and work force and the contracting out of
most maintenance activities to local contractors.

PROJECT'S FUTURE OPERATION
36.   The Government did not provide a plan for the project's future operation. DGPC,
however, indicated that it plans to overlay project roads with bituminous concrete to im-
prove pavement roughness, to widen their narrow bridges, and to replace most of their
fords with bridges. DGPC is also preparing reforms to contract out road maintenance; the
extend and implementation speed of these reforms could be used as indicators to monitor
progress in improving management of road maintenance activities.
KEY LESSONS LEARNED
Development Objectives
37.   The Borrower's ownership of the institutional objectives was overestimated dur-
ing the appraisal period.
38.   The Bank should assess the complexity of the legal steps involved and the related
risks of delays when attaching conditions to loan processing steps.
39.   Appraisal should estimate the balance of financing between dinars and dollars and
related foreign exchange risks, by using variable annual exchange rates based on the
constant purchasing power rule. Similarly, a project account system should be set up al-
lowing to reconcile payments in US dollars and in dinars.
40.   Road rehabilitation should extend to solving all identified problems at the same
time for a given section; the needs usually include widening / construction of bridges and
culverts, raising the road surface above flood levels, and treatment of spots with an ab-
normnal concentration of accidents.
41.   Consultants should be more involved in supervision of works to build experience
on the site and feed it back in the design of subsequent similar projects.
Implementation
42.   The lack of timely availability of counterpart funds played a negative role in proj-
ect implementation.
43.   The highest procurement body (Commission Supirieure des Marches) made
counterproductive requirements when it required DGPC to supply vehicles, equipment,
office space, and counterpart personnel. Since these elements were already in short sup-
ply in DGPC, this made the assignments difficult to launch and to implement and con-
tributed to ineffective use of costly foreign expertise.
44.   Due to the need to ensure continuity in project management from preparation to
completion, organizational structures where different units are responsible for different
phases of the project cycle (preparation, appraisal and implementation) should be
avoided.

REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
HIGHWAYS MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT (2896-TUN)
APPENDIXES
MISSION'S AIDE-MEMOIRE (EXTRACT)
Une mission Transport de la Banque Mondiale composee de MM. J. Bentchikou et
M. Loir s'est rendue en Tunisie du 29 novembre au 14 decembre 1995. Elle a ren-
contre en particulier MM. Mondher Znaidi, Ministre du Transport, Ali Chaouch,
Ministre de l'Equipement et de l'Habitat, Kamel Ben Rejeb, Directeur Gen6ral de
la Cooperation Multilaterale, Ministere de la Coop6ration Internationale et de
l'Investissement Exterieur, ainsi que leurs principaux collaborateurs. La mission
tient a les remercier pour leur accueil et collaboration. Cet Aide-memoire presente
les principales conclusions des discussions tenues au cours de la mission.
Rapport d'achevement
Le projet est clos depuis le 30 juin 1995 et $1,212,525.95 (du pret 2896-tun se
montant a $63 millions) ont 6t6 annules au 31 octobre 1995. Le graphe des decais-
sements du projet est en Annexe 2. La mission a participe a la collecte des donnees
pour le rapport de la Banque d'achevement du projet. II est rappele que
l'emprunteur doit egalement preparer et fournir a la Banque son propre rapport
d'achevement. Ce rapport doit comporter les commentaires de l'emprunteur sur la
mise en oeuvre du projet, la mise en operation des investissements du projet, les
couits et avantages, une evaluation de la performance de l'emprunteur et de la Ban-
que dans la mise en oeuvre de leurs obligations contractuelles respectives et
l'evaluation. II a ete convenu qu'un projet de rapport de 1 'emprunteur sera transmis
a la Banque avant la fin decembre 1995 et comportera en particulier une etude
economique d'evaluation retrospective basee sur les cofits reels et l'uni et les
comptages de trafic effectues aprs la fin des travaux.
Conclusions provisoires
Les principales conclusions de la mission sur l'evaluation retroactive du projet sui-
vent; elles ne sont que provisoires, dans l'attente de donnees chiffrees sur le trafic
et l'uni en particulier.
Impact sur l'usager de la route
L'objectif du projet etait d'ameliorer la gestion du r6seau routier tunisien pour
maximiser les effets sur l'usager de la route des ressources financieres forcement



ICR                                          - 22 -                                    2896-TUN
limitee qui sont consacree au reseau routier. II est donc tout naturel de juger
l'impact du projet du point de vue de cet usager. En l'absence des resultats de
l'6tude economique d'evaluation retrospective, it est difficile de quantifier cet im-
pact, meme si l'on s'attend a ce que ces donnees confirment la grande justification
6conomique du projet. Ces conclusions provisoires se concentreront donc sur les
aspects qualitatifs. S'il est frappant que les travaux routiers du projet ont contribu6
d'une maniere indeniable a ameliorer le reseau routier et sa gestion, il est aussi
frappant de penser qu'avec un faible effort supplementaire on aurait peut-etre pu
obtenir un impact bien plus grand sur l'usager. II s'agit essentiellement des 6le-
ments qui suivent.
Homog6neite et sectionnement
Lorsque des travaux de rehabilitation sont programmes sur une section donnee de
route, il est bon de traiter tous les problemes en une seule fois au lieu d'en etaler la
realisation dans le temps, car cela minimise le cout total, la gene de l'usager, et les
imnimobilisations improductives. De plus, I'absence de certains de ces elements ou
des discontinuites de largeur peuvent creer de veritables pieges pour l'usager.
Idealement, les travaux de rehabilitation devraient s'articuler autour d'un renforce-
meent de la chaussee, piece maitresse, et comporter la creation d'un systeme de
drainage complet longitudinal (fosses) et transversal (dalots, passages buses), la
construction d'ouvrages d'art, la mise hors d'eau de la chaussee, 1'elargissement de
la chaussee et des ouvrages et la r6fection/modernisation des points de concentra-
tion d'accidents.
II faut normalement eviter que les variations brutales de largeur de chaussee ou
d'accotement, qui peuvent etre autant de pieges pour l'usager, meme si la signali-
sation est adequate, en particulier A cause de l'incitation a aller plus vite que consti-
tue une route nouvellement rehabilit6e. II est donc normalement prevu d'inclure
dans les travaux de r6habilitation, 1'elargissement de tous les passages buses, pon-
ceaux, dalots, et ouvrages d'art.
Par ailleurs, certaines sections du projet conunencent ou se terminent en plein ali-
gnement, sans que l'usager puisse rattacher la variation de largeur a un indicateur
visible. II semble que la logique d'une repartition equitable des enveloppes limites
ait prevalu, tout en creant un piege potentiel, mais relativement mineur, pour
l'usager.
*  Visite du 11 decembre 1995: Lot R13c, Le Kef, GP17. Au Pk 122,2 se trouve
un pont sur l 'oued Gorbet de 16 m de long et 4,80 m de chaussee avec deux
trottoirs de 0,60 m. De part et d'autre du pont la chaussee a et elargie ai
7,40 m. Ce pont etroit constitue un piege pour l'usager et a ete le siege de
deux accidents mortels en 1995.
Renforcements
Le projet prevoyait 800 km de rehabilitations. Initialement, s'il etait prevu que la
totalite de ces sections devait etre elargie, seulement un tiers de ce lineaire devait
6galement subir un renforcement. Cette priorite donnee aux elargissements etait
pour le moins inhabituelle et s'est, logiquement, averee la source de nombreux
problemes. En cours d'execution, la Dgpc a heureusement decide d'augmenter le



ICR                                         - 23 -                                   2896-TUN
lindaire renforce, mais des rigidites dans la disponibilite des credits a malheureu-
sement conduit a une reduction du lineaire rehabilite a 585 km environ. Si le total
des sommes allouees en toute derniere minute en fin de projet a I'achat de 40 nive-
leuses et du montant annule en fin de projet avait et6 consacre aux rehabilitations,
le projet aurait pu financer environ 85 km de plus. A la fin, 62% du lineaire des
sections rehabilitees ont 6te renforcees.
Comme cela a et dit plus haut, normalement le renforcement est la piece maitresse
des programmes de rehabilitation car il ameliore l'uni, parametre essentiel pour
l'usager, permet un elargissement unilateral, bien plus facile a compacter correcte-
ment, permet un bien meilleur contr6le du profil en travers et donne une occasion
supplementaire a l'entreprise de corriger les imperfections de l'elargissement. En
bref, un elargissement seul est bien plus difficile a realiser et il faut attendre la rea-
lisation d'un renforcement quelques annees plus tard pour que l'usager beneficie
pleinement de l'investissement realise en deux phases. De plus, le cout actualise
total et la gene a l'usager pendant les travaux plaident aussi en faveur de la realisa-
tion combin6e renforcement - elargissement. La realisation des travaux de rehabili-
tation du projet illustre ces 6lements.
  Aide-memoire du 27 fevrier 1992: Lots R8a & b, Kairouan, GP2, Pk 65 a

bords de chaussee. La chaussee a un mauvais uni et presente epaufrures et
faiencage. Le renforcement semble etre necessaire.
*  Aide-memoire du 27 fevrier 1992. Lot R8c, GP13, Sidi Bouzid, Pk 74,6 a

faien,age et peau de crocodile, ainsi qu'une fissure continue ai la liaison
avec l 'elargissement. Malgre un trafic relativementfaible de 1400 v/j en 87-
88, le renforcement semble etre necessaire.
*  Aide-m6moire du 27 fevrier 1992. Lot R9a, GP13, Sfax, Pk 6 a 44,7. La
chaussee de largeur variable est faiencee. Le trafic lourd de 2900 vlj doit
justifier le renforcement.

Ouvrages d'art, drainage et mise hors d'eau
II est frappant de constater qu'en Tunisie, une partie du reseau routier n'est pas mis
hors d'eau. En zones de plaine, les chaussees sont souvent au niveau du terrain
naturel ou en dessous alors qu'un leger remblai (0,5 a lm) est souhaitable pour des
raisons de mise hors d'eau et de drainage transversal. II y a un manque systemati-
que d'ouvrages d'art pour les franchissements d'oueds et de dalots ou passages bu-
ses pour le drainage transversal. Au lieu de passer en dessous des chaussees, 1'eau
passe donc systematiquement au dessus; les passages a gu6 correspondants formant
"cassis" pour le profil en long, comportent souvent des radiers betonnes. II en re-
sulte une rupture de profil en long, un danger pour l'usager, des coupures de routes
frequentes, et une contrainte de maintenance et de desablage. De plus, le drainage



ICR                                            - 24 -                                    2896-TUN
de la chaussee est souvent inexistant ou insuffisamment entretenu. Les fosses lat&
raux, quand ils existent, ne sont pas toujours cures, n'ont pas toujours de pente cor-
recte et n'aboutissent pas toujours dans un exutoire naturel. Le drainage transversal
est souvent manquant, et les fosses ne comportent pas toujours de buses de conti-
nuite en cas d'acces lateraux pour riverains et routes de desserte. Les accotements
sont souvent insuffisamment entretenus, sureleves (ou au contraire trop en contre-
bas) par rapport A la chaussee et d'une pente insuffisante. II en resulte des accumu-
lations d'eau sur les bords de chaussee (la partie de la chaussee la plus sollicitee par
le trafic lourd) ou sur les accotements.
Face a cette situation generale, il aurait et raisonnable de penser que ces proble-
mes seraient corriges systematiquement lors des travaux de rehabilitation. Malheu-
reusement, cela n'a pas ete le cas du projet et l'inclusion implicite dans les marches
de tels travaux de drainage et inise hors d'eau est plus Y'exception que la norme,
comme illustre ci-dessous.
*  Aide-memoire du 27 fevrier 1992: Lot R6, GabNs/Medenine, GP], Pk 408,5

des riverains ou des routes de desserte.
I Aide-memoire du 29 mai 1992: MC 71, Le KefJ lots Ril c. Une section im-
portante de route est regulierement inondee. Line etude est en cours pour re-
soudre ce probline, elle se base sur le remplacement de trois ouvrages, la
surelevation de la ligne rouge et le drainage de la zone.
I  Visite du 11 decembre 1995. Lot Rlla, Le Kef; MC 71, Pk 1,6 a 20. Une
section de 3 km est restee en contrebas du terrain naturel et est reguliere-
ment inondee. C'est un problme de section urbanisee oi /'entree des habi-
tations limite les possibilites de surelevation de la route.
Points de concentration d'accidents
II est egalement raisonnable pour l'usager de penser que les sections rehabilitees of-
frent une securite routiere amnlioree par rapport A la situation ancienne. Or, il
semble que les etudes techniques n'ont pas cherche A syst6matiquement identifier et
traiter les points de concentration d'accidents (points noirs), besoin qui s'est mani-
feste par la suite.
*  Aide-mnemoire du 27 fvrier 1992. Lot R6, Gabes/Medenine, GP], Pk 408,5

en long sur ces points noirs a ete' entreprise.
Uni
L'uni est le parametre qui influe le plus sur les couits d'operation des vehicules et
sur le confort des usagers de la route. Les sections du projet on fait l'objet de me-
sures systematiques soit d'uni soit de deflexion apres la fin des travaux. La mission
n'a pas eu acces A ces donnees qui seront envoyees A la Banque. Cependant, les ob-
servations visuelles ne manquent pas pour montrer que l'amelioration de l'uni a et
insuffisante. Les plus mauvais unis correspondent aux sections qui ne comportaient
pas un revetement en beton bitumineux.

*  Visite du 1I decembre 1995: Lot R2, Kairouan, GP3, Pk 60 ai 75,1. Cette
section, elargie sans renforcement dans le projet en 1989-91 a ete renforc9e
en 1995 par 6 cm d 'enrobe avec reprise des accotements. L 'uni final n 'est
pas de la qualite esperee apres un renforcement en enrobes. La largeur du
renforcement est irreguliere avec des debordements frequents (qui auraient
du etre coup&s) et le rechargement des accotements en tuff comporte trop de
tres gros elements qui auraient du2 etre cribls. La deuxieme section, Pk 116-
142,2, n 'a pas encore ete renforcee apres l 'elargissement. I y a des tasse-
ments differentiels tres nets entre cet elargissement et l'ancienne chaussee,
avec affaissement de I'elargissement et presence de flaques d'eau qui illus-
trent clairement le probleme. L'uni d'ensemble est mauvais et 1'enduit su-
perficiel est rate par endroits.
Qualiti
Qualite des travaux
11 y a de nombreux exemples dans le projet de qualite marginale des travaux. 11 est
possible aujourd'hui d'obtenir une meilleure qualite de travaux dans des pays com-
parables a la Tunisie avec un programme d'assurance qualite au sein des entreprises
et un contr6le de qualite un peu plus meticuleux, par exemple dans la purge des
faiblesses de la chaussee existante, et dans la coupure droite des bords de chaussee.
*  A ide-memoire du 27 fevrier 1992: Lot R6, Gabes/Medenine, GP], Pk 408,5
ai 474. Les travaux presentaient a la jonction chaussee - elargissement des
dlgradations (fissures, affaissements et nids de poule). Il faut couper la
chaussee bien droit, et bien compacter l 'elargissement.
*  Aide-memoire du 27 fvrier 1992: Lot R2, Zaghouan, GP3, Pk 60 ai 75. Les
travaux sont en cours definition. II y a affaissement de 1 'elargissement, res-
suage et peignage de 1'enduit superficiel et un mauvais uni de la chaussge
qui aurait du etre renforcee. L 'entrepreneur a ete invite lors de la r&eption
provisoire a refaire un enduit monocouche sur les parties degradees.

sion recommande qu'une attention particuliere soit porte d'une part ai la
purge des materiaux argileux d'accotements existants pour eviter la conta-
mination des couches nouvelles et d'autre part, a l'impregnation immediate
des sections renforcees avant de les livrer a la circulation pour eviter les
dommages considerables et le mauvais uni que celle-ci a causes. Le reste
des travaux est de bonne qualite.

*  Aide-memoire du 26 mars 1993. GP13, lot R9a et GPl4, lot R9b. La qualite
des travaux est bonne en gen&ral, mais pourrait etre amelioree en ce qui
concerne le lot R9a. La mission recommande que pour ce lot, une attention
particuliere soit portee. (i) a la technique d'elargissement afin que cette
operation ne cree pas un point de faiblesse au droit du bord de I 'ancienne
chaussee; en effet, ces bords sont encore tres largementfissuris par endroits
alors que ces zones fissurees auraient dci etre systematiquement, proprement
et delicatement coupees; (ii) aux sections proches de Sfax qui sont en tres
mauvais etat et dont le renforcement est necessaire; la grave 0/20 prevue
pour une rectification de profil en long de zones qui paraissent moins priori-
taires, peut etre utilis4e ai cette fin; (iii) ca la qualite de la grave 0/20 qui est
trop heterogene; (iv) au malaxage de la grave 0/20; la technique de ma-
laxage a la niveleuse sur chaussee devrait etre abandonn&e au profit d'un
malaxage et d'une humidification sur lieu de stockage; et (v) au respect du
profil en travers afin d 'e'viter les problemes d 'un mauvais drainage.
*  Aide-memoire du 26 mars 1993: Les travaux du lot R9b sont de qualite' sa-
tisfaisante. Toutefois, une attention plus particuliere doit etre accordee au
compactage de la couche de renforcement (taux d 'hum idite et verification du
nombre et de la qualite des passes).
  Aide-memoire du 14 janvier 1994: GP 2 et 13, lots R8a, b et c, Kairouan et
Sidi Bouzid. La qualit6 des travaux est bonne en general. Elle pourrait cepen-
dant etre amelioree en ce qui concerne les enduits superficiels.
*  Aide-memoire du 28 iuin 1994: GP 2 lot R8a, GP 3 lot R3 et MC 99 lot R2,
Kairouan et Sidi Bouzid. Le comportement sous circulation est satisfaisant.
Quelques remarques sont a faire en ce qui concerne les enduits superficiels
oui il y a des problemes de dosage bitume/granulat, mais surtout de mise en
oeuvre. Le revetement du lot R8a de la GP 13 (travaux en voie
d'achevement) est, par contre, tout a fait satisfaisant. L'entreprise semble
maintenant bien maitriser cette technique particulierement dJlicate.
Qualite des etudes
Beaucoup des problemes constat6s auraient pu sans doute &tre regl6s au moment de
l'etude. Dans quelques cas, 1'etude utilisee 6tait trop ancienne et de nombreux
changements ont du etre apportes en cours de realisation. II est rappele qu'il est
toujours plus rentable et efficace de regler un probleme potentiel au niveau de
l'etude.
*  Aide-memoire du 27 fevrier 1992: Lot R6, Gab?s/Medenine, GP], Pk 408,5

travaux. Le trafic en 92 est de 8700 v/j avec un fort pourcentage de poids
lourds, dc^ a l'ouverture de la frontiere avec la Libye, posterieurement a la
finition de 1 'etude.
Qualite du contr6le

d'intervention des laboratoires de chantier ne semblent pas etre clairement
indiquees dans les contrats. La Dgpc soutient que le cotat d'installation est
compris dans le prix installation de chantier, ce que conteste I 'entreprise. Le
resultat est que I'entreprise n'a pas de laboratoire sur le chantier et qu'elle
utilise le moins possible celui de l 'administration car ilfaut payer les essais.
Impact sur le developpement institutionnel
Les etudes et l'assistance technique du projet n'ont eu qu'un impact relativement
limite sur le developpement institutionnel.
Direction de 1'exploitation et de 1'entretien routier (Deer)
L'assistance technique a la Deer avait pour but la creation d'un service de
l'inspection et d'un Service Organisation et Methodes (Som) afin de promouvoir
l'amelioration et l'optimisation des strategies d'entretien et de la programmation
des taches correspondantes et d'ameliorer considerablement l'efficacite des sonunes
et moyens limites consacres a 1'entretien routier. Elle a connu un demarrage diffi-
cile et n'a que rarement reussi a produire les resultats escomptes, faute de partage
complet des objectifs, d'une bonne collaboration avec les responsables et en
l'absence des moyens materiels et humains qui auraient ete necessaires. L'objectif
initial d'une introduction g6neralisee d'outils modernes de gestion de reseau a dcu
etre ramene en cours de projet a une introduction plus raisonnable limitee a six
Dreh pilotes. Cependant, meme ces objectifs reduits n'ont pas pu etre atteints a la
fin du projet. La nouvelle comptabilite analytique, Coges, est un succes qui est ap-
pr66ci et utilise r6gulierement mais les banques de donnees et les nouvelles stations
de comptage sont encore loin d'etre operationnelles dans les directions pilotes.
*  A ide-memoire du 29 mai 1992: (..) Cette amelioration passe par la mise en
place de banques de donnees routieres et des ouvrages d'art, et de reformes
importantes de la comptabilite analytique ainsi que des methodes de reali-
sauion des comptages et des travaux. Elle demande un effort important de
coordination des actions complementaires de la Deer, de la Dpt, du Cetec,
et des Dreh. Elle comporte une premiere phase pilote sur six Dreh mais ne
produira des avantages substantiels que lorsque 1'ensemble des Dreh aura
et touche.
*  Aide-menmoire du 29 mai 1992. Le trafic routier sur chaque section et sa
composition sont les parametres les plus importants de la gestion d'un re-
seau routier, car ils conditionnent le niveau et le type de 1'entretien et le
calendrier du renforcement, elargissement ou remise en itat. Or
l'information actuellement disponible sur ces parametres essentiels est la-
cunaire. De part la nature aleatoire du trafic, une campagne de comptage
tous les cinq ans (certaines sections n 'ayant que 2jours de comptage) est in-
suffisante pour fournir des renseignements fiables. La mission recommande
que, conformement aux termes de reference de I 'ettude, le consultant se pen-
che sur ce proble' dfes que possible etffasse des recommandations pour son
amnlioration.

bonne gestion de re'seau.
Direction du materiel (Drn)
Le projet prevoyait la reorganisation de l'entretien du materiel par la creation d'un
nouveau niveau inter-regional de reparation du materiel (echelon 4), la construction
et l'equipement de quatre ateliers correspondants, le developpement de la fonction
d'iinspection du materiel le suivi des couits d'exploitation du materiel et une assis-
tance technique importante (36 h-m). De tous ces objectifs, seule l'inspection du
materiel a recu un debut d'ex6cution (50% des Dreh ont une inspection technique).
Les ateliers inter-regionaux ont ete abandonnes pour des raisons de couit et
I'assistance technique a ete remplacee par un audit exterieur au projet. La situation
du mat6riel de la Dgpc ne s'est pas amelioree avec le projet. Le materiel est ple-
thorique (plus de 1.300 unites), heterogene, sous-utilise et mal entretenu. La ges-
tion et le suivi du parc sont insuffisants. Cette situation est une des justifications les
plus importantes de la necessite de privatiser l'entretien routier et la gestion du
materiel de I'administration.
Laboratoire (Cetec)
L'etude avait l'ambition de preparer le renforcement et l'organisation du labora-
toire routier. Apres de nombreuses difficultes administratives de demarrage,
l'objectif initial a e  consid6rablement reduit et les consultants ont effectue une se-
rie de missions ponctuelles, qui ont abouti, entre autres, a la d6finition du materiel
d'auscultation de chaussees achete sur le projet.
Direction du perfectionnement technique (Dpt)
Cet element etait ambitieux et a abouti a la definition et au demarrage d'un plan de
formation pluriannuel. Cependant, il faut aussi signaler que le poste de directeur est
reste vacant pendant une longue periode et la faiblesse de l'integration des actions
de fornation dans un systeme couvrant les carrieres, les promotions et visant a in-
tensifier la motivation du personnel.

phase I est en cours. La mission constate que le renforcement du systeme de
gestion du personnel, qui est un objectif essentiel du programme et des ter-
mes de references de l 'etude, semble avoir ete perdu de vue. Ilfaudrait cor-
riger le tir. Par ailleurs, le poste de Directeur de la Dpt continue a ne pas
etre pourvu de titulaire permanent et cette absence, combinee avec celle
d'un homologue, a des effets nefastes sur la realisation des objectifs a long
terme de l'etude, sur V'integration et la coordination interne de 1'equipe et
sur sa coordination avec les autres services de la Dgpc.

Management du projet et organisation institutionnelle
La gestion du projet a subi des lourdeurs bureaucratiques qui ont frein6 le dyna-
misme des responsables dont les grandes qualites ne sont pas en cause, et qui pour-
raient sans doute etre corrigees dans le futur sur la base d'une organisation amelio-
ree, d'un echange plus libre d'informations class6es, de leur traitement et de la
conception et animation d'equipes pour resoudre des problemes precis.
Procedures de passation des marches
On constate que ces procedures ont en general e  longues, trop longues. Ce projet
a eu a faire face a des circonstances exterieures defavorables, mais neanmoins,
d'autres projets de la Banque pendant cette periode n'ont pas eu autant de retards.
Les regles de passation des marches repondent en g6neral a des objectifs precis et
forment un ensemble compliqu6, surtout en cas de financeinent exterieurs. Les
aborder d'une maniere dynamique en favorisant le dialogue constructif avec les au-
tres partenaires administratifs et en cherchant a minimiser le chemin critique et les
temps morts apporte en general des r6sultats remarquables. Les aborder de maniere
passive en cherchant avant tout a minimiser tout risque de critique ult6rieure, en
g6n6ral permet d'atteindre le but fixe mais au prix des retards constat6s.

de travaux, comme le present projet, demandent une certaine souplesse dans la
programmation pour exploiter A fond les financements disponibles. En effet, les fi-
nancements en Dinars pour les fonds de contrepartie et en Dollars pour les fonds
internationaux se combinent sur chaque element du projet et la nature meme des
programmes finances demande des ajustements sur les tranches annuelles de tra-
vaux. La Dgpc a correctement corrige le tir initial dans le programme de rehabili-
tation en doublant la proportion des renforcements dans ce programme, mais elle
n'a aussi malheureusement pas pu obtenir A temps des ajustements aux fonds de
contrepartie pour tenir compte du couit supplementaire des renforcements. Elle a
aussi omis de mettre A jour les engagements financiers au fur et A mesure de
I'avancement des travaux sur le terrain. Cette mise a jour s'est faite en une seule
fois a la fin des derniers travaux et a degage d'importantes sommes qui auraient pu
etre utilisees pour financer des renforcements supplementaires. D'autres ajuste-
ments a la baisse dans l'utilisation des Dollars du projet auraient ete necessaires
pour tenir compte des variations de taux de change et de I'annulation de la cons-
truction des ateliers du IV' 6chelon et de l'outillage et materiel d'entretien routier.
Le gouvernement a ainsi perdu environ $1,2 millions du pret Banque et cette
somme aurait pu etre bien plus elevee (environ $ 3,6 millions de plus) si la Banque
n'avait pas fait un effort exceptionel et accept6 de financer, tard dans le projet, un
march6, non initialement prevu, d'achat de 40 niveleuses.
II faut egalement noter que la Dgpc manque d'un outil de gestion de projet qui lui
aurait permis de suivre et d'ajuster regulierement les engagements en Dinars et en
Dollars et de gerer dynamiquement les sommes-A-valoir pour imprevus physiques et
financiers.
*  Aide-memoire du 28 decembre 1992: La mission a revu le cozt previsionnel
du projet en fonction du montant de base des marches approuves ou prevus,
de la provision pour alias et revision des prix et des variations passdes et
previsionnelles du taux de change. Le montant de la part de la Banque
Mondiale depasse legerement pour l'instant le montant du Pret 2896-tun

mais les provisions devraient etre revise's a la baisse pour de nombreux
marches en cours d'achevement.
* Aide-memoire du 26 mars 1993. La Dgpc est en train de remettre a jour le
tableau de cozut du projet en reevaluant les provisions pour fluctuation des
marches termines sur le terrain. Il faudrait parallelement engager les der-
nieres depenses d 'achat de materiel de laboratoire, de mesure de trafic et
autre materiel lie a la mise en place de la banque de donnees routieres et de
matriel et logiciel informatique. Le tableau rectifqe et les depenses ai enga-
ger devraient apparaitre dans le prochain rapport periodique d 'avancement.
*  Aide-memoire du 26 mars 1993: L'absence de moyens a caracterise le de-
marrage de l'etude et le calendrier et la consistance des taches du projet
doivent subir des ajustements periodiques majeurs mais ni la Deer ni le con-
sultant n'utilisent d'outil informatique moderne de gestion de projet. La
mission recommandefortement l 'utilisation immediate de Microsoft Project,
ou d'un outil semblable, pour decomposer l'etude en taches elmentaires,
analyser leurs interdependances et les moyens n&cessaires, etablir le chemin
critique etfaire des ajustements reguliers. Cette approche plus anticipatrice
permettra I'elaboration de strategies alternatives pour conjurer les effets de
ressources insuffisantes, et autres parametres qui &chappent a la Deer.
  Aide-memoire du 3 novembre 1995: En 1'espace de quelques mois, les ta-
bleaux financiers pre'visionnels de la Direction de Realisation du Sixieme
Projet Routier (Drspr) sont passes, pour la part financee par la Banque,
d'un degpassement d 'environ S275.000 ai un excedent d 'environ $1.2 million
parce que les engagements financiers n 'avaient pas et ajustes depuis la si-
gnature du marche et donc refletaient mal la realite du terrain. La Drspr, en
realit, ne fait que coordonner la mise en oeuvre des elements du projet par
d'autres services de la Dgpc ou des Dreh. Cela n'est pas a priori mauvais,
mais necessite une bonne circulation des informations et l'utilisation d'un
bon outil de gestion de projets. Il semble imperatif qu'en premiere phase
deux actions soient prises. D'une part, qu'un service comptable soit cre' a
l 'interieur de la Drspr avec pour tdche essentielle de tenir une comptabilite
"ingenieur" des engagements (c 'est-a-dire degagee du cadre financier ac-
tuel, rigide et quelquefois inadapte) ayant pour objet d'ajuster les sommes
engageies (variations dans les quantites pre'visibles a la fin du marche et
sommes-a-valoir) et tenir a jour la meilleure estimation du cou^t final.
D 'autre part, il faudrait que les decomptes du projet passent par la Drspr
avant d 'etre remis a7 la Direction Financiere de la Dgpc.
Prises de decision
Une certaine sclerose semble avoir caracterise le projet lorsque quelques decisions
devaient etre prises. Cela pourrait sans doute etre grandement ameliore si tout les
e1lments de la dynamique de communication decrite plus haut (circulation
d'informations et animation de travail d'equipes) etaient mis en place.

*  Aide-memoire du 29 mai 1992: Le Huitieme Plan comporte actuellement
l'amenagement de 700 km de pistes agricoles, alors que le marche d'etude
ne comporte que 400 km de projet d'execution complet. Pour les 300 km
restant, il est donc necessaire soit de passer un avenant au marche soit de
lancer une etude separee.
*  Aide-memoire du 28 decembre 1992. Pour les 300 km restant, il est donc
n&essaire de passer un avenant au marche.
*  Aide-memoire du 26 mars 1993. L'etude a deja pris un retard de deux mois
ai la suite de difficultes d 'enquete et d'une sous-estimation des besoins en
personnel. La mission a ete surprise de constater un tel retard, qui est en
contradiction avec les demandes repetees du Gouvernement aupres de la
Banque Mondiale pour accelrer la preparation du Septieme Projet Routier.
Cette etude etant sur le chemin critique de cette preparation, ilfaudrait donc
que la Dgpc suive de particulierement pres les progres du consultant et
fasse tout pour eviter des glissements ulterieurs. Il est toujours prevu de
passer un avenant au marche de cette etude afin que la totalite des 700 km
de pistes ai amenager puisse faire l 'objet d 'une etude de faisabilite, mais au-
cune demarche n 'a encore ete entreprise en ce sens.
Assistance Technique, Organisation et Methodes de l'Entretien Routier
*  Aide-memoire du 27fevrier 1992: Les locaux et les homologues assignes a
cette assistance technique sont actuellement insuffisants.
*  Aide-mnmoire du 29 mai 1992: L'operation a atteint une phase dans
laquelle I 'absence de moyens se fait durement sentir. Les locaux, les homo-
logues et le materiel assignes a cette tdche sont actuellement insuffisants. Le
Meh vient d 'attribuer au Som un local a proximite immediate du Ministere.
Cette separation physique a des avantages et des inconvenients mais le bilan
total cdoit etre largement positif car cela va permettre aux agents de se con-
centrer sur la mission principale du Som. La mission recommande que la
totalite du materiel manquant (y compris le logiciel "Edouart") soit achete
en bloc (par exemiple ajoute dans le marche) et finance par le projet et que
les taches de premiere collecte et verification de donnees soient sous-
traitees a un bureau d 'etude local.
*  Aide-memoire du 28 d&embre 1992: L'absence de moyens a caracterise le
demarrage de l 'etude. Les homologues et le materiel assignes a cette tdche
sont insuffisants. La mission recommande a nouveau que le materiel man-
quant soit achete en bloc et que les homologues manquants soient affectes
d 'urgence.
*  Aide-memoire du 26 mars 1993: L 'etude a maintenant atteint un plateau in-
termediaire important mais a entre-temps pris un retard de I 'ordre de 6 mois
et les questions de la revision de son calendrier et de son objectiffinal res-
tent posees. II est clair desormais qu'il faut limiter l 'objectif immediat de
cette cooperation a la mise en place du systeme de gestion de 1'entretien
routier dans les 6 Dreh pilotes, et au fonctionnement operationnel satisfai-
sant de ce systeme pendant au moins un an. Pendant cette periode, une eva-

luation detailke de l'objectiffinal devra etre effectuete et les moyens et le
calendrier de 1 'extension du systeme au reste des Dreh devront etre soumis ci
I'approbation du Dgpc. La mission a attire l'attention clu Dgpc sur le pro-
bleme majeur rencontre dans le deroulement de 1'etude, qui reste encore le
personnel. Sur les 2 ingenieurs et de 3 agents techniques dont la Deer ai be-
soin, il est urgent et important qu'elle obtienne aussito^t que possible un in-
genieur au minimum pour qu'elle dispose d'un responsable pour chaque
produit (Bdr, Bdoa, Coges). Une affectation diu personnel necessaire qui
n'interviendrait qu'en fin de contrat donnerait un argument de poids aux
critiques de la Dgpc car cette assistance technique couiteuse en devises
n 'aurait pas eu la possibilite d 'assumer la totalite de son potentiel de trans-
fert technologique et deformation de personnel. Par ailleurs, la coordina-
tion entre la Deer et la Dpt pourrait etre ame'lioree car les stages de forma-
tion informatique de base n'ont et organises qu'avec un retard qui a gene
le bon deroulement de l 'etude.
Etude de Renforcement et d'Organisation du Laboratoire
*  Aide-memoire du 29 mai 1992: La consultation avait &j lancee en avril
198? mais malheureusement la prestation n'a pas encore demarre. La
guerre du Golfe et une serie de difficultes d 'ordre administratifsont les cau-
ses principales du retard.
Etude Formation.
*  Aide-memoire du 27 fvrier 1992: Les locaux et les homnologues assignes ri
cette assistance technique sont actuellement insuffisants.
I Aide-memoire du 29 mai 1992: La mission recommande que la formation
soit compl6tie par l'utilisation de materiaux audiovisuels disponibles sur le
marche. La mission est d'accord pour la prise en charge sur le projet de
l 'achat du materiel audiovisuel n&essaire.
Documentation Technique
*  Aide-memoire du 29 mai 1992: Les differents services, tant a Tunis que dans
les Directions Regionales, travaillent souvent dans des conditions difficiles
avec une insuffisance de documents techniques de reference et de travail. La
mission a propose qu'un contact soit pris avec le Setra pour la fourniture
reguliere par cet organisme a la Dgpc des documients pratiques qu 'il publie.
en nombre suffisant pour qu'ils soient immediatement disponibles pour les
ingenieurs routiers. La mission est d'accord pour la prise en charge sur le
projet du cozut correspondant, sur la base par exemple, d'unforfait annuel.
Organisation du projet
L'Ulement qui manque le plus dans l'organisation actuelle est le retour
d'experience. 11 y a une trop grande compartimentalisation entre ceux qui preparent
les projets et ceux qui les executent, entre ceux qui preparent ou contr6lent les etu-
des et ceux qui contr6lent ou executent les travaux. Un meilleur brassage



ICR                                            - 34 -                                    2896-TUN
d'experience pourrait etre assur6, non seulement au niveau de l'organisation des
projets mais aussi au niveau de l'organisation des carrieres des individus.
Les projets gagneraient a etre identifies, prepares, evalues, negocies et mis en oeu-
vre par une equipe unique. Idealement il faudrait une equipe par groupe de projets
similaires et chaque equipe devrait comporter en son sein un bon assortiment
d'experience, du debutant a l'ingenieur chevronne, de la planche a dessin au terrain
en passant par le laboratoire, des chaussees aux ouvrages d'art, du secteur public
au secteur prive, etc. Lorsqu'une meme equipe execute ce qu'elle a prepare, elle
continue de preter une grande attention aux e1lments qui avaient ete identifies
comme importants lors des etudes. De plus et surtout, elle tient compte et beneficie
lors des preparations de nouveaux projets des lecons apprises lors de l'execution
des projets similaires.
II est egalement important que les individus puissent beneficier de ce brassage
d'exp6rience au cours de leurs carrieres professionnelles. Pour cela il faudrait pou-
voir assurer une rotation plus systematique entre les postes des Dreh et les postes a
Tunis, entre les postes d'etudes, de laboratoire et de travaux. Enfin il faudrait aussi
6viter un cloisonnement des carrieres entre secteurs public et priv. Un fonction-
naire devrait pouvoir etre mis en detachement pour travailler temporairement dans
le secteur prive (bureaux d'etudes et entreprises) et retrouver un poste satisfaisant a
son retour et vice versa, 1'etat devrait ouvrir la possibilit6 de mettre des agents
contractuels venant directement du secteur prive a tous les niveaux de responsabili-
te, dans les Dreh et a Tunis.
Finalement, il est aussi important que ce retour d'experience puisse se faire au sein
meme des bureaux d'etudes. Pour cela il faut utiliser ces bureaux d'etudes, non
seulement pour les etudes ponctuelles technico-economiques de travaux particuliers
mais aussi les charger de surveiller et contr6ler ces travaux. En chargeant ces bu-
reaux des taches de maitre d'oeuvre, sous la direction et le contr6le du maitre de
l'ouvrage delegue (le Dreh) et du maitre de l'ouvrage (le Dgpc) on fait d'une pierre
deux coups. D'une part, on contribue a ameliorer la qualite des etudes futures en
rendant les personnels des bureaux d'etudes plus familiers avec les proced6s de
construction et la realite du terrain. D'autre part, on introduit ainsi une gestion pri-
vee plus efficace que la gestion administrative et on simplifie l'organisation des
Dreh, qui n'ont ainsi pas a faire face a des variations des besoins en personnel
(experience et quantite) d'une annee a l'autre en fonction des variations des pro-
grammes d'investissement.
*  Aide-memoire du 3 novembre 1995: La preparation duprojet a et essentiel-
lement la responsabilite de la Direction des Etudes de la Dgpc alors qu'il
est mis en oeuvre par la Drspr. Ce type d 'organisation a des defauts impor-
tants et est conside'rei obsolete. Une organisation de projets moderne utilise
un noyau d 'equipe commun du debut (identification) a la fin de l 'ex&ution
d 'un projet. Cela assure la continuite, rentabilise au maximum les efforts de
conception et enfin, lorsque l 'on considere une serie de projets, assure un
retour d 'experience de 1 'execution vers la conception qui est essentiel pour
ameliorer la qualite de la conception.

La Dgpc et les Dreh ont du personnel de qualite, mais la structure et l'organisation
bureaucratique dans laquelle ils travaillent actuellement montre des faiblesses qui
empechent la pleine utilisation des moyens mis en oeuvre. II faut tout d'abord pre-
ter une oreille tres attentive aux usagers et veiller a ce que les programmes de tra-
vaux soient definis pour avant tout satisfaire leurs besoins, meme si cela doit en-
gendrer quelques complications administratives. Cela passe en particulier par la re-
solution simultanee de tous les types de problemes des sections routieres conside-
rees et par une recherche systematique de la qualite. Cela conduit aussi a sous-
traiter un maximum de tAches au secteur prive et a redefinir le r6le de l'etat dans la
gestion du reseau routier. Ce r6le devrait etre celui du proprietaire qui gere son
patrimoine consciencieusement pour le valoriser au maximum (c'est-a-dire minimi-
ser les cofits d'operation des vehicules) et qui surveille etroitement 1'etat et
l'evolution de l'utilisation de ce patrimoine (auscultations et comptages), planifie
les investissements et les charges recurrentes d'entretien, programme et passe les
marches pour les travaux correspondants et s'adresse au secteur prive pour leur
mise en oeuvre et contr6le.

BORROWER CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
INTRODUCTION
Le present document constitue le rapport d'achevement du Gouvernement,
du sixieme projet routier pour lequel le pret 2896-TUN d'un montant de 63
millions de dollars US a ete accorde.
Ce pret a ete approuvd le 15/1/88, il est entre en vigueur le 17/10/88
et a ete cl8turd le 30 juin 1995 comme prevu initialement.
Les decaissements se sont eleves a 61,8 millions de dollars et une
somme de 1,2 millions a ete annulee, tandis que le montant total du projet
ea dinar a atteint 92,63 millions contre un cout estime a 83,44 millions.
1- PRESENTATION
Lea -=;sent projet a pris le relais du quatrieme projet (pret 1841-
LUN) af in dz poursuivre le rattrappage de l'entretien routier et intrrduire
-.s r6foLa s et ameliorations institutionnelles a plus long terme
Le principal objectif du projet est llam6lioration de l'utilisation
des ressources, notamment grice a une meilleure gestion du reseau routier
tun-isien. Le projet vise plus particuli8rement:
a) a ameliorer l'efficience de l'entretien des routes, grace a une
reorganisation et un renforcement des services;
b) a creer un meilleur equilibre dans les depenses routieres entre
les   comoosantes    entretien,    rehabilitation   et   nouvelles
constructions;
c) a  reduire  les  retards  accumul]s  dans  la  rehabilitation  des
routes;
d) a ameliorer la gestion du personnel et sa formation dans le sous-
secteur routier.
Le projet a ete evalue au cours des missions des experts de la Banque
d-ws mois de Mars 1986 et Octobre 1987. Le projet propose comporte les
I Dea ts suivants:
a) Un programme d'entretien tant courant que p6riodique, y compris
l'achat de mat6riel d'entretien. la construction et l'equipement
dlatelier, l'equipement de laboratoire et de circulation ( y
compris le materiel de pesage des vehicules);
b) Urn programme quinquennal de rehabilitation de routes sur une
longueur totale d'environ 800 kim;
c) l'amelioration du systeme de gestion des ressources humaines, y
compris l'etablissement d'une Direction de la formation et la mise
en oeuvre d'un plan quinquennal de formation; enfin
d) Le developpement institutionnel et la realisation d'etudes visant
a:
i) La creation d'une unite charg6e de lorganisation et des
methodes;
ii) L'amelioration et Ilentretien du materiel mecanique;
iii) Le renforcement des services de laboratoires;
iv) Des analyses economiques et techniques detaillees pour
l'exdcut on du programme de rehabilitation.

2- EXECUTION DU PROJET
2-1  De1ais  prevus  et enregistres:
Selon le calendrier initial,  le projet devait entrer en vigueur en
Mars 1988, l'execution de toutes les composantes sera achevee le 30/09/94,
soit au total apres six ans et demi. La date de cloture du pret est fix4e
au 30106/95.
Le report de la date de mise en vigueur du pret qui n'est survenue que
le 17 Octobre 1988,  soit sept mois   apres la date fixee au calendrier
dresse au cours de l1dvaluation, a eu pour incidence de retarder les dates
de commencement de l'ex6cution des composantes du projet (Cf annexe N1).
2-2 Prograi=e  de  rehabilitation
2-2-1 Consistance:
Le programme de rehabilitation du reseau rev8tu qui comportait
initialement environ 800 km a porte sur 596,2 km (reprdsentant 75% des
previsions cf annexe N02).
La  majeure  partie  de  ces  sections  sont  issues  du  programme
previsionnel indique en annexe 11 du rapport d' valuation.
Les travaux ont ete lances en groupe de lots successifs:
a) Les lots Rl A R7 couvrant un lineaire de    312,5 kms
c) Les lots R10 et Rll  "          "       "        98,4 kms
d) Les lots R8,R9,R12a,R13c et R17         "       185,0 kms
Ce programme comporte 21 lots repartis sur 14 gouvernorats.
I1 est A noter que plusieurs sections amenagees dans le cadre du 6Ame
projet routier sont la continuation des sections ameliorees dans le cadre
du 4eme projet routier.
2-2-2 Cout des travaux
L'annexe N3 contient lot par lot le montant initial (au contrft), le
montant de la fluctuation des prix et le montant ddfinitif des travaux.
En resume le coat des travaux de rdhabilitation se presente comme suit
Travaux, Fluctuation, S.A.V. 56.091 Millions DT
2-2-3 Commentaire:
Le projet initial nla pas dtd execute en totalite (596,2km au lieu de
779,2km) du fait que:
a- Les amenagements prevus en 1/3 renforcement et 2/3 elargissement
n'a pu etre respecte vu l'etat de la route et le niveau d'amdnagement
necessaire permettant de suivre Ildvolution du trafic sur les trongons
concernes, ce qui a amene l'administration a prevoir des renforcements
beaucoup plus importants que prevu.
b- Les prix retenus lors de 1'evaluation sont beaucoup plus inferieurs
A ceux de la date de lancement des marchds rdduisant ainsi la longueur
totale A amenager.

En ce qui concerne les remarques emises par l'expert de la Banque , A
lors de missions de supervision, sur la mauvaise execution de certaines
taches ou sur la qualite des mat6riaux, il y a lieu de remarquer que le
suivi et le contr8le des travaux effectu6s par les responsables techniques
centraux et regionaux, ont permis d'assurer une bonne execution des travaux
et ont amenes A une reception des projets se caracterisant par une qualite
conforme aux normes techniques exigdes.
Il est a noter qu'afin d'absorber le retard constate, l'Etat Tunisien
assure la continuite du programme de rehabilitation par:
a- l'execution de 258,6 km de rehabilitation sur les budget des ann6es
1994 et 1995, dont certaines sections font partie du reliquat du sixieme
projet routier,
b- le lancement d'un programme de 549,2 km au cours de l'annee 1996,.
c- la prevision d'un programme de 100Okm dans le cadre de 9eme plan
(1997-2001)
D'autre part, le Gouvernement Tunisien a procede depuis 1987 a une
augmentation notable des credits de l'entretien routier (Article 60) qui
ont ete multipli6s par trois et demi afin d'assurer un entretien efficient
du reseau routier classe ainsi que des routes rurales af in de garantir la
perennite du reseau. Il est A remarquer qu'une etude, commandite par le 7
eme Projet Routier, (relative A de la strategie A mener A llavenir dans le
domaine de l'entretien routier de point de vue moyens, institutions,
m6thodologie, regie ou entreprise...) est en cours de realisation.
Jusqu'A ce jour, l'entretien courant est realise en regie par les
moyens de l'Administration et le renouvellement de la couche d'usure en
b6ton bitumineux, le revetement superficiel et une partie du rechargement
des acc8tements et des pistes agricoles sont confies A llentreprise.
Pour les routes r6habilites, ladministration se chargera des taches
de l'entretien courant et periodique pour assurer la longevite du projet.
2-3 Couche d'usure en beton bitumineux:
2-3-1 Consistance
Dans le cadre du projet 239,8km de routes ont 6t6 revetues en beton
bitumineux rdpartis sur 10 gouvernorats
En parallele, des travaux similaires ont ete ex6cut6s sur le budget de
l'Etat  depassant  les  objectifs  arretes  A  l'annexe  N09  du  rapport
d evaluation.
2-3-2 Cout des travaux
Leg marches conclus ont connus quelques augmentations dans la masse
dues essentiellement A des corrections apportdes au profil en travers des
routes traitees. L'annexe NO 4 precise lot par lot le montant initial et
les montants definitifs des marches qui s'4llve A 13.048 Millions DT.
2-3-3 Commentaire:
Les besoins restent en dec& de ce qui a et6 realise, vu llaugmentation
du trafic lourd qui ne peut plus Atre supporte par le revAtement
superficiel traditionnel et le souci de confort necessaire aux voies A
grande circulation. Agissant dans cette politique lEtat a pr6conisd dans
le cadre du 8eme plan l'exdcution de 360 km en grave bitume et beton
3



bitumineux, et compte prevoir dans le 9eme plan l1ex6cution de 1400 km qui
int6ressent notamment les routes r6habilites dans le cadre du 6eme projet
routier.
2-4  Materiel et Equipements:
Cette composante peut etre subdivisae en trois 6lements:
- Mat6riel d'entretien routier.
- Mat6riel de circulation.
- Matdriel de laboratoire.
Le cout global du materiel acquis a atteint 19,5 millions D.T comme il
a ete estim6 dans le rapport d' valuation   (14,48 matdriel d'entretien
routier et 4,92 autre matAriel).
2-4-1 Mat6riel d'entretien routier:
La liste du materiel decrite A l'annexe N010 du rapport d'evaluation,
a subit des modifications a l'cquisition resume A l'annexe N05 ci-joint.
- Le materiel de produit noirs (9 ravitailleurs de liants 20.0001 et
12 epandeuses 90001) pour lesquels la Banque n'a pas accept6 la
solution retenue par la C.S.M.
- Le march6 pour l'acquisition de 8 Pick-up camionnettes, le
fournisseur slest desiste.
Acquisition en plus de
- 40 Niveleuses
- 8 vehicules pour le suivi des travaux
- un mini ordinateur
Pour un coOt total de 16.014 mille D.T au lieu de 14,5 millions DT
prevus.
2-4-2 mat6riel de circulation
Dans le cadre de cette rubrique trois marches ont 4t4 conclus pour
l'acquisition de panneaux de signalisation verticale et des compteurs de
trafic (cf annexe N05).
La realisation de cette composante n'a pas connu de difficult6s
particulieres de point de vue coat et delais.
le cout de ce materiel s'61eve a 1.791 Mille DT contre un coat
pr6visionnel de 1240 M.D.T sans imprdvus.
2-4-3 Materiel de laboratoire
En premier lieu deux marchbs ont ete conclus pour 1'6quipement du
laboratoire central et des cellules rdgionales en materiel d'essais de sol
et roche et des essais de beton et b6ton bitumineux(cf annexe N5).
En deuxieme lieu, et A la suite des recommandations du consultant pour
le renforcement des services du laboratoire, il a 6t6 ddcid6 d'equiper la
cellule d'auscultation des chaussees d'un analyseur de profil en long et
d'un deflectographe lacroix, la cellule d'ouvrage d'art d'un pont
d'extensometrie et la cellule de peinture de divers petit materiel.
Le  coat  de ce mat6riel  sde1eve  A 1.698 Mille  DT contre  un  coOt
previsionnel de 520.M.D.T sans impr6vus.

2-5 Services de consultants et 6tudes:
Dans  le  cadre  du  ddveloppement  institutionnel  et  la  rdalisation
d'&tudes, les march6s cites en annexe N06 ont ete finances par le projet.
Les services de ccnsultants ont connu des difficultes d'ordre administratif
pour la conclusion des marches, et de commencement des prestations qui a
coincide avec la periode de la guerre du golfe.
Le cout definitif de cette composante se monte a 3.506 mille   D.T
contre un coat previsionnel de 1.620 mille dinars qui a ete modifie par un
amendement de l'accord de pr&t ramenant la partie financee de 1450 mille
dollars a 2900 mille dollars.
2-5-1- Assistance technique au service Organisation et Methodes de
l'Entretien Routier:
L'objectif principal de cette assistance technique est d'ameliorer la
gestion de l'entretien des routes a travers une r6organisation des
services, la mise en place d'un service Organisation et Mdthodes et la mise
en oeuvre de nouveaux produits et methodes de travail. Elle a permis de
doter la D.E.E.R. des outils suivants:
a- la Banque de Donnees Routieres (B.D.R.):
Le logiciel VISAGE a ete installe a la Direction de l'Exploitation et
de l'Entretien Routier et dans six directions regionales pilotes (Tunis,
Bizerte, Le Kef, Sfax, Gabes et Gafsa) . Un programme de g6neralisation de
la B.D.R. a toutes les directions regionales est en cours de preparation a
la D.E.E.R.
Dans le meme cadre, le programme EVALUE a ete developpe, il a pour
objectif le traitement des donnees de la B.D.R. et la programmation d'une
hi6rarchisation des urgences  de travaux d'entretien des routes  en deux
priorit6s.
b- la Banque de Donnees Ouvrages d'Art (B.D.O.A.):
Cette banque de donnees informatis6e constituee de 9 fiches permet:
- La connaissance du parc d'ouvrages suivant divers criteres,
- L'evaluation de l16tat des ouvrages,
- Le suivi des programmes d'entretien des ouvrages
La  version  de  la  BDOA  developpe  sous  ACCESS  est  en  cours
d'exp4rimentation, elle contient encore des bogues informatiques A resoudre
par le consultant.
c- Systeme de Comptabilite de Gestion:
Il s'agit de la mise en oeuvre d'un Systeme informatise de traitement
des donnees de la comptabilitd analytique.  II offre plusieurs options de
gestion des facteurs de production et une multiplicite de synth&ses
effectues a differents niveaux (local, regional, central).
Le programme COGES a ete installe et teste au debut dans les six
directions regionales pilotes, ensuite il a ete generalise A 18 regions
disposant des moyens logistiques n6cessaires.
Le logiciel comporte encore des bogues qui necessitent l'intervention
du consultant.
En conclusion, cette assistance a 6te assez lente A mettre en oeuvre
pour plusieurs raisons (retards, manque de moyens, consultant, etc...) et
elle n'a pas recu la satisfaction qu'elle merite, cela nlemp&che que la
DGPC va continuer sur cet elan pour combler les lacunes qui persistent. Le
service organisation et methodes sera renforce par les moyens necessaires
et les outils de travail d6velopp6s seront generalis6s A travers toutes les
directions r6gionales.

2-5-2 Etude de renforcement et d'organisation des activitis de la
Direction du laboratoire:
Malgre les difficultes rencontres au demarrage, les interventions des
consultants ont touche tout le personnel du laboratoire et les chefs des
services des pants et chaussees. Ainsi, des missions des experts, d'une
duree de 14 homme-mois, ont interesse les cellules ouvrages d'art,
mecanique des chaussees,  chimie peinture et etancheite,  bitume  - liants
hydrocarbones, carrieres, ciment et sondages. D'autre part, le CETEC a
profite de la presence des experts Francais pour organiser des seminaires
et des tables rondes auquels ont pris part les ingenieurs et techniciens
des directions regionales. Les themes traites ont porte sur l'entretien des
routes (le revetement superficel, les enrobes, la presentation du materiel
d'auscultation des chaussees etc...)
Bien que le resultat peut atre juge valable, la consommation des
hommes-mois n'a pas atteint les previsions. Il est evident qu'il y a des
actions a organiser a l'avenir pour consolider les connaissances et les
pratiques deja dispens&s afin de permettre une mise a niveau de nos
ingenieurs.
2-5-3 Etude de renforcement de la formation du personnel:
A la suite de la creation de la Direction du Perfectionnement
Technique et du comite d'orientation de la formation, et en collaboration
avec le service de consultant,  les travaux realises ont ete concretis6s
par:
- Une etude de gestion des ressources humaines etendue & tout le
personnel de la D.G.P.C.
- un plan de formation pluriannuel 94-98 pour le personnel de la
DGPC,
- l'identification des moyens a mettre en oeuvre pour la
r6alisation de ce plan de formation.
Le plan de formation a 6te elabore a partir des besoins de formation
recenses a la suite des travaux de l'etude des ressources humaines
entreprise aupres de tout le personnel, tout en arrgtant les objectifs de
d6veloppement pour chacune des categories et fonctions demandees.
En outre, des actions de formation ont ete organisees afin d'am6liorer
l'entretien, le drainage et le revetement des routes, ainsi que l'entretien
du materiel  afin  d'en garantir la bonne maintenance. Ces  actions  ont
touches tout le personnel 1ie de pres ou de loin A l'entretien routier.
Bien que cette composante ait ete retardee, elle a ete executee d'une
facon satisfaisante, il est recommande que la DGPC puisse developper cette
unite en lui octroyant les moyens en personnel et materiel (cr6dits,
vehicules etc...) afin qu'elle puisse etre un outil moderne de gestion du
personnel.
2-5-4 Etude des programmes de rehabilitation:
Ces etudes ont pour objet la r6alisation des 6tudes economiques et
techniques et J.elaboration des dossiers d'Appel d'offres des travaux de
rehabilitation.
Les etudes ont et6 realises pour la deuxieme et troisieme tranche ce
qui a permis le lancement des travaux correspondants.
I1 y a lieu de remarquer qu'au cours de la realisation des travaux,
des adaptations et modifications ont ete apportees et notamment que le
6



projet initial pr6voyait les deux tiers du lineaire des routes a
rehabiliter en elargissement simple et le tiers en renforcement avec un
minimum dsam6nagement vu le coup de Ilestimation initiale. Ainsi quelques
projets de drainage hydraulique ont ete modifi6s afln d'adapter au mieu.
l'ouvrage au terrain et certaines rectifications du profil en long ont 6te
juges necessaires afin de garantir la visibilite, la s6curite et le confort
aux usagers de la route.
2-E ATELIERS:
Il a ete programme initialement de financer dans le cadre du projet
la construction ou la refection des   ateliers du III, IV et V echelons.
Toutefois,   la  reorganisation  de  l'Administration  Regionale  qui  est
intervenue a la suite de la decentralisation et de la deconcentration
instituees en Tunisie des 1989, n'a pas rendu opportune la creation
d'unites de maintenance ayant un caractere inter-regional.
3- CONCLUSION GENERALE:
Le sixieme projet routier a ete execute dans des conditions
satisfaisantes.
Avec l'exp6rience acquise, le renforcement institutionnel est destine
A se poursuivre durant les annees a venir.
Les rapports entre les experts de la Banque et les responsables
Tunisiens sont excellents, les 6changes de vues 6taient fructueux pour le
projet, et ont permis de mener a bien les diverses composantes ( travaux et
consultants) et de surmonter les difficultes rencontrees et d'achever le
projet dans les delais fixes.
