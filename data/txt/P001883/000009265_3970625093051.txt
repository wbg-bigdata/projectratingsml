ADRITIETS REVIS]ED PORT PROJECT
(Loans 976-MAS and l339T-MAS)-
PREFACE
1.        The Mauritius Port Project is the third of ten projects financed
by the Bank in Mauritius and the first of two projects in the transport
sector.  The second project in the sector is for highways (Ln. 2337-MAS)
approved in July 1983. The port project consisted of two loans: (i) The
first Loan No. 976-MAS for US$10.0 million was approved in April 1974 and
became effective in June of that year; (ii) the second Loan No. 1339-T-MNAS
for US$3.6 was approved in November 1976 and became effective in July
1977. The closing date was extended several times and was finally set at
December 31, 1983. The Loans were fully disbursed except for a
cancellation of about US$0.5 million for loan 976-HAS and a cancellation of
about US$0.2 million for loan 1339-T-MAS.
2.        This PCR was prepared by Transportation Division 1, the Eastern
and Southern Africa Project Department. The PCR was based on data
collected during the October 1983 project completion mission in Hauritius
and some information provided by the Mauritius Marine Authority (MHA).
3.        The project was co-financed by the OEM (UK) for the provision of
transit sheds, fire-fighting and port equipment totalling US$3.5 million
equivalent.
4.        In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments; their reply is shown
as an Annex.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MAI!TIUS REVISED PORT PROJECT
(Loans 376-MAS anad 1339T-MAS)
HIGHLIGHrS
1.        The original project (Ln. 976 of April 1974) was the first Bank
loan to Mauritius in the transport sector. It was intended to provide a
modern deepwater port in the existing capital city port - Port Louis. A
second loan (Lu. 1339-T-HAS) was provided in 1976 to cover cost overruns
which resulted initially from the sinking of the contractor's dredger soon
after the commencement of the original project. The project has been
successful in that Nauritius now has ample port capacity for its needs with
modern facilities and managed by a competent port authority.
2.        The revision of the berths layout following approval of the
second loan has resulted in a much more flexible and satisfactory port
layout which, with the rapid development of containerization, has enabled
the port to create a modern container terminal within the project scope
even though this was not envisaged at the time of the appraisal. Cost
overruns (of 92Z in MR's and about 23Z in US dollars) and long delays were
experienced with the port buildings largely as a result of the inexperience
of the newly created port authority MHA which naturally found it very
difficult to envisage its needs in a rapidly developing situation.
3.        Shortly after the new berths came into use it was found that
excessive settlement was occurring and remedial works contracts had to be
let in order to protect the investment which were financed under the
project.
4.        Points of particular interest arising out of this project are:
(i) Port labour surpluses and low productivity have been major
problems for the port (4.02, 4.03, 4.04). The labour situation
is extremely sensitive and bas been an issue for many years.
Now, with the recent formation of a national Cargo Handling
Corporation, it may be possible to iatroduce changes and reforms,
such as multiple shift working, to slowly improve productivity.
(ii) Appraisal projections for general cargo traffic did not
materialize mostly due to reduced import demand reflecting
prevailing economic conditions in the country (4.11).
(iii) Port productivity has been well above the appraisal forecast
largely due to changes in shipping technology particularly in
containerization and bulk handling of sugar (4.18).
(iv) From the institution building aspects, the MKA has grown into an
effective port authority under the technical assistance programme
and training provided partly through the project (6.01, 6.02).
(v) An important problem which has been successfully resolved by the
project was the high level of theft, damages and losses which
occurred with the lighterage operations. A review with
management of the MKA has shown that losses, theft and damage are
now very low, almost at the point of being negligible (9.01).



PROJECT COPLETION REPORT
AURU  REVISED PORT PROJECT
(Loans 976-MAS and 1339T-4AS)
I. Introduction
1.01      Prior to this project Mauritius had no harbour able to berth and
discharge general cargo vessels alongside quays equipped with transit
sheds, stacking areas and modern handLing equipment. Port Louis harbour,
the islands only commercial deep-water port, was at this time a well deve-
loped lighterage port and the operation was divided among various Govern-
ment departments and private cargo handling, stevedoring and warehousing
companies.  Ship turnaround times were excessive and damage and pilferage
rates high.
1.02      The Government, aware of these inadequacies, appointed consult-
ants (UK) , financed by the ODA (UK) to prepare a port master plan and a
first stage of development. On the basis of the consultants recommenda-
tions the Government decided to proceed with the construction of at least
two deep-water berths with the appropriate back-up facilities and also to
create a port authority to operate all the port's facilities on commercial
lines. Th° Government requested Bank assistance to help finance these in-
vestments.



2
II. Project Preparation and Appraisal
A. Original Project
2.01      A port project was appraised by two missions in June and October
1973 and Loan No. 976-HAS was approved in April 1974. This project comr-
prised the construction of three deep-water berths, two transit sheds, an
adinisStration buildIng, workshops and open storage areas, as well as con-
sulting engineering services for final design, specifications, tender docu-
ments and supervision of construction. Its total cost, net of taxes, was
estimated at US$16.1 million with a foreign exchange component of US$12.1
million or 75 percent. Dredging required in the port was expected to be
executed as an incidental part of an ongoing reclamation program financed
by the UK Overseas Development Ministry (ODM) in the nearby Her Rouge
area. As this program required considerable dredging to obtain suitable
material for the reclamation site, it was agreed that part of it could be
done at the port area, thus providing the dredging needed for the project
at nominal cost. ODM also agreed to finance the purchase of some port ope-
rating equipment.
2.02      In order to overcome the port operational inadequacies the
Government agreed to establish the Mauritius Marine Authority (MM&) which
would be totally responsible for port administration, operations and
finance. Although no difficulty was forecast in recruiting local profes-
sional staff for the senior posts it was realised that they would lack ade-
quate port experience and thus a technical assistance programme for admini-
stration, finance and operations was included in the project.
2.03      The loan became effective on June 13, 1974.  In August 1974,
while the dredger was working north of the reclamation site (not in the
project area), an explosion, most likely due to discarded World War II am-
munition, occurred in its discharge pump and the dredger sank. Both the
Government and ODM considered it advisable to terminate the reclamation
contract instead of insisting that the contractor complete it, in order to
avoid protracted legal procedures and to save related costs. The contract
was thus terminated which meant, that the dredging in the port basin was
discontinued. The Bank considered the Government's decision reasonable.
ODM subsequently agreed to provide a new, smaller dredger. This dredger,
while suitable for slow completion of the reclamation, could not be used to
complete dredging in the port which, after preliminary engineering, was
found to involve removal of coral rock which could have been handled by the
first, larger dredger. ODM was not willing to finance the higher Lost of
completing the dredging for the project berths and decided, instead, to fi-
nance the steel structures for the transit sheds, in addition to some port
operating equipment.



-3-
2.04      As a result of the loss of the large dredger, the Government and
its consultants (UK) reconsidered the alignment of the berths with a view
to minimizing costs and concluded that the volume and cost of dredging
could be reduced by building the third berth as a straight-line extension
of the first two berths, rather than at a 90-degree angle as originally
planned. The revised alignment permits more flexible berthing of vessels
and is thus operationally advantageous. In addition, the filling required
behind the realigned third berth produced a roughly 50 percent larger port
area behind the berths, compared to the earlier plan. The fill material
needed behind the third berth was to be either acquired by dredging or
trucked in from the Mer Rouge area.
2.05        The civil works tender documents were accordingly amended to
include completion of port dredging to the new alignment at its full cost,
including mobilization. Had the reclamtion dredger not been damaged, it
would have been more economical to align the third berth as originally
planned even with the coral rock dredging. However, as the reduction in
the volume of dredging required more than offset the unit cost increase,
the straight-line layout was the less costly alternative. After interna-
tional competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank Guidelines, the major
construction contract for the three berths and the required dredging was
awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder.   However, during -the delay in
awarding the civil works contract, caused by the dredging accident, prices
increased considerably, with the result that the estimated cost of civil
works was substantially higher than had been forecast in early 1974.  In
September 1975, the Government requested Bank Group assistance in financing
the cost of the revisions.
B. Revised Project
2.06        Since the project was a revision of an ongoing project, the
preparation normally associated with a project was unnecessary.  The ap-
praisal was based on Bank supervision missions findings, existing contract
unit prices and cost estimates prepared by the consultants and Bank staff.
2.07      A separate SAR was not prepared and the revised project was pre-
sented to the Board in the form of a President's Report.
2.08      The revised project components remained unchanged from the origi-
nal project - the only changes being the re-alignment of the third berth
and extensions to the periods of technical assistance to the MMA.



- 4-
2.09      The project components were:
(1) Three Berths and Related Facilities
Three deep-water berths, with transit sheds behind two of the
berths, and a container handLing and storage area behind the
third.  Port facilities to back up the 'erths included a port ad-
ministration building, port firestatio.L and workshops block, a
container control bullding and welghbridge. The re-alignmient of
the berths necessitated the construction of rock armoured buad to
retain and protect the fill material on the southern edge of the
site.
(ii) Dredting
The remaining dredging needed to provide the depths required for
the three berths together with the filling material to reclaim
the lands behind the berths.
(iii) Consulting Services
Engineering consultants from UK were appointed to carry out de-
tailed engineering and to supervise the construction of the civil
works. The firm was originally appointed by the Government in

III.  Project Implementation and Costs
3.01      Construction began in April 1976 and was expected to have been
completed by late 1979. In fact the construction work was not completed
uctil late 1983, a delay of four years. The bulk of the planned civil
works were completed on time - the new berths, transit sheds, pavlig work,
etc. - btt the firestation/workshops, port aidinistration building and the
container control buildifng were excessively delayed. In addition it was
found necessary to carry out remedial works to the new berths after their
completion to remedy a probable design fault. In retrospect the delays in
the cmmenement of construction of the port buildings was the result of a
combination of inexperience of the newly formed MMA and insufficient gui-
dance and advice by the consultants which led to numerous changes in de-
sign.
3.02      Revisions
The major revision to realign berth 4 which was made at the tine
of the re-appraisal was undoubtedly a correct decision and as a consequence
the port can operate much more easily and efficiently than if the original
concept had been kept. The benefits of a continuous marginal berth plus
very much increased land areas behind the berths are essential for present
day container operations and will be even more valuable in the future. The
Increased costs for filling the land have never actually been realised
since the MLA have not replaced the 231,000 cu. a of fill material borrowed
from the Mer Rouge area- this is now planned to be carried out by the MLA
over a long time frame using its own dredger as and when funds and time are
available.
Revisions to the firestationlworkshop and administration build-
ings seemed almost endless at one stage. The workshop floor was ill con-
ceived at the outset and had to be revised to meet the MkA's equipment
maintenance needs. The Administration Building was initially designed as a
prestigious but very inflexible building which proved too expensive. At-
tempts to reduce the costs by omitting finishes and reducing standards to-
gether with continuously changing MMA use patterns resulted in long delays
in reaching the tender stage and the final form, which although fully usa-
ble, was much too costly and lacks the flexibility required by a growing
organisation.
The most serious revision was the need to carry out remedial
works to the new quays structure a year after it had been completed and ac-
cepted. Two separate failures took place. The first consisted of the dis-
placement of part of the rock armour on the slope beneath the quay deck.
This rock was removed by wave action during a cyclone shortly after the
completion. The damaged area was fortunately restricted to the north end
of berth 2; however, the result was that the berth structure was now left
very exposed and it was considered essential to replace the rock as soon as
practicable - not an easy task under the deck with limited headroom and
working space. The second failure was much more serious. It had been
noted shortly after completion that differential settlement was occurring
between the concrete deck of the quays and the asphalted area adjoining



- 6 -
it. Prolonged survey and test holes eventually showed that fine materials
were being leached out of the reclamation fill by wave and tidal action un-
der the deck. The only solution to prevent further leaching was to drive a
sheet pile cut-off curtain wall Immediately along the edge of the concrete
deck. Contracts were prepared, tendered and let for both the remedial
works with the inevitable problems of carrying out this type of work in a
fully operating port. The remedial works were finally completed in early
1984.
Container control which comes under the port manager was never
considered at the time of appraisal since container traffic at that time
was insignificant. It was clearly impossible to effect control from the
remotely located Administration Building and thus a small Container Control
Building was erected adjacent to the container storage area behind berth 4
financed under the project as part of the Administration Building costs.
At the time of appraisal the remaining dredging work and the fil-
ling of the area behind berth 4 was to be carried out by the contractor
responsible for the berth construction. The fill material was obtained by
removing fill from the reclaimed Her Rouge area on the understanding that
it would be replaced by the MK& at a later date using its own dredger.
This has not yet started although the NMA have taken over the-new dredger
financed by the OD[ (UK). MMA is awaiting a crew training programme before
proceeding.
3.03      Implementation Schedule
All of the project items were to have been completed by December
31, 1979 (Table 1). By that date berths 2 to 4 were complete, together
with the two transit sheds and the paving of the cargo and container stack-
ing areas. However work on the other project components had not even
started at that time for the reasons stated in 3.01 above.
It would seem that the original schedule was too short for items
such as the port buildings bearing in mind that the MMA was very newly
formed and was not likely to function as a coherent body for some time and
the complete role of the MMA. in the port was still undefined. For example,
the very recently formed national cargo handling corporation now has its
offices in the IM&'s Administration Building -  a need that was never con-
templated during the conception of the building. In retrospect it is con-
sidered that had the consultants for these buildings been based in Hauri-
tius they would have been better placed to assist MMA and to have guided it
towards its real needs - attempting to give advice at long range from the
UK was impossible.
3.04      Reporting
Reporting was adequate. The engineering consultants prepared
monthly reports on the progress of the civil works and expenditure. The
preparation of statistics on port and cargo operations by the MA steadily
improved as the project progressed to the point where now all the MMA port
statistics are based on the recommended UNCTAD format. The MNA kept up-
to-date statements on the expenditure under the project which were of value
to Bank supervision missions.

3.05      Procurement
No serious procurement problems arose.   ICB was used for all
civil works items with the exception of the container control building and
the remedial iworks to the new berths which were tendered locally.
Procurement related problems which caused some delays and
increased costs were:
(i) the corrugated galvanised steel sheeting to the roofs of the two
transit sheds leaked seriously at the time of the first rainfall
after completion. The problem seems to have stemmed from the
fact that the sheets are of a thinner gauge than normal and no
instructions were received by the contractor from the supplier
indicating that special care was to be taken to avoid foot traf-
fic during erection. The situation was resolved by purchasing
additional sheets and increasing the overlap. It has been neces-
sary since completion to have the roofs of the sheds painted to
control corrosion - in retrospect the specification of galvanised
steel sheeting for a climate such as Mauritius was an error.
(ii) the long delay in letting the contract for the firestation/work-
shop building meant that the materials for the steel frame and
sheeting were left on site in their delivered condition for a
long period of time. When these materials came to be used it was
found that the rusting of the steelwork was such that it had to
be sandblasted and recoated before use and when the steel galvan-
ised sheeting for the roof was commenced it was found that the
condition was so poor that replacement sheeting had to be or-
dered. In the case of both these two items more care by the con-
sultants could have avoided the problems and delays.
(iii) the contractor responsible for the construction of the berths al-
so undertook the dredging of the sea floor immediately in front
of the berths. This dredging was carried out by the contractor
but using the IMMN's barge mounted grab dredge. Under the terms
of the contract the contractor was to use the dredge and recurn
it to the NMA in the same condition as he accepted it. For con-
tractural control the dredge was surveyed prior to use and cer-
tain works carried out to ensure that it was in full working or-
der. However during the work the 'live ring' (a major component)
had to be replaced at considerable cost. It was finally agreed
that this cost could not have been reasonably anticipated by the
contractor and thus he was compensated for this item.
For the remedial works, to save time, the steel sheet piles
needed were tendered on an ICB basis by the MMA using consultants from UK.
The piles were then handed over to the locally tendered successful contrac-
tor.



-8-
3.06    Costs
The completion of the project shows a saving which is largely the
result of the item 'remaining port dredging' not having been fully carried
out. The appraisal estimated a total project cost of US$23.5 million
equivalent, while the actual cost of US$22.8 million equivalent indicates a
savings of US$0.7 mil- lion (Table 2) measured in Nauritian rupees, however, the
cost of the project increased by 8Z over the appraisal estimate of Rs. 151.8
million. In filling the area of sea floor behind the realigned berth 4 and the
rock bunds it was necessary for fill material to be taken from the Her Rouge
area which had recently been reclaimed. This material was removed on the
understanding that the MMA would replace it in due course using its own
equipment and resources since the land of the Her Rouge area was not needed by
the Government for development in the near term. In fact in 1982 the Government
did decide to develop this area as a zone for industry and requested the KMA to
arrange for the whole area of the Her Rouge to be raised to suitable levels and
for the reclamation to be completed. The NA' s engineering consultants were
then appointed to pre- pare tender documents for this work which was to be
funded partly from the project funds and partly by Government. Tenders were
Invited on an ICB basis and tenderers were given the option to make use of the
MMA dredger or to use their own dredging plant - it had been hoped by this
means that a crew training programme could be developed for the MMA dredger.
When the tenders were received it was found on evaluation that the lowest
tenders were with the use of the contractors own plant and more importantly the
costs were very much higher than the consultants estimates. About this time the
Government also decided not to pursue the industrial development zone for the
site and thus the whole scheme was abandoned. The participa- tion of the
project finances in this work would have been limited to the costs of replacing
the volume of filling material initially removed - about 231,000 cubic meters
out of a total volume of 750,000 cubic meters for which the lowest evaluated
tender was 37 million Rupees (the consultants' estimate had been 23 million
Rupees).
The high increase in the costs of the Administration Building and
the Firestation/Workshops was due to numerous changes in the design during
construction and the effects of having to replace much of the steel parts
of the Firestation/Workshop building.  The need to construct a separate
container control building apart from the Administration Building vas also
an escalating factor.
Several devaluations of the Mauritian Rupee took place during the
latter half of the implementation period, This has the effect of increas-
ing the value of the Loans available.

3.07      Performance of consultants, contractors and suppliers
a)    Consultants:
1. Civil engineering consultants: The sane firm of engineering con-
sultants were employed from feasibility study through preparation
of the final accounts. They were originally appointed by the
Government and then later their contract was taken over by the
KM& when this was formed.
The overali performance of the principal consultants was not
considered very satisfactory by the MUA. Their principal causes for
concern were:
i) the consultants did not seem to appreciate that the MMA
was a very newly created body with little experience of
a project of this type and magnitude and with little ex-
perience of dealing with engineering consultants. They
feel that the consultants should have spent much more
time guiding them and advising them of the options
available. This is probably particularly true in the
case of the port firestationlworkshop and the admini-
stration building.
ii) the consultants ran the project from their home office
in Europe and thus even minor changes had to be referred
back to the head office by the resident site staff en-
tailing considerable delay, lack of understanding at
times and considerable costs in telexes and telephone
calls.
iii) the consultants did not seem to appreciate the need for
careful cost control and the MMA feels that their hand-
uing of the vario- -laims submitted by the contractors
for some of the wt items were resolved in a manner
that was not convincingly the least cost.
iv)  it was necessary to carry out remedial works to safe-
guard the stability of the new berths 2, 3 and 4 soon
after the construction was completed and the MMA feels
that there was a fundamental design error which had to
be rectified.
v) the specification of certain materials for inclusion in
structures for a climate such as Mauritius was a mistake
and led to delays and increased costs.
The situation was considered by the Government to be sufficiently
serious that they were contemplating legal action and informally
requested the Bank's assistance but this has apparently been
dropped now.
2. Consultants in Port Management and Cargo Handling/Workshop opera-
tions: Two individual consultants, funded by UNDP, were



- 11 -
appointed to assist the newly created MMA - Mr. Wee Keng Chi for
Port Management and Mr. W. J. Brown for cargo handling. Their
performance was very satisfactory and in the case of Mr. Wee Keng
Chi his services were retained through to 1983 (although on a
short visit basis). Their services were financed by UNDP.
b)     Contractors:
1. The overali performance of aU the civil works contractors on the
project was satisfactory. A list of the contracts and the con-
tractors emviloyed is given in Table 1. It should be noted that
the contractor responsible for the construction of the new berths
2, 3 and 4 was able to gain an early completion bonus as a result
of his performance.
2. The local contractor responsible for the Adiinistration building
maintained a very high standard of construction particularly for
the concrete structure and the complex pre-cast concrete clad-
ding, however, the building took twice as long to complete as
scheduled with very substantial increases in cost.
c)     Suppliers:
The steel structure and the cladding for the transit sheds and
the ffrestationlworkshop buildings was supplied by a UK supplier
which subsequently went out of business.   The roof cladding
leaked excessively on completion and was only resolved following
the purchase of replacement sheets and changing the specification
for attachment.
Other equipment and material suppliers were satisfactory.

IV. Operations and Traffic
Operating Performance
4.01      The port has been operating successfully but the traffic handled
is somewhat below the appraisal estimates as a consequence of reduced sugar
exports and Government measures to reduce imports and spending. Container
traffic has, however, developed much faster then anticipated at appraisal
and steps have already been taken by the MMA to handle this traffic - a
rubber tyred transtainer, tractors and trailers have been procured and the
lands to the rear of berth 4 laid out as a modern container terminal. The
container control building and weighbridge provided under the project comr
plement the facility.
4.02      Port Louis can now claim to be a modern port, adequately equipped
and managed and able to provide good service. However a problem remains to
be resolved - the efficiency and costs of the port labour - which relates
directly to productivity, stevedoring and cargo handling costs and the at-
tractiveness of the port to shipowners.
4.03       The project, the recently constructed bulk sugar loading termi-
nal, the advent of containerisation, Ro-Ro vessels, and increased mechani-
sation have all led to a very substantial excess of port labour. The only
lighterage operations now carried on are for the discharge of bagged rice
which will continue until the proposed new cereal complex becomes opera-
tional when the workers from this operation will also join the port labour
pool and aggravate the situation of overmanning further. There are about
1350 port workers registered who are paid a minimum monthly wage - whereas
about 875 men are needed. Until the recent formation of a national cargo
handling corporation, there was no system of compulsory retirement and thus this
pool of labour imposes a permanent heavy cost on the transit of goods through
the port. The cost situation is worsened by the very low producti- vity of the
port workers in a typical working shift. At present workers are still recruited
for the day's work in the old lighterage port area and then transported by boat
to the new port constructed under the project. Within a very short period after
they have arrived at their work place they break for a meal, and thus it is
hardly worth starting work until after the meal. As a consequence about five
hours work is obtained per eight hour day. The eight hour day is followed by
three hours of overtime during which period the labour productivity per hour is
quite good - however the ship owner must pay for three hours overtime even if
only one is needed.
4.04      The port labour at the time of appraisal was divided among a num-
ber of long established private stevedoring and cargo handling companies
but bound together by a very strong union. During the implementation of the
project the private companies were gradually merged with each other and for the
past few years 'Combined Cargo Handling Services' have carried out all steve-
doring and cargo handling. The Government have been committed for many years to
nationalise the port services but it was only in September 1983 that 'The Cargo
Handling Corporation Limited' was created by the Government as a private
company. The authorized MRs 1 million share capital is held 60Z by the Govern-
ment and 40% by the MMA, The new company has
taken over all the staff and assets of the old private company and is



- 13 -
now faced with the very difficult and delicate task of trying to increase
productivity and reduce both costs and the labour force.  Compulsory re-
tirement is being introduced, recruitment of the labour will now take place
in the new port area and the work timetable is being revised. Various
forms of incentive schemes and double shift working are being considered
that would prove acceptable to the union and the labour. The senior staff
of the CHCL were drawn from the MMA since the management of the CCHS did
not wish to transfer. The Government is paying compensation to the CCHS.
Traffic Development
4.05       Traffic between 1974-80.  The total port traffic projections at
appraisal showed an average annual growth rate of about 4X between 1974-
1980. However, traffic actually declined from 1974 to 1980 by an average
annual rate of about 2.4%, or from 1,897,000 tons to 1,630,000 tons. Ap-
praisal data indicated that total port traffic for 1980 would be divided
almst equally between bagged and bulk cargo (about 41% each); actual data
however, (following the bulk sugar facility operation) indicated that the
largest share of total traffic was attributed to bulk, which represented
72% of the total port traffic, while general cargo represented 18% and bag-
ged cargo rice was only about lOX. Table 3 presents the appraisal forecast
and relates these figures to the actual data. A summary is given below.

4.06      Bulk Traffic. Total bulk traffic for the period 1974-80 was pro-
jected to increase by about 30Z or about 4% per year; however actual data
shows that it increased by aboct  67% or by about 9Z annually.  Total bulk
traffic in 1980 was about one third larger than the appraisal forecast.



- 14 -
4.07      The export category accounted for the largest change in the total
bulk cargo traffic. Exports for 1974-80 were, according to SAR, to in-
crease by about 16% or about 2% annually but increased actually by 10OZ or
12% per year. Although sugar exports made a large contribution to this ca-
tegory, actual sugar exports were 36Z lower than appraisal estimates due to
cyclones Which caused serious damage to the sugar plantations and conse-
quently reduced the output and the volume of sugar exports. Molasses ex-
port volumes in 1980, were only 70% of the appraisal forecast.
4.08        Imports on the other hand increased slightly above appraisal
estimates.  For 1974-80 the projection pointed to an increase of 39Z or
about 6% yearly; however, actual data indicate that it increased by about
44%. Within the import category, cement imports made the largest contribu-
tion to the overall increase. The projection at appraisal was a total in-
crease of 13% or 2% per year; however, it actually increased about two and
a half times. For the year 1980 actual imports of cement reached 279,000
tons, which is an increase of 74% compared with the appraisal estimated of
160,000 tons.
4.09      The project was not designed to affect petroleum products import
traffic.   It should be noted however that SAR estimated an increase in
traffic of about 40% or about 6% p.a. from 1974 to 1980, while actual data
ndicated that traffic decreased by about 9% or about 1.5Z per year for the
above mentioned period. This decline could be attributed to several fac-
tors: a) the reopening of the Suez Canal and reduced need to bunker transit
ships and b) the OPEC agreement to increase the price of oil, which as a
consequence brought about a more energy efficient approach to fuel consump-
tion.  The categories whose consumption was cut down are:  fuel for air-
craft, ships and also for sugar refining.
4.10      General Cargo.  Appraisal projections for general cargo traffic
did not materialize. The appraisal mission indicated for the period 1974-
80 an increase of about 42% or about 6Z yearly; however actual data pointed
to an overall decrease of about 6% or about 1% yearly. For 1980, actual
traffic was 298,000 tons or about 24Z less than projected.
4.11      The decline in the period 1974-80 was almost entirely due to de-
creasing imports.  The appraisal estimated that imports should increase
(between 1974-80) at an annual average growth rate of about 5% but actually
decreased by an annual rate of about 0.5%. The decline took place largely
between the years 1977 and 1980 because of reduced import demands reflect-
ing deteriorating economic conditions in the country.
4.12       General cargo exports (in 1980) reached aparaisal levels, how-
ever, they were insignificant as a share of total port traffic for that
year.   Containerization increased significantly from 1977, and by 1980
about 65% of the general cargo was containerized. Total containerized car-
go increased by almost three and a half times in the period 1977-80. The
development of the containerized cargo cannot be compared with SAR esti-
mates because it was not envisaged at appraisal.
4.13       Bagged Cargo.  Appraisal estimates indicated an increase of 17%
in bagged cargo between 1974-80; however, actual data showed that there was



- 15 -
a decrease of about 83Z. This decrease reflects the switch in 1980 from
bagged to bulk cargo handling of sugar exports, which was not considered at
appraisal.
4.14      Traffic Development from 1980. The appraisal report did not in-
clude overall traffic forecast beyond 1980 except for general cargo rele-
vant to the economic analysis. Actual data on the total port traffic for
1980-82/83 1/ shows that there was a small increase of about 2.5% per an-
num. Bulk traffic had the largest growth rate, about 9% per annum, while
bagged traffic had the largest decrease: -14Z per annum. the decrease of
bagged traffic and the increase in bulk traffic is mostly attributble to
the change in handling of sugar exporLs (from bagged to bulk). Within the
bulk category itself, exports increased by about 12Z per annum, while iI-
ports decreased by about -3% per annum.
4.15      Regarding general cargo traffic, the appraisal estimates did not
materialize. The appraisal report projected an increase of about 12% be-
tween 1980 and 1982. However, actual traffic shows a decrease of about
-4%. The largest discrepancy between projected and actual traffic occured
in 1982, when general cargo traffic reached 285,000 tons, which is about
35Z lower than the appraisal estimate.  Within general cargo traffic, ex-
ports, which in absolute terms make up only one-fifth of the- general cargo
traffic in 1982/83, increased between 1980/81-1982/83 at an average rate of
about 18Z per year; imports, however, having a substantially higher volume
than exports, decreased in the same period by about -6Z annually.
4.16      For the period 1983/84-1986/87, port traffic is estimated to grow
at an annual rate of 2% per year.  For the general cargo, a further small
decline of traffic is anticipated. It is expected, however, that once eco-
uomic recovery in the country begins to develop, the traffic growth will
increase accordingly; a modest annual growth of 2Z thereafter would not be
unrealistic.
4.17      Changes in Handling the Traffic. The SAR foresaw the need to imr-
prove productivity at the port and therefore recommended introduction of a
second shift. In order to test the feasibility and magnitude of the bene-
fits of the second shift, MMu undertook a study in 1982 to estimate the an-
nual throughput capacity for general and containerized cargo in a single
shift operation as compared to a double shift.  The study concluded that
the capacity under double shift would be about 381,000 tons and 24,500
TEUS 2/, while under the single shift it was only about 237,000 tons and
15,000-TEUS; this represents an increase of 60% in tonnage and an increase
of 63% in TEUS. Until now, however, because of high productivity with con-
tainers versus break bulk operations, and the insufficient traffic develop-
ment the second shift has not become essential as yet . The apparently low
occupancy cite' by MM*A (around 50X) implies that port facilities are under-
utilized if the port capacity is calculated on a 24-hour basis, rather than
on operational hours only. However, taking ship time at berth as a propor-
tion of available working hours in the port, the extent of capacity used is
about 70%.
1/ After 1980 the traffic figures correspond to fiscal years.
2/ Twenty foot equivalent containerized unit.



- 16 -
4.18       Overall port productivity is well above the appraisal forecast,
mostly due to changes in shipping technology particularly in ccntaineriza-
tion and bulk handling of sugar (Table 4). In the SAR containerization was
not discussed; however, by 1983 the share of containerized cargo reached
about 7OX of total general cargo traffic. These changes altered the ship
handling procedures in the port. Consequently, emphasis is now placed on
full scale alongside operations for all traffic. This type of operation is
not only faster but less costly.

V. Financial Performance
5.01      The project as revised in 1976 was expected to be completed by
the end of 1976 and the financial forecasts were based on the assumption
that the project facilities would be commissioned and in operation by that
date. The completion of the project having been delayed till the end of
1983, any comparison of the financial estimates at the time of appraisal
with the actual figures will have to be viewed in this context. However,
it should be mentioned that the main berthing and other facilities required
for the operational activities of the port were completed before 1983 and
their utilization did have a favorable impact on the financial transactions
of MMA. Since at the time of appraisal the port operations were a part of
the Marine Department of the Government and only an Income and Expenditure
account was available as part of the government accounts, a forecast bal-
ance sheet of the MMA was not prepared; instead a comparative Statement of
Return on Net Fixed Assets was prepared along with an Income Statement and
a Source and Application of Funds Statement. Accordingly the actual
figures for the years up to 1983 have been compared with the first two
statements. The actual and forecast Income Statement and Return on Fixed
Assets Statement are given in Table 5. In spite of the delay in the com-
pletion of the project and the increase in project costs the MMA has been a
financially viable institution ever since its inception in 1977 and has ac-
cumulated a cash surplus of MRs. 41.3 million by the end of fiscal year
1983 after repaying loans totalling MRs. 36.4 million and meeting invest-
ment expenditures of MRs. 56 million from internal resources.
5.02      With the establishment of the MMA all normal activities associ-
ated with port operations were centralized in one agency. It was
originally envisaged that the actual handliug of cargo -  (loading,
unloading and transhipment) - that was being undertaken by a private
company would also be taken over by the MMA. However, for various
political and social reasons cargo handling operations continued with the
private company - though under the close supervision and control of NKA -
until the establishment of the parastatal CHCL in the latter half of 1983.
Since the MMA was a new organization, various financial conditions were
laid down in the loan agreement to ensure its efficient functioning and
financial viability.  Government was to make an equity contribution of
MRs. 1.6 million by June 30, 1977 and a further MRs. 2.5 million by June
30, 1978. The MMA was to introduce commercial accounting, costing and
budgetary systems by July 1977, restrict its annual investment expenditure,
other than that on the project. to MRs. 2 million, limit its debt
liabilities, introduce a tariff based on cost and market conditions by June
1978 and achieve a rate of return on net fixed assets of not less thar 3%
in 1979, 5% in 1980 to 1982 and 7% thereafter. Commercial accounting was
introduced in 1977 and the first year accounts of the MMA for fiscal year
July 1, 1977 to June 30, 1978 were compiled on that basis. A cost based
tariff was introduced only in 1981 after it was ensured that the commercial
system of accounting was working satisfactorily, the actual direct costs of
the various services rendered by lMA was available and it was possible to
decide on the allocation of the overhead charges on a reasonable basis.
The }}LA also did not strictly adhere to the annual limitation of MRs. 2
million on investment expenditure - the various Bank supervision missions



- 18 -
considered the increased expenditures justified - but the other conditions
regarding debt limitation and return on net fixed assets were fulfilled.
The MMA started operations without the initial equity contribution of MRs.
1.6 million and since its operations turned out to be financially
profitable right from the start there was no need to rely on Government for
financial support.
5.03     MMIAs financial c.ndition is quite sound. Its cash holdings ex-
ceed MRs. 41 million, its receivables and inventories are within reasonable
limit and its debt/equity ratio of 42/100 is acceptable. The establishment
of a new organization for handling cargo effective from October 1983 is a new
development but it is not likely to affect MiA's operations as it is expected to
function, like the old private company, under the supervisory umbrella of the
i2AL. The new organization is set up as a private limited company with the M&A
and the Government as shareholders.

VI. Institutional Performance and Development
6.01      When loan 976-HAS was approved in 1974, the responsibility for
port operations was split amongst various Government agencies. This led to
serious operating difficulties, lack of co-ordination and control, poor use
of the 1imited facilities and poor port efficiency. In addition theft,car-
go damage and losses were excessive. Under the loan the Government agreed
to establish an authority -later known as the Mauritius Marine Authority
(MMA) - to be responsible for all the port's activities except stevedoring
and cargo handling and which would be financially autonomous. Enactment of
the Ports Act No. 30 (1975) took much more time than was forecast and it
was not until July 1, 1976 that the MMA was established and the first board
meeting was July 19, 1976. Although most of the more senior positions in
the MA. were filled, the team lacked cohesive experience and particularly
port experience. Thus a program of technical assistance financed by UNDP
was arranged for port administration, finance and cargo handling. A port
management advisor and a cargo handling advisor were initially appointed
for two years starting in September 1974. The port management advisor
position was continued through to early 1980 and the Cargo kandling advisor
through to April 1978, both at the request of the MMA.. Subsequently the
port management advisor has made two separate missions to the-MMA. to advise
them further and to comment on their progress.
6.02      The effective start-up of the MMA. was slower than anticipated and
there were changes in the positions of Chairman and Director General soon
after which contributed to the slow start. However, the 1MMA is now func-
tioning efficiently and has adequately trained staff in its seaior posi-
tions. There are some gaps which need to be filled as a result of the re-
cent departure of the traffic manager and the transfer of some senior staff
to the Cargo Randling Corporation. The port management advisor was very
effective and his services were well appreciated by the MMA. senior staff.
M*k Management and Organisational Effectiveness
6.03      The quality of tb- MMA's present management is adequate. The
present director general is ne:-1v appointed from his previous position as
financial controller. He assumea >his position on the departure of his
predecessor to become general manager of the CHCL.
6.04      Few changes have been made to the structure of the MNA as origi-
nally conceived. Certain positions have been difficult to fill and will
continue to be i.e. deputy director general, traffic manager, etc. Al-
though the MMA have sufffcient pilots at present, it could be difficult in
the future to recruit and retain sufficient pilots because of the salary
structure. This however is a problem common to many African and Indian
Ocean ports.



- 20 -
6.05      Container control is a function which has had to be added to the
MMA's structure since conception. The service seems to be operating effec-
tively now that the new container control building has been completed and
the staff better housed and located.
6.06      A number of the MMA staff has received traini-ng during the imple-
mentation of the project. A total of 18 staff have received training over-
seas in ports or training institutions for periods from a few weeks to one
year. The types of staff who have received this training vary from crane
operators and workshop managers to the port engineer and financial control-
ler.  The sources of finance for the training have been UNDP/BRMD, British
Government, UNCTAD and UNIDO.
6.07      On-the-job training of !M& port staff was carried out during the
project by the technical assistance experts appointed under the project and
some nine staff received training in this manner.
6.08      Through the port management advisor major improvements have taken
place in the MMA's financial system, management information system, budget-
ary control and other areas. The use of computers for salaries, billing
and port statistics is steadily developing.

VII. Economic Reevaluation
7,01      The development of the port was undertaken to provide modern port
facilities and to replace the old lighterage system. The economic reevalu-
ation was done by comparing the -with- and -without- the project cases.
The construction period of the porc operational facilities was mainly
1974-80 3/, while the quantified benefits, as in the SAR, were the follow-
ing: (i) reduction in ship service time41, (ii) savings in avoiding
lighterage investments, (iii) reduction in cargo handling costs, and (iv)
reductiza in loss and damage to cargo. The calculation of ERR was done in
early 1984 prices with necessary conversion of the construction costs by
using an inflator based on international/local price indices. As in the
SAR, a 25 year economic life 5/ for civil works construction was assumed.
7.02      The project is likely to bring about benefits of a magnitude
not foreseen at appraisal because of the larger impact of the technological
changes in port operations. The principal change in the port operations
which the reevaluation takes into account is containerization of cargo.
However, the new feature makes a comparison with appraisal difficult. The
calculation of benefits is based, as in appraisal, on reduction in ship
service time calculated on the difference between current proAuctivity to
that one prior to the opening of the new berths. There is however, a lack
of sufficient information to estimate more pfecisely the benefits from
changing from lighterage to alongside operations. In addition, savings
made in avoiding lighterage investment were also added (updated estimate of
SAR) and adjusted for the change in traffic volume using the port. It
should also be noted that data on cargo loss and damage reductions were in-
complete; 6/ nevertheless, best estimates were made and appropriately in-
cluded in the recalculation of ERR (Table 6).
7.03      A comparison of project related traffic, between SAR and actual,
indicates that the projections did not materialize. The SAR estimated that
alongside cargo would increase in average at about 1-2Z annually throughout
the economic life. However, taking into account actual traffic data for
1980-82 the traffic was declining by 2% p.a.; on the other hand, MMA pro-
jections for 1984-87 indicate that the traffic is expected to decline in average
by about 6Z annually following more recent economic development. With
anticipated gradual economic recovery in the country, it is plausible to expect
a modest traffic growth thereafter of about 2% per annum. It should also be
noted that the economic reevaluation took into account only the traffic affected
by the project; therefore, bulk cargo (sugar, rice) and petroleum traffic were
not included in the analysis since their facilities have not been included in
the project. That is also comparable to the traffic assumed in the SAR.
3/ The project was completed in 1983; however, project items related
directly to operations of the new port were mostly done by 1980.
41  In the recalculation of ERR only half of these benefits were consi-
dered. It is difficult to assess the magnitude of these benetits ac-
cruable to the country; however, it is plausible to assume that at least
50% of these benefits could be attributed to Mauritius.
5/ Lives of dredging and land reclamation are actually expected to be
longer than 25 years.
61  MKA was unable to provide to the Bank accurate data on the subject.



- 22 -
7.04      Because of modern technologies adopted, average service time for
ships was reduced by about 56% (from 136 to 60 hours) compared with a 40X
reduction estimated at appraisal; this takes into account the change from
lighterage to alongside handling.
7.05      On the basis of inputs summarized in para. 7.01, and actual and
updated traffic forecast (average annual traffic decrease of -2Z for 1980-
82, -6Z for 1983-87 and 2% growth for 1988-2004) the recalculated economic
rate of return (ERR) is about 18Z. However, since the economic life of the
project is expected to last for another 20 years, it is possible that the
estimated benefits may not materialize. In the sensitivity analysis, it is
allowed that the actual benefits may be reduced! under a conservative as-
sumption that the benefits will be reduced by 30Z, the ERR will be about
12% (Table 6) which is still satisfactory compared with the estimated op-
portunity cost of capital of  OZ.  If, however, full estimated value of
benefits in reduction of ship service time were included in the calcula-
tion, the ERR would be 23%. The basic ERR calculated in the SAR is 17%,
dropping to 14% under sensitivity analysis. The ERR recalculated in the
PCR is therefore very close to the one in SAR; this could be explained by
the fact that more efficient handling of cargo not envisaged at appraisal
time and significant reduction in the value of cargo loss and damage due to
alongside containerized operations were offset by reduction in projected
traffic volumes.
Conclusion
7.06       The efficiency in cargo handling has improved substantia7ly and
particularly with container operations which are very efficient though
capital intensive. The decision to construct the third berth although not
justified in traffic terms is well justified in that it has provided the
port with a modern container terminal.  Because of the location of the
transit sheds on the other berths container operations would have been dif-
ficult and less efficient even though with double shift working the same
overall port capacity could probably have been achieved with one less
berth.

VIII * THE ROLE OF THE BANK
8.01      The Bank became involved with this project at an early stage in
its preparation. Although the port master plan had been completed and
accepted by the Government including the consultantst recommendations
concerning the need for the Government to set up a form of port authority,
the Bank was able to provide valuable assistance in the creation of the
institution (the MMA) and to ensure that technical assistance, training and
institution building was provided from the outset.
8.02      Because of the relative inexperience of the senior staff of the
MkA in the management and development of a port they depended heavily on
the advice of the Bank staff during appraisal missions on almost all
aspects of the operations of the MHA including the very sensitive issue of
the creation of a national Cargo Handling Corporation. At completion both
the Government and the MMA expressed their appreciation of the assistance
provided by the Bank staff.
8.03     One of the more important aspects of the Bank's assistance to the WKA
during the implementation of the project was in providing advice on the
management of the MMA's engineering consultants particularly vith regard to the
remedial works that had to be carried out to the new berths. Not surprisingly,
the staff of the MWA had little or no experience of the management of
consultants and large civil works contracts at the outset and although they
gained experience as the project evolved they had to depend on the Bank for
advice when unexpected situations arose.
8.04     The Bank's participation was valuable to Mauritius and the MWA.  The
Bank spent about 62 man-weeks in the project preparation and supervision and the
number and frequency of the supervision missions are considered to be adequate
for a project of this level of complexity.

IX. Conclusions
9.01      Project Justification and Objectives
The project was undoubtedly timely and appropriate. It is unfor-
tunate that the success of the project has been marred by two important is-
sues which could not reasonably have been forecast at the time of
appraisal, i.e.:
(i) The excess of port labour and the poor productivity coupled with
correspondingly high transit costs for cargo.
(ii) The fall in traffic from that forecast as a consequence of the
country's economic position.
The problem of the very strong port labour union and the poor productivity
were known at the time of appraisal but the multi-shift working proposed
for the new berths could not be put into effect. It is hoped that from now
on with the newly formed national Cargo Handling Corporation measures can
be introduced which will resolve this major problem (Annex I). However, the
changes will have to be introduced slowly and very diplomatically to avoid a
conD- frontation with the labour. The ex-director general of the MMA who is now
the General Manager of the CHCL is hopeful of being able to introduce two normal
shift working in the port within a short time.
The other important problem which has been successfully resolved
by the project was the very high level of theft, damages and losses which
occurred with the lighterage operations. A review with the management of
the MMA has shown that losses, theft and damage are now very low, almost at
the point of being negligible.
The new berths have enabled the port to enter the container age
with extreme confidence which has proved to be valuable since the growth of
containerised traffic .'! been very rapid and this was not envisaged at the
time of appraisal. In retrospect it is very fortunate that the design of
the berth layout in the project was amended following the sinking of the
dredger since without this modification there would not have been suffi-
cient back land areas behind berths 3 and 4 for an efficient container ter-
minal.
9.02      Project Content and Scheduling
The results show that the project was sized appropriately and was
not over ambitious, The scheduling of the civil works was satisfactory
with respect to the new berths and the paved areas but the difficulty of
planning the various port buildings with a newly formed MMA was under-esti-
mated. The situation was worsened by the delay in setting up of the MNA
and their initial difficulties with staff changes at management level.



- 25 -
9.03      Project Implementation and Operating Outcomes
The following specific issues 3hould be mentioned:
(i) Project design - the original design concept of the project as
modified after the sinking of the dredger was well conceived.
However the detailed design of certain project components was
poor. In particular the omission of a sheet piled cut-off wall
at the rear of the new berths was an error that had to be recti-
fied during the project with the remedial works contract MH7B,
the specification of galvanised steel sheeting for the cladding
of the various port buildings was unfortunate and the concept of
the port administration building was not really suitable for the
housing of a newly formed organisation in that it lacked flexib_-
lity and ability to expand.
Another simple point that in the future may result in costs to
the MMA but that seemed appropriate at the time of appraisal was
the shaping of the ground levels around the transit sheds which
permits easy loading of trucks at the rear entrance doors. It is
almost certain that as containerisation increases, one of the two
sheds will have to be demolished to increase the open storage
areas adjacent to berth 3 for container handling and this will
require considerable expenditure in relevelling the ground.
(lii) Port Capacity - the capacity of the port is more than adequate
for many years to come and if the proposed cereal complex is com-
pleted which will relieve the new berths from handling bagged
flour in containers then even more capacity will be available.
(iii) Civil works procurement - no real problems arose and some of the
problems that did arise could have been avoided by better speci-
fication by the consulting engineers. The standard of workman-
ship is generally high.

Mr. Yukinovi Watanabe,
Director,
Operations Evaluation Department,
The World Bank,
1818 H Street, N.W.,
WASHINGTON DC 20433.
Dear Mr. Watanabe,
Re: Project Completion Report on Mauritius
Port Project (Loans 976-HAS and 1339T-HAS)
I thank you for your letter dated 11th February,
1985, in respect of the Project Completion Report on Mauritius
Port Project.
We have perused the Report, and our comments are
outlined below:-
A. Section III - Project Implementation and Costs
(1) Delays (Section 3.01)
It is mentioned that there has been excessive
delays in the completion and commissioning
of the projects, and a delay of 4 years is
specified; the main projects, like the two
deep water quays, sheds end back up facili-
ties were completed in 1978, and became opera-
tional in February 1979. The Container
Terminal was commissioned in July 1979; the
Container Control Building sustained a delay
of only one month. The project which was
excessively delayed was the Port Administration
Building, which sustained a delay of 2 years.
(2) Costs (Section 3.06)
There has been two devaluations of the
Mauritian Rupee, one in September 1979 (30Z)
and the other one in October 1981 (20Z).
Although the value of the loans increased in
terms of Mauritian Rupees, the devaluation
have had an adverse impact on the real costs of
the on-going projects, particularly in respat
of imported materials and associated costs.

(3) Performance of Consultants
As a general remark, the performance of the
main Consultant for the project. namely Sir
Alexander Gibb & Partners (Mauritius) has
been to say the least, most unsatisfactory
and well beyond acceptable proportions.
The project for the Container Control Building
had a different Consultant, namely, Limbada
Melvin & Partners, which is a local firm whose
performance has been satisfactory.
(4) Operations and Traffic (Section '.03)
The present port labour force comprises 1,350
employees for an actual requirement of 875.
Section 4.04
Action has already been initiated to increase
the share capital of the Cargo Handling Corpo-
r.ation Ltd. from Rs 1.0m to Rs 10m.
(5) Financial Performance
Section 5.01
The facilities mentioned in the first part
of this letter have, as specified above, been
commissioned before 1993.
Section 5.0Z
The MMA has now, since the 15th February,
19B5, expressed dues payable by vessels in US
dollars.
Section 5.03
The Cargo Handling Corporation Ltd. was
registered as a private company in September
19B3, and became fully operational on the
1st October, 1983.
(6) Economic Revaluation
With the government's agressive policy towards
industrialisation, liberalisation of imports,
complied with this Authority's measures to
promote transhipment activities, it is believed
that the cargo traffic would grow at a modest
rate of 3% p.a. up to 1987, and at a higher rate
thereafter.
(7) Role of the Bank and Conclusions
There is no doubt that the Bank has been of
most invaluable assistance to the MMA and
Mauritius both financially and technically.
Port Louis is now a modern port, with alongside
facilities, including a modern container terminal.
As a result ship's turnround time have been
considerably reduced. The only problem which
./3



AEX 1
_ 35..                     Page 3 of 3
this port still faces is the question of low
productivity. Every effort is now being made
to improve productivity and reduce costs.
As a first measure, a uniform rate is being
introduced for transhipment traffic, i.e. a
consolidated rate comprising MMA and CHC Ltd.
charges reduced by about 60Z of the present
charges, and applicable uniformly during day
and night shifts.
The question of the introduction of a produc-
tivity-oriented system of remuneration, and
double shift is also being actively discussed.
In fact coal vessels (unloaded by port labour
using grabs) are already working round the -clock.
I remain at your disposal for any further clarification.
Yours sincerely,
CJ.H. NAGDAN)
Director-General
