INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO MAURITIUS FOR A PORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Mauritius for the equivalent of US$10.0 million to help finance a port
project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including 5 years of grace,
with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum. The proceeds of the loan would be
relent on the same terms to the National Port Authority (NPA) when it is
established.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report, "Mauritius - 4-Year Development Plan - an Assessment"
(AE-30a) in three volumes, was circulated on November 22, 1972 (R72-240).
A Memorandum on Recent Economic Developments and Prospects (268a-MAS) was
circulated to the Executive Directors on March 13, 1974. Country data are
provided in Annex I.
3.        Mauritius is a small island, densely populated and heavily dependent
on one crop: sugar. For decades, it was considered a typical case of the
vicious circle of underdevelopment: population pressure on land was asso-
ciated with a stagnation of investment and output; the very limited size of
the national market seemed to prevent the establishment of domestic indus-
tries; the vagaries of weather, and the generally unfavorable outlook for
sugar demand at that time, inhibited attempts at increasing production and
reducing unemployment.
4.        The present outlook is much more encouraging, and Mauritius may
soon be viewed as a case of a rapidly developing country which capitalizes
on the availability of cheap labor. After two decades of stagnation,
Mauritius is experiencing rapid economic growth. Family planning programs
have been a major success, and the rate of population growth declined to
1.8 percent in 1972. The Government's effort to create new production and
employment opportunities through the development of export based, labor in-
tensive industries and tourism has achieved an impressive beginning. Sugar
prices have improved, and prospects for future development are favorable.
During 1970-72, real GDP grew by an annual average of 6 percent, while na-
tional income grew by 6.4 percent and 12.5 percent in 1971 and 1972 respec-
tively. The number employed went up by about 15,000 in the last three years,
mostly in industry and tourism, and the rate of investment rose from 16 per-
cent in 1969 to 19 percent in 1972. Though the economy is still heavily
dependent on sugar, manufacturing and services (including tourism) increased
output at a rate of 9 percent per annum, thus contributing close to 30
percent of GDP growth in this period.



5.        In December 1971, tne GovernLment adopted a four-year plan (1971 to 1975)
for social and economic development. The principal objectives as stated in
the plan and modified since are: further development of the sugar industry,
diversification of the economy to create substantial employment, particularly
in export oriented, labor intensive industry and tourism, and the improvement
of training and education, and family planning services. The plan aims at a
GD? growth rate of 7 percent per year and an increase in the rate of investment
to 27 percent in 1975.   This prograr. is well conceived and addresses itself
to the basic production and employment problems faced by the Mauritian economy;
tne Government's performanlce in pursuing those objectives has been impressive.
6.        The diversification of the economy is a primary objective of Mauritius,
both within agriculture and in creation of othier industrial activities. Sugar
still accounts for about 30 percent of national income and over 90 percent of
commodity exports. however, though output increased substantially in 1972 and
1973, and export prices rose by 40 percent, all activities related to sugar
contributed only about 25 percent to the growth of real GDP in the last three
years; the dependence of tlhe economy on sugar is thus being progressively -
though slowly - reduced. Future prospects for diversification within agri-
culture include the development of groundnuts, vegetables and traditional
crops like ginger, and a livestock industry based on sugar cane by-products.
Outside agriculture, immediate possibilities for diversification are in
manufacturing and tourism.
7.        Absorptive capacity and availability of financial resources are
bota possible constraints to economic development. hiowever, the steps taken
by the 'lauritians in establishing new institutions and improving existing
developmental institutions, such as a planning office and a development bank,
in mobilizing external technical assistance and in training MIauritians, would
indicate that absorptive capacity is not likely to be a serious impediment
to growtn.  Otlher constraints, particularly financial constraints, might
operate before absorptive capacity comes into play.
8.        Hitherto, development has been financed mostly from domestic re-
sources and in thiis regard botlh domestic policies and the improvement in the
international sugar price have made effective contributions.    In 1972, the
domestic savings rate was 22 percent as compared to the investment rate of
19 percent. This rate of savings was made possible because (a) the salary
structure of civil servants was frozen from 1968 to 1971, thus permitting
some Goveniment savings; (b) wages in the sugar sector did not follow the
improvement in sugar prices; (c) price stability encouraged private saving.
9.        There lias in receint monthis been pressure on the public and private
sectors to distribute the gains of economic improvement more equitably.
1artly as a measure to retain and attract skilled and qualified people to
Government and partly as a redistributive measure, public sector salaries
were increased oni tlhe average by 30 percent in 1973.  There has been a
similar increase in wages in the private sector.    Though some increases in
wage-s were >istifiUd, the magnitude was such that inflationary pressures
resulted. Consumer prices rose by 18 percent between October 1972 and October
1973, and merchandise imports increased by about 30 percent. The current



- 3 -
account of the balance of payments showed no surplus in 1973, as compared to
a surplus of about $15.0 million in 1972. The Government has taken a number
of anti-inflationary measures to restrict the level of aggregate demand.
INew taxes have been introduced, adding about 10 percent to Government current
revenues, and credit restrictions have been imposed.
10.       The question of income distribution will remain central in the
future. The recent economic expansion has been accompanied by a relative
deterioration in the share of wages and salaries in national income. They
accounted for 53 percent of GNP in 1972 as compared to 59 percent in 1968.
It is, however, almost inevitable in the early phases of a sharp upswing
in the price of sugar, in an economy so heavily dependent on this commodity,
that the share of wages and salaries in the national income should experi-
ence a decline. The distribution of investments and the Government's fiscal
policies will play a crucial role. Insofar as future investments emphasize
the creation of new job opportunities, the income distribution situation
should improve. However, Mauritius, long with many other developing coun-
tries, has features in its economic policy which discriminate in favor of
capital intensive techniques, including low interest rates, favorable depre-
ciation rules and generous tax exemptions. Future economic policy will need
not only to focus on continued high rates of domestic savings to finance
investments to benefit a large number of people, but also to correct some
of the biases which favor capital intensity.
11.       The contribution of capital inflows in supplementing the domestic
savings effort has been modest. Over the four years since Independence
(1969-72), annual gross public capital inflow averaged US$3.8 million, of
which $1.7 million was in grant form and $2.1 million in loans. In 1969-70
and 1970-71, Mauritius also made use of about US$2.7 million of SDRs each
year. The U.K. has provided over 91 percent of grant funds and 84 percent
of the loans. The U.S., Australia, the European Economic Community and the
World Food Program have been the other contributors of grant aid, principally
in the form of food, while IDA has been the source of the remaining 16 percent
of loans. In addition, there has been a recorded annual private capital
inflow averaging US$1.2 million over the same four-year period. There are
indications, however, that until quite recently there was in fact a net out-
flow, of private capital, not recorded in the balance of payments figures. In
future there will be a substantial need for external assistance if Mauritius
is to ensure long-term social and economic development through the intended
step-up in investment levels.
12.       Official foreign exchange reserves went up from US$13 million to
US$67 million between the end of 1967 and the end of 1973. This is equivalent
to about 6 months of imports. Recent petroleum price increases are expected
to add about US$9 million per year to the import bill, but with the expected
capital inflow and good prospects for exports in the coming years, reserves
should still rise despite the expected increase in imports required for the
investment program. At the end of 1972 external public debt was $29.7 million,
of which the bank Group share represented about 21.5 percent. Service payments



- 4 -
amounted to S3.0 mAillion (of whicih about one fifth was to the Bank Group),
equivalent to 2.1 percent of foreign exchange earnings during the year.
Given satisfactory economic performance and not unfavorable developments in
sugar prices, Mauritius should be able to service a limited amount of con-
ventional borrowing without the debt burden exceeding manageable limits.
PART II - BANiK GROUT OPERAT IONS
13.       The Bank made a loan of US$7 million to Iauritius in 1963 for a
power project, before the island gained independence in 1968. This loan,
guaranteed by the United Kingdom, nas been fully disbursed.  Since independence,
four IDA credits totalling US$16.7 mlillion hlave been made, one for agriculture
in April 1971 (US$5.2 million - Tea Development Authority), two for industrial
development in June 1972 (US$3.5 million - Development Bank of Mauritius) and
in June 1973 (US$4K1 million - Industrial Estates), and one for rural develop-
ment in July 1973 (US$4.0 million). IFC made a loan of US$600,000 in June
1971 for the construction of two beach notels. Annex II contains a summary
statement of the Bank loan, IDA credits and IFC investments, as of February 28,
1974, as well as notes on tihe execution of ongoing projects.  Except for the
tea project, which is facing certain problems, described in greated detail
in Annex II, project execution has been excellent.
14.       As can be seen from the analysis in Part I above, Mauritius'
prospects are quite favorable for both growth potential and balance of
paymrents. Debt service is low at present and is 1lot expected to exceed 12%
of projected export earnings in 1985, even assuming a substantial rise in
borrowing     on somewhat harder terms. Wfe believe that NTauritius is now
creditworthy for a limited amount of Bank lending and are therefore recommend-
ing that the proposed project be financed with Bank funds.  This would be the
first Bank loan to lauritius since independence. In thte next few years we
intend to continuc making a moderate amount of Bank funds available, the
volume of which would of course be subject to continued review of thae econonmic
situation and outlook. Iiowever, Mauritius will continue to require external
finoncing on concessionary terms and the lending program envisages a blend of
ank anmd IDA assistance. Thie 1Bank Croin share inL debt and debt service is
expccted to increase to about 25% by 19Db.
15.      The program for Bank Group lending reflects the priorities of the
Governmernt in promotinig economic diversification and creating employment
outside sugar. The proposed project would be the first Bank Group lending
operation in the transport sector. Its Primary objective would be to facili-
tate tuie efficient handling of increasing general cargo traffic and to help
seL up an efficient organization tc manage the port's operationls.  A second
loan to the bcvelopmenc hank of 14auritius (DIhM) will be presented to the Board
shortly.  FurLtter :irojects currently uLnder preparation are designed to expand
infrastructure Facilities, stich as water supply and possibly power, in order
to avoid constraints oni future industrial growth, and to assist I4Iauritius in
the development of education and training. Furtiher assistance will also be
provided for agricultture, probably alonig the lines of the recent rural devel-
opment project.

PART III - TlIANSPORT IS MAURITIUS
The Transport Sector
16.       Mauritius has a well developed transport system consisting of a
comprehensive network of roads, one airport and one commercial port. Internal
transport is entirely by road; a railway system (62 miles) was phased out in
the mid-1960s. All major centers on the island are connected by paved roads.
out of a total of over 870 miles of road, about 610 miles have a bituminous
surface. The total road density of 1.2 miles per square mile is one of the
highest in the world. A 10 mile expressway, south of Port Louis, has recently
been completed and major road construction projects currently under study
include a second expressway extending north from Port Louis and the inter-
connection of both expressways in Port Louis itself.
17.       The airport serving Mauritius is located at the southeastern tip of
the island.  Aircraft movements have increased significantly from 735 in 1961
to about 2,600 in 1972, reflecting both increased tourism and the island's
strategic location as a refuelling stop on the Africa/Australia route. Al-
though the airport was modernized in recent years to accommodate jet aircraft,
the Government is currently considering the construction of a new airport in
the northeast, since the location of the present airport restricts jet aircraft
movements, especially at night and in adverse weather conditions.
18.       Ocean shipping remains the most important transportation mode to and
from the island and all imports and exports are shipped through Port Louis,
the country's only deep-water commercial iharbor. Consumer goods, cereals,
cement and petroleum products are the main imports while sugar is the largest
expert commodity. A harbor at Grant Port in the southeast was built as a
bunkering terminal in World War II but was never used, and serves no commercial
shipping today, because of its exposure to the southeast tradewinds and storms.
19.       The existing transport modes complement rather than compete with one
another and transport coordination is therefore not a major issue. Planning
in transport, as in other sectors, is the responsibility of the Economic
Planning Unit in the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development. The var-
ious Ministries responsible for implementing transport projects have not had
adequate capacity to meet the ambitious targets established in the 1971-1975
Development Plan and the program has therefore slipped considerably. Imple-
mentation is, however, expected to improve during the remaining plan period.
The l{arbor of Port Louis
20.       Port Louis is an excellent well sheltered natural harbor, located
in the northwest. The seaward approach is a 600 foot wide, 1-1/2 mile long
channel, with a water depth of 32 feet, suitable for general cargo vessels and
bulk carriers of up to about 18,000 DWT. The harbor, which is virtually free
of siltation, comprises a main basin with a water area of 320 acres and two
small adjacent basins of 22 and 8 acres respectively. The port is predominantly



for iighterage with 15 mooring buoys.   Ocean-going general cargo is lightered
to and from public lighterage quays. Sugar, the port's largest tonnage
commcdity, is taken by lighter from tne sugar stores of the dock companies to
the vessels in the stream. There are two deep water alongside quays used mainly
for bulk cargoes, a submarine pipeline for petroleum products and a timber
jetty where bulk cement is unloaded.   A dredging scheme financed by the U.K.
Overseas Development Administration (ODA) is now underway. It will accelerate
and complete the reclamation of some 220 acres of land at 11er Rouge, adjacent
to the port, for industrial development, by December 1974. This dredging will
provide a 40 foot water depth in most of the harbor.
21.       In 1972, the port handled a total of 1.7 million torns of ca:-go of
all LIypes, comprising 670,000 tons of sugar, 520,000 tons of general and
bagged cargo and 510,000 tons of bulk liquids and cement.   The total labor
force employed is about 3,500. The harbor facilities at Port Louis are be-
coming increasingly congested and are inadequate to handle the anticipated
growth in traffic.
22.       Tht? Mlarine Services Department of the Mlinistry of Communications
is responsibie for pilotage, ship towage, dredging, navigational aids, and
maintenance of buoys and thie enforcement of harbor and safety regulations.
Other Government departments, such as Customs, Police, Treasury, Lands and
Public Works also have jurisdiction over and responsibilities for various
port functions. The present division of responsibilities and lack of overall
control has resulted in serious difficulties in operation and has materially
reduced port efficiency. Cargo pilferage and damage are high and storage
space is inadequately utilized.   There has been no systematic planning for
the future operation, organization and development of the port, and financial
and cost controls are inadequate. In an effort to alleviate these problems,
the Government has decided to create a National Port Authority (NPA) which
would be responsible for all aspects of port administration, operations and
finance withi such powers, responsibilities, organization, resources, financial
structure and policies as shall be mutually satisfactory to the Goverament
and tie Bank (see below, paragraph 27).
PAR' IV - ThE PROJECT
23,       A report entitled, "Mauritius - Appraisal of a Port Project"
(No. 318 a-HAS), dated Marchi 15, 1974, is being circulated separately to
the Lxecutive Directors.   A credit and project summary is provided in Annex
ill, and the transport system and port facilities are shown on the attached
map (No. IBR0 3029).
'4.       'the project was appraised in the field in June and October 1973.
.Jegotiations were held in Washington from February 19 to February 20, 1974.
Ihe .lauritian delegation was led by Mr. R. Pyndian, Financial Secretary.



-7-
the Project
25.       An ODA-financed study of Port Louis' long-term development, undertaken
by Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, was completed in February 1973. The con-
sultants' recommendations were generally accepted by the Government and the
proposed project would cover a first phase of the long-term plan.
26.       The proposed project would expand and improve the harbor of Port Louis
by providing improved facilities and equipment, and through technical assist-
ance in port administration, accounting and operations. The project would
consist of the following:
(a) construction of three deep-water berths, a small
jetty, mooring dolphins, sheds and administrative and
workshop buildings, together with consultants' services
for engineering and supervision of construction;
(b) purchase of cargo handling equipment and tugs;
(c) completion of the port dredging program; and
(d) technical assistance to the NPA in port administration,
accounting and operations.
Project Implementation
27.       The Ministry of Communications will be responsible for project execu-
tion until creation of NPA in late 1974, at which time NPA will take over
this responsibility. NPA is to be managed by a chief executive officer with
full control over day-to-day operations and responsible to a Board which
would determine general policy. The Ministry of Communications, and subsequent-
ly NPA, is to be assisted by consultants to complete engineering, to prepare
bidding documents and to supervise construction. The project would also
include technical assistance in administration, finance and cargo handling
operations to create and develop an efficient and financially viable port
organization. Two port advisors financed by the UNDP with the Bank as
executing agency, would assist the NPA in introducing modern commercial
accounting, costing and budgetary control systems. They would also assist
the NPA in establishing a system for the selection, training and development
of staff which would ensure the NPA of the availability of qualified and
experienced staff at all levels. These advisers will be in the field not
later than September 1, 1974.
28.       In order to minimize the port's capital investment in the unlikely
event that the economy suffers a setback during the next two years, the
third berth will onl) be constructed if the need is confirmed by actual traf-
fic developments through 1975. The Government and the Bank will determine



hy >;arch 1, i976, wh-ether to proceed with the construction of this berth.
To safeguard the harber against adverse effects from future reclamation or
other works, the Government has agreed not to make any offshore physical
changes which would impair the port's effectiveness.
Project Costs and Financi,
29.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$16.1 million
equivalent (including about US$0.5 million for import duties arid taxes) with
a foreign exchange component of US$12.1 million, or 75 percent of total
coE;ts.  Project costs will be met bv contributions from the Bank, the UNDP,
ODA and internally generated funds as follows:
US$ Million Equivalent
Local     Foreign    Total     %
IBRD                          0        10.00   10.00    62%
UNDP                          0         0.12    0.12     1%
ODA                        0.59         1.65    2.24    14%
Internal cash generation   3.41        0.35     3.76    23%
4.00        12.12   16.12   100
30.       The proposed Bank loan of US$10.0 million would finance about 80
percent of the foreign exchange costs, and would cover the foreign costs of
construction, including engineering and supervision by consultants. A UNDP
grant of US$120,000 would finance the foreign costs of technical assistance,
while on ODA loan of $2.24 million would cover the cost of dredging, a re-
placement tug and cargo handling equipment.    The remaining project costs
totalling $3.76 million would be financed by the NPA out of its own resources.
The ODA loan is repayable over 20 years at 7 percent interest per annum.
The biank loan of $10.0 million would be made to Mauritius, and would have a
term of 25 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent
per annum. Tihe Government agreed to onlend to N4PA on similar-terms, with
NPA bearing the foreigin exchange risks.
31.       Since detailed engineering is expected to start in March 1974, it
is proposed that about US$100,000 in foreign costs be financed retroactively
under the proposed Bank loan.
Procurement and Disbursement
32.       Bank-financed contracts would be awarded to pre-qualified contractors
after international competitive biddinig in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines.
Separate contracts are anticipated for the wharves-and the cement pier, shed
steel structures, shed erection, and other buildings and asphalting.    Though
local contractors do not have the capability of undertaking the major civil
works, they are expected to be awarded the contracts or sub-contracts for
building, pavements etc. Disbursements from the loan would be on the basis
of 77 percent of expenditures for civil works and actual foreign exchange
costs for engineering consultants' services.



-9-
Financial Aspects of Port Administration
33.       Revenues from port operations produced a rate of return of 7.1
percent in 1972 and 8.3 percent in 1973. Although these results were
satisfactory, there were no debt servicc charges during this period.
34.       The port's tariffs have not been modified since 1967 and at current
levels would be inadequate to enable NPA to meet operating expenses, service
its debt (including the Bank and ODA loans) and finance a reasonable part of
the port's investment needs. In addition, the current tariff structure does
not reflect the cost of the services provided. The Borrower has agreed that,
at the end of NPA's first year of operations, a tariff revision would be
undertaken that would ensure adequate revenues while relating the tariff
structure to cost and market factors. These measures should enable NPA to
achieve an annual rate of return on net fixed assets in use of not less than
8 percent in 1976 and 1977, and 7 percent in 1978 and thereafter; current
projections indicate that tariff increases which would raise revenues by 15
percent in 1976 and by an additional 20 percent in 1978 would be required.
In addition, the Borrower agreed that ,PA would not incur any further debt
if its cash revenue for the fiscal year or the 12 consecutive months imme-
diately before, whichever is greater, were less than 1.5 times the maximum
debt service requirement in subsequent fiscal years, and that except as is
otherwise agreed with the Bank, it would limit investments to those included
in the project up to the closing date of the proposed loan, except for small
items not exceeding in the aggregate Rs. 1 million per annum.
Economic Benefits and Rate of Return
35.       The project will result in lower cargo handling costs at Port Louis
and will shorten the average service time of ships. It will also reduce
cargo losses due to damage and pilferage. It will enable Mauritius to cope
with the anticipated growth in traffic of 6 percent a year and is expected
to result in a small increase in employment. The economic rate of return
on the project is 17 percent. The sensitivity of this return was tested
by assuming that the construction cost was increased by 15 percent and the
benefits were reduced by 15 percent. Under these assumptions, the economic
return remains satisfactory at 14 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The Loan Agreement between Manuritius and the Bank, the recommenda-
tions of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 10 -
37.       The special features described in paragraphs 27 and 28 of this
Report are reflected in Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, and 4.11 of the Loan
Agreement. The arrangements relating to the relending of the proceeds of
the loan to NPA after it has been established are dealt with in Section
3.05 of the Loan Agreement.
38.       I am satisfied that thre proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of the Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
39.       In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take full
account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. however,
available information indicates that the proposed loan remains fully justified.
4u.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit 239-MAS -    Mauritius Tea Development Authority Project:    $5.3 million
Credit of April 9, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977:
This project constitutes the second phase of Mauritius'
tea development program.   Project field development is satisfactory, but the
Mauritius tea industry has experienced a nLmber of problems.    These result
firstly from the deteriorat-ling world market prices which, combined with in-
creases in cost of labor, make the production of tea less favorable than ex-
pected at appraisal, and secondly from the reluctance of labor to work in
the rather isolated and damp tea growing area. The total area to be devel-
oped under the project has been reduced from 5,000 to 3,000 acres: this in
turn has reduced the factory requirements during the project period. Despite
this reduction, project costs are estimated to be some 25 percent above ap-
praisal estimates. Although prospects for the next five years are somewhat
brighter, since Mauritius has succeeded in making arrangements to sell most
of its tea production, the Government has decided to undertake shortly a com-
prehensive review of the future of the tea industry.
Credit 313-MAS -     Development Bank of Mauritius Project; $3.5 million Credit
of June 23, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1976:
As of February 28, 1974, projects amounting to $1.9
million had been approved. As a result of the rapid growth of industrializa-
tion, all funds are expected to be committed ahead of schedule.
Credit 411-MAS -     Industrial Estate Project; $4tpmillion Credit of June 29,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1980:
This credit became effective on October 1, 1973. Construc-
tion work began in July 1973 and is proceeding ahead of schedule.
Credit 419-MAS -    Rural Development Project; $4.0 million Credit of July 9,
1973; Closing Date: February 29, 1976:
This credit became effective on October 11, 1973. Work
began in July 1973 and is progressing satisfactorily.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
thie progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution,
