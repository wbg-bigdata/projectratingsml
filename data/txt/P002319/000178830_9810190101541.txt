REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY'
Borrower:         Republic of Senegal
Amount:           SDR 20.4 million (US$21.5 million equivalent)
Terms:            Standard
Project
Description:   The primary project objective is to assist the Senegalese
Government to carry out urgently needed maintenance
operations on its road network so as to avoid a severe
deterioration of the network. Related objectives are to keep
an adequate balance between maintenance and new road
construction and to further improve the efficiency of the
road maintenance organization already strengthened under
earlier Bank Group operations, including the decentralized
financial and cost accounting systems, and planning and
monitoring of maintenance activities. The project would
support the Directorate of Road Maintenance and Equipment's
program over the four-year period 1983/84-1986/87 as
follows: (a) routine maintenance of about 9,100 km of roads
in the first year, increasing to about 10,500 km by the
fourth year, including maintenance of feeder roads; (b)
periodic maintenance (repaving and regravelling of road
surfaces and rehabilitation of structures) as warranted on
roads maintained under (a) above; and (c) deferred periodic
maintenance of other paved and gravel roads neglected in
recent years because of the Government's inability to
adequately fund the necessary operations. The project would
also increase the use of regional revolving funds to promote
local administration.  In the spirit of the Special
Assistance Program (SAP) disbursements would be substantially
front-loaded.
Benefits and
Risks:         The project would yield high benefits and economic returns to
Senegal by delaying the need for new investments in
rehabilitation works and by allowing reduced vehicle
operating costs, with a consequen-tial overall positive effect
on the balance of payments. This latter result is
particularly significant at a time when Senegal, after making
good progress in recent years in building up the operating
performance of its maintenance organization to the point
where it has become one of the most efficient in West Africa,
now finds itself unable to sustain this progress because of
its very tight budgetary situation.



There are no major risks arising from the institutional
arrangements for project execution. There is, however, a
risk that the Government's budgetary situation may not
improve sufficiently over the project period to enable it to
assume an increasing responsibility for financing maintenance
operations. If this were the case, external assistance would
continue to be sought as a priority to ensure an adequate
level of maintenance operations. The adequacy of financing
will be carefully considered by Government and IDA during a
detailed mid-term review of the status of project
implementation and its financing.

FY87. Further external support f'or the latter years is being
sought; however, if funds remain insufficient, program and

FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Senegal has a fairly well developed transport system concentrated in
the Cap Vert peninsula and the groundnut basin, which are the areas with the
largest populations and economic activity. The transport system comprises a
1,032 km railway, 14,000 km of roads including 3,500 km paved; a deepwater,
protected port at Dakar and three secondary ports; and an international
airport at Dakar and a network of smaller domestic airports.
1.02     Some 95% of all domestic transport in Senegal is done by road.
Senegal's road network (Annex 1-1) forms the densest paved network in West
Africa; over the last 10 years, with relatively impressive investments, the
road network has also become one of the best in West Africa: paved roads
increased from some 2,250 km to 3,500 km, and all weather gravel roads
increased from some 2,300 km to 5,500 km. Some 20% of the paved roads are
less than 5 years old and 40% less than 10 years. This compares to 4,000 km of
paved roads in Ivory Coast and 2,000 km in Cameroon, which have GNPs four and
two times respectively the size of Senegal's, and larger land areas. In
parallel, the vehicle fleet has increased to some 65,000 units at about 7%
p.a., and used some 7% more fuel every year. Some 80% of the car fleet and
60% of other vehicles are based in Dakar, where about 75% of all traffic
originates or terminates; on the most heavily used road section, joining Dakar
to the rest of the country through the Cap Vert peninsula, traffic has reached
some 18,000 vpd. The importance of preserving the network and keeping vehicle
operating costs to a minimum are illustrated by the fact that no less than 900
million vehicle-km are run per year.
1.03     Given that Senegal has a well developed transport network and that
the economy is in a critical situation which does not generate a surplus for
investments or create additional demand for services, the first objective is
to make the best with what exists, i.e., to maintain assets and improve the
efficiency of the system, so that use of scarce available resources can be
improved. It is evident that there is scope for improving efficiency and
reducing the Government's recurrent budget requirements over the medium-term.
1.04     The institutional capacity for road maintenance has already improved
since the early seventies; Annex 1-2 shows the evolution of the network
maintained, and Annex 1-3, related expenditures and unit costs since 1976/7.
Over that period, however, priority was given to new investments over main-
tenance, and many roads were paved despite their carrying less than 100 vpd;
road investments absorbed some CFAF 9 billion per year during 1978-80.



1.05     For 1979, as part of its overall policy to streamline investments in
the transport sector, the Government announced that it would give priority to
road maintenance over new construction. Its Road Fund was thereafter to be
exclusively used to finance maintenance of the classified network while new
investments and debt services were to be financed by the Equipment Budget and
the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement, respectively. The Government pledged and
agreed under a covenant of the Fourth Highway Project to budget CFAF 3 billion
per year for the Road Fund (RF), and to delegate CFAF 700 million to the
revolving funds of the regional and central Directorate of Road Maintenance
and Equipment (DERM) offices, to cover operational expenditures for
maintenance. The new RF concept and revolving funds were operative for the
first time in 1980. With the exception of salaries of permanent staff, which
are paid under the operating budget, all road maintenance expenditures,
including salaries of temporary staff, purchases of equipment, spares, fuels,
and materials, and payments to contractors for maintenance works are handled
under the Road Fund. The new funding concept was to have ensured the con-
tinued availability of funds throughout the road maintenance system, and thus
remove one of the main obstacles to efficiency in work.
1.06     However, a prolonged and grave shortage of Government funds resulted
in the Road Fund being seriously curtailed in the following years. In FY81
the Road Fund was provided with CFAF 2.5 billion, still below the target, of
which some CFAF 600 million were counterpart fundls for pavement strengthening.
In FY82, the Road Fund allocation was CFAF 1.9 billion; amounts actually
spent were even inferior to this: only about CFAF 1 billion, because funds
were released with considerable delays and could not be transferred between
fiscal years. (The FY82 Road Fund budget was onLy finalized in February 1982
and released in April, after no less than eight changes in as many months).
Whereas stocks of spares, fuels and materials carried over from the preceding
fiscal year did permit a reduced maintenance effort for some time, complete
work stoppage occurred for four months in early 1982, and most of the main-
tenance budget was spent on unproductive salaries as staff did not have the
means to work with. In FY83, the Road Fund allocation for maintenance was
reduced to CFAF 1.8 billion, but liquidity improved and there were no work
stoppages due to lack of funds. In FY84, actually available allocation for
road maintenance is around CFAF 1.1 billion. During these years of shortage
of Government funds, the general budget was in general maintained intact, with
salaries of permanent staff paid on time--while the reductions were applied to
salaries of temporary staff, and mostly to purchase of supplies. The Govern-
ment also became seriously remiss in payments of counterpart funds to contrac-
tors under the Bank/IDA-financed Fourth Highway Project. During negotiations,
the Government and the Association agreed on a payment schedule for these
counterpart funds owed by the Government to contractors; albeit belatedly,
these payments have now been made.
1.07     Revenues from road user charges amount to far more than the combined
expenditures on road investments and maintenance. Although, by decree, the
Road Fund should receive 50% of refinery fuel taxes, this has not been applied
due to the insolvency of the Treasury, and all revenues from road user charges
have been used for general purposes. Fuel taxes alone, which represent about
50% of the sale price, would generate some CFAF 25 billion per year
(Annex 1-4). It does not seem warranted to increase taxes even further,



- 3 -
although an axle-load tax for trucks may be required to properly assign
maintenance expenditures to heavy vehicles; this is in the process of being
addressed by the Government with assistance to be provided under the
Fourth Highway Project.
1.08     In this context, the Government requested donor support for the Road
Fund. In March 1982, a sectoral aid coordination meeting was held at which
the Bank indicated its willingness to support road maintenance in view of
Senegal's difficult economic circumstances and the! good cooperation between
the Government and the Bank in the sector. The Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (CCE, France), also pledged its support for construction and
maintenance of feeder roads, under French exceptional aid. As a result, the
CCCE provided emergency aid in the amount of CFAF 500 million for FY82.  USAID
also adopted a positive attitude towards supporting the country's road
maintenance effort. It has since allocated US$5 million under its FY83
Economic Support Fund to finance maintenance costs of rural roads in areas
where it is supporting agricultural projects; some local funds generated from
this support are expected to be used for road maintenance during FY84 and
FY85. USAID is further considering a US$10 million support for road
maintenance in FY86 and FY87.
1.09     The Bank Group has had quite a heavy involvement, summarized in Annex
1-5, in Senegal's transport sector, with a total of twelve projects approved
since 1966. Sector issues and investment programs have been discussed between
the Bank and the Government in connection with the preparation of a national
transport plan by the Ministry of Equipment assisted by consultants under the
Third Highway Project, and in the context or a 1982 Bank Transport Sector
Memorandum. The most important issues are the funding of road maintenance and
the role and performance of Senegal Railways. The railway is shortly to be
subjected to a detailed study of its operations and efficiency. In the four
highway projects approved so far, improvements to road maintenance organiza-
tion and execution have featured prominently, and have on the whole been more
successful than similar efforts in other West African countries. The ongoing
Fourth Highway Project provides for pavement strengthening, studies and a
training program for maintenance staff. The proposed Project would address
the problem of maintenance funding, and would be the thirteenth Bank Group
Project in the tranport sector.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
2.01     While the ongoing Fourth Highway Project provides funds for the
strengthening of paved roads and training for road maintenance staff, and
several sources cover feeder road financing needs, the highest return
activity--maintenance--has insufficient financing available. The main purpose
of the proposed project is thus to avoid that the road network deteriorates
for lack of maintenance requiring subsequent rehabilitation at far higher cost
than timely maintenance. Through involvement in these activities, a second
objective is to further improve efficiency in the physical operations, uses of



- 4 -
funds and monitoring and control. These institutional developments would also
improve later use of Government's own funds.
B. Description
2.02     The Project consists of a 4-year time slice of the road maintenance
program of the Directorate of Road Maintenance and Equipment (DERM) in the
General Directorate of Public Works (DGTP). The effort to be undertaken under
the program would prevent further deterioration of the paved network, and
through the execution of deferred maintenance, return the gravel network to at
least the average quality that it had in the late 1970s. The work program
(summarized in Annex 2-1) will consist of:
(a) routine maintenance of 9,100 km of roads in the first year rising to
about 10,500 km in the fourth year, including the extension of proper
maintenance to the feeder road network;
(b) periodic maintenance (repaving and regravelling of road surfaces, and
repair of structures) as warranted on the maintained network;
(c) deferred periodic maintenance of paved and gravel roads not carried
out in a timely fashion because of the funding problems in recent
years.
2.03     To this end, the DERM will continue:
(a) to plan yearly work programs in accordarnce with practices established
under the Third Highway Project and to improve such practices where
required;
(b) to operate about 60 field brigades for carrying out all routine
maintenance and part of the periodic maintenance (regravelling);
(c) to sub-contract remaining periodic and deferred maintenance (repaving
and regravelling);
(d) to ensure the timely renewal of DERM road maintenance equipment;
(e) to complete the modernization of central and regional workshops, and
to adequately maintain the brigades' equipment;
(f) to maintain and improve the financial and cost accounting systems;
(g) to carry out yearly audits of all road maintenance operations and
related activities.
2.04     The Ministry of Equipment's eight regional DGTP offices will carry
out force account works for routine and periodic maintenance, while their
initial work programs will be consolidated, and subsequently monitored, by the
Central DERM. DERM headquarters will also deal d:irectly with large periodic
maintenance contracts. DERM is able to carry out the Project, as can be seen
in Chapter III. There are at present a total of 60 brigades that can be
mobilized, if they are given operating funds and supplies.



2.05     In the first year of the program, routine maintenance will concen-
trate on the paved network and that part of the gravel/earth network which is
in condition "fair" or better. The work consists of spot repairs to asphalt
and gravel surfaces, grading of gravel and earth surfaces, cleaning of ditches
and drainage structures, and upkeep of road signs and markings.  For road
sections listed in bad or poor conditions this type of work does not yield
much result, and full scale routine maintenance will only be resumed afteg
deferred maintenance work has been completed.
2.06     Routine maintenance work is presently predominantly mechanete  Ci
the average of 8 teams and brigades assigned to each region, 5 are
field teams (for grading, regravelling, surface patching, etc), 2 a-r labo
teams (hand cleaning and masonry repair), and 1 is a mechanized auri:i[4%
brigade.  During the Project period, routine maintenance coveMge, of t4&
work will increase from 4,500 km to 6,700 km for gravel roads  n
km to 3,800 km for paved roads. At the end of the period th6re-.4i15
be a coverage of about 70% of the earth/gravel network and
one.
2.07     Periodic maintenance work consists in resotoi'
design condition after a period (usually 4-5 years for
years for paved roads) in which routine maintenance ahs d
levels of roads, but in which wearing courses age a-nd wear- aojt. '
covers resealing an entire paved surface, regravelling a gravel re             -
original wearing course thickness, and rehabilitating drainagwe 4tru3i4rjMw;
2.08     Deferred maintenance is required for those sections that have,
through lack of routine and/or periodic maintenance, deteriorated to a state
where resumption of regular maintenance activities no longer is sufficient to
ensure that the road functions at the originally intended service level. In
this case more extensive works are required, such as repair or renewal of base
course and reconstruction of drainage structures. Periodic and deferred
maintenance will be carried out in part by two regravelling brigades each
assigned to a specific region every year (for 1983/84 Casamance and Senegal
Oriental) and mostly by DERM contracting with private firms. The yearly
program of periodic and deferred maintenance will increase between the first
and fourth year of the program from 170 km to 300 km of gravel road, and cover
about 80 km of bitumen roads. Altogether, during the Project period, periodic
and deferred maintenance will have reached about 1,300 km of roads. The
design basis and standard specifications for road rehabilitation and deferred
maintenance are available from on-going works and are satisfactory. They are
based on observed axle loadings.
2.09     Regular renewal of the DERM road maintenance equipment fleet should
resume at the start of the Project. No regular renewal has taken place over
the last two years, but equipment utilization has also been so low that
systematic renewal has not been warranted. With operational funds readily
available under the Project, a regular yearly renewal worth an average of
about CFAF 600 million will be required; to account for the existing backlog
of renewals, equipment acquisition would be concentrated in FY85 and FY86.

2.10     The financial and cost accounting systems which are by now in place
together with the yearly work planning system (Annexes 2-2 and 3) are ade-
quate, but surveillance of the way in which they are operated will be required
for the first part of the Project period. In February 1983 an expert in
financial management started further training of Senegalese for the auditing
tasks; his services, financed under the Fourth Highway Project for a period of
15 months, may be extended as needed.
2.11     Much of the effectiveness of the Road Fund can be attributed to the
regional revolving fund arrangement, by virtue of which each maintenance
region and the central DERM are provided with advances from the Road Fund to
pay for immediate expenditures, such as spares and supplies. In the FY83 Road
Fund budget these advances amounted to CFAF 625 million or about 1/3 of the
Fund budget of CFAF 1.8 billion. However, the regions are still too dependent
on the central DERM purchasing of bulk items, and a full autonomy for them to
purchase these items should be encouraged now thait satisfactory audits are
possible. Altogether, a proper decentralization of road maintenance purchases
would require a cash flow through the central and regional revolving funds of
about CFAF 1.2 billion yearly. During negotiations, agreement was reached
with the Government that it will (i) increase the limit of yearly funding
through the revolving funds to some CFAF 1.2 billion in constant 1983 prices,
and (ii) in consultation with IDA establish the ye!arly amounts to be channeled
through each revolving fund. Increase of the revc,lving fund ceiling is a
condition of effectiveness, and has been enacted.
2.12     Regular replenishment of the Road Fund and through it of the regional
revolving funds is a prerequisite for proper performance of the Project. The
necesary advance payments into the revolving funds would total about CFAF 600
million at the start of each fiscal year.  The revolving funds will be
replenished from the Road Fund on the basis of purchase documentation for
previous expenditures, reviewed by DERM and the Ministry of Finance, as
proposed in Annex 2-4. However, as the Road Fund is only a line item in the
budget, IDA's contributions will be deposited in a special, separate project
account to avoid their being confused with the general treasury funds.
C. Cost Estimates
2.13     Cost estimates for the Project are derived from (i) the work program,
(ii) the DERM cost accounting system for road maintenance operations, and
(iii) recent bids and price quotations for the supply of equipment, spares and
materials in Senegal. The project cost is summarized in the following table
and detailed in Annex 2-5.

2.14      The project estimate covers the operations program of the Ministry of
Equipment concerning road maintenance during four years, 1983/4-1986/7,
excluding the general budget standard provision for salaries and administra-
tion. It also specifically excludes new construction by the Feeder Roads
Bureau (BPP); in principle short access roads can be financed under the Road
Fund for up to 10% of its total budget, but given the various financial
sources available for feeder road construction, the Road Fund is now planned
entirely for maintenance. The maintenance of the roads constructed by the BPP
is included in the work plan of the DERM, and is thus part of the Project.
2.15      Total road maintenance program cost (including US$6.9 million equiva-
lent from the general budget for permanent staff salaries and administration)
are estimated at CFAF 21.2 billion or US$56.8 million equivalent including
taxes and duties. This also covers US$9.5 million equivalent in price con-
tingencies at an annual inflation rate for local costs of 10% throughout the
Project period, and for foreign costs of 8% in 1983, 7.5% in 1984, 7% in 1985
and 6% thereafter. Project costs, which exclude the costs of permanent staff
salaries and administration, thus amount to US$49.9 million equivalent, of
which US$23.7 million equivalent or 48% would be in foreign exchange, US$16.6
million equivalent or 33% local costs net of taxes, and US$9.6 million equiva-



- 8 -
lent or 19% would be taxes and duties. Of the total project cost, about 60%
can be considered recurrent and 40% capital expenditures. Following the
Project period, an annual road maintenance budget of CFAF 3 billion adjusted
for inflation should again be sufficient.
D. Financing
2.16     Under the Project, IDA would finance a declining share of the Road
Fund, from 65% in FYs 84 and 85 down to 30% in FY86 and 25% in FY87. IDA
would participate retroactively in the financing of the FY84 program after
September 1, 1983, the date when expenditures for the FY84 work season were
first incurred. The proposed Credit of US$21.5 million equivalent (SDR 20.4
million) would finance 43% of total project costs as incurred over the Road
Fund, excluding any feeder roads construction. This represents 53% of project
costs net of taxes and duties. For the current fiscal year (FY84), and in
order to support Senegal's difficult budgetary situation, IDA funds would
finance, on a retroactive basis, 65% of expenditures eligible under the
project and made after September 1, 1983. Such retroactive financing by IDA
is estimated not to exceed US$1.5 million equivalent. For the subsequent
years of the program, FY85 through FY87, an advance would be made by IDA to
the Road Project Account in order to offset the fact that Senegal's budgetary
procedures do not allow the Road Fund or the regional funds to be replenished
until well into the new fiscal year. Thus, an advance of CFAF 630 million in
FY85, and one of CFAF 340 million in FY86 and FY87 would be made by IDA at the
start of these fiscal years to the Road Project Account and then channelled to
the regional revolving funds. As soon as budgetary procedures allow disburse-
ment of domestic resources, the Government would deposit into the revolving
funds an amount which would bring the total financing of the funds to be
shared in the intended proportion between IDA and the Borrower. Subsequently,
the revolving funds would be replenished by IDA (through the Road Project
Account) and by the Government (through the Road Fund) in the agreed propor-
tions on the basis of documentation reviewed by DERM and the Ministry of
Finance. During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government that
it will not finance any new construction works of the BPP with IDA funds.
2.17     The financing system requires the Ministry of Finance to undertake:
(a)  to participate in the yearly budget exercise establishing the road
maintenance budget, and to introduce budget proposals in constant
1983 terms of CFAF 1.7 billion in and 1984/85, and CFAF 3.2 billion
in 1985/86 and CFAF 3.0 billion 1986/87 in time for their approval
before the commencement of each fiscal year;
(b) to ensure that amounts required for the operation of the regional
revolving funds are released regularly as and when required.
Agreements on these points were reached at negotiations. USAID is contemplat-
ing to grant US$10.0 million (CFAF 3.7 billion) from its Economic Support Fund
to participate in financing the Road Fund in 1985/86 and 1986/87. This would
result in the Government's contribution to the Project being limited to
expenditures for taxes and salaries.



- 9-
E. Procurement under the Project
2.18     Procurement under the Project will follow the Ministry of Equipment
procedures, which are in accordance with Bank/IDA Guidelines (see para 3.12).
Purchases of new equipment and related spare parts for road maintenance and
workshops, and bulk purchases of imported materials will be on the basis of
i.c.b.  Materials and spares that cannot be conveniently grouped into lots
worth more than US$ 60,000 and fuel which is available only from Senegal's
single refinery, will be procured on the basis of l.c.b procedures acceptable
to the Association up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$ 0.5 million per
year. Minor items of urgently needed spare parts and materials, not exceeding
US$5,000 per purchase and US$22,000 per region per year in aggregate, may be
procured by local shopping or direct purchase. Contracts for civil works
(periodic and deferred maintenance) will be awarded following l.c.b. These
arrangements are in accordance with the Senegalese regulations for procurement
and within the ceilings that can be approved at the various levels (para. 3.12).
During negotiations, the procurement arrangements were reviewed and agreed
upon with the Government.
2.19     The relative importance of the various procurement methods are esti-
mated to be as follows: i.c.b. US$35.8 million or 72% of project cost; l.c.b.
US$11.0 million or 22%; direct purchase US$1 million or 2%. The remaining 4%
of expenditures are not subject to procurement (mainly salaries for temporary
staff). Procurement will cover some US$7.3 million equivalent worth of
equipment, US$10.8 million equivalent for spares and tires, US$9.6 million
equivalent for fuel and lubricants, and US$14.1 million equivalent for civil
works by contract. Contracts for supply and works estimated to exceed
US$60,000 should be reviewed with the Association.
F. Disbursements
2.20     The disbursement process for revolving funds is shown on Annex 2-4.
As the Road Fund is in fact only a budget line, IDA's disbursements will be
made into a special Treasury Project account so as to avoid that the proceeds
go into the general Treasury pool. Required documentation for expenditures
would be twofold: certified invoices or contrac-tor's statements, and certifi-
cates of work actually performed. The annual work program contains estimates
of required cash flow and work output over the year, and documentation
required for disbursement would be a form that permits comparison between
actual and forecast expenditures and work output. The Ministries of Equipment
and of Finance will review the statements before replenishing the revolving
funds and/or disbursing from the Road Fund and the project account. The Road
Fund and the account will be audited every year by auditors acceptable to the
Association. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
on the form of required documentation and procedures. Based on the disburse-
ment rates shown in para. 2.16, and the expected effectiveness date in FY84,
IDA's Credit would be disbursed as follows (Annex 2-6):

FY87            3.5               21.5
However, if further external financing (para 2.17) is not secured, the
disbursement rates may be changed so that the Credit is disbursed more evenly
over time. Since the Project is a time-slice of a continuous operation, a
comparison with disbursement profiles from other projects is not relevant.
G. Reporting and Reviews
2.21     DERM prepares quarterly and annual reports, and the Bank normally
receives a copy; this practice will be continued under the Project. A major
review of the progress in implementing policies for road maintenance and
staffing of the Ministry should be held at about mid-point in project imple-
mentation; at that time the financial situation and prospects for road maint-
enance will also be reviewed. The Government has agreed to discuss its yearly
investment programs with the Association.
III. EXECUTING AGENCY
3.01     The Directorate of Road Maintenance and Equipment of the General
Directorate of Public Works in the Ministry of Equipment will be the executing
agency of the Project (Annex 3-1). This Directorate is one of the best of its
kind in West Africa, as is evidenced by its recent performance: although in
the years between FY77 and FY80 funds allocated to road maintenance did not
increase in real terms, the quantity and quality of maintenance works improved
significantly (Annex 1-2). In the following years, funding for road mainte-
nance declined, and the Directorate decided to concentrate maintenance efforts
on the paved network, a sound decision in view of the cost of rehabilitation
should the pavements be destroyed. The condition of the paved network there-
fore remained stable, whereas the gravel and earth network became increasingly
neglected despite that improving work methods and planning did cushion the
work volume somewhat from the adverse effects of reduced funding (Annex 1-1,
page 2).
A. Organisation
3.02     Serious efforts to improve the road maintenance began in the early
1970s with a study carried out under the First Highway Project. It recom-
mended a centralization of maintenance activities; these were carried out by
the Regional Public Works offices, with somewhat diffuse lines of responsi-
bility. The proposed centralization was started in the first years of the
Second Highway Project and was not a success. The central units that were
established for operations and equipment, respectively, never asserted them-



- 11 -
selves sufficiently to gain effective control of the tasks assigned to them.
The new organization ran counter to established practices, did not receive
high-level support, was not provided with staff of adequate quantity and
quality, and turned out to be far tco complex for practical operations. After
some three years of generally unsuccessful endeavours, the centralization
experiment was abandoned, and since then, increasing emphasis has been placed
on improving decentralized maintenance operations restricting the central
organization to controlling, planning, budgeting and auditing functions. The
first tangible efforts in this direction began in 1977, under the Third High-
way Project. Road maintenance is now the responsibility of the Maintenance
Division (DER) in the DERM in the General Directorate of Public Works (DGTP)
of the Ministry of Equipment. Equipment maintenance is being done by the
Equipment Divison (DM), also in the DERM.  The actual execution of maintenance
works by force account is carried out by the eight Regional Offices of the
DGTP. Subcontracted works, mainly for periodic maintenance of gravel roads,
are administered by DERM.
B. Staff
3.03     The total staff directly engaged in road maintenance numbers about
900. The staff is, compared to other countries in West Africa, at nearly all
levels quite well-qualified, and the critical lack of capable manpower so
often seen in neighboring countries is not present. There are about 20 engi-
neers, 50 technicians, 60 brigade chiefs, 300 drivers, operators and mecha-
nics, and,500 laborers. However, the age distribution of the personnel is
such that about 1/3 of the permanent staff has retired in the last 2 years,
and some 400 more are close to retirement age. This is due to a long freeze
on staff hiring that still prevails. There has also been a complete lack of
training of field staff since the early 1970s, when the then existing training
programs were abandoned. Although the reduction in staff through retirement
was desirable it has resulted in an unbalanced work force as the DERM hired
"temporary" personnel who in fact may have been employed for up to 10 years,
but who have not had formal training. This in turn has resulted in undesir-
able disparities within the DERM work force as concerils employment security
and benefits. Many other Government agencies find themselves in the same
situation and the Government is seeking a solution that could be applied to
the entire civil service. It is unlikely that such a solution will be found
before the start of the proposed project, but the DGTP has already appointed
temporaries to the vacancies left by attrition in 1982 and at negotiations
agreement was reached with the Government that it, would endeavor as an interim
measure to bring employment conditions for "'temporary" staff in line with
those for permanent staff, until new regulations concerning all public
employees enter into force. The staffing situation will be part of the
criteria for assessing the project's performance at mid-term (para. 2.21).
3.04     Training of the staff has restarted in 1982, under the Fourth Highway
Project's training program which would continue through 1985 with an expatri-
ate team of trainers and Senegalese counterpart instructors; there is present-
ly a shortage of counterparts, but the DGTP is taking measures to fill the
posts in question.



- 12 -
C. Equipment
3e05     The equipment fleet of the DERM is not quite adequate for the task on
hand. There are some 250 pieces of equipment available for road maintenance,
and in working condition or requiring minor repairs. About 20 additional
units would be required to bring all maintenance brigades up to full strength,
and, in addition9 yearly renewals of the equipment fleet should be assured to
replace fully depreciated units.
3.06     The Equipment Division plans equipment needs and deployment based on
the road maintenance program, specific tasks and type of equipment
(Annex 3-2). In conjunction with the periodic equipment inventory, the
workshop, repairs and priorities and required budget are determined.
Important repairs are done at the Central Workshop, or, when necessary in
private workshops, while minor repairs and preventive maintenance are
performed in the regional workshops following routine inspections. The system
foresees that productivity/outputs be monitored, to further improve planning
and costing.  The system seems adequate, although it is not always followed as
rigorously as desired. Equipment management is probably the weakest link in
the process; this is being addressed under the onigoing Fourth Highway Project.
3.07     Equipment maintenance is in present circumstances reasonably
adequate, with a downtime of 15% attributed to mechanical failures. However,
the frequent work stoppages in recent years due to lack of operating funds or
delays in delivery of supplies could mask a maintenance efficiency lower than
that indicated. This may come to light once the funding and supply situations
are remedied.
D. Planning and Cost-Accounting
3.08     Work planning for maintenance has made major progress in recent
years. At present a system has been established for (i) collection of data on
road conditions, (ii) cost accounting for ongoing operations, and (iii)
iterative establishment of work volumes in the light of prevailing budget
revisions and constraints. In extension of this, a system for auditing the
use of financial and physical resources has been instituted and has given
good, although not entirely complete, results for the first periods in which
it was employed.
3.09     An outline of the planning and auditing system is given in Annex
3-3.  Work plans are established an the assumption that routine maintenance
will be done by force account and periodic maintenance mainly by contract.
The inventory of road conditions is compared to the physical capacity of the
force account brigades and the unit prices of contract works. A final work
plan can then be established in iteration with the budget proposal. This
planning system had worked increasingly well over the last three years, gain-
ing wide acceptance both in the Ministry of Equipment and the agencies
concerned with budget preparation and approval. The planning system is now
nearly 3ompletely run by Senegalese, and final phasing out of expatriate
consultants is planned for late 1985. It was agreed at negotiations that the
Bank will have an apportunity to review the final yearly plans and the related
budgets.



- 13 -
3.10     The cost-accounting system established in the DERM, is carried out by
some 50 "temporary" accountant staff specially trained for the purpose. While
the system is a big improvement over the previous lack of accountability and
has permitted to pinpoint irregularities, it is still not properly applied at
the Equipment Division; better Public Works qualified staff (accountants,
controllers, inspectors) is needed as well as a better coordination with the
Ministry of Finance's purely financial audit. The first audits of the use of
funds released for road maintenance revealed quite serious anomalies in the
use of certain goods and supplies, in particular fuel. This led to the
replacement of two senior staff in the DERM and a further tightening of
accounting practices.
3.11     Consultants have proposed an intensified follow up:  each Region
should have an accountant (IUT or BTS) with 2 assistant accountants (CAP), one
for purely financial records and the other for cost accounting. At Dakar, a
chief accountant (DECS) should be assisted by 3 accountants (IUT or BTS), to
a) verify regional accounts, b) collate regional accounts, and c) facilitate
replenishment at the Treasury. Further, there should be an independent RF
senior accountant responsible for financial control within the Ministry of
Finance. An expatriate expert in financial management has been recruited for
a stay of 15 months to oversee this.
E. Procurement
3.12     The Regional Public Works can contract independently up to  CFAF 8
million per contract and with the approval of the Regional Contract Committees
up to CFAF 20 million per contract. In excess of these limits, and up to CFAF
50 million, contracts are prepared at Dakar, by the DERM, DGTP and/or the
Minister of Equipment, and can be approved by the Director General of
Finances; contracts between CFAF 50-100 million are undertaken by the Minister
of Economy and Finances, and those exceeding CFAF 100 million by the
Presidency. Awards are also reviewed by the Commission Nationale des Contrats
de l'Administration. Thus, most procurement is done by the DERM, with
delivery to the Regions. Delays of 280 days from preparing call for bids to
contract notification are common. Delays are compounded when procedures are
not well followed and documents are returned for correction. However, it is
not clear why new bids are required in the case of repetitive purchases for
operations, more so when official uniform prices apply, such as for fuels, and
only eventually a minor discount may be obtained. The use of the revolving
funds follows general Ministry of Finance 1976 instructions: they are to be
used exclusively for temporary staff salaries, travel costs, fuels, materials,
spares, tires, maintenance and work site expenses. The amounts given to each
region depend on their respective programs and related foreseen quarterly
expenses by item and work category, presented to the DERM (Annex 2-2);
monthly accounts have to be presented to obtain replenishment. The revolving
fund system proved to greatly facilitate timely procurement for regional
needs, and, in some cases, better prices were obtained through regional rather
than centralized procurement.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
4.01     It is well known that road maintenance is one of the activities with
highest returns, both due to the postponement of the need for infrastructure
renewal and to the lowering of vehicle operating costs. Despite the need for
imported equipment, it also has on overall posit:ive effect on the balance of
payments. The main concerns for road maintenance are therefore operating
efficiency, including determination of proper levels of maintenance, and
adequacy of funding, including timeliness.
4.02     While Senegal had been making progress, slowly and not without diffi-
culties, on the operating efficiency to the extent of being now one of the
most able in the road maintenance field in West Africa, the funding avail-
ability worsened due to the overall Government financial crisis of recent
years. While a budget of some CFAF 3 billion is required yearly, only about a
third was actually spent recently. With such reduced levels, salaries
absorbed a disproportionate amount, and what was left, was properly used for
the highest return activities, especially routine maintenance of paved
roads. While such choice is effective over 2-3 years, it cannot be sustained
as it cannot replace the periodic heavier maintenance tasks, and would allow
even the paved roads to deteriorate. Senegal is in the third year of insuf-
ficient road maintenance budgets, and it is now imperative to provide proper
funding to preserve its infrastructure.
4-03     In this context a "catching up" program was prepared, requiring an
average of some CFAF 4 billion per year over the next four years. While
rehabilitation/ strengthening of paved roads contiLnues under the Fourth
Highway Project, the maintenance program foresees: to expand the network
under routine maintenance from 7,600 km in 1981/2 to 10,500 km by 1986/7; to
regravel annually almost 1,000 km, that is, a doubling of the "normal" kilo-
metrage; and to resurface some 80 km per year. Both the regravelling and the
resurfacing are and will continue to be carried out by domestic contractors,
at competitive prices, and this will avoid building up the administration to
higher than normally required capacity. Although the idea of employing labor-
intensive techniques in a depressed economy looks appealing, it is not borne
out by other realities in Senegal:  the DERM is not overstaffed; people are
not "idle", are not readily available along the roads outside the groundnut
basin, and mainly, enjoy a high minimum salary by law, of some US$6/day.
Further, the need to catch up requires speed, which could not be obtained with
labor intensive techniques, and Senegalese equipment operators are more and
better than in other West-African countries.
4.04     A glance at the determinants of the estimated rate of return will
help explain why it is so high: traffic, road conditions, road maintenance
costs and vehicle operating costs.
A. Traffic
4.05     The Ministry of Equipment carries out traffic counts routinely;  the
latest results available cover 1981. On the paved roads traffic ranges from
18,000 vpd (Dakar-Rufisque) to some 100 vpd (Annex 4-1); the average



- 15 -
(excluding Dakar-Rufisque) on "national" roads was some 630 vpd, of which 78%
light vehicles; the average on surveyed "regional" roads was some 465 vpd (the
average for all paved regional roads may be some 300 vpd) with 84% light
vehicles. On the unpaved roads, traffic was an average 110 vpd on surveyed
regional sections, accounting for some 730 km and 65 vpd average on some 600
km of national roads. The unsurveyed sections carry normally less traffic,
and feeder roads, no more than some 20 vpd. On the unpaved roads light
vehicles account for some 75% of the traffic. While traffic was increasing
faster than 10% p.a. during 1975-79, it had mostly stagnated or slightly
decreased by 1981 counts, reflecting the overall economic downward trend
caused by draughts and low export prices. It has been assumed that traffic
levels would be similar to that of 1981 in 1983 (Annex 4-1), recover
thereafter and continue to grow at 5% p.a.
B. Road Conditions
4.06     Using a five-tiered rating, of 5 for exceLlent to 1, very poor, the
1982 conditions averaged 3.4 for paved roads and only 1.9 for unpaved roads,
for a "maintained" network of some 8,500 km. Should the current shortage of
funds continue, the unpaved roads would soon become very poor, some unpassable
and the paved roads would also require considerable rehabilitation. With the
maintenance program (Annex 2-1), the network maintained would increase to
10,500 km, and the average condition expected would be 3.7 for paved and 2.6
for unpaved roads, which are considered good averages (Annex 4-2).
C. Road Maintenance Costs
4.07     The strategy behind the program gives first priority to preserving
the paved roads; those having deteriorated to rating 2 would be resurfaced,
those worse should await rehabilitation but would as the better ones be
routinely patched. Unpaved roads would be regravelled upon reaching index 2,
others would be spot regravelled and gravelled and graded as needed. The
surface improvements would be supported by routine maintenance of drainage
systems, bridges, shoulders, signalisation, etc. Unit costs are at the
following levels: CFAF 9.2 m (US$24,700) per km of resurfacing; CFAF 3.5 m
(US$9,400) per km of regravelling; CFAF 88,000 (US$235) per km of patching;
CFAF 150,000 (US$400) per km of spot regravelling; CFAF 21,500 (US$60) per km
of grading (but some roads require several passes of grader per year). Other
routine maintenance costs average about CFAF 76,200 (US$200) per km. The
common view in Africa that it is cheaper maintaining paved roads than unpaved
roads stems from comparing only patching versus spot regravelling and grading
costs, while the resurfacing and full regravelling costs ought to be con-
sidered as well. Costs of works by task are shown in Annex 4-3.
D. Vehicle Operating Costs
4.08     A reduction in vehicle operating costs is the direct benefit of road
maintenance. An estimate has been made of the operating costs on good and
poor surfaces; interpolations were used for the intermediate conditions.
Given the various assumptions above, it is estimated that the public would
save in operating costs the equivalent of the Road Fund of CFAF 4 billion over
each of the 4 years, stemming from an assumed saving of less than US$0.01 per
vehicle-km (Annex 4-4).

E. Rates of Returns and Benefit-Cost Ratios
4.09     Based on the preceding discussion of benefits and costs to be derived
from a four-year maintenance program defined yearly with the agreed criteria
for work scope and selection, the overall economic rate of return is higher
than 100%. Separate rates of return have also been calculated for the perio-
dic maintenance components, yielding 25% for full regravelling and 86% for
resurfacing. The benefit-cost ratios, which are more meaningful for main-
tenance projects than the rates of return, are also fully satisfactory: the
overall B:C is 2.1; for paved roads it is 3.5:1 eLnd for gravel roads it is
1.6:1, at a 12% discount rate. Naturally, maintenance on higher traffic roads
yield the highest returns. Even if traffic growth would not resume as
expected (para. 4.05) or the works were to be carried out less efficiently,
the maintenance program remains well justified with B:C ratio above 1 (Annex
4-4).
F. Project Risks
4.10     The main risk to achieving expected benefit from the Project concerns
(1) operating efficiency of the project agency, and (2) adequacy and
timeliness of funding. In the first instance, DERM has demonstrated its
operational efficiency, so that this risk is considered marginal. There is,
however, the possibility that Government's budgetary situation may not improve
sufficiently over the coming years to allow it to assume an increasing share,
and eventually the full burden of financing the Rzad Fund. In such event,
alternative solutions would be considered by Government and IDA during the
proposed mid-term review.
V.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECCIMMENDATION
5.01     During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:
(i)   a payment schedule for the counterpart funds that Government owes
under the Fourth Highway Project (para. 1.06); full payments have
since been made;
(ii)   raising the global ceiling of the revolving funds to CFAF 1.2 billion
in constant 1983 prices (para. 2.11); a decree to this effect has
since been issued;
(iii)   that, yearly with IDA, DERM shall discuss the proposed annual work
program, budget and each revolving fund amount and the Government
shall discuss its road investment program (paras. 2.11, 2.21 and
3-09);
(iv)   the Government will endeavour to bring employment conditions for
temporary staff in line with those in permanent positions; the Road
Fund and the ceiling on revolving funds may be lowered accordingly as
the salary burden on the Road Fund decreases (para 3.03);



- 17 -
(v)   procurement and disbursement procedures, i.e., requisite documenta-
tion and that, except for an initial yearly advance, the IDA Credit
will reimburse the Road Fund through a Project account (paras. 2.12,
2.16, 2.18 and 2.20);
(vi)   that no new feeder road construction will be financed with the Road
Fund (para. 2.16); and
(vii)   that a mid-term review will be held between the Government and IDA to
review the implementation of maintenance and staffing policies, and
of financial resources available (para. 2.21).
5.02     During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will
provide to the Road Fund, in constant 1983 terms, CFAF 1.7 billion in 1984/85,
and CFAF 3.2 billion in 1985/86 and 3.0 billion in 1986/87 (para 2.17).
5.03     Payment to contractors of counterpart fund arrears owed under the
Fourth Highway Project (para. 1.06), was a condition of Board Presentation.
5.04     A condition of effectiveness was the issuance of the decree raising
the ceiling of the revolving funds to CFAF 1.2 billion (para. 2.11).
5.05     Retroactive financing under the Project of the Borrower's road
maintenance program for expenditures incurred after September 1, 1983 is
recommended (para. 2.16).
5.06     As agreements on the above items have been obtained, and conditions
of Board Presentation and effectiveness have all been met, the Project is
suitable for a SDR 20.4 million (US$21.5 million) IDA Credit on standard
terms.

FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Past/Ongoing Bank Group Transport Operations
1.       The first Bank transport project for Senegal was approved in 1966 to
assist in rehabilitating the railway's infrastructure and equipment
(Cr. 96-SE, $9 million, 1966), and was complemented by the First Dakar Port
Project (Ln. 493-SE, $4 million, 1967) to improve infrastructure and
operations; the First Highway Project followed three years later
(Cr. 198-SE, $2.1 million, 1970) for the construction of feeder roads,
purchase of maintenance equipment, technical assistance and studies; the First
Aviation Project (Ln. 867-SE, US$3 million, 1972) comprised the extension of
the runway at Dakar, enlarging aircraft parking aprons and related works.
Despite being relatively simple projects, they each took some seven years to
complete. A Second Railway Project (Cr. 314-SE, Ln. 835-SE,
$9.6 million, 1972) was approved and before the First Highway Project was
completed, a second followed based on the First's studies, providing for
strengthening of paved roads, further assistance to road maintenance and
studies (Cr. 366-SE, $8 million, 1973). The Third Highway Project completed
the operations of the Second (which experienced high cost overruns) and also
included assistance for transport planning and a study of the domestic
contracting industry (Ln. 1222-SE, US$15 million, 1976). A Feeder Road
Project was processed in parallel (Ln. 1221-SE, US$6.6 million, 1976).
2.       Project Completion Reports were prepared for the 2nd and Feeder Road
Projects. The conclusions were that the 2nd project implemented successfully
the road strengthening program, but the road maintenance program was less
successful and was perhaps an inevitable first step. Lessons learned helped
improving road maintenance under the Third Highway Project, with the good
results known today. Results from the Feeder Road Project were also mixed;
less than foreseen km were built, but the economic return of 14% was still
acceptable. The institutional set up gradually improved but upon completion
of the project the equipment and staff were integrated into the DERM.

3.        Subsequent projects are still being implemented:
The Dakar Fishing Port Project (Ln. 1405-T-SE, US$6 million, 1977)
cofinanced by BADEA and CCCE provided for reclamation of 10.5 ha
of land, construction of 1,500 m new berth face and ancillary
works, technical assistance for management, cost accounting and
introduction of a new tariff (ad valorem) structure, and a study
for a container terminal; it is almost complete, within the cost
estimate, and a balance is being used for a full audit of the Port
accounts and establishing an improvecL accounting system.
-  Implementation of the two railway projects was disappointing with
little impact on improving operations; the Third Railway Project
(Ln 1518-SE, US$11 million, 1979) was processed with the
expectation that the railway operaticns could be improved through
track renewal, marshalling yard and telecommunications
improvements in Dakar, and provision of spares, maintenance
equipment, training and technical assistance. The Project is vir-
tually complete, at a 20% cost overrun, and the closing date was
postponed from December 1981 to December 1983. In an effort to
improve the financial situation of the railway, the Government has
negotiated a contract plan with the railway, including an
agreement on the investment plan for the next years; the Bank has
approved the first phase in the context of the Project and the
SAL.
The Second Aviation Project (In. 1665--SE, US$7 milliion, 1979)
provided for improvement of the Dakar runways; fAavigation aids and
runway lighting at Ziguinchor and visual approach aids at Cap
Skirring. It is practically completed at 50% of the cost
estimate, and use of balance funds has been approved for
improvement of the terminal building and new runway lighting at
Dakar, and for an audit of the implementing agency.
The Fourth Highway Project (Ln. 1810/Cr. 993-SEN, US$38 million,
1980), approved after the Government had taken action on the Road
Fund and agreed to a yearly funding of CFAF 3 billion at 1980
prices, provides for a 3-year training program and technical
assistance for road maintenance, assistance to the National Soils
Laboratory, strenghthening of an additional 200 km of paved roads
and construction to paved road standards of the 85 km Louga-Dahra
Road. The Project is advancing well; as the dollar appreciated

ANNEX 1-5
Page 3
vis-a-vis the FCFA, the lending amount enables expansion of strengthening
works.
4.       The most recent Project, for the SEFICS rail (Ln. 2025-SE, US$19.3
million, 1981) will upgrade the siding track from the fertilizer factory at
M'Bao to the Dakar-Thies, CFS line, and would procure locomotives, wagons, and
maintenance facilities. It is expected that such independent operation will
be more efficient and economic than the one so far provided by CFS.
5.       Thus, over the past 15 years the Bank Group has invested US$138.6
million in the sector under 13 loans/credits (four for railways, US$48.9
million; two port, US$10 million; two aviation, US$10 million; four roads,
US$69.7 million), also financed feeder roads under agricultural projects and
mobilized considerable cofinancing. The Bank's share of Senegal's transport
investments would have been the following, based on an average exchange rate
of US$1 = CFAF 230 for 1973/77 and 210 for 1977/81, and separating amounts
still to be disbursed under ongoing projects:
