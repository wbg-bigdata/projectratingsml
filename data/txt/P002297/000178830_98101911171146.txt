SUMMARY
i.        The Societe Financiere Senegalaise pour le Developpement de
l'Industrie et du Tourisme (SOFISEDIT) was created in 1974 by the Govern-
ment of Senegal to provide term financing for industry and tourism develop-
ment. The World Bank Group participated actively for more than a year in
the preparatory work for the creation of the institution and was also in-
strumental in launching the company. SOFISEDIT's share capital is divided
among the Government of Senegal and Senegalese public sector institutions,
the Central Bank, commercial banks and foreign institutions including IFC.
ii.       In the early 1960's, Senega]L's industrial enterprises faced
problems of excess capacity due to the loss of the West African market
for manufactured products as local industries developed in the newly in-
dependent nations. Despite this handicap, the industrial sector (defined
to include manufacturing as well as mining, energy and production of con-
struction materials) has grown consistently since independence; the sector's
contribution to GDP at factor cost increased from 13% in 1960 to 17% in 1970
and 20% in 1974. During that period, industry developed in real terms at an
annual rate of 5.2%, while the overall rate of growth of the economy was only
9.2%. Between 1975 and 1980, the industrial sector is expected to continue
its development in real terms at an annual rate of about 7%.
iii.      Dlanufacturing accounts for about 12% of GDP in 1974 and for almost
60% of value added in the industrial sector. During the 1960-1974 period
total value added in manufacturing increased at an annual rate of 4.7%.
Activities that developed the most during that period were groundnut refining,
food industry, textiles, paper and printing, chemical industries. During
the coming years, manufacturing is expected to grow at an annual rate of 7%.
The majority of modern enterprises in Senegal are foreign-owned. In order to
encourage the development of Senegalese entrepreneurship, the Government
created in 1969, the Societe Nationale d'Etudes et de Promotion Industrielle
(SONEPI). Moreover, it is implementing a "Senegalization" plan to increase
local participation in the management of enterprise. Major obstacles to the
development of Senegal's manufacturing activities include the narrowness of
the domestic market, the cost of power and water and the shortage of technical
and managerial skills. The essential features of the Government industrial
policies are the development of export-oriented industries, the implementation
of large industrial projects and the promotion of Senegalese enterprises.
iv.       Tourism is considered one of the priority sectors in Senegal.  In
recent years, facilities and the level of activities in the sector have in-
creased considerably. The number of rooms available for international
tourism has increased from 300 in 1970 to over 2,000 in 1974, while tourist
arrivals during this period rose from 36,000 to about 125,000. The Govern-
ment's objective is to attract about 200,000 tourists a year by the end of
the Fourth Development Plan in 1977.

v.        SOFISEDIT has made a successful start to its operations and
now employs twenty-one staff members. It is managed by a team of three
persons, the President-Director General, his Deputy and the Director of
Investments. The latter two who have been seconded by the World Bank to
assist in starting the company, are training the staff which is of a good
quality. Project appraisals are of a high quality and operating procedures
are adequate.
vi.       From beginning of operations in March 1974 to June 30, 1976,
SOFISEDIT has approved nineteen loans totaling CFAF 1,361 million and five
equity investments totaling CFAF 86.5 million. Over that period, SOFISEDIT
had a loss of CFAF 17.5 million mainly due to high start-up expenses and low
revenue; however as of June 30, 1976 SOFISEDIT was sound and creditworthy.
Although the amount of financing provided so far is still modest in comparison
with total investment in industry and tourism in Senegal, SOFISEDIT is already
emerging as a significant source of term finance for the industrial and tourism
sectors.
vii.      Recent changes in policy by the Central Bank in removing automatic
rediscount ceilings for individual banks and in setting sectoral priorities
for the rediscounting of loans of up to ten years should enhance the demand
for term finance from SOFISEDIT. Through its appraisal capabilities,
SOFISEDIT should be able to clearly demonstrate the financial and economic
merits of projects to the Central Bank and thereby enhance the probability
of a project being rediscounted. Commercial banks however, without such
appraisal capabilities, may be more hesitant in proposing projects for re-
discounting where failure to secure a rediscount would result in their having
to use their own short-term deposits to finance loans of up to ten years.
For longer-term lending SOFISEDIT's interest rate and term compare favourably
with competing institutions offering floating Eurodollar based rates. Thus
SOFISEDIT's operations are expected to develop substantially.
viii.     SOFISEDIT had, as of June 1976, a pipeline of twenty projects under
study amounting to a total investment of CFAF 6.1 billion. The potential
SOFISEDIT investment in these projects amounts to CFAF 1.5 billion in medium-
and long-term loans and CFAF 96 million in equity investments. In addition,
it has a pipeline of CFAF 14.4 billion for 1977-1980. Forecast of SOFISEDIT's
financing of these projects amount to CFAF 3.0 billion in loans and CFAF
200 million in equity investments. The company is expected to break-even
in 1977 and thereafter has an attractive earnings potential.
ix.       SOFISEDIT's long-term lending based on commitments from inception
to December 31, 1978 is expected to amount to CFAF 2 billion (US$8.9 million).
Its existing resources will last until approximately December 1976 and there-
after there will be a resource gap of US$5.9 million to December 31, 1978.
A recommended Bank loan of US$4.2 million would meet approximately two-thirds
of SOFISEDIT's long-term foreign exchange resource gap to December 31, 1978,
and provide US$200,000 for technical assistance to SONEPI to carry out a study
of the informal sector with the view of implementing a pilot small enterprise

development project. The free limit for individual subprojects should be
raised from $100,000 to $250,000 in recognition of the progress made in
SOFISEDIT's appraisal capabilities. The aggregate free limit would be in-
creased from $600,000 to $1.5 million.
x.        Subject to the conditions listed in Chapter VI, the project is
suitable for a loan of US$ 4.2 million equivalent.



APPRAISAL OF THE
SOCIETE FINANCIERE SENEGALAISE
POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT DE L'INDUSTRIE ET DU TOURISME (SOFISEDIT)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      SOFISEDIT was created by the Government of Senegal in 1974 for
the purpose of providing term financing for industry and tourism develop-
ment. The World Bank Group participated actively for more than a year in
the preparatory work for the creation of the institution and was also
instrumental in launching the company. It helped place about 25% of the
company's capital: 8% were subscribed by IFC and 17% by foreign institu-
tions at the invitation of the Bank Group. It also supplemented SOFISEDIT's
initial resources by granting in May 1974 a loan (987-SE) of US$3 million;
it seconded a Bank staff member to become the Deputy Director General of
the company, and assisted in the recruitment of a Director of Investments.
1.02      It is expected that SOFISEDIT's first Bank loan will be fully
committed by the end of 1976. This report reviews the company's perform-
ance and outlook, and recommends a second Bank loan of $4.2 million, with the
following objectives:
(i) to provide term financing on appropriate terms to enterprises
in industry and tourism for projects in Senegal, which have
been well conceived on economic, financial and technical
grounds;
(ii) to continue to support the growth of SOFISEDIT as a leading
development institution in Senegal through strengthening its
resource base, its project appraisal capabilities, internal
organization and procedures.
(iii) to provide technical assistance to SONEPI to carry out a
study of the informal sector with a view to develop a pilot
small enterprise project.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
The Economy
2.01      The latest comprehensive Bank Economic Report on Senegal (212-SE)
is dated August 15, 1973. A special study on the financial situation of
Senegal (778-SE) was published in June 1975. A basic economic mission is
scheduled to take place toward the end of 1976.



-2-
2.02      Senegal covers an area of about 76,000 square miles (200,000
square kilometers) in the most western part of the sahelian belt. The
country's climate is typical of the area: a long dry season (up to nine
months in the North) and limited rainfall in many regions which is subject
to considerable annual fluctuations, particularly in the North and the
Center. The vegetation is characterized by fine grassland in the North,
open forest in the center and subtropical forest in the South.
2.03      Senegal's population totaling about 5.0 million inhabitants is
currently growing at an annual rate of some 2.7%. It is predominantly
rural; some 70% of the country's inhabitants make their living in agricul-
ture and livestock and another 5% in fishing. About 70% of the population
live in villages of less than 10,000 inhabitants.
2.04      Between 1960 and 1974, GDP increased by about 2.2% per annum in
real terms, as compared with a population growth of 2.1%. In the first
five to seven years after independence, the slow growth was due to the
difficult process of adaptation to the more limited economic, political
and administrative role of the country as compared to its pre-independence
role as the capital of French West Africa. The economic stagnation that
prevailed in subsequent years was due mainly to unfavorable weather con-
ditions, with severe drought occuring four times between 1967 and 1973.
A good rainfall in 1974 brought a sharp expansion of groundnut production
during the 1974/1975 crop season. This increase coupled with the conti-
nuation of high export prices for groundnut products and phosphates had
a favorable impact not only on the groundnut processing industry but also
on other sectors of the economy as we]Ll as on the overall financial perform-
ance during 1975. However, more recently, a sharp decline in the world
prices of groundnuts and phosphates has had a very negative impact on the
country's economy despite the record 1975/76 harvest.
2.05      GNP per capita in 1975 was approximately $370.  However there
is a wide discrepancy between the per capita income of the 70% of Senegal's
population living in the rural sector estimated at about a fifth of per
capita income of the indigenous urban population.
2.06      Agriculture plays a significant role in Senegal's economic life,
as it employs about 70% of the labor force. Although accounting for only
25% of GDP, it has high leverage on the economy through its impact on
exports and the size of the domestic demand for locally-produced goods and
services. Groundnuts is by far the most important cash crop, accounting
for 35% of exports. Commerce is also a significant activity accounting for
more than 21% of GDP, while industry represents also 21%, construction 4%,
transport about 7% and other services including the Government also 21%.



2.07      The distribution of recorded employment among the various sectors
is as follows:

Statistique, Situation Economigue du Senegal 1973.
Manufacturing accounts for 29% of recorded employment, commerce, hotels and
restaurants 22% and transport and communications 20%.
2.08      In 1970, 1971 and 1972 Senegal had balance of payments current
account deficits of CFAF 5.8, 8.9 and 4.2 billion respectively. In 1973,
the deficit increased sharply to CFAF 21 billion due to a number of unfavor-
able factors. Production during the 1972/1973 and 1973/74 crop seasons was
adversely affected by severe drought conditions, which resulted in a 30%
reduction in the volume of exports in 1973 while the terms of trade remained
at their depressed level. At the same time, the bad harvest necessitated
emergency imports of food grains. As a result, while during the preceding
years the overall balance of payments recorded surpluses as the merchandise
trade deficits were more than covered by net inflows on transfers, capital
accounts and net receipts from services, in 1973 it registered a deficit of
CFAF 9.8 billion. In 1974 and 1975 the current account deficit was more in
line with preceding years, due to a better harvest and increase in the price
of phosphates, Senegal's second largest export product. However, the overall
balance still had a deficit of CFAF 0.9 billion in 1974 and 3.4 billion in
1975. The 1976 overall balance of payments is not expected to show a con-
siderable improvement.
2.09      The Fourth Development Plan (July 1973-July 1977) presently being
implemented, was revised at the beginning of 1975. Total investments during
that period that were initially planned to be about CFAF 181 billion are now
expected to reach CFAF 324 billion, a 79% increase due to a net increase in
the number of projects and higher than expected project costs. Investment
targets for industry have been revised upwards by 37%, from CFAF 20.1 billion



-4-
to CFAF 27.5 billion, while for tourism there was a 29% readjustment from
CFAF 17.8 billion to CFAF 23 billion; however it is considered unlikely
that these targets will be fully achieved.
The Industrial Sector
2.10      Following independence, in the early 1960's, the industrial sector
in Senegal (defined to comprise manufacturing as well as mining, energy and
production of construction materials) faced serious difficulties, due to the
loss of important export markets for manufactured products as local indus-
tries developed in other West African countries. Nevertheless, the annual
rate of growth of the sector reached 5.2% between 1960 and 1974. Its
share of GDP at constant factor cost increased from 13% in 1960 to about 20%
in 1974. The paragraphs below present information on manufacturing and min-
ing, followed by a review of the Government industrial policies.
2.11      Manufacturing.  The evolution of value added in manufacturing
between 1960 and 1974 is as follows:
Value Added in Manufacturing Sector at Factor Cost at Current Prices
(In billion CFA francs)
1960                1974
Groundnut oil production            3.90                  6.89

2.12       In 1974 foodstuffs and beverages accounted for about 30% of value
added in manufacturing; metal products, machinery and equipment for 7%;
textiles and leather for 15%. Production of groundnut oil for 19%.



- 5 -
2.13      During the 1960-1974 period, total value added in manufacturing
increased at an average annual rate of 6.6% or 4.7% in real terms. The
manufacturing activities that experienced the fastest growth were: grotnd-
nut refining, food industry, textiles, paper and printing, chemical in-
dustries. The significant increase in the share of chemicals is mainly due to
the establishment of an oil refinery and of a fertilizer plant, but also to
the price increase of oil.
2.14      Between 1969 and 1975 the value of production by manufacturing in-
creased at an annual rate of 5.4% in real terms.  The evolution between 1960 and
1974 of the value of production by manufacturing enterprises is presented below:

(i.e., with over 20-30 workers) by sector of activity is as follows:

TOTAL                                       342
Enterprises in the food industry account for about 25% of the total.



-6-
2.16      Most modern enterprises in Senegal are foreign-owned.  It is
estimated that 85% of industrial assets are still owned by French inves-
tors. Less than 10% of the 342 enterprises in the modern sector are owned
by Senegalese. In 1969, the Government created the Societe Nationale
di Etudes et de Promotion Industrielle! (SONEPI) for the purpose of encour-
aging Senegalese entrepreneurship. The Government has made several equity
investments in industrial companies, and is also buying participation in
key industries i.e., phosphate mines, groundnut refineries, etc. It en-
courages foreign investment but also seeks opportunities for Senegalese-
owned enterprises and joint Senegalese-foreign ventures.
2.17      The Government is implementing a "Senegalization" plan according
to which by 1981 all labor and supervisory jobs in new and existing indus-
trial enterprises, with the exception of top management and of experts of
unusual skills or qualifications, should be filled by Senegalese. Enter-
prises have been requested to submit to the Government a timetable for the
training of Senegalese and their replacement of expatriate staff.
2.18      Industry is heavily concentrated in Dakar and the Cap Vert region.
About 80% of industrial production and employment are in this area. Some
industries are also located in Thies and Sine Saloum. Because of the dif-
ference in infrastructure and the difiEiculty in finding skilled manpower in
the interior decentralization of industry is not likely to occur in the near
future; however the Government has emphasized the importance of achieving a
regional balance in industrial development and has provided encouragement for
such decentralization under the Investment Code (see paras. 2.23-2.27).
2.19      Gross domestic investment in manufacturing which averaged only
CFAF 2.3 billion annually in 1962-1967 has recently increased considerably;
in 1972 it exceeded CFAF 6 billion.
2.20      Manufacturing is expected to grow at an annual rate of 7% in the
next Eive years. Activities that are expected to develop more rapidly are
textiles, construction materials and fish canning. Major obstacles to the
development of Senegal's manufacturing sector are the narrowness of the
domestic market in which the already low level of income is subject to
important fluctuations originating in the agricultural sector, the cost
of power and water the small scale of a number of manufacturing enter-
prises, and a shortage of technical and managerial skills.
2.21      Mining.  The share of mining, essentially phosphates, in Senegal's
GDP (at constant factor cost) increased from 0.2% in 1960 to 2.2% in 1974,
and value added in mining is expected to increase at an annual rate of about
12% and to account for almost 3% of GDP by 1980.

Government Industrial Policies
2.22      The main objectives of the Government for industry as expressed in
the Fourth Development Plan are to:
. obtain at least a 6.5% increase of industrial pro-
duction at constant prices;
. encourage private entrepreneurship through tax and
custom duty advantages;
. encourage decentralization to help regional develop-
ment;
. train and promote local entrepreneurs so that they
participate in the country's industrialization effort;
. promote agro-industries and mining industries;
, give high priority to labor intensive industries to
help solve the unemployment problem in urban areas;
*develop export oriented industries;
. develop the air, sea and rail transportation network
to facilitate the shipment of products for exports.
2.23      The Investment Code, enacted in 1962 was revised in 1965 and 1972.
It guarantees to foreign investors the free repatriation of their invested
capital and earnings. Moreover it grants special advantages to two catego-
ries of enterprises: the "priority enterprises" and the "concessionaire
firms". Priority enterprises are defined as those investing at least CFAF 40
million or creating employment for at least 40 nationals. These requirements
are cut in half for enterprises settling outside the Cap Vert region. The
main advantages offered to priority enterprises include tax holidays, import
duty exemptions, state participation in infrastructure expenditures for water
and electricity, and special tariffs for water and electricity consumptions.
2.24      To qualify as a "concessionaire firm", an applicant must fulfill
the conditions of a "priority firm " and its investment program be considered
particularly important for the development of the country. In addition
to the advantages offered to a priority firm, the concessionaire firm may
be granted a long-term plan (up to 20 years) of fiscal and/or customs duties
exemptions.
2.25      A new Investment Code adopted in the Spring of 1972, extends the
fiscal and customs advantages, presently granted to large industrial firms
only, to agricultural and tourism enterprises, as well as to small- and
medium-size locally-owned firms.



-8-
2.26      Nearly all firms established since 1962 (the date of the old
Investment Code) in the manufacturing sector have been granted Investment
Code benefits, either in the form of a priority agreement or Convention
Status. By the end of July 1975, 177 firms had received Investment Code
concessions.
2.27      Senegal's tariff system inherited from the colonial regime has
not been revised and simplified, while a large number of changes have been
introduced in a very ad hoc manner.  The result is a complicated system
with numerous special cases and exceptions. There are four types of duties,
ranging from 4 to 25%, several of which can be imposed on the same import
transaction.
2.28      Most of the levies applied to Senegalese exports resemble those
on imports discussed above. Only a limited range of goods actually bear
export duties, and 90% of export tax receipts are from groundnut products,
especially crude and refined oil.
2.29      In Senegal, two types of .import controls are in use:  a general
control of all imports from countries other than the EEC and the Franc Zone
and controls relating to specific products. The general control of non-EEC
and non-Franc Zone imports operates through the fixing of an annual quota
of total imports from these countries.
2.30      Industrial, commercial and agricultural enterprises are subject
to a flat 33.3% tax on net profits.
2.31      In 1965 a law was introduced giving the Government the power to
control the prices of all goods and services. At that time the prices of
some locally produced foodstuffs, petroleum products and certain services
were controlled under the new law. In 1968, all prices and margins were
frozen as an anti-inflationary measure in connection with devaluation of
the French franc to which the CFA franc is tied. Gradually there has been
a general relaxation of price controls except for about 20 products for
which the frozen prices and margins are strictly observed. These are di-
rectly related to the cost of living of the Senegalese population.
2.32      An industrial duty free zone in Dakar has been created. So far,
several enterprises have been accepted for settlement in the Zone. Moreover,
with the assistance from KfW, an industrial zone will be established near
Dakar, specifically for small enterprises.
2.33      SONEPI was created in 1969 by the Government to assist in the
development of local enterprises, particularly small- and medium-size
companies. It has a fund for equity investments and a fund to guarantee
loans granted by banks to enterprises. Detailed information on SONEPI
is presented in paragraphs 2.57 and 2.58.

Tourism
2.34       Senegal's assets for the development of international tourism
include attractive beaches, pleasant climatic conditions from mid-November
to mid-June, a rich folklore and reasonable accessibility from Western
Europe and America. The Government is putting high priority on the develop-
ment of the sector and apart from participating in the financing of hotels
has provided incentives to hotel investors through the Investment Code.
2.35      Estimates of number of tourists visiting Senegal for 1970, actual
data for 1972 and 1974, and projected results for 1977, the last year of
the Fourth Development Plan, are as follows:

1/   Fourth Development Plan revised objectives.
2.36      Tourist arrivals increased by about 10% a year between 1968 and
1970 and by 39% between 1970 and 1972. The sudden and sharp upturn during
the 1971/72 season was reflected in overcrowded hotels, hectic activities
of tour operators and a marked increase in new hotel construction. Between
1972 and 1974 tourist arrivals continued to grow at a high 34% a year; an
annual growth rate of 19% is expected between 1974 and 1977 when about
213,000 tourists would visit the country.



-- 10 -
2.37      Hotel bed occupancies in Dakar average 55% corresponding to room
occupancies of 75% due to the low dc,uble occupancy factor (1.5) attributable
to the large portion of business-motivated travel. Even higher occupancy
levels are attained in the vacation villages along the coast. Gross income
from tourism represented about 2% of merchandise exports in 1970, 3.1% in
1972 and about 6.5% in 1974. This proportion is expected to increase to
about 20% by 1980.
2.38      Initially the Fourth Development Plan called for investment in
tourism of CFAF 17.8 billion between July 1973 and July 1977. In 1975 this
forecast was readjusted upward to CFAF 21 billion. As the number of pro-
jects that were anticipated during that period has been reduced from 60
to 54, the anticipated rise in total investments is due to higher construc-
tion costs.
2.39      A plan for the tourism development of the Petite-Cote area was
appraised by the Bank in December 1975, and the proposed project will be
presented for Board approval during FY1977. The plan forecasts that by
1980 about 650 beds will be available in this area, 2,500 by 1983 and 5,000
beds by 1990 when the two phases of the project are expected to be completed.
The total cost of the infrastructure works for the first phase that extends
from 1976 through 1983 is expected to reach about US$16.8 million (net of
taxes), including a 250-bed pilot hotel to be built in the early stages of
the first phase.
The Financial Environment
2.40      Senegal is a member of the West African Monetary Union established
in 1962 and composed of six countries with a common central bank, the BCEAO.
Established banking and credit institutions in Senegal include four commer-
cial banks (BICIS, BIAO, SGBS, USB), an agricultural development bank (BNDS),
two medium- and long-term finance development banks (SOFISEDIT and BSK), and
with relatively limited roles, SONEPI and SONAGA. FNCB has recently begun
operations in Senegal offering medium- and long-term finance.
Interest Rates and BCEAO Rules
2.41      Interest rates and credit distribution are controlled by BCEAO
through the discount system. BCEAO initiated in 1975 a number of fundamental
reforms including:
(1) tying the Monetary Union's interest rate policy more closely
to the money markets in Europe to reduce the flow of local
savings out of Senegal, as well as the incentive for foreign
enterprises to obtain cheap local finances;



- 11 -
(2) linking the credit allocation available through discounting
to national sectoral needs;
(3) forming a regional money market where liquid funds
of the financial institutions could be placed;
(4) encouraging the national enterprises to seek access to
credit.
2.42      Rates of interest charged by banks on short- and medium-term
lending are controlled by BCEAO primarily through the discount rates; banks
charge clients varying spreads over the discount rate depending on the risk
involved. Since July 1975 BCEAO has offered a preferential discount rate of
5.5% for agricultural short-term financing, national SSE's (defined as SSE's
with outstanding borrowings below CFAF 20 million) and loans to individuals
for housing. The discount rate was increased from 5.5% to 8% for all other
operations and the maximum term of discounts was increased from seven to
ten years. The spread allowed on such short- and medium-term discounts
varied between 3% and a maximum 5% dependent on credit risk. Interest rates
offered on term deposits vary from 3.25% to 6.50% depending on size and
term, and are also fixed by BCEAO.
2.43      Prior to January 1, 1976 BCEAO determined an annual discount ceiling
for each country, within the Monetary Union and then allocated discount ceil-
ings to individual banks and enterprises. BCEAO has now introduced a revised
system whereby the individual discount ceilings to banks will be withdrawn;
instead, in conjunction with Governments in each member country, priority sec-
tors for discounting will be delineated. A BCEAO review committee will evalu-
ate the suitability of a project for discounting against these priorities.
Discounts to banks by BCEAO will not be automatic and BCEAO may only offer
partial discounts in both term and amount depending on the sectoral priorities
of the projects. BCEAO discounting limits for medium-term loans, which are
generally used to finance local costs and cover the import component of an
investment where external finance is not available, will continue at existing
levels i.e., up to 90% of project cost for national SSE's, 65% for industrial
enterprises and 50% for other projects. There will also be a further require-
ment that banks must utilize their own liquid resources for investments before
seeking discounts at BCEAO.
2.44      The effects of these changes in the BCEAO discounting procedures
are not yet apparent; however, it is considered likely that in the absence
of automatic discounts, the commercial banks will be hesitant to propose
projects requiring discountable funds for 7-10 years in case BCEAO refuses
their application and they have to use their own short-term deposits to
finance the projects. This may result in financial institutions with medium/
long term resources receiving an increased demand for their funds. Financial
institutions with strong evaluation/appraisal capability should be able to



- 12 -
demonstrate through their analyses why their projects are of high economic
priority to Senegal and therefore improve the likelihood of their receiving
discountable funds from BCEAO.
2.45      The on-lending rates for long-term funds are indirectly influ-
enced by BCEAO through its membership on the boards of development banks
mad long-term finance institutions although the cost of such funds from
external sources, is normally the major determinant of the on-lending rate.
-\ tax (Taxe de Prestation de Services) is charged by Government on internal
Lncome at a rate of 9.29% and is collected by the banks. SOFISEDIT's loans
are exempted from such tax until 1980.
Development Banks
2.46      In addition to SOFISEDIT, there are three other banks offering
term finance for development. BNDS operates predominantly in the agricul-
tural sector (see para. 2.47). BSK and FNCB offer term finance for indus-
trial and tourism projects; however as of December 1975 both banks have
limited project appraisal capabilities and both are offering funds from
Eurodollar sources at floating interesst rates (see para. 5.13).
X.47      Banque Nationale de Developpement du Senegal (BNDS).  BNDS, estab-
lished in 1964, has a share capital of CFAF 2.4 billion owned by the Sene-
galese Government (73%), CCCE (16%), BCEAO (6%) and three other institutions
(5,).  Short-term loans represent about 84% of total portfolio, while medium-
term loans account for 13% and long-t:erm loans for 3%. As of September 30,
1975, its medium- and long-term loan portfolio amounted to approximately
CFAF 6.3 billion, while equity investments totaled CFAF 852 million. Approxi-
mately 65% of BNDS operations are in the agricultural sector, 15% in industry
and the remaining 20% in trade, mortgage financing and individual loans for
household equipment and automobile. BNDS provides about 60% of the short-term
groundnut crop credit, the rest being/ supplied by the commercial banks. After
suffering a loss of CFAF 61 million in 1970/71, BNDS has had modest profits
every year. In 1975, it made a net profit of CFAF 42 million. BNDS employees
total 250.
2.48      Banque Senegalo-Koweitienne (BSK).  BSK was created in 1974 as a
ioint venture between Senegal and Kuwait. It has a share capital of CFAF 1
billion owned by the Senegalese Government (20%), a private Senegalese
Investor (30%) and the Kuwait Foreign Trading and Contracting Company (KFTC)
(50%). Although BSK was created as an investment/development bank, it is
authorized to carry out commercial bank activities. In September 1975, BSK's
sight deposits totaled CFAF 764 million and term deposits CFAF 1.1 billion.
At that same time, BSK short-term loans outstanding amounted to CFAF 466 mil-
lion.
2.49      So far, BSK has approved two medium-term loans; one of US$900,000
to a company that is to build an hotel in the Saint-Louis area. The loan
which has an interest rate of LIBOR +- 3% was made for 10 years with a 3-year
grace period. The other loan of CFAE' 1 billion with a 10-year maturity
was made to a company that will operate in the industrial duty-free zone.



- 13 -
Commercial Banks
2.50      Senegalese commercial banks have used their short-term deposits
predominantly for short-term lending; their medium-term lending has been
financed by the small amount of term deposits attracted and more generally
by rediscounting at the Central Bank. Because rediscounts up to a certain
annual ceiling for each commercial bank, tended to be automatic until
1976, in depth project analyses were not normally required and consequently
the commercial banks have only limited project appraisal capabilities (see
para. 2.43).
2.51      Union Senegalaise de Banque pour le Commerce et l'Industrie (USB).
USB, was established in 1961 to take over Credit Lyonnais' activities in
Senegal. Its share capital of CFAF 1 billion is distributed among the
Government (32% directly and 19% held by BNDS), Credit Lyonnais (37%) and
three German, Italian and US banks (about 4% each). As of September 30,
1975 sight deposits at USB amounted to CFAF 10.8 billion and term deposits
CFAF 2.3 billion. At that same time its short-term loans outstanding totaled
CFAF 10.9 billion while medium- and long-term loans amounted to CFAF 804
million.
2.52      USB was granted two lines of credit from KfW (CFAF 300 million)
and the African Development Bank (CFAF 400 million) to finance small- and
medium-size projects in industry and services. USB has had difficulties
in utilizing these lines of credit.
2.53      Banque Internationale pour le Commerce et l'Industrie du Senegal
(BICIS). With a share capital of CFAF 750 million, BICIS is 37% owned by
the French Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and 51% by Societe Financiere
pour les Pays d'Outre-Mer (SFOM) which has among its shareholders BNP, Bank
of America, Banque Lambert, Dresdner Bank and Banca d'America e d'Italia.
Private Senegalese shareholders own the remaining 12%. As of September 30,
1975, BICIS sight deposits amounted to about CFAF 11.5 billion while term
deposits were CFAF 2.2 billion. At the same time its short-term loans
outstanding amounted to CFAF 9.7 billion while medium- and long-term
loans were CFAF 2.2 billion.
2.54      Societe Generale de Banques au Senegal (SGBS).  SGBS is a subsi-
diary of French Societe Generale. It has a share capital of CFAF 825 million,
10% of which is owned by private Senegalese investors. As of September 30,
1975, sight deposits at SGBS amounted to CFAF 9.8 billion and term deposits
were CFAF 1.6 billion. At that same time total loans outstanding amounted
to CFAF 11.2 billion.
2.55      Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique Occidentale (BIAO).  With a
share capital of CFAF 66 million BIAO is owned by First National City Bank
(49%) and the French Compagnie Financiere France Afrique. As of June 30,
1976, sight deposits at BIAO amounted to CFAF 9.7 billion and term deposits
were CFAF 3.3 billion. At that same time, short-term loans amounted to
CFAF 11.4 billion while medium- and long-term loans were CFAF 1.2 billion.



- 14 -
Financial/Promotional Institutions
2.56      These institutions are the Societe Nationale d'Etudes et de
Promotion Industrielle (SONEPI), the Societe Nationale de Garantie et
d'Assistance au Commerce (SONAGA) and the Societe Nationale de Promotion
du Tourisme (SNPT).
2.57      The Societe Nationale d'Etudes et de Promotion Industrielle
(SONEPI). SONEPI was established in 1969 as a predominantly public cor-
poration with a share capital of CFAF 55 million of which the Government
has 24%, BNDS 23%, the Central Bank 18%, USB 4%, and the other commercial
banks 2% each; the remaining 25% is evenly distributed among seventy com-
panies established in Senegal. SONEPI's primary objective is the develop-
ment of small- and medium-scale industrial enterprises controlled by Sene-
galese. To this end, SONEPI makes feasibility studies of selected indus-
trial projects, seeks Senegalese investors to sponsor feasible projects
it has identified, and assists them in project development, organization
and management, improvement in methods of production and in providing
finance and acts as technical counselor of the Government for policies
regarding Senegalese entrepreneurship. SONEPI has also been used by the
Government to analyse industrial projects applying for incentives under
the Investment Code.
2.58      Assistance to Small Senegalese Enterprises.  SONEPI's assistance
has been given in the three following forms:
(a) Equity Participations and Guarantees. To ease difficulties
for small Senegalese enterprises to have access to credit
from commercial banks SONEPI was endowed at the end of 1970
by FAC, Caisse Centrale and the Government with two funds
totaling CFAF 50 million: an "equity participation fund"
and a "guarantee fund". This amount was subsequently in-
creased to CFAF 100 million of which CFAF 75 million for
the participation fund and CFAF 25 million for the guaran-
tee fund. These funds are almost fully committed. KfW is
in the process of making CFAF 85 million available for the
participation fund.
(b) Management Training. SONEPI's role in training Senegalese
entrepreneurs is particularly interesting. A specific de-
partment with five professionals under the guidance of a
UNIDO expert gives technical assistance to about sixty en-
terprises; special training courses of ten weekly morning
or evening sessions are also organized for entrepreneurs
in order to give them an elementary knowledge of business
management, including shop organization, bookkeeping, and
calculation of costs. All applicants for equity participa-
tions and guarantees from SONEPI must enroll in these courses.



- 15 -
(c)  Industrial Estates for Small-scale Industry.  SONEPI has
so far created a small industrial estate in Thies where
ten small enterprises are now established. These com-
panies have experienced difficulties, mainly because of
lack of continuous assistance but they are now improving.
Another industrial estate is to be created soon in Dakar,
to be followed by one in Kaolack. The objective is to
have an industrial zone in each regional capital before
1980.
2.59      Other Institutions.  Two other institutions were created by the
Government: (a) Societe Nationale de Garantie et d'Assistance au Commerce
(SONAGA) which gives accounting assistance and manages a guarantee fund for
loans to Senegalese-owned commercial and transport enterprises; and (b)
Societe Nationale de Promotion de Tourisme (SNPT) which manages the port-
folio of Government's minority participations in hotel companies in Senegal,
and undertakes feasibility studies of hotel projects.
2.60      In order to learn more about the Small Scale Entreprise sector
in Senegal, and in particular about firms in the informal artisanal sub-
sector, the loan to SOFISEDIT includes $200,000 for assistance to SONEPI
to develop for the future an integrated scheme for assisting small scale
Senegalese entrepreneurs. With the advice and assistance of the IBRD the
resources will be used by SONEPI to: (1) consolidate and evaluate the re-
sults of ongoing statistical studies of the small scale sector being carried
out by ILO and the Government; (2) draw up alternative methods to meet the
financial and technical assistance needs of local entrepreneurs; (3) design
and test Et small pilot project to deliver in a controlled environment the
necessary inputs. Given the work in progress in Senegal, the Bank and SONEPI
estimate that a study/pilot project, as described above and lasting two years
can be implemented for CFAF 60 million. The Bank will finance about three
quarters of this amount (i.e. $200,000) with the remaining CFAF 15 million
borne by the Government. The Bank contribution will be passed on by SOFISEDIT
to SONEPI with the Government responsible for the commitment fee, interest and
principal repayment.
III. THE COMPANY
Background
3.01      SOFISEDIT was created by the Government of Senegal in March 1974
to provide term financing for industry and tourism development. The World
Bank Group assisted the Government in establishing the new institution:
IFC made an equity investment of about US$230,000 and the Bank granted a
US$3 million loan during that same year. To recruit the initial staff and
to find office space took several months and the company did not start
operations until November 1974.



- 16 -
Ownership
3.02      SOFISEDIT has an authorized share capital of CFAF 650 million
(approximately US$3 million) subscribed by the Government of Senegal and
Senegalese public sector institutions (34%), the Banque Centrale des.Etats
de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (12%), three private commercial banks operating
in Senegal (7.7% each), Caisse Centrale, DEG and IFC (7.7% each), private
Senegalese investors (6%) and Fidelity Bank (1.5%). A list of current share-
holders is provided in Annex 1.
Board of Directors
3.03      The Board consists of twelve members listed in Annex 2.  The
Chairman of the Board Mr. Ibrahima Nldiaye, is also SOFISEDIT's President
and Director General. He was selected by the Senegalese Government.
Directors represent the Central Bank, the Ministries of Finance and of
Planning, IFC, DEG and CCCE, the four commercial banks, and BNDS. The
Board meets four times a year and reviews all projects.
Management
3.04      Mr. Ndiaye, SOFISEDIT's President and Director General was pre-
viously head of the Office of Post and Telecommunications in Senegal. The
Deputy Director General, Mr. Mombru, is a member of the Bank DFC Department
originally seconded to SOFISEDIT for a two-year term. The Director of Invest-
ment, Mr. Jetha, had been recruited by the Bank for that specific assignment
also for a two-year term. Messrs. Mombru and Jetha have contributed signifi-
cantly to the good start made by SOFISEDIT. At the request of SOFISEDIT and
the Government, their secondment which was due to expire in mid-1976 has been
extended by one year to mid-1977 so that they can continue the training and
development of the staff.
Organization and Staff
3.05      SOFISEDIT's staff totals twenty-one of whom three are managers
and six professionals. SOFISEDIT's organization chart is attached as
Annex 3. It includes an Investment D)epartment, headed by Mr. Jetha, in
charge of project appraisal, implementation and follow-up, and an Adminis-
trative Services/Accounting Department supervised by the Deputy Director
General. The Investment Department iincludes two economists, two financial
analysts and one engineer. The Administrative Services/Accounting Depart-
ment includes one accountant and one assistant accountant. The existing
staffing and organization is adequate for the expected level of operations
until 1979.
Policy Statement
3.06       SOFISEDIT's policy statement attached as Annex 4 was prepared
with the Bank Group's assistance. It limits the normal company's finan-
cial commitment (loans and participations) in favor of a single enterprise



- 17 -
to 20% of the company's paid-up share capital and reserves. Moreover,
SOFISEDIT's participation in the share capital of a single enterprise does
not normally exceed 15% of the company's own share capital and reserves and
total investments in the form of equity participation may not exceed 75% of
the company's share capital and reserves.
Interest Rates
3.07      Rates charged by SOFISEDIT on loans for industry and tourism vary
between 11 and 13 percent for medium-term loans, the average rate being at
12%. For long-term loans the rate was raised to 12% in June 1976. To these
are added a commitment charge of 0.85% on the undisbursed portion of the loan.
The Government has assumed the foreign exchange risk on the first World Bank
Loan to SOFISEDIT which so far has been the only foreign borrowing, and will
also assurme it under the proposed second loan.
Procedures
3.08      SOFISEDIT's procedures for project appraisal, procurement and dis-
bursement have been spelled out in writing and are part of the Company's
Operational Manual. They are detailed and quite adequate. Procedures for
follow-up are in the process of being prepared. The manual also includes
internal accounting procedures.
3.09      (a)  Appraisals.  SOFISEDIT's project appraisals are of a very
good quality. This has been one of the main factors that has permitted the
company to make a good start and to be recognized as a sound institution by
the Senegalese Government, and the banking and business community.
3.10      (b)  Follow-up.  SOFISEDIT's portfolio consists of projects under
construction or projects which have only recently become operational. SOFISEDIT
visits its projects regularly and the promoter is required to keep the company
informed of the status of project implementation.
3.11      (c)  Procurement and Disbursement.  Although SOFISEDIT does not
usually require competitive bidding, the project promoters are requested to
solicit offers from various suppliers from which the company and the pro-
moter select the most favorable. Before SOFISEDIT disburses its financing,
it requires that the promoter first pays its share of the investment. Funds
are then disbursed against presentation of invoices.
Promotional Activities
3.12      Since it started operating at the end of 1974 SOFISEDIT has con-
centrated in appraising projects that were already at fairly advanced stages
of preparation. Consequently, it did not have the time nor felt the need
to be actively engaged in promotional activities. The situation is already
somewhat different and the need for devoting staff resources to these activi-
ties is starting to be felt. SOFISEDIT's management has prepared and submitted



- 18 -
to the Bank a program of promotional activities which will be partly oriented
toward small-scale enterprises.
Auditors
3.13      SOFISEDIT's accounts are presently being reviewed and audited by
Fiduciaire France-Afrique, a leading audit firm in Senegal. The quality
of the first audit that was related to the accounts of the company as of
September 30, 1975 is satisfactory.
IV. OPERATIONS AND FINANCE
Operations
4.01      From inception to June 30, 1976, SOFISEDIT has approved nineteen
loans totalling CFAF 1,361 million and five equity investments totaling
CFAF 86.5 million. At the same date, loans totalling CFAF 503 million had
been committed and CFAF 341.2 million disbursed whilst equity investments
totaling CFAF 78.5 million had been committed and CFAF 61.9 million disbursed.
4.02      Annexes 5 to 8 provide details on the projects including overall
financing plans and economic rates of return. Sixty-eight percent of the
projects' total costs are financed by loans, twenty-seven by equity and five
percent by internal cash generation. SOFISEDIT loans approved represent
approximately 42% of total lending and 28% of overall project costs. SOFISEDIT
equity investments in the above projects amount to approximately 5% of total
equity approved. Of the nineteen projects approved, thirteen are new proj-
ects, five are for expansion of existing facilities and one is for moderniza-
tion. Ten projects are in industry, seven in tourism, one in fisheries and
one in mining. The projects range in size from total costs of CFAF 9 million
to CFAF 725 million.
4.03      The nineteen projects will create 1,130 new jobs at an average cost/
job of US$19,000. The expected value added per year in production amounts
to CFAF 2,222 million and the annual net gain in foreign exchange for Senegal
is estimated at CFAF 1,769 million. Economic rates of return of the projects
financed range from 11% to 50%. The average maturity for medium-term loans
is approximately seven years and for long-term loans ten years.
4.04      Under the first US$3 million Bank loan No. 987-SE, five projects
have already been approved for a sum amounting to US$1,852,000. An amount
of US$370,000 has been approved to partially finance the cost of the two
expatriates currently working with SOFISEDIT (see Organization and Staff).
The sum of US$502,000 was approved for the PSOA project which is a process
to make chemical plaster from a phospho-gypsum by-product of a local fertil-
izer manufacturing plant. PSOA's financial rate of return is forecast at 17%
and the economic rate of return 23%. The third project for which a sum of



- 19 -
US$400,000 was approved is for a new 50 double room hotel being sponsored by a
Senegalese majority-owned company which has a forecast financial and economic
return of about 12%. The fourth project (US$305,000) is for the expansion of
a brewery and soft drink factory.  The projected economic rate of return is
above 50%. The fifth project (US$275,000) concerns the expansion of a textile
company using locally produced cotton. Forecast financial and economic rates
of return are about 30%. A sixth project (US$530,000) in the hotel sector is
under review.
Financial Performance and Position
4.05      Annexes 9 and 10 show SOFISEDIT's Balance Sheets and Income State-
ments as of September 30, 1975 and June 30, 1976. The accounts for the
first eighteen months of operations (March 1974 to September 30, 1975) show a
loss of CFAF 2.5 million which was mainly due to high personnel costs being
incurred. Professional staff members were more than required by the level of
operations; however, no further professional staff are expected to be hired
until 1979. Also, inflation in Senegal in 1974 of approximately 25% resulted
in SOFISEDIT having to increase salaries significantly to remain competitive
with other institutions. Personnel costs represented 60% of the total costs
of CFAF 58 million during this start up period. A further CFAF 16 million was
spent on fixtures and the fitting out of SOFISEDIT's offices. Financial costs
during this period amounted to only CFAF 0.5 million due to the limited use of
debt to finance the operations.
4.06      For the period October 1, 1975 to June 30, 1976 the accounts show
a further loss of CFAF 15 million, mainly due to continuing high personnel
costs. Income from loans increased significantly during that period and
accounted for 55% of income versus 4% during the preceding eighteen-months
period.
4.07      As of June 30, 1976 SOFISEDIT is in a creditworthy position, with
a net working capital of approximately CFAF 342 million. With the portfolio
being still small the debt/equity ratio of SOFISEDIT is insignificant.
Portfolio
4.08      The projects in the portfolio are either under construction or
just beginning operations and as a consequence, it is too early to evaluate
their performance. As of June 1976, there was no evidence to indicate any
of the projects might encounter serious problems in the near future, and
as a consequence, therefore, no provisions have been made.
Resources
4.09       SOFISEDIT's resources as of June 30, 1976 totaled CFAF 1,202 million
(US$5.3 million) (Annex 11). They were CFAF 610 million equity subscription
of which CFAF 100 million was subscribed in foreign exchange and the first
Bank loan of US$3 million. At that date, the company had used CFAF 482
million for loans, equity investments and fixed assets and committed CFAF
178.5 million. Resources available for commitments amounted to CFAF 541.2
million (US2.4 million) of which CFAF 371.8 million (US$1.6 million) in
foreign exchange.

V. PROSPECTS
Business Outlook
5.01      The business climate prevailing in Senegal is conducive to indus-
trial investments. The country's political stability, the Government's
encouragement of private investments, substantial incentives for foreign and
local investors have been and will probably continue to be favorable factors.
Serious efforts are being made to encourage the development of export-oriented
industries as evidenced by the creation of the Industrial Duty Free Zone. As
the production cost level is high and the exchange rate is tied to the French
Franc, the development of these industries can be stimulated only by special
incentives which the Government is considering. Other constraints that may
affect the growth of the industrial sector in coming years include Senegal's
extreme dependence on groundnut production which results in wide fluctuations
in the level of domestic demand, the narrowness of the domestic market and the
shortage of technical and managerial skills.
5.02      Developments on the international economic scene have had both
favorable and unfavorable impacts on Senegal's economy; in 1974 higher costs
of imports were counterbalanced by a sizeable increase in the prices of
phosphates and groundnuts. However, the recent decline in the world prices
for these commodities has created problems for the Government. The longer
term prospects for the Senegalese economy are good.
5.03      Forecast industrial and tourism investments for the period 1976-1980
and the expected financing to be provided by SOFISEDIT are as follows:

- 21 -
5.04      SOFISEDIT's contribution to the development of industry and tourism
is expected to increase gradually between 1974/75 and 1979/80.
5.05      Industrial activities that are expected to expand in coming years
include mining, textile and construction materials, fish canning, metal
products and machinery. In order to be successful most important industrial
investments would have to be export-oriented.
The Company's Strategy
5.06      The major constraints that SOFISEDIT is facing in its role of devel-
opment bank are basically those faced by the industrial sector itself. The
major obstacles include the shortage of qualified local entrepreneurs aggra-
vated by an absence of capital accumulation by interested project promoters.
The result is that the sector continues to be dominated by foreigners and that
the development of a Senegalese industrial base is very difficult to achieve.
5.07      In view of the above constraint SOFISEDIT's strategy, as outlined
in a document submitted to the Bank, will include assistance to Senegalese
entrepreneurs where appropriate during project preparation and through the
financing of projects. The time and effort expanded by SOFISEDIT at present
in assisting particularly the smaller Senegalese entrepreneurs should be care-
fully weighed against the need for SOFISEDIT to quickly build up its portfolio
and achieve profitability. SOFISEDIT will also carefully coordinate its
assistance to Senegalese entrepreneurs with SONEPI (see paras. 2.58, 2.59 and
2.60).
5.08      SOFISEDIT's strategy should also include the continuing develop-
ment of its relations with the business community and other financial insti-
tutions, so that SOFISEDIT may actively promote projects and mobilize local
savings into productive investments. SOFISEDIT should continue to actively
seek and develop relationships with alternative sources of foreign exchange
to the Bank (para. 5.12). Internally SOFISEDIT must continue to expand the
development finance expertise of its staff.
Forecast Operations
5.09      As of June 30, 1976 SOFISEDIT had a pipeline of twenty projects
under study amounting to a total investment of CFAF 6.1 billion. These are
presented in Annex 12. The potential SOFISEDIT investment in these projects
amounted to CFAF 1.5 billion in medium- and long-term loans and CFAF 96 mil-
lion in equity investments. Five of the projects requiring a total invest-
ment of CFAF 2.5 billion are for tourism; the remainder include projects in
the chemical, textile, fishing, leather and food industries. Fifteen of the
projects will have Senegalese majority ownership. Four of the projects are
in the small-and medium-scale range requiring individual total investments
of less than CFAF 100 million. Only four of the projects are expansions of
existing business. There is another pipeline of projects presented in Annex
13 which might be financed by SOFISEDIT during the period 1977-1980; it in-
cludes 34 projects involving a total investment of CFAF 14.6 billion. The



- 22 -
possible investment by SOFISEDIT in these projects amounts to CFAF 3 billion
in loans and CFAF 200 million in equity investments. If these investments
materialize, SOFISEDIT will have rapidly developed its position as a major
source of term finance to the industrial and tourism sectors of Senegal.
Resource Requirements
5.10      Assumptions for SOFISEDIT's forecast requirements are shown in
Annex 14, while Annexes 15 to 19 show SOFISEDIT's operations and financial
performance through September 30, 1980.
5.11      SOFISEDIT's existing sources of foreign exchange as of June 1976,
to finance long-term loans, amounted to CFAF 692 million and included a
CFAF 100 million foreign exchange equity subscription plus the first Bank
loan of CFAF 592 million. SOFISEDIT's long-term lending requirements
based on commitments, from inception to December 31, 1978 amount to CFAF
1,996 million. SOFISEDIT's existing resources will last until approximately
December 1976 and thereafter there will be a resource gap of US$5.9 million
to December 31, 1978. Of the proposed Bank loan, US$4 million would meet
approximately two-thirds of SOFISEDIT's long-term foreign exchange resource
gap to December 31, 1978, and a third will have to come from other sources.
5.12      SOFISEDIT has made some progress in seeking alternative external
sources of funds other than the Bank and BCEAO. It has approached BOAD and
EIB and both institutions have reacted favorably to its request. They have
in principle accepted to provide financial assistance to SOFISEDIT in a near
future. KfW is also considering a loan to SOFISEDIT to finance small entre-
preneurs in an industrial estate to be created in Dakar.
Long-Term Interest Rates and Foreign Exchange Risk
5.13      Up to June 1976, SOFISEDIT charged an interest rate of 10.5% plus
commitment fee of 0.85% on long-term loans to the industrial and tourism
sectors with the Government carrying the foreign exchange risk. This rate
was inconsistent with prevailing medium- and long-term rates, and therefore
SOFISEDIT increased its long-term interest rate to 12% (plus a commitment
fee of 0.85%) on the following grounds:
(a)  Comparison vis-a-vis Medium-Term Discount Rates.
In Senegal tourism projects tend to require funds
for more than 15 years whereas many of the indus-
trial projects require funds for 8-12 years. For
industrial clients requiring 10-12 year money it
is important that the long-term rates be consistent
with the medium-term discount rates so that indus-
trial investors are not deterred by too high long-
term interest rate into seeking discounted funds
up to ten years from the Central Bank on unrealis-
tically tight debt service coverage ratios. In



- 23 -
fact 12% should not impair SOFISEDIT's competitive
position with these industrial investors. Also, in
recent instances where commercial banks have been
refused discounts by the Central Bank for clients
who would have been charged 11% on such funds, they
have increased the rate to between 12% and the maxi-
mum 13%, when required to use their own funds.
(b) Long-Term Finance Market. The competition to
SOFISEDIT in the long-term finance market is begin-
ning to increase. BSK has recently provided long-
term Eurodollar financing on two tourism projects
at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2-3% with the
foreign exchange risk being passed on. FNCB has
recently entered the market to offer similar long-
term Eurodollar financing. The LIBOR rate has varied
rapidly between 7.0% and 13.75% over the last two
years. Two other banks offering long-term foreign
exchange funds are believed to be considering enter-
ing the Senegalese market. At 10.5% SOFISEDIT was
offering term resources at a little below market
levels; however at 12% SOFISEDIT's long-term rate
should be competitive over the life of the loans,
with rates offered from Eurodollar sources.
(c) Inflation - Real Rate of Return. The Bank's general
assessment of inflation for the period 1975-1980
is about 7.5%-8%. The new 12% interest rate would
therefore provide a significant positive real rate
of interest.
(d) SOFISEDIT's Profitability. The SOFISEDIT Forecast
Profit and Loss Statement (Annex 16) indicates that
even by applying a 12% interest rate plus 0.85%
commitment fee from June 1976, the institution will
not become profitable until 1977 and not cover start
up losses until 1978. Given the increase in the
cost of Bank loans from 7.25% to 8.90%, it was neces-
sary to raise the lending rate to 12% to maintain a
spread similar to that under the first loan.
5.14      In line with Central Bank policy of granting lower discount rates
on short-and medium-funds to SSEs, SOFISEDIT intends to continue charging
a preferential rate of 11% for long-term funds to small-scale Senegalese
enterprises.
5.15      The foreign exchange risk on the first Bank Loan to SOFISEDIT was
borne by the Government. For the proposed second Loan, in view of industrial
investors' very limited experience of the risks involved in borrowing foreign



- 24 -
exchange and the possible adverse influence on SOFISEDIT's operations of pass-
ing the risk on Bank funds to SOFISEDIT's borrowers, the Government proposes
to continue bearing the risk.
Forecast Financial Results
5.16      The forecasts show SOFISEDIT losses increasing to CFAF 20 million
in 1976 before recovering to a small CFAF 2 million net profit in 1977;
thereafter net profits should show a steady growth, reaching CFAF 144 mil-
lion by 1980. These start-up losses are not large enough to significantly
reduce the equity base of SOFISEDIT or seriously impair the financial sound-
ness of the institution. The net profit rises from 0.1% of average total
assets in 1977 to 2.9% in 1980 whilst over the same period net profit on
average net work, rises from 0.3% to a satisfactory 9.9%. The forecast
profitability of SOFISEDIT through 1978 will be lower than that forecast in
the initial appraisal report. This is mainly due to the high personnel and
administrative costs being incurred by SOFISEDIT in the initial years of
operation (see para. 4.05). In 1976 administrative expenses are at the very
high level of 8.7% of average total assets but are forecast to fall to 1.8%
by 1980.
5.17      Present projections of the Company's financial performance indicate
that SOFISEDIT will exhaust its debt capacity in FY 78, under the existing
debt/equity limit of 3.1, at a time when it will have only just become prof-
itable. In order for SOFISEDIT to continue to expand its operations there-
after, either its paid-in share capiltal will have to be increased or its
debt/equity limit raised. If the shareholders, in particular the Senegalese
Government, are ready to finance a share capital increase during FY 78, it
will not be necessary to increase the debt limit at that time. However, the
projections in the Appraisal Report conservatively assume that shareholders
will require SOFISEDIT to operate profitably for two successive years (FY 77
and 78) before subscribing to a major share capital increase. This issue was
discussed with SOFISEDIT's management: and the Bank agreed to temporarily raise
SOFISEDIT's debt/equity limit to 4:1 between October 1, 1977 and June 30, 1979
to allow operations to expand. SOFISEDIT's management agreed to the principle
of a share capital increase, the amotnt and timing of which would be determined
on the basis of the FY 78 accounts.
5.18      The debt service coverage of SOFISEDIT remains tight throughout the
projection period, reaching only 1.5 by 1980. Both the Central Bank and World
Bank will be expecting repayments of funds on collection. Failures to collect
loans on due dates could result in a liquidity squeeze for SOFISEDIT as the
limited working capital now allowed by the Central Bank before discounting re-
duces SOFISEDIT's ability to cover non-payment of loans from current assets;
however, having required banks to use! their short-term liquidity before redis-
counting, it is probable that BCEAO will be flexible on repayment deferral
requests.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusions
6.01      After a slow start due to difficulties in finding appropriate
staff and adequate office space SOFISEDIT is now in the process of establi-
shing itself as an important factor on the financial scene in Senegal. It
now has a nucleus of qualified and motivated staff and the quality of its
appraisal reports has been noticed both by the banking community and Govern-
ment officials. It has developed very good relations with the Government.
6.02      There is still room for developing closer contacts with the
Senegalese business community in order to be more aware of their needs and
look for imaginative solutions to their problems. The promotion function
needs to be systematized and developed, and appropriate measures are being
taken to that effect.
6.03      Three factors enhance SOFISEDIT's potential role.  Firstly, as
a source of long-term finance (above ten years) SOFISEDIT's fixed interest
rate of 12% should be competitive over the life of the loan, with insti-
tutions offering floating Eurodollar based rates. Secondly, SOFISEDIT
offers a project appraisal expertise superior to that available from other
financial institutions. Through such appraisals SOFISEDIT should be able
to clearly demonstrate the financial and economic viability of projects
and thereby enhance the probability of a project receiving rediscounted
funds from the Central Bank under the new procedures. Thirdly, the removal
of automatic rediscounting could deter commercial banks from considering
projects requiring term finance of up to ten years; this should increase
the demand for such term funds from SOFISEDIT. Thus SOFISEDIT's operations
are expected to develop substantially over the next five years. Although
due to high initial overheads, SOFISEDIT will not reach profitability until
1977, the institution is financially sound. Thereafter, the earniags poten-
tial is attractive.
Recommendations
6.04      A second loan of US$4.2 million is recommended to meet approximately
two thirds of SOFISEDIT's needs in foreign exchange for financing of enter-
prises in industry and tourism, and provide $200,000 for assistance to SONEPI
to develop an integrated scheme for assisting small-scale Senegalese entre-
preneurs. The loan would finance the CIF cost of imported goods, the foreign
costs of services and the foreign component of civil works. The foreign
exchange risk, on Bank funds would be borne by the Government. The free limit
would be raised from $100,000 to $250,000 in recognition of the progress made
in SOFISEDIT's appraisal capabilities. The aggregate free limit would be
increased from $600,000 to $1.5 million.



- 26 -
6.05      During negotiations, agreement was reached and assurances were
obtained on the following main points:
(i) the foreign exchange risk to be borne by the Govern-
ment on all sub-loans and iinvestments made by SOFISEDIT
(para. 5.15);
(ii)  SOFISEDIT efforts to find alternative sources of foreign
exchange (para. 5.12);
(iii) the need and the timing of a major increase in SOFISEDIT's
paid-up share capital (para. 5.17).
(iv)  the Government will bear the foreign exchange risks and
the total financial charges relating to the US$200,000 to
be used by SONEPI (para. 2.60).

ANNEX 4
Page 1
SOFISEDIT
STATEMENT OF GENERAL POLICY
1.   OBJECTIVES AND OPERATIONAL CRITERIA
1.        The company will assist in the development of soundly managed
enterprises in Senegal in all the productive sectors of the economy, includ-
ing tourism, mining, agro-industries, services and engineering. The company
will not, however, engage in financing projects concerned exclusively with
agriculture production or housing.
2.        The company will extend its assistance on the basis of economic
and financial criteria only. Enterprises that submit projects to the
company shall be required to have efficient management, be technically
sound, have satisfactory market prospects for their production, be able
to generate an adequate financial return on the investment and generally
to contribute to the economic growth of the country in accordance with the
objectives of the Governments Development Plan.
3.        The company will extend all kinds of assistance, financial and
other. The company will invest in the capital of enterprises and will
subscribe to issues of shares and other securities; it will endeavor to
assist in broadening the ownership bases of industry in Senegal by assisting
in public share issues. It will grant medium- and long-term loans, for
periods depending on the type of project involved, with an appropriate
grace period. The company may also furnish guarantees. It will not engage
in refinancing operations.
II. INVESTMENT POLICY
4.        The company's assistance in the form of loans or participations
or both forms combined may not normally amount to less than CFAF 2 million.
5.        The total amount of loans granted by the company together with
its participations and any other commitments of a financial nature in
favor of a single enterprise will not normally exceed 20% of the company's
paid-up share capital and reserves.
6.        The company's total investments in the form of equity participa-
tions may not exceed 75% of the company's share of capital and reserves.
7.        As a general rule the company will limit its equity participation
in any one enterprise to a maximum of 15% of its own share capital and
reserves.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
8.        Generally, the company will not assume managerial responsibilities
in enterprises it assists and will limit its share participations to 25%
of the share capital of any given enterprise. It may, however, by unanimous
decision of the Board, 'exceed this percentage and even assume managerial
responsibility if this is justified by the circumstances or the nature of
the enterprise.
9.        When deciding upon the amount and form of financial assistance
it will provide, the company will take into account all the financial
requirements of the project and the financial situation of the enterprise
in question. In principle, the company will not finance more than 50%
of the total cost of the project. It may, however, exceed this limit
if there is special justification, such as in the case of an expansion
project.
10.       The company will endeavor to maintain a balanced portfolio by
distributing its loans, participations and other commitments geographically
and amongst all the sectors of industrial and economic activity within
the range of its objectives.
III. FINANCIAL POLICY
11.       The general aim of the company's financial policy is to maintain
the value of its own capital, to manage its funds in such a way that it is
at all times able to meet its obligations and to achieve earnings that
enables it to form adequate reserves and distribute reasonable dividends
to its shareholders. To this end the company will:
-    maintain a satisfactory balance between the maturities of its
own obligations and those of the loans it grants;
-    not incur debt having an original maturity of more than one year,
in excess of the limits imposed by the Banking regulations;
-    take adequate steps to protect itself from exchange risks in
respect of those of its borrowings that are repayable in foreign
currencies;
-    require appropriate security for the loans and guarantees it
grants;
-    fix its interest rates, commissions and other charges at a level
that reflects the cost of capital in Senegal and that will enable
it to obtain a satisfactory return;
-    make adequate provisions against potential losses and build up
reserves to a level consistent with sound financial practices,
taking into account the size and quality of its portfolio of
loans and investments as well as the need to pay adequate
dividends to its shareholders.
