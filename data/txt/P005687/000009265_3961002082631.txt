MUNICIPAL SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borromrs                Republic of Tunisia
Amount:                  uSS';5 million equivalent
Terms&                   Repayable in 17 years, including a five-year grace period,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate
Descriptions            The project aims at increasing the efficiency of the local
authorities in decision making- resource mobilization and
allocation, and project fin&       and implementation; it
will include the following:
(a)   Institutional strengthening for the municipalities and the
Ministries of Int-rior and Finance (US$6.7 million - 3
percent of total project cost). Consultants, services,
vehicles,   and  equipment  would  help  develop  the
municipalities' managerial, financial, technical, and
staff training capabilities. This component includes two
main elements: (i) establishment of a training directorate
within MOl to manage a training program for the
Municipalities and the Regional Councils, and delivery of
training; and (ii) studies bolstering the local tax reform
and the improvement of municipal management.
(b)   Iastitutional strengthening for the Municipal Development
Agency (MDA) (US$1.0 million - 1 percent of total project
cost) (guipment, vehicles, and consultants' services).
This will help restructure and strengthen MDA so that it
can play a major role in the evaluation of both the
projects and the municipalities it will finance.
(c)   Priority infrastructure investments for municipalities and
regional councils (US$200 million - 96 percent of total
project cost). These include: (i) upgrading of low-income
neighborhoods;   (i$)  construction,   maintenance,   and
rehabilitation of municipal infrastructure in existing
neighborhoods including urban roads, street lighting,
drainage, and solid waste collection and disposal systems;
and (i$i) construction and equipment of commercial



- il -
facilities such as markets.   These projects will be
appraised by MDA according to eligibility criteria agreed
with the Bank.
Beneits:                 Economic benefits would mainly materialize in the form of
increased land values in subproject areas. The provision
of solid waste disposal facilities, marketplaces, and
slaughterhouses together with sanitary precautions and
sound waste disposal schemes would help reduce the
negative health and snvironmental impact of existing
haphazard   food   processing   and   waste   management
arrangements. Street maintenance subprojects would yield
savings in vehicle operating costs, while helping reduce
congestion-related air contamination.    The paving or
repair of urban streets would help reduce the production
of dust particles by vehicular traffic on unpaved or
broken road surfaces, with beneficial effects on air
quality and health.   Improving the coverage of basic
services would primarily benefit low-income areas.
Indirect benefits would accrue from the execution of more
cost-effective projectu, the improvement of management
capabilities at local level, the application of more
transparent service pricing, improved institutional
arrangements, and human resources development.
Risks and safeauards:   Improving  local  services  and  municipal  management
nationwide is an ambitious undertaking and will require a
sustained effort in the years ahead.   The project is
complex, and its implementation involves a large number of
agencies, many of which are institutionally weak. Risks
include the possibility of: (i) inadequate project
preparation capacity at the local level, resulting in slow
implementation or low quality of subprojects; and (ii)
political   pressures    undermining    conditionalities
introduced in MDA lending. The project would also face
some financial risks as the reforms necessary to increase
the resources of the municipalities may suffer delays.
The project includes measures to address these risks. The
proposed annual review of project implementation would
lead to timely plans of action to remedy identified
shortcomings.     Key  project  instiFlitions  would  be
strengthened as part of the project and are committed to
achieve targets that can be monitored.

REPUBLIC OF TUINISIA
MUNICIPAL SECTOR INVESTMENT PROECT  MSIP
I.  SECTOR BACKOROUND
The proposed loan would finance a Municipal Sector Investment Project
(MEIP) that aims at increasing the efficiency of lonal governments (municipaAities
and regional councils) in planning and delivering local services, financing and
implementing investments as well as mobilizing a.d allocating resources.  This
project is part of the Government of Tunisia's (GOT) macroeconomic and
institutional rp*orm Lgograms, which the Bank has been supporting through
adjustment lending and a Public Enterprise Reform Loan. The MSIP will support GOT
in increasing the efficiency of public sector investment by strengthening local
gov.rnments and financing part of their investments, and thereby increasing their
contribution to the economic, social and political development of the country.
A.   Urban Growth, and Demand for Services
1.01        Tunisia is a highly urbanized country with about 60 percent of its
eight million population living in urban areas. More than 80 percent of its GDP
originates in the Tunis Metropolitan Area and three other cities along the coast
(Sfax, Sousse, and Bizerte). The urban growth rate is about 3.7 percent, while
population growth rate is 2.2 percent.  It is projected that by the year 2000,
about 7 million people will live in Tunisian cities, creating further demands on
their ability to provide infrastructure and services.

B.   Institutional Framework
1.02        The municipal  structure  is more than a century old  (the Tunis
municipality was created in 1858)1 its rules and regulations were updated in 1975,
in 1985, and more recently in 1991. For geographical and historical reasons (among
others its heritage from the French colonization), Tunisia began its independence
in 1956 with a highly centralized and powerful national administration and very
weak local and regional governmental units.
1.03        The structure of GOT consists of three tic s: the Central Government
and its ministrtes and agencies, the regional governorates, and the local
governments rep !sented by the municipalities. Large municipalities have created
smaller bodies called districts (arrondiosements)i associations of municipalities
(syndicate de communes) were planned by law but are practically nonexistent.
1.04        The institutional framework of the Tunisian municipal system is
controlled by GOT through the Ministry of Interior (OI). MOI has supervioory
authority for all local governments and exercises its authority at the regional
level through the governorates, which are themselves divided into delegations.
C.   Municipal Ressonsibilities
1.05        The 246 municipalities vary greatly in size and population.  Central
Tunis, the largest city, has a population of 600,000 inhabitants, and the smallest
municipality has fewer than a thousand. Half of the municipalities have fewer than
10,000 inhabitants.  The municipal territories do not cover the whole country.
Only urban and semi-urban areas have municipalities.   An effort to widen the
coverage of municipalities to the whole country has only recently begun.

1.06        Tunisian  municipalities  are  weak  governmental  structures.    A
considerable gap persists between the role assigned to them by law and the one they
are able to perform. Consequently, the economic importance of local governments
remains weak.
1.07        Municipalities have two kinds of responsibilities: the development of
the municipal community and the management of municipal affairs. Development of
the municipal community is achieved through local-level implementation of the
national development plans and the definition of a five-year Municipal Investment
Program (PIC). Management of municipal affairs covers four types of activities:
- collection of funds and protection of property
- protection of public health and order (that includes maintenance of
roads, public spaces and buildings, household garbage collection)
- management of municipal territory (including road system alignment,
zoning, sanitation plan)
- manr.gement of civil registry.
Municivalities and National Agengies
1.08          Details of the institutional framework are provided in Annex 1. The
Government has recently begun a process to strengthen its local governments'
decision-making procedures.   Many urban services are now being carried out by
central government agencies; their population coverage and cost recovery are
adequate and the highest in the Maghreb countries. Because the country's size does
not justify the creation of public utilities in every municipality and in view of
the local governments' institutional weaknesses, GOT does not intend to devolve
these responsibilities to lower levels of government. These central government
agencies include the National Water Production and Distribution Company (SONEDE)
for drinking water, the National Sanitation Office (ONAS) for sewer and storm
drainage, the Urban Rehabilitation and Renewal Agency (ARRU) for neighborhood
upgrading, and the Ministry of Equipment and Housing (MEH) for main road building
and maintenance.    GOT's  intention  is to strengthen the capacity of  local
governments to (a) plan and manage their own investment programs; (b) coordinate
central agencies' activities in their jurisdiction; and (c) improve the few
services they do perform (minor road and sewer works, refuse co'lection and
disposal, street lighting and some community facilities).

1.09        From 1975 to 1990 the provision of basic urban services has evolved as
represented in Figure 3.

Municival Structure (See details in Annex 2)
1.10        The municipal authority is vested in the council (elected), and its
president, the maXor, supervises and coordinates the council's work and
countersigns and ensures implementation of its decisions.  Because most mayors
serve voluntarily and cannot devote their full time to their post, they must
delegate their authority to other council members.
1.11        The Secretary' General of the municipality has an administrative role.
As an official of the Central Government, i.e., MOI, remunerated from the budget,
he plays the role of legal advisor to the council and is responsible, under the
authority of the chairman, for nanaging municipal personnel, the municipal road
system, ar-d overseeing the col-. _tion of local taxes and fees.
1.12        The responsibilities of the Municipal Council are to prepare and
approve the budget and supervise municipalities' affairs.
1.13        The  regional  authorities  consists  of  23  aovernorates.           The
administrative authority is represented by the Governor, who is appointed by the
President of the Republic and is under the supervision of MOI. The Governorate
Councils are endowed with legal and financial status. More recently the Central



Government decided to give the Governorate Councils more financial autonomy and a
more important role in the economic development of the region. To that end, it
decided to assign the regional development program to the governorates.   In
addition, GOT started implementing a general policy of decentralization and
requested public enterprises to decentralize their operations and decision-making
processes. This is already quite advanced for public enterprises such as ONAS and
SONEDE.
Municioal Staff (See details in Annex 4)
1.14        There are about 18,000 municipal employees in Tunisia, corresponding
to 4 civil servants per 1,000 inhabitants. This is a low figure by international
standards (some countries, like France for example, have as many as 18 civil
servants per 1,000 inhabitants). Despite &"he growing share of municipal receipts
devoted to salaries (on average 50 percent), the municipalities continue to face
inadequate staffing in numbtr and quality as they employ unskilled staff and
recruit few specialists as indicated in FiLj"-a 4 below.

1988 data
1.15        The inadequacies of municipal personnel can be explained partly by the
restrictive control exercised by the MOI over all recruitment of skilled staff and
partly by the unattractiveness of municipal positions to civil servants. Although
municipal staff are governed by the same regulations as central government civil
servants, municipal positions do not offer commensurate benefits or promotion
possibilities.  Moreover, the institutional weaknesses of municipalities as a
whole, the lack of clear definition of their powers and responsibilities, and the
resultant poor intra-municipal relations make these posts less attractive. The
solution app-ied so far by the Central Government, in the specific case of the post



- 6 -
of Secretary-General, has been to endow the position with more decision-making
authority, greater autonomy vis-&-vis the Municipal Council, and a more direct
relationship with the supervisory authority. Improving municipalities' managerial
capacities depends chiefly on improving the qualifications of their personnel. It
is therefore essential that action ha taken to create the necessary conditions for
recruiting better qualified personnel and to provide basic and refresher training
for the existing staff. The preaent project will address these issues.
D.   Municinal finance
1.16        Municipal  finance  is administered under  the  strict  supervision
("tutelage") of the Ministries of Interior and Finance. Smaller municipalities
(i.e., those with annual budget under TD 350,000) are supervised by the governor.
(See Annex 3 for details).
1.17        The current role of the municipalities in the country's economic
development is almost negligible.  The total budget of Tunisian municipalities
represented only 1.3 percent of 1988's GDP, and their resources reached barely 5
percent of GOT's revenues. The annual average level of investments controlled by
municipalities is about US$12 per capita, mostly self-financed. Twenty-two percent
of municipal revenues are constituted by local tax receipts, as shown in Figure 5
below.

1. 8         GOT finances almost half of municipalities' budgets through several
channels. In 1988, 47 percent of their total operating budgets were financed with
transfers via the Local Government Common Fund (FCCL), and 40 percent of their
investments through the budgets of various ministries. The Municipal Development
Agency (MDA), an agency under the supervision of MOI, provides additional
investment financing in the form of loans and grants for local governmedts but has
until now operated as a cashier's window for the General Directorate for Local
Governments (DGCPL) of the Ministry of Interior (MOI). Under the project, the MDA
will be restructured and strengthened.  Figure 6 shows the Central Government
transfer figures for 1985-91.

1.19         In the past ten years, several reforms have taken place to define the
role and composition of FCCL. GOT has asked the Director General of Taxation to
present new local tax reform proposals (See calendar in Annex 3). The project
would therefore assist in the implementation of these changes. More recently, GOT
has approved an increase, by as much as 100 percent, in the tariffs for municipal
services such as civil registry (Etat Civil), use of public space, and building
permits.    Drastic  reforms,  however,  are  constrained  by,  among  others,
inefficiencies in Tunisia's tax collection (evasion rates are high, particularly
for direct taxation), cumbersome land registration procedures, and political
considerations.
1.20         The project would support efforts leading to increasing fiscal revenue,
increasing local revenue predictability and introducing revised mechanisms for
establishing the amounts to be transferred through FCCL and new criteria for the
allocation of those funds.



-8-
1.21        These elements have been studied and discussed with the Bank in the
context of the "Municipal Finance and Management in Tunisia" sector study and the
project feasibility study.  There is now a consensus on the need to follow the
recent broad reform of taxation (VAT, direct taxes, fees, and stamp duties) with
a reform of local taxes (See Annex 3 for details). During negotiations, agreement
was reached that GOT would carry out a reform program to improve municipal finance.
The program's objectives are to:
(a)   simplify the local tax regime through simplifying (i) the structure and
scope of coverage of real property taxes and (ii) business taxes,
indirect taxes and user charges, including, inter alia, unification of
each of these taxes by sector of activity;
(b)   expand the scope of coverage of real property taxes and business taxes;
(c)   reduce the rates of real property taxes, business taxes and indirect
taxes and user charges; and
(d)   increase revenues through improved tax collection.
The Government has established a "local tax reform commission" which will present
by December 31, 1992, a report outlining the principal policies and actions to be
pursued. On the basis of the above-mentioned report, GOT would present to the
Bank, no later than March 31, 1993, an action plan to be discussed and to be
carried out thereafter. The program would also include completing by June 30,
1995, the cost recovery study to be carried out under the project and ensuring
adequate transfers of budgetary funds to MDA through FCCL (an 8.5 percent annual
increase for the years 1992-1996 has been decided by GOT) and directly from GOT
(para. 3.01).
E.   Prospect for Reforms - The Municipal Develooment Program (MDP)
1.22        Despite its relatively small size, Tunisia has a tradition of political
deconcentration and decentralization. Decentralization, broadly meaning increasing
the responsibilities and resources of subnational political and administrative
units, has been regarded as an officially desirable goal for Tunisia for the past
quarter century. The rhetoric on decentralization, however, long exceeded action,
for a variety of reasons--notably the centralist French heritage, the need to
consolidate national unity after independence, the interventionist economic
policies pursued in the 1960s, and the then-prevailing intellectual climate of
development opinion which saw state intervention and comprehensive planning as the
key elements of a successful strategy.   This situation began to change in the
1970s. The main Law on Municipalities (Loi Organique des Communes), which defines
the local government structure in Tunisia, was modified in 1975 and 1985. Since
1985, when the Local Government Code was amended and a general policy of
strengthening   local   government   articulated,   little   real   progress   in
decentralization occurred until 1989.  At that time, the creation of Regional
Councils and the delegation of authority to Governors demonstrated the National
Government's serious commitment to decentralize and deconcentrate decision-making
by, among others, giving real authority to Government representatives, such as the
Governor, and expanding the responsibilities of local governments.



-9-
1.23        Although  only  modest  progress  has  been  made  to  date  toward
decentralization of urban services, the process is now moving forwards a cabinet-
level position of State Secretury for Local Governments was created in 1989 within
the Ministry of Interior (MOI). More significantly, GOT has made regional and
municipal development the foundation of its Eighth National Economic Plan (1992-
96).
1.24        MOI had already started the preparation of a municipal investment
program (PIC) for the Seventh Economic Plan (1987-91) and has maintained this
format for the preparation of its Eighth Plan (1992-96).  The PIC is a list of
investment projects for all municipalities, including financing plans for the plan
period. This is already a major improvement over the previous ad hoc investment
process. Nevertheless, the PIC excluded important elements such as a cost-recovery
mechanism, financial and economic analyses, and maintenance obligations, which the
strengthening of MDA should help bring into this process.
1.25        It is generally accepted that the municipalities are underequipped to
perform many of the functions within their purview, and that efficiency gains can
be realized through planning, financing, and implementation of local activities
closer to the end users. Since the early 1980s, GOT has increasingly sought to
address constraints faced by local governments in performing their development
role. This led to the preparation of a Municipal Development Program (MDP), aimed
at identifying and removing constraints to local development in order to increase
overall efficiency in the Tunisian economy. The MDP is being developed along the
lines of the Bank's "Municipal Finance and Management in Tunisia" sector work of
1987, which led to the feasibility study for the preparation of the project. It
is designed to equip local governments with adequate human, financial,
institutional, and administrative resources to enable them to perform their
economic and political role.
1.26        The MDP irncludes the following actions:
(a)   expansion of the role played by municipalities, together with studies
intended to clarify the responsibilities of the different levels of
public administration (ministries and their national agencies,
municipalities, and governorates) engaged in the planning and
implementation of local services and activities;
(b)   local  finance  reform  (para.  1.21)  to:  (i)  establish  financing
mechanisms that make the volume of resources available to local
authorities easier to predict and, as a result, allow municipalities
to improve the quality of their financial planning; and (ii) expand the
volume of funds available to local governments by increasing transfers
from the Government budget and mobilizing additional local resources.
The Government has decided to increase FCCL to TD 96 million for the
1992 budget from TD 87 million in 1991 and to maintain its annual
growth by about 8.5 percent, reaching about 5 percent of Government
fiscal revenues by the end of the Eighth Plan in 1996;
(c)   establishment  of  efficient  decision-making mechanisms  for  local
investment by introducing appropriate planning, implementation, and



- 10 -
financing procedures that would ensure that local interests are
adequately covered in respect of national priorities, and by endowing
MDA with the capacity to oversee and implement objective criteria for
the provision of credit to finance municipal investments;
(d)   provision of adequate management tools to the municipalities, such as
better local statistics, operating manuals, and computerization; and
(e)   strengthening local governments' human resources, by increasing the
number of local higher-level civil servants, redefining their status,
identifying required training, implementing a system to meet those
needs, and setting up a training directorate within MOI.
The project will support most elements of the MDP through studies and
technical assistance (see para. 2.09 and Annexes 4, 5 and 9).
F.   The Municipal Develooment Acencv
1.27        The Caisse des Pr&ts et de Soutien aux Collectivit6s Locales, or
Municipal Development Agency (MDA), was created by Law 75-37 of May 14, 1975, as
a legally autonomous administrative agency in charge of the distribution of
Government funds to local governments. MDA receives most of its funds from FCCL,
and has been lending to the municipalities for (a) the acquisition of goods (5
years at 4 percent interest), (b) revenue-generating investments (10 years at 4
percent interest), and (c) non-revenue-producing local infrastructure (20 years at
2 percent interest).   Until its recent restructuring, MDA was in practice a
cashier's window; all its decisions were in fact made by the General Directorate
for Public Local Governments (DGCPL, a department of MO0) which is, at the same
time, the supervisory body in charge of MDA.
1.28        Since its origin, MDA had not worked properly because it was never
properly staffed and structured. This has resulted in the general abandonment of
MDA, to the point that the Board has not held a session for the past several years
and MDA's staff has remained at three. It has lacked a proper accounting system
and has had difficulties in preparing loan amortization tables in a timely manner.
Loan recovery has also been slow. According to Decree 92-688 of April 16, 1992,
MDA is now administered by a Board presided over by the Minister of Interior and
is composed of representatives of MOI, MOF, MEH, the National Federation of Cities,
and the Central Bank of Tunisia. The Board approves the program of activities, its
annual budget, and its financial statements. The General Director carries out the
decisions made by the Board, and generally ensures MDA's administrative, financial,
and technical manaqement.
1.29        one of the main objectives of the project is to strengthen MDA in its
new role of assisting the municipalities in developing their project preparation
and implementation capabilities and their ability to fund their investments.
Importantly, MDA would bring discipline to the sector while assisting
municipalities in developing information and financial management systems. MDA
would continue to be a parastatal agency with administrative autonomy. In addition
to the General Manager, there will be five managers and a dozen professional staff



- 11 -
member.s.   Details of the organization of MDA are given in Annex 5. During
negotiations, agreemont was reached that MDA would:
(a)   be adequately staffed, according to a recruitment plan agreed with the
Bank, with professionals competent in project appraisal and,
particularly, with a General Manager (see Annexes 5 and 6 for details);
(b)   carry out a training program agreed upon with the Bank and provide
during the period of project implementation a rolling annual staff
training program;
(c)   implement by June 30, 1993, as part of the project,  an adequate
accounting system; and
(d)   qperate according to its Operation Manual,  to be adopted before
effectiveness (see para. 3.05), especially in regard to the management
of subloans and matching grants and the subloan approval procedures.
1.30        As a condition of effectiveness, MDA is management team (five managers)
would be recruited and in place and the Operation Manual would be adopted.
XI. THE PROJECT
A.   Prior Bank ExRerience with Urban Infrastructure in Tunisia
2.01        Until now the Bank has granted five urban development loans to Tunisia.
The first project (Loan 937/Credit 432-TUN, US$18 million, 1973) was a successful
urban planning and urban transport project, including the rehabilitation of a
suburban railway line in Tunis and the setting up of the Tunis District, a Greater
Tunis planning agency. The second project (Loan 1705-TUN, US$19 million, 1979) was
directed to two municipalities, Tunis and Sfax. The third and fourth projects
(Loan 2223-TUN, US$25 million, 1983 and Loan 2736-TUN, US$30.2 million, 1986)
initiated the institutional strengthening of ARRU and the Housing Land Agency
(APH). The fifth project (Loan 3064-TUN, US$58 million, 1989) includes a line of
credit to a restructured housing bank, institutional strengthening of the Ministry
of Equipment and Housing (MEH), and a land registration component.
2.02        The Bank has also financed seven water supply projects, three sewerage
projects, one flood protection project, and five transportation projects, all of
which have contributed measurably to Tunisian cities' infrastructure network.
2.03        The activities financed by the Bank in Tunisian cities have gradually
evolved into operations with broader objectives.   From the financing of site-
specific urban works, a transition has been made into assisting GOT in improving
urban policies that affect other economic sectors and institutions responsible for
their implementation. The fifth urban development project (FY89), which addresses
housing finance policy and institutional constraints, is a good example.



- 12 -
Supporting GOT's current decentralization efforts and improving the efficiency of
municipal activities, especially in regard to the environment, as intended by this
project, would add to the evolution of the Bank's role in the urban sector.
2.04        In the urban sector, project work has been supported by extensive
sector work, namely the "Housing Sector Review" (1983), the Institutional Housing
Sector Review (1984), and a financial model for the housing sector (1987).  In
1988, the "Municipal Finance and Management in Tunisia" sector study was completed.
Finally, an informal Housing Sector Review and a Land Recistration Note played an
important role in the design of the housing policy endorsed by GOT in July 1988,
and in the recent changes in the land registration system, which should lead to the
oreparation of a new project in this sector.
3.   Proiect Oriain and Rationale for Bank Involvement
Proiect Origin
2.05        As mentioned above,  the Bank has had extensive experience with
municipal aspects of infrastructure projects. But more directly, the project draws
on the experience in municipal development and finance in similar projects in other
countries, while building on the sector work resulting in the report Municipal
Finances and Management in Tunisia, March 2, 1988 (7150-TUN). This dialogue led
to the formulation of the project now proposed to support the Government's MDP.
A feasibility study, Proiet de d6velopoement municipal, financed under the Second
Urban Transport Project, was started in April 1989. The final report was issued
at the time of appraisal in November 1991. Formal project preparation was delayed
for 14 months due to the nomination of two State Secretaries for Municipalities,
organization of municipal elections, and a thorough review of the interim report
of the feasibility study, which was subsequently endorsed by two interministerial
committees. The Bank helped to prepare terms of reference for that study.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.06          The Bank's support to GOT's urban sector activities has gradually
moved beyond financing infrastructure investments to supporting changes in sector
policies, to assisting in the implementation of fundamental changes in the public
sector's institutional responsibilities. The project would support implementation
of GOT's MDP, which intends to strengthen the local governments and increase their
contribution to the economic, social, and political development of the country.
This would result in making elected local governments more responsible to their
constituencies, and at the same time provide these local authorities with the means
to respond to their mandates, i.e., financing investments, enhancing their local
revenue-raising ability and strengthening their institutional capacity to deliver
iservices efficiently. Success in this endeavor will determine the viability of
GOT's Eighth Plan's reliance on regional and municipal development as well as
strengthen Bank's contribution to the Tunisian urban sector.
2.07        The Eighth Plan rests on regional and municipal development as the
backbone of its development strategy. The Plan contemplates about US$460 million
to finance the PIC. The project would finance priority investments in the PIC
which have a high social, environmental, and private sector management content.



- 13 -
Bank participation in the project would complement the financing resources of the
central and local government budgets for these investments. The municipalities'
own revenues would be increased through a revamped local tax regime, and MDA would
improve its financial viability by managing GOT's grants, building its equity
through loan recovery and moving towards efficiency pricing in public investment
financing.  Investment quality would increase, as projects would be financed on
technical, financial, institutional and economic criteria. Matching grants for
investments would be allocated according to national priorities (e.g., the
environment).
C.   Obiectives and Description
Prolect Obiectives
2.08        The general objective of the project is to help GOT increase the
efficiency of municipalities and regional councils in decision making, resource
mobilization and allocation, and project financing and implementation.  As the
first Bank operation directly supporting local governments, the project would focus
ont (a) increasing the local authorities' ability to carry out their
responsibilities in planning, identification, and follow-up of municipal
investments; (b) strengthening MDA; and (c) improving the municipalities' provision
of basic infrastructure and services through the financing of investments,
including solid waste management and urban upgrading in existing low-income
neighborhoods.
Proiect Descriltion
2.09        The project would include the following components:
(a)   Institutional  strengthening  for the municipalities  and  for the
Ministries of Interior and of Finance (US$6.7 million, 3 percent of the
total project cost);
(b)   Institutional strengthening for MDA: this will help strengthen Z4DA as
the primary technical and institutional agent of the Government for
municipal finance and development (US$1.0 million, about 1 percent of
the total project cost); and
(c)   Priority infrastructure investments for municipalities and regional
councils (US$200 million, 96 percent of the total project cost).
Details are given in the paragraphs below and in Annexes 4, 7, 8,
and 9.
2.10        Institutional Strenathenine for Municinalitios and Ministries:  This
component includes consultants' services, vehicles and equipment for the
municipalities and for the Ministries of Interior and of Finance. This would help
develop their managerial, financial, technical, and staff training capabilities.
This component includes two main elements:



- 14 -
(a)   a training program  for the staff of municipalities and regional
councils, which includes the setting up of a Training Directorate
within MOI and the financing for training sessions. As of the startup
of the project, the Training Directorate would be established as a link
between  municipalities  and  training  entities.    This  Training
Directorate will call upon existing training entities such as Ecole
Nationale d'Administration (ENA), Ecole Nationale d'Ingenieurs de
Tunisie (ENIT), and Office de Formation Professionnelle et de l'EmploL
(OFPE), to provide training. The Training Directorate will have the
authority to assess their results, to modify the contents of their
actions, and to require special activities from them. It will work
jointly with the Project Coordinator to define the training program and
budget which will be presented to the Bank.   External technical
assistance would be provided for the establishment and startup of the
Training Directorate; MOI has recently started discussions with the
French Ministry of Interior on this matter.
(b)   consultants, services  bolstering  the  local  tax  reform  and  the
improvement of municipal management. These studies would be managed
by DGCPL and the Project Coordinator in consultation with the
administrative serviceu  concerned.   The terms of reference of the
studies to be carried out in a certain year would be agreed with the
Bank by December 31, of the previous year. See details in Annexes 4
and 9.
2.11        Stronethenina of RDA.   This component will help restructure and
strengthen MDA with a major role in the evaluation of both the projects and the
municipalities it will finance. It will include among others:
- the setting up of an accounting system by June 30, 1993;
- the adoption of procedures for project appraisal and follow-up
(Operation Manual);
- the hiring of MDA staff including a manager experienced in financial
matters and project appraisal;
- staff training; and
- provision of equipment and vehicles.
Details of MDA's organization, staffing, appraisal procedures and policy statement
are given in Annex 5. Subproject eligibility criteria are given in Annex 7.
2.12        Municipal Investments.  These would include: (a) upgrading of low-
income neighborhoods; (b) construction, maintenance, and rehabilitation of
municipal infrastructure in existing neighborhoods including urban roads, street
lighting, drainage, solid waste collection and disposal systems; and (c)
construction and equipment of commercial facilities such as markets and
slaughterhouses.  These projects would be appraised according to eligibility
criteria acceptable to the Bank (see para. 3.04 and Annex 7). These priorities
are reflected in the allocation of loans and matching grants which would be
decided annually by the Government according to sectorial priorities (See details
in para. 3.02, Fiqure 11 and in Annex 8).

D.  Pgolect cost and financina
Cost
2.13        Municipal investments for the Eighth Plan (92-96) amount to about
US$460 million of which the project would finance about 44 percent as shown in
Figure 7. The total cost of the project is estimated to be US$208 million, of
which 96 percent would be for the infrastructure investments, am shown in Figure
8 below. The proposed loan of US$75 million would finance about 36 percent of
total project cost, approximately equivalent to the foreign exchange component.
Cost estimates include provisions for taxes estimated to amount to about US$37
million (18 percent).   The project includes municipal investments with high
social and environmental aspects and excludes investments like administrative,
cultural, and sporta buildings included in the PIC but financed with
contributions of the ministries of Interior, Culture and Youth.

local governments; (ii) 33 percent by a loan obtained from MDA; and (iii) 40
percent from matching grants from the Central Government. These percentages will
vary by sector to reflect GOT priorities (see para 3.02 and details in Annex 8).
E. Flinancial Impact
2.17        An important axis of the project rests with MDA, which would be
called to assist the municipalities in developing their investment and financing
capacities. MDA would be the primary vehicle for financing municipal investments
and, more important, the instrument for developing the municipalities so as to
enable them to fund themselves with less recourse to Government funds. The Bank
loan would be made to GOT, which would transfer part of the proceeds to ZDA and
to MOI and MOF for the institutional development components on a grant basis.
GOT will onlend the funds to MDA for municipal investments.   The financial
viability of the municipalities and MDA are, therefore, critical to the success
of the Government's efforts to introduce financial discipline in the sector.
Municipalities
2.18        The financial impact of the Government's MDP (para. 1.26), which the
project supports, can be seen in Annex 6, which shows the financial outlook of
the entire municipal sector to the year 2000 (pages 1 to 3). The reforms to be
undertaken under the project (see para. 1.21) are projected to increase annual
municipal current revenues from their current level of about TD 125 million to
some TD 250 million by 2000.   These enhanced revenues would allow the
municipalities to increase their net internally generated funds from about TD 15
million in 1990 to more than TD 20 million by 2000.  Government direct and
indirect contributions to investments would rise from about TD 20 million in 1991
to about TD 45 million by 2000, while borrowings would increase from about TD 15
million to about TD 30 million, by 2000, to finance investments of about TD 100
million. The self-financing ratio2 of the sector would evolve from 14 percent
in 19933 to 22 percent in 2000, by which time the municipalities would have a
healthy debt-service coverage ratio4 of 1.6. To ensure the financial viability
of the municipalities, durina necotiations agreement was reached to have those
municipalities borrowing from MDA under this  :oject maintain at all times a
debt-service coverage ratio of at least 1.3 (para. 3.04).
Municipal Development Aaencv
2.19        The financial impact of the project on MDA is described in Annex 6
(pages 4 to 9).   MDA's funds would come from: (a) the loan charges to
municipalities and their recovery (including those previously made by MDA, which
were fully funded by the Government), net of debt service payments and operating
V    The municipalities' self-financing ratio is the contribution from the current budget net internally
generated funds to the investment budget.
V     The 1992 ratios are exceptional because the President forgave the debts owed by the municipalities
for 1992.
The municipalitiesf debt-service coverage ratio is the ratio of current revenues (net of current
expenses, excluding interest expense) to debt service (principal and interest).

expenses; theue funds would finance on average about 40 percent of loan. made in
1993-2000; (b) FCCL allocations plus net Government transfers (about 6 percent
of 1993-2000 loans); and (c) borrowings (58 percent of 1993-2000 loans). MDA's
annual lending program has been estimated on the basis of the PIC (para. 1.24).
The loan amounts for the first few years of MDAs operations would be a mixture
of old loans committed before its restructuring plus new loans prepared and
approved since 1992. The interest rate of MDA loans would be increased with this
project from the previous 2 percent to 6.5 percent in 1992, for all the loans
made to municipalities, (except for sanitation, vehicles and equipment fLn&nced
under a suppliers credit), and to 8.5 percent from January 1st, 1997; these rates
would be posltlve in real terms based on forecasts of lnflatlon of 5 percent for
fthe 1992-1996 perlod. An understandlng has been reached that the Bank would
revlew MDA's interest rates with the Government if the inflation rate differs
substantially from the forecast. MDA's net income as a percent of average equity
would rise from about 1.6 percent in 1993 to about 4.0 percent by 2000, while net
income as a percent of average total assets would increase from about 1.2 percent
ln 1993 to about 2.1 percent by 2000. These increases in net income would be due
to the replacement of the old loans by the new loans. MDA's financing pattern
would allow it to maintain a very conservatlve leverage wlth its debt-equity
ratio oscillating between 30 percent (1993) and 52 percent (1996). MDA's debt-
service coverage ratio5 including loan recovery would at all times remain above
a healthy 1.5. The average over the period would be 2.1. A more stringent test
of debt-service coverage excluding loan recovery shows a ratio between 0.6 and
2.0, which is also acceptable. To ensure the financial viability of MDA and the
protection of its equity base, during necotiations agreement was reached that MDA
would:
(i)   maintain at all times a debt-service coverage ratio including loan
recovery of at least 1.5;
(ii)  attain every year a self-financing ratio6 of no less than 20 percent
in 1993, 30 percent in 1994, 35 percent in 1995-98, and 40 percent
from 1999 (between 20 and 30 percent in the past);
(iii) achieve margins between the annual revenue on average total assets
and the annual expenses on average total assets of at least 1
percent from 1993 to 1998 and 1.5 percent thereafter; and
(iv)  charge on its infrastructure loans an interest rate of 6.5 percent
during 1992-1996, and of 8.5 percent starting January 1, 1997. On
equipment loans financed from suppliers' credits, MDA would charge
interest at, at least, 4 percent during 1992-1996 and 6 percent
thereafter.
I/   NDA's debt-service coverage ratio is the ratio of IDA's revenues (including loan recovery) net of
cash operating expenses to debt service (capitalt interest, and comitment fees).
SDA's self-financing ratio is the ratio of its anuat net internal cash generation (revenues net of
cash operating expenses, less working capitel needs and debt service, plus loan recovery) to anmaL
loans to municipalities.

F.   Cost Recovery
2.20        Under the project, the totality of Bank loan proceeds and GOT's
counterpart funds, which will be onlent as subloans via MDA, will be fully
recovered from the municipalities. These would in turn recover costs from end-
users and other beneficiaries. The overall policy for cost recovery criteria
would be included in the Operation Manual for MDA (see para. 1.29 and 3.05).
Revenue-earning facilities (e.g., markets, slaughterhouses) would be directly
subject to cost recovery through recourse to market value rents, user charges,
and fees.   The MSIP feasibility study has analyzed the provision of urban
services (see Annex 1 for details) and made recommendations for the improvement
of their delivery and cost recovery. In addition, under the Project, GOT will
study in more detail the cost of providing urban services and their cost recovery
mechanisms (see Annex 9). Under the Municipal Finance Program (para. 1.21), the
Government will launch a study regarding cost recovery of urban services by
December 31, 1993 and complete it by December 31, 1995   Application of the
resulting reforms is estimated to increase revenues on account of direct cost
recovery (revenue on charges) by a factor of 3 by 2000 (from about TD 13 million
in 1990 to about TD 45 million in 2000). These enhanced revenues would increase
as a percentage of total municipal current expenses (from about 12 percent before
1990 to about 21 percent in 2000) and would increase in relation to investment
from about 27 percent before 1990 to about 45 percent in 2001.
11 I.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
A.  Flow of Funds
3.01        The proposed US$75 million loan would be made at the standard Bank
variable interest rate with repayment in 17 years, including a five-year grace
period. It would be made to GOT: about US$2 million would be allocated to MOl
and MOF for technical assistance; US$72 million would be onlent in local currency
to MDA either for further onlending or, in the case of low-income neighborhood
upgrading, for subloans and grants to municipalities; and about US$1 million
would be made available to MDA on a grant basis for its institutional
strengthening. MDA would repay the Bank funds onlent to it by GOT over 17 years
at the Bank rate, in effect at the time of the signing of the subsidiary
agreement between GOT and MDA. GOT would bear the foreign exchange rate risk.
Funds onlent by MDA to municipalities would bear interest at the rates outlined
in para. 2.19 (d) and have matur'ties of no more than 15 years, including two
years grace. GOT would also, for the Eighth Plan, finance MDA through FCCL in
the amount of about  S$S50 million and through direct budgetary transfer in the
amount of about US$5S0 million. Because the local resource mobilization would
improve over time (local tax reform, increased cost recovery, better technical
and managerial c&pacities of the municipalities), and in order to decrease
progressively the Central Government transfers to the municipalities mentioned
abova, MDA is expected to increase its interest rate toward market rates in the
long term to enable municipalities to tap some financial resources directly from
the financial markets.   As a condition of loan effectiveness, a subsidiary
agreement between GOT and MDA for the transfer of loan proceeds would be signed.



- 20 -
Durina necotiation., agreement was reached on the amount of the Government's
transfers to MDA both via the FCCL and directly to MDA (para. 1.21).

3.02       Most of the subloans would be supplemented by matching grants from
the Central Government. The matching grants vary according to the incentives
that GOT wants tu give to certain types of investments. Matching grants have
been defined by GOT. They are higher for non-revenue-producing projects and zero
for revenue-producing projects ouch as markets as shown below (Figure 11). GOT
will provide matching grants and loan funds to MDA for the benefit of the
municipalities as follows:

B.   Eliaibilitv Criteria for Municipalities and Subprolects Selection
Beneficiaries Entities
3.03        All local governments (municipalities and regional councils) and
their agencies and enterprises would potentially be eligible to participate,
provided they meet the project eligibility criteria specified in para. 3.04
below.
Eliaibilitv Criteria
3.04        During negotiations, agreement was reached with MDA on criteria to
be met for financing subprojects with Bank funds. These criteria will be defined
in the Operation Manual (para. 3.05). Summarized in Annex 7, they are specific
to each sector and reflect the technical and financial feasibility of each
subproject and the adequacy of its implementation arrangements, and its
environmental soundness, in particular for sensitive subsectors such as solid
waste and slaughterhouses. Revenue-generating entities must comply with cost-
recovery principles. Eligibility criteria for municipalities would include (a)
minimum debt-service coverage ratio of 1.3 (para. 2.18) and (b) adequate
implementation capacity. Finally, agreement was reached during neaotiations that
the total amount of all grants made for a subproject for low-income neighborhoods
would not exceed the total amount of all subloans made for that subproject.
3.05        A draft Lending Operation Manual was reviewed during appraisal and
found acceptable to the Bank (see sunamary in Annex 7). These procedures would
apply until finalization of MDA's Operation Manual. Adoption of the Operation
Manual would be a condition of effectiveness.
Pipeline Develogment
3.06        The appraisal mission reviewed the 1992-96 PIC,  out of which
subprojects have been selected for the project; thereafter MDA with ARRU's
assistance has appraised and submitted to the Bank a first tranche of typical
large municipal subprojects. To maintain a pipeline of investment proposals
suitable for MDA financing, MDA has a technical assistance and outreach program
for preinvestment studies.   The program will finance services of national
agencies, such as ARRU, and consultants familiar with MDA policies and
requirements who will assist candidate borrowers in the preparation of planning
and pre-feasibility studiea, institutional studies, coordination and quality
control of feasibility and detailed engineering studies, the design of
institutional development measures to be included in subprojects, and
environmental impact assessments. The financing of these studies will be made
as grants by MDA to municipalities if the studies do not lead to a project; if
the study leads to a subproject and a subloan, its cost will be integrated into
the subloan.



- 22 -
Bank Review of Subvrolects
3.07        The Bank will review MDA's appraisal and draft lending document
before subloan approval by MDA for (a) the first two subprojects in each eligible
subsector; and (b) each subloan, which, when added to any grant made for the
subproject, amounts to more than US$0.5 million. For all subprojects, and prior
to related disbursement or replenishment of the special account, the Bank will
receive executive summaries of subprojects and beneficiaries. Sample reviews of
subprojects in execution will be carried out by the Bank during supervision
missions. MDA, DGCPL, and the Project Coordinator will retain all documentation
for review by Bank missions. During negotiations, the above review process was
agreed.
C.   Implementation Arranaement/lIstitutional 8etuo
3.08        The Borrower would be GOT and MOI would have the principal project
oversight responsibility (Figure 12).  Together with the MOP, the Government
would identify the budgetary means necessary for the project. Under the project:
- DGCPL (under MOI), with the participation of MOF for the local
tax  reform,  would  be  responsible  for  implementing  the
institutional development component, establishing (including
issuance of decree if required) a Training Directorate,
nominating its proposed Director, and hiring two additional
professional staff before loan effectiveness.
- DDA, under the supervision of MO0, would be responsible for
implementing MDA's restructuring, and appraising and financing
the municipal investments.
- Local governments would be responsible for carrying out the
municipal investments and elements of the MDP.
- Day-to-day project coordination and management of the studies
would be the responsibility of a Project Coordinator (in place
since November 1991) reporting directly to the State Secretary
for Municipalities in OI.
- The consultative steering committee (Comit6 de Suivi), chaired by
the State Secretary of Municipalities of MOI and including the
main ministries concerned, which was created in 1989 to follow up
the feasibility study, would be maintained during the life of the
project to facilitate the coordination among the ministries
concerned.

3.09        GOT would prepare and submit to the Bank, within six months following
the closing date of the loan, a project completion report reviewing the extent
to which planned project objectives, including costs and benefits, were achieved,
and assessing the performance and contribution of all the parties associated with
the project.
D. Procurement - Disbursement
Procurement
3.10        Responsibility for procurement would be as follows: (a) DGCPL and the
Project Coordinator for the institutional development component; (b) MDA for
equipment and technical assistance related to its own restructuring; and (c) the
municipalities, or their designated agencies, for the municipal infrastructure
investments. As it is already the case now, if need be, the municipalities will
be assisted by ARRU or the regional directorate of the MEH; technical assistance
will also be available from MDA. Civil work contracts would be awarded through
local competitive bidding (LCB), under local procedures acceptable to the Bank,
except that works costing the equivalent of US$50,000 or less, up to an aggregate
of US$3 million, might be procured through negotiated contract. In addition,
works costing less than $100,000 might be procured on the basis of local shopping



- 24 -
from at least three contractors. Since the pipeline of subprojects would be (i)
dispersed over many sites across the country, (ii) committed separately for each
category of civil works over a period of three years, and (iii) executed and
administered by different municipalities over a four- to five-year period, it
would not be feasible to aggregate the contracts into packages large enough to
attract international contractors through ICB.  However, interested foreign
bidders would be eligible to participate. Although no large civil work contracts
are expected, if any civil works contract exceeds US$3 million, it would be
procured under ICB.
3.11        Equipment and material contracts estimated to cost up to US$100,000
would be obtained off the shelf after receiving quotations from at least three
suppliers, and those between US$100,000 and US$1,000,000 would be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with procedures
satisfactory to the Bank.  Procurement for goods for an amount greater than
US$1,000,000 is not expected to take place; in such a case, it will be carried
out through ICB.   Consultants financed with Bank funds will be recruited
according to the "Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers."
3.12        Prior Bank review and atproval will be required for all procurement
documents and contracts for the first two contracts for works procured under LCB,
and for all ICB procurement. After these initial contracts, prior review by the
Bank will be required for civil works contracts valued above US$1,000,000. Bank
supervision missions will review subprojects committed under the free-limit
threshold, with a particular focus on procurement proceduree. All other procure-
ment will be reviewed ex post on a selective basis. MDA, DGCPL, and the Project
Coordinator will retain all procurement documentation for review by Bank
missions. Durino negotiations, agreement was reached with GOT on all procure-
ment arrangements.  Figure 13 below summarizes the procurement arrangements for
the project.

Disbursement
3.13        The disbursement schedule of the Bank loan would be set at seven
years reflecting a slightly longer period than IBRD standard disbursement
profiles for the urban sector in Tunisia because of the inexperience of the
municipalities.  The estimated schedule of disbursement is provided in Annex 10.
The closing date of the project would be December 30, 1999. Loan proceeds would
be disbursed against:
(a)   Civil works. equipment. and materials for: construction, improvement
and rehabilitation of municipal infrastructure, including streets,
parks, drainage systems, street lighting, water supply and sewerage
systems, and solid waste collection, disposal, and treatment
systems;
(b)   Civil  works,  eauioment.  and  materials  for:  construction  and

of foreign expenditures and 80 percent of local expenditures.
3.14        The  Bank  will  not  finance  the  cost  of  land  acquisition,
administrative expenses, and taxes and duties. Retroactive financing of subloans
would be permitted for expenditures made after appraisal (November 7, 1991) on
eligible expenditures of institutional strengthening and municipal investments.
Aggregate expenditures for retroactive financing will not exceed US$7.5 million
(10 percent of the loan amount).

3.15        Withdrawal applications for contracts for technical assistance will
be supported by full documentation, as well as contracts valued above US$100,000
for computer equipment.   Disbursement for contracts related to civil works,
equipment, and materials under municipal subprojects would be made on the basis
of Statements of Exwenditure (SOEs) except for those requiring prior review
(para. 3.12). MDA and the Project Coordinator would be responsible for preparing
withdrawal applications for submission to the Bank.
3.16        Supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained by MDA and the
Project Coordinator and made available for review by Bank staff. To facilitate
the disbursement of funds from the Bank loan, a special account would be
established in the Central Bank of Tunisia with an initial deposit of US$3
million, equivalent to an average four-month disbursement. The Central Bank will
keep a separate account and documentation to support all withdrawals and
replenishment of the special account. An audit of that account will be carried
out by independent auditors, and a report will be submitted to the Bank within
six months after the end of each fiscal year. Durina necotiations, agreement was
reached for a special account up to US$3 million to be opened.
E.   Audit - Nonitorina
Audits
3.17        In order to establish a clean break between MDA#s old and new
operations, MOI has requested the audit of the old accounts before the new
accounts of MDA are established.  MDA and MOI would maintain separate project
accounts, each for the components under its responsibility, and would have them
audited annually by independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank. The
audits would include the operations of the special account and records of SOEs.
In addition, MDA would have its financial statements audited annually by
independent external auditors acceptable to, and under terms of reference
satisfactory to, the Bank.   The audit reports for all components would be
submitted to the Bank annually by June 30 for the previous year.   Durina



- 27 -
negotiations, agreement was reached that prior to June 30 of each year of project
implementation, MOI and MDA would furnish the Bank with separate, annual project
accounts audited by independent, external auditors acceptable to the Bankt and
that MDA would furnish the Bank with its annual financial statements audited by
independent, external auditors acceptable to the Bank, except that the audit
report for MDA*s old accounts would be ready before December 31, 1992.
Monitorino and Renortina
1a1.18      To monitor sector progress, MO and MDA have started to develop an
information system with indicators related to service coverage and to the
operational and financial performance of local governments. The system would be
the basis for preparing semi-annual project performance reports using agreed
formats and indicators. The Project Coordinator for the project as a whole, and
MDA for individual project components, would prepare semi-annual project progress
reports that would describe past achievements and compare them with appraisal
projections; provide a critical assessment of problems arising during project
execution; and propose remedial actions in case of unsatisfactory progrbss. The
December progress reports would also include, for the following year, the
proposed training program and the studies (including terms of reference) to be
financed under the project. The Project Coordinator and MDA would furnish the
Bank the project progress reports each year by June 30 and December 31, starting
in 1993. During negotiations, the format of the performance indicators shown in
Annex 11 was finalized; an understanding was reached with GOT that the Project
Coordinator and MDA would furnish the Bank with project progress reports, twice
each year, prior to June 30 and to December 31, starting in 1993.
Annual Reviews
3.19        Based on the audit and project performance reports described above,
the Ministries of Plan and Interior, and MDA, would carry out with the Bank each
year by November 15 formal joint reviews of progrecs achieved toward reaching the
objectives of the project. One of the annual reviews, two or three years into
project execution, would be expanded into a comprehensive mid-term review of
progress in project implementation. The reviews would provide a forum to assess
project issues such as the performance of project executing agencies (including
the need for training and technical assistance), progress in training activities
and the efficacy of the training provided, collection performance of the local
taxes, the onlending terms and financial policies of MDA, and the quality of
subprojects. The review would also examine improvements in the capacities of the
municipalities toward their qualifying for commercial borrowing and graduation
from MDA borrowing. If necessary, the reviews would lead to the formulation of
plans for remedial actions.
IV.   PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A.   Benefits
4.01        Economic benefits would mainly materialize in the form of increased
land values in subproject areas.   The provision of solid waste disposal



- 28 -
facilities, marketplaces, and slaughterhouses--together with sanitary precautions
and sound waste disposal schemes--would help reduce the negative health and
environmental impact resulting from the haphazard food processing and waste
management arrangements now prevalent in many communities. Street maintenance
subprojects would yield savings in vehicle operating costs, while helping to
reduce congestion-related air contamination from vehicle exhaust. In addition
to its impact on vehicle operating costs and land value, the paving or repair of
urban streets would help reduce the production of dust particles by vehicular
traffic on unpaved or broken road surfaces, with beneficial effects on air
quality and health. Improving the coverage of basic services would primarily
benefit low-income areas. Indirect benefits would accrue from the execution of
more cost-effective projects, the improvement of management capabilities at local
level, the application of more transparent service pricing, improved
institutional arrangements, and human resources development.
B.   Economic Justification
4.02        Eligibility criteria for subprojects costing more than US$1 million
would include a minimal economic and financial rate of return (ERR) and financial
rate of return (FRR) of 12 percent each. Durina necotiations, agreement was
reached that MDA would carry out a rate of return analysis for each of the
subprojects costing more than US$1 million, and that it would not finance
subprojects above US$1 million with an ERR or FRR below 12 percent.
c.   Environmental Aspects
4.03        Potential environmental problems associated with the project concern
waste disposal from slaughterhouses, households, and market facilities.
Accordingly, the project has been placed on environmental screening, category B.
To prevent such problems, MDA would not finance any solid waste subproject, even
if the sub-borrower's request is limited to the collection system, unless an
environmentally sound final disposal scheme exists or is implemented under the
same subproject. Similar safeguards would be built into the eligibility criteria
for marketplaces and slaughterhouses currently under preparation. In addition,
the project would introduce systematic analyses of infrastructure investments by
MDA. The institutional strengthening elements for the municipalities and for MDA
would help them to develop their capacity to do environmental screening and
in pact assessments. Subloan requests for slaughterhouses, solid waste management
or sewerage subprojects will include an environmental impact assessment as part
of the submitted documentation as requested by Tunisian regulations.   The
technical staff in MDA would include an environmental specialist to coordinate
end monitor the environmental assessments submitted by the municipalities and to
identify potential problems at the pre-feasibility phase of subproject
preparation so that the specialist can alert the municipalities to the need for
careful consideration of environmental  impact at project appraisal.   The
Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) will be further reviewed and approved by the
Agency for Environmental Protection (ANPE), which by law is the national
environmental agency responsible for all environment aspects.  Furthermore, MDA
would include in its project preparation guidelines a manual defining
environmental precautions and mitigation measures to be taken in subproject
execution.   Internal procedures and environment guidelines for environmental



- 29 -
review will be developed by MDA and ANPE and would be adopted through the
Operation Nanual of NDA, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank before loan
effectiveness (See Annex 7 for details).
4.04        In part, the project is meant to address infrastructure shortages in
established settlements. It would support limited infrastructure development in
areas not previously urbanized with minimal negative environmental impact. The
investment  subprojects  in the solid waste  sector would have  a positive
environmental impact on beneficiary municipalities and on urban agglomerations
downstream of sites where discharge treatment and controls take place.
D.   Risks and Bafacuards
4.05        Improving local services and municipal management nationwide is an
ambitious undertaking and will require a sustained effort in the years ahead.
The project is complex, and its implementation involves a large number of
agencies, many of which are institutionally weak. Risks include the possibility
of: (a) inadequate project preparation capacity at the local level, resulting in
slow implementation or low quality of subprojects; and (b) political pressures
undermining conditionalities introduced in NDA lending.
4.06        The project would also face some financial risks because the reforms
necessary to increase the resources of NDA and the municipalities may not
materialize or may suffer delays. The risk that these shortages may occur and
threaten the financial viability of NDA, the municipalities or both is not large
because the past practice of GOT has consistently been to reduce investments in
the face of scarce financial resources while ensuring timely servicing of the
debt.   The municipal sector has not been an exception to this conservative
practice, since funds are allocated first to cover operating expenses and debt
service with the remainder for investments.    In addition, monitoring of the
proposed financial covenants and performance indicators would provide an early
warning and compliance with covenants would ensure against financial default.
While compliance with financial covenants would ensure financial viability, the
size of the municipal sector investment program may vary from the one
anticipated. A more detailed analysis of financial risk is in Annex 6.
4.07        The project includes measures to address these risks.  While the
project would help build up subproject preparation capabilities, the scale of the.
project does not entail too substantial an increrse from the past municipal
investments during the Seventh Economic Plan (1987-91)--that is, about US$350
million during the Seventh Plan to about US$470 million for the Eighth Plan
(1992-96).   To ensure adherence to onlending conditionality, the Bank would
review the larger subprojects prior to approval by NDA and subloans amounting to
more than US$0.5 million prior to approving disbursements. The annual review of
important project issues would lead to timely plans of action to remedy
identified shortcomings. Key project entities would be strengthened as part of
the project and committed to achieve targets that can be monitored.  purina
negotiations, a Supervision Plan (see Annex 10) was finalized.

ANNEX I
Page 1 of 2
REPBIC OF TUNI8IA
ItUCIPAL SECTOR XIVSTUEN  PROJECT
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR URBAN SERVICES
Dharina of capacities
Production of urban services involves five categories of
institutions:
-     ministries and public administrations;
-     national public enterprises (national companies, agencies, offices);
-     regional administrations;
-     municipalities; and
-     local operators (regional transport companies, associations, local
authorities).
Table  1  indicates  the  list  of  local  services,  relevant
responsibilities for their operation and the origin of funds covering the
operation of each service.   As to the  responsibilities  involved, three
possibilities are described:
-     direct management: the responsible institution provides funds and
manages the infrastructure;
-     mixed managementt local govern-ent is the main executing agency but
programming and financing of infrastructure involve another
institution;
-     delegated management: the institution participates in the execution
or in the maintenance of infrastructure with funds provided by the
executing agency, i.e. ministries or public local governments.
The involvement of municipalities in urban public services is
therefore restricted to construction, operation, and maintenance of refuse
collection and municipal buildings, management and control of slaughterhouses and
markets, household garbage collection and disposal, street lighting, execution
and management of some community facilities in the areas of sports, culture,
nursery schools, and some actions in the area of environment protection.
Municipalities intervene competitively or jointly with ONAS in some situations
such as extension of utilities in poor neighborhoods or execution of utilities
in areas not covered by ONAS.

ANNEX 2
Page 1 of 3
REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
MUNICIPAL SECTOR INVESIUENT PROJBCT
IOCAL GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND TUEIR SUPERVISION
Local Government organizations are subject to a threefold
supervision: administrative, financial and technical.
A. Administrative Sunervision
Local Government organizations or ounicipalities are subject to a
double administrative supervisiont the central one exercised by the Ministry of
Interior, and the regional one exercised by the Governorate.
Central Government supervisions The Ministry of Interior.
Supervision exercised by the central Government has been reduced to
the benefit of the regional level.   The Ministry of Interior (MO!), and
particularly the General Directorate for Public Local Governments (DGCPL),
remains nevertheless responsible for:
-     creation and suppression of municipalities;
-     changes in names, boundary limits, and transfer of seats;
-     dissolution and/or suspension of municipal council;
-     dismissal and/or suspension of the chairman and deputies;
-     arbitration of conflicts between Governor and municipal council;
-     approval of council's debates concerning general and some financial
and economic aspects of municipalities life;
-     organization of municipalities, national conferences;
-     provision, upon their request, of official of the central government
to undertake the functions of secretary general or responsible for
the technical services.
Regional Government supervision: the Governor.
The Main Law on Municipalities (Loi Organique des Communes) of 1975
and the Main Law No. 85-43 of April 25, 1985 modifying the Main Law on
Municipalities referred to above, strengthens the authority of the governor in
relation to the central Government and transfers to him the prerogatives conceded
by the 1975 law to the delegates.        The governor exercises administrative
supervision of the aunicipal council, the staff and ounicipal services.
All decisions by the municipal council need to be approved by the
governor in order to be executory (art. 42 of the 1975 Main Law on
Municipalities, and art. 43.45 and 46 of the amended version of the Main Law on
municipalities, decree No. 85-43).



- 35 -
ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 3
B. Financial sunervision
Reference can be made to the Main Law on Municipalities, the Main Law
on Local Government Budget and the Code of Public Accounting.
All important financial actions of the local governments are sub4ect
to the approval of the supervising authority. This includes important investzment
projects, budget approval, financial accounts, budget procedures, bud!,etary
transfers, establishment of municipal enterprises, local public enterprises,
financial participation, borrowing, and approval of local public contracts. The
financial supervision authority has the power to reject, reduce, and in some
instances substitute.
Supervision is performed by the Ministries of Finance and of Interior
for municipalities whose revenues in title I of the budget are equal or superior
to 2 million dinars (i.e., municipalities of Tunis, Sfax, Sousse, Ariana, Gabbs)
and for municipalities showing a deficit in the last fiscal year. Budgets for
municipalities with revenues, in Title I, under 2 million dinars, are approved
by the governors.
C. Technical Suvervision
Technical supervision is complex and involves several ministries and
public enterprises. Technical supervision is exercised at the central, as well
as regional, level.
Ilannin/oroaraHMinS  and  imalementation  of urban  gnblic  servicest    The
municipalities administer the traditional municipal services; e.g., municipal
refuse collection, street lighting, slaughterhouses, markets, cemeteries. They
also provide household garbage collection and disposal and fire protection
services. With the ministries concerned, they contribute to the execution of
social infrastructure.
Central Government Supervision:   The Central Government intervenes in the
programming and social infrastructure (hospitals, universities, sport complexes)
and in the execution of some public programs with national sector enterprises,
such as AFE and SNIT for land development and construction, and ARRU for
rehabilitation operations.
Regional Government Supervisiont The implementation of infrastructure master
plans is generally executed by the Regional Services of the Ministries and
national agencies concerned such as DREE, SONEDE and STEG.
Some social infrastructure of local and regional importance (post
offices, primary and secondary schools, basic health centers) is managed by the
Regional Councils.  The regional services of the concerned ministries are
responsible for their programing. Municipalities are not consulted by regional
services, except for sports and cultural infrastructure.

REPUBLIC OF TUN8X1A
NMNICIPAL SECTOR INVES!IENT PROJECT
HUY4ICXPAL PVNANCB
1.          Structure. municipal financial records are organized into a standard
public accounting structure (similar to the French system) that includes current
revenues and current operating expenses (under Title X), and development revenues
and investments (under Title II). Annual budgets constitute a fixed program of
resources and expenses which can only be changed significantly by following the
same procedure required for initial approval. Operating expenses make up the
bulk of costs for municipal administration. Labor costs account for more than
half the current expenditures. Buildings and roads comprise the majority of
direct capital investments. Municipal funds that are not expended at the end of
a fiscal year are transferred to an open account and used as a Reserve Fund for
the development of municipal facilities and/or to cover future deficits. These
reserves have grown steadily. Key principles involved in the budgeting process
are that:
budgets must be balanced overall and within each Title, and
budget authority must be renewed each year for each item in
the budget.
Municipal budgets are thus on a cash-basis operating on an annual cycle. While
this approach way be an effective means of control, it prevents many
municipalities from spending even the limited amount of development funds that
they have.
2.          Local governments in Tunisia obtain the majority of their revenues
from five basic sources.
Current revenues are obtained fromt
local taxes that include tax on rental income, business tax,
hotel tax and tax on undeveloped land; and
fees and service charges for slaughterhouses and markets, land
transactions, buildings, rentals, services rendered, and
miscellaneous.
DevelopeQnt revenues are obtained fromt
national transfers that include formula share and reserve
funds;
project specific national aid from the Ministry of Youth and
Sports, the Ministry of Public Works, and the Ministry of
Cultural Affairs; and
-     loans and grants from CPSCL/MDA, and other specific grants.

Revenues
3.          Municipal Fund (FCCL). The objective of the revision of the current
operation of the Fund would be to improve the allocation of the transfers among
different municipalities, by including explicit criteria concerning efficient
distribution (based on taxes generated in each area), fair redistribution
mechanism for poorer localities and the relatively higher per capita needs of
larger cities.
4.          Local Taxes.  The new Direction G6n6rale d'Etudes et de la R6forme
Fiscale is determined to have a draft law of local taxation ready and approved
by the end of 1992. The mission discussed with several commission members the
main principles of the proposed reforms, that should focus on a redefinition of
the base of the present tax on rental income and on improved collection
efficiency, as well as on higher levels of cost recovery from beneficiaries in
those cases where they can be identified. Some of the present rates need to be
revised, either because they are excessive (like the "taxe locative", which is
a theoretical 24 percent of the imputed rental value) or too low, such as the tax
on hotels, which is not subject to either the property (residential) tax nor the
tax on industrial and service activities.
5.          Tax on rental income ("Taxe Locative"). There seems to be a general
consensus regarding the need to transform the current "taxe locative" into a less
ambiguous  property  tax  (the  present  definition  makes  it  a  hybrid
property/residential tax) to be applied to all properties, whether used for
professional, commercial, industrial, or residential purposes. This would be a
clear improvement over the current situation, where the base is limited to
residential properties. In the absence of a proper fiscal cadastre, the tax
would continue to be based on imputed rental values. A proposal to introduce,
in addition to the property tax, a residential tax reflecting the use made of
municipal services on "head" basis is also under consideration, but might face
reluctance because of the additional collection costs it would imply.
6.          Business tax (TCL).  This tax is now paid by industrialists and
service providers on the basis of the turnover of the firm, and benefits the
municipalities where the parent company is located, without any consideration for
the location of the production units. The revised law is likely to introduce
some criteria for the objective distribution of the revenues collected, to ensure
that they go to the municipalities where the local ser-irc.s are used. A revision
of the rates is also needed, in particular to eliminate the ceiling. There see s
to be also a consensus regarding the need to raise the current ceiling for the
TCL (TD 20,000 per year) to TD 50,000 per year, but it would be preferable to
eliminate the ceiling altogether and introduce a scale of declining rates.
7.          User fees and contributions. Ideally, the cost of providing services
should be recovered from userr whenever these can be easily identified. This is
the case of beneficiaries of land development, for instance, or market stands,
parking, and a variety of other services. In Tunisia, there is a disparity of
views concerring the recovery of land development costs through special
contributions from beneficiaries, since several concerned authorities claim that
no cost recovery was carried out in the past and it would therefore be unfair to
residents of newly developed areas, who are likely to belong to the poorer
groups.

Page 3 of 3
8.          A second issue concerning user fees is the need for flexibility for
the municipalities to modify the charges for services, in particular those
rendered to clearly identifiable users, such as those using market facilities,
parking, etc. So far all municipal taxes and fees are established by decree and
are revised only rarely, which seriously reduces the buoyancy of the related
income. However, there are divergent views on the constitutionality of allowing
local governments to set tax rates, but the possibility to recover the cost of
services rendered through freely determined user fees does not seem to pose a
problem. Specific proposals concerning other potential revenue sources such as
vehicle tags, additional parking, etc., are being discussed.
Imnroved collection efficiency
9.          Collection levels for local taxes are extremely low.  For instance,
the actual revenue from the tax on rental income amounts only to TD 3 par capita
on average (2.3 excluding Tunis). The legislation allows for punitive actions
to be taken in case of non payment, but the law is rarely applied for lack of
material means and political willingness. All parties agree that there is room
for improvement in collection, through reassignment of responsibilities among
state and local collection agencies, modernization of taxpayer rolls,
simplification of publication procedures, and intensification of personnel and
equipment. The MSIP feasibility study has proposed concrete actions in this
respect, including possibilities to make increased use of computer technologies
in the preparation of taxpayers lists and in cross-referencing different taxpayer
files, as well as wider use of specific collection centers for some local taxes.
This is going to be reviewed and officially proposed by the Directorate of Taxes.

REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
MUNICIPAL SECTOR INVESTIINT PROJECT
MUNICIPAL STAFF AND TRAMNING PROGRAM
A.  ackaround
The number of civil servants in the Tunisian municipalities is not
very high; the 18,000 existing positions correspond indeed to 4 civil servants
for 1,000 inhabitants, compared with 18 for 1,000 inhabitants in France.
Moreover, the distribution is uneven: the number of civil servants for the three
largest cities amounts to over a third of the total staff.
Most of the municipalities (190 with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants)
have in fact very little personnel to fulfill the tasks: between 10 (fewer than
5,000 inhabitants) and 38 (10 to 20,000 inhabitants) is the average.   The
municipalities with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants cannot afford to appoint one
civil servant at least, to each sector of activities. Moreover the distribution
is unevent administrative civil servants represent 17 percent, technical civil
servants 3 percent, and workers 85 percent of the total staff.
The education level is generally poor; 7% only of the civil servants
have a level of education corresponding to baccalaur6at, 25% have done six years
of secondary school and the education level for the remaining two thirds is very
limited or non-existent. This distribution translated into figures gives the
followingt
A + B (Baccalaur6at + University training)         1,200 civil servants
C     (high school diploma)                        4,500 civil servants
D + 8 (primary school)                            12,500 civil servants
These figures illustrate clearly one of the main difficulties
encountered by most of the Tunisian municipalities:
-     the civil servants' level of education is generally poor, which
reduces their capacities to exercise the tasks expected from them;
and
-     the number of managerial staff is limited at the executive level as
well as at the middle management level: just over 1,000 civil
servants in total, most of them being in the big cities, which
leaves an average of one Category A or B agent for the small
municipalities.
In short, the number of civil servants is limited, their
qualifications are poor, and the number of managers is also too low; these are
conditions which do not favor the smooth running of municipal services.
S. Personnel Re-uireaents
We have seen that there are uneven situations, main municipalities

Page 2 of 18
like Tunis having a larger number of civil servants in relation to their
populations,  while many  small municipalities  are deprived.   Under these
conditions, strengthening of personnel should be envisaged during the coming
years. Three factors justify the need for strengthening communal staff through
a recruitment plan which will be executed over the yearss
-     quantitative and qualitative lack of adaptation of actual staff, in
relation to the needs of the current organization;
-     foreseeable evolution of the needs due to quantitative evolution of
demand (more population, more roads, more street lights); and
-     necessary  enrichment  of  municipal  services,  thus,  municipal
responsibilities.
Clearly, this need for strengthening is not the same for all
sunicipalities, as their initial situation as well as their evolution are
different. A few scenarios are possible:
-     trimming of staff, following productivity gains made possible by
better management or computerization;
"remedial" recruitment allowing municipalities to address current
deficiencies by means of stabilized activities;
recruitment made necessary by development of new activities or the
need of higher qualifications.
It is therefore necessary to proceed by steps over the period (up to
2001)t
during the first five years (1990 to 1994 included)
-     reassessment of the importance of management;
-     stable number of staff will be maintained for the other
categories of staff;
during the seven following years (1995 to 2001 included)
-     Lumber of civil servants for the different categories will
vary according to increase of urban population.
1990-1994 Period
During this period, the number of civil servants will be increased.
Its current low number represents one of the main difficulties faced by
municipalities. Recruitment of civil servants is indispensable to improving the
efficiency of services.   Of the 1,200 A and 3 civil servants working in
municipalities, 600 are located in the five groups of sunicipalities with a
population under 100,000 inhabitants, and 600 are located in the three main
cities (staxting with Tunis). In the first case, the 600 A and B civil servants
supervise 12,000 civil sorvants belonging to the other categories, i.e. a ratio
of about 5%. In the second case, the 600 A and B civil servants supervise about
5 to 6,000 civil servants from the other categories, i.e. a ratio of about 10%.



- 42 -
Page 3 of 18
In order to improve officiency, this supervision ratio should reach 15%, i.e. 5%
of tho A civil servants and 10% of the a category. on the base of the standard
organisation charts proposed for each category of municipalities, it is admitted
that an average municipality belonging to this category, needs to have
supervisory personnel responsible for the supervision of the units showed on the
chart. An assessmoet of the theoretical needs in supervisory staff is obtained
this way for each municipality.   If this assessment is extended to all
municipalities belonging to this category (by multiplying volumes obtained by the
number of municipalities in tho category), and if this process is then extended
to all categories, an assessment of the theoretical needs in supervisory staff
is obtained for all categories.
Staff estmates shows that, with respect to 243 municipalities with
a population under 100,000 inhabitants, the number of civil servants must triple
in five years (from 577 to 1,800. With respect to the three municipalities with
a population over 100,000, the number of civil servants must increase from 600
to 750.  Particular attention nueds to be paid to this situation as data
available on Tunis and Ariana are incomplete; moreover, A and B civil servants
include some civil servants who do not work in the services. Staff of the other
categories (C,D and 8) remain the same, with a global number of 12,000 for
municipalities with less than 100,000, and about 5,000 for the main cities.
1995-2001 Poriod
As of 1995, the number of civil servants of the different categories
will vary according to the urban population increase, to take into consideration
additional tasks and needs induced by this increase.
The proposed rate of increase is 4 percent, which is within the range
of population increase studied by the National Institution of Statistics (INS)
for the urban population until 2001.
At the end of the period (1995-2001), there is therefore an increase
of 30% of the staffs
for categories A and B civil servants, an increase of 800 civil
servants, so that the supervisory rate remains at 15%;
-     for the other categories (C, D, 5), an increase of 5,300 civil
servants.
in 2001, the total number of civil servants amounts therefore to
25,725, i.e.
-      3,356 A and B civil servants
-     22,371 civil servants for the other categories (C, D, 8).
These e*stiates are reasonable as the financial situation of munLcipalities
is unfavorable avd the recrultment needs to remaln compatible wlth the personnel
expenditures withln the current budget. Even if there are clvil servants in the
country, it w1il probably be difflcult to make them work for municipalities. The
assumptLons mentioned here do not take into consideration the aging of personnel
and retlrements. The DGCPL study does not glve data concerning age of staff, and
information gathered in a few municipalLties is too incomplete to draw
conclusions.

C   Trainina Situation
Municipalities do not have (with a very few exceptions) a service or
office specifically for training. Services or personnel offices are supposed to
take care of training problems, but this represents a very limited aspect of
their activities. Evon in large municipalities, it does not appear that there
are civil servants in charge of the training function in the personnel office.
Xn fact, personnel sanageaent appears to be mainly the administrative
manageament of personnel files, and not a real management policy and highlight of
human resources, which would include an important training component. Civil
servants of the services of personnel do not know what has been done in the
training area, and under what conditions some training courses are organized.
They have little knowledge about the training agencies, do not know exactly what
their activities are, they do not have training programs but do not recognize the
need for them.
The financing of training is not currently provided for, but this has
not presented any difficulty until now, in view of the very limited number of
organized actions and of civil servants concerned. There are no payments to be
made to a training organixation, but there are no funds provided in the budget
for training actions.
The 1985 laws include the possibility of training leave for civil
servants who will be authorized to pursue several months' training in order to
be entitled to promotion within their category.  According to the available
information, the possibility exists, but appears currently very limited. As of
now, ministries' schools and public enterprises' training centers are proposing
actions in different fields. Nevertheless this remains occasional and does not
correspond to a coherent policy related to training of municipalities' staff.
In fact, DGCPL - in the Ministry of Xnterior (MOX) whose role is
particularly important in the management of municipalities' staff - is unable to
play an important role ir, the definition and implementation of a training policy
for municipalities' staff.  Its means are far too limited; within the sub-
directorate for Administrative Affairs, the personnel and training service
includes one service chief and four civil servants, which prevents it from
assisting in the fields concerned.
Despite these weaknesses, DGCPL, with the assistance of ENA and other
public enterprises, has be,n able to organize training activities during the last
three years:
training session organized by STEG for workers and employees in
charge of the maintenance of electric utilities;
seamnar  for  civil  servants  responsible  for  town  planning
regulations;
training sessions organized by ENA on civil status; and



- 45 -
ANNEX 4
Page 6 of 18
training sessions organised by RNA on personnel management, public
sarkets regulations; and health control.
These training activities have benefitted a total of 2,000 civil
servants.
Professional training (basic as well as in-service), in fact, exists
for municipal civil servants, but it in still very limited and clearly
insufficient to satisfy the enormous needs.
D. Nain Areas for Tralnga
in view of the initial training and professional capacities level of
the civil servants and the small number of actLons set up until now, the needs
for continuous learning are important in all areas.
Xt has therefore appeared necessary to review the different sectors
mplILed in the services activities and to indLcate the main areas whlch seem
important under the current conditions.  The followLng tables indicate the
categories of staff concerned, whlch are essentially the tutelle, executives,
middle management, administrative employees and workers. The areas shown remain
general as lt ls not possLble neither efficient to make an exhaustive list of
needs, ln view of the possibiLity to organise one or teu training sessions, with
more or less detailed contents, for civil servants at different levels.

in addition to those needs concerning the improvement of managers and
civil servants, there is another need which seems important for the future. It
concerns the basic training of civil servants who will be recruited in
administrative am well as technical areas. This applies to a much more limited
number of persons (about a thousand over several years), but it will allow a
significant strengthening of the municipal service capacities.
The staff recruited will be young graduates from secondary school,
with no professional experience and no particular knowledge of the municipal
environment. They should receive several months training in urbain matters so
that they can quickly become operational.
E. Trainina Proaram for the Eiahth Plan (1992-961
Training is currently limited for municipal personnel, and needs are
very important due to the number of civil servants concerned and the variety of
actions to be organized. Under these conditions, it is essential to set the
priorities to be implemented in a two-year priority program.
1) Obiectives
-    correct the most obvious deficiencies at different levels;
-    reach the main sectors of municipalities' intervention;
-    emphasize the importance of supervision;
population more reduced and easier to take into account
(higher level);
indispensable support and relay for development of training;
-    increase the inportance of relationships between training agencies
and municipalities;
-    partially and gradually orient State training towards the needs of
municipal civil servants.

3) Costs Estimates
Training courses
All activities will be subcontracted to different schools and public
enterprises (ENA, ENIT, OFPE) each in its area of competence. Costs would be
negotiated with each of them. Calculations are based upon:
-       an  average  training  cost  of  TD  35/day/trainee,  costs  being
practically the same for all schools and public enterprises;
-    travelling expenses of TD 10/trainee;
-       accommodation expenses of TD 25/day/trainee.
Except for the training of trainers, most expenses relative to this
priority program will be paid in local currency.

Trainina of Trainers
Training of trainers   is a priority action which needs to be
established during project startup. One month's training in specialized foreign
institutions for about 15 trainers should represent the necessary minimum.
Corresponding cost is as follows:
training session (25 man-month) x 4,000              TD 100,000
travel 25 x 500                                          12,500
daily allowance 25 x 30 x 80.                            60000
Total                                                TD 172,000
Trainina of vouna araduates
The priority program includes the training of about one hundred young
graduates to local management. Cost estimates for this activity are based on 60
days of theoretical and practical training (on-the-job training sessions..):
training 385 x 60 x 35                               TD 808,500
travel 385 x TD 50/ trainee                              19,250
daily allowance 385 x 25 x 60                           577.500
Total                                                 1,405,250
Summary of cost for 1992-96 nrogram:
- training of municipality staff                   TD 1,400,000
and elected
- training of trainers                                  172,000
- training of young graduates                         1,405,250
Total                                              TD 2,977,250
The training of young graduates would be financed solely by
Government funds. The training of trainers and the retraining of municipal staff
would be financed under the project.
4) Execution and Timetable
One-third of these activities can reasonably be envisaged over the
first two years while the remaining two-thirds would be executed over the next
three years.  This will depend mainly on the establishment of the training
directorate and the good will of schools and public enterprises.
Executing agency:  MOI's training directorate, which wlll call on the three
following entities to set up training activities and help municipalities defining
their needs:
-     ZNA for administrative training
-     ENIT for high-level technical training
-     OFPE for middle-level technical training
Each of these entities may call on other entities for specific

activities. Once training units have been established, the capacity of these
entities should be used in a decentralized way, ensuring that real needs of
municipalities are fulfilled.
F. Lonoer-torm Proaram Prooosal
The effect of the proposed program will be evaluated at the end of
the Plan period in 1996. It is expected that a program at least equivalent to
this one will be proposed and implemented for the Ninth Plan (1997-2001)

G. xstablishment of a Training System
The precise definition of a long-term program and its establishment
can materialize only if a real training system in installed. This system will
imply the creation of a training directorate and also different measures to be
taken at the municipalities level.
1) Trainino Directorate
The Government has decided to call on existing entities instead of
creating a new structure. This implies the establishment of a light structure
aimed at ensuring consistency throughout the Project.
2) Role
-     Coordinate the organization and implementation of priority program:
definition of actions
negotiations with training entities
management of funds
programming and follow-up of activities
assessment of training activities and possible modifications
-     Collaborate with training entities to adapt training activities to
municipalities needs and train their trainers;
-     Ensure  establishment  and  follow-up  of  training  program  for  young
graduates;
-     Provide technical assistance to municipalities (and eventually to regional
structures):
establishment of training offices and strengthening of capacities
for civil servants in charge of training management
selection of methods for establishment of training plans
-     Organize actions aimed at sensitizing elected officials and managers as
to the importance of human resources ,management and training on the
improvement of municipalities' operation;
-     Define a longer-term program;
-     Obtain training financing. The short-term financing Ieing provided by the
Project, it is necessary to establish a regular and sustained financing
plan for the future, where municipalities would contribute 1 to 2% of
their wage bill;
-     Organize distribution and complementarity of roles between training
entities;
-     Establish "final" coordination structure.
3) Description of Activities
Beginning with project startup of the Project, a training directorate
should be established within the Ministry of Interior, as a link between
municipalities and training entities. This training unit will call upon three
entities--ENA, ENIT and OFPE--which will act on its behalf.   The training
directorate will have the authority to assess these entities, results, to modify
the conten..s of their actions, and to require special activities from them.



- 56 -
ANNEX 4
Page 17 of 18
The training directorate will work jointly with the project
coordinator to define the training program and budget. Funds will be managed by
MDA under the authority of the training directorate.   External technical
assistance should be provided for the establishment and the startup of the
training unit.   This technical assistance should further help the unit in
assessing the training entities' actions.
Human Resources
-     head of the training unit
-     2 trainers (administrative and technical)
-     3 secretaries
-     1 archivist
Facilities
-     Rooms
3 managers' offices
3 secretaries, offices
1 documents room
*    1 meeting room
office equipment
furniture
personal computers
copy machine
equipment for filing, archives
equipment for meeting room (video, boards, projectors)
*    3 light vehicles
External Technical Assistance
-     Training experts to facilitate project implementation
-     Training sessions at CNFTP (French Municipal Training Center) for trainers
of the Training Unit
4)  Cost Estimates (Timetable)
The staff and facilities cost of the training directorate will be
part of MOI's budget. The only incremental costs included in the project are as
follows:
- Computers                            TD  22,000
- Other material                            55,000
- Training                                  46,000
- Technical assistance                      82.000
TOTAL                                 TD 205,000
5) Mumicigalities Level
The coordination structure will have a very important role to play
but municipalities must take responsibility as regard to training, particularly
ins

selection of civil servants who will be trained;
possibilities for the civil servants to implement new knowledge and new
techniques they have learned;
establishment of a service, office or agent - according to the size of the
municipality - assigned to training and appearing in the organizational
chart; that person's responsibility will be to sensitize elected
officials, civil servants and managers on the importance of training and
to make use of the existing possibilities; and
establishment of a training plan for middle and large municipalities, and
a status of needs for the small municipalities which should therefore
assess the situation.

RBPUMXIC OF TqNSIA
NMMICIPAL SECTOR INVESIINT PROJECT
MDA ORGAN!ZTToN - DRAFT oENERAL POLICY STMNfIHIW
The laws now in force give the Municipal Development Agency (MDA) a
vast array of attributions and a status of public, financially autonomous
organisation, allowing it to become a real Fund. But practice did not allow this
development.  The objective of the Tunisian authorities is to make MDA more
dynamic while maintaining its current status and strengthening its autonomy with
respect to the central administration. This objective implies:
=     the  establishment  of  a  system  which  clearly  defines  the
responsibilities of the central administration and MDA;
-     the adoption of strict procedures for project appraisal and follow-
up; and
the strengthening of MDA staff and the designation of a manager
experienced in financial matters and project appraisal.
A. MDA. Ceneral
a.  Status.  NDA is an administratively autonomous public organization.  Its
lending policy will be defined by the Ministry of Interior (MO!) in charge of its
supervision. MDA has the responsibility of complying with its financial policy.
b. oneral Objectives. MDA financially and technically supports the realization
of priority objectives defined by the Government in the area of municipal
development.
MDA's objectives are the following:
-     financial   assistance   to   municipalities,   associations   of
municipalities, Regional Councils and related public agencies, in
loans or advances for the financing of public operations;
-     technical assistance to municipalities to help then to identify
well-conceived priority projects, assessing their technical,
economic and financial feasibility and following up their execution;
-     with authorization of the Central Bank of Tunisia, receiviag, and
managing credit lines allocated to local Government investments such
as:
contribution from Local Government Common Fund (FCCL);
budget transfers;
credit lines from foreign lenders;
-     giving local governments the securities necessary to borrow from
other sources than MDA and managing those credits;

ANNeX 5
Page 2 of 7
c. Financin - Decisions. Decisions related to financing are taken at four levels
with clearly defined and complementary functions:
mOI 
-     monitors  the  financing  of  FCCL  contributions  and MDA budget
transfers;
-     upon MDA proposal, assesses other financing sources to lend to Local
Government;
-     upon MDA proposal, analyzes problems susceptible to hinder the
lending process in order to suggest possible solutions;
-     proposes transfers for each type of project and each category of
municipalities,  according  to  priorities  established  in  the
Development Plan.
The Hoard: The Board is chaired by a representative from MOI designated by
members who represent:
-     MO!                                  2
-     Ministry of Finance                  2
-     Ministry of Equipment & Housing      1
-     Ministry of Plan                     1
-     Central Bank                         1
-     Local Government elected officials  2
The main functions of the Board are to:
-     assess MDA's global situation, based on a quarterly report prepared
by the General Directorate, and make any decision necessary to
improve its management;
-     establish the yearly general lending program and submit it for
approval by the Ministries of Interior and Finance;
-     establish eligibility criteria for projects to be financed by DDA
and make necessary adjustments to the list of eligible projects;
-     establish yearly lending schemes for each sector to be financed and
each category of beneficiaries, which are submitted for approval by
the Ministries of Interior and Finance;
-     establish MDA personnel rules and regulations and remuneration
scheme; and
-     examine and consider loans exceeding TD 500,000.
The Loan Committee. The Loan Committee is a restricted representation of the
Board. It may call upon representatives from any mnistry or organization it
deems necessary   The Loan Committee is authorised by the Board to examine and
approve loans not exceeding TD 500,000 within the yearly general program; the
projects subsitted to the Loan Comittae's approval are first assessed by MDA as
well as their eligibility and approval criteria. Appraisal roports are sent with
two weeks in advance to the Loan Committee, together with the smeting date. The
Credit Comittee meting is confirmed by a report approved by all members.

MDA General Directorate. The MDA General Director exercises aanagemeat functions
as described in the internal rules and regulations. In addition, he has three
specific responsibilities:
-     preliminary assessment of projects and recommendation as to their
future;
-     final assessment of projects and recommendation submitted to the
Loan Committee or the Board with respect to projects exceeding TD
150,000;
-     decision with respect to loans under TD 150,000.  For projects
supported by Ministry of Interior or technical Ministries, decision
is final only after written notification of the approval of the loan
has been presented.
d.  MDA Financial PolicZ and Fiscal Status.  MDA financial policy aims at
maintaining a positive stable margin between average income from outstanding
loans and average cost of its borrowing and other resources. This margin must
allow for increasing surpluses in order to constitute appropriate loan loss
provisions. MDA management establishes yearly financial statements and submits
them for external audit before presentation to the Board and main lenders within
the first four months following the end of the fiscal year. Accounting follows
the rules applicable to commercial enterprises.
Lending operations procedures follow strict rules and regulations
approved by the Board. Lending conditions establish grace periods, limits of
loan amounts in absolute values with respect to resources of borrowers. Loans
approved by MDA must not exceed 15 years, with a two-year grace. In order to
limit lending costs, MDA should be tax exempt and its contracts and official
documents should also be exempt from stamp duty and registration fees.
B    MDA INTERNAL ORGANIZATION
The MDA General Manager, with expertise in financial matters and
project appraisal, must have 15 years' professional experience. He will set up
an efficient and balanced internal organization and recruit skilled personnel.
In the first phase, MDA should have a staff of about 15, including
the General Manager, divided in four departmentst
-     a General Secretariat;
-     a Loan Directorate, responsible for pro-appraisal and appraisal of
projects to be financed, follow-up, and approval of bids;
-     a Financial Directorate, responsible for funding, preparation of a
yearly loan program, and accounts management; and

is based on the new conditions of the proposed credit for MDA, namely (i)
rates of 6.5 percent (1993-96), and 8.5 percent (1997-2000) for 10-year
and 15-year loans, and (ii) rates of 4.0 percent (1993-96) and 6.0 percent
(1997-2000) for vehicles and equipment (7-year loans) financed under

(b)   Loan reoayment was estimated as per the table under para 1. (a)
above for new loan. plus CPSCL's estimated repayment schedule.
(c)   FCCL contributions: total FCCL funds would grow at 8.5 percent per
annum; however, FCCL allocations to the MDA is expected to grow at
an annual factor of 13 percent during the Eight Plan (1992-96) and
then at an annual factor of 8.5 percent.
(d)   Government transferst Direct transfers from the Government to MDA
expected to be at the level of TD 50 million for the Eighth Plan
(1992-96) and TD 65 million for the Ninth Plan.
(a)   Long-Term Debt: according to the borrowings under para 2. (a) above.
4.    Usesm
(a)   Loans:   the PIC is estimated at TD 425 million for some 745
projects, which is an average project size of TD 570,000. The loan
amounts shown in the Sources and Uses of Funds statements correspond
to disbursements on loans.   Disbursements on approved loans are
expected to take place over some times while some will be disbursed
quickly during, say, one year, a few bigger loans may take as long
as four years. However, it has been assumed that as disbursements
on new loans pick up speed, disbursements on old CPSCL loans will
compensate for those slow disbursements in the first few years of
operation of MDA.
(b)   Government transfers: Transfers from MDA to the municipalities
expected to be at the the level of TD 94 million for the Eighth Plan
and to grow at an annual factor of 4 percent during the Ninth Plan.
(c)   Short-Term Investments - Total sources - loans - MDA transfers to
the municipalities. It is expected that of the funds made available
to MDA in the first years of its operations, a portion will not be
allocated to loans to municipalities as the MDA builds up a
portfolio of loans and as it acquires experience.
5.    Balance Sheets
(a)   CPSCL loans at year-end 1992 have been estimated at TD 88,970,000.
This amount has been considered as the initial equity of the MDA.
(b)   Cash balances were calculated at one month of financial expenses and
one month of general expenses.

Municioalities and Municioal Development Agencv
Financial Bisk Analysis
1.    MDA and the municipal'ties would be subject to some financial risks that
can be conceptualized in relation to size and mode of operations and to
deviations from the assumptions used in assessing their financial viability.
2.    The size of operations may differ from the one that has been anticipated
as a result of delayed project implementation or decreases in the availability
of FCCL and other Government transfers to both MDA and the municipalities. Those
variations would, under ceteris paribus conditions, increase the commitment fees
on MDA's borrowings and reduce MDA's loans and would also result in a lower level
of municipal investments than anticipated.
3.    The deviations from the assumptions used in preparing financial projections
that may impair MDA's or the municipalities, financial viability ares reduced
municipal revenues as a consequence of reduced amounts of cost recovery from
investments, reduced MDA revenues resulting from charging lower loan rates than
anticipated, or higher than expected operating costs. Higher operating costs may
result, for example, from a longer start-up period of MDA operations requiring
the assistance of consultants. Deviations from the assumptions can also come
from lower government contribution to investments or lower borrowings than
anticipated, or both.
4.    To test the robustness of the financial projections and of the proposed
covenants, the projections for the period 1993-2000 were subjected to strain
under the following simulations:
Case  1:   Reduced Government direct  and  indirect transfers.    This
simulation examines MDA and the municipalities' behavior assuming that
FCCL and Government transfer amounts would increase by only one-half the
estimated amounts in the financial projections presented in the preceding
pages, or the base case.
Case 2: Reduced municipal revenues. This simulation examines the behavior
of municipal finances under the assumption of no increases in their
revenues on account of direct cost recovery (revenue on charges).
Case 3: Reduced MDA revenues vs. reduced municipal exoenditures. In this
simulation, the current average loan interest charge of about 3 percent is
maintained until 1997 when it will reach 5 percent. The impact of this
assumption on both MDA and municipal finances is reviewed.
Case 4: Hiaher oceratino costs. This simulation looks into the effects
that increases in operating costs of the municipalities (by 10 percent)
and of the MDA (by 200 percent) would have on their respective finances.
Case 5: Reduced borrowinas and lendina Proaram. This case presents the
effects of a reduction of MDA borrowings by 20 percent resulting in a
decrease of its lending program to the municipalities by 25 percent . The
impact of the changes on the financial viability of both MDA and the
municipalities are examined.

Case 6: Reduced Government transfers tcase 11 and reduced borrowinas tease
Al:   Thie case presents the simultaneous effects ofs  (a)  reduced
Government direct and indirect transfers to both MDA and the
municipalities, and (b) reduced borrowing and lending program for MDA and
thus borrowings from the municipalities. This case may be more realistic
than the base case; although it is less ambitious in terms of a municipal
investment program, it is more flnancially sound.
5.    The criteria used to evaluate the effects of the above simulations consist
of the following indicators:
For municipalities
- financing pattern (percentage of investments)
- debt service coverage ratio
- revenue on charges as percentage of expenses title I2 and investment
costs.
For MDA
- financing pattern (percentage of loans)
- debt service coverage ratio (without and with loan recovery)
- revenue and expenses on average total assets and their differential
(margin)
- net income as percentage of both average total assets and average
equity
- debt/equity ratio
I/ Title 1: recurrent expenditures including salaries, other operating costs end interest rates.

In this case, coqpared with the base case, MDA receives less Government direct and indirect transfers
(-TD 88 million - -45X) but distributes even less, in percentage, to the municipalities (-TD 84 mit lion a -47X)
and at a more advantageous pace. Therefore, its financial situation would improve over the period 1993-2000
as seen with its net income (020 percent) and its short-tenr investment (from 4.97 percent to 5.08 percent of
the total amount of the loans).  However, a differentiation has to be made before and after 1997 at which point
large-scale, short-term borrowings as high as 21 percent of loans to the municipalitfes would be necessary to
finance them if they happened to stay at the original level of TD 238 million.

This case demonstrates how  inportant  it is for the manicipalities  to continue  increasing their revenues.
Indeed, with an about TD 20 million decrease passed on their net internmly cash generation, mnicipalities
would fianc with their own resources  n even lower part of a smaller PIC (13 percent of TD 407 million) then
the base case C17 percent of TD 425 million). The debt service coverage ratio would be below the threshold of
1.3 from 1996 nd decreasing This would require a slow-down in the PIC, less borrowing and more Governnent
transfers, which in fact seems very unLikely, since they already exceed the level of 50 percent.

Thlis case clearly shows what MDA cannot afford.  Indeed, at such interest rates, net income would be negative
starting in 1995 (more than TD 7 miltion losses for the period 1993-2000) as weLt as short-term resources from
1997, which would thus become short-term borrowings for TD 7 million, as high as 22 percent of the total amount
of loans in the year 2000. The equity would not reach TO 110 million in 2000 against TD 140 million In the base
case. To compensate for such a situation, MDA would have either to lower drastically its lending program to
the municipalities or to obtain additional contributions from the Goverrment.

At first glance, the municipalities would  improve their situation because of the decline in debt service, which
would allow them to increase the r Investments by about TO 6 million over the Eighth Plan (1992-96).  But MDA's
overall poor situation, which woAld probably lead to a net reduction of its lending program, would surely lead
in return to a worsening of the municipalities' financial position.

In this case, RDA would have to deal with very low net income, even negative in 1996 and 1997. Starting In
1997, it would need short-term bL. rowings to maintain its level of loans at TD 238 million (for about 2 percent
of this amount). However, we can notice that MDA would still be able to service its debt: the debt service
coverage ratio with loan recovery being above 1.9 times on average for the whole period.

This  case  highlights  the  importance  of  operating  costs  as  related  to  the  financial  position  of  the
municipalities as well as their overall fragility in the face of unforseeable circunstances.  Indeed, this 10
percent increase would result, starting in 1994, in increasingly negative nat internally generated funds over
the Eighth Plan (TD 5 million compared with TO 71 million in the base case) and would seriously impair their
capacity to reifmburse their debt: debt service coverage ratio uider 1 from 1995 to 1998 with an average of 0.9
for the Eighth Plan (1992-96).

In this case, MDA would slightly increase its net income by TD 2 million over the period) mnd appreciably its
short-term investments to approach TD 40 million at the end of the period, which represents the capacity for
14DA to increase its lending program to the municipalities if their debt capacity will permit it. Otherwise,
all other indicators would also fare better and MDA would look stronger.

Its this case, the municipalities' net internally generated funds would increase by 12 percent over the Eighth
Plan (1992-96) compared with the base case, while the investment program would decrease by 7 percent (from TO
425 million to TD 396 mitlion). This would increase self-financing (in relative and absolute value) and the
part of Government transfers Ctmore than 50 percent of investments) if these happened to remain at the same
level. Otherwise, the debt service coverage ratio would improve.

In this case, MDA would be stronger than ever, although its size would slightly decrease (total assets would
pass from To 250 million to TO 230 million over the whole period 1993-2000), its short term investment would
Increase tremendously from TD 12 million to TD 40 mIllion over the period, representing MDA's capacity to
support a more awbitious municipal  lending program.   Otherwise, MDA would be able to  finance on its own
resources up to 52 percent of Lower loans (-25 percent in comparison with the base case) and higher short-term
investments (0240 percent), while the share of Goverrsent direct and indirect transfers and the share of long-
term debts would remain basically unchanged.

REPVBLIC OF TUNISIA
MUNICIPAL SECTOR ZIUVE8TlNT PROJECT
I   PROJECT PREPARATIOW PROCFDURES mNnnT;
A. Sumarv of Procedurez
There are two steps in loan processingt
- the municipality prepares a preliminary document which is then
examined by RDA. During this first stage comes the agreement in
principle on the award of the loan;
- the municipality prepares a detailed document, with possible
external support; the document is assessed by NDA and results in
a loan contract.
Disbursements are made for expenses incurred and are monitored by
NDA. Loan repayment is handled by NDA. This procedure is summarized in the
table hereunder and involves eight steps as follows:
S. Procedures steos
a)          Prenaration of Preliminary Loan DoSument
The preliminary document is prepared by the sunicipality and
presented to MDA. The documents contains
- a loan request letter endorsed by the Municipal Council;
- a technical document comprising a brief note of project
presentation and justification (study of requirements), a summary
estimate of project costs, a draft financing plan (own funds,
loan, subsidie-..) succinct graphic documents (e.g., layout, site
plan); and potential environmental issues; and
- the municipality's financial data for the last three fiscal years.
b)          Analysis of the Proliminary Loan Document
The document is analyzed by the MDA Appraisal Section which
- verifies that project ls in conformity with eligibility criteria;
- examines the size of the project with respect to municipality's
needs and financial viability;



- 83 -
ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 20
- makes recommendations to the Director as to the amount and
possible modifications to the project; and
makes sure that an agreement on transfers exists in principals.
On the basis of these recommendations, the Director makes a decision
as to the amount and defines the type of detailed documents to be presented for
the next step of the procedures
- for small projects: detailed preliminary design with estimates;
- for average-size projects: detailed preliminary design with cost
effectiveness comparison between two alternatives;
- for large projects:   detailed preliminary design with cost
effectiveness comparison among three alternatives;
- for slaughterhouses, solid waste management and sewerage projects:
environmental impact assessment studies.
MDA may assist the municipality in preparing terms of reference for
the studies. This may entail prefinancing a contract with a consulting firm1
co          Detailed Loan Locument orenaration
The document is prepared by the municipality with possible external
support. In this case, the municipality signs a contract with a consulting firs
and request MDA the disbursement of funding the studies. When the document is
completed, it is presented to NDA. The detailed document includes:
- a technical document; and
- a financial document.
d)          Proiect annm isal
The project is technically, economically and financially assessed by
the MDA Appraisal Division2. The assessment verifies whethers
- size of the project is compatible with the needs to be met;
- technical modalities are relevant;
- management and execution modalities are satisfactory;
1. A fund for prefinancing project studies has been created in MDA. It may finance detailed execution
studies and Is granted without interest.
2* The Appraisal Division includes financial and technical capacities, which allows for an assessment that
closely integrates all technical, adminfstrative, economic, and financial aspects of the project.



- 84 -
ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 20
- financial results of the project are acceptable;
- financial capacities of municipality are compatible with
expenditures involved;
- economic results of the project are positive; and
- environmotal issues properly dealt with;
When the assessment is completed, the Assessment Division proposes
its recommendations to the MDA Director who makes the decision on loans not
exceeding TD 150,000 and to the Loan Committee for loans exceeding
TD 150,000.
e)          Loan Aareement
The municipality is informed of the loan decision by letter
specifying the subprojects retained in conjunction with the financing, and
possible further recommendations.   The decision is then followed by the
preparation of a loan document, including disbursement calendar, effectiveness,
and other conditions.
The loan document is signed by the NDA Director and the Municipality
Mayor. This loan document:
- sets up parameters for the credit operation;
- indicates the conditions for funds release; and
- indicates annual repayment schedule and yearly amounts.
f)          Invitation to bid
After the loan is signed, the municipality prepares the execution
documents with eventual external support. Competitive bidding is launched by the
sunicipality,  after consulting with MDA.   The municipality  examines the
submissions and awards the bid.
g)          Lo  Disbursewo
The first disbursement request is made by the municipality and takes
place at the start-up of the works. MDA ensures that the bid conforms with the
purpose of the loan and the legal stipulations.
The first tranche is disbursed according to the planned schedule and
can represent expenditures corresponding to 30 percent of the contract. In case
of a very short implementation period, the loan can be disbursed in one tranche.



- 85 -
ANNEX 7
Page 4 of 20
Tranches are disbursed upon request from the municipality, after
supporting documentation related to work progress, settled accounts, and accounts
to be settled has been presented to NDA.
h)          loan Renaument
NDA sends the maturity notice and handles the municipality's
accounts.   The following Table summarises the first eight phases of the
proceduAre.

II  XVALUATION CRITERIA
Project approval is based on the following general criteria:
- projects should correspond to effective demand and municipality
priorities;
- projects should select solution presenting optimal cost-
effectiveness and economic justification;
- economic rate of return should be demonstrated (over 12%) for
p7:ojects generating quantifiable revenues and with total cost over
US$l million;
- internal rate of return should be computed for productive
facilities with total cost over US$l million (over 12%);
- environmental impact taken care of;
- cost recovery from beneficiaries should be ensured for investamnts
generating resources; and
- borrower should demonstrate sound financial viability, managerial
performance, and maintenance of investments or take necessary
measures to improve these areas (strengthening of own resources
or subcontracting to a concessionary company).
These general criteria are developed for each type of investsent
described hereunder, as well as specific criteria which might apply.
A. Noiobborhoods to be rehabilitated
Al. Criteria
a)          Two kinds of criteria are applied to all neighborhoods to be
rehabilitated.
(i)   Exclusion criteria
Kinimum rate of occupancys   100 inhabitants per net hectare,
excluding the right of way reserved for primary infrastructure and
common infrastructure (those which are not reserved for the
neighborhoods' population such as secondary schools, hospitals, city
halls); this criterion would, if the case arises, be replaced by two
ratios: density of households per net hectare (>18) and density of
housLug per net hectare (>15);



- 88 -
ANNEX 7
Page 7 of 20
Number of demolitions with relocation and compensation below 5
percent of housing, in conjunction with the restructuring of the
neighborhood;
Part of priaary infrastructure to be supported by operatimg expenses
under 30 percent of the total expenditures of the municipal
infrastructure.
(ii)  Elioibilitv criteria
Infrastructure costs, including physical and price contingencies, as
well as the costs of studies, and services by the implementing
agency on behalf the municipalities, will be less than 3,000 TD per
lot, which will detersine the level of infrastructure to be
executed;
Secondary infrastructure expenditures calculated on the basis of
reimbursement conditions of CPSCL loans to the municipalities will
not exceed the equivalent of 5 percent of the beneficiary residents'
average income, with the understanding that the municipality will,
if the case arises, decide to charge those expenditures by adjusting
then among the unpopulated lots, individual housing, and collective
housing; and
The amount of expenditures to be supported by t1-   nicipality will
be compatible with its investment capacity, and the loan amount
compatible with its lcan capacity.
b)          In addition, the selection criteria below will be applied to more
densely populated neighborhoods that can benefit from exceptional subsidies of
up to 70 percent of the cost:
(i)   size of the neighborhoods to be rehabilitated > 200 housings or
1,200 residents; and
(ii)  net density per hectare > 20 housing units; and
(iii) infrastructure costs below 2,500 TD per lot.
A2. Asoects to be considered for criteria set up
(i)   Physicial aspectst
neighborhood access'saility: conditions and practicability of access,
conditions of feeder roads in varioets networks;
existing infrastructure on site: internal roads (development and
layout), rain and wastewater drainage, receptacle and collection of
domestic waste, electricity and public lighting;



- 89 -
ANNEX 7
Page 8 of 20
percentage of servicing connection;
size of neighborhoods, conditions of constructed buildings, and
occupation rate par housing (neighborhood population/number of
housings);
(ii)  Socic-economic aspects:
Land status: percentage of building owners, land owners with and
without titles, percentage of bare lots owned by individuals and by
the state;
neighborhood  dynamism:   percentage  of  housing  units  being
built/percentage of undeveloped areas; and
urban growth dynamism: population of squatter areas/municipality
population, municipality growth rate compared with national urban
growth rate.
S. Xstablishment of Urban Roads and Drainaae
a)          Proe-creenina of Suboroiects
(i)      Unaradina Works should be related to the most downgraded roads,
those with heavy traffic needing a reinforced pavement, and unpaved
roads lined with houses on at least 20% of its length; in case of
displacement, the resettlement should be included in the subproject;
and
(ii)      The proposed road(s) should be marked on a suitable sap of the area,
showing whether sanitation and water distribution networks exist or
works to be executed within the next five years.
b)    Prolect Dexi-m
(i)      Engineering standards (regarding size of roads, thickness of layers,
materials) should be adapted to the class of road proposed; right-
of-way should be limited, respectively to 15 m for access roads, 9
a for feeder roads, and 6 a for tertiary streets;
(4i)      Safety measures (trafflc light, signs, equipment for cross-section
roads, pedestrian crossings) should be part of the design;
(iLL)      DraLiage systems should be included in the study; and
(iv)      Cost estimates for subprojects should be based on unit prices
obtained from recent contracts.

Page 9 of 20
c)          Prooet Justiflcat
For roads to be rehabilitated, justification criteria can be limited
to the observatLon of the site conditions. ConcernLng the upgrading of existing
urban roads, justLficatLon wil. includeg
(i)     Existing volume of average daily traffic by type of vehicle should
be measured and estimates produced for traffic after project
implementation;
(ii)     Estimate of transport cost savings per unit of present traffic
(passengers and merchandise) should be provldedt
(LiL)     PreliLmnary estimates of other benefits that say accrue from the
proposed subproject (such as increase in land value) should be
produced, as well as other social address indicators such as average
distance to educational, health, or administrative facilities;
(Iv)     For subprojects costing over US$1 milLon, the methodology of
project preparation and analysis should be justified; the economic
rate of returns should be acceptable in regard to the cost of
capital; and
(v)     measures should be taken within the subproject in order to insure
maintenance.
d)          Road Maintenance
An appropriate maintenance program should be implemented in
accordance with specific plans. Agreement should clearly assign responsibilities
of various parties (Regional Departaent of the Ministry of Equipment, Technical
Department of the Local Government) to insure maintenance, involving contracts
with private companies to implement maintenance works.  Funds allocated for
maLntenarce could be expressed with regards to partieular type of roads in terms
of absolute amount allotted per km and p.a., or in terms of physical description
of maintenance equipment such as patching units, road-rollers, loaders, aotor-
graders, trucks, and spreaders.
e)          Cost Recove
Cost recovery procedures should be established. For neighborhood
upgrading, cost recovery will be done Lidirectly through a tax increase spread
over a 20-year period, since the forms of quantifiabl- goals will be considered
in conjunction with the local tax reform.

C. Beverage asd solid waste
Cl.  Sewerae and Waste Water Dasgosal
a)          Pre-screenina of subproisets
(i)      The sewerage subproject would cover a site outside the purview of
ONAS;
(ii)      The condition of the existing sewerage facilities, the estimates per
capital and total water consumption, the number of water and
sewerage connections in previous years, and the quality of services
should be taken into account in conjunction with the study;
(iii)      The proposed network should be marked on a suitable map of the area,
showing that water distribution is existing or should be undertaken
by SONEDE at the same time; and
(iv)      New sewer connections should constitute a well-organized network,
linke(, to existing network, a semi-autonomous waste water disposal,
or a technically affordable system.
b)          Project Desian
(i)      Engineering standards should be adapted to the proposed system;
feasible alternatives to provide the project area with sewerage, and
ways of improving and expanding the existing sewerage system should
be discussed;
(ii)      Cost estimates of the selected alternatives and economic comparison
of these alternatives should result in the selection of the proposed
scheme, preparation of detailed cost estimates, and programming of
the proposed scheme.
C)          Prolect Justification
(i)      For a treatment plant costing over US$1 million, a financial
analysis should be included, taking into account the marginal cost
of sewerage expressed as a cost per cubic meter of liquid waste to
be treated or re-used, including the cost of operation and
maLntenance;
(ii)      Satisfactory  arrangements  ensuring  good  execution,   project
supervision, and efficient operation and maintenance system should
be addressed, $ncluding the seasures taken to meet the needs
(involvement of the private sector or other Agencies, or staffing,
recruitment, and traLinng of technical departments);

ANNEX 7
Page 11 of 20
(iii)      To forecast future water consumption, numbers of water and sewerage
connections over a 10-year period and the percentage of population
served per house connection should be assessed; and
(iv)      The  economic  rate  of return  should  include  an  environmental
assessment and social indicators such as health improvement.
d)          Cost Recovery
See above para *   (e):  Urban roads and drainago; in addition, the
cost of individual connection will be recovered directly from the boneficiairies
over a maximum period of 5 years.
C2. Solid Waste Disoosal
a)          Pre-Screenina of Suboroiects
(i)      The proposed location of solid waste (SW) disposal ATZ an existing
public sanitary landfill to be improved, a new site to be developed,
or a recycling plant to be built should be marked on a suitable map
of the area;
(ii)      The capacity of the SW disposal should be related to the volume of
SW collection, the nature and quality of households refuse, or other
sources (industry, tourism, construction); and
(iii)      The report should  include a diagnosis of the weaknesses and
requiraments of the existing sanitary landfill with a view to
improving its administrative, technical, and financial management;

RBPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
iiUICIMPAL SECTOR IUVBSMUNT PROJS-
III  NVXRONEMNTMI ASPECTS
A. Environmental Problems in the Proiect Cities and Municinalities
1.          Many sunicipalities in Tunisia are faced with adverse eavironmental
conditions resulting from, among otherst (a) uncollected garbage and open dumping
and burning of solid waste; (b) unsanitary public markets and slaughterhouses;
(c) dumping of animal waste from slaughterhouses into waterways; (d) inadequate
sanitation and dumping of sewage into waterways; and (a) lack of proper drainage,
causing stagnant water, and flooding.
2.          These conditions have been brought about mainly through high national
population growth, rising urbanization, and a lack of commensurate investment in
basic infrastructure and municipal services. Rural life styles, such as the
dumping of garbage and human waste in open waterways, are no longer acceptable
in the cities with their higher population densities.
3.          Existing infrastructure facilities are inadequate to meet the demand
for services from the ever-increasing urban population. The capacity for service
delivery has been further diminished because many of the systems are old and
dilapidated and are unable to operate at peak efficiency. The increase in demand
for services has also outpaced the ability of the national and especially local
governments to provide additional capacity. The result is that levels of service
are deteriorating and problems relating to environmental pollution and public
health are increasing.
S.  Incorooration of Environmental Concerns in the Proiect Desiam
4.          The MSXP comprises a large number of small-scale infrastructure
engineering and municipal service components in a wide range of cities and
sunicipalities throughout the country. It offers a good opportunity to local
governments to make a significant impact in improving environmental protection.
The problems in the areas of public health, sanitation, drainage and solid waste
managesent, are all within the scope of the proposed project. Other aspects of
environmental protection such as noise control and atmospheric pollution are
beyond the scope of MSIP, although a minor impact in these areas may be achieved
through improved traffic management procedures.
S.          Environmental concerns would be taken into consideration in the
forsulation of investment programs  under the project.   As part of project
preparation, the local governments would under the guidance of MDA and ANPEt
(a)   undertake a careful assessment of the possible environmental impact
of each project component. This should include an evaluation of the
effects and actions that one sector may have on another.   For
example, improved drainage may not be fully effective if solid waste



- 100 -
ANNEX 7
Page 19 of 20
collection is neglected, and road rehabilitation-may have a limited
life if the area is subjected to frequent flooding due to inadequate
drainage;
(b)   give eareful consideration to the location and site selection
criteria for high-risk facilities with the potential for causing
pollution.    These  include  solid  waste  disposal  sitos  and
slaughterhouses;
c)   provide alternativa sites and adequate compensation to squatters and
other residents displaced through the project;
(d)   obtain  locational  and design  clearances  from the  responsible
regulatory agencies, such as ANPE, for facilities such as landfills
and slaughterhouses;
(a)   ensure that the project design includes adequate and effective
safeguards to  litigate pollution problems;
(f)   develop, introduce, and monitor operational and management plans for
facilities such as markets, slaughterhouses, and solid waste
disposal sites to ensure that pollution and environmental damage do
not coccur as a result of day-to-day activities; and
(g) introduce a system of regular and routine maintenance to keep
facilities  in good operating condition.   This  would  include
activities such as drain cleaning and septic tank emptying.
NDA would require the submission of an environmental assessment and its approval
by ANPJ as an eligibility criterion of the investment proposals submitted by the
local governments during the appraisal of the subprojects.
6.          Public sarkets and paving/rehabilitation of urban roads are expected
to account for a large part of the investments under the project. The emphaAis
will be on the rehabilitation of dilapidated public market facilities and
atteution will be given to providing: water supply for wet sections (fish and
meat); drainage, refuse collection, storage, and removal; public toilets; and
traffic management.
7.          Landfill site and slaughterhouse investments have the largest
potential for causing pollution and other negative impacts on the environment.
The landfills and slaughterhouses will be designed to mitigate pollution, e.g.,
slaughterhouse designs will include facilities for the treatment and disposal of
waste products and animals condemned as unfit for human consumption.  Proper
sanitary landfill methods of operation will be introduced and facilities designed
accordingly; site drainage, fencing to control wind-blown litter and for
security, and leachate control ;ystems will be provided. Detailed operatirnal
and management plans will be prepared for each landfill site showing the sequence
of tipping, compacting and covering of cells. The provision of suitable material
for covering and capping will be included in the operational plan.
S.          To the extent that the environmental problems reflect weaknesses in
the system in place in the country as a whole, system-wide solutions would need
to be sought. First, although local and national governments are beginning to



- 101 -
Page 20 of 20
take a greater interest in the environmental impact of investment projects, the
procedures to conduct a full environmental impact assessment are not necessarily
in place.  MDA with the help of ARRU and ANPE would develop environmental
assessmect guidelines to be used in the review of subprojocts in collaboration
with ANPE: and the Bank based on the Bank's Environmental Assessment sourcebook.
This would be carried out through a series of workshops for which the involvement
of staff from EDT7  would be sought.  Staff from the ANPE are expected to
participate in these workshops. These guidelines would also provide a basis for
local governments to conduct environmental assessments of their own investments
and would be part of the environment training under the Municipal Training
Program.
9.          The prevalence of open dumping reflects the fact that sanitary
landfil i techniques and practices ire not well known in Tunis$a. There is a
severe thorta,e of skilled designers, managers, and operators able to effectively
introduce this system, particularly in the provincial areas.  A sub3tantial
training prograsm in the planning, design, construc+Ion, and operation of sanitary
landfills is therefore urgently required.
C. The Environmental IXoact of the Proiect
10.         Given the above provisions, the project is expected to have a
positive environmental impact. There are significant health benefits to having
clean and sanitary conditions at public markets and slaughterhouses for the
preparation, handling, storage, and display of food for human consumption,
particularly fish and meat.  Slaughter-house improvements financed under the
project would provide humane and sanitary facilities for the slaughter of animals
for human consumption, reduce the incidence of illegal and backyard slaughtering,
and enhance public health standards through more rigorous meat inspection and
safer preparation, handling and storage practices. Improvements in flood control
and drainage systems funded under the project should reduce flooding, damage to
private property and infrastructure, and disruption to economic activities and
social life.  And, the proper disposal methods allowed by project-financed
landfill investments should result in reduced air pollution fr m burning and
possible contamination of groundwater.
