                         The Project objectives are to reduce land-based pollution along the Cixi coast and the East China Sea, promote the replication of innovative low cost wastewater
                         treatment techniques, and encourage coastal zone conservation.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project development objectives appear to be achievable, but more monitoring results are needed to confirm preliminary findings. The project has constructed a world class
                         wetland area to provide tertiary treatment for two wastewater treatment plants. The wetland area has reduced successfully reduced total phosphorous by about 50% of the total. With
                         regard to nitrogen removal, the original target of removing 175 tons per year cannot be met because the quality of the Sanba River has improved dramatically since appraisal.
                         However, in percentage terms, the wetlands appear to bemeeting their goal of removing 30% of the total tonnage. These positive preliminary results demonstrate a replicable low
                         cost wastewater treatment technique. In terms of encouraging coastal zone conservation, the new wetlands have visibly improved biodiversity and attracted a large number of

                         enhancing biodiversity, the area has recently been designated as a National Wetland Park by the State Council. The only concern at this point is that land reclamation in adjoining
                         municipalities is creating sedimentation in the natural wetlands which could jeopardize project outcome unless urgent action is taken. The Development and Reform Commission and
                         the Hongzhou Bay New Zone (HBNZ) have expressed their willingness to implement the recommendations of a recent engineering report (“The Hybrid Option?) to address the
