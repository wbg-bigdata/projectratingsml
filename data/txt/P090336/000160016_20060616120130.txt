A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

Country and sector issues
East Asia's rapideconomic growth has beenaccompaniedby significant environmental
degradation. Land-based pollution of the region's coasts, estuaries andrivers i s one of its most
severe environmental problems and i s degrading the region's large marine ecosystems (LMEs).
To help littoral states address this problem, the GEFandWorld Bank have agreedto establisha
Partnership Investment Fundfor Pollution Reduction inthe Large MarineEcosystems of East
Asia (the Fund).The objective of the Fundi s to reduceland-basedpollution discharges that have
an impact on the seas of EastAsia by leveraging investments inpollution reduction through the
removal of technical, institutional, and financial barriers. Inparticular, the Fundwill finance
activities relatedto World Bank pollutionreduction investment projects that are ininnovative
and can be replicated inother areas. Expectedoutcomes of the Fundwould be increased
investment in activities that reduce land-basedpollution and the replicationof cost-effective
pollutionreduction technologies and techniques demonstratedby the Fund. A Brief on the Fund
(Tranche 1of 3 Tranches) inthe amount of US$25 million was approvedby the GEFCouncilin
November 2005.
The activities under this GEF-financed project were originally conceived as part of the IBRD-
financed Ningbo Water and Environment Project (NWEP). The NWEPproject was approvedby
the World Bank BoardinFY05, and this associatedGEFproject will be the first project financed
under the Fund.NWEPhas three components: i)NingboWater Supply (US$157.9 million); ii)
Cixi Wastewater (US$128.0 million); and iii)InstitutionalDevelopment (US$4.5 million). This
GEFproject is anenvironmental enhancementto the Cixicomponent of NWEP.Cixi City covers
an area of 1,100 km2,with a population of around 1million, and i s located on the northern
coastline of NingboMunicipality bordering HangzhouBay. The proposed GEFproject i s
designedto demonstrate simple andeffective wastewatertreatment methods -constructed
wetlands - and sustainable wetland managementapproaches.
The rapideconomic andpopulation growth inNingbo, as well as many other coastal cities in
China, i s increasingpollution from cities into neighboring seas. Inaddition, non-point source
pollutionfrom urban and agricultural run-off is a large and growing problem, and a significant
contributor to marine pollution inChina. Consequently, the coastline of Ningbo andits
neighboring East China Sea are severely polluted. As reportedinthe 2004 Environmental
Quality Report on Near-Shore OceanAreas of China, the East China Sea i s the worst polluted
sea inChina, and its major pollutants are nitrogen compounds and phosphates.
Inappropriate wastewater treatment technology has further aggravatedcoastal pollution situation
inNingbo, as well as inChinaingeneral.Wastewater treatment facilities inChinaareinmany
cases designedwith advancedtechnologies with insufficient consideration of financial or
operational implications. The advancedtreatment units may subsequently not be efficiently
utilizeddue to budget constraints or lack of technical expertise. An Annual Audit Report
releasedby the National Auditing Office of China (CANO) reportedthat in2004,60 out of 78
audited wastewater treatment facilities were under-utilized due to lack of operating funds or
delay of the construction of auxiliary facilities, such as wastewater collection systems. Non-point
water pollutioncontrol inChina i s still inits infancy, as the country i s focusing first on the
control of point sources, such as dischargesfrom cities andlarge industries.


                                                   1

Inadditionto coastalpollution, lossof coastalwetlands is anotherchallenge facedbyNingbo, as
well as inChina. China has the forth largest wetland area inthe world with 650,000 km2,or 10
percent of the world total. However, landreclamation, aquaculture and environmental pollution
as a result of rapid population growth andeconomic development have causedserious loss and
degradation of China's wetlands. It is estimatedthat over half of the country's coastal wetlands
have been lost. Borderingto the northto HangzhouBay, Ningbo Municipality has acoast line of
788 km and about 1000km2of inter-tidal mudflat andmarshes. These inter-tidal mudflat and
marshes and their neighboring estuary waters are important natural habitats for fishes, benthos,
migratory and indigenous water birds, and wetland vegetation. Nevertheless, it i s reportedthat
large-scale landreclamation inNingbo has ledto the loss of 46% of its coastal wetland areas. In
addition, aquaculture activities (including snails, crabs, and fish) incoastal wetlands have
inevitably eliminatednatural habitat for wetland flora and fauna.
China has implemented extensive national regulations regarding the preservation of marine
environment and wetland. The Marine Environmental Protection Law of People's Republic of
China (1999)regulates the conservation of coastal areas and protection of marine ecosystems
from land-basedpollution. As amember of the GEF/UNDP/IMO Partnership inEnvironmental
Management for the Seas of East Asia (PEMSEA), China i s endeavoredto promote integrated
coastal management to reducethe degradation of coastal ecosystem. As a signatory party of the
Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, China i s implementing its National Engineering Planfor
Wetland Conservation (2004-2030) to conserve90% of its natural wetlands, to restore 140,000
km2of wetland area, andto develop legal andpolicy measuresto more effectivelymanagethese
areas. Coastal wetlands at HangzhouBay have been classified as one of the eight nationally
significant wetland areas underthe National Engineering Planfor Wetland Conservation (2004-
2030). It is foreseeable that this GEF project will become an integralpart of China's efforts in
reducing land-based pollutionto East Asia's L M E s and inrestoring the country's important
wetland areas.

Rationalefor Bankinvolvement

Land-basedpollution reduction is akey priority of the Bank inits investment, policy and
capacity buildingactivities inthe East Asia and Pacific Region. The objectives of the proposed
GEFproject reflect this priority, andare inconsistent with the WorldBank's corporate and
regional environment strategies. The Bank is already making a significant contribution to Cixi's
sustainable development by financing the wastewater infrastructure investments under the
NWEP.Through this proposedGEFproject, the Bankcan further enhancethese investments by
supporting Cixi's efforts to manageits coastalresources and adopt simple and ecologically
friendly wastewater treatment methods. Inparticular, the Bank, via its access to the Fundcan
assist Cixi design and implement an innovative project which will serve as a demonstration
model for other coastal cities inChina andEast Asia.

ProjectDescription:

The project i s a companion to the Ningbo Water andEnvironment Project (NWEP), an IBRD
financed water supply and wastewater infrastructure project approved by the World Bankin
2005. Under NWEP, Cixi City Government will invest $128 million inthe provision of
wastewater collection andtreatment services inthe city, includingfor the construction of two
wastewater treatment plants. The GEF-NWEP(Components 1- 3 below) forms an integral part
of Cixi's wastewater project as it provides improvedwastewater treatment through a constructed
wetland and the preservation of enhancedwetlands for non-point sourcepollutiontreatment.

Component1:ConstructedWetland(US$7.12million).The GEFproject will supportthe
establishment of a wetland which will provide tertiary treatment for the new 100,000 m3/dNorth
Cixi secondary wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) financed by NWEP. The Cixi City
Government has allocated 86 ha of recently reclaimed landfor the constructed wetland
associatedwith NorthWWTP. The proposedconstructed wetland will be a combination of
vegetated submerged gravel bed andfree surface water wetland.
Component2: EstablishmentofaWetlandCenter (US$S.O million).The Cixi City
Government has designated an existing area inthe vicinity of the Ningbo-Shanghai Bridge as the
Wetland Center. The Wetland Center covers an area of approximately 43.5 km2andincludes the
following plots (see IBRDMap 34441): i)Plot Al-recently reclaimed, non-tidal landwithin the
existing sea dike (4.3 km2);ii)Plot A3-tidal marshlandto the west of Plot A1 (1.4 km2);iii)Plot
A5- alow lying islandto the north of Plot A3 (1.8 km2);and iv) the tidal mudflathay section
adjacent to Plots Al, A3, and A5, andcovering approximately 36 km2.Plots A2 and A4 would
remain agricultural or low-density buffer areas. Development of the Wetland Center consistsof
two activities: i)the construction of a visitor center for wetland education andresearch, and ii)
the enhancement and restoration of the Wetland Center's natural wetland area. The Wetland
Center has three objectives: i)enhancethe ecological functions of the area; ii)serve as an
educational and researchcenter for wetland management; and iii)improve water quality in
surrounding canals by natural wetland treatment.
Component3: DesignandManagementAssistance (US$2.0 million).The GEFproject will
finance the following three activities: i)engineering design of the ConstructedWetland andthe
Wetland Center; ii)Management Assistancefor the Wetland Center; and iii)Trainingand
Dissemination of Project experience. Management assistance i s expected to be providedby a
consortium of NGOsAJniversities.

Lessonslearnedand reflectedinthe projectdesign
The project design draws uponthe Bank's considerable experience inworking with China on
environmental issues, includingthose relatedto wastewater treatment and wetland conservation.
The Bank has beenworking closely with China on the implementation of other GEFprojects and
lessonslearnedinthese projects have beentaken into account indesigning this project. Specific
lessonsinclude:
SimplifyWastewater Treatment: Chinahas stringent effluent standardsfor treatmentplants
discharging into environmentally sensitive receiving water bodies, such as HangzhouBay. Inan
effort to meet these standards, wastewater companies often select technologically sophisticated



                                                  4

treatment processeswhich are complex andexpensive to operate. Consequently, many
wastewater treatment plants inChina do not perform as originally intended due to lack of
operating funds and expertise.The GEFproject will take advantage of the abundant reclaimed
landin Cixi to develop a constructedwetland for tertiary treatment for the North Cixi plant.
Although the constructed wetland has higher initial capital costs than conventional tertiary
treatment (chemical coagulation followed by filtration) it has lower operational costs and is a
simple and robust treatment method.
Consider Ecological Dimensionsof UrbanDevelopment: Chinese cities are growing rapidly
and transforming agricultural or undevelopedlandinto industrial, residential, andcommercial
areas. Inthe course of this transformation, it is also important to consider environmental and
ecological amenities to enhancethe quality of life and support the eco-system. The Cixi City
Government has taken the boldmove under the GEFproject of reserving significant amounts of
landfor boththe constructed wetland (86 ha) and the WetlandCenter (43.5 km2)to help preserve
coastal resources andprovide environmental amenities to its citizens and visitors.
Take Into Account Non-Point Source Water Pollution: Run-off from urbanareas and
agricultural landcan contain large quantities of pollution, particularly nutrients which are
contributingto massive redtides inthe East Asia Sea. Inaddition to controlling municipal and
industrial dischargers, it i s important for Chinese cities to beginto tackle non-point sources of
pollution in order to achieve ambient water quality objectives. The GEFproject will demonstrate
an innovate and ecologically friendly approachto non-point source controlby filtering water
from nearby canals through an enhancedwetland system inthe Wetland Center to improve water
quality.
Fullinvolvementoflocalstakeholders. Thedevelopment of this projecthasinvolvedawide
group of localstakeholders ingovernment as well as NGOs, and key researchinstitutes and
universities which have been working on pollution andconservation issuesinHangzhouBay.
Two stakeholder workshops were organized inJune andNovember 2005. Representativesfrom
over twenty Ningbo and Cixi agencies and over 10NGOrepresentativesand wetland researchers
were invitedfirst to develop a sustainable vision for the project andthento review the conceptual
design of the project preparedby consultants. B y fully engaging all stakeholdersinthe project
development process, the GEFproject has helped stakeholdersreach consensus on key activities
of the project. It i s foreseeable that such consensus will facilitate the successfulimplementation
of the GEFproject.

Alternatives consideredand reasons for rejection
MeetingDischarge Standards: Two alternatives were considered for the GEF/NWEPproject to
achieveeffluent discharge standards. The first alternative i s to discharge treated wastewater from
the two secondary wastewater treatment plants directly into Hangzhou Bay through an outfall.
However, this option was rejected given the large tidal variation and shallow water along the
Cixi coastline, and also does not reduce nutrient loads into the sea. Two options were considered
for tertiary treatment: i)conventional chemical/filtration process; andii)constructedwetland.
The constructed wetland option was selectedfor the North WWTP due to the availability of land,
and lower operational cost and complexity. There i s limited land available for the East WWTP
which makes the constructedwetland option more challenging. It was agreedthat GEFfunds
would not be usedfor the East WWTP, and treatment will be provided through a conventional


                                                   5

tertiary treatment system, or some combination of the two options. The selection and
implementation of the preferred approachfor the EastWWTP will be supervised by the NWEP
task team.
Wetland Center Size: Various plots of landwere consideredfor incorporation intothe Wetland
Center. The selected combination was basedon obtaining landfor different types of eco-systems
including: non-tidal wetland (inside sea dikes), tidal wetlands, tidal mudflats, and an off-shore
island. The option of includingPlots A2 andA4 (see IBRDMap 344441) into the Wetland
Center were considered andthen rejected as they have already beenpartly converted into
agricultural land. Insteadthese plots will be zoned as agricultural and low-density buffer areas
adjacent to the Wetland Center.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

Partnershiparrangements
The GEFproject i s an integral part of the Bank loanproject (i.e. NWEP) andthe first project to
be financed under the Partnership InvestmentFundfor PollutionReductioninthe Large Marine
Ecosystemsof East Asia.

Institutionalandimplementationarrangements
Ningbo Municipal GovernmentLevel: A Ningbo Water andEnvironment LeadingGroup has
beenestablishedto provide policy direction andplanningsupport for integrated water and
environmental managementthroughout Ningbo Municipality. The LeadingGroup is headedby a
Vice Mayor, includes high-level representativesfrom all relevant agencies, and provides
oversight for boththe GEFproject andNWEP.The NWEPPMOi s under Ningbo Municipal
Development andReform Commission and will also be the PMO for the GEFproject. The
NingboMunicipalFinance Bureaui s responsible for managementof the Special Account.
Cixi City GovernmentLevel: Cixi City Government has established a LeadingGroup specifically
for the GEFproject, and inparticular for the Wetland Center. The Cixi LeadingGroup i s headed
by a Vice Mayor andincludes relevant government agencies. The LeadingGroup i s supportedby
a GEFProject Expert Group which consists of nationally renowned wetland experts from
universities andtechnical representativesfrom specialized government agencies at the Cixi City
andNingbo Municipal levels. The Cixi Construction Bureau i s the primary government agency
responsible for oversight of the GEFproject andproviding any necessarycounterpart funding.
ZmplementingAgencies: The implementingagency for Component 1:Constructed Wetland will
be the Cixi Municipal SewerageCompany (CMSC) which i s also responsible for implementation
of the NWEPCixi wastewatercomponent. The Cixi government has established a "Wetland
Center Management Company" for the implementation of Components 2: Wetland Center, and
Component 3: Design and Management. The Management Company, under the oversight of the
Cixi government ,will be responsible for planning, construction, and operation of the Wetland
Center.

project implementation, and will have expertiseinecology, environmental education, andfund-
raising.

Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results
Annex 3 presents the results framework andmonitoringprogram for the GEFproject. The
primaryoutcome indicators relate to pollutionreduction, establishment of a viable Wetland
Center with highquality habitat and a strong environmental education program, and
dissemination of the GEFproject experiencedomestically andinternationally. Datacollection
and analysis will be undertakenprimarily by the NGOKJniversityConsortium, with support from
the CMSC for the constructed wetland. The terms of reference for the Consortium include a
detailed monitoring program developed in collaboration with the Bank task team to meet GEF
monitoring requirements. The Consortium is also expectedto develop an active ecological
researchprogram on Cixi coastal zone management.The PMO will ensure that the necessary
monitoring andreporting is undertaken, and the Bank supervision missions will review and
comment on the monitoringreports.

Sustainability and Replicability
BothNingbo Municipality and Cixi City are committedto the success of the GEF project andthe
associatedNWEP. The degree of importance attachedto bothprojects i s reflected inthe active
participation of high-level government officials inthe LeadingGroups. Under the NWEP,the
Ningbo PMO has been established as a permanentgovernment agency, and thus i s able to attract
qualified individuals who are offeredjob security andpromotion potential. Under the GEF
Project, the Cixi Wetland Center Management Company i s established with full funding support
from the Cixi City Government. Ningbo and Cixi have investedsignificant amounts of their own
funds inthe NWEPimplementationandpreparationof the GEFproject. The Cixi City
Government has also committed a total of 86 ha of reclaimed lands to be usedfor constructed
wetland and set aside another43.5 km2of area for the conservation of the Wetland Center.
Operational funds for the constructed wetland will be providedby CMSC which generates
revenuesthrough wastewater tariffs. Operational funds for the Wetland Center will be generated
through a variety of sources includinguser fees, grants and donations, and fundingfrom the Cixi
City government.
This project has also includedoutreach activities to disseminate experience andknowledge
learnedfrom the operation of the Wetland Center andconstructed wetland andto promote the
replication of innovative use of wetland inwastewater treatment inChina andEast Asia. The
potential for replication of GEFproject activities i s considered high. Constructed wetlands are an
attractive treatment option for both secondary and tertiary treatment, as well as non-point source
pollution treatment, in areas where landi s readily available. Wetland conservation i s now a
national policy inChina, andmany other cities and provinces inChina will be eagerto learned
from the experience of the Cixi Wetland Center.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
Economic andfinancial analyses
A formal cost-benefit analysis was not undertaken, butthe GEFproject will provide significant
economic benefits associatedwith wetland conservation including: i)helpingto maintain the
ecological health andaquacultureproductivity along the coastline by restrictingharvesting
within the WetlandCenter and thereby creating a "seed bed" for the adjacent areas; ii)providing
habitat for local andmigratory birds, andfacilitating birdwatching within the Wetland Center,
and thereby generating benefits for people who place amenity and/or existence value on healthy
birdpopulations; andiii)improvingthe quality of life inCixi City bypreserving wetland habitat
which has beenthe defining geographical feature inCixi's historicalandcultural development.
Inaddition, aproject specific analysis onGEFincremental cost analysis hasbeenpreparedand
includedin Annex 15.
The constructed wetland will be part of the CMSC's wastewater treatment plant andthus the
appropriate level of financial analysis is CMSC. Under NWEP, a comprehensive financial
analysis was undertakefor CMSC, and legal covenants were includedinthe NWEPloan
agreement which requires Cixi City to raise tariffs to a level sufficient to covering operating
costs and debt service. The Bank task team i s monitoringthe tariff increasesand financial status
of CMSC during NWEPsupervision.
Counterpart funding of the Wetland Center will be providedby the Cixi City government
through the Construction Bureau to the Wetland Center Management Company. Revenue
requirements for the operations of the Wetland Center are estimated to be around US$350,000.
The financial analysis inAnnex 9 shows that most, if not all, of the revenue requirements can be
metfrom visitor anduser fees (assuming 100,000- 200,000 visitors per year and anentrancefee
of 15-30 RMB per person), with any necessarygaps to be filled with donations andfundingfrom
the Cixi City Government. One of the first tasks of the NGOLJniversityConsortiumis to
develop a BusinessPlanfor the Wetland Center.

Technical
Thetechnical viability of the GEFproject hasbeenconfirmedby the Bank task team.
Independentinternational experts have also reviewedthe studies carried out duringproject
preparation andfurther confirmedtechnical viability of the GEFproject. Technical assistance
will be provided throughout project implementation of to ensure the success of the GEFproject
The constructedwetland for the North Cixi wastewater treatment plant will utilize an areaof 86
ha, which will provide approximately 7 days of hydraulic residencetime andi s consistent with
good international practice. The constructedwetlandwill utilize a combinationof vegetated
subsurface and surface flow designs which are standardpractice for wetland design.



                                                9

The Wetland Center contains sufficient area and diversity to betransformed into an ecologically
viable unit.The total area of 43.5 km2includes all major wetland types: non-tidal wetlands, tidal
marshes, tidal mudflat, and an off-shore island. The non-tidal wetlands in Plot A1will be
restored and enhancedusingadvancedecological engineering methods. Harvesting andother
aquaculture activities within the Wetland Center area will be prohibited andhabitat createdfor
flora andfauna. One of the first tasks for the NGOKJniversity Consortium i s to develop a
comprehensive wetland managementplanfor the Center. The Center will include an
environmental education andresearchbuilding(s) which will be designed utilizing green building
technology. The total number of visitors to the Center will be controlledand access to prime
wetland habitat will be restricted so as not to unduly disturb the wildlife.

Fiduciary
The GEFproject will use the adequatefinancial managementsystem developed under the NWEP
to provide, with reasonableassurance, accurateandtimely informationon the status of the GEF
project in the reporting format agreedwith the Bank. The GEFproject will also rely on
procurement capacity of the CMSC developedunder the NWEP.The Wetland Management
Company is a new implementing agency, andthus will receive procurement andfinancial
managementtraining from the PMO to ensure consistency with Bank requirements. The overall
riskfor procurement is considered average.

Social
The constructed wetlands under Component 1will be built on 86 ha of recently reclaimed land
which is undeveloped andunutilized, and will thus will not entail any resettlement activities or
affect livelihoodactivities. The major social impact of the GEFproject will be the restriction on
aquaculture activities inthe Wetland Center under Component 2. There are four overlapping
groups of people currently utilizingthe Wetland Center Area: (1) crab or fish farming on Plots
A3 and A5 (54 households, 168people); (2) fishingwith preset nets on mudflats (40 households,
120people); and (3) fishing with boats within the Wetland Center (50 households, 150people).
Inaddition, almost all householdsinthe two neighboring towns areinformally pickingsea
products (mainlyclam and snail) on mudflats. A resettlement action plan (RAP) meeting the
World Bank's OP/BP 4.12 has beenprepared and provides for adequate compensation and
livelihoodrestoration. The Cixi Construction Bureauwill be responsible for resettlement
activities incoordination with local government officials. The resettlement office of the Ningbo
NWEPPMO will superviseRAPimplementation. The capacity of the Cixi Construction Bureau
and the NWEPPMOi s considered adequate.

Environment
The GEFproject i s a Category B project for environmental assessmentas it i s an environmental
enhancement to the NWEP.Environmental design studies for the constructed wetland
(Component 1)andthe Wetland Center (Component 2) were conducted duringproject. The
studies provided comprehensive environmental analysis andcarried out extensive stakeholder
consultation. These studies show that the GEFproject as a whole will have a significant net
positive impact, as it will improve ambient water quality inCixi City andthe HangzhouBay, and
promote sustainable development of Cixi City of NingboMunicipality. The negative impacts
associatedwith the project are expected to be non-existent or minimal, and the impacts are


                                                 10

expected to be site specific, reversible, andeasily mitigated. Key environmental issues are
discussedin Annex 10.An Environmental Management Plan hasbeenpreparedto address
potential adverse impact associatedwith the construction andoperation of the constructed
wetland and the Wetland Center.

Inaddition to the Environmental Assessment andInvoluntaryResettlementpolicies discussedin
the proceeding section, this project also triggers another safeguardspolicy -natural habitats.
Natural Habitats. This GEFproject will help conserve, rehabilitate and create new natural
habitats along the Cixi coastline. Inparticular, the constructedwetland andWetlandCenter will
preserve, enhance or restore existing natural habitats for benthos, vegetation, andmigratory and
indigenous waterfowls. Annex 4 lists detailedhabitat enhancement, conservation and creation
activities to be carried out under the GEFproject.
Ningbo Municipality i s a repeat borrower for the Bank with a highcapacity to implement
safeguardspolicies. The ongoing Zhejiang UrbanEnvironmentalProject andNWEPhave proven
that Ningbo has developed a good understanding andexperience in implementing World Bank
safeguardspolicies.
Study Disclosure and Consultation: With the Bank's assistance, the Cixi City Government
organized two stakeholder workshops inJune andNovember 2005. The first workshop was
designedto develop a "sustainable vision" for the GEFproject. The secondworkshop was
carried out by havingkey stakeholderscomment on preliminary results of the two
aforementioned studies. Boththe Component 1and Component 2 environmental design studies
were disclosed locally andinthe Bank's InfoshopinFebruary and April 2006.
RAP Disclosure and Consultation: Duringproject preparation consultation has taken place
through field surveys and meetings with government officials andproject-affected people. These
consultations influenced the design of the RAP. The fullRAPwas disclosedinNingbo and Cixi
libraries and government websites inFebruary and April 2006. The draft RAPwas disclosed in
the World Bank Infoshop inJanuary 2006 andthe updated RAPwas disclosed inApril 2006.

               CHINA: GEFNINGBOWATER AND ENVIRONMENTPROJECT


Ningboand Its CoastalEnvironment
1.       Ningbo Municipality is located 175 kmsouth of Shanghai, borders Hangzhou Bay and
the East China Sea (See MAPIBRD34441), andis China's second-largestport. The high
suspendedsolids concentration inHangzhouBay, combined with hydrological andtidal currents,
results inoverall sediment accretion along the northern Ningbo coastline inCixi City, Ningbo
Municipality, with accretion rates onthe order of 50-100 metersper year.* Consequently, in
contrast to most situations, wetland areas are actually beingcreated inCixi due to the sediment
accretion along the coastline. Cixi thus has the unique opportunity to develop new tracts of land
while at the same time preserving its wetland area.
2.       According to Cixi City's Planfor IntegratedBeachDevelopment (1997-2010),
approximately 130km2of landwill be enclosedby sea-dikes between 2000 and 2010. The
reclaimed landwill be carefully planned and developed with a combination of agricultural and
aquaculture areas, industrialestates, coastaltourism, and wetland conservation zones. The area
outside of the sea dike is called the "beach-area" andthe width of the beach area varies
depending on the tide but can extend hundredsof meters at low tide. Both the areainside and
outside of the sea dike has rich benthosresourcesand vegetation, andprovide an excellent
habitat for migratory and indigenous water birds.Inaddition, there i s considerable aquaculturein
the near shore area (Le. just outside the seadikes) including snails, crabs, andfish.
3.       The rapidpopulation growth inNingbo, as well as many other coastal cities inChina, is
makingplanning and financing for utility services such as water and wastewater very
challenging. Investments in water supply andpollution control inthe municipality have lagged
far behindits rapideconomic development. Inaddition, non-point sourcepollution from urban
and agricultural run-off i s a large and growingproblem, and a significant contributor to marine
pollutioninChina. Inevitably, the coastline of Ningbo andits neighboringEast China Sea are
severely polluted. As reported inthe 2004 Environmental Quality Report on Near-Shore Ocean
Areas of China, the East China Sea i s the worst pollutedsea inChina and its major pollutants are
nitrogen compounds and phosphates.As of 2005, Ningbo Municipality and Chinaingeneral has
yet to identify effective means to addressland-basedpollution problems.
4.       Inappropriate wastewater treatment technology has further aggravated coastal pollution
situation inNingbo, as well as in China ingeneral. Wastewater treatment facilities inChina often
designedwith advancedtechnologies andwithout considering the financial or operational
implications. The advancedtreatment units subsequentlynot utilized due to budget constraints or
lack of technical expertise. An Annual Audit Report releasedby the NationalAuditing Office of
China (CANO) reported that in2004,60 out of 78 audited wastewater treatment facilities were
under-utilized due to lack of operating funds or delay of the construction of auxiliary facilities,
such as wastewater collection systems.



 The tides in HangzhouBay are the driving force for such coastline changes, with average tidal range varying from 1.7 to 5.3
meters, and water velocities on the order of 3 m3/salong the Cixi coast.


                                                               13

5.      Inadditionto coastalpollution, lossof coastalwetlands is anotherchallenge facedby
Ningbo and China ingeneral. China has the forth largest wetland areainthe world inwetlands
with 650,000 km2,or 10percent of the world total. However, landreclamation, aquaculture and
environmental pollution as aresult of rapidpopulation growth andeconomic development have
caused serious loss and degradationof China's wetlands, andit i s estimated that over half of the
country's coastal wetlands havebeen lost. It i s estimated that Ningbo Municipality has a coast
line of 788 kmand about 1000km2of inter-tidalmudflat andmarshes.These inter-tidal mudflat
and marshes and their neighboring estuary waters are important natural habitats for fishes,
benthos, migratory andindigenous water birds, and wetland vegetation. Nevertheless, it i s
reported that large-scale landreclamation inNingbo has led to the loss of 46% of its coastal
wetland areas. Inaddition, aquacultureactivities (including snails, crabs, and fish) incoastal
wetlands has inevitably eliminated natural habitat for wetland flora and fauna.
Cixi City andThe HangzhouBayBridge
6.      Cixi City, located northof NingboMunicipality on the shore of Hangzhou Bay, covers an
ara of 1,100 km2and has a population of around one million people and one of the most dynamic
county level economies inthe country interms of capacity andcompetitiveness. The newly
startedconstruction of Cixi-Shanghai Bridge across the HangzhouBay (the Hangzhou Bay
Bridge) i s seen by Cixi as a new opportunity to integrate Cixi into Shanghaiand Yangtze Delta
Region and therefore will further strengthenCixi's economy. Millions of visitors are expectedto
visit or stop by at Cixi andNingbo through the new Bridge to southeastcoastal area of China.
Cixi City Government has taken opportunity for further improving the city's environment,
livability and competitiveness. Inthe meantime, Cixi new city area on both sides of the Bridge
along the Bay i s beingplanned, nature conservation for wetlands inHangzhou Bay area i s being
initiated, andcontrol of water pollutioni s expectedthrough the implementation of the newly
approved NWEP. The city has set its objective to become an "environmentally and ecologically
friendly" city, and sees this as the approachto its sustainable development.
Wetland ConservationinChina
7.      Recognizing the important ecological and economic values of wetlands, the Chinese
government has promoted soundmanagement and rational utilizationof wetlands after it ratified
the Ramsar Convention on Wetlandsin 1992 and issued a China Wetland ConservationAction
Plan in 2000. The Chinese government has also begun implementation of the National
Engineering Planfor Wetland Conservation(2004-2030) which aims to conserve 90% of its
natural wetlands, restore 140,000 km2of wetland area, and develop legal and policy measuresto
more effectively managethese areas. As of 2005, China has established more than 260 wetland
nature reserveswith a total area of 160,000 km2,including 21 wetland areas listedinthe Ramsar
List of Wetlands of International Importance. Under the National Planfor Wetland Conservation
(2004-2030),coastal wetlands at Hangzhou Bay have beenclassified as one of the eight
nationally significant wetland areas. Inaddition, for all coastal wetland areas inChina, the
NationalPlan proposes to evaluate impacts of developmental activities to these wetlands, to
strengthen conservation of wildlife species andtheir habitats, to set up migratory birdresearch
andconservation stations, and to demonstrate sustainable wetland uses.
8.      As of 2005, wetland conservation inChina is heavily reliedon governmental investment,
with a focus on the establishment of nature reserves. With assistance of international
organizations, China has also implemented few wetland conservation projects since 2000 (see


                                                 14

Annex 2 for details). It is noted that, however, investment inwetland conservation inChina i s
limited, uncoordinated andunsystematic, and consequentlyis of low effi~iency.~Identifiedkey
barriers to effective conservation of wetland include: i)a lack of integration of wetland
management andbiodiversity conservation into development planning; ii)no institutional
mechanisms for multi-sectoral wetland management; iii)limitedawarenessof wetland values
and functions at all levels; iv) lack of examples of sustainabledevelopment of wetland resources
and involvement of local communities; and v) lack of technical capacity at national andlocal
levels to manage and conserve wetlands and their bi~diversity.~
ConstructedWetlandfor Wastewater Treatment
9.       Duringthe past20 years, constructed wetlands havebeenusedto helppurifywater ina
controlled manner inthe North American andEuropean countries. Inthe US, the potential for
achieving improvedwater quality while creating valuable wildlife habitat has leadto a wide use
of constructed wetlands for treating andrecyclingwastewater. While landintensive, these
systems offer an effective means of integrating wastewatertreatment and resource enhancement,
often at a cost that is competitive with conventional wastewater treatment alternatives.
10.      The concept of usingconstructed wetland for wastewater treatment was introducedinto
China inthe mid-1990s. Inparticular, aEuropean Union financed project -Biotechnological
Approach to Water Quality Improvement inTropic and Sub-tropic Areas for Reuseand
Rehabilitation of Aquatic Ecosystems (Contract # ERBIC18CT960059) -from 1996 to 1999
assistedChineseresearchinstitutes to experiment constructed wetland inwastewater treatment.
As of 2005, China hasbuilt up anumber of pilot constructed wetlands insmall scalefor
wastewater treatment. For example, the largest size of built constructed wetlandby one leading
Chinese institute is about 2,300 m2(or about 0.2 ha).5Inaddition to their pilot andexperimental
nature, these reportedcases have yet to addressecological, aesthetic and education values of
constructed wetlands.
Cixi's Response

4.       Cixi is implementing the NingboWater andEnvironment Project (NWEP), an IBRD
financed water supply and wastewater infrastructure project approved by the World Bank in
2005. UnderNWEP, Cixi City Government will invest $128 million inthe provisionof
wastewater collection andtreatment servicesinthe city, including for the construction of two
wastewater treatment plants. Inaddition, the GEF-NWEP forms an integralpart of Cixi's
wastewaterproject as it provides improved wastewater treatment through a constructed wetland
and the preservation of enhanced wetlands for non-point source pollution treatment. Annex 4
provides more details on the project.

              CHINA: GEFNINGBOWATER AND ENVIRONMENTPROJECT


Component1: Constructionof the ConstructedWetland (US$7.1 million):
1.       The GEFproject will finance a "constructed wetland" to provide tertiary treatment for the
effluent from the 100,000 m3/day North Cixi secondary wastewater treatment plants (WWTP)
financed by the NWEPinCixi City. As treatedwastewater will discharge into the inlandcanal
network andthen into the East China Sea, a high level of treatment is required to avoid
eutrophication and other water quality problems as the canals have arelatively low assimilative
capacity. The WWTP is designedto meet Class 1A discharge standards, which are essentially 10
mg/lBOD and SS, with removal of nutrients to 15mg/ltotal-nitrogen and0.5 mg/lof
phosphorus.The proposed treatment process i s a modifiedAZOprocess, with tertiary treatment.
As dischargeinto HangzhouBay through an outfallis not an economically viable option given
the large tidal variation and shallow water along the Cixi coastline, the Cixi City Government
has selectedthe use of constructed wetland as the preferred tertiary treatment option.
2.       Constructed wetlands are artificial wastewatertreatment systems, which consist of
shallow ponds or channelsthat have beenplantedwith aquatic plants, and which rely on
microbial, biological, physical, andchemical processesto treat wastewater. They typically have
impervious clay or synthetic liners, and constructed structures to control the flow direction,
liquiddetention time, andwater level. Dependingonthe type of system, they may contain an
inert porous media such as rock, gravel or sand. Constructed wetlands provide advanced
treatment to effluent from conventional wastewater treatment plants. Inparticular, the functions
of the constructed wetland will include butnot limitedto: i)meeting effluent dischargestandards
andminimizing impact on LMEs; ii)providing ecological functions such wildlife habitat,
particularly for migratory birds; iii)aesthetic values; iv) opportunities for environmental
education; v) low operational costs andease of operation and maintenance; and vi) potential to
serve as a GEFmodel for constructed wetlands. Correctly designed wetlands can treat and
remove some toxicants to lower levels than standardmethods such as activated sludge. The
effect i s primarily due to the longer hydraulic residencetime of the wetland (- 7 days vs. 4-6
hours) that allows slow bacterially-mediated reactions to reach completion. Inturn, the longer
hydraulic residencetime is due to a large area over which to spread water to be only about 60 cm
deep.
3.       The Cixi City Government has decided to allocate 86 ha of recently reclaimedlandfor
the constructed wetland associatedwith NorthWWTP. Basedon the feasibility study on the
constructed wetland completed by the South ChinaInstitute of EnvironmentalScience (SCIES)
and suggestionsprovidedby international experts, the proposedconstructed wetland will be a
combination of vegetatedsubmerged gravel bedand free surface water wetland. The vegetated
submergedgravel bedportion of the constructed wetland will be usedto accept treated
wastewater from the WWTP and improve water quality by absorption and degradation of
biologicalmembrane, microorganism and wetland plants growing on the gravels. Free surface
water portionof the constructed wetland then will be usedto further remove nitrogen from the
wastewater after the submerged gravel bedthrough denitrificationprocess (conversion of nitrates
inwastewater to nitrogen gas). Wastewater will be further purifiedthrough abiologicalfiltration



                                                  20

gravel bed section and a UV disinfection section before beingdischargedinto localinlandcanal
network, and ultimately into the HangzhouBay. The biologicalfiltration gravel bed section of
the constructed wetlandwill be similar to the submergedgravel bedsection butwith amain
function of removingphosphorous.
4.       The engineering of constructedwetland will be completely open to result in anet
ecological, environmental and landscapebenefit to the wetland system's natural functions and
values. A simple set of 3-5 mostly flat-bottomed cells of constantdepth (- 60 cm) ineach of the
two wetlands with plantingsof emergent plants i s proposed. A small (- 1-2 ha) deeper area (>2
m)ineach wetlandwouldprovide the growthof large emergentplants andgive openwater for
birdsto land andtake off.* Speciesof emergentplants that areeasy to grow andeffective in
pollutant removal will be selected. Candidate species include cattails, which are much more
efficient for providing carbon for denitrification and heavy metals removal, and bulrush, which
are better at absorbing pesticides and organics. For the removal of TSS almost any close stand of
plants will do while BOD i s also best treated with specific plants.
5.       Detailedecological engineering design of the constructed wetland will be financed under
Component 3 of the GEFproject. The NingboNWEPPMO will collaborate with the Cixi
Construction Bureau and CMSC to supervise the design andconstruction of the constructed
wetland. The CMSC will operate and maintainthe constructed wetland as an integral part of the
WWTP financed under the NWEP.
6.       The proposeddesign recognizesthat toxic ammonia insurface water wetland might
create public health concerns as highammonia concentration will deter small fish from eating
mosquito larvae, which as adults are vectors for malaria, dengue fever and others. As free surface
water wetland i s most efficient innitrate removalbutminimalinammoniaremoval, the gravel
bedfilters inthe vegetatedsubmergedgravel bedsection of the constructed is designedto nitrify
ammonia from 5-8mgL (inflow from the North WWTP to the constructed wetland) to about
2mg/L inthe gravels prior to allowingit to reach the free surface water section of the constructed
wetland. Incase that the gravel bedfilters are less effective innitrification, minor modification
of the WWTP's operation can be easily made to nitrify ammonia to the desired level. (One of
such modifications i s increase inretention time.) The transformation of ammonia to nitrate also
helpsthe constructed wetland to remove effectively nitrogen, which is the limitingnutrient for
algae growth inthe sea andneeds to be removed to protect environmental quality of East Asia's

7.       The Wetland Center will be established on a designatednatural wetland areaclose to the
new Shanghai-Ningbo Bridge (see Map IBRD 344441). Component 2 includes two activities to
be financed by the GEFproject: i)the construction of a visitor center and its auxiliary facilities
andii)the restoration andenhancementof natural wetland areas of the Wetland Center. When
the 36-km long bridge i s completed it will be the longest bridge inthe world, and will convey
millions of vehicles per year across the Hangzhou Bay. The objectives of these two activities are:




* A realisticestimateof open water at the Cixi constructed wetlands is about 10%.

   i)Toestablishaworld-classWetlandCenterintegratedwithaninternationallyrecognized
       birdwetland conservation area with the potentialfor tourism, public education, wetland
       research, and economic self-support;
   ii)Todemonstrateameansofremovingpointandnon-pointsourcepollutantsintoHangzhou
       Bay and an internationally-recognized example for other parts of the region; and
   iii)Tocreateareserveofmarinewetlandsthatwouldbeacontinuingsourceofre-population
       for the over exploited fish and shellfish along the Cixi coastline.
8.      The Wetland Center covers an area of approximately 43.5 km2and includes the following
plots (see IBRDMap 34441): i)Plot Al-recently reclaimed, non-tidal land within the existing
sea dike (4.3 km2);ii)Plot A3-tidal marshland to the west of Plot A1 (1.4 km2);iii)Plot A5- a
low lying islandto the northof Plot A3 (1.8 km2);andiv) the tidal mudflathay section adjacent
to Plots Al, A3, and A5, andcovering approximately 36 km2. Plots A2 andA4 would remain
agricultural or low-density buffer areas.
9.      The Environmental Baseline Study carried out by the Wetlands International andEDAW,
Inc. revealed that the Wetland Center, as part of Cixi coastalwetland area, has been usedas a
secondary stopover site to the Chongming Islandwetland area inShanghaifor feeding for
migratorybirdsmoving to andfrom northern breeding areas in Siberia and wintering ground to
as far as Australia. It is notedthat most migratory birds, dominated by smalland large wading
birdssuch as sandpipers, use the Chongming Islandwetland becauseof minimalhumanpresence
at the Chongming Islandwetland but ubiquitous human presenceinCixi coastal area.
10.     As of 2005, all the proposedWetland Center i s owned andmanagedby the Cixi City
Government. Inparticular, Plot A1 was usedas a wetland conservation area, Plots A3 and A5
were contracted to local farmers for crab farming, andthe beach andbay areas were contracted
to local farmers for shellfish harvest andfor fishing. Information about these farmers and
impacts of this GEFproject on these farmers' livelihood i s discussedindetails inthe
Resettlement Action Plan of the project.
11.     Basedon conceptual design of the Wetland Center completed by the Wetlands
International andEDAW Inc., the area will be developed mainly as a large enhancednatural
wetland for migratory birds.The now-farmed tidal marshareas of Plot A3 and the islandof Plot
A5 will be re-gradedto natural slopes for free tidal access, andthe few crab andfish farms there
will be closed. A physical barrier will be established along the Wetland Center perimeter to
prevent unauthorized access of humansto the marshes and mudflats to fish or collect clams and
crabs. A series of floating buoys will be placed inthe shallow offshore areato restrict boat access
to only those visiting the site for ecological purposes.
12.     Itis proposedthat about 300 ha, or 90% of the landarea, of PlotA1be ecologically
enhancedto establish fluctuating levelfreshwater wildlife birdponds and surroundings, or high
andlow tide habitat for migratory birds. All together, Plots Al, A3 A5, andthe tidal mudflats
will form an integratedecological system with birds flying to andfrom the sites at highand low
tides, and the removal of human competition from the enhancednatural wetland will provide a
better feeding ground and support more birds. Inparticular, a goal i s to establish a new wintering
population center with excellent viewing facilities for endangeredbirds, such as the black-faced
spoonbill, which i s one of the 50 rarest birdsinthe world and would attract manyinternational
birdwatchers. This endangeredspoonbill migrates up anddown the Chinacoast onits way back
andforth from Vietnam to N.Korea andJapan. By enhancing fish and shrimp populations in


                                                  22

shallow water habitat inthe Wetland Center, and especially areas near Plots A3 an A5, it i s
expectedthat this endangeredspoonbill will eventually migrate to the enhancednatural wetland.
The remaining 10%of the landarea of Plot A1 (about 33 ha at the east edge of Plot Al, will be
usedfor the Visitor Center buildings and auxiliary facilities, includingbut not limitedto a
parkingarea, avisitor automobile road, boardwalks, andbirdviewing blinds.
13.     The Wetland Center will focus onecological management andresearchof the enhanced
natural wetland, birdwatching and general education of the public, includingintroduction of
GEF,PEMSEA andthe Fund,exhibits of sustainablewetland andmarine ecosystems, andother
activities to benefit its sustainable operation. The needs of the casual visitor are primarily
educational and outdoor experience. For the birdwatchers the focus will be on the migratory
birdsespecially rare ones such as the black faced spoonbill. The WetlandCenter will have good
access from the bridge. However, access to the primebirdinghabitat will be limitedto bird
watchers. Group tours will be organized on seawalls and canals surrounding Plot A1 usingmini-
buses andtour boats, respectively.
14.     Another function of the Wetland Centeri s that its PlotsA3 and A5 will act as a nucleus
for repopulating the mudflats and marshesoutside the new seawalls. The entire coastalregioni s
heavily exploited for shallow water animals. There i s a danger that some economically valuable
species, their young stages or those of their prey will be eliminatedby over-harvesting. The
settingasideof the mudflats andmarshesaround Plots A3 and A5 will assist inprovidinga
safety valve to repopulate the over-harvestedareas to the east of the new bridge.
15.     The 300 ha of wetlands to be enhancedinPlot A1 andenhancedwill have a function of
piloting ecological engineering measuresfor removingnon-point source pollutants from the
water inthe inlandcanal systemthat will be pumpedthrough Plot Al. Water residencetimes will
be around 14days as a minimum. The water from Plot A1 will reach the inshore Hangzhou Bay
via the sea gates. Inaddition, once re-graded andwith the farmers removed, the tidal marshesin
Plots A3 andA5 will resumetheir natural pollutioncontrol functions with no further need of
maintenance.The ability of wetlands to remove nitrate will decrease the threat of eutrophication
andredtides inthe area. Inaddition, the ability of the large area of free surface wetlands to
remove heavy metals and petroleum products inPlot A1 will be of benefit to boththe birds
feeding inthe shallow marine waters but also to the people who gather and eat the shellfish east
of the new bridge.
16.     The dual use of the Wetland Center as abirdhabitat and pollutionremoving system is
fairly unique and will provide international recognition for the Cixi andNingboregions. It i s
estimatedthat annually upwards of 200,000 persons will visit the Wetland Center.
Component 3: Ecological Engineering Consultancy and Management Contract (US$2.0
million)
17.     The GEFproject will finance the following three activities under Component 3:
18.     Engineering Consultancy for the Constructed Wetland, the EnvironmentalCenter and
EnhancedNaturalWetland KJS$500,000):As the ecological engineering design of the
constructedwetland and Wetland Center components are closely related and complementary
activities, the GEFproject will finance an engineering consultancy contract for bothcomponents.
The consultant team would beresponsible for: i)detailed ecological engineering design of the
constructedwetland; ii)detailed engineering design of the environmental center buildingand its



                                                  23

auxiliary facilities; andiii)ecological enhancementdesign for Plots Al, A3 andA5. The
engineering contract will be competitively procured by a selection committee composedof Cixi
andNingbo municipal officials.

19.     Based on the feasibility study andinternational experts' comments, the ecological
engineering design of the constructedwetland will develop detailed engineering design for the
constructed wetland. The design will focus on three mainfunctions of the constructedwetland:
removingpollutantsfrom the effluent of a secondary treatment plant andtwo secondary
purposes: wildlife habitat andhuman enjoyment.

20.     For the engineering design for the Visitor Center buildings,three functions of the Visitor
Center will be emphasized: environmental education, wetland research, and birdwatching. Green
buildingdesign principles andstandards are requiredto be adoptedinthe design. Ingeneral, the
design should consider the useof recycledor recyclable materials andrenewable energy for the
construction and operation of the Center. Concepts such as renewable insulationsuch as sod or
reedroofing combined with solar panels on the south side andbird-friendly windmills can be
usedininteractive displays such as sedimentremovalby wetlands incut-away exhibits. The use
of a forested car park with permeablesurfaces will be considered and located at small distance
from the site enticing the visitors to walk from a wood to the center through a wetlands-lake
complex.

21.     The ecological engineering design for A1plot will highlighttwo functions of the area: an
undisturbed roostingsite for migratory birds at hightide when their feeding areas are inundated,
and a wetland arearemovingpollutants from the water inthe canals that will feed these
wetlands. Two kinds of pond-wetland systems will be required; the fluctuatinglarge and small
seasonalponds. Each will attract its own fauna. Water levels inthese ponds will be managedto
ensure open mudflats and shallow water for the roosting migratorybirds. Measuresto protect
migratory birds from their predatorswill also be considered in the ecological engineering design
of Plot Al. For Plots A3 and A5, the ecological engineering design will mainly concern how to
re-grade the landto approximate the natural condition of a tidal marsh.

22.     Management Assistance Contract for the Wetland Center (US$ 1,300.000): As the
Ningbo and Cixi implementation agencies have goodexpertise inproject management and
construction, but understandably do not have the ecological expertise necessary to managethe
Wetland Center, this GEFproject will fund a four-year management assistancecontract for a
consortium of NGOs, researchinstitutes and universities (the NGO Consortium) to participate in
the detailed design andmanagementof the Wetland Center. The NGOconsortium could bring
the energy andexpertise of the academic andNGOcommunities, and perhapsbringadditional
fundingandlower overall costs. The NGOConsortiumis expectedto provide technical
assistancefor the effective and adaptive management and monitoringof the Wetland Center. In
particular, the consortium will carry out research to identify appropriate management practices
that help the natural wetland evolve to a highquality habitat for international migratory birds and
for continuous repopulation of over-exploited coastal resources. The consortiumwill also
monitor how pollutionreduction of inland and coastal waters has been achieved at the enhanced
natural wetland. By organizing birdwatching, environmental education, andother activities that



                                                 24

   are beneficial to the sustainableoperation of the Wetland Center, the consortium i s expectedto
   develop a financing mechanismfor the sustainable operations of the Center after four years.

   23.     ReplicationandDissemination Activities WS$200.000): It is expected that training and
   workshops may be neededduringproject implementation as local implementation agenciesare
   relatively new to concepts andpractices relatedto constructedwetland, wetlandconservation,
   birdwatching andwetland education. As part of thePartnershipInvestment Fundfor Pollution
   Reduction inthe Large MarineEcosystemsof East Asia, this GEFproject will fundnecessary
I

   activities to promote the dissemination of knowledge andexperience learnedfrom the project
   and the replicationof innovative wastewater treatment techniques inChina andinEast Asia.
  These activities will include but not limited to organizing international and domestic workshops
 . inNingbo and participating in workshops organized by other international organizations such as
   the GEF, the Fund, andthe PEMSEA.

                             Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements
            CHINA: GEFNINGBOWATER AND ENVIRONMENTPROJECT

A. General
1.      Procurement for the proposedproject would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: ProcurementUnderIBRDLoans andIDA Credits" datedMay 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection andEmployment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" datedMay
2004, andthe provisions stipulated inthe Legal Agreement. The various items under different
expenditure categories are describedingeneralbelow. For each contract to be financed by the
Grant, the different procurement methodsor consultant selection methods, the needfor pre-
qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreedbetween the
Borrower and the Bank inthe ProcurementPlan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least
annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in
institutionalcapacity.
2.      Procurement of Works: Works procuredunder this project would include: northern
WWTP constructedwetland, environment educational center andecological restoration of
natural wetland. The procurement will be done using the ChineseModel BiddingDocuments
(MBDs).ICBis not expected.Butifthereis ICB, the Bank's StandardBiddingDocuments
(SBDs)would be used. Priorreview will berequiredwill berequiredon all civil works contracts
to ensure GEFgrant funds are utilizedin an optional manner.
3.      Procurement of Goods:The Wetland Center will require items such as vehicles,
computers, projectors, boats, etc. These will be procuredusingWorld Bank Goods procurement
procedures.For contracts less than US$lOO,OOO national shopping can be used. For contracts
greater than US$lOO,OOO NCB goods procurement will be used. Since the GEFgrant allocation
for goods i s only US$200,000, no ICB procurement of goods i s expected.
4.      Selectionof Consultants: There will be two major consultant contracts. The first
consultant contract will be for the engineering design of the constructed wetland, ecological
restoration of the Wetland Center, anddesign of the Wetland Center buildings and facilities. This
will be procuredunder the QCBS method. The secondcontract will be for assistanceinthe
design and managementof the Wetland Center. This will most likely be providedby consortia of
NGOs, universities andor researchinstitutes. Therefore these contracts couldbe procured using
QBS procedure. Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than US $300,000
equivalent per contract may be composedentirely of national consultants, inaccordance with the
provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.

B. Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement
5.      Procurement activities for Component 1:Constructed wetlands will be carried out by the
Cixi MunicipalSewerageCompany (CMSC) incollaboration with the Ningbo PMO and Cixi
Construction Bureau. Procurement activities for Components 2 and3: ecological restoration,
environment education center and the consulting services will be carried out primarily by the
Cixi Construction Bureau with Cixi Wetland Management Office as the actual implementation
agency, with direct assistancefrom NingboPMO. A professional tendering company will be the
procurement agent for the three civil works contracts, constructed wetland, ecological restoration
of the natural wetland, andthe environment education center. This tendering company i s also the



                                                  34

procurement agent for the on-going Ningbo Water andenvironment Project. The Ningbo PMO
will provide overall coordination and instruction for all procurement activities.
6.      For this GEF-financed project, the Cixi Construction Bureauhas established an office,
Cixi Wetland Office, with four staff to be responsible for the preparation of the project, This
office will be transferred to an entity with legal capacity to signcontracts. The assessment found
that the four staff have experiencewith localprocurement procedures, and capacity to coordinate
the procurement activities. With the assistancefrom the tendering company andguidancefrom
Ninbo PMO, this office has the capacity to conduct the procurement. CMSC i s implementing a
component of the Ningbo Water andEnvironment Project andthe general performance i s
satisfactory. Insidethe Ningbo PMO, the chief engineer will be responsible for the overall
coordination and overseeingof the procurement activities, who is also managing the on-going
Ningbo Water andEnvironment Project.
7.      An assessment of the capacity of the Implementing Agency to implement procurement
actions for the project has beencarried out by Zhentu Liu, senior procurement specialist of the
World Bank Office, Beijing, on March29,2006. The assessment found that the organizational
structure for implementing the project andthe staffing of the related entities are adequatefor
implementingthe project.
8.      The major risk concerning the procurement component for implementation of the project
was identifiedwhich i s the lack of experience with the World Bank projects by Cixi Wetland
Office. The corrective measureswhich have been agreedare (1)The Ningbo PMO will provide
direct guidance; and (2) A professionaltendering company will be employed as the procurement
agent.
9.      The overall riskfor procurement under the GEFproject is average.

C. ProcurementPlan
10.     The NingboPMO, at appraisal, developed aprocurementplanfor project implementation
which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan hasbeen agreedbetween the
Borrower andthe Project Team on March 29,2006 andi s available at the NingboPMO and
through the World Bank Internet Site. The Procurement Plan will be updated annually, in
agreementwith the Bank to reflect actual project implementation needs, andimprovements in
institutionalcapacity. The Procurement Plan i s providedinTable B below.

D. Frequency ofProcurement Supervision
11.     Inaddition to the priorreview supervisionto becarried out from Bankoffices, the
capacity assessment of the ImplementingAgencies has recommended procurement supervision
missions every six month to visit the field (includes special procurement supervision for post-
review/audits).

                             Annex 9: Economicand Financial Analysis
             CHINA: GEFNINGBOWATER AND ENVIRONMENTPROJECT

 1.      Economic Analysis: The GEFproject will generateconsiderable economic benefits
associatedwith wetland conservation including: i)helping to maintainthe ecological health and
aquaculture productivity along the coastline by restricting harvesting within the Wetland Center
andthereby creating a "seed bed" for the adjacent areas; ii)providinghabitat for local and
migratorybirds, and facilitating birdwatching within the Wetland Center, andthereby generating
benefits for people who place amenity and/or existence value on healthy birdpopulations; and
iii)improvingthequalityoflifeinCixiCitybypreservingwetlandhabitatwhichhasbeenthe
defining geographical feature inCixi's historical and cultural development. These benefits are
difficult to quantify andthus a formal cost-benefit analysis was not undertaken for the project.
2.      FinancialAnalysis for Component 1: Constructed Wetland: The constructed wetland
will be part of the CMSC's wastewatertreatment plant andthus the appropriate level of financial
analysis i s CMSC. Under NWEP, a comprehensivefinancial analysis was undertake for CMSC,
and legal covenants were includedinthe NWEPloan agreementwhich requires Cixi City to
raise tariffs to a level sufficient to covering operating costs and debt service. The Bank task team
i s monitoringthe tariff increasesandfinancial status of CMSC duringNWEP supervision.
Thefollowingparagraphshighlight the key CMSC financial issues.

3.       UntilApril 2004, the city government appliedwastewater chargesonly to commercial
and special use groups. However, as of May 2004, new wastewater tariffs were introduced that
apply to all customer grou s. The average wastewater tariff in Cixi i s now RMB 0.37/m3
compared to RMB 0.49/m inthe Ningbo urbancore. CMSC, incontrast to NWSC, will depend
                              P
heavily on equity contributions to fundits capital investment program. Cixi City will contribute
approximately 350 millionRME3 to CMSC, about one-third of the total project cost. An analysis
of the fiscal impact indicates that the project counterpart contributions to be allocated by the Cixi

4.      The financial projections preparedfor CMSC indicate that very significant tariff
increaseswill be requiredto enable it to operateon a financially viable basis. The average tariff
will needto be increasedby about 130% as of 2006, andthen by a further 66%, to RMB 1.43/m3,
by the beginningof 2008. The increasein2008 i s designedto fully recover NWEPoperating and
maintenancecosts and to meet debt service on the NWEPproject loans. Additional, but smaller
increasesare projectedto be required in 2010 and 2012, of 18% and 15%respectively, which
would bring the average tariff tojust under RMB2/m3.Evenwith these very large tariff
increases, debt service will place a considerable strain on CMSC, particularly over the 2010 -


                                                  38

2014period. Assuming that the requiredtariff increases are successfully implementedbeginning
in2006, the company shouldbe ableto comply with the cost recovery covenant inall years.
However, the projections indicate that CMSC might experience some difficulty inmeetingthe
debt service covenant inthose years inwhich debt service i s greatest.

5.      Changes inkey variables havebeen assessedinterms of their potential impact on the
financial position of CMSC. A one year delay inimplementingthe required tariff increases
would have the greatest adverseimpact on the company. A delay inthe implementation of the
first two increases now plannedfor the beginning of 2006 and 2008 couldconstrain CMSC's
capacity to provide its share of project counterpart funding. The estimated shortfall i s about
RMB20 million, which couldbe addressedthrough an increaseinthe city government's
contribution. The city government has agreedto meet all counterpart requirements not met by
CMSC.

6.      FinancialAnalysisfor Component2: Wetland Center:All of the counterpart funding
for the Wetland Center, which i s estimatedat around US$6.9 million, will be providedby the
Cixi City Government through the Construction Bureau. The estimated annual cost of running
the Center i s around RMB 2.8 million per year (US$350,000 year) as shown inthe table below:




7.      There will be at least three potential sources of revenue for the Center: i)
                                                                                   user fees, ii)
donations; andiii)budget transfers from the Cixi City Government. The table below identified
various scenariosfor meetingrevenue requirements:

                   Scenario                            Low              Base              High
 Number of Vistors                                   100,000           150,000          200,000

                                                 39

8.      The analysis shows that inthe base scenario, the Wetland Management Company can
meet is operational cost with a reasonablefee of 20 RMB/person (US$2.5). Inthe high scenario,
the user fee could be dropped to 15 RMB. Under the low scenario, the Cixi City government
may be required to subsidizethe operation of the Center. Fortunately, the Cixi City government
has a strong fiscal position andhas made a commitment to support the Wetland Center as
necessary.
9.      One of the first tasks of the NGOKJniversity Consortium is to develop a BusinessPlan
for the Wetland Center to more accurately estimate costs andrevenuerequirements. Inaddition,
the Consortium will include a professionalfundraiser who will solicit donations and grants from
companies and individuals to support the Wetland Center operations.

                                 Annex 10: SafeguardPolicyIssues
             CHINA: GEFNINGBOWATERAND ENVIRONMENTPROJECT

1.       The project is classified as a Category B project andthe following safeguardpolicies are
triggered: i)environmental assessment; ii)natural habitats; andiii)resettlement. Ningbo
Municipality is a repeat borrower, with experienceof a completed project (Zhejiang Multi-Cities
Project), the ongoing Zhejiang UrbanEnvironmental Project which includes four componentsin
Ningbo City, andthe ongoing NWEP.The Ningbo Municipal and Cixi City authorities have
developed a good understanding andexperienceinimplementing World Bank safeguardpolicies.

EnvironmentalAssessment(OPBP4.01)
2.       The GEFNingboProject i s an environmental enhancement to the NWEP. Two studies
were undertaken during preparationto provide comprehensiveenvironmental analysis and
project design: i)ConstructedWetland Feasibility Study; andii)Wetland Center DesignStudy.
These studies show that the GEFproject as a whole will have a significant net positive impact, as
it will improve ambient water quality inCixi City andthe HangzhouBay, and promote
sustainabledevelopment of Cixi City of NingboMunicipality.The negative impacts associated
with the project are expectedto be nonexistent or minimal, andthe impacts are expectedto be
site specific, reversible, andeasily mitigated. An Environmental Management Planhas been
preparedand outlines necessarymitigation measures, institutionalarrangements, andmonitoring
plan to avoid, minimize or otherwise compensatefor the adverse impact associatedwith the
construction and operation of the constructed wetland treatment system and the wetland center.

Component 1: Constructed Wetland Treatment System
3.       The overall wastewater managementapproachinCixi City, includingthe constructed
wetland, was reviewedinthe approved NWEPEIA.The NorthernWWTPs i s designedto meet
dischargestandardClass lA, with limits of lOmg/lBOD and SS, andremoval of nutrientsto 15
mg/ltotal-nitrogen and0.5 mg/lof phosphorus.The proposedtreatment processis amodified
A/O (anaerobic followed by aerobic) with tertiary treatment. Since the landinthe vicinity of the
plants i s recently reclaimedcoastal landwith no development and i s ownedby the Cixi City
government, there are no land acquisition requirements or resettlement issues. The constructed
wetland was therefore chosen as the preferred alternative becauseit provides robust treatment
with considerablebuffering capacity. Another objective of the constructed wetland i s to help
maintain andenhance a wetland ecological habitat as the surrounding area develops.
4.       The use of constructed wetlands for tertiary treatment was reviewedinthe approved
NWEPEIA at aconceptual level. In2006, the exact locationand size of the constructed
wetlands were decided after two rounds of broad stakeholder consultations and multiple rounds
of internal discussion within the Cixi City Government (see Map IBRD34441). A total of 86 ha
of landhavebeenassigned as the constructedwetland site to the Northern WWTP.
5.       Overall environmental impacts of the constructedwetland are expected to be positive.
The study on the ConstructedWetland was carried out by the South ChinaInstitute of
Environmental Sciences (SCIES) of the StateEnvironmental Protection Administration (SEPA).
The study has clearly defined the objective of the constructed wetland program andprepared


                                                 41

alternative constructed wetland designs without considering landrequirements. Basedon Cixi's
decision on land-related issues, the study has proposed, and the Cixi City Government has
accepted, a preferredconfiguration of wetland design and landuse, i.e. a gravel bedplusfree
surfacewetland. International wetland expertshavereviewedthe study and the preferred design
and agreedthat the proposed designcan serve the function of tertiary wastewater treatment and
achieve the targeted discharge standards. Technical assistance will be continuously provided
under the GEFproject to ensure international best practice i s followed inthe detailed design,
construction, start-up and operations andmonitoringof the constructed wetlands.

Component 2: Establishment of the Wetland Center

6.      The Cixi City Government has designatedan existingarea inthe general vicinity of the
Ningbo-Shanghai Bridge as the Wetland Center (see Map IBRD34441 for exact location and
boundary of the area). The Wetland Center would cover an area of approximately 43.5 km2and
include the following plots: i)Plot Al-recently reclaimed and within the sea dike on the border
of the lothSea Dike andto the west of the Ningbo-Shanghai Bridge (4.3 km2);ii)Plot A3-tidal
marshland to the west of Plot Al(1.4 km2);iii)Plot AS-island to the north of Plot A3 (1.8 km2);
and iv) the tidal mudflathay section adjacent to Plots Al, A3, and A5 and covering
approximately 36 km2.Plots A2 and A4 would remainagricultural or low-density buffer areas,
7.      Duringthe project preparation, astudy onthe WetlandCenter hasbeencompletedby
Wetlands International andthe EDAWInc., a UnitedStates-basedurban planningfirm. This
study i s comprised of three parts:i)investigating environmental baseline of the Cixi coastal area;
ii)designingtheWetlandCenterconceptually;andiii)developingalanduseplanforthe
Wetland Center. This study concludesthat the Wetland Center will help promote environmental
awareness, andprotect wetland andcoastalresources. Inaddition, the environmental impacts of
the Wetland Center will be expectedto be positive by preserving habitat for plants, aquatic
species, andbirds, andby educating general public on environmental protection, wetland
conservation andbirdwatching. Negative environmental impacts associated with the
construction of the visitor center andthe restoration and enhancement of the natural wetland
areas are believedminor, site specific andnone are irreversible.
8.      The proposed visitor center will be a medium-sized buildingwith aparkinglot and access
road. The parkinglot will be built insoutheast forest comer of Plot A1 of the natural wetland
area. The access roadwill be built on an existing road. The conceptual design of the visitor
center has suggestedthat international green buildingprinciplesbe followed to minimizethe
consumption of energy, water and non-recyclable materials, minimize waste generation and
discharge, and maximumthe use of recycled materials andrenewable energy. The conceptual
design of the Wetland Center is benefited from an international study tour organized during
project preparation.
9.      The study has suggestedthat eco-tourism, namely, birdwatching activities, be carried out
at the Wetland Center. The study estimates that annual visitors couldpotentiallybe around
200,000 person visits andthe maximumallowednumber of visitors should be no more 3,000 per
day. A visitor automobile roadi s suggestedto be constructedon an existingroadalong the east
boundary of Plot A1 of the natural wetland area. According to the land-use planof the natural
wetland, a number of birdwatching board walk andbirdviewing blindnext to the visitor
automobile roadwill be constructed to facilitate environmental education andbirdwatching


                                                42

activities. B y limitingthese construction activities to the east boundary of Plot Al, future
impacts related to these constructions will be minimized.

NaturalHabitats(OPBP4.04)
10.     Currently, none of the coastal area along Cixi i s designatedby national authorities as
legally defined protected areas. The objective of the GEFNingbo project i s to help conserve,
rehabilitate, enhance and create new natural habitats along the Cixi coastline. B y doing so, the
constructed wetland and the Wetland Center will preserve or enhance existing natural habitats
for benthos, vegetation, and migratory andindigenous waterfowls.
11.     The Environmental Baseline Study of the Cixi CoastalArea (as a part of the Study on
Environmental Center and Associated NaturalWetlands), carried out by the Wetland
International andthe EDAWInc., identifiedthat the ecological function of the Cixi coastal area
was secondaryhabitats for migratory birdsbefore these areas were either enclosed by the sea-
dikes or usedfor crab farming, fishingor shellfish collection. This study suggests that wetland
should be restoredor enhancedto improve habitat quality.
12.     Based on the findings of the Environmental Baseline Study andtechnical comments of
international experts, the study onnatural wetland has proposedto establish an enhancednatural
wetland for international migratory birds around the Wetland Center. Within this area, only
guided birdwatching activities will be allowed. Fishing, crab farming, shellfish collection
activities will be prohibited.
13.     The study also proposesminor land-use modifications inthe WetlandCenter to enhance
its ecological function. Inparticular, Plot A1 of the Wetland Center will have diverse resting
habitats (such as hills, deep and shallow ponds) for different types of migratory waterfowl.
Existingcrab farms inareas outside of the seawalls, namely Plots A3 and A5, will be leveled to
restore to natural condition, andthus to provide undisturbed feeding areas for waterfowls.
Consequently, these project activities are expected to greatly improve quality of natural habitat
for international migratingbirds andother species.
14.     Based on technical suggestions of international experts, the study on the constructed
wetland, carried out by SCIES, has incorporatedecological and aesthetical values into the design
of the constructed wetland. Various islands and slopes havebeen proposedfor the constructed
wetland to attract different types of migratory andindigenous waterfowl.

Involuntary Resettlement (OPBP4.12)
15.     The project does not involve any residents or permanent structures inthe constructed
wetland or the Wetland Center. All of the landi s ownedandregulated by the Cixi City
government. No landacquisition i s required. Fieldtrips by the Bank team have confirmedthat
the constructed wetland site was recently reclaimed land andno agricultural or industrial
activities exist on the sites. Therefore, no resettlement action i s neededfor the constructed
wetland component of the project. Instead, resettlement action will focus only on aquaculture
activities existing inthe Wetland Center.
16.     After the Cixi City Government designated the specific areas for the Wetland Center,
field surveys were carried out by the resettlement consultant -HehaiUniversity -inNovember
andDecember 2005 and March and April 2006. The Weltland Center would affect households in



                                                   43

two townships: Zhouxian Town and Andong Town. It i s confirmedthat all rural households
affected by the establishment of the Wetland Centerhave agricultural (with an average 2.4 muin
Zhouxian and or 3.9 mu inAndong) inaddition to their aquaculture activities inthe Wetland
Center. The establishment of the Wetland Center will not affect their use of these agricultural
lands.
17.     Cixi City has hadextensive experience incoastal zone reclamation and compensation
issues associated with the termination of temporary userights. Users of landunder the
reclamation process understandthat their landuse rights are temporary and there are long-
establishedlocal procedures for dealing with this issue. Cixi has an impressive recordin
providingadequate compensation for local farmers affected by reclamation activities. For this
GEFproject, Cixi has adaptedtheir compensationpolicies to meet the Bank's resettlement
requirements   .
18.     The project identifiedthat the households affected by the Wetland Center can be
classified into four types basedon aquaculture activities: (1)households engaging incrab or fish
farming intidal marsh, Le., aquaculturefarmers; (2) households engaging infishing with preset
nets on tidal mudflats, Le., aquaculturenetters; (3) households usingboats to fish inthe Wetland
Center, i.e., fishermen; and (4) householdsoccasionally picking sea products (mainly clam and
snail) on tidal mudflats, Le., pickers. The following table summarizes the number of households
engagedineach activity.

Note: All fishermen were also aquaculture farmers, andthere i s an overlap of 30 households
betweenaquaculture farmers andnetters.
19.     Resettlement Entitlement:Due to the common practice of landreclamation along the Cixi
Coast the use rightsof households for aquaculture activities are universallyunderstood to be
temporary and subject to government regulation. Inorder to comply with Bankpolicy, Cixi City
government agreedto compensate aquaculture farmers, fishermen, andnetters with replacement
costs for ponds, huts, gates, bamboo, nets, boats, etc. at the replacement cost. Aquaculture
farmers and fishermen are required to obtain a license to utilize the coastal area, and
approximately 80% of the households have paidtheir license fees. Households which do not
have a license canpurchaseone andreceive full replacement cost, or receive a reducedpayment
for their assets.
20.     Many rural households inthe two towns nearthe wetlandcenter have been involvedin
occasionally pickingor diggingof sea products on the entire mudflats outside of the sea dyke
(inside and outside of the Wetland Center). The Bank team andCixi officials recognize that the
pickers have access to other parts of the mudflats and the establishment of the Wetland Center
should actually improve overall productivity along the coastline. Although the pickers in these


                                                 44

towns would probably be inconvenienced,it i s not clear ifthey would not suffer an economic
loss (and could infact reap economic benefits due to increasedyield). It i s agreedthat the Cixi
government would provide an infrastructure development fund assistanceto the affected villages
of the two towns as compensationfor the inconvenience from the Wetland Center. Such
infrastructure development assistance should be providedbasedon broadconsultation with
farmers inthese villages. Participatory consultation planand methodology and the budgetfor
village infrastructure development projects are detailed inthe RAP.
21.     Zncome Restoration: All aquaculturefarmers, fishermen andnetters would be offered the
following income restoration opportunities: i)additional agriculture landwill offered for leaseto
the displaced households basedon their requests, including a 10,000RMB cashbonus from Cixi
City (Cixi City has an abundanceof available agricultural landdue the reclamation activities); ii)
free vocational training to take advantage of the booming economic development and strong
localjob market; and iii)eligibility for the local social insuranceprogram which i s usually not
available to rural households.
22.     Information Disclosure: The RAP has been disclosed locally and at the World Bank
Infoshop, and all potentially affected householdshave been surveyed andconsulted. The draft
RAPwas disclosed inthe World BankInfoshop inFebruary 2006 andthe updatedRAPwas
submitted in April 2006. The affected households would be informed would be informedagain
before the project starts at the appropriatetime, and the PMO andTownship government would
support the affected farmers inreceiving their entitlements.
23.     Zmplernentationand Monitoring:The Cixi Construction Bureau will be responsible for
fundingresettlement activities incoordination with localgovernment officials.Theresettlement
office of the NingboNWEPPMO will superviseresettlement. Resettlement funds will be
channeledthrough the Cixi Construction Bureaudirectly to households and villages, thus
reducing opportunities for delay or unauthorized commissions. Village committees will play an
important role in monitoringresettlement activities. An independent monitoring institute will
superviseresettlement activities twice a year as required by the Bank. An appropriate grievance
system has beenformulated and will be set up to deal with any complaints. An independent
resettlement monitor will be contracted to report on resettlement activities for Bank supervision
missions.

Consultation and Disclosure
24.     Wide local consultation anddissemination of the project preparation documents and
descriptions of the issueshave beencarried out since these are the primary means of informing
stakeholders. Key stakeholdersinclude the Ningbo and Cixi City government agencies, the
Andong andHangzhou Bay Economic Development Zones, the BridgeCompany, local research
institutes investigatingHangzhou Bay issues, citizens andfishermen along the Cixi coastline,
and local andinternational NGOs. With the Bank's assistance, the Cixi City Government
organized two stakeholder workshops inJune andNovember 2005. Mayor and vice mayors of
the Cixi City, key officials from Ningbo and Cixi government agencies, representatives from
international and domestic NGOs, andprofessors from researchinstitutes and universities
working on Hangzhou Bay wetland issuesparticipated the two stakeholder workshops, and
heatedly debatedhow to pursuethe GEFproject inCixi.




                                                 45

25.     The first workshop was designedto develop a "sustainable vision" for the GEJ? project.
This workshop was successfulinterms of informingall stakeholders about proposedproject
activities andmotivating all stakeholders to present their personalor agencies' views on the
project. This workshop also decided that two studies on the constructed wetland and on the
Wetland Center to be carried out to help stakeholders makescientifically sound decision. The
secondworkshop was carried out by havingkey stakeholderscomment on preliminaryresults of
the two studies. Results of the two studies and suggestionsof an internationally renown wetland
scholar and practitioner provided scientific inputs for all stakeholders to reach an agreement on
the proposeddesigns and the size of boththe constructed wetland andWetland Center. Both
stakeholder workshops were recorded and broadcastedon local television channels. Inaddition,
local newspapers have reportedmajor milestones inproject preparation.
26.     Inaddition to these two stakeholder workshops, aninternational studytour inAugust
2005 providedan precious opportunity for key government officials from boththe Ningbo
Municipal and Cixi City Governments, representativesfrom the Wetlands International and
SCIES to learn international practices in wetland construction and conservation and to develop a
shared vision on the design of the wetlands of their interests.
27.     The final reports of the Studies on the Constructed Wetland andthe WetlandCenter were
disclosed inthe World Bank Infoshop inFebruary and April 2006, andinNingbo and Cixi
libraries and government websites inFebruary andApril 2006.

                              Annex 15: Incremental Cost Analysis
             CHINA: GEFNINGBOWATER AND ENVIRONMENTPROJECT

ProblemStatement

1.       Unprecedented economic growth inEast Asia has resulted inrapidurbanization,
especially incoastal cities. The urban population concentration incoastal regions has causedthe
seas of East Asia to largely bear the brunt of the environmental impact of this development. The
result is that municipalpollutionof East Asia's seas, estuaries andrivers i s a severe problemthat
i s well-recognized by the countries in the region, particularlyChina. In addition, the rapid
population growth incoastal cities such as Ningbo i s makingplanning, financing, and operation
of utility services such as water and wastewater very challenging.

2.       Non-point source pollutionfrom urban and agricultural run-off i s also a large and
growing problem, and a significant contributor to marine pollution. Coastal wetlands provide
natural purificationfor the run-off before it flows into the sea, as well as an important habitat for
migratory birds and marine life. Knowledge of the important eco-systemfunctions providedby
wetlands i s lackingthroughout East Asia. There i s a clear need to increase awarenessand
mobilize public opinion to preserve coastalhabitats andreduce land-basedsources of pollution.

Baseline Scenario

3.       Many of the trends identifiedabove -increased urbanization particularly incoastal cities,
wetland degradation, and pollutionof the sea - are unavoidable inthe short term but the extent
andpace can be managed. Inthe baseline scenario, i.e. no World Bankproject inthe Ningbo
coastal area, these trends will continue, as will Ningbo's challenges with long-term wastewater
treatment. Moreover, important opportunities to conserve wetland habitat, promote
environmental education, and disseminateknowledge will be foregone.

GEFAlternative Scenario

7.       Under the GEF alternative scenario, IBRDfinancing would support Cixi City waste
water collection and treatment investments. However, lack of localexperience with innovative
solutions and concerns about cost would limit the scale of Bank investments to conventional
treatment facilities. GEFco-financing would support a further enhancement of the Cixi
wastewatercomponent of the NWEP.With GEF support, Cixi would utilize the constructed
wetland to provide tertiary treatment for the North wastewater treatment plant.It would also
establish a Wetland Center with a total area of 43.5 km2to protect andconservethe coastal
wetland areas. Finally, GEFfunds will be usedto support the operation of the Wetland Center.

8.       The IBRD-financedNWEP includes the following wastewater comDonent: Cixi
Wastewater (US$128.4 million): The component includes: i)two wastewater treatment plants,
one located inthe north of Cixi (the North WWTP, 100,000 mYday) and one inthe east (50,000
m3/d); andii)associatedcollection system mains and link sewers. The proposedtreatment
process for bothWWTPs i s a modifiedA20process, with conventional chemical coagulation/
filtration methodfor tertiary treatment.


                                                  57

9.      The GEFenhancedNWEPfurther adds the following components:

10. GEFComponent 1- Constructed Wetland For Tertiary Treatment (US$7.12 million). This
component will finance a constructed wetland for tertiary treatment for the NorthWWTP. The
constructed wetland area i s approximately 86 ha and includes a combination of subsurface and
surface flows and will be design to maximizeecological habitat while meeting the required
discharge standards. Cixi Municipal Sewerage Company (CMSC) will be the implementing
agency andfinancing will be providedthrough a combination of sources including IBRDloan
under NWEP, CMSC counterpart funding, and a GEFcontribution of US$l.O million.

11.     GEFComponent 2: Establishmentof aWetland Center (US$8.0 million)
This component will finance the creation a43.5 km2Wetland Center includingan environmental
education andresearchbuildingand facilities, which will help Cixi reduce non-point water
pollution into Hangzhou Bay. The Wetland Center will also promote environmental education
relatedto wetland conservation and the importance of protecting the marineenvironment, as well
enhanceexistingdegradedcoastal habitat. The component will be implemented by the Cixi
Wetland Center Management Company, andwill be financed through counterpart funding
providedby the Cixi City government, Ningbo Municipal Government, and a GEFcontribution
of US$2.0 million.

12.     GEFComponent 3: DesignandManapement Assistance (US$2.0 million)
The Ningbo andCixi implementation agencies have good expertise inproject managementand
construction, but understandably do not have the ecological expertise necessary to independently
design of the constructed wetland and Wetland Center, and to manage the Wetland Center. The
GEFproject will therefore finance the following three activities: i)engineering design of the
Constructed Wetland and the Wetland Center; ii)Management Assistance for the Wetland
Center for four years; andiii)Training andDissemination of Project experience. Management
assistancei s expectedto be providedby a consortium of NGOsAJniversities. The estimated cost
of this component i s about US$2million and will be fully supported by the GEF grant.

IncrementalCosts

13.     As discussedinthe Baseline Scenario section above, without IBRDandGEFsupport, the
no-project scenario would prevail. Inthe GEFAlternative scenario, the additional costs would
be $128.4 million investment under the Cixi Component of NWEPplusthe $17.1 million under
the GEF-NWEPproject.

15.     There i s some overlap between the cost estimates under NWEPand GEF-NWEPfor
tertiary treatment at the North Cixi Wastewater Treatment Plant. Cost estimates under NWEP
for the North Cixi Wastewater Treatment Plant assumeda conventional tertiary treatment with a
capital cost of $1.1 million. The capital costs for the constructed wetland under GEF-NWEPare
around US$7.1 million. The higher capital costs for the constructed wetlands are due to two
factors: i)the extensive earthworks involved increating a 86 ha constructed wetland; and ii)the
wastewater needs to be pumped about 2.1 kms to the site. The constructed wetland, incontrast,



                                                 58

has lower operational costs and simplerobust operational requirements, as well as providing
ecological habitat, reducing nitrogen levels below the effluent standards, and potentially
removingnon-conventional pollutants such as heavy metals. The constructed wetland i s thus
more likely to meet the discharge standard andcontribute to the reduction of pollutioninto
international waters, as well as demonstrating low-operational cost treatment technology.

16.      The incremental cost for this component is therefore conservatively estimated at
US$134.4 milliong,of which GEF will provide US$l.O million.

17.      Components 2 and 3 of the GEFproject were not includedinthe NWEPproject, nor
previously contemplated by the Cixi City Government. Component 2 cost estimates do not
include the cost of land contributed by the Cixi City government, which i s significant. The
successfulmanagement and operation of the Wetland Center will serve as an international show
case for sustainable use and wetland conservation for China andthe East Asia Region. The
incremental costs are conservatively estimatedat US$lO.O million, of which GEFwill provide
US$4.0 million.

18. The total incremental cost for the project i s $144.4 million ($134.4 million for Component 1
plus $10 million for Components 2 and3) of which GEFwill provide$5.0 million. The
following table summarizes the incremental costs andbenefits for the project:

1.STAPExpert'sComments

A. Technicalcomments

The document details a proposal for tertiary treating wastewater usinga constructeda freshwater
wetlands out of reclaimed landintidal wetlands inHangzhou Bay, andfor restoring an
adjoining, degraded, brackish-water, saltmarsh, wetlands. This proposal i s praiseworthy because
the scheme would be beneficial to water quality inHangzhouBay, to wildlife (especially
migratory birds andmarineorganisms), and will be usedas an educational centre as well as for
eco-tourism. The schemei s expectedto be economically self-sustainable after a few years.
There are no obvious or significant environmental negatives.

The document is well written. The proposal i s to be encouraged.

Ihavethefollowingcommentsandsuggestions.

     a. The proposal i s for levelingthe restoredtidal wetlands (A3 and A5) andfor creating a
        freshwater wetland at site Al. There i s considerable literature (e.g. see the review by
        Wolanski andRichmondEncyclopediaof Ecology: Ecological Engineering: Estuary
        restoration. rns # 55 inthe forthcomingElsevier Encyclopedia of Ecology) that shows
        that levelingi s not enough to restore the natural ecology beside the plants. There i s also
        a needfor recreating a drainage pattern approximating that of a natural tidal creek
        drainingasaltmarsh. Experience further suggeststhat this creek shouldbe meandering
        inorder to attract crustaceans.That is a simple engineeringtask; it does make ahuge
        difference to the ecology.
    b. The proposal will only succeedinthe long-term inreducingthe Pnutrientloadin
        Hangzhou Bay if the deadplants from the freshwater wetland (site Al) are annually
        removedanddisposed on land (they couldbe usedfor fertilizers). Thus if Pi s the
        nutrient causing eutrophication incoastal waters the proposal should be modifiedsuch as
        the plants from site A1 are annually removed (maybe on a rotationbasis so that birdlife
        can still remain). (If Ni s the nutrient causing eutrophication then there i s problemno


                                                  61

      problem as the plants should convert the Ninto Ngas). Otherwise, after a few years
      necessaryfor the plants to establishtheir below groundbiomass, this wetland will simply
      start to export nutrients to HangzhouBay. While some nutrients (N)are lost by
      respiration, others are not. This is a basic principle of ecohydrology, a program
      supported by UNESCO. See
      http://www.unep.or.jp/ietc/publications/freshwater/watershed manual/index.asp
   C. Since the wetland area i s still very small, canthe visitor center be built outside site Al,
      for instance insite A4. This i s necessarybecause250,000 people yearly visiting the site
      will frighten the birdlife away andthus negatethe ecotourism benefits that are needed
      for the scheme to be economically self-sustained.
   d. Some of the informationinthe proposal is contradictory. Inpage 17 for instancethe
      outcome indicator i s removingabout 640 MT of Nand 640 MT of phosphorus. Onpage
      36 these amountsbecome, respectively, 550 and600tons. The discrepancy is not huge
      but puzzling.
   e. Onpage 36, the US$14user fee per visitor is incorrect; that should be US$1.40
   f. There is considerable discrepancy withinthetext as to the areaof the freshwater wetland
      Al. Inthe map, basedon the scale shown on the map, the areais 4.4 km'. Inthe text
      however this area i s listedas havin an area of 300 ha (see page4; this is 3 km'), 60 ha
      (page 3; this i s 0.6 km') and42 km (page 39). Since 33 ha (0.33 km') are lost for the
                                           Q
      visitor centre andparking, the true size of the wetlands i s unknowninthis report. This is
      notjust of academic interest -it is fundamental to calculate the residencetime of
      wastewater inthe wetland. A residencetime T of 1week i s proposed (page 19). This
      figure i s acceptable although experience elsewhere suggests that 2 weeks i s better for
      more thorough water treatment. Hence the surface area A of the actual wetland (minus
      the visitor centre and parkinglot area) should be
                              A> T Q/h
     where hi s the mean water depth (reported inthis proposal to be 0.6 m) and Q is the
     wastewater flow rate (50,000 m3d-'). Inview of the discrepancy inthe value of A, this
     needs checking before final approval. It is imperative that this World Bank-sponsored
     project adopts best science-basedengineering practice, and the minimumresidencetime
     should be one week, though two weeks i s preferable. A residence time less than one
     week i s not acceptable to treat wastewaterby wetland filtering - inthat case the wetland
     area has then to be increasedor the wastewater discharge reduced.

B. Generalcomments

     a.   Global environmental benefits and/or drawbacks of theproject.
     This project has great environmental benefits inessentially usingecohydrology, which is
     advocatedby UNESCO (see http://www.unesco.org/water/ihp/ihp-six.shtml) to gain
     social, economic, and environmental benefits from wastewater. Drawbacks are likely if
     the residencetime i s too small (less than 1week minimum).

     b. How the.projectfitswithin the context of the goals of GEF, as well as
     its operational strategies,program priorities, GEF Council guidance and the
     provisions of the relevant conventions.

c.  Regional context.
As discussedinmy new book (E. Wolanski (2006). The environment inAsia Pacific

no use of the ability of usingnatural processes(e.g. filtering by wetlands) to enhance the
robustnessof the aquatic ecosystem. As my new book (E.Wolanski (2006). The
environment in Asia Pacific harbours. Springer, Dordrecht, 497 pp) shows, such
engineering approaches(the `Dutch' approach) have failed to deliver a healthy water
environment to 100million people inthe Asia Pacific. This new project i s excellent in
adding the major new idea of usingnatural processesto reduce eutrophication risks in
coastal waters while providingsignificant social, economic, andenvironmental benefits.

Environmental Managementfor the Seas of East Asia (PEMSEA). One of the main
achievements of the countries through their contribution to PEMSEA has been the development
and adoption of the Sustainable Development Strategyfor the Seas of East Asia (SDS-SEA),
which was endorsed by each of the twelve countries inDecember 2003. The SDS-SEA i s
significant as it i s the first, and the broadest, partnership agreementinthe region to address the
managementof the regional seas. One of the highest priorities for action inthe SDS-SEA i s the
reduction of land-basedpollutionthat has an impact on the marine environment.

2.       The countries of East Asia have recognized that a coordinated andinnovative approach
with a strong focus on scaling up investment i s urgently neededto implement the SDS-SEA.
GEF's new operational modality-the Strategic Partnership-has providedEast Asia with an
opportunity to undertake the necessaryactions with coordinated support from GEF andthe
World Bank. The WB/GEF Partnership Investment Fundfor Pollution Reduction in the Large
Marine Ecosystems of East Asia (the Fund), an US$SO million grant financing facility managed
by the World Bank, was approved by GEFinNovember 2005. The Fundforms the key
financing arm of the East Asia Seas Strategic Partnership.

3.       The objective of the Fundi s to scale-up investments incoastal land-based pollution
reduction inEast Asia through co-financing of projects that remove technical, institutional, and
financial barriers which currently limit efficient investment inpollution reduction. The US$SO
million grant financing providedby GEFi s expected to leveragebetweenUS$SOO million and
US$1.5 billion incounterpart financingfrom the World Bank and other sources, including the
public and private sectors. The Fundhas adopted a coordinated approach to monitoringsuch that
the contribution of all projects to the overall objectives of the Fundcan be measured. Tables 1
and 2 below show the overall Fundindicators and the expectedcontributionof the project.

4.       The GEF - Ninrrbo Water andEnvironmentProiect i s the first project to be financed by
the Fund. This project provides a significant environmental enhancementto the IBRD-financed
Ningbo Water andEnvironment Project (NWEP), which was approvedby the World Bank in
March2005. UnderNWEP, Cixi City, which i s located on the coast of HangzhouBay andthe
East China Sea, will construct two wastewater treatment plantswith a total treatment capacity of
150,000 m3/d. This project will enhance Cixi's wastewater treatment strategy and coastal
management through the provision of a constructed wetland to provide tertiary treatment at the
largest of the two wastewater treatment plants. This pilot i s expected to prove the technical and
economic viability and increasedenvironmental benefits of wetland treatment compared with the
chemical tertiary treatment process more conventionally usedinChina. Inaddition, the project


loThe original twelvecountries includedBruneiDarassalam, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, DPR Korea, R.O. Korea,
Malaysia,Philippines,Singapore,ThailandandVietnam. Three additional countriesjoined in2005 (Lao PDR, Myanmar and
Timor-Leste)makingacurrent total of 15.

will support innovations incoastal managementinChina through the conservation of anatural
coastal wetland for non-point source pollution control, establishment of a wetland education
center, and policy reform to support coastalwetland conservation and management.

5.      ReplicationPotential: Finding simple andeffective methods for wastewater treatment and
buildingpublic support for pollutioncontrol andenvironmental conservation inChina, and
throughout the region, i s critical. The overwhelming majority of Chinese -- 94 percent -- live in
the easternthird of the country. Of China's 1.2 billion people, over 677 million (56 percent)
residein 13 southeast and coastal provinces and two coastal municipalities -- Shanghai and
Tianjin. Along much of China's 18,000 kilometers of continental coastline, populationdensities
average over 600 per square kilometer. Much of the wastewater generatedalong the coast i s
untreatedand flows into the sea, resulting inmassive and frequent redtides, adverse impacts on
marine fisheries and aquaculture, and consequentpublic health problems.

6.      Examples of innovate wastewater treatment and pollution reduction methods, if properly
disseminated andreplicated, will have a significant impact on reducing pollution inthe L M E s of
East Asia. The GEF-supported constructed wetland will provide tertiary treatment for the new
North Cixi wastewater treatment plant. It will reduceBOD and suspendedsolids, as well as
nutrients such as phosphorous andnitrogen, which are the key culprits inthe redtide
phenomena. Constructed wetlands can also be usedas the primary treatment process incertain
situations. Constructed wetlands offer the advantages of generally low capital costs (assuming
landcosts are not prohibitive), robust treatment performance, low operating costs and simplicity
of operations, and environmental amenities. Plot A1 of the Wetland Center will also be designed
to reducenon-point source pollution. Non-point source pollution from agriculturaland urban
run-off i s amajor contributor to pollutant loadings into East Seas. The Wetland Center will
demonstrate that wetlands can be integrated into both the urban andrurallandscapes to provide
wildlife habitat, aesthetic amenities, as well as provide purificationof non-point sources.

8.      ReplicationStrategy: The project will fund a multi-prongedreplication strategy,
including: (i)a series of workshops inNingbo to share experiences for both the constructed
wetland andnatural wetland conservation. Stakeholders from throughout China, including other
coastal cities and national environmental authorities, will be invited. The workshop material will
be inbothinEnglish and Chinese, and representativesfrom PEMSEA will be invitedto attended
and helpdisseminate the experience and workshop documents; (ii)       Ningbo representativeswill
participate inconferences sponsoredby GEFor PEMSEA, such as the biannualGEF
InternationalWaters Congress and the PEMSEA East Asia Seas Congress; (iii) proposed
                                                                                 the
Wetland Center will serve as acomprehensive source of information as people from throughout
China andEast Asia can visit the center and learn more about the GEF-supported activities in
Ningbo. Incollaboration with GEFandPEMSEA, the environmental education center can also
present exhibits about other efforts throughout East Asia to reduce marine pollution andprotect
marineeco-systems.The WetlandCenter will be akey replicationmechanismfor the project.

Inaddition to the project-funded replication activities describedabove, the overallProgram will
also include separately funded-activities to disseminate and promote the adoption of various
technologies andpilot projects financed under the Program.
