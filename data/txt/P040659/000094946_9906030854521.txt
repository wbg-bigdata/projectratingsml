A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The project will (a) test approaches and mechanisms for delivering poverty reduction
interventions to marginalized groups through community nutrition and food security
interventions and activities to assist street children, and (b) test and build capacity, at national
and district levels, for monitoring and evaluating poverty reduction programs.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
Indicators of successfil approaches/mechanisms for targeted service delivery and monitoring ofpoverty
interventions at the district level:
50% of pilot communities able to identify nutrition problems
Decrease in percentage of children 0-6 months with low weight for age in pilot communities
Increase in percentage of children under 5 regularly attending growth-monitoring sessions in pilot
communities
Increase in service coverage for street children
Poverty monitoring system designed and tested in 3 pilot districts -- data collected and used to
plan and monitor district-based programs
Indicators of strengthened capacity at national and local levels:
TCOP/NDPC has demonstrated capacity to coordinate, monitor and evaluate poverty reduction
activities
Pilot communities have increased capacity to access and manage resources
Nutrition unit in MOH has increased its capacity to deliver effective poverty targeted
interventions jointly with districts.
MESW has developed a national policy on street children
Decision to proceed with follow-on operations will be based on assessment of the extent to which the two
sets of indicators above will have been met by the end of the LIL.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 17002-GH                  Date of latest CAS discussion: 09/02/97
The project has been identified in the CAS as one of the key instruments for Bank support to the
government in testing targeted poverty alleviation measures, assessing alternative modalities of
community participation in the delivery of basic services and building capacity where necessary. It
supports the CAS goals of broad-based social development as well as direct poverty alleviation
interventions.



Page 3
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Ghana has made substantial progress in economic growth and poverty reduction since the economic
reform program was introduced in 1983. Data from the Ghana Living Standards Surveys (GLSS) indicate
that between 1988 and 1992, the overall prevalence of poverty declined from 36% to 31%, although some
pockets of rural and urban poverty did not benefit from the overall economic growth, and there was a
significant increase in poverty in the Greater Accra area. Malnutrition remains a serious problem with
30% of children under 5 stunted (GSS 1998). Street children are a growing phenomenon with estimates
of 15,000 in Greater Accra and 7,000 in Kumasi. Various studies indicate that inflationary fiscal policies
after 1992, coupled with sluggish growth, have resulted in more hardship among both urban and rural
poor. Hence, the government is anxious to expand its development strategy to include targeted
interventions for those groups excluded from the overall economic growth including children with
malnutrition in rural areas and street children in urban areas.
At the Consultative Group (CG) meeting in 1995, the Govemment made a commitment to initiate actions
to reduce poverty in Ghana. An Inter-Ministerial Committee on Poverty Reduction (IMCPR) and the
Technical Committee on Poverty (TCOP) were established to coordinate the development and
implementation of policies and programs for poverty reduction. The 1996 paper "Policy Focus for
Poverty Reduction in Ghana" constitutes the Government's policy framnework for poverty reduction in
Ghana over the medium term (1997-2000). It proposes a more focused and targeted approach to poverty
reduction activities, poverty indicators and monitoring. Government commitment to pursue these policies
and programs was reiterated in the 1997 CG meeting.
The Government's efforts to reduce poverty in Ghana face two key process constraints: (a) interventions
are often uncoordinated and sometimes work at cross-purposes, using the same scarce resources at central
and local levels, resulting in de facto capacity depreciation- and (b) many interventions do not start from
analysis of the poor's own priorities and capacity for implementation, but follow traditional top-down
approaches. Good examples of participatory activities do exist. For example, UNICEF has successfully
used nutrition activities as an entry point for wider community development actions, an experience the
government would like to replicate using its own capacities. Street children are a highly visible poverty-
related phenomenon the government is beginning to tackle. Programs exist, implemented by NGOs, but
no government policy has been developed and the co4t-effectiveness of the existing programs has not
been determined. The lack of coordination and lack of a participatory approach are especially acute at the
district level where most poverty reduction activities are implemented, using resources channeled either
through line agencies or directly to districts and communities. Indicators useful for poverty monitoring at
the district level are being collected, but only by the sectoral ministries which pass the information to their
central offices rather than district planning agencies. A first step in better coordination at the district level
would involve better utilization of existing data and improved availability of data on poverty and the
impact of projects.
The Bank has supported the Govemment's poverty reduction efforts through various programs over the
past decade. Adjustment operations support macroeconomic reforms and stabilization, a necessary
condition for poverty reduction. Sectoral programs (e.g., Village Infrastructure, Community Water and
Sanitation, education and health projects) are aimed at alleviating the constraints to a pro-poor
development. However these projects do not directly address marginalized groups and do not address
capacity issues at the district level.
3. Learning and development issues to be addressed by the project:
The government has led project preparation with minimal assistance from the Bank, thereby gaining
valuable experience in designing poverty projects within the existing institutional framework.
Within the policy and implementation framework established by the government for poverty reduction,
the LIL will address the following issues:



Page 4
Nutrition and Food Security - building on efforts by other donors, the LIL will test whether or not the
government can implement similar activities in a sustainable manner. This component will mobilize and
strengthen the capacity of communities and districts to take action against the causes of malnutrition and
to improve nutrition and food security especially for children under five and pregnant and lactating
mothers;
Assistance to Street Children - the LIL will support the government in the development of a national
policy on street children, deepen public awareness of the problem and assess the cost-effectiveness of
street children interventions;
In addition the LIL will strengthen the capacity at the district level for Poverty Measurement and
Monitoring including improved utilization of existing data for planning and analyzing the impact of
social services on the poor.
4. Learning and innovation expectations:
Ix] Economic fxl Financial [ ] Technical lx] Institutional
[x] Social [. ] Environmental [x] Participation [ ] Other
Preliminary analyses of financial, institutional, social and participatory issues have been carried out as
part of project preparation and appraisal (See Section E below). The following are expected to result
from the LIL:
Economic - improved cost-effectiveness of interventions. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be an
important part of project evaluation. Current nutrition programs supported by donors are not sustainable
without external financial and technical support. The nutrition component will test the government's
capacity to provide nutrition interventions in a cost-effective manner. Similarly, the street children
component will test the cost-effectiveness of interventions undertaken by this component.
Financial -- improved capacity for financial management at national agencies responsible for
coordinating and implementing poverty reduction programs
Institutional - effective utilization of existing capacity (national, district and NGO) for delivering and
monitoring services at the district level. Improved capacity for coordination of poverty reduction
programs and development of collaborative implementation modalities between ministries, NGOs and
districts
Social -- improved capacity at district level to help communities organize themselves to identify their
needs and access support to meet these needs, especially in the area of nutrition.
Participation - increased government ability to involve communities in a participatory manner.
Successful experiments tested by the LIL could be financed from available resources under ongoing Bank
operations (e.g., the Village Infrastructure and Community Water and Sanitation Project) or programs
supported by other funding agencies. They could also be followed up with an investment loan on a larger
scale if additional resources prove to be needed.

2. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The primary Implementing Agency for the project will be the National Development Planning
Commission (NDPC), under the supervision of the Technical Committee on Poverty (TCOP).
A Project Steering Committee (PSC), made up of two representatives from TCOP, the heads of
the PLUs, representatives from other projects managed by TCOP and representatives of two
beneficiary district assemblies will play an external advisory role; reviewing work plans and
progress of the project every six months.
The Poverty Reduction Unit (PR U) in the NDPC will be responsible for overall project
coordination on behalf of TCOP and NDPC. The PRU will carry out the following functions:
(a) coordinate implementation of the three project components; (b) coordinate monitoring and
evaluation activities; (c) coordinate procurement actions following procedures acceptable to
IDA; (d) manage the special account to ensure adequate and timely provision of funds for
project implementation, and prepare periodic accounting reports and auditing, following sound
financial management practices, systems and procedures acceptable to IDA; and (e) prepare
annual reports on progress of project implementation to be submitted to the Government and
IDA as the basis for the annual review. A project coordinator will be appointed to the PRU prior
to effectiveness. NDPC has recently hired a financial expert who will be in charge of
disbursement and accounting. Prior to approval the NDPC will appoint a full-time qualified
accounts assistant to be responsible for daily operations of the project accounts and
disbursements and to work with the financial expert in managing the special account.
Technical Advisory Committees (TACs) made up of selected members of the working groups
(that prepared the project) will play the role of internal advisors to the Project Liaison Units;
reviewing work plans, procurement of consultants and service providers and ensuring
implementation progress.
Project Liaison Units (PL Us) staffed by existing employees of the concerned institutions -- the
Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare (MESW), and NDPC --
will be responsible for the technical supervision of their respective components. The heads of



Page 6
the PLUs will be appointed prior to project effectiveness. The PI,Us will carry out the
following functions: (a) select and supervise the activities of the FOs and service providers in
consultation with the districts, (b) provide technical advice to service providers, (c) operate an
efficient financial management and reporting system, (d) liaise with district assemblies and
communities, and (e) manage monitoring and evaluation for the component. The PLUs will
report to their respective agencies and to the PRU.
At the district level implementation of project activities will be coordinated by the district
administration. The District Chief Executive will name a focal person for the project. A
district-level committee, including the focal person, representatives from local communities and
other representatives from the district government, will oversee project activities. FOs will
coordinate their work closely with this committee.
Procurement Methods and Responsibilities. see Annex 6 for different categories of expenditure.
FinancialManagement.
A financial management assessment was carried out for this project. The PRU of NDPC will
have responsibility for the Special Account to be established under this project. There will be 3
sub-accounts for the three components managed by the PLUs. The PRU currently does not meet
the LACI disbursement requirements.
During appraisal the government agreed that for effective project implementation, the PRU
would put in place a sound financial management system. This system should be adequate to
achieve effective budgeting and monitoring of the cost of project activities, efficient internal
control measures, recording and maintenance of up to date accounting records and provision of
project financial data for project management. An acceptable financial and accounting system
would be an effectiveness condition.
AnnuialReviews
The government will conduct, with the Bank, annual reviews of program implementation where
project management will be modified and funds reallocated as appropriate.
3. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements:
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) will be critical features of the project in order to ensure that
useful lessons and experiences are documented and analyzed for their potential replication.
Monitoring and evaluation for each individual component will be the responsibility of the PLU
for that component
In the nutrition component, FOs will monitor selected progress indicators with support from the
PLU. Baseline studies with control groups in project communities will facilitate impact
evaluation. In the street children component, FOs will also be required to monitor process and
impact indicators. External evaluations of the effectiveness of FO interventions will be
conducted annually. Under the Poverty Monitoring and Measurement component, learning
reports will be produced biannually to document findings and assess effectiveness of institutional
arrangements proposed.



Page 7
The PRU will coordinate the monitoring and evaluation by the PLUs. The PRU will coordinate
annual implementation reports for IDA, beginning on September 1, 2000. These reports will be
routed through the NDPC and will summarize progress in project implementation. They will
also highlight any specific issues and learning that have arisen during implementation for which
policy guidance from the Project Steering Committee has been required. The reports should
incorporate the findings of periodic site visits and technical evaluations including those by
extemal consultants on specific aspects of implementing project activities.
The PRU will organize and manage the overall end-of-project evaluation that will analyze each
component in terms of cost-effectiveness and readiness to be scaled-up. The Project Steering
Committee should play an important role in this and other evaluation activities.
D: Project Rationale:
(This section is not to be completed in a LIL PAD)
E: Summary Project Analysis: (detailed assessments for those analyses applicable
to LIL are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic: (supported by Annex 4)
[ ]Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$    million; ERR=  %
[x] Cost Effectiveness Analysis
L ] Other (specify)
The nutrition intervention is based on a successful UNICEF model. The specific design used in this
project is based on an analysis of how to deliver that type of intervention at the lowest cost. Cost-
effectiveness analysis will be an important part of project evaluation. Cost-effectiveness analysis has not
been done prior to the project for the street children component, as the specific intervention will be
designed during the project. In the poverty monitoring component, cost-effectiveness analysis led to the
emphasis placed on improved utilization of existing data rather than design of new data collection
instruments.
2. Financial:                  NPV=US$                     million: FRR=    %
N.A.
3. Technical:
Design of the nutrition component and the street children component was based on successful experience-s=
in Ghana. Inadequacies in the current poverty monitoring system led to the design of the poverty
monitoring activities in this project.
4. Institutional:
a. Implementing agencies: NDPC's role in the govemment is one of coordination, monitoring and
evaluation. Experiences with implementation of donor-financed projects under the current framework for
poverty reduction have been poor. However, NDPC was selected as the central coordinating agency in
order to use existing structures rather than create new ones. The project design minimizes the
implementation activities required of NDPC and strengthens its capacity to coordinate and monitor. The
Nutrition Unit in MOH has considerable experience with activities similar to those in the project. It is
well staffed with technically qualified people and has experience working with other donors. The MOH
has experience working with the Bank and is familiar with Bank procedures. For procurement activities,



Page 8
the project will use existing procurement capacities in the MOH in association with the implementing
agencies until the PRU/PLUs develop sufficient capacity. The roles of the agencies will be defined in the
implementation manual. MESW has limited experience with Bank projects and its capacity will have to
be built under the project. Poverty monitoring is one of the core roles of NDPC and capacity will be
strengthened under the project both to implement monitoring activities and to coordinate with other
agencies.
b. Project management: The PRU will be the central project management unit, supported by the three
PLUs for the different components. A financial expert already in the PRU will handle disbursement and
accounting issues with the help of an accounts assistant. Each PLU will have an accounts assistant
responsible for accounting issues under that component.
5. Social:
There has been extensive work done in Ghana on poverty, including qualitative work examining social
issues linked to poverty. As part of the preparation for this project a social assessment was carried out to
get more in-depth information on the process whereby communities organize to meet needs and on
effective methods of ensuring that community priorities receive extemal support when needed. The
findings of this study highlighted the complexity of decision-making processes with communities
including the differences between the priorities of community leaders and the District Assemblies which
focus on infrastructure and the priorities of other community members which focus on livelihood security.
It also examined gender issues related to community decision-making and the difficulties women have in
participating in discussions with extemal agencies. The study pointed out the need for improved capacity
both wthin district agencies and NGOs for addressing poverty issues at the community level.
This project addresses these issues under the nutrition component which will use participatory methods to
help communities design food security and nutrition interventions. The project will provide training for
NGOs and communities in needs assessment and community organization. The project also supports
capacity-building activities for district and sub-district agencies.

N.A.
7. Participatory approach:
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
The design of the project is based on a great deal of consultation with communities, NGOs, and local
governments. Primary beneficiaries, the local communities, were involved in the initial determination of
needs under the needs assessment (CON). The community nutrition component is designed to be highly
participatory, with communities establishing their own priorities and determining what interventions are
necessary (COL). Selection of monitoring indicators under the poverty monitoring component will be
done through consultation with data users at the district level.
b. Other key stakeholders:
Project design was done by three working groups organized by the TCOP/NDPC, comprised of members
from national and local governments, NGOs, universities and other donors (COL). The Bank's role was
to appraise the design and advise on implementation issues.

Annex 2: Project Description
Ghana: Community Poverty Reduction Project
Government-led working groups containing representatives from a range of government ministries, NGOs,
universities and the private sector have designed the project. Bank inputs have been limited to appraising the
proposed structure and giving advice on implementation issues. The project proposes to (a) test approaches and
mechanisms for delivering poverty reduction interventions; (b) test and build capacity at national and district
levels for monitoring and evaluation; and (c) strengthen collaboration between government and NGOs in targeted
service delivery, with NGOs providing the actual services and government providing supervision and support.
The project has identified three areas of specific focus -- community-based nutrition and food security, street
children, and poverty measurement and monitoring. The project has been designed to use existing government
structures in order to promote sustainability.
Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) will be critical features of the project in order to ensure that useful lessons and
experiences are documented and analyzed for their potential replication. Monitoring and evaluation for each
individual component will be the responsibility of the PLU for that component
In the nutrition component, FOs will monitor selected progress indicators with support from the PLU. Baseline
studies with control groups in project communities will facilitate impact evaluation. In the street children
component, FOs will also be required to monitor process and impact indicators. External evaluations of the
effectiveness of FO interventions will be conducted annually. Under the Poverty Monitoring and Measurement
component, learning reports will be produced semi-annually to document findings and assess effectiveness of
institutional arrangements proposed.
The PRU will coordinate the monitoring and evaluation by the PLUs. The PRU will coordinate the preparation of
annual implementation reports to the IDA, beginning September I, 2000. These reports will be routed through the
LNDPC and will summarize progress in project implementation. They will also highlight any specific issues and
learning which have arisen during implementation for which policy guidance from the Project Steering
Committee has been required. The reports should incorporate the findings of periodic site visits and technical
evvaluations including periodic evaluations by external consultants of specific aspects of implementing project
activities.
'The PRU will organize and manage the overall end-of-project evaluation of results that will analyze each
component in terns of cost-effectiveness and readiness to be scaled-up. The Project Steering Committee should
play an important role in this and other evaluation activities.
1By Component:
IProject Component 1 - Community Based Nutrition and Food Security - US$2.3 million
It is envisaged that the nutrition component will act as a catalyst for broader community development activities.
This component will test, in four target districts, a community-based strategy to strengthen the capacity of
communities to achieve, on a sustainable basis, good nutrition and food security, especially for children under the
age of five and pregnant and lactating mothers. The component's specific objectives are: (i) to reduce the number
of underveight children under five and increase the number of women of reproductive age with a body mass
index (BMI) between 18 and 25; (ii) to increase the awareness of communities about malnutrition and strengthen
their capacity to identify and take appropriate action to address the determinants of malnutrition and to improve
their food security; and (iii) to improve on child care-giving practices, especially the quality and quantity of food
intake of children at home. This component has the following sub-components:
a. The Community-based Nutrition Programme will have the following sub-components:



i) Sensitization of local village authorities: Communities will be asked to elect a community nutrition
worker (CNW) and provide a location for a nutrition center. The project will provide resources for equipping
nutrition centers and will supply basic weighing and measurement equipment.
ii) KAP and community baseline studies
iii) Training of families and childcare givers of children 0-5 years of age, and pregnant women: Education
on child growth and development needs, aspects of social support in the family and community, child health,
including the importance of immunization and other aspects of primary health care, child nutrition, and
environmental sanitation and hygiene.
iv) Growth monitoring and promotion
v) Capacity building for households and community organizations: This includes equipping households,
especially women, with skills to enable them to mobilize and manage resources and initiate viable income
generating activities.
b. Local Initiative Fund: This fund would be used to respond to needs articulated by target communities that are
not covered by other activities under the project: construction of small infrastructure, purchase of equipment, etc.
This fund would not be used the first year of the project in order to test the feasibility of accessing funds from
existing sources. If the project management determines, in conjunction with the Bank, that there is a need for this
fund, criteria of eligibility and the screening process will be developed.
NGOs and/or consulting firms will be contracted to work with communities as the main project implementers,
according to procedures set out in an Operational Manual. The procedures will include a requirement to closely
collaborate with key departments of the district administrations such as planning, community development, health
(including nutrition), agriculture and public works. The selected NGOs or firms will assist communities and
community groups in the identification of development activities that address nutrition and food security issues
and, as a follow-up to these activities, guide community groups to sources of finance and technical assistance for
income generating activities or infrastructure projects.
Project Component 2 - Interventions to Assist Street Children - US$2.3 million
This component will be implemented in 4 urban areas. Activities will include:
(i) provision of resources on a grant basis to existing service providers to enable them to meet the critical needs of
the target population. The component will channel funds to NGOs already working on street children issues to
improve and expand their existing activities. The NGOs will test a variety of services and delivery mechanisms.
A program of possible interventions is being developed which could include:
Providing street children with employable skills
Providing street children with literacy and numeracy skills
Placing a number of street children in formal schools
Intensifying health education for the street children
Improving the productive capacity of parents/guardians
Improving community responsibility towards street children
Strengthening stakeholders
Improving information collection and dissemination
(ii) policy formulation based on a program of research and consultation to determine best practices.
(iii) increasing awareness of the phenomenon of street children through advocacy programs and increased
collaboration among relevant institutions, both governmental, non-governmental and aid agencies. The PLU will
be responsible for coordinating the design of an advocacy program and supervising its implementation.
Interventions under (i) will be evaluated through self-evaluation by the FO implementing the intervention and by
external technical experts contracted by the PLU. The PLU will also be responsible for organizing research to
examine the factors that push children onto the streets and to expand the research already undertaken on the
conditions faced by children on the streets. The PLU will prepare and disseminate documentation on best
practices.



Project Component 3 - Poverty Measurement and Monitoring - US$1.9 million
This component seeks to address the lack of capacity for data collection and analysis at the district level. Good
local data skills are needed to provide the information necessary for policy foTmulation and program coordination
at The local level and for targeting project interventions to improve poverty reduction. The component will
support three districts, through their District Assemblies, to pilot poverty measurement and monitoring systems,
aimed at monitoring individual/household as well community-level poverty. This monitoring system will combine
a set of core poverty indicators common to all districts, as well as contextually specific indicators. The support
will include training in poverty assessments and poverty measurement, information technology, facilities to
enable the districts to store and analyze data, and a monitoring system to enhance leaming
The specific activities in the component are:
Supporting the process leading to the development of agreed indicators for monitoring
household/individual poverty and community-level poverty that reflect local perceptions, but that also contain
elements to facilitate inter-district comparison.
Providing capacity-building support to enable the improved utilization of existing sources of data.
Supporting development of additional data collection instruments, as necessary.
-     Putting in place a monitoring and evaluation system to enhance leaming and possible future scaling up of
the activities.
Project Component 4 - Project Management - US$0.3 million
The primary Implementing Agency for the project will be the National Development Planning Commission
(NDPC), under the supervision of the Technical Committee on Poverty (TCOP).
A Project Steering Committee (PSC), made up of two representatives from TCOP, the heads of the PLUs.
representatives from other projects managed by TCOP and representatives of two beneficiary district assemblies
will play an external advisory role; reviewing work plans and progress of the project every six months.
The Poverty Reduction Unit (PR U) in the NDPC will be responsible for the overall coordination of the project on
behalf of TCOP and NDPC. The PRU will carry out the following functions: (a) coordinate the implementation
of the different project components; (b) coordinate monitoring and evaluation activities; (c) coordinate
procurement actions following procedures acceptable to IDA; (d) manage the special account to ensure adequate
and timely provision of funds for project implementation, and prepare periodic accounting reports and auditing,
following sound financial management practices, systems and procedures acceptable to IDA; and (e) prepare
annual reports on progress of project implementation to be submitted to the Government and IDA, as the basis for
the annual review. A project coordinator will be appointed to the PRU prior to effectiveness to carrvout project
activities. The PRU has recently hired a financial expert who will be in charge of disbursement and accounting.
Prior to approval the NDPC will appoint a qualified full-time accounts assistant to be responsible for daily
operations of project accounts and disbursements and work with the financial expert in managing the special
account.
Technical Advisory Committees (TACs) made up of selected members of the working groups (that prepared the
project) will play the role of internal advisors to the Project Liaison Units; reviewing work plans, procurement of
consultants and service providers and ensuring progress of implementation.
Project Liaison Units (PLUs) staffed by existing employees of the concerned institutions -- the Ministry of Health
(MOH), Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare (MESW), and NDPC -- will be responsible for the technical
supervision of the three components. The heads of the PLUs will be appointed prior to project effectiveness.
The PLUs will carry out the following functions: (a) select and supervise the activities of the FOs and service
providers in consultation with the districts, (b) provide technical advice to service providers, (c) operate an
efficient financial management and reporting system, (d) liaise with district govemment and communities, and (e)



manage monitoring and evaluation for the component. The PLUs will report to their respective agencies and to
the PRU.
At the district level implementation of project activities will be coordinated by the district administration. The
District Chief Executive will name a focal person for the project. A district level committee, including the focal
person, representatives from local communities and other representatives from the district govemment, will
oversee project activities. FOs will coordinate their work closely with this committee.
Financial Management.
A financial management assessment was carried out for this project. The PRU of NDPC will have responsibility
for the Special Account to be established under this project. There will be 3 sub-accounts, one each for the three
components managed by the PLUs. The PRU currently does not meet the LACI disbursement requirements.
During appraisal, the government has agreed that for effective project implementation, the PRU will put in place a
sound financial management system. This system should be adequate to achieve effective budgeting and
monitoring of the cost of project activities, efficient intemal control measures, recording and maintenance of up-
to-date accounting records and provision of project financial data for project management. An acceptable
financial and accounting system would be a dated covenant under the credit agreement.
NDPC has recruited a qualified and experienced professional accountant to help the PRU put in place this system.
The job specification and expectation from the accountant is such that he will need an assistant to effectively
manage prompt preparation of withdrawal applications and other financial reports for management. NDPC has
agreed with IDA to recruit an accounting assistant who will work under the supervision of the accountant as a
condition of effectiveness.
Two of the PLUs located at MOH and MESW will have financial management support from their respective
Ministries in the management of their project accounts. MOH accounts unit has relatively sound financial
systems, and adequate staffing capacity and experience in the handling of IDA resources to offer this service to
the PLU located there, however a scheduled officer will have to be specifically assigned for the task. The MESW
accounts unit will have to receive training from the PRU because of their lack of experience in handling IDA
resources.
Although the project is expected to cany out its activities in the districts, it is not clear what financial
arrangements will be used to control and manage IDA resources. It has been agreed with NDPC that no IDA
resources will be managed at the district level until arrangements acceptable to IDA have been put in place. This
means that initially IDA resources for district activities will be managed at the PLU level.
A simple accounts manual detailing procedures to be followed in the recording and preparation of financial
statements and reports will be prepared by the financial accountant by effectiveness. Although simple, this manual
should cover account codes, authorization procedures, signing-off thresholds, recording and processing of
transactions, and budgeting and reporting mechanisms.
The preparation of financial statements for the overall project, for the purpose of audit and reporting to IDA shall
lie with the PRU. The PLUs will therefore submit periodic financial reports on their component activities to the
PRU. The annual financial statements of the project will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and with FARAH, which has been accepted by the GOG for projects in Ghana. The
financial statements will include at least a statement of sources and uses of funds, a statement of reconciliation of
the special account, a balance sheet and required notes to the financial statements.
An independent auditor acceptable to IDA will audit the financial statements of the project. The auditor will
provide an opinion on:
(a) the project financial statements:



(b) statement of expenditures; and
(c) special accounts.
A management report or letter will be prepared on Intemal Controls and accounting system weaknesses, outlining
any recommendations for improving any weaknesses identified as a result of the financial statement audit. Copies

Main assumptions:
1.    Government contribution to the project consists of: personnel costs of relevant staff in the respective
implementing agencies (NDPC, MOH and MESW and district offices), share of operating costs, and 3% of the
District Assembly Common Fund (DACF). Districts are required by government policy to allocate 20% of the
DACF to poverty alleviation programs.
2.     Estimates are based on current plans. They will be reviewed annually by the Government and IDA and modified
as appropriate in accordance with agreed expenditure plans for the following year.



Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
GHANA: Community-Based Poverty Reduction Project
Guidelines
1. Procurement will follow the World Bank guidelines for procurement of goods, works and services; Guidelines:
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (1995 edition revised January 1999), and Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (1997 edition revised September 1997 and January 1999).
Preference for domestically manufactured goods will be allowed in accordance with World Bank Guidelines.
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures will include: (a) explicit statement to bidders of the evaluation and
award criteria; (b) local advertising with public bid opening; (c) award to lowest evaluated bidder; and (d) foreign
biddlers would not be precluded from participation in NCB.
Procurement Notices
2. A General Procurement Notice [GPN] will be published in the UN Development Business and in a National paper
of wide circulation as provided for in the Guidelines. The GPN would be updated annually in case ICB procurement
would not be completed in the first year of the project. Specific procurement Notices [SPN] would be required for all
ICB and NCB contracts
Procurement Plans
3. A global procurement plan covering the entire project period and a specific procurement plan for the first year of
the project showing contract packages and for each package its estimated cost and procurement method and
piocessing times till completion [including bidding documents for items to be procured under ICB in the first year of
the project] would be prepared and sent to IDA before credit effectiveness. By September 1 of each year, the Project
would prepare and submit to IDA a specific procurement plan for the particular year as part of the annual work plan.
Procurement Implementation Arrangements
4. The Bank has carried out a procurement capacity assessment and has found that NDPC does not have any
capacity to carry out the project's procurement. However, the Ministry of Health which would implement one of the
major components of the project [Nutrition and Food Security] has a procurement unit that has the capacity and
experience in carrying out project procurement. It has therefore been agreed that the procurement unit in the MOH
would be responsible for the project's procurement in association with the implementing agencies. The role of the
implementing agencies will be defined in the project's Operational Manuals. As the project does not involve a lot of
procurement, these arrangements would be sufficient.
Scope of Procurement
5. Goods: estimated to cost US$600,000 -- will consist of vehicles, computers, equipment and miscellaneous items
of supplies and furniture to carry out implementation of project activities including monitoring and evaluation. Two
contracts for vehicles one consisting of about 11 units [estimated to cost US$270,000] and the other consisting of
about 32 motorcycles [estimated to cost US$130,000] would be procured by ICB. Contract packages for computers
and photocopiers [each estimated to be US$50,000] would be procured by NCB while miscellaneous items of
supplies, equipment and furniture costing less than US$30,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$100,000 would be
procured by shopping procedures. Weighing scales estimated to cost about US$20,000 would be procured directly
from UNICEF. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for goods will be used for procurement under ICB
and NCB procedures.
6. Works: no civil works are expected under the project, except in very small quantities of repairs under the grant
funds under "other" and "operating costs" described below.



7. Services: estimated to cost US$1,800,000 -- the project will finance three major consultant contracts [estimated
to cost US$300,000], i.e., Baseline Surveys, Beneficiary Assessment Study and Household Survey. Other contracts
will consist of about 100 small value contracts [estimated total cost US$1,500,000] to be executed over the whole
project period in the three components. These small value contracts would be awarded to individuals and NGOs to
facilitate implementation, mobilization of communities, training of community and district personnel in project
planning and financial management, workshops, monitoring and evaluation activities, consultation and advocacy,
information and education, research and development studies etc. The three major contracts would be procured on the
basis of Quality and Cost Based Selection procedures while all the small value contracts would be by other methods
which would include Least Cost Selection, Selection Based on Qualification, and Single Source Selection depending
on the nature of the assignment. Shortlists for contracts costing less than US$200, 000 may consist of national firms
or individuals only. The Bank's Stantdard Request for Proposals (SRFP) will be used for the selection of consultants.
8. Training: estimated to cost US$500,000 -- will cover training of district and community personnel in delivering
various packages of services under the NFS and SC components, and in data collection, management and
dissemination in the PMM component; also consultation and review workshops. By September 1 of each year, the
Project would prepare and submit to IDA a training plan [as part of the Annual Work Plan] for the particular year for
IDA's review and comments before it is implemented.
9. Operating Costs: estimated to cost US$500,000 -- will cover office supplies, communication and utilities,
maintenance of vehicles and office equipment, fuel, spare parts, office rentals, travel and allowances for project staff
(but excluding salaries of officials of the Borrower's civil service).
10. Other: an estimated amount of US$1,200,000 would be allocated to a grant fund for financing [on a grant basis]
activities of service providers for the Street Children Component. The criteria for selection of the service providers,
the purpose and amount of grant, mode of disbursement of the grant funds and the format of the Grant Agreement to
be signed between the government and the providers will be specified in the Project's Operational Manual. It is
expected that no grant will exceed $100,000.
Bank Review
11. All goods contracts estimated to costthe equivalent of US$100,000 or more will be subject to IDA review in
accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Appendix I of the Procurement Guidelines.
12. For Consultant service, all terms of reference and single source contracts will, regardless of cost, be subject to
prior review. All contracts estimated to cost US$50,000 or more and the first four small value contracts per
component will be subject to prior review by IDA, in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3
of Appendix I of the Consultants Guidelines.
13. All contracts which are not subject to prior review will be selectively reviewed by IDA during project
implementation and will be governed by the procedures set forth in paragraph of Appendix I of the Procurement
Guidelines and the last sub-paragraph of paragraph 2(a) and paragraph 4 of Appendix I of the Consultants Guidelines.
