KIEV DISTRICT HEATING IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. Country Context
1.1          Ukraine, the second largest country in Europe with a population of over 50 million
people, is still struggling to transform its flagging post-Soviet economy into one based on market
principles, despite more than six years of efforts to that end. Sluggish economic reforms and rampant
hyperinflation during the first three years after Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in
August 1991, combined with the external shocks of sharply higher energy prices and reduced sales to
traditional markets, significantly compounded the economic situation. Despite a considerable degree of
price and exchange rate stability achieved in the last three years, the decline in production has only
slowed but not stopped. According to official statistics, the Ukrainian economy has slumped by nearly
60% from 1991 to 1997. Living standards have also fallen sharply and poverty became more
widespread. Annual per capita GDP has declined from US$ 1,250 in 1995 to US$ 1,020 in 1997. The
Government has accumulated over US$ 2.5 billion of wage arrears and debts to the public sector by the
end of 1997.
1.2         Nevertheless, there have been indisputable accomplishments in the past three years.
The annual level of inflation has been brought down from 8000% at its peak in the Fall of 1993 to 16%
in 1997. A new currency, the hrivnya, was introduced in September 1996 and fluctuated by no more
than 5% until late 1997 when a wider currency corridor was introduced allowing a modest depreciation
of the currency. A significant degree of current account convertibility has been established. The trade
regime has also been liberalized. Domestic prices have largely been decontrolled, consumer subsidies
reduced and energy prices increased to world levels for non-household users and substantially increased
for household users. Further reduction in consumer subsidies is expected after the elections in March
1998. In addition, tax and accounting reforms have been initiated with the introduction of a modern
profit tax and adoption of international accounting standards by commercial banks.  A radical
restructuring of the energy sector is underway, and a mass privatization program is to be completed by
the end of 1998. Large-scale privatization has been launched with shares in a number of flagship
Ukrainian industrial enterprises and energy and telecommunications companies to be sold at auctions
this year.
1.3          However, officially recorded production is still declining, albeit at a much slower pace.
In 1997, real GNP fell by 3.2% as compared to 10% in 1996, 12% in 1995 and 23% in 1994. These
figures excessively dramatize the production declines since they do not fully account for goods and
services produced in the shadow economy, which is estimated at 40-60% of the overall economy. The
problem of financing an excessively large budget deficit through borrowing came to a head in the Fall
of 1997 when the cost of borrowing in the domestic capital markets shot up due to crowding out and
the contagion effects of the East Asian crisis. Faced with repayments due on maturing T-bills and
pressures to pay the backlog of wages, the Government of Ukraine has continued to borrow extensively
in hrivnyas in the domestic T-bill market and in the international markets at extremely high risk
premiums. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian leadership realizes that the only way forward now is to
maintain macroeconomic stability while pressing ahead with structural reforms to raise much needed
revenues for the state budget, attract investments into the economy and dispose of inefficient state
enterprises constantly lobbying Government for subsidies and favors. This will ultimately lead to
economic recovery and improved standards of living for the population. The World Bank and the



2
International Monetary Fund (IMF) support Ukraine in its efforts to implement reform policies. The
IMF is working with the Government to develop an Extended Funding Facility. Currently the World
Bank is supporting eleven projects totaling more than US$ 2 billion in Ukraine.
1.4          The Bank's overall strategy in Ukraine calls for a graduated expansion of the lending
program in line with the intensity of the reform effort. This approach will allow the Bank to respond
promptly in support of broader and deeper reforms while avoiding burdening Ukraine with debt that
would not contribute to economic recovery and improved creditworthiness. The Bank intends to
continue to provide Ukraine with a high level of non-lending services and engage the Government and
civil society in an intensive policy dialogue under all scenarios. The energy sector is a very high
priority area, given the dramatic price increases which have occurred since independence, the
significant dependence on energy imports and the resulting need for energy conservation and
improvements in efficiency of energy facilities. A central part of the Bank's strategy will be to
continue to support energy sector reforms aimed at creating a market environment conducive for
private participation.
B. Overview of the Energy Sector
1.5          Energy Demand. Energy demand in Ukraine is characterized by high energy intensity
of industrial output and the high share of industry in final energy consumption, due to the low thermal
efficiency of energy consumption technologies and high share (about 40% in 1995) of industry (iron
and steel, basic chemicals) in GDP. Energy consumption per capita was about 3,000 kilogram oil
equivalent (koe) in 1996, which is high compared to Western European standards. Following a modest
decline of 11% between 1985 and 1990, the energy intensity of official GDP increased 60% in the
1991-95 period reaching 5.2 koe/US$, a ratio that is several times higher than in developed countries.
The true energy intensity of GDP, however, is likely to be substantially lower due to the large size of
the shadow economy.
1.6          Primary Energy Resources. Ukraine has vast coal resources, important oil and gas
resources and significant hydro, wood, peat and uranium resources. Donbass, the main coal mining
basin, contains metallurgical coal, anthracite and high grade thermal coals, as well as coalbed methane
gas. The unusually difficult geological conditions in central Donbass make the mining of coal costly
and labor intensive. Crude oil and natural gas resources are declining, but are still significant.
Remaining proven and probable reserves are 190 million tons of oil and 1,400 bcm of natural gas. The
shallower and larger, oil and gas pools in the Dnieper-Donetsk and Carpathian regions are rapidly
being depleted. These deposits are being replaced by reserves in smaller, deeper and less productive
reservoirs, which are more expensive to find, drill-up and produce, to the point that a large part of the
reserves appear to be uneconomic. Hydro resources are significant but are almost fully developed,
while wood and peat resources appear to have greater potential. Ukraine also has significant uranium
reserves and receives nuclear fuel, in exchange for its uranium mined domestically and extracted from
warheads of dismantled missiles, for its sizable nuclear electricity generating capacity.
1.7          Energy Supply. Domestic energy production, consisting of fossil fuels and primary
electricity (hydro and nuclear power), represented 45-50% of consumption in the 1990-97 period (see
Table 1.1 below). Domestic energy production steadily declined during the period; most of the decline
was due to decreased coal and natural gas output. The main energy import items include crude oil and
oil products mostly from Russia, natural gas from Russia and Turkmenistan, and coal from Russia and
Poland. The cost of fossil fuel imports reached about US$ 6.2 billion in 1993 and increased to US$ 7.5
billion in 1995 and to US$ 8.7 billion in 1996, creating a demand for foreign exchange that the
economy was unable to meet. The difference was financed by payment arrears to Russia and
Turkmenistan (the arrears were subsequently converted to debt) and balance-of-payment support from



3
the IMF and the World Bank. In 1997, the cost of fossil fuel imports decreased to about US$ 7.6
billion, mainly as a result of the decrease in gas imports.

1.8            Energy Prices. Since 1991, energy fuel prices have skyrocketed and now approximate
world market levels. Most notable are the prices of natural gas and crude oil, utilized primnarily in heat
and electricity production, which increased from about $ 0.25/1,000 m3 and $ 1.35/ton to about
$80/1,000 m  and $106/ton, respectively, during 1996 as shown in Figure 1.1 below and remained
about the same in 1997. The price increases of energy inputs were translated into higher prices for
essential services, especially electricity and heat. Electricity, gas and coal prices are set by the central
government, while district heating (DH), LPG, heating oil, peat and wood prices are set by local
governments. Household energy prices cover 50-80% of costs, with household DH prices, outside of
Kiev, currently covering 80% of costs but are expected to cover 100% of costs in the near future. The
difference between costs and prices is covered by subsidies from the central and local governments



4
and/or by cross-subsidies from industrial to household consumers (particularly for DH). In Kiev, DH
prices currently cover costs without cross-subsidies.

1.9          Non-payment by customers became a major problem for electricity, gas and heat
suppliers in 1994-95, weakening the financial position of the utilities. In September 1995, the
Government issued a resolution on the non-payment of energy bills requiring that all non-payers be
disconnected and also providing indemnity to energy suppliers in the case of damages to consumers.
The implementation of the resolution was unsatisfactory during the unusually cold winter of 1995/96,
but it improved rapidly in mid-1996. A new government resolution was issued on August 1, 1996,
calling for businesses which fail to pay their electricity bills to have their power supply cut off. Earlier
in February 1995, the Government introduced the Housing and Municipal Service Allowance Program
(HMSAP), which allows families whose monthly payments for housing, water and sewerage, hot
water, heating and other municipal services that exceed 15% of monthly income to apply for an
allowance equal to the difference. The Bank approved a loan m August 1996 to assist the Govermnent
to cope with the growing demand from applicants for these allowances; the loan is supporting the
computerization requirements to improve the administration of HMSAP. Despite HMSAP, payment
discipline in the household sector remains poor as also is the case for the agriculture and budgetary
sectors. As household energy and other service prices are further raised to cost recovery levels, the
requirements for targeted assistance to households is expected to continue over the near term, until
household incomes grow commensurably with the rise in service prices, after which targeted assistance
would be needed for only the poorest income groups.
1.10         Sector Institutions. The main government agencies in the sector are the Ministry of
Coal Industry, the Ministry of Power and Electrification (Minenergo), the State Committee for the Oil
and Gas Industry and the State Committee for Energy Conservation. The State Committee for Housing
and Communal Services also plays a role in overseeing municipal-owned DH enterprises. In 1994-95,
the Government implemented a corporatization program in the oil, gas and power subsectors, with the
long-term objective of privatizing most of the assets and activities except those that are considered of
strategic importance (e.g., oil, gas and electricity transmission lines, nuclear plants, dispatch centers).
The Cabinet of Ministers also has approved a privatization plan of state-owned, joint-stock energy
generating and distribution companies, including Kievenergo, whereby investment competitions could
be conducted after passage of a law regulating investors' activities. The corporatization program of the
coal industry was started in 1996, parallel with a program to close uneconomic mines.

C. Energy Sector Policy and Strategy
1.11         In 1992-93, the Government's reaction to the increase in the price of energy imports
and cost of energy supply was to rely on methods of central planning such as price controls, cross-
subsidization among consumer classes, and the rationing of energy, rather than allowing market
mechanisms to regulate and balance supply and demand. A key reason concerned the political risk of
increased unemployment inherent in market-based solutions.  Another prominent concern was
dependency on one supplier, Russia, for half of Ukraine's primary energy needs.
1.12         In late 1993, the Government prepared a "Concept for the Development of the Energy
Sector of Ukraine for the Period up to 2010." The "Concept" was subsequently approved by the
Parliament. It spelled out the following main directions for Ukraine's long-term energy strategy: (a)
the development and implementation of a policy that promotes energy savings; (b) economically and
environmentally justified utilization of domestic energy sources; (c) restructuring of the economy to
reduce the energy intensity of production; and (d) increasing reliance on alternative (renewable) energy
sources. The investment program outlined in the "Concept" recognized the priority of rehabilitating
capacities in the power, heating, coal, gas and oil subsectors, and it also included a number of
ambitious expansion schemes in coal mining, oil and gas production, and nuclear power generation.
1.13         In early 1994, the Parliament passed a Law on Energy Conservation.  The Law
provides economic incentives for investments in energy conservation. Specifically, it calls for the
establishment of national and local extra-budgetary funds, based on special taxes on coal and on
penalties for inefficient energy use by industrial enterprises, to support energy savings initiatives. In
order to prepare the necessary regulations and to coordinate the implementation of the Law, a State
Committee for Energy Conservation was established in July 1995. The Government approved the
regulations for the operation of the national extra-budgetary Energy Efficiency Fund in February 1996.
To-date, however, revenues of the Energy Efficiency Fund have been relatively insignificant.
1.14         A long-term Comprehensive State Energy Conservation Program was announced in
August 1996 which aims at achieving an annual savings by the year 2010 of about 109 million tons of
coal equivalent, more than the total output of coal, gas and oil in Ukraine in 1996 or about one third of
total energy consumption of Ukraine in 1996. While the energy conservation potential for any year
depends on the general structure of the economy (e.g., surviving industries), GDP, fuel consumption
rates, capacity utilization, among other things, the structure of energy conservation potential has been
estimated at 42-48% of 1990 consumption or about 145-170 million tons of coal equivalent to be
achievable in relative terms from the following sectors over the period: manufacturing - 57%, power
industry - 21%, public services and utilities - 12%, transport - 7% and agriculture - 3%. Within the
public services and utilities sector, a number of measures have been identified to improve energy
efficiency in heating systems, water supply and sewerage systems, housing development and urban
transport. The main measures targeted in the heating sector include the replacement of obsolete boilers
with ones of higher efficiency, introduction of anti-corrosion protection of heating systems and
insulated pipelines, introduction of automation and control systems at consumers and production plant,
and utilization of alternative fuel and energy sources. These measures are to be complemented with
energy efficiency measures inside buildings, including heat meters. As highlighted in the Conservation
Program, the main impediment to implementation of the energy efficiency measures is the lack of
investment funds.
1.15         In mid-1995, the Government prepared and submitted to the Parliament the "National
Energy Program of Ukraine up to 2010." The "Program" was approved by the Parliament in early
1996. It follows the main policy directions established in the "Concept." For the DH sector, the
Program calls for the continued development of centralized DH systems as well as for the development
of combined-heat-and-power (CHP) plants. The Program acknowledges the need to reconstruct and



6
rehabilitate existing DH equipment, install new capacities and construct new high efficiency heat-only-
boilers (HOBs) with capacities up to 180 Gcal/h, and promotes the use of waste gases in heat
production. Total Ukraine heat demand has been projected to increase from 166,000 Gcal/h in 1995 to
about 203,000 Gcal/h by 2010, to be covered by increasing heat production by about 6.7% from CHP
plants and by about 11.3% from HOBs.
D. Kiev District Heating (DH) Conditions and Priority Needs
1.16         The Kiev DH system, with a capacity of about 15,000 Gcal/h and networks totaling
2,300 km, is the third largest in the countries of the FSU, after the Moscow and St. Petersburg
systems, and is thought to be the third largest in the world. In Kiev, the DH system provides most of
the heat and hot water for urban dwellers as well as steam for industry, produced in CHP or in HOB
plant and transported through pipeline networks to substations to buildings.
1.17         The Kiev system consists of several DH operators, including Kievenergo which
supplies heat to the main system and owns and operates the main heat sources, consisting of two CHP
plants (TETS 5 and TETS 6) and about 9 large boiler houses (2,400 Gcal/h from turbines and 3,900
Gcal/h from HOBs) and the main transmission network (768 km). Kievenergo transfers heat from its
own plants as well as heat purchased from one CHP plant (TETS 4) operated by a cooperative, which
leases the facility from the state, to the distribution system (460 km), owned and operated by the Kiev
Municipal District Heating Company (KMDHC) which is responsible for supplying heat to end-users.
KMDHC also operates several isolated networks in the city (200 km) and associated boiler houses (800
Gcal/h). In addition, several other entities are responsible for heat supply in other isolated networks
(7,900 Gcal/h), including industrial enterprises (5,000 Gcal/h).
1.18         The main Kiev DH system is technically well-designed, with a share of heat from CHP
plant in the main system at about 50% of total heat production, bringing it near the economic optimum
theoretically achievable under constant flow conditions and contributing to low costs of heat
production. The Kiev system also includes some highly economical, advanced technology solutions at
its 300 MW CHP plants (TETS 5 and TETS 6) which have supercritical steam conditions achieving a
higher electricity yield per produced heat unit than conventional CHP plants.
1.19         Despite the overall contraction of Ukraine's economy, particularly the industrial sector,
since independence, the City of Kiev presents a net growth both in terms of population (2.7 million
growing at about 1 % per year) and local economy, a trend which is expected to continue (see Annex
1). The lack of adequate heat in the growing city center and suburban residential areas represents a
severe bottleneck to growth. At the city center, the capacities of the main boiler plants (CT-1, CT-2)
have been reduced due to the lack of rehabilitation and replacement investments to pumping capacity
and boilers, which are nearly 50 years old. Furthermore, contrary to normal practice, the Kiev system
does not have any standing reserve capacity. As an illustration, in October 1996 when the outdoor
temperature was only +2°C, the operable parts of the plants were working at two-thirds of their
available capacity, which clearly indicates that capacity will be insufficient when the outside
temperature is at the design level of -22°C. As a result, heat supply to households is being rationed and
the development of new and renovated office space, hotels and other buildings is severely constrained.
1.20         The weight point of new residential housing development in Kiev is at Pozniaki
subdivision, located in the southeastern section of the city. The population occupying existing buildings
and apartments at present is approximately 260,000. This area is under continuous construction, and in
the year 2002, the population is estimated to grow to 370,000. Due to the lack of investment funds,
not even the first unit of the boiler plant to supply Pozniaki subdivision with heat has been able to be
completed. As an emergency solution, a pipeline has been constructed from the already-overloaded



7
TETS 5 CHP plant to the area. Through this pipeline, the existing occupied apartments are served with
some heat, facilitating an indoor temperature of barely + 100C currently during the winter season. As a
result, residents at Pozniaki subdivision are facing a crisis situation with regard to heating and hot
water services.
1.21         Since independence, maintenance of the Kiev DH system has also been underfunded,
resulting in serious corrosion of present assets, especially pipelines, due to the deteriorating water
quality. Heat and water losses are high as compared to Western systems, with heat losses in the
transmission and distribution systems estimated at about 20% overall, whereas ultimately, these losses
could be reduced to 6-8% through the sealing of leaks that occur at corroded network sections and
equipment. The volume of make-up water that needs to be added to the system annually varies from 5-
45 times depending on the network and compares poorly with make-up water quantities of 1-2 times
annually in Western systems. The replacement value of the presently corroding assets has been
estimated at more than $ 3 billion, and therefore investments aimed at reducing corrosion and
extending the lifetimes of these assets would have high economic and financial benefits.
1.22         The lack of automation and heat metering at consumer connections in substations and,
to some extent, at boiler plants results in additional wastage of heat energy in the Kiev DH system.
The system operates on constant flow and variable temperature conditions, rendering the dispatch of the
heat load to plants having the lowest generation cost cumbersome. Introduction of a variable flow
regime through automated substations with consumption metered and controlled by consumers could
reduce heat energy consumption by as much as 25 % for the same service levels.
E. Bank Strategy, Past Experience and Project Rationale
1.23         The Bank's overall strategy is to support Ukraine's efforts to accelerate structural
reforms and to promote efficient investments in high priority sectors in order to complete the transition
of the country to a market economy, accelerate the rate of economic growth and increase efficiency.
This will require strengthening key financial institutions, accelerating privatization, extending the
openness of the policy environment, rehabilitating and re-orienting its physical infrastructure, and
extending the social safety net and the efficient delivery of social services.
1.24         The Bank approved the first loan of US$ 27 million equivalent to Ukraine in June 1993
to finance an Institution Building Project (Ln. 3614-UA) aimed at supporting enterprise and financial
sector reform and public economic and financial management; this project is still ongoing. The second
Bank operation was a Rehabilitation Loan (Ln. 3831-UA) of US$ 500 million equivalent approved in
December 1994, and implementation of the Loan was satisfactory. This Loan provided financing for
critical imports needed to stem the decline in production and to cushion the deterioration of living
standards of the population. The third Bank operation was the Hydropower Rehabilitation and System
Control Project (Ln. 3865-UA) of US$ 114 million equivalent approved by the Bank's Board in April
1995, signed in September 1995, and declared effective in May 1996. Despite the lack of substantive
issues, the Government's approval process preceding submission of the loan documents to Parliament
for ratification took many months. Learning from this experience, the Bank provided assistance to the
Government to simplify its loan approval procedures. The following operations, the Coal Pilot Project
(Ln. 4016-UA), the Enterprise Development Adjustment Loan (Ln. 4057-UA), Agriculture Sector
Adjustment Loan (Ln. 4103-UA), Social Protection Support Project (Ln. 4097-UA) and Export
Development Loan (Ln. 4107-UA) have reached effectiveness considerably faster. Further Bank
energy operations, including the Coal Sector Adjustment Loan (Ln. 4118-UA) and the Electricity
Market Development Project (Ln. 4098-UA), became effective during December 1996 and January
1997, respectively. A Treasury Systems Project (Ln. 4285-UA) was approved during February 1998.



8
1.25         The Bank has been involved in the Ukrainian energy sector since early 1992.  An
Energy Sector Review (Report No. 11646-UA) was issued in 1993, leading to an Energy Strategy
Conference held in Kiev in June 1993. During the Conference, an understanding was reached that the
Bank's lending operations should aim primarily at the rehabilitation of existing assets rather than
construction of new facilities where existing capacity is sufficient, while supporting initiatives that
increase the financial and operational autonomy of enterprises and foster competition. After the
Conference, the Government, assisted by the Bank and other multi- and bilateral agencies, started the
preparation of a number of projects to rehabilitate hydropower plants, thermal power plants, and gas
transmission, distribution and metering facilities.  The completion of a pump storage plant,
restructuring of the coal industry, and energy efficiency investments in DH were added to the agenda in
1995. Utilizing donor funds, the Bank provided technical services in the areas of industrial energy
audits; rehabilitation of thermal, hydropower and DH plants; gas distribution and metering; legislation
for oil and gas production; and power industry institutional, regulatory and legal reforms. The Bank
has also been actively supporting the dialogue between the G-7 and the Government of Ukraine in the
area of nuclear safety.
1.26         The proposed Loan represents the first Bank investment loan to Ukraine in the DH
sector. Past experience in implementation of other Bank-supported DH projects is available from
projects in Poland, China, Estonia and Latvia, all on-going. Some lessons learned to-date include: (a)
strong project ownership and advanced preparation of project components is necessary for timely
implementation, (b) decentralized project management arrangements work far better than centralized
arrangements, (c) the relationship between prices and incomes changes rapidly in countries in transition
and the heating service which appears largely unaffordable will become easier to afford in a relatively
short period of time, (d) end-user efficiency improvements, which initially appear difficult to support
due to building ownership and affordability reasons, may be possible to support on a pilot level, (e)
there is the possibility to redress the financial difficulties of DH companies during project preparation
through tariff increases and settlernent of arrears by major debtors, including households, and (f) strong
support from municipalities is needed to resolve collections and payment issues. These lessons have
been considered during the preparation period of the proposed project. The project represents an
important case study for an ongoing ESMAP-sponsored study on DH systems which is examining
industry structure, alternatives to DH and the conditions under which building efficiency improvements
can best be supported.
1.27         The proposed project is consistent with the Bank's overall Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) in Ukraine, discussed by the Bank's Board in June 1996, as well as the interim strategy in the
CAS Progress Report, and which assigns emphasis to the energy sector and seeks to support Ukraine's
efforts to improve energy efficiency by replacing or rehabilitation old production facilities, networks
and substation equipment. The strategy also calls for greater efforts in energy conservation, pricing
and ownership. The project is also fully consistent with the Government's energy strategy, would
support energy conservation, improvement of the efficiency of energy facilities and environmental
conditions, and rehabilitation of existing plants. The efficiency gains would lead to lower costs of heat
production and operation thereby resulting in more affordable heat tariffs and lower requirements for
social assistance. Most importantly, the quality and reliability of heating services would be improved
for the current and growing demand. At the same time, institutional development programs for
concerned energy agencies would help strengthen their management and operations.

II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin
2.1          Based on an official request from Kievenergo, the key enterprise providing heat in
Kiev, a Bank mission visited Ukraine during June 1995 to explore the possibility of Bank support for a
project to improve the DH system and service in the capital city of Kiev. Kievenergo emphasized the
urgent need to rehabilitate and expand the DH system in Kiev in order to improve the currently poor
service and provide for the growing population in the city. At that time, agreement was reached with
Kievenergo and also with Kiev Municipal DH Company (KMDHC), owning part of the DH system, on
a possible project focused on DH improvements in Kiev as well as for the need for consultancy studies
to carefully review the priority requirements and establish the feasibility of an affordable investment
program.
2.2          In July 1995, the Government, through the Ministry of Economy, formally approved
the Kiev DH project concept for further study. With World Bank support, terms of reference for the
required feasibility, engineering and institutional studies were prepared. Since the Kiev system is large
and the support required for the background studies was too great for one donor, funding was sought
from two sources, the United States Trade and Development Agency and the Finnish Government.
Consultants (Joseph Technology and Ekono Energy) were selected under competitive procedures. Both
firms are utilizing Ukrainian institutes (Ukrenergoprom and Kievproyekt) on their teams to ensure the
full use of information available in Ukraine and to promote the transfer of knowledge in the preparation
of the investment studies.
2.3          During September 1995, the Bank received official requests from  Sevastopol
Municipality and its DH company for a heat supply improvement project in Sevastopol as well as from
the newly-established State Committee for Energy Conservation for an energy efficiency project
addressing the needs of schools and hospitals in Kiev. Initially, it was planned that these additional
requests would be combined with the Kiev DH request into one Heat Supply and Energy Efficiency
Project. However, due to the different timetables for identifying grant funding for feasibility studies
and selecting consultants, it was subsequently agreed that these new requests would become separate
projects. The proposed Kiev Energy Efficiency Project in Public Buildings, when implemented
(expected to commence in 1999), would complement the proposed Kiev District Heating Improvement
Project by reducing the high energy losses in the larger public users of DH in the Kiev system.
2.4          In accordance with the agreed timetable, appraisal of this project took place in March
1997. Technical specifications and draft bidding documents have been prepared for the first year's
goods and works contracts so that bidding would be able to commence shortly after Loan negotiations.
It is expected that a number of contracts could be ready for award around the time of Loan
effectiveness.



10
B. Project Objectives
2.5          The project, which would be the first DH investment project in Ukraine designed to
address the most critical needs in Kiev, would have the following main objectives:
(a)   to replace and increase heat production capacity to better meet existing and
expected future demand and to improve the reliability and service levels in the
Kiev DH system;
(b)   to extend the life of, increase the efficiency of and enhance conservation of the
Kiev DH system, through rehabilitation and introduction of modern
technologies and materials; and
(c)   to  promote  sound  cost recovery  policies  and  practices  and  the
commercialization and institutional strengthening of project DH companies, to
identify the most efficient corporate and institutional structure for provision of
DH in Kiev and ways to facilitate the eventual privatization of the service, and
to support project implementation.
C. Project Components and Description
2.6          The project would consist of the following components listed below and described in
more detail in Annex 2:
(a)   heat production capacitv improvement component, including replacement
(560 Gcal/h) and construction of new boilers (1,580 Gcal/h) along with
rehabilitation of other boilers in the main DH system, to alleviate the current
deficit of heat production capacity and to better meet the existing and growing
demand;
(b)   DH rehabilitation component, including a substantial program of transmission
(80 km) and distribution (15 km) pipeline and network improvements in the
main DH system, water treatment and substation (1,500) improvements,
including heat meters (1,500) and construction of a stack in the city center, to
address the deteriorating technical conditions and outmoded technology, and
rehabilitation of an electric substation (2 x 40 MVA) and power cables in the
city center to provide adequate electric supply for boiler houses and DH
pumping equipment; and
(c)   institutional support component for project agencies, including consultancy
and advisory services, training, equipment and software for project management
and implementation, for audits and for review of appropriate institutional and
corporate structures for DH enterprises, including support for implementation
of recommendations.
2.7          Kiev DH System. The main part of the Kiev DH system, owned and operated by
Kievenergo and KMDHC, consists of 10 major networks served by 2 CHP (TETS 5 and TETS 6) and
9 large HOB plants (including CT-1 and CT-2 in the city center) and a number of small isolated
networks served by 112 small HOB plants. The main fuel for all boilers and CHP units is gas,
although the larger boilers and CHP units can use mazut as well, and a few of the smaller boilers use
coal. Nearly all of the major networks in the main system are interconnected but operated during the



11
heating season as separate networks. The main system includes 21 booster pumping stations which are
needed to transfer heat to various elevations over long distances. For the main networks, there are also
dispatch centers to monitor and control operation of the system. In the main system, about 2,200
consumer substations are operated and maintained, of which about 800 are large substations serving
groups of about 10-15 buildings. Only about 150 of the large substations are metered. A map of the
Kiev DH system is included. The DH systems owned and operated by industrial and other enterprises
are not included in the project.
2.8          The investments in heat production plant would include replacement of old, worn-out
boilers at CT-1 and CT-2 plants with new boilers, including two 100 Gcal/h and two 180 Gcal/h hot
water boilers, and expansion of boiler capacity, including construction of three 100 Gcal/h and one 180
Gcal/h hot water boilers, as well as rehabilitation of other boilers and construction of a new 100 m high
stack at CT-1 plant to improve the environmental conditions in the dense city center. In addition, a
program of expansion of boiler capacity at TETS 5 and TETS 6 CHP plants, including construction of
three new 180 Gcal/h hot water boilers, would be undertaken along with a program of reconstruction
of the water treatment system at TETS 5 in order to reduce effluent pollution and increase water
treatment system capacity. The partially-constructed boiler house at Pozniaki subdivision would be
completed and equipped with two 100 Gcal/h and two 180 Gcal/h hot water boilers. The additional
boiler capacity would be sufficient to cover today's heat production capacity deficit in the main DH
system and allow for a small portion of the estimated future capacity requirements, as explained in
Annex 1.
2.9          The DH rehabilitation investments would include a substantial program of replacement
of old transmission and distribution pipelines and valves and installation of 1,500 substations including
heat meters. According to experience in other Bank-supported DH projects (e.g., Jelgava, Latvia),
installation of heat meters without automation equipment does not contribute to any significant energy
savings. Therefore, heat meters are being installed under the project only where automation equipment
is being installed. The utility would be expected to use the meters to improve their measurement of
heat and water losses. Further, in order to ensure adequate electricity supply to the city center and for
DH pumping stations and boiler plant, the Center electric substation (2 x 40 MVA) and power cables
will be replaced.
2.10         Institutional Support Component. A package of support which is necessary to better
ensure the successful implementation of the project and the development of DH companies to facilitate
an appropriate institutional structure and their commercial operations would be included in the project.
Terms of reference for the consultancy and advisory services were discussed and agreed during
negotiations. The component consists of the following items summarized below:
(a)   Restructuring Study of the Kiev DH Companies: to review options for the
most efficient institutional and corporate structure for DH in Kiev, to identify
the requirements for effective management, corporate and operations systems
and to provide support for implementing the study recommendations;
(b)   Implementation Support and Audits:  including consultancy services for
detailed design, construction supervision, procurement and disbursement, and
auditing services for the incremental auditing costs of the project; and
(c)   Training and Equipment: for training of the management and staff of the DH
companies in the areas of procurement and disbursement, introduction of
international accounting standards, computerized billing, and environmental
issues, among other things, and provision of office equipment, computers and
software.

D. Cost Estimates
2.11         The total project cost is estimated at US$ 308.9 million equivalent (UAH 814.0 million)
of which US$ 240.7 million (UAH 634.2 mnillion) or about 78% is the foreign exchange component.
Import duties are estimated at about US$ 3.8 million equivalent and are included in the cost estimates.
The duties represent about 1.2% of the total project cost. Base cost estimates are expressed in
February 1998 prices. Summary project costs are shown in Table 2.1 and detailed cost estimates are
given in Annex 3.
2.12          Project costs were estimated by project agencies and their consultants, based on similar
works recently implemented in Ukraine and recent quotations for equipment. Cost estimates for
technical assistance are based on recent actual costs for similar activities. The remaining detailed
designs and supervision costs are estimated at 3-6% of base costs.
2.13         Physical contingencies are estimated at 10%  of base costs for goods, works and
designs. Price contingencies for local costs are based on expected price increases of 15% in 1998,
15% in 1999, 12.5% in 2000, 10% in 2001, 9% in 2002 and 8% in 2003. Price contingencies for
foreign costs are based on an expected price increase of 2.3% per year during the project period. In
total, physical contingencies are estimated at 10% of base cost, and price contingencies are estimated at
about 7 % of base cost plus physical contingencies. To convert local prices to US dollar equivalents, it
is assumed that the divergence between local and foreign price escalation will be corrected by exchange
rate adjustments over the life of the project.

E. Project Financing Arrangements
Financing Plan
2.14         The proposed Bank Loan of US$ 200.0 million (UAH 527.1 million) would finance
about 65 % of total project costs (or 66% of total project costs net of duties). It is expected that the
EBRD would co-finance the project by providing a loan of US$ 40.0 million (UAH 105.4 million)
amounting to about 13% of total project costs (or 13% of total project costs net of duties). As the
activities to be funded by the EBRD loan are an integral part of the project, it was agreed during
negotiations that the EBRD loan should become effective by September 1, 2000, or such date as the
Bank may agree, unless the Borrower establishes that adequate funds for the activities to be funded by
the EBRD loan are available ftom other sources. The remaining 23% of total project cost (UAH 181.5
million) would be provided by project agencies from their own funds or local borrowings. As a
condition for negotiations, Kievenergo demonstrated that its local counterpart contribution would be
provided out of internally generated funds. The financing plan is summarized below in Table 2.2.

a/ Excluding interest during construction estimated at about US$ 45 million to be fmanced by Kievenergo and
about US$ 14 million to be financed by KMDHC.
Flow of Funds and Lending/On-Lending Terms
2.15         The World Bank Loan would be made to Ukraine (represented by the Ministry of
Finance) and on-lent to Kievenergo. The Loan would be made with a maturity of twenty years
including a five year grace period at the LIBOR-based interest rate for US dollar single currency loans.
The Loan would be passed on to Kievenergo as a sub-loan at the same interest rate plus a mark-up of
up to 1 % to be repaid over twenty years, including five years grace on repayment of principal. The
maturity of twenty years allows for a five year grace period, corresponding to the implementation
period of the project, and a repayment period of fifteen years. The foreign exchange risk of the Loan
would be borne by Kievenergo which would also be responsible for the commitment fee. Execution of
a subsidiary loan agreement between Ukraine and Kievenergo would be a condition of effectiveness of
the Loan.
2.16         It is expected that the EBRD loan would be made to Ukraine and on-lent to Kiev
Municipality and its DH company. The EBRD loan would be made to Ukraine at a variable interest
rate of LIBOR + 1 % (about 7.5% currently) with a front-end fee of 1 % for a period of fifteen years,
including five years grace. The EBRD loan would be passed on to Kiev Municipality as a sub-loan at
the EBRD interest rate plus a mark-up of up to 1 % to be repaid over fifteen years, including five years
grace on repayment of principal. The maturity of fifteen years allows for a five year grace period



15
corresponding to the implementation period of the project and a repayment period of ten years. The
EBRD loan would be further on-lent to Kiev Municipal DH Company at the same terms and conditions.
The foreign exchange risk of the EBRD loan would be borne by Kiev Municipality and its DH
company. The processing of the EBRD loan is behind the schedule of the World Bank loan.
Retroactive Financing
2.17         A provision for retroactive financing up to about US$ 7 million has been made for
expenditures incurred after March 1, 1998, primarily for completion of the first phase of the Pozniaki
HOB plant which is urgently needed. This activity is necessary to facilitate heating services in the
Pozniaki area and needs to be undertaken prior to the next heating season.
Inflation and Interest Rates
2.18         Inflation rates in Ukraine, as measured by changes in the Consumer Price Index, were
4,734% in 1993, 891% in 1994, 376% in 1995, 40% in 1996 and 16% in 1997 and are estimated to be
about 15% in 1998, 15% in 1999, 12.5% in 2000, 10% in 2001, 9% in 2002 and 8% per year
thereafter through 2005, reflecting gradual stabilization of the economy. Short-term credit is now
available through the commercial banking system; interest rates on commercial bank loans are
administered by the National Bank of Ukraine and have generally kept ahead of inflation in recent
months. Long-term investment loans, however, are not available in Ukraine today through the
commercial banking system. The interest rates on long-term investment loans to be provided for the
project by the Bank and EBRD are therefore the only available proxies for appropriate interest rates to
be charged to project agencies. The proposed Bank and EBRD lending rates plus a margin of up to 1 %
are considered reasonable. These lending rates are also in line with on-lending interest rates under
other ongoing World Bank and EBRD loans in Ukraine.
F. Implementation Arrangements
2.19         Kievenergo, Kiev Municipality and Kiev Municipal DH Company would be responsible
for implementation of their respective DH components. Kievenergo has appointed its Project Manager
and all the remaining technical and accounting personnel, with satisfactory qualifications, for carrying
out its part of the project, as a condition for negotiations.  Kievenergo would be assisted by
international and local consultants for the tendering process, bid evaluation, contract awards,
supervision of equipment installation and follow-up.
2.20         Kiev Municipal DH Company has also appointed its Project Manager. It is expected
that Kiev Municipality and Kiev Municipal DH Company would nominate the remaining technical and
accounting personnel, with satisfactory qualifications, for carrying out their part of the project prior to
the negotiations of the EBRD loan. Kiev Municipality and Kiev Municipal DH Company would be
assisted by international and local consultants for the tendering process, bid evaluation, contract
awards, supervision of equipment installation and follow-up.
2.21         Project implementation would be expected to begin in late 1998 and would be carried
out over a five and a half year period. The project implementation schedule is included in Annex 4.

Bank-financed) are the amounts financed by the Kiev DH companies and EBRD.
a/     Co-financed in parallel with the EBRD; procured in conformity with World Bank
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995 revised January
and August 1996 and September 1997) for the World Bank-financed part of the project and in
conformity with EBRD Guidelines for Procurement for the EBRD-fmanced part of the project.
bk     Includes intemational shopping (US$ 10.0 million), minor works (US$ 1.0 million), and
consultancy contracts (US$ 0.5 million) procured in conformity with World Bank Guidelines for
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997 revised
September 1997).
2.23           Procurement of goods and works, totaling about 34 packages ranging in value from
US$ 0.3-13.8 million, would follow ICi3 procedures using standard bidding documents according to the
Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published in January 1995
(revised January and August 1996 and September 1997) except that:  (a) international shopping
procedures would be used for small goods purchases ranging in value from US$ 50,000-300,000 for a
total of about US$ 10.0 million (about 3.2% of total procurement); and (b) minor works procurement
procedures would be used for the remaining small works contracts under US $50,000 for a total of
about US$ 1.0 million (about 0.3% of total procurement). The list of Kievenergo's procurement
packages is included in Annex 4. In addition to the procurement workshop held during the appraisal



17
mission, a further procurement workshop would be held during project launch which would explain
thoroughly the procurement process for selected packages in goods, works and consulting services.
2.24         The part of the project being financed by EBRD would follow EBRD procurement
procedures. The EBRD would finance separate contracts on a parallel basis.
2.25          Supply and installation contractors bidding under ICB procedures for contracts above
US$ 10.0 million would be prequalified. Prequalification would be based entirely upon the capability
and resources of prospective bidders to perform the particular contract satisfactorily, taking into
account their (a) experience and past performance on similar contracts, (b) capabilities with respect to
personnel, equipment, and construction or manufacturing facilities, and (c) financial position. For the
prequalification of goods and works, the Bank's standard documentation would be used.
2.26          When ICB procedures are used for goods, qualified domestic manufacturers may be
allowed a preferential margin of 15%, or the existing rate of import duties, whichever is lower, in
accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
2.27          Implementation  support including  consultancy  services  for detailed  designs,
construction supervision, procurement and disbursement, and training in the amount of about US$ 0.3
million as well as financial auditing services in the amount of about US$ 0.2 million would be carried
out by consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be
satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall be selected in accordance with the principles and
procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" published in January 1997 (revised in September 1997). The
engineering consultants (Joseph Technology and Ekono Energy) who carried out the feasibility studies,
technical specifications and initial bid packages would be retained on a sole source basis for
engineering and implementation support in the amount of US$ 0.3 million. Because of the existence of
a large number of local consultants and the necessity of the consultants being familiar with local
conditions and language, the short list of consultants for design and supervision services costing less
than US$ 200,000 shall comprise only local consultants.
2.28          Prior review by the Bank of draft tender documents, including review of bid evaluation
reports and recommendations for contract awards, would be carried out for all ICB procurement. The
list of goods and technical specifications to be procured using international shopping procedures would
be submitted for prior review by the Bank. For international shopping, quotations from a minimum of
three suppliers from at least two World Bank member countries would be required. Some minor goods
and works would be procured using national shopping procedures for which quotations from at least
three firms would be required. All terms of reference for technical assistance contracts would be
subject to prior review. Technical assistance contracts with individuals over US$ 50,000 and with
firms over US$ 100,000 would be subject to prior review. Contracts with individuals and firms under
these amounts would be subject to post review on a selective basis. Overall, the above procurement
plan would result in the Bank's prior review of over 95% of total Bank-financed procurement. To
better ensure that the project will be implemented in a timely manner, as a condition of negotiations,
Kievenergo prepared the draft bidding documents for ICB contracts for the first year of the project and
submitted them to the Bank for review.
2.29         A General Procurement Notice (GPN) was published on April 30, 1997, and an update
has recently been prepared and submitted for publication.

H. Disbursement
2.30         The proceeds of the Bank Loan would be disbursed against:
(a)    100% of foreign expenditures of imported goods, 100% of local expenditures (ex-
factory cost) and 80% of expenditures of other goods obtained locally;
(b)    100% of foreign and 80% of local expenditures for works contracts; and
(c)    100% of foreign and local expenditures for technical assistance and incremental audits.
2.31         The EBRD loan would be disbursed against the KMDHC component of the project in
accordance with EBRD disbursement procedures.
2.32         In the case that grant ftnds can be identified to cover any of the costs of technical
assistance, the Bank Loan allocated to this purpose may be reallocated to other parts of the project, if
needed.
2.33         Disbursement Schedule. The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Annex
5. It is expected that disbursements would be completed in six years by December 31, 2004, about 6
months after completion of equipment supply and installation. A comparison cannot be made to
disbursement profiles for district heating projects, as the few Bank loans made to-date for projects of
this nature are still under implementation. The disbursement schedule is considered realistic, given that
preparation of technical specifications and bidding documents for the first year's procurement activities
were available prior to Loan negotiations.
2.34         Disbursement Documentation. Disbursements for individual consulting contracts of
up to US$ 50,000 equivalent, firm consulting contracts of up to US$ 100,000 equivalent, goods
contracts of up to US$ 300,000 equivalent and works contracts of up to US$ 1 million equivalent would
be made against statements of expenditure (SOE). The supporting documents for these contracts would
not be sent to the Bank but would be retained by Kievenergo for inspection by supervision missions and
by external auditors. Disbursements for all other contracts would be made against standard Bank
documentation.
2.35         Special Account. In order to ensure the timely provision of funds available to finance
small costs of the project, a Special Account in US dollars would be established in a foreign
commercial bank by the Ministry of Finance for Kievenergo in the amount of up to US$ 800,000.
Funds in the Special Account would be available to finance only eligible expenditures under the
project. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation to the Special Account would be
limited to US$ 400,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Loan have reached the
level of US$ 5 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of
US$800,000. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every three months and must
include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents. The minimum
size of a disbursement application for direct payment would be 20% of the current deposit to the
Special Account (US$ 80,000 or US$160,000).  During negotiations, agreement was obtained
regarding the arrangements for establishing and operating the Special Account.

1. Accounts and Audits
Accounting Policies and Revaluation of Assets
2.36         Both Kiev DH companies follow standard, cash-based Soviet accounting requirements
for income tax reporting purposes, based on a unified chart of accounts in effect since 1993. The
financial statements are supplemented by financial indicators based on accrual accounting standards for
management reporting purposes. A draft accounting law is currently under consideration by the
Government and, when approved by the Parliament, would require introduction of international
accounting standards (LAS). For project financial reporting purposes, both Kiev DH companies would
be required to follow IAS.
2.37         Fixed assets are revalued periodically in accordance with Government regulations,
which called for a major increase in values in 1996. Fixed assets are still thought to be undervalued,
but the current assessment is that it would be inappropriate to proceed with a full asset revaluation,
since the actual value that can be given to them, in view of their poor operational efficiency and
outdated technology, are uncertain. Furthermore, raising tariffs to reflect revaluation of assets would
require additional social assistance. Once project investments, which are large relative to current asset
levels, are commissioned, however, the value of assets would be greatly increased and the cost of heat
services would reflect a larger depreciation charge and return on investment as the operational
efficiency of assets is improved.
Project Accounting and Auditing Requirements
2.38         In order to properly record project expenditures, Kievenergo, Kiev Municipality and
Kiev Municipal DH Company would prepare project accounts for their respective parts of the project.
The Kievenergo project account would identify all sources and uses of funds in carrying out its part of
the project, including a detailed accounting of the use of the proceeds of the World Bank Loan. The
Kievenergo project account would be prepared in accordance with IAS and audited by an independent
auditor acceptable to the Bank, and the audit report would be submitted to the Bank within six months
of the end of the fiscal year. This project account audit report would also contain a separate opinion on
the statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure, when utilized, and on the operation of the Kievenergo
Special Account. The Kiev Municipality and Kiev Municipal DH Company project accounts would
similarly be prepared in accordance with IAS and audited by an independent auditor acceptable to
EBRD.
2.39         In order to properly monitor the financial performance of Kievenergo, its financial
statements (income statements and balance sheets), in addition to its project account, would be prepared
in accordance with IAS and audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, and the audit
report would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. The first audit
report would cover Kievenergo's activities for its 1998 fiscal year. The audit report would contain a
separate opinion on compliance by Kievenergo with all financial covenants under the Bank Loan. The
financial statements of Kiev Municipal DH Company, in addition to its project account, would similarly
be prepared in accordance with LAS and audited by an independent auditor acceptable to EBRD. It is
expected that a local branch of a private, international commercial auditor, in association with a local
auditing firm if available, would carry out the audits, and this arrangement is considered acceptable.
During negotiations, agreement was obtained regarding the accounting and auditing requirements of the
project.

J. Environmental Aspects
Environmental Review Process
2.40         Preparation of the proposed project has included environmental studies consistent with
the requirements of the Ukrainian Ministry of Protection of Natural Environment, 1992 Law of
Ukraine for the Protection of the Environment, and the provision of World Bank Operational Directive
4.00 "Environmental Policies."  In accordance with these procedures, an environmental review,
consistent with the requirements for a category "B" project for the boiler houses, CHP plant, DH
piping, Center electric substation and rehabilitation components has been performed. The institutional
support program was placed in category "C" and did not require an environmental analysis. The
findings of the environmental studies and proposed mitigation and monitoring activities are presented
below.
Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures
2.41         Implementation of the proposed project is anticipated to have positive environmental
benefits through improved efficiency in the use of fuels, by contributing to a reduced level of air
pollution in Kiev and by reducing the wastage of water used in the DH system. The specific potential
impacts and mitigation measures for each proposed component are as follows:
2.42         Heat Production Capacity Improvement Componen. During the rehabilitation and
replacement of the boilers, it is likely that insulation materials containing asbestos would be found.
Therefore, a survey is necessary to identify where asbestos is located at the plants. The removal of
asbestos materials should be performed by personnel trained in the appropriate practices. Contractors
or others responsible for boiler works would be required to comply with the regulations of the
European Union. New materials to be used for insulation would not contain asbestos or ozone-
depleting substances.
2.43         All boiler components would increase fuel utilization efficiency. Air pollution in Kiev
is caused almost entirely by industry and automotive exhaust gases and to a very small extent by
emissions from Kievenergo's heat production plant which are fueled mainly by gas. Despite the net
increase in production capacity of the boilers, the emissions of NOR, SO2 and particulates released to
the atmosphere would be substantially reduced from the present levels, since the new plants would
utilize modern technology such as low-NO, burners, flue gas recirculation and a higher stack at the
CT-1 plant in the city center.  The decrease in flue gas emissions would reduce the present
environmental emission fines amounting to about $ 7,000 per month which are paid by Kievenergo to
the Ukrainian Ministry of Protection of Natural Environment. It is recommended that Kievenergo
continues its systematic flue gas monitoring system, employing in-situ stack monitoring technology.
2.44         DH Rehabilitation Component. The DH distribution network and group substation
rehabilitation activities are also expected to involve asbestos removal from the old insulation materials,
requiring similar mitigation measures as for the boilers. The replacement of pipelines and network
components would result in reduced wastage of water, thereby reducing the requirements for water
treatment chemicals and effluents discharge. It is probable that during rehabilitation of the Center
electric substation, traces of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) would be revealed. In this case, the
dielectric oils of the old transformers and circuit breakers would have to be analyzed for PCBs in order
to identify appropriate handling procedures according to the regulations of the European Union. Any
contaminated soils would be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.



21
2.45         Training. Training in environmental issues would be arranged under the project, and
would include the subjects of asbestos and PCB handling, worker health and safety, among other
things.
K. Supervision and Monitoring
2.46         As this is the first Bank-supported DH investment project in Ukraine, a significant
supervision effort would be required particularly during the first two years when a large portion of the
procurement actions would be undertaken. Therefore, it is planned that about 20 staff-weeks of effort
each year for the first two years and about 15 staff-weeks each year thereafter would required for
supervision. A detailed supervision plan will be discussed during negotiations and is attached as Annex
6.
2.47         Kievenergo would prepare semi-annual progress reports which would be submitted to
the Bank within one month after the end of each semester. The progress reports will include, among
other things, information regarding: (a) overall progress of the project, (b) costs for each contract and
for the total project, (c) procurement actions, (d) financial performance, (e) compliance with covenants
under the Loan, (f) issues affecting project implementation and (g) performance monitoring indicators.
The first progress report covering the period ending December 31, 1998 would be sent to the Bank by
end-January 1999. An outline of the proposed format, including the performance indicators, was
discussed during negotiations. The proposed performance monitoring indicators are shown in Annex 7.
2.48         The Bank would carry out a mid-term review of the project not later than September
30, 2001. In addition to the topics covered under the semi-annual progress reports, the mid-term
review would include an in-depth review of the economic viability of the project components, based on
actual costs and benefits achieved to-date, and of the overall institutional and financial viability of
Kievenergo. Based on the outcome of the mid-term review, measures would be taken to ensure the
efficient completion of the project. The timing of the mid-term review was agreed during negotiations.
2.49         An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) would be prepared by the Bank with
inputs from Kievenergo not later than six months after completion of the project. The ICR would
evaluate how well the objectives of the project have been met, the overall performance of the project,
the performance of Kievenergo and lessons learned. During negotiations, agreement was obtained
regarding the reporting and monitoring requirements of the project.

III. IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
A. Kievenergo
Background
3.1          Kievenergo was established as a state-owned, joint-stock company on August 31, 1995,
by transfer of the rights, assets and liabilities of the subdivisions and administration located in Kiev of
the former Kievenergo Energy Production Association. Kievenergo is primarily responsible for the
generation, transportation, distribution and sale of electrical and thermal energy in the City of Kiev.
About 80% of DH supply in Kiev is provided by Kievenergo, which owns and operates the large heat
production plants and transmission networks and sells heat to consumers through substations and
distribution networks owned by Kiev Municipal District Heating Company (KMDHC) to which it pays
a distribution fee. Kievenergo's founder is Minenergo which oversees the Company's activities and
decides on issues related to the major trends of the Company's activities, organizational structure, legal
matters, and appointment of key Company and supervisory personnel, among other things.
Organization and StafFing
3.2          Kievenergo's organizational structure is shown in Chart 1. Minenergo appoints the
General Director, who is in charge of the overall day-to-day management of the Company and acts as
Chairman of the Board. A Supervisory Council, comprised of representatives from Minenergo,
Kievenergo, Kiev Municipality, the State Property Fund and a bank, exercise control over its activities.
The privatization plan for Kievenergo is under implementation and allows for 40.5% of shares to be
owned by company employees and pensioners, employees of state power industry enterprises and other
organizations, 26% of shares to be owned by the state and administered by Minenergo, 30% of shares
to be sold at auction and 3.5% of shares sold at the stock exchange. Kievenergo supervises CHP plants
which provide heat and electricity for Kiev and also take part in the national electricity market. CHP
plants and heating networks of Kievenergo are not subject to privatization and are not included in the
authorized fund of the company. The rights to use these assets are transferred by an agreement to
Kievenergo by Minenergo.
3.3          The Company is comprised of a number of subsidiaries including 2 CHP plants (TETS
5, TETS 6), the Kiev District Heating Facilities Enterprise, Cable Facilities Enterprise, and a number
of maintenance, auto transport, construction and other technical, research and training enterprises. As
of February 1998, Kievenergo employed about 8,400 people in all stages of production, distribution
and utilization of electrical and thermal energy. Kievenergo's management and staff are judged to be
well-qualified, both in the technical and financial areas.
3.4           Personnel training is carried out at a training center, by vocational programs, at a two-
year technical college and Kiev Polytechnic University. Management and marketing training in the
energy field is provided at seminars offered by the Ukrainian-Bavarian Entrepreneurial Center,
International Business Center, and Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, as well as by internships
at industries located in Bavaria, Austria and the United States and recently by study tours to Finland.
During the project period, Kievenergo's management and staff would receive training support in the
areas of procurement and disbursement, introduction of international accounting standards,
computerized billing and environmental issues, among other things.



23
B. Kiev Municipal District Heating Company (KMDHC)
Background
3.5          KMDHC was re-established on July 1, 1992 as a state-municipal enterprise wholly
owned by the City of Kiev. KMDHC is responsible for the production, transportation and distribution
of space heating and domestic hot water to public sector consumers. KMDHC owns and operates 112
heat-only-boiler plant, 2,225 DH substations and about 950 km of underground piping networks in six
heating districts of Kiev City. Most of the heat is supplied by Kievenergo to substations from which
KMDHC distributes the heat to all consumers for a fee. KMDHC generates about 20% of the total city
heat supply at its 112 boiler plants serving small, isolated networks. KMDHC is responsible for billing
only those consumers supplied with heat from its boiler plants.
Organization and Staffing
3.6          KMDHC's organization structure is shown in Chart 2. Kiev City carries out its rights
to manage the enterprise through a board of directors which is the executive body of the enterprise.
Kiev City also appoints the Director, who is in charge of the overall day-to-day management of the
Company.
3.7           The Company is comprised of a number of subsidiaries concerned with district boiler
operations, heating districts operations, automation and control, dispatch and a number of maintenance,
transport, construction and other technical and administrative activities. As of October 1996, KMDHC
employed about 3,945 people. KMDHC's management and staff are judged to be well-qualified, both
in the technical and financial areas. KMDHC's training needs are judged to be similar to Kievenergo's
and a program of support would be developed under the project to be supported by EBRD.
Institutional Structure for DH in Kiev
3.8           The main Kiev DH system is owned and operated by two companies, but it is unclear
as to whether this is the best arrangement for operation of the system in an efficient manner. To assist
in identifying the most efficient institutional and corporate structure for DH, technical assistance is
recommended to be carried out under the project. Draft terms of reference have been developed and
were agreed during Loan negotiations. The technical assistance is expected to review the options of:
(a) existing structure, (b) merger of the two companies, and (c) merger of the distribution networks but
not the isolated networks of KMDHC with Kievenergo. In addition, the technical assistance is
expected to review the opportunities for privatization in heat supply activities and provide
recommendations on ways to encourage private sector participation. Once agreement is reached on the
most appropriate structure, the key steps necessary to legally create the new DH structure and the
minimum conditions to make it operational, including effective management systems, corporate and
operations systems, would be proposed. During negotiations, agreement was obtained with the
Borrower that technical assistance for the review of the institutional and corporate structure for DH in
Kiev would be carried out under the management of Kiev Municipality by consultants in accordance
with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. The study would commence within two years after
Loan effectiveness.

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Past Financial Performance of Project Agencies
4.1          The past financial performance of Kiev DH companies are typically the same since the
onset of the energy price shocks in the early 1990s, although the severity of the problems vary
according to the different structure of activities and consumers of the companies. In general, since the
import prices of fuels (gas and mazut) utilized in DH production increased to world market levels, DH
tariffs have increased dramatically and frequently (e.g., 6 times in 1995) while the growth of incomes
has not kept pace. Due to these large increases in heat charges, consumers have had difficulty in
paying their heat bills on time. A social assistance program targeted to poorer households was
introduced during 1995, but up-to-now has not been fully effective in reducing arrears from these
consumers, partly because of the limited ability of the social assistance offices to cope with the large
increase in applications for social assistance and partly due to insufficient funding at the local level to
support the program. As a result, DH companies have been experiencing serious cash flow problems
and consequently have been unable to pay their suppliers (mainly fuel suppliers) on time. While DH
companies have made heroic efforts to raise DH tariffs to cost recovery levels, tariff levels have, up-to-
now, been insufficient to allow for adequate maintenance and necessary repairs, let alone new
investments. This performance demonstrates the need to reduce heat production and operating costs
through efficient investments and for more effective social assistance schemes for households to permit
them to better pay for heat services.
4.2          The past and present financial performance of Kievenergo (since its establishment in
end-August 1995) and KMDHC, restated on an accrual basis, for 1995-97 are shown in detail in
Annexes 8 and 9, respectively, and the financial highlights of Kievenergo and KMDHC are shown in
Table 4.1 below. The financial statements show that the two Kiev DH enterprises had gross sales in
1997 of about $ 505 million, about 94% of which is attributable to Kievenergo's heat and electricity
activities, demonstrating Kievenergo's dominance in the provision of DH in the main system in Kiev.
Both DH enterprises showed profits on operations during 1995-97. Despite the cash flow difficulties,
neither DH company has any significant long-term debt; Kievenergo has only one small outstanding
loan associated with the Pozniaki project in the amount of about $ 1.2 million which will be repaid
during 1998-99. The lack of any significant long-term borrowings would allow for adequate debt
servicing capacity for the project loans, with the lowest debt service coverage ratio projected to be 4.5
in 2003, well above the minimum advisable ratio of 1.5. The proposed investment project of about
$ 300 million, while large in absolute terms, represents less than one year of sales and only a small
fraction of the roughly estimated current replacement value of more than $ 3.3 billion of the main DH
assets. The proposed investments are urgently needed to protect and prevent further corrosion of these
sizable assets.

* Since Kievenergo's establishment on August 31, 1995.
B. Heat Tariffs
4.3           Since the onset of the energy fuel price increases after independence, the Government
has made substantial efforts to raise the overall levels of heat tariffs in Kiev to keep pace with the rapid
rise in heat production and operating costs, as shown for the period 1994-98 in Table 4.2 below. As
mentioned above, heat in the main DH system in Kiev is primarily provided by Kievenergo which
produces and supplies heat through substations and distribution network-s of KMDHC. Average DH
tariffs for customers served by these two DH companies are established according to a methodology
recommended by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers and approved by Kiev City Government and
which takes into account both companies' costs associated with the main DH system, including
production costs, transmission and distribution costs, operations and maintenance costs, depreciation,
interest and a profit margin. KMDHC also produces and supplies heat in small isolated networks for
which DH tariff levels follow the same methodology. Today, the average DH tariff for the customers
of the main system is about $17.7/Gcal. During negotiations, agreement was obtained that Kiev
Municipality would adjust heat tariffs on a regular basis to allow Kievenergo to cover the costs of
production, transmission and distribution, operations and maintenance, depreciation, interest, and make
an adequate contribution to reserves.  During negotiations, agreement was also obtained that
Kievenergo would continue to request Kiev Municipality to adjust its heat tariffs to cover the costs of
production, transmission and distribution, operations and maintenance, depreciation, interest, and make
an adequate contribution to reserves. The analysis of heat tariff increases would be carried out at the
beginning of each heating season to determine the rate of the next increase.

26
4.4           Although the average levels of heat tariffs for the two Kiev DH companies were
sufficient to cover costs (except depreciation based on replacement values) in recent years, the tariff
structures were facing a number of problems. First, the tariff structures for both DH companies
included cross-subsidies from industrial consumers to residential consumers. Second, the cost of heat
produced from CHP plants was higher than in HOB plants, based on the principles of cost allocation,
while it would be expected that heat produced from CHP plants would be lower in cost. Third, the
tariff structure contained only an energy charge rather than a two-tier structure with fixed and variable
components that would allow for more transparent information about the marginal cost of heat supply
from the DH system. Fourth, existing consumers covered the cost of connecting new consumers to the
DH service. In addition, the tariff levels with depreciation based on fixed asset values, which are
thought to be below replacement values, and on very long economic lives (about 75 years on average)
was making it difficult for DH enterprises to renew DH assets on a self-financing basis.
4.5           In order to address the problems mentioned above with the heat tariff structure and
levels, technical assistance was requested by Kievenergo for a heat tariff study which commenced in
March 1997 under terms of reference agreed with the Bank and under funding from Kievenergo and a
grant secured from the Finnish Government. Kievenergo and Kiev Municipality have already started
implementing the findings of the study. In particular, cross-subsidies have been eliminated with tariffs
for all consumer groups now established at levels covering costs (only profit margins vary). During
negotiations, agreement was obtained that Kiev Municipality would maintain the heat tariff structure of
Kievenergo without cross-subsidies between the different categories of consumers.  Furthermore,
depreciation is now based on an average life of DH assets about 35 years, and the cost allocation
formula for pricing heat and electricity from CHP plants has been changed to allow for some of the co-
generation benefits to be shared with the heat consumers. As a result, the average heat tariff in the
main DH system has decreased from its highest level during early 1997 of about US$22/Gcal to today's
level of about US$17.77/Gcal. Actions are also underway to start the process for introduction of a
two-tier tariff with fixed and variable charges beginning with the 1998/99 heating season. These
significant steps undertaken by Kievenergo and Kiev Municipality during the project preparation period
underscore the importance being given to improving the affordability and viability of the DH service in
the capital city of Kiev.
C. Electricity Tariffs
4.6           As for heat tariffs, the Government has recently made substantial efforts to raise
electricity tariffs to cover the operating costs of the power industry, including Kievenergo. Increases
during 1995-96 have brought the average electricity price (US cent 3.8/kWh equivalent in November
1996) close to the economic cost of electricity (US cent 4.1/kWh) 2 Kievenergo's prices are in line
with the industry's prices, although its average tariff (US cent 2.4/kWh in 1995) is somewhat below the
average for the industry as a whole (US cent 2.9/kWh in 1995) due to its particular composition of
customers and the lower costs of producing electricity from its CHP plants. Table 4.3 below shows
Kievenergo's electricity tariffs during the period 1994-98.
Z/ The low economic cost (in international comparison) is explained by decreasing electricity demand resulting in
surplus generation, transmission and distribution capacity.

* including discounts given to privileged consumers (e.g., veterans, Chernobyl victims, etc.)
4.7           Electricity tariffs previously included substantial cross-subsidies from  industrial to
residential consumers. From January 1998, the nationwide electricity tariff for non-privileged urban
household consumers was increased to about US cents 4.7/kWh, which is above the level of the
electricity tariffs for industrial consumers, substantially reducing the cross-subsidy. However, the tariff
for Kievenergo's other category of household consumer (i.e., households with electric stoves and
heaters for which the tariff is US cents 2.9/kWh) is still below economic cost. In order to ensure the
rational use of electricity and to reduce the cross-subsidy, electricity distribution companies, including
Kievenergo, are to set the average household electricity price (before discounts) at least 20% higher
than the average industrial price by end-1997 and maintain the average household electricity price
above the average industrial price by this percentage over the project period.  Assuming 1996
consumption levels for the different household and industrial consumer categories, Kievenergo's
average household electricity price (before discounts) is already 24% higher than the average industrial
electricity price. Adjustments to the average household electricity tariff would therefore be needed
only when industrial tariffs are adjusted.
4.8           Part of the difference between the average electricity price and the economic cost is due
to discounts given to some privileged residential consumers, including veterans, Chernobyl victims and
military personnel, representing about one-third of residential consumers. These discounts impose a
large financial burden on the distribution companies and create incentives for uneconomic use of
electricity. Taking into account that the discounts cannot be eliminated abruptly, the Government has
decided to introduce a norm (i.e., a lifeline consumption level) above which consumption would be
billed at the regular price, thereby reducing the cost of the discounts. In accordance with Cabinet of
Ministers Resolution No. 879, dated August 1, 1996, electricity distribution companies, including
Kievenergo, are to limit the discounts applicable to residential consumers to the consumption norms
specified.
4.9           Historically, regulation of retail electricity prices was carried out by the Ministry of
Economy, but this task has been taken over in 1996 by the National Electricity Regulatory Commission
(NERC). A new methodology for the calculation of retail electricity tariffs is incorporated in the
licenses that have been recently issued by NERC to regulated suppliers, including Kievenergo. The



28
methodology allows for the full pass-through of the wholesale tariff and full recovery of the costs of
distribution and supply in the retail tariffs. During negotiations, agreement was obtained that the
Borrower would cause NERC to regulate electricity tariffs for Kievenergo in a manner that would
enable Kievenergo to maintain satisfactory financial performance (e.g., adequate debt service coverage
and current ratio). During negotiations, agreement was also obtained that Kievenergo continue to
request NERC to regulate electricity tariffs at such levels that would enable Kievenergo to maintain
satisfactory financial performance.
D. Billing and Collection Performance of Project Agencies
4.10          Billing.  Kievenergo and KMDHC  contract with municipal house maintenance
companies, known as zheks, to prepare bills and collect payments for heat and hot water services from
residential consumers. Due to the limited metering of heat production plants and consumption, the
costs of heat production and operation are attributed to each building according to estimated
consumption in the building, and in the case of apartment buildings, divided among households based
on square meters for heat services and on the number of persons for hot water services. Zheks also
adjust the bills of residential consumers for any discounts that may be applicable under the social
assistance program. Bills for heating and hot water are added to household charges for rent and other
utilities for the residential consumers for payment on a monthly basis. While this system of billing
provides an incentive for consumers to install heat meters since heat losses are paid by the non-metered
consumers, few residential consumers have the ability to pay for the installation of meters. Metering of
production plant and consumer substations would be improved under the project.
4.11          Budgetary and industrial consumers, on the other hand, are typically metered, and
billing is made directly (except for small budgetary organizations which are sometimes billed through
zheks) and based on actual consumption of heat, hot water and steam, carried out monthly for
budgetary organizations and every 10 days for industrial consumers. Kievenergo's electricity service
for all consumer groups is metered, but since meters are not read for residential consumers on a
monthly basis, each household reports the quantity of electricity consumed and pays its bill to
commercial banks which charge Kievenergo a 7% commission for handling the utility payments. Since
early 1998, Kievenergo has been working on improving electricity consumption and payment records,
with the introduction of an automated data processing system under an agreement with the firm UNION
FENOSA (Spain).
4.12          Collection Performance.  Collection performance of heat bills by Kievenergo and
KMDHC and electricity bills by Kievenergo deteriorated during the past years. Due to the large rise in
heat and electricity tariffs relative to the growth of incomes, especially during 1994/95, many
consumers were not able to pay their bills on time, causing a large build-up of accounts receivables by
Kievenergo of about 1 1/2 years at June 1995. During 1996, Kievenergo substantially improved the
collection of heat and electricity bills from its consumers, but the overall level of accounts receivables
was still high at January 1, 1997 at about 195 days of billings or about $ 229 million. During 1997,
arrears, particularly of budgetary organizations, increased. In accordance with a Cabinet of Ministers
Decree, arrears of budgetary organizations prior to January 1, 1998, are being restructured to be repaid
over five years. In order to improve future payment performance of budgetary organizations, the
Government and municipalities have now started implementing line-item budgeting for utility bills.
After restructuring of arrears of budgetary organizations, overall accounts receivables at January 1,
1998, were at about 175 days. About 90% of Kievenergo's accounts receivables are from its heat and
hot water customers.
4.13         After the restructuring of the debts of budgetary organizations, municipal zheks are
currently responsible for the bulk (82%) of the receivables to Kievenergo. Taxes owed by Kievenergo



29
during th.e year are estimated to be sufficient to allow for the cancellation of a significant share of
accounts receivables of budgetary organizations, and offsets are typically used to settle accounts with
budgetary organizations. Industrial consumers are subject to penalties (0.75%/day) and disconnections,
and rescheduling of payments has been agreed for many industrial consumers in arrears. The greatest
difficulty therefore concerns collections of bills from residential consumers through zheks.
4.14          The high level of Kievenergo's accounts receivables for heat and hot water consumers
is partly due to the billing practice of zheks, which allows residential consumers to pay for their heat
and hot water services equally each month throughout the year despite the higher consumption levels in
the winter months. In addition, Kiev Municipality's failure to transfer all the financial resources to
Kievenergo to cover the approved discounts for heating and hot water services applied by zheks under
the social assistance program adds to the high level of accounts receivables. In 1996, for example, the
service providers in Kiev received only 35% of the funds required to cover discounts to consumers,
although this improved somewhat during 1997 to about 50%. Since Kievenergo does not maintain the
individual payment records of residential consumers which are maintained by the zheks and does not
know the level of discounts granted by the local authority, it is not in a position to identify the portion
of its accounts receivables attributable to Kiev Municipality for its overdue social assistance payments.
4.15          In order to address this problem, Kievenergo initiated, during 1997, a pilot scheme in
three districts of Kiev whereby households are required to pay directly to Kievenergo, and the early
results are encouraging. After a trial period, Kievenergo may introduce the direct payment approach in
the other districts, and this would be expected to improve the collection of heat bills from households.
Kievenergo is also taking other steps to improve collections, including the establishment since January
1997 of a special unit to fo!io!w-up on collections. It has further introduced a consumer services
department and is undertaking public relations campaigns. Support for computerization of consumer
accounts would also be provided under the project. Kievenergo's accounts receivables position by
consumer group as of January 1, 1998 is shown in Table 4.4 below.

4.16          KMDHC is also experiencing an unusually high level of accounts receivables. As of
January 1, 1997, its overall level of receivables was at about 330 days of billings or about $ 27 million.
Again, budgetary organizations and zheks are responsible for the bulk (85%) of the receivables.
KMDHC has also restructured the debts of budgetary organizations.  KMDHC  is working on
improving collections from residential consumers and initiated a similar pilot scheme during 1997 to
collect directly from residential consumers.



30
4.17          Payments from consumers for heating and electricity services are made in cash only.
Payments in the form of barter, promissory notes, bonds and other forms of securities are not accepted
in Kiev despite the widespread barter practices and pledges that have prevailed elsewhere in Ukraine's
energy sector.
4.18         The overall levels of accounts receivables should be reduced further before project
agencies would be in a position to demonstrate their ability to adequately collect from consumers in
order to repay their respective loans. Therefore, as a condition for negotiations, Kievenergo reduced
its overall accounts receivables by about 20 days to 175 days. Collection performance in 1998 and
thereafter is expected to improve as a result of further efforts being taken by the project agencies to
collect from consumers, especially residential consumers, as well as further support being provided to
the social assistance program. During negotiations, agreement was obtained that Kievenergo would
maintain and further reduce its overall accounts receivables, excluding accounts receivables for
budgetary organizations prior to January 1, 1998 which have been restructured, to 175 days by end-
1998, 150 days by end-1999, 130 days by end-2000, 110 days by end-2001, 90 days by end-2002 and
70 days each year thereafter. Targets are also expected to be established for KMDHC under the EBRD
loan.
E. Future Financial Performance of Project Agencies
4.19          Kievenergo. Projections of financial performance of Kievenergo over the period 1998-
2003 are shown in Annex 8. The financial projections include a forecast of Kievenergo's income
statements, sources and applications of funds statements and balance sheets along with financial
performance indicators. The projections have been prepared on a conservative basis assuming that:
(a)    heat demand in the main DH system would increase over the project period in
accordance with a conservative scenario of residential, industrial and public growth and
would consider increases in production capacity and improvements in service levels and
likely energy conservation measures (see Annex 1);
(b)    electricity demand in Kiev would remain flat during the period 1998-2003;
(c)   the same mix of fuels (mainly gas) would be used over the near term and fuel prices,
which are at world market levels, would increase with international inflation;
(d)    collection performance would gradually improve in accordance with covenanted targets
(see para 4.18) allowing for a similar gradual improvement in payment performance to
suppliers; and
(e)   the World Bank loan would be at an interest rate of 8%, with a maturity of 20 years,
including a 5-year grace period.
4.20          The forecast for Kievenergo considers its investment costs and also the distribution fee
it would pay to KMDHC to cover the costs of distribution in the main DH system, including the costs
associated with the new investments being undertaken by KMDHC. The forecast shows that the project
investments, which would bring about efficiency improvements and increased sales, would have a
positive impact on heat tariffs, since the average heat tariff would need to increase at rates below
expected domestic inflation over the project period. With the current and proposed increases in tariffs
during the project period, Kievenergo would be able to generate the counterpart contribution to the
project investment costs and maintain satisfactory financial performance, with a satisfactory operating
ratio (averaging about 87% over the project period) and adequate working capital (current ratio above



31
1.2 after 1998) and debt service coverage (well above the minimum advisable of_ 1.5). Kievenergo
would also begin to build up cash reserves for future investments during the latter years of the project
period. In order to protect its financial position, during negotiations, agreement was obtained that
Kievenergo maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 during the project period. In order to
ensure adequate liquidity, agreement was obtained during negotiations that Kievenergo maintain a
current ratio of at least 1.2 during the project period. To properly monitor financial performance,
during negotiations, agreement was obtained that Kievenergo prepares a report annually on or about
March 31, beginning in FY99, for each year during project implementation containing financial
projections for the upcoming year to be reviewed by the Bank.
4.21          Kiev Municipal District Heating Company. Projections of financial performance of
KMDHC over the period 1997-2002 are shown in Annex 9. The financial projections include a
forecast of KMDHC's income statements, sources and applications of funds statements and balance
sheets along with financial performance indicators for its operations in isolated networks.  Since
KMDHC's financial statements include its performance related to the isolated networks but only report
on its net profit on operations in the main DH system, a fuller forecast of KMDHC's sources and
application of funds statements associated with its operations in the main DH system has also been
prepared. The projections have been prepared on a conservative basis assuming that:
(a)    heat sales in KMDHC's isolated networks would remain at the same level as in 1996;
(b)   the same mix of fuels (mainly gas) would be used over the near term and fuel prices,
which are at world market levels, would increase with international inflation;
(c)    collection performance would gradually improve in accordance with targets to be
agreed with EBRD allowing for a similar gradual improvement in payment
performance to suppliers; and
(d)   the EBRD loan would be at an interest rate of 10%, with a maturity of 15 years,
including a 5-year grace period.
4.22          The forecast for KMDHC's operations in isolated networks, which have higher unit
costs, lower efficiency and lower heat load densities than the main system, shows that the average heat
tariff would need to increase by about 20% in 1998 and by about 5% each year during 2000-2003.
These rates of tariff increases are below the overall rates of domestic inflation over the project period.
With the proposed tariff increases, KMDHC would be able to maintain satisfactory financial
performance, with an operating ratio averaging about 78% over the project period and adequate
working capital (current ratio above 1.3). KMDHC would also begin to build up cash reserves for
future investments during the latter years of the project period. It is expected that during negotiations
of the EBRD loan, agreement would be sought that KMDHC maintain an adequate debt service
coverage ratio and an adequate current ratio during the project period. To properly monitor financial
performance, during negotiations of the EBRD loan, it is also expected that agreement would be sought
that KMDHC prepares a report annually containing financial projections for the upcoming year
beginning in end-FY99 to be reviewed by the EBRD on an annual basis.
4.23          The forecast of KMDHC's sources and applications of funds statements for its
operations in the main system shows that, with a share of loan financing of about 75% and with the
distribution fee covering its costs including an adequate profit margin of about 14%, KMDHC would
be able to generate the counterpart contribution for this part of the project investment costs and
maintain satisfactory financial performance.  In order to better ensure satisfactory financial
performance, as a condition of negotiations, Kievenergo settled the outstanding amount (about UAH 7
million) as of January 1, 1997, of its distribution fee to KMDHC. In addition, during negotiations,



32
agreement was obtained that Kievenergo would continue to pay a distribution fee to KMDHC in a
timely manner to cover KMDHC's costs of distribution. Further agreement was reached during
negotiations that, at the time of signature of the EBRD loan, any outstanding amounts of the
distribution fee would be restructured according to an agreement with KMDHC to be repaid within
one year. Agreement is also expected to be sought during negotiations of the EBRD loan that Kiev
Municipality would continue to approve regular increases of KMDHC's distribution fee sufficient to
allow KMDHC to cover its costs of distribution, including operations and maintenance costs, interest,
depreciation, and an adequate profit margin.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION, RISKS AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
A. Project Justification
Summary
5.1           The proposed project would have significant economic benefits for Ukraine related to
savings from the improved efficiency of the DH system, the avoidance of a demand deficit and the
improvement of space heating and hot water service levels and reliability in the capital city of Kiev.
The project would also have substantial financial benefits for the heat utilities related to fuel and
operational cost savings and increases in sales revenue.
5.2           For the purposes of the economic analysis, the project has been grouped into 9
economically independent components.3  Each component has been subjected to a least cost analysis,
particularly those including expansion of DH capacity, verifying in all cases that the proposed
investments are the least cost options. The economic analysis shows that all the proposed components
are justified. The overall economic rate of return (ERR) of the project is about 20%, with an economic
net present value (NPV) of $ 160.4 million discounted at the opportunity cost of capital of 10% and a
weighted average benefit to cost (B/C) ratio of 1.3. Sensitivity and risk analyses were also undertaken,
and the results indicate that the ERRs are quite robust and have a high overall likelihood of about 50%
of being achieved. The results of the economic analysis are summarized in Table 5.1 below, presented
in descending order of B/C ratios.

the project slightly lower than the ERR at about 16%. A distributional analysis was also undertaken
which indicates that a significant share of about 32% of the project net benefits would help lower
income households, while about 36% of the net benefits would help the Government in the form of

added fiscal revenue. The assumptions for calculating the economic and financial indicators for the
various components are described following and elaborated in Annex 10.
Least-Cost Analysis
5.4           The proposed expansion of DH heat production capacities at the various boiler plants
has been compared to the option of decentralizing heat supply to buildings by installing individual gas
boilers and has been clearly demonstrated to be the least-cost option in each case. This result is largely
explained by the high heat load densities in project areas in the main interconnected DH system (5.9
Gcal/h per km of network as compared to 2.7 Gcal/h per km of network in Helsinki) and the higher
efficiencies of the large DH boilers relative to the smaller decentralized boilers (90% versus 75%
respectively).
5.5          In addition, a simplified model for Kiev has been developed for evaluating the costs of
the two green field options based on Western technology of centralized heating as compared with a
decentralized heating option. The model compares the costs of two centralized heating options (a)
where heat is produced from gas-fired HOBs and (b) where heat is produced at zero cost where no
sunk costs for any equipment or pipeline exist with the costs of (c) individual gas boilers where it is
assumed that existing gas networks reach every building. The model compares the long-run costs at the
user level of (a) a gas-fired centralized HOB plant with hot water DH network, automated substations
and metering, (b) a centralized HOB plant with hot water DH network, automated substations and
metering, where the heat cost at the generation plant is zero, and (c) independent gas-fired boilers
located in buildings. The model assumes a capital cost of 10%, technical life of 20 years for all
options, centralized boiler cost of $ 60,000/Gcal/h, DH network and substation cost of $ 487,000 per
km per Gcal/h, gas network cost of $ 12,000/Gcal/h (including reinforcing of the present gas network
for building-level boilers, typical (300 m) connection lines to buildings, pressure regulators and gas
meters), individual boiler cost of $ 116,000/Gcal/h (including installation and construction work
required for two boiler units to achieve the required reliability and to be consistent with the building
code), DH network losses of 8%, operating and maintenance costs of 1.5% and 3% of capital costs for
centralized and decentralized heating systems respectively, a gas price of about $ 82.4/1,000 m3 or
$10.20/Gcal, and a peak load duration of 2,200 hours. The model results are summarized in Figure
5.1 below.
Used for comparison purposes for providing the absolute lower limnit below which no centralized heat source
(whether based on inexpensive or waste fuel, co-generation, free heat from waste incineration or CHP, etc.) can
be less expensive than heat from individual boilers in buildings.

Heat Load Density (GcalIh per km of network)
5.6           The results show that, for high head load densities of more than 4 Gcal/h per km of
network, centralized DH production at HOB and/or CHP plants is the preferred option. Where heat
load densities are between 1 Gcal/h per km and 4 Gcal/h per km, a detailed analysis would be needed
using actual fuel and heat production costs at the plant to determine the preferred option. Where heat
load densities are below 1 Gcal/h per km, decentralized individual boilers are the preferred option. As
mentioned above, Kiev has a high concentration of heat demand per km of primary network at about
5.9 Gcal/h per km. With a population close to 3 million, it requires heat to serve the demand for hot
water, space and ventilation heating for about 50 million rn2 of residential buildings and about 25
million m2 of public and commercial buildings. Almost all households live in apartment buildings,
more than 90% of which have at least five floors. Industry demands heat for the same purposes and for
industrial processes, and there are more than 1,000 industrial, construction, transportation and storage
facilities in the city. For the proposed boiler components located in the dense built-up areas of the city
where a large share of DH investments in plant and networks are already in place, the case for
preservation and expansion of DH is even stronger and is estimated to be closer to the centralized
option with zero fuel cost.
5.7           The option of constructing new CHP capacity as an alternative to HOB capacity was
also considered. However, in the present power situation in Ukraine whereby electricity capacity is
currently underutilized and this situation is expected to last until at least 2007, constructing new power
production capacity at this time would be premature. When electricity demand grows and new CHP
capacity is built in the distant future, the present HOB investments could be utilized as peak load and
reserve sources.
5.8           Other components of the project have also been subjected to a least-cost analysis.
Table 5.2 below summarizes the results of the least-cost analysis for three key components which have
been compared with the option of decentralized gas boilers. The analysis considered the capital and
operating costs of the components and the decentralized alternatives and discounted the costs using the
opportunity cost of capital for Ukraine. Given the existing sunk costs and the high heat load densities
in Kiev, the components constitute in all cases the least-cost options. The detailed analysis used in the
comparison of alternatives is presented in Annex 10.

Economic Analysis
5.9          The economic analysis compares the economic costs of each project component with its
economic benefits. All costs and benefits are valued at early 1998 border prices and are incremental in
nature. The economic analysis considers the difference between the cost and benefits for each project
component "with the project" and "without the project," over the minimum life of the investments of
20 years for each component. Shadow prices for foreign exchange and labor costs are not required for
the economic analysis. An exchange rate conversion factor to compensate for price distortions related
to trade or other barriers is not needed, since the current exchange rate is judged to be a market-
clearing rate. Similarly, since real wage rates have proved to be fairly flexible and have declined in
line with declining national product, no conversion factor for labor costs is required.
5.10         The investment costs for each of the project components include equipment and
installation costs, including design and supervision costs and physical contingencies. The costs of
technical assistance have been included proportionally as part of the investment costs for each
component, since technical assistance includes support to strengthen the procurement, construction
supervision and institutional capacity of project agencies and is considered necessary for the overall
success of the project. The variable costs include fuel costs, operation, repair and maintenance costs as
well as losses. For the boiler components, fuel costs were estimated based on the international price of
natural gas as forecasted by the World Bank for Europe and adjusted for Ukrainian transport costs to
the boiler houses ($82.4/1,000 m3). All costs have been adjusted to exclude taxes, duties and estimated
inflation costs.
5.11          The five major boiler plant components at CT-1, CT-2, TETS 5, TETS 6 and Pozniaki,
which include replacement of old worn out boilers and/or expansion of the capacity of the boiler
houses, would all increase the available capacity of heat, thereby avoiding a deficit in demand and
increasing the DH service levels in these areas. Similarly, the Center electric substation would increase
the available capacity of electricity in the city center thereby ensuring an adequate supply of electricity
for DH pumping stations and boiler plant.  The economic benefits of these increased capacity
investments have been based on estimates of what consumers would be willing to pay to avoid the
deficit, using the proxy of the incremental sales revenues and the estimated consumer surplus. In the
calculations, a price elasticity of demand of -0.5 was assumed. A more detailed explanation of the
calculation of willingness to pay is presented in Annex 10.
5.12         The boiler plant components at CT-1, CT-2, TETS 5 and TETS 6 also include
rehabilitation of other boilers and introduction of variable speed pumps. These components would
result in higher efficiency in heat production with lower fuel, operating (including electricity costs
related to pumping) and maintenance costs. After rehabilitation, boiler efficiencies at CT-1 and CT-2
would increase from 75% to 95% and at TETS 5 and TETS 6, from 89% to 95%. At TETS 5, the
water treatment plant would also be reconstructed, resulting in less corrosion and hence extended life of
pipeline networks and boilers and reduced maintenance costs and repairs. Further unquantifiable



37
benefits would result from reduced emissions of SO2, NO, and particulates resulting from the
introduction of modem technology including low-NO, burners, flue gas recirculation and the higher
stack at CT-1.
5.13          The main economic benefits of the substantial program of replacement of transmission
and distribution pipelines and valves were derived from reduced heat and water losses in the networks,
reduced repair and maintenance costs and improved reliability of the heating service, which is subject
to frequent breakdowns, as evidenced during the past several winters. The pipeline sections to be
replaced currently cause outages at a rate twice as high as the average for the whole network of about
220 hours per year. Replacement of these pipelines would be expected therefore to save 220 hours of
interrupted service, which has been valued at $65/Gcal considering the cost of alternative electric
heaters.
5.14         The main benefits of the substation investments have been derived from estimates of
reductions in heat requirements for the same service levels resulting from efficiency improvements in
the substations and better controls, reduced heat and water losses, and reduced repair and maintenance
costs.
5.15         A summary of the present values of the benefits of each component by type of benefit is
presented in Table 5.3. The table shows that the component with the highest present value of benefits
is the Pozniaki boiler component, followed by the TETS 6 rehabilitation and expansion component.
Further unquantifiable benefits would result from the generation of professional and technical
employment required for the design, fabrication and installation of equipment.

Project Financial Analysis
5.16         The financial analysis includes a discounted cash flow analysis for each project
component from the point of view of the DH companies, the key project beneficiaries. The cost
streams include all the costs the DH companies would incur, which are the costs used in the economic



38
analysis, plus taxes and duties. Among the taxes are a 25% social overhead on labor applicable to
construction and operating and maintenance (O&M) costs for each component, a 20% VAT on fuel
transport costs, water treatment chemicals and local supplies, and a 2% import duty on foreign
materials. The benefit streams include the additional sales revenue and the cost savings from the
reduction in losses, fuel used and O&M requirements. The results of the financial analysis are
presented in Table 5.4 below. The component with the highest financial net present value (FNPV) is
CT-1 boiler plant rehabilitation and expansion at $ 39 million and the lowest is Center electric
substation with a FNPV of $ 3 million. The project has an overall FNPV of $ 110 million and a FRR
of about 16%.

Sensitivity Analysis
5.17         A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the robustness of the ERRs of each project
component to changes in key variables in the cost and benefit streams, such as investment costs, repair
and maintenance costs and willingness to pay, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. The results
indicate that the proposed investments have attractive and robust economic indicators, as only with very
large increases in investment costs or substantial decreases in benefits would the ERRs fall to levels
below the opportunity cost of capital of about 10%. A summary of the changes in the cost and benefit
streams of each component that would be required for the ERRs to fall below 10% is presented in
Table 5.5 below.

5.18            As Pozniaki DH boiler plant component is the largest component of the project, the
results of its sensitivity analysis are displayed separately in Figure 5.2. The graph shows that
investment costs would need to increase by more than 40%, running costs, including fuel and
operational costs, would need to increase by more than 20%, or the heat tariff would need to decline by
more than 12% before the ERR drops below the opportunity cost of capital of 10%. The point where
the curves intersect corresponds to the ERR of Pozniaki of 15.5%.

Distributional Analysis
5.19            A  distributional analysis of how cost and benefits are allocated among the different
project stakeholders, specifically the poor and the Government, was also undertaken. The poor
households, those in the lowest income quartile, would be expected to benefit from employment
opportunities for unskilled labor during the construction period of the project and receive a net increase
in incomes. Poor users are also expected to benefit from the reduction in supply shortages and
improvement in supply reliability. Low income households cannot compensate for the lack of heat as
better-off households can. They therefore experience significant personal costs related to health and



40
consequent loss of income due to inadequate heating and hot water service levels. The project is
expected to reduce these disadvantages, resulting in an increase in the consumers surplus of low income
users. The Government is expected to benefit from the additional tax revenues generated by the project
from import duties, VAT on project expenditures and social taxes on labor. DH utilities are also
expected to gain from the net increase in sales revenue, the reduction of fuel costs and system losses,
and the savings in operations and maintenance expenses.  Table 5.6. presents the results of the
distributional analysis. The table shows that about 32% of the net benefits would help the poor, with a
58% certainty, and about 36% of the benefits would help the Government, with a 62% certainty.
Based on a risk analysis, it was estimated with a 75 % certainty that about 29 % of the net benefits of the
project would help the poor, while another 26% would help the Government.

B. Risk Analysis and Project Risks
Risk Analysis
5.20          Projects in Ukraine face a considerable degree of risk. Part of the risk is associated
with the macroeconomic and political uncertainties facing all transition economies. Another part is
specific to the project, and for this part a risk analysis was carried out to estimate the likelihood that
certain risks, such as project delays, cost increases, lower avoided demand deficits and lower boiler
efficiencies, for example, would materialize and have an adverse impact on the economic indicators of
the project. More specifically, risk analysis enables the assignment of probability distributions to the
different input variables, key parameters and assumptions of the spreadsheet cost benefit model so that
a weighted expected NPV and ERR can be estimated. Based on the risk distributions for each variable,



41
the cost benefit model was subjected to a random Monte Carlo simulation with 1,000 trials, estimating
the probability of occurrence for each component's NPV and ERR. Based on this analysis, the ERRs
that could be achieved for each project component with a 75% certainty were estimated. These results
are summarized in Table 5.7 below, while Annex 10 presents the detailed assumptions utilized in the
risk analysis. For the project as a whole, an ERR of about 17 % with a 75 % certainty can be expected.

Project Risks
5.21          Being the first DH investment project in Ukraine, the project faces a number of risks,
which need to be properly mitigated to reduce the probability of uneconomic outcomes. These risks
are presented along with proposed mitigation measures in Table 5.8 below:

In addition, bidding documents for the first year's

consumers' heat bills will increase.              Monitoring performance in this area would also be a
key focus of attention during supervision of the
project.
C. Social Impacts
5.22           A social assessment, to appraise the impacts of the lack of adequate heat and hot water
on residential DH consumers in Kiev, was carried out during the appraisal of the project. The social
assessment was based on (a) structured in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with residential
DH consumers and (b) a survey administered to 365 households in Kiev. The key issues addressed
from the point of view of residential consumers in apartment buildings included: (a) quality and
reliability of the provision of heat and hot water, (b) level of satisfaction and hardships due to
insufficient provision of heat and hot water, (c) patterns of supplementary heating and other coping
strategies, (d) expenditures for district heat and hot water by different income groups, (e) metering, (f)
collections, (g) cost recovery, (h) affordability and willingness to pay, (i) willingness to insulate and
reduce heat losses, (j) willingness to save hot water, and (k) effectiveness of the means-tested housing
and communal services social assistance program targeted to low-income households. The key findings
of the social assessment are summarized below and elaborated in Annex 11.



43
5.23          Quality of DH and Hot Water Services and Coping Strategies. Special emphasis in
the Kiev survey was placed on evaluating the low levels of DH and hot water services and how the low
service levels affect the poorer (defined as the 25% of households with the lowest per capita
expenditures) and vulnerable segments of the population as compared to the better off groups. The
survey confirmed that more than three-fourths of households considered the room temperature in their
apartments to be too cold during winter, one-third of households experienced problems with hot water
pressure and delays in obtaining hot water after the tap is opened, and all households experienced
interruptions in hot water supply.
5.24          To cope with the insufficient room temperatures in winter, (a) about one-fourth of
households supplement DH with heat from individual space heaters, primarily electric heaters; (b)
about one-third of households replaced or plan to replace wall radiators, (c) two-thirds of households
close the curtains in their apartments, (d) a number of households weather-strip windows and doors, (e)
some households replace windows, and (f) only a few households supplement DH with gas heating,
since only very few households are connected to the gas network for space heating. While poorer
households have some ability to utilize the inexpensive procedure of weather-stripping, typically they
do not have the financial means of the better-off households to undertake the other measures, with the
poorest 25% of households on DH having practically no financial margin for coping with the
insufficient provision of DH and hot water. As a result, poor and vulnerable people are exposed to
hardships, increased health risks and other disadvantages due to deficient supplies of DH.
5.25         Social Assistance Program  for Low-Income Households.  Considering Ukraine's
policy of full cost recovery for DH and other communal services, particular emphasis in the social
assessment was placed on the effectiveness of the current social assistance system to provide targeted
assistance to low-income households for the provision of housing and communal services. Evidence
from the Kiev survey shows that this assistance system has serious flaws, with insufficient coverage,
not reaching about 54% of mainly poor people who have to pay more than 15% of their total monthly
expenditures on housing and communal services, and substantial leakage, with 24% of non-poor
households benefiting from social assistance when their expenditures on housing and communal
services are less than 15% of total monthly expenditures. The insufficient coverage and substantial
leakage of the social assistance program reveals that the means-testing carried out by the local
government to target social assistance to poor households is not working satisfactorily.
5.26         The social assistance program does not work effectively either for the providers of
communal services, such as Kievenergo, since the local government makes available only a small part
of the financial resources to be transferred to the service providers through the zheks for approved
social assistance. Based on information provided by the Ministry of Social Protection, the providers of
communal services in Kiev received only 35% of the funds to be transferred to them for approved
social assistance in 1996 which increased to about 50% in 1997. The local government's failure to
transfer the necessary financial resources puts the country's policy of full cost recovery for communal
services at risk.
5.27          Conclusions and Recommendations.  To protect poor and vulnerable households
against hardships in cold winters, a more reliable provision of DH and hot water at satisfactory levels
of service and quality is needed. The proposed project would make a substantial improvement in this
direction by supporting the investments necessary to address the current demand deficit and improve
service levels and reliability of DH and hot water for the city.
5.28         To improve coverage and reduce leakage of the social assistance program for low-
income households, the local government authority should redesign the methods applied for means-
testing. It is recommended that the current ineffective methodology be replaced by a suitable proxy
means test. This methodology, first implemented in Chile in the late 1970s and 1980s, then applied in



44
many other countries, has recently also been experimentally used in Volgograd, Russia, with technical
assistance of the World Bank. The methodology uses a formula of weighted variables of household
characteristics, which are easy to collect and verify, and allows to satisfactorily predict income. Such
household characteristics include, for example, number of children in the family, number of elderly,
location in rural or urban areas, number of unemployed household members, whether the household
owns a refrigerator or a car, etc. The formula used in proxy means testing has to be developed based
on suitable data on household expenditure and characteristics. The household surveys undertaken in
Ukraine during 1995 and 1996, supported by the survey in Kiev undertaken as part of the preparation
of this project, have generated a database suitable for developing a scoring formula for means testing in
Ukraine.
5.29         Further, the fact that 36% of the households unduly not receiving social assistance
believe that they are not eligible may suggest that these households are not appropriately informed
about the social assistance program, although they know about the existence of the program. To enable
households to better assess their eligibility for social assistance, the local government authority could
enhance its public information and communication strategy. In addition, the local government authority
could facilitate a suitable service for consultations with its residents about the program, which could be
used, at the same time, as a means of systematically obtaining feedback from households on issues of
program implementation. Establishing a telephone line in each city district for questions and answers
of citizens could be a suitable option.
5.30         In addition, the fact that 43% of the households unduly not receiving social assistance
observe unfriendly attitudes of the personnel processing social assistance applications may suggest that
these attitudes, to some extent, restrain households from applying for social assistance. To overcome
this obstacle, the local government could provide training and guidance to its personnel in charge of
processing social assistance applications.
5.31         To improve cost recovery of the DH  and hot water services from  residential
consumers, the service providers, such as Kievenergo, could address the local government's failure to
transfer funds for approved social assistance in the frame of reference of a suitable strategy of
beneficiary participation, whereby customers and the public in general are periodically informed about
the progress in obtaining funds for approved social assistance and the implications of the lack of these
funds for satisfactorily providing heating and hot water to households.  In addition, the service
providers could inform customers about the zheks' performance in passing on funds collected from
households. At the same time, the service providers could inform their customers and the public about
achievements and issues regarding the provision of heat and hot water and obtain feedback on the
quality and reliability of service provision.
5.32          Furthermore, efforts, such as those recently initiated by Kievenergo, to send bills
directly to consumers should be supported and expanded, as this provides a more transparent method of
billing. In this case, discounts provided for under the social assistance scheme could be applied by
Kievenergo which would then be in a position to clearly determine the level of social assistance
required from the local government authority. These recommendations to improve the social assistance
program and cost recovery will be pursued during the implementation phase of the project through
discussions with Kiev Municipality, through the Bank's ongoing dialogue on the Poverty Assessment
and through the Bank-supported Social Protection Support Project. In addition, a package of measures
to improve means testing and other aspects of the social assistance program is currently under
discussion with Kiev Municipality for consideration for inclusion in the complementary Kiev Public
Buildings Energy Efficiency Project.

KIEV DISTRICT HEATING IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Kiev Heat Demand Analysis
A. Kiev Heat Demand
1.           Kiev, with a population of about 2.7 million, requires heat to serve the demand
for hot water, space and ventilation heating of about 50 million m of residential buildings plus
approximately 25 million m of public and commercial buildings. Almost all households live
in apartment buildings, 92% of which have at least five floors, leading to a high concentration
of demand for heat per km2 of land, a factor favorable for DH. Industry demands heat for the
same purposes and for industrial processes.  There are more than a thousand industrial,
construction, transportation and storage facilities in the city.
2.            The heating season starts when temperature during five consecutive days has
fallen below 8°C and ends when temperature during five consecutive days has been above 80C.
During normal conditions, the heating season starts in October and ends in April. The capacity
of the heating systems in Kiev is designed to cover the heat demand of buildings during the
coldest days of the heating season when temperatures drop to -220C, a situation which normally
occurs more than 10 days during a heating season. The average outside temperature during the
heating seasons between 1990 and 1995 was 2. 1°C.
3.           As Figure 1.1 above shows, the average total annual heat demand in Kiev
during the first half of the 1990s was about 30 million Gcal, with households consuming 47%,
followed by commercial and public demand with 23%, and industries with the remaining 30%.
Average peak heat demand in the same period was about 11,000 Gcal/h, of which the
residential share was 46%, industrial 32% and commercial/public 22%. The target indoor
temperature is 180C (as compared to 200C in Finland), but due to severe fuel shortages since
1992 and capacity shortages, temperatures typically have reached no more than 150C during the
period and have been as low as 10-130C in some areas.
Annual Heat Demand                       Peak Heat Demand
30 million Gcal                     11 thousand Gcal per hour
Figure 1.1: Kiev Heat Energy and Peak Heat Demand



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 8
4.           Kiev is divided into eight DH  regions, two of which are for future
development. About 80% of the public-residential demand and 40% of industrial demand are
currently covered by the interconnected system operated by Kievenergo (production,
transmission and supply) and by KMDHC (distribution). The system cuts across the areas of
the six heating regions with the highest demand densities. It is divided into a number of "mini-
sections," each closed off by valves and served by a particular CHP or HOB plant.
5.           About 6% of the public-residential demand for heat is covered by 112 isolated
DH systems operated by KMDHC, including individual boilers in the buildings. These isolated
systems are far from of the interconnected system (about 10 kmn away) to make an
interconnection economically feasible. The remaining 14% of public-residential heat demand is
covered by 29 isolated DH systems connected to industrial boilers, to small "apartment sized"
boilers installed in individual houses, and to Akademiteploenergo, the DH company of the
Academy of Science, which supplies heat from its two HOB plants to several academic
institutes and industrial customers. The remaining 60% of industrial demand is covered by
industrial boilers.
6.           The economic crisis and the deep structural changes experienced by Ukraine
since independence from the former Soviet Union (FSU) have had a severe impact on heat
demand and supply. On the demand side, residential demand for peak capacity in Kiev
continued to rise by 6-7% between 1990 and 1995 with the increase in residential construction,
whereas public demand fell by an estimated 5-7% per year during the same period. The share
of industrial demand in the interconnected system fell by 16% in 1991 to 5% in 1996 because
of production cutbacks, closure of industrial concerns and the increase in heat tariffs. On the
supply side, Kievenergo was forced by its weak financial position to postpone needed
investments to expand capacity in the interconnected system where a capacity deficit emerged
despite the slower growth in public and industrial demand. The available capacity in the
interconnected system in 1996 was 6,300 Gcal/h serving a demand of about 7,200 Gcal/h,
estimated by considering the current building volume and target indoor temperature. The
demand deficit is distributed unevenly in the interconnected system, with the more severe
deficit in the city center and in the growth areas such as Pozniaki.
B. Heat Demand Forecasts
7.           The forecasts in the 1995 Master Plan ("Draft Plan of the Kiev DH System
Development in the Period until 2005 and Potentially Until 2010" prepared by Ukrenergoprom
in close cooperation with Kievenergo, Energoproject and Kievproyekt) provided the basis for
Kievenergo's investment program in heat production capacity in the interconnected DH system.
The forecasts of residential and public heat demand were based on expected population growth,
planned development of the city, on estimates of improved housing area per inhabitant and on
the expected decommissioning of houses. The corresponding figures for peak load and annual
heating energy for residential and public buildings are calculated on the basis of Ukrainian
building design standards. The forecast of industrial heat demand was based on a detailed
analysis of known industrial enterprises that have survived the recent economic downturn and
that are likely to exist in the future, considering their new construction and expansion plans and
expected changes in production technology.



ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 8
8.           According to the Master Plan, total peak heat demand in Kiev (excluding self-
produced industrial heat) is forecasted to increase from 10,700 Gcal/h in 1996 to 13,300 Gcal/h
in 2011. Within this, the peak demand in the interconnected system is expected to increase
from 7,200 Gcal/h to 10,260 Gcal1h. In the short term, the largest expansion in demand comes
from heat district 6 (which provides the justification for the construction of the Pozniaki plant),
and from district 1 (where the ongoing residential construction will conclude about 2001).
TETS 5 supplies districts 1, 5 and 6. Once the Pozniaki plant becomes operational, TETS 5
will supply districts 1 and 5 only. TETS 6 supplies districts 3 and 4. Around 40% of the
growth in construction during the period will occur in the virgin districts 7 and 8, which are
outside the focus of the project. The heat demand in these two regions will be covered by new
boilers within those isolated DH systems.
9.           The Master Plan estimates have been adjusted downwards considering: (a) the
decline in industrial demand (excluding the demand for steam) that occurred in 1996, (b) the
limited availability of capital in Ukraine to fund new residential buildings, (c) the energy
conservation response to economic pricing of heat, and (d) efficiency improvements in the
operation of the DH system. The forecast of peak heat demand in the interconnected system,
taking into account the adjustments in (a), (b) and (c) above, is shown in Table 1.1 following.

10.          As mentioned before, the forecasts above have been adjusted to take into
account expected investments in energy saving measures. The forecasts assume that energy
efficiency of buildings constructed between 2001 and 2005 will be 3% higher than the 1986
norms and of buildings built between 2006 and 2010, 5% higher.
11.          Table  1.2 below  shows separately the impacts of energy  efficiency
improvements on energy and peak demand for heat in buildings built before 1997.
Improvements in temperature control, insulation and other measures reduce the annual
consumption of heat energy. These improvements, however, have only a limited impact on
peak demand.

and Residential Heat Energy and Peak Heat Demand

12.          Further adjustments to the heat demand forecasts have been made considering
the expected efficiency improvements in the operation of the DH system. It has been assumed
that the improvements of the thermal insulation of pipes and reduction in water leakages will
gradually decrease the average level of transmission and distribution losses from the present
20% to 12% by 2011, equivalent to the average level of losses in German DH systems in 1994,
reducing the need for new heat production capacity.
13.          Furthermore, the Master Plan assumes a 100% correlation of the coincidence
of different consumers' peak heat demand under the current constant flow system. The
introduction of variable flow through individual controls at consumers will decrease the
coincidence factor. The forecast assumes that the present coincidence factor will decline to
95% by 2011, after converting a major part of the DH system to variable flow. Table 1.3
summarizes the assumptions concerning efficiency changes in the operation of the DH system
used in the forecasts of heat production capacity.

developed as presented in Table 1.4 below. In the final calculation of the heat production
capacity requirements, the impacts of the coincidence at peak, system losses and a 15 % reserve
capacity requirement have been considered.

2, TETS 5, TETS 6 and Pozniaki. (The real available capacity in 1996 was about 250 Gcal/h
less than shown in the table, because of operational problems in the Voskresenka and Beliche
boiler plants.)

16.          The project will increase the heat production capacity of the interconnected
system operated by Kievenergo by 2003 to about 8,156 Gcal/h, representing a net increase in
production capacity of 1,570 Gcal/h.  At the same time, the heat production capacity
requirements are estimated to increase by 2001 to about 9,295 Gcal/h, as compared to current
available production capacity of about 6,300 Gcal/h, representing a need for about 2,995
Gcal/h of additional capacity. For the interconnected DH system operated by Kievenergo, the
project is expected to be able to meet today's shortfall of about 1,520 Gcal/h in production
capacity (excluding reserve requirements) and about 50 Gcal/h of the additional 1,475 Gcal/h
needed to meet the conservative estimates of future growth in 2001.

UKRAINE
KIEV DISTRICT HEATING IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Economic Analysis
1.            Least-cost, economic, financial, sensitivity, risk and distributional analyses were
conducted on the 9 economically independent components. The economic and financial internal rates of
return are based on the incremental costs and benefits derived from the "with and without" project
approach. All costs and benefits flows are expressed in 1998 constant economic prices. The 10%
discount rate used in the analysis corresponds to the opportunity cost of capital in Ukraine. The key
assumptions and results of these analyses, with a component-by-component breakdown of the main
features, are presented below.
A. Least Cost Analysis
2.            Three subprojects were identified that could be supplied alternatively with independent
gas boilers in individual buildings, including Pozniaki boiler plant and TETS 5 and TETS 6 rehabilitation
and expansion components. All of these subprojects are less expensive than the alternative of independent
gas boilers installed in individual buildings.
3.            The basic idea in the comparison of alternatives is that the costs of the base option of
rehabilitating and/or expanding district heating (DH) would be evaluated against the costs of the option of
decentralizing the heating system to buildings which would be furnished with two individual gas boilers.
For reliability of supply, two boilers (2 x 70%) would be installed in each building. It was first
considered that the boilers could be located on the roofs of buildings, whereby neither separate boiler
houses nor chimneys would be required. However, since most buildings were constructed in the 1950's
("Kruchevka buildings") and are in an advanced state of disrepair, in practice it might not be technically
or economically feasible to reinforce the building structures for roof-top boilers. Also it would be difficult
to obtain the necessary permits, given current building standards. Therefore, given that the concerned
areas are not too congested, ground level gas boilers were considered. In addition to the heating system
investments, an allowance has been made for inproving and increasing the capacity of the existing gas
distribution network, which is basically designed for the supply of cooking gas only.  The basic
parameters of the alternative of independent gas boilers are presented in Table 1.

4.            The total investment required to decentralize the heat supply and to implement individual
gas heating for each building is estimated to be between US$ 60,000-70,000. The required capital and



ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 15
operating costs for this alternative for the considered subprojects were, in each case, considerably higher
than rehabilitation of the existing systems and expansion; consequently, the proposed DH subprojects were
recommended for further economic analysis.
5.            It should also be noted that several of the areas are linked together with other networks
and the boiler plants complement each other during summer maintenance periods and in case of boiler
unavailability during the heating season. The conversion to decentralized gas heating would have an
adverse effect on the adjacent systems.
6.            Individual gas heating is a competitive option in smaller areas with lower heat load
densities. This is the case especially in new areas where both options are "green field" investments but
also in cases where rehabilitation of the DH system requires (almost) complete rebuilding.
B. Cost Benefit Analysis
7.            The economic rates of return (ERRs) are evaluated from the comparison of the economic
costs with the economic benefits. The costs and benefits are incremental and derived from the comparison
of "with project" versus "without project" situation.  The without project scenario represents the
continued operation of the system "as is", subject only to routine maintenance, and with the continued
degradation of the existing DH assets, the deterioration of efficiency, losses and reliability. The ERR is
the discount rate that produces a zero net present value for the difference between costs and benefits.
8.            The investment costs are net of fiscal and financial transfers and represent the annual
costs (foreign and domestic) for the execution of each component. The technical assistance is considered
necessary for the overall success of each subproject and thus allocated proportionally to their investment
costs. An allowance of 10% for physical contingencies has been made. The economic life of the
components has been estimated at 20 years. The projects cost estimates are based on early 1998 price
levels.
9.            Running costs include fuel, operation, repair and maintenance expenditures, as well as
losses. Fuel costs are applicable only to the boiler plant investments. Fuel costs were estimated based
on the international prices of natural gas and heavy fuel oil as forecast by the World Bank for Europe
adjusted for Ukrainian transport costs to the boiler house. Table 2 presents the adopted annual gas
price forecasts.

C. Consumer Surplus
11.          An important benefit in some investment components is the willingness to pay (WTP)
for the additional supply. As mentioned earlier, WTP is the area under the demand curve. It consists
of sales revenue and consumer surplus. When a project prevents a demand deficit, it actually prevents
the price to rise under competition to that level of demand that would reach an equilibrium with the
constrained supply. When a project prevents a price hike, more consumers have access to the same
product and existing consumers pay a lower price for the same amount of consumption. Valuing the
benefits of additional supply at the ongoing price understates the project's contribution to society's
welfare, because it ignores consumer surplus: the difference between what consumers are prepared to
pay for a product and what they actually pay. In principle, this increase in consumer surplus should be
treated as part of the benefits of the project.
12.          Measuring consumer surplus is straightforward under certain simplifying assumptions.
Consider a project that lowers the price of a product from P1 to P2. As a result of the lower price, the
quantity demanded rises from Ql to Q2 as Figure 1 shows. Consumer surplus is the sum of areas A
and B. Area A is what consumers save from the price drop and is equal to the difference in price times
the quantity sold at the old price.
13.          There may also be a gain              Figure 1: Consumer Surplus
in consumer surplus without any decline
in price. If supply is rationed at a price
below what consumers would be willing to
pay, an increase in supply at the same
controlled  price  involves  a  gain  in  P1
consumer surplus over and above what
consumers actually pay for the increase.   P2
This is particularly significant for public
utility projects.
14.          In this project, a linear
demand curve and a price elasticity of     -                -
demand of -0.5 have been assumed. With                      Q      Q
these   assumptions   and   with  the
information on consumption with the project (Q2), the existing price (P2) and the avoided deficit (Q2 -
Ql), the price without the project (P1) has been estimated. With the help of a spreadsheet model, the
incremental sales revenue and consumer surplus associated with the avoided deficit due to each boiler
plant component and the Center electric substation were estimated for each year.
D. Economic Value Of Unserved Heat
15.          In the present situation in Kiev, the consumers' demand for heat cannot be fully
satisfied for several reasons, including (a) unavailability of transmission or distribution equipment due
to unscheduled outages, (b) rationing due to scarcity of fuel (budget constraint), and (c) capacity
deficit.
16.          Outages in distribution are typically caused by pipe breakdowns. Depending on the
network layout, substituting heat delivery can sometimes be arranged to some extent by changing the
sectioning of the network and by alternative water flow routing. Usually, however, the heat delivery is
cut-off completely from consumers who depend on the damaged transmission or distribution segment.
The actual damage caused by a total cut in heat delivery can become substantial, depending on the
duration of the outage.



ANNEX 10
Page 5 of 15
17.          As an example, in December 1996 a breakage occurred in a DN 500 pipeline in
Kievenergo's system. The ambient temperature was about -20°C and the repair and resumption of
supply took about 10 days. Meanwhile, the consumers either suffered from cold or used alternative
heating methods, typically electric heaters. In some houses, where the heating and domestic hot water
risers were not drained, the freezing caused the pipes to burst causing significant damage.
18.          Heat supply is currently being rationed for several months during the heating period.
Room temperatures remain below the design values, but continuous heat delivery is secured.
Fortunately, the present constant flow heat distribution method is well suited to allocate the scarcity
relatively evenly among consumers. From the consumer's point of view, low room temperature causes
inconveniences, health risks and moisture problems in buildings.
19.          During peak demand periods, the existing heat production capacity is insufficient to
meet demand (even if sufficient fuel were available). This causes further rationing in heat supply.
Currently, the room temperature can remain as low as 10-14°C in some districts during cold winter
periods.
20.          The value of unserved heat can be estimated based on: (a) the substitution costs of
alternative heating methods, and (b) the economic value of damages caused by undelivered heat. The
first method provides a very conservative estimate because not every household can afford to purchase
an electric heater. Consumers that can not afford an electric heater bear all the costs associated with the
increased sickness rate, work absences and loss of income due to a prolonged heat supply outage. The
second method would provide a better estimate, since there are other economic damages caused by
underheating and cut-off periods, not only to households, but also to industrial users, such as the direct
and indirect production losses where heat is one of the main inputs, mechanical damages in buildings'
heating systems, and in building structures (insulation, painting, etc.) due to moisture. Consequently,
the cost of unserved heat varies considerably depending on the time of year, consumer type, duration of
interruption, etc.
21.          In  the  analysis  for  this  Table 4: Estimation of Value of Unserved Heat

value has been derived from the first method  Concept                   Value      Unit

E. Risk Analysis
22.           The project components are subject to several risks which are largely beyond the scope
of the project design, such as macroeconomic, policy and institutional risks, as well as those related to
the existing system. The purpose of risk analysis is to assign probability distributions to the different
input variables, key parameters and assumptions so that a weighted expected outcome can be obtained.
Risk analysis allows the examination of the risks which are more relevant for the profitability of the
project, enabling the design of a more targeted risk mitigation strategy. The software "Crystal Ball"
was used to carry out the analysis. The software allowed the extension of the forecasting capability of
the spreadsheet cost benefit model developed in Excel for each project component. Each input
variable, parameter and assumption was expressed as a range of possible values within a probability
distribution curve. Then, by using a Monte Carlo simulation, the software enabled the outcomes of the
cost benefit model in a forecast chart showing the entire range of possible results and the likelihood of
achieving each of them.
23.           The main input variables, key parameters and assumptions of the analysis along with
their risk distribution curves, are presented in Table 5 below.

analysis is presented below. The frequency chart shows the ERRs on the X axis and the probabilities
of occurrence on the Y axis. After 1,000 trials, the range of the ERRs extended from 5.2% (the most
uneconomic return) to 28.8 % (the best possible outcome). It was estimated, with a 75% certainty, that
a minimum ERR of 13.2% could be expected for Pozniaki, well above the 10% discount rate.

KIEV DISTRICT HEATING IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Social Assessment
I. INTRODUCTION
1.           During the appraisal of the project, a social assessment was carried out to
appraise the impacts of the lack of adequate heat on residential district heat customers in Kiev.
The assessment was based on: (i) structured in-depth interviews and focus group discussions
with residential district heat customers and (ii) a survey administered to 365 households in
Kiev. The Kiev International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) carried out the survey and provided
consultants for assisting in conducting in-depth interviews and focus group discussion. The
findings of the assessment are presented below.
II. FINDINGS
A. GENERAL INDICATORS
2.           POPULATION AND TYPE OF RESIDENCE. The vast majority of Kiev's households
live in flats in apartment buildings and have district heating. Thus the population on district
heating in Kiev is practically identical with the city's population, in general. Only 33% of the
households are connected to district heating networks countrywide.
3.           DISTRICT HEAT AND HOT WATER SUPPLY. In Kiev, 96% of residential district
heat customers receive hot water supply in conjunction with the provision of district heat.
Nationwide, only 70% of the households with district heating have hot water in conjunction
with district heating.
4.           DISTRICT HEATING AND GAS FOR SPACE HEATING. Some of Kiev's households
on district heat (6%) have gas connections for space heating in addition to district heating.
5.           ELECTRICITY, COLD WATER, CENTRAL SEWERAGE, TELEPHONE. In Kiev, all
househoids on district heat have electricity, cold water supply and central sewerage. 77% of
these households have telephones. Nationwide, only 61 % of households are connected to the
cold water network, 36% have central sewerage and 37% have telephones.
6.           HOUSEHOLD SIZE, CHILDREN, LIVING SPACE. In Kiev, households on district
heat have, on average, 3.05 members, 1.24 children under 15 years of age and 36 m2 of living
space. These indicators are similar to those of Ukraine's population as a whole.
7.           OWNERSHIP. In Kiev, 38% of the households on district heat own their flats,
55 % of the flats belong to the state and 5 % to a state agency. By contrast, nationwide, 72% of
households own their homes, while 24% of the dwellings belong to the state or a state agency.
Of those households in Kiev who own their flats, 26% received it under arrangements with a
housing construction cooperative, 56% privatized it and 10% bought it. Of those households



ANNEX 1 
Page 2 of 7
whose flats belong to the state, 36% plan to privatize their flats. On average, households have
been living for about 13 years in their current flats. 69% of the families interviewed were on a
waiting list before getting their flats. The families were on the waiting lists for about 10 years,
on average.
B. DISTRICT HEATING
8.           COLD  ROOM  TEMPERATURE.   In  general, households considered  the
temperature in their flats during winter too cold. In 20% of the flats, the temperature was too
low, always; in 18% of the flats, frequently; and in 39% of the flats, sometimes. Only in 23%
of the flats was it never too cold. Apartments located in building corners tend to be colder than
apartments not situated in corners.
9.           HEATING INTERRUPTIONS. Heating interruptions, once or several times, were
reported by 34% of the households. Most of the interruptions lasted from a few hours to a
whole day. In some cases, the interruptions lasted from two days to one week, in other cases
they lasted more than a week.
10.          DIFFERENCES IN EFFECTIVENESS OF HEATING. 35 % of the households indicate
that heating is better in the upper floors of the buildings. 38% of the households indicate that
heating is better in some of the rooms in their flat than in others.
11.          SUPPLEMENTING DISTRICT HEATING. To improve the room temperature in
winter, about 26% of the households supplement district heat by using individual space heaters.
In almost all of the cases, households use electric heating equipment. The few households with
connections to the gas network for space heating (see No. 3 above) are able to supplement
district heating with gas heating when the provision of district heating is unsatisfactory.
12.          INSULATION. To make their flats less drafty, a number of households insulate
or weather-strip windows (44%) and doors (26%) in their apartments. Poor' and non-poor2
households report this inexpensive procedure of home insulation at similar rates of frequency.
Some households also replace windows to make their apartments tighter; however, primarily
better-off households can afford this measure.
13.          REPLACING RADIATORS. To improve the temperature in their apartments, 22%
of the households replaced one or more of their wall radiators. An additional 9% still plan to
replace radiators. However, primarily better-off and hardly the poor households can afford this
investment.
14.          OPENING WINDOWS. In 20% of the cases, it was sometimes too hot in the
apartments of the respondents. However, high room temperature was practically never the
motive for opening windows in winter. The overwhelming majority of households opens
windows in the apartments to get fresh air. Most of the respondents open windows several
times per day. On average, they open the windows more than five minutes each time.
' Poor households are defined as the 25% of households with the lowest per capita expenditures. Currently,
there is no suitable poverty line available.
2Non-poor households are all households not included in the group of the 25% of households with the
lowest per capita expenditures.



ANNEX I I
Page 3 of 7
15.          METERING AND CONSERVING HEAT.  42% of households think it would be
better to have a heat meter in each apartment and pay for the heat actually received. However,
only 22 % of the households would consume less heat than they are currently consuming, if they
paid only for the heat actually received. Two thirds of households would not consider it an
improvement if heat meters were installed only at the building level. Furthermore, in about
44% of the cases, households regularly close the curtains in winter to keep their apartment
warmer. An additional 19% of the household close curtains when it is very cold. If curtains
cover the wall radiators, almost 42% of the households lift the curtains when they are closed to
get as much heat as possible.
C. HOT WATER
16.          QUALITY OF SERVICE. Only in 35% of the apartments hot water comes out
immediately when the tap is opened. In 27% of the cases, it comes out after a minute, in 21 %
of the cases, after one to five minutes, and in 16% of the cases, it takes more than five minutes.
Hot water interruptions are reported by almost all households. 59% of the households indicate
that such interruptions occur several times in recent months, 25% indicate, regularly, and 8%
say, at least, once. 46% of the households indicate that interruptions are more likely to occur
in summer, whereas 53% report interruptions to occur at any time of the year. 34% of the
households have problems with hot water pressure. Due to low pressure, many households
sometimes have little or no hot water; some households, often; and a few households, always.
17.          METERING AND CONSERVING HOT WATER. 39% of the households would like
to have a hot water meter in their apartment. However, the vast majority of the households are
not willing to pay for the installation of a meter. If they had to make an effort, 40% of the
households would be able to save a little of the hot water they consume while 47% indicated
they would not be able to conserve anything. If paying only for the hot water really consumed,
35 % of the households indicated that they would consume less than they are actually
consuming.
D. EXPENDITURE
18.          Households on district heat spend most of their total expenditures for food, on
average, 63%. For district heating, they spend 6% and for hot water, 4%. For housing and
communal services altogether, including the charges for electricity, water, sewerage, gas,
telephone (except long distance calls) as well as some other minor services, households spend,
on average, 19% of their total expenditures. Together, the charges for district heating and hot
water amount to one half of all the charges housing and communal services.
E. POVERTY AND EXPENDITURE
19.          DIFFERENT  STRUCTURE  OF  EXPENDITURE  OF  POOR  AND  NON-POOR
HOUSEHOLDS. The structure of expenditure of poor and better-off households is different.
Poor households spend considerably more of their total expenditure for food than non-poor
households. Also, poor households spend much more of their total expenditure than non-poor
households for district heating, hot water, as well as housing and all other communal services.



ANNEX 11

20.          COMPARISON ACROSS EXPENDITURE GROUPS. Household expenditure shares
for housing and communal services as well as food can be compared across expenditure groups
obtained by ranking households according to per capita expenditure and dividing them in 4
equally sized segments, or quartiles, as shown in Table 1 below. This comparison shows that
the shares of expenditure for district heating, hot water, gas, water and sewerage, housing,
electricity and food decrease as the household per capita income increases. In addition, the
comparison shows that the households of the bottom quartile spend between 2 and 6 times the
share of their total expenditures for different municipal services as the households of the top
quartile spend for the same purpose.

/1 Expenditure quartiles have been established based on ranking household per capita expenditure in
ascending order.
/2 Discounts and subsidies are deducted.
21.          LIMITED MARGIN OF POOR HOUSEHOLDS FOR COPING WITH INSUFFICIENT
PROVISION OF DISTRICT HEATING AND HOT WATER. In-depth interviews and focus group
discussions with local consultants and households in Kiev showed that the poor have practically
no margin for coping with insufficient provision of district heating and hot water. Data on
household expenditure obtained from the survey carried out during the appraisal mission helps
to explain this finding, as shown in Table 2 below.  In this table, shares of non-food
expenditures and expenditure shares for housing and communal services altogether can be
compared across expenditure groups. The subtraction of the expenditure shares for housing
and communal services from shares of non-food expenditures in line 3 of the table produces a
negative value for quartile 1. Considering that total household expenditure is composed of food
and non-food expenditure, this value means that the poorest 25 % of the households on district
heat would have to reduce their expenditure for food if they fully and timely paid all the
charges for housing and communal services.

22.          PAYMENT OF RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS FOR HOUSING AND COMMUNAL
SERVICES. In Kiev, 44% of the households owe for housing and communal services, and on
average, they owe 4.45 monthly payments. When they pay, they pay for 1.37 months, on
average. More poor households than non-poor households owe for housing and communal
services, and, in addition, they owe larger amounts. Only very few households with debts for
housing and communal services have entered into a formal arrangement with their zheks for
paying these debts in installments over a mutually agreed period of time. The vast majority of
households would not pay on time for housing and comnmunal services, even if they were fined
or cut off from service. Similarly, almost all households are not willing to pay 20% more for
district heating and hot water if the service would improve. (A 20% tariff increase for heat and
hot water is expected to be implemented in Kiev around mid-1997 to allow for full cost
recovery from residential consumers.) The vast majority (90%) of the respondents with debts
for housing and communal services indicate they don't pay on time because they don't have
enough money.
F. DISCOUNTS
23.          In Kiev, nearly 32%  of the households receive discounts for housing and
communal services, including electricity. In almost 90% of the cases, the discounts amount to
50% of the regular tariff. 13% of the households get 25% discounts, while some households
get 75% or 100% discounts. In 75% of the cases, these discounts apply for all household
members, otherwise, only for single members of the household.
G. SUBSIDIES FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
24.          The subsidy program is practically known to all households in Kiev, and all
households surveyed know where and how to apply. About 28 % of the households receive the
subsidy, whereas 3 % of the applications have been rejected. 29% of the households surveyed
believe that they are not eligible; some indicate that their debts for housing and communal
services prevented them from applying (3 %); others did not apply because they did not want to
get registered as unemployed (6%); 13% of the households still plan to apply; and 12% do not
plan to apply for different reasons. On average, the subsidy per beneficiary household amounts
to 34 Hryvnias.
25.          BENEFICIARY SATISFACTION. Largely, households did not complain about the
administrative procedures for applying to the subsidy, and the performance of the officials
processing the applications. The majority of the respondents qualified the attitude of the civil
servants processing the applications as "normal."  10%  of the respondents thought the
personnel processing applications were polite and considerate whereas 26% rated their attitude
rather negatively. Minor complaints were that lines in the subsidy offices were long and that
the applicants had to come several times.
26.          LEAKAGE AND LACK OF COVERAGE. The effectiveness of the program is
constrained by serious flaws.  First, the system has a substantial leakage:  24%  of the
households receiving the subsidy do not deserve it because their expenditure for housing and
communal services, including electricity, would not exceed 15% of their total expenditure per
month if they would not receive the subsidy. Second, the subsidy program has insufficient
coverage: 54% of the households not receiving the subsidy, would deserve it, because they



ANNEX I I
Page 6 of 7
have to pay more than 15% of their total expenditure for housing and communal services.
Most of these households are poor. 36% of the households unduly not receiving the subsidy,
think they are not eligible. 43% of the same segment of households observe unfriendly
attitudes of the personnel processing subsidy applications.
27.           DEFICIENT MEANS-TESTING.  The insufficient coverage and the substantial
leakage of the subsidy program reveal that the means-testing carried out by the local
government to target the subsidy to poor households is not working satisfactorily.
28.           LACK OF FINANCIAL TRANSFERS TO MUNICIPAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. In spite
of the above constraints to its effectiveness, the subsidy program works for the residential
population in so far as beneficiary households in fact pay less for housing and communal
services. However, the program hardly works for the providers of communal services, like
Kievenergo, because the city makes available only a small part of the financial resources to be
transferred to the latter for approved subsidies. Furthermore, Kievenergo does not know what
share of the funds to be transferred by the zheks are charges paid by households for heat and
hot water, and what proportion of the funds to be transferred are financial resources for
approved subsidies because, currently, subsidies are approved globally for housing and
communal services including electricity and are not prorated to the different services provided
and deducted from the respective charges at the level of each residential customer. In Kiev, the
providers of communal services received in 1996 only 35% of the funds to be transferred to
them for approved subsidies. The city's failure of transferring financial resources to local
utilities for approved subsidies puts at risk the Government's policy of fully recovering costs
for the provision of communal services.
III. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
29.           To protect poor and vulnerable households against hardships in cold winters, a
reliable provision of district heating and hot water at satisfactory levels of quality is needed.
Poor households suffer more than better-off households from insufficient heating levels because
their financial margin for coping with this deficiency is limited.
30.          The fact that 36% of the households unduly not receiving the subsidy believe
that they are not eligible (see No 26 above) may suggest that these households are not
appropriately informed about the subsidy program although they very well know that the
program exists (see No 24 above). To enable households to better assess their eligibility for the
subsidy, the local government in Kiev should enhance its public information and
communication strategy regarding the subsidy program. In addition, the city should facilitate
for its residents a suitable service for consultations on the program. This service could be
used, at the same time, as a means of systematically obtaining feedback from households on
issues of program implementation. Establishing a telephone line in each city district for
questions and answers of citizens regarding the subsidy could be a suitable option to better
inform the public and get feedback from residents.
31.           The fact that 43% of the households unduly not receiving the subsidy observe
unfriendly attitudes of the personnel processing subsidy applications (see No 26 above) may
suggest that these attitudes, to some extent, restrain households from applying for the subsidy.

To overcome this obstacle, the local government in Kiev should provide training and guidance
in dealing with customers to its personnel in charge of processing subsidy applications.
32.           To improve coverage and reduce leakage of the subsidy program for low-
income households, the local government in Kiev should redesign the methods applied for
means-testing. The current ineffective methodology used should be replaced by a suitable
proxy means test. This methodolgy, first implemented in Chile in the late 1970s and 1980s,
then applied in many other countries, and recently also experimentally used in Volgograd,
Russia, with technical assistance of the World Bank, uses a formula of weighted variables
consisting of information on household characteristics which is easy to collect and verify and
allows to satisfactorily predict income. Such characteristics are frequently variables such as
number of children in the family, number of elderly, location in rural or urban areas, number
of unemployed household members, whether the household owns a refrigerator or a car etc.
The formula used in proxy means testing has to be developed based on suitable data on
household expenditure and characteristics. The household surveys carried out in Ukraine in
1995 and 1996 (and further refined for surveying Kiev households) have generated a database
suitable for developing a scoring formula for means testing in Ukraine.
33.          The transfer of funds for approved subsidies from the city should be addressed
by Kievenergo in the frame of reference of a suitable strategy for beneficiary participation.
The objective of this strategy would be to: (i) regularly inform customers and the public in
general on achievements and issues regarding the provision of heat and hot water and (ii) obtain
feed-back from customers on quality and reliability of service provision. In the context of this
strategy, residential customers and the public should be periodically informed regarding
Kievenergo's efforts of obtaining funds due for approved subsidies.  In particular, the
information provided to beneficiaries and the public should include details on the implications
of the lack of these funds for satisfactorily providing heating and hot water to households. Also
in the context of this strategy, residential customers and the public should be informed
regarding the zheks' regular failure of passing on to Kievenergo all funds collected from
households for communal services.  Simultaneously, Kievenergo should inform  on the
implications of the lack of these funds for satisfactorily providing heating and hot water to
residential customers.
