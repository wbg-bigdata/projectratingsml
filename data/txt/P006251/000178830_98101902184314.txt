INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION CF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO CENTRAIS ELETRICAS DE MINAS GERAIS, S.A.
FOR THE SAO SIMAO HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais, S.A. (CEMIG), with the guarantee of the
Federative Republic of Brazil, for the equivalent of $60 million to finance
part of the civil works and engineering services for construction of the Sao
Simao hydroelectric plant. The loan would have a final maturity of 30 years,
including a seven-year grace period, and interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Brazil" (WH-210a), dated November 30, 1971, was distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors on December 2, 1971. A country data sheet is attached as
Annex II. The Report describes Brazil's remarkable economic growth over
the past few years and the policies which the Government has followed in
achieving this performance. The Report also calls attention to the large
external capital inflow which was associated with rapid growth. During
1968-70 the net inflow amounted to $2.5 billion of which $1.7 billion con-
sisted of financial credits with maturities of one to four years.  The role
of medium and long-term finance was important -- development agencies con-
tributed $690 million net (IDB -- $312 million; AID -- $278 million; and
IBRD -- $98 million), while suipplierst credits, including U.S. Export-Import
3ank, totalled about $200 million.  Direct investments amounted to $270 million.
3.        The Report points out that continuation of rapid growth in the 1970s
requires substantial increases in external capital inflows. There is a good
prospect that this capital will be forthcoming on better terms than in the
recent past. The Government has placed controls on short-term financial
borrowing and has made considerable progress in formulating investment projects
suitable for external financing. These steps will result in an expanded flow
of supplier credits and project loans. However, the gross external capital
requirement cannot be met if external assistance is tied entirely to the
foreign exchange component of project costs. Although the capital investment
needed to support Brazil's economic growth targets is substantial, the import
needs of most investment projects are relatively low, as Brazil's capital
goods industry is already highly developed and has proven its ability to
compete successfully under international competitive bidding.



-2-
4.        Brazilts total external disbursed debt amounted to $6.6 billion
at the end of 1971,|of which more than two-fifths consisted of financial
credits. Because financial credits include a large component of disguised
direct investment and commercial bank working capital credit lines, they
are probably not highly volatile despite the fac.t that an appreciable
proportion.bears terms of one. year or less.  Moreover, much of the. in-
crease'in' financial'credits-has been matched by an increase in foreign.
reserves-,. which were equivalent to some $2.0 billion at.the end of 1971,
representing 6 mont4s' goods and nonfactor services imports. Brazilts
debt service ratio on long-term debt, excluding non-guaranteed private
debt', amounted to 12.3 percent in 1971. Although external.debt management
is one of'the more critical issues confronting the Government at high rates
of growth', Brazil should be able to service the increasing debt needed to
support its growth targets if'the present high quality of economic manage-
ment is sustained.
PART II --THE BANK'S ROLE IN BRAZIL
5.        Since 1949,' Brazil. has received 40 loans from the Bank amounting
to $1,308.1. million (net' of' cancellations).  A suimnary statement- of loans
and.credits, as of March 31, 1972, is attached as Annex I.  Of'the loans
declared effective, 22 have not been fully disbursed, and of those, dis-
bursement of 12 was behind schedule at the end of 1971. Nine of'the.latter
are for electric power projects.. This is due to a number of factors.which
were;discussed in detail a&t.the time of the presentation to the Executive
Directors of the Salto Osorio Hydroelectric Project (728 BR') in March 1971.
As then stated, technical problems relating to 404o BR, 442 BR,, 565 BR and
566 BR have been solved and' project work is now progressing satisfactorily.,
Implementation of four power. distribution projects (474-478 BR) was initially
slowed by organization and(administrative difficulties which have been sub-
stantially removed. After initial delays, progress in the execution of the'
First Highway Project (567'BR) is now progressing satisfactorily.   Dis-
bursement of the loan to the'Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB) (656 BR) has.
been slower than originally expected.  The major contributing factor was,.
until recently, easy availability to industrial companies in the Northeast
area of'Brazil of subsidized.government funds. As the availability of such
funds is being progressively restricted, demand through BNB for the Bank
loan is likely to increase'.
6.-       The-overall pace of disbursements shows considerable improvement.
During FY65 to FY69 disbursements averaged $10 million per year. They rose
to' $66' million. in FY.70,. to $75 million in FY71,. and were $98 million in the
first- three quarters of FY.72. We expect that the disbursement. rate, will
continue- to accelerate during the next few years.



7.        Brazil is the country with the largest share of IFC's commitmen-s.
Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in Brazil totalling $62.3 million,
of which $5.1 million has been repaid, $13.4 million sold and $1.3 million
cancelled. Of the balance of $42.5 million, $30.8 million represents loans
and $11.7 million equity. A summary of IFC investments is given in Annex I.
8.        Bank lending to Brazil has been very active in this fiscal year.
Five loans totalling $312.5 million have already been approved for the MBR
iron ore and related railway projects, the CSN and USIMINAS steel projects
and the third highway project. We are actively processing loans for COSIPA's
steel program and for a land settlement project in the Northeast of Brazil.
The project for the development of the capital market (FUMCAP) for which a
Bank loan was originally contemplated is now being examined by IFC which is
responsible for capital market operations within the Bank Group.
9.        In lending to Brazil, the Bank is responding to Brazil's demonstra-
ted ability to absorb increasing amounts of external capital that enable it to
sustain a high rate of economic growth. In selecting sectors and projects for
lending, the Bank seeks to fill important development needs. In the first
place, the Bank can help Brazil to increase its foreign capital inflow by
associating Bank loans either with sectors where sufficient bilateral fi-
nancing is not available or where the Bank's participation will help Brazil
obtain such financing. The Bank's recent and projected lending for electric
energy projects, including the proposed loans for the Sao Simao project, meets
this criterion. We also hope that bilateral lenders will progressively in-
crease their financing of development projects, and will be willing to finance
some local currency expenditures, particularly in the field of highway con-
struction. We, therefore, encouraged the Brazilians to seek bilateral finance
for a part of the highway program which the Bank assisted with its $89 million
loan of April 11, 1972. In the second place, we hope to direct Bank lending
towards areas where it can support the Government's efforts to strengthen
institutions and pursue sound economic policies. Such is the case with regard
to investment planning and finance in the power sector (see para. 10 below).
Thirdly, we hope to select projects which will help Brazil overcome the most
critical constraint on economic growth, namely, the balance of payments.   This
means support of export-oriented investments such as the MBR iron ore project
or of import substituting industry where, as in the case of steel, Brazil has
a significant comparative advantage. Fourthly, in selecting projects for
financing, a concerted effort is being made to identify projects that will
foster the growth of the less developed parts of Brazil, particularly the
Northeast, and reduce regional income disparities.
10.       In earlier years, Bank lending in Brazil was concentrated in the
power sector. Since 1949 the Bank has made 23 loans totalling $692 million
to the sector. About $182 million were for distribution projects and the
balance for 13 hydroelectric generation projects. Most of these projects
are in the South-Central region of Brazil, power development in the Northeast
having been financed by the Inter-American Development Bank. A relatively
small part of the Bank's lending in Brazil in the next few years will be
devoted to the power sector, but this lending will be designed to help



-4 -
Brazil accomplish several important objectives.  As stated above, by asso-
ciating Bank funds with financing from other external lenders.., the Bank is.
helping Brazil to obtain the external capital inflow which it.needs to
sustain a high rate of economic growth. In addition, Bank lending supports
the Government's efforts to build strong and.efficient powerc enterprises,
to maintain power rate policies that enable the sector to generate a sub-
stantial proportion of the funds needed to meet its investment requirements,
and to carry out rational planning of power investments. Proposed.Bank
lending in the power sector represents only a. very small percentages (less
than 5 percent) of total investment in the sector,, the bulk.of the financing
being provided by earnings.
11.       The Sao;Simao project was appraised in September and October 1971.
Negotiations took place from April 3.to April 11,.1972.  The Government of
Brazil was. represented by Dr. Jayme Alipio de Barros, GeneraL Counsel of.
the Ministry of Finance'; CEMIG was represented by Dr., Camilo Penna&, President,
who also represented the State of Minas Gerais.
PART III - THE POWER. SECTOR
12.       BrazilIs electric power sector is one of the largest in the devel-
oping world: installed: capacity in 1970 was 11,200 WT, exc.eeded only by
that of India. The bulk (about 70 percent) of electric power in Brazil is
produced by government entities.  The private sector now. consists almost
entirely of one large campany, Light-Serviqos, de Eletricidade, S..A. (Light),
a subsidiary of the Canadian firm, Brascan,. Ltd.  Light is engaged mainly in
distribution in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.  The Bank has been requested to
make a small loan to Light in order to facilitate its acce.ss, to foreign capital
markets. This project will be appraised in the next.few months...
13.       The electric power sector is regulated by the Yinistry of Mines and
Energy which authorizes development and implementation of power projects.
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, S.A. (ELETROBRAS), a federal holding company
created in 1961 holds the majority of shares in federal power companies;and
has a minority participation in many state companies, including CEMIG.
ELETROBRAS receives about $250 million per year from earmarked tariff sur-
charges and other charges to consumers. These funds. are usedj to finance
investments in the power sector through loans to or equity investment in
various power companies.
14.       Brazilian tariff policy is to provide electric.utilities with
sufficient funds to cover operating expenses and allow a reasonable return
on investment.  AnnuaT revaluation of assets to.reflect the effects of
inflation is mandatory, but it is the responsibility of. individual, enter-
prises to obtain authorizations for the tariff. increases.required. Over
and above the tariffs collected by the conpanies, consumerBrpay additiona-l
sums for taxes and surcharges which are collected by ELETROBRAS and.earmarked
for investment in the electric power sector.



-5-
The South-Central Region
15.       Electricity use in Brazil is concentrated in the South-Central
region,J which accounts for about 80 percent of the countryts installed
generating capacity and is the country's industrial heartland. Generation
and bulk transmission facilities are the responsibility primarily of three
government entities: FURNAS (Furnas-Centrais Eletricas, S.A.), CESP (Centrais
Eletricas de Sao Paulo, S.A.), and the borrower, C3MIG. The resources of
these three companies are predominantly hydroelectric located on the Parana
River and its tributaries.
16.       Interconnected operation of the utilities of the South-Central
region is efficient. A coordination committee has been meeting regularly
since 1969 and has made substantial progress in the coordinated allocation
of reserve capacity.
17.       In order to develop power supply in the South-Central region in a
coordinated manner, the Government in 1963-65 commissioned CANAMBRA (a
consortium of Canadian and U.S. consulting firms), to undertake a compre-
hensive power survey of the region. This study, which was financed by a
UNDP grant, the Bank acting as executing agency, identified a series of low
cost hydroelectric sites and drew up an expansion program for the period
1965-80.  Power development has broadly followed the CANAMBRA guidelines
and a number of projects reconnended have been built or are under con-
struction. Sao Simao is the next project on the program.
18.       Economic growth during the last four years at a faster rate than
was expected has emphasized the need to bring the CANAMBRA study up-to-date.
In addition, there is some evidence that with the more rapid growth the
major power companies in the region may be tempted to plan for individual
self-sufficiency rather than integrated operation. Such a tendency could
lead to overinvestment. To avoid this the Government is now revising the
development plan for generation capacity in the South-Central region and
will use this plan as the basis for granting concessions and authorizing
future investments. This plan will be ready by the end of 1972 and the Bank
will have an opportunity to study and comment on the draft.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
190       A report -- "Appraisal of the Sao Simao Hydroelectric Project,
Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais, S.A." (PU-86a), dated April 27, 1972,
is being distributed separately. A summary of the project is in Annex III.
The Company
20.       CEMIG was established in 1952 as ar. autonomous corporation owned
principally by the State of Minas Gerais. It accounts for almost 80 percent
of the electricity supply of Minas Gerais State, with sales of over 4 billion
kwh to some 420,000 customers. Most of CEMIG's custcmers are in urban areas;
17/ The states of Minas Gerais., Espirnto Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Guanabara and
Sao Paulo.



-6-
a CEMIG subsidiary, Eletrificacao Rural de Minas Gerais, S.A. (ERMIG),.has
been created for construction of rural electrification facilities. ERMIG's
main source of finance is the reinvestment, by the State of Minas Gerais, of
10 percent of the dividends it receives from CEMIG. CEMIG' s share capital
is now owned as to 65 percent by the State of Minas Gerais and certain
municipalities, 15 percent by ELETROBRAS and 20 percent by others. Share
capital and reserves amounts to Cr$1,4660 million ($250 million) and long-
term debt Cr$900 million ($155 million).
21.       CEMIG recently collaborated with the State Government and the
State Development Bank in building up the Industrial Development Institute
(INDI) whose objective is to broaden the State's industrial base by iden-
tifying and evaluating selected industrial opportunities and attracting
investment. A senior official of CEMIG acts as a part-time director of
INDI.
22.       Electricity demand in the State of Minas Gerais is expected to grow
at about 10.5 percent annually. To meet thi9 demand CEMIG must increase its
installed capacity from 1,030 MW in 1970 to 2,850 MW by 1980. 'CEMG has pre-
pared an investment p±rogram for 1972-80, costing an estimated $0.9 billion,
for this purpose; about 55 percent of that amount would be for generation,
15 percent for transmission and 30 percent for distribution. To some extent
CEM'a plans for expansion reflect a concern for self-sufficiency rather than
for coordinated power development in the region. CEKIG will, however, under-
take not to carry out any major expansion of its generation and transmission
facilities without giving the Bank evidence that such expansion would be in
accordance with the Government's development plan for the region (see para. 12
above, and Section 5.65 of the Loan Agreement).
Description of the Ptpject
23.       The project consists of a hydroelectric power station and associated
transmission designed for 2,500 MW with an initial capacity of 1,000 MW, located
on the Paranaiba River. Sao Simao is the first major hydroelectric plant on
the Paranaiba River, which has an average 2,230 m3/second flow. The project
would incorporate a storage reservoir with a usable capacity of 5.5 billion m3
with a catchment area of 171,000 sq. kms. The project location and features
have been chosen on the basis of minimum costs. Geological conditions and
the sources of construction materials have been investigated and found
acceptable.
24.       The project is estimated to cost about $396 million. Cost estimates
were prepared in mid-1971 by consultants, in cooperation with CEMIG, and were
subsequently revised to alldw for the recent realignment in exchange rates.
Local currency costs have been estimated at $269 million and foreign exchange
cost about $127 million.  The Bank loan would finance about 50 percent of the
civil works contract for the hydroelectric station ($59 million) and part of
the engineering services ($1 million). The Bank's share is approximately equal
to the direct and indirect foreign costs of the civil works contract, if won
by a foreign firm. If a Brazilian firm is successful, the Bank would finance
some local currency expenditures, which is Justified by Brazil's external capital
needs.



-7-
Procurement
25.       Discussions between the Bank and CEMIG have led to the conclusion
that Bank financing of civil works would increase the external financing
for this project, since CEMIG would be able to obtain substantial parallel
financing for equipment, whereas civil works do not easily attract such
financing. The civil works would be contracted on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. To ensure that meaningful international
competition takes place, CEMIG and the Brazilian Government have agreed:
(i) that foreign contractors will not be required to associate with a
Brazilian firm in order to bid for this contract, and (ii) that there
will be no obstacles to the importation of construction equipment which
would interfere with the efficient execution of the contract. Contractors
have been invited to prequalify under these conditions.
*.      The equipment for the project, including transmission, would be
procured on the basis of limited international competitive bidding among
nine countries:  Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland,
United Kingdom and the United States, in which ten export development and
supplier finance agencies have indicated willingness to finance equipment
on terms averaging about 15 years. Brazilian manufacturers will participate
with a 15 percent margin of preference and with local financing. To ensure
its timely mobilization, certain construction equipment is being procured by
CEMIG in the United States and financed by a US$3 million loan from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank.
27.       Construction of preliminary works is expected to commence in 1972
and the main civil works contract will start in 1973. The first generating
unit is scheduled for commissioning by December 1977 and all of the first
four units will be installed by early 1979.
Ecological Aspects
28.       The ecological effects of the Sao Simao project have been studied
and it appears that the environmental damage would be minimal. The cost of
the measures to be taken to protect the environment will be an insignificant
part of the projectts total cost.
Financing Plan
29i3      The financing of Sao Simao would be provided from the following
s .arces:
$ millions     %
IBRD Lcan                                     60.0      15.2
Eximbank (Construction Equipment and
part of Engineering)                 6.o       1.5
Parallel Credits                              65.o      16.4
EIXTROBRAS Loan                              120.0      30.3
CENIG's Funds                                144.8      36.6
TOTAL                              395.8     100.0
m    L



30.       Financing from Eximbank and ELETROBRAS has already been arranged
and CEMIG's internal cash generation should be adequate to meet its pro-
jected share. The Federal Government and the State of Minas Gerais have
also agreed to provide whatever additional funds are needed to ensure com-
pletion of the project.
CEMIG's Financial Situation
31.       Under Brazilian tariff legislation  of 1971, CEMIG is allowed to
charge rates to give a return of between 10 and 12 percent on remunerable
assets. In addition it collects the taxes and surcharges mentioned in
paragraph 14. CEMIG's operating costs are in line with those of comparable
companies and CEMIG is able to supply power at the relatively low price of
1.2 U.S. cents/kwh. CEMIG has agreed to apply for needed tariff increases
within five months of the end of each calendar year.
32.       By law,., the State of Minas Gerais is required to reinvest in the
company 80 percent of the dividends it is entitled to receive from its share-
holdings in CEMIG. These reinvestments, together with the ample internal
cash generation, have enabled CEMIG to maintain a favorable capitalization,
with equity representing over 60 percent of capital.
33.       In the previous loan to CEMIG (566 BR), the Bank required that
CEMIG would not incur any debt unless the ratio of its tQtal debt (of more
than one year term) to its total fixed assets remained at a level of less
than two-thirds. The present level is 38 percent, well within the limit.
It would, therefore, be possible for CEMIG to borrow large amounts on terms
that would increase its debt service requirements above its ability to
generate cash. In order to give more direct protection to its creditors,
CEMIG has agreed that, after the period of construction, it will maintain
a debt service coverage of at least 1.5 times.
Justification of the Project
34.       CEMIG's electricity sales increased at an annual average rate of
16 percent per year during 1968-71. Detailed market studies suggest that
the growth rate will drop to about 12 percent per year during the 1970s.
The Sao Simao project is required to prevent shortages in the State of Minas
Gerais in the late 1970s, as well as to help maintain the overall supply and
demand position in the South-Central region. The Sao Simao facility is the
-most economic investment for these purposes and was included in the least
cost solution by the CANAMBRA study of various alternative investment pro-
grams for meeting' electric energy demand. The latest cost estimates confirm
this evaluation. On the assumption that the cost of electricity to the con-
sumer represents a fair estimate of its economic value, the project would have
an economic rate of return of 17 percent.

1/  This definition of Brazil's net external reserves differs from that
of the EVI in excluding liabilities of the monetary authorities arising
from debt rescheduling and from the contracting of external financial
credits by the Bank of Brazil. The Bankts Economic Report classifies
these liabilities as part of Brazil's external debt.
