APPRAISAL OF THE SAO SIMAO HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project of Centrais Eletricas
de Minas Gerais (CEHIG) whose area of supply is in the South-Central Region
of Brazil. The Project consists of the construction of the Sao Simao
hydroelectric plant, with an initial capacity of 1,000 MW, and associated
transmission lines.  Sao Simao is one of the projects suggested in the 1966
CANAMBRA report - a comprehensive power study of South-Central Brazil, financed
by a United Nations Development Programe (UNDP) grant for which the Bank
was Executing Agency. A Bank loan of US$60 million equivalent is proposed
to finance part of the hydroelectric plant's civil works and engineering
services. The Project is estimated to cost US$395.8 million equivalent and
is the major element in the construction program of CEKIG, representing about 50%
of the program's total estimated cost of US$786 million equivalent during
the eight-year construction period, 1972-1979. It would help meet the power
demand in the State of Minas Gerais and the South-Central Region.
ii.       This would be the twenty-fourth loan for power in Brazil and the
fourth to CEMIG. Total Bank lending for the electric power sector in Brazil
has been US$692 million, mostly in the South-Central Region which accounts
for 80% of the electricity use, and where with the support of the Government
and the agencies involved it has been an important factor in ensuring the
most economic development of power facilities and in fostering sound institu-
tional development of the sector. In connection with the proposed loan,
the Government and the Borrower have given appropriate undertakings in
this respect.
iii.      CEMIG, created in 1952 as an autonomous corporation owned principally
by the State of Minas Gerais, is responsible for the electricity supply in
that State. The corporation is efficiently managed and functions well. It
would be capable, with the assistance of consultants, of carrying out the
very large Sao Simao project.
iv.       Financing of civil works by the Bank is expected to make the best
use of external financing for the Project, as suppliers' credit financing
for major equipment is anticipated. The civil works contract would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's procurement requirements. Brazilian contractors would compete but,
in accordance with the usual Bank practice for civil works, without any
preference. As the contract would be large -- about US$120 million equivalent --
it is expected to attract conaiderable attention from international contractors.
Prequalification of contractors has been invited.
v.        CEMIG's finances are sound. With the assistance of the proposed
Bank loan, a local ourrency loan of about US$120 million equivalent from the
Federal Power Agency (Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, S.A. - ELETROBRAS),



- ii -
and suppliers' credits for the major equipment, no difficulties are foreseen
in financing the Project.
vi.       The Project is the least-cost alternative for meeting the load
growth requirements of the State of Ninas Gerais.  The internal economiC
return is about 17%.
vii.      The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$60 million equivalent,
for a term of 30 years including a seven-year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF THE SAO SIMAO HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Brazilian Government on behalf of Contrais Eletricas de Minas
Gerais, S.A. (CEHIG), a corporation owned principally by the State of Minas
Gerais, has asked the Bank to help finance the Sao Simao project consisting
of a 1,000 MW power station, constructed for an ultimate capacity of 2,500
MW, on the Paranaiba River and associated 500 kV transmission lines.
1.02      A loan of US$60 million equivalent is proposed and would be used
to finance part of the civil works of the hydroelectric station and the
foreign exchange cost of the engineering services. It would cover about
47% of the Project's foreign cost component and about 15% of the total Project
cost of US$395.8 million equivalent. The prospeotive Bank loan would represent
about 8% of CEZ4I&s capital investment program of US$786 million equivalent
for 1972-1979, the Project construction period.
1.03      Discussions with the Borrower as to whether the proposed Bank loan
should finance civil works or equipment have led to the conclusion that
financing civil works would optimize external financing for this very large
project, since CEMIG would be able to obtain substantial supplier credit
financing for equipment, whereas civil works do not lend themselves to
supplier credit financing.
1.04      Three previous Bank loans have been made to CEMIG.  Loan 76-BR
(US$7.3 million) in 1953 for the Itutinga hydroelectric project; Loan 442-BR
(US$49 million) in 1966 was for the Jaguara hydroelectric project, which was
recently commissioned; and Loan 566-BR (US$22.6 million) in 1968 for the
Volta Grande hydroelectric project currently under construction. The Bank's
experience with these projects and with the Borrower has been satisfactory
to date.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission composed of
Messrs. J. Beach, C.K. Chandran and K. Stichenwirth who visited Brazil in
September/October 1971.



II. THE POWER SECTOR
Economic Background
2.01      Brazil is one of the world's most plentifully endowed countries,
with abundant mineral resources, great river systems and large tracts of
land suitable for agriculture and forestry.  An enterprising managerial                    *
class enhances the growth of the industrial sector, which acqqunts for
about one-third of GNP. Despite political unrest, inflationY and price
fluctuations in the principal exports, the econouy has shown considerable
resilience and in recent years has responded positively to rational economic
management. The country has a population of about 93 million, growing at
an annual rate of 2.8%.
2.02      In 1971 Brazil's econony grew by 11.3%, compared with 9.5% in
1970 and 9.0% in 1969. The industrial output increased at an annual average
of 12.5% thus leading all other sectors. The Government's objective is to
maintain an economic growth rate of the order of 8-9% throughout the 1970w.
2.03      With its abundance of mineral and other natural resources, the
State of Minas Gerais has a key role in the development of Brazil's basic
industries. It is responsible for all of the iron ore and nickel production,
75% of the ferroalloys, 50% of the aluminum and zinc, and 40% of the steel
production in Brazil. The power demand is mainly industrial (70% of the State
total), and within the State are located manr electricity-intensive industries
whose growth is vital to the country's industrial development.
Organization of the Power Sector
2.04      The power sector in Brazil is organized into Federal, State and
private concessionaires. Federal and State utilities accounted for about
70% of the country's total installed capacity of 11,200 MW in 1970. The
private segment of the power sector now consists almost entirely of one
large comparn, Light-Servicos de Eletricidade S.A. of Rio de Janeiro and
Sao Paulo, a subsidiary of a Canadian firm.
2.05      For power purposes, there are five main regions in Brazil:  South,
South-Central, Central-West, North-East and North. The most important is
the South-Central Region comprising the five States of Ninas Geraia, Sao Paulo,
Guanabara, Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo and accounting for about 80% of
the country's installed capacity. The Borrower's system accounts for about
20% of the capacity of the South-Central Region.
2.06      The power sector is regulated by the Federal Ministry of Mines and
Energy, which among other responsibilities authorizes development and imple-
mentation of power projects. Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (ELETROBRAS),
a federal holding company created in 1961, administers power projects and
1/ In 1971 prices increased by about 20%. The cruseiro is revalued at
frequent intervals throughout the year.



facilities under federal ownership and assists in their financing and that
of some state enterprises including CEMIG. It collects and relends funds
for this purpose. ELETROBRAS holds the majority of shares in the federally
owned companies and controls them.
The South-Central Region
2.07      There are 12 power utilities operating interconnected in the
South-Central Region. Generation and bulk transmdission facilities are the
responsibility primarily of three government entities: Furnas - Centrais
Eletricas S.A. (FURNAS), Centrais Eletricas de Sao Paulo S.A. (CESP), and
Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais (CEMIG). FURNAS is a bulk supplier,
whereas CESP and CEMIG are responsible for both bulk and retail supply.
2.08      The resources of these three companies are predominantly hydro-
electric, mainly on the Parana River system and its tributaries. Their
supply areas are contiguous (see Maps No. 1-2) and have been defined by
mutual agreement. CEMIG is owned chiefly by the State of Minas Gerais and
responsible for that State's power supply; CESP is owned by the State of
Sao Paulo and is responsible for the bulk of that State's supply, the balance
coming from Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz (PAULISTA) and from FURNAS.
FIUNAS, owned by ELETROBRAS, is responsible for bulk supplies in the States
of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro and in Braailia and adjacent areas, and for
partial supply of the city of Sao Paulo and the State of Espirito Santo.
2.09      In order to developw,pover supply in the South-Central Region in a
coordinated manner, CANAMBRA_ undertook a comprehensive power survey,
including a detailed assessment of the Region's water power resources,
during 1963-1965 under a UNDP grant, for which the Bank was Executing Agency.
This study identified a series of low-cost hydroelectric sitea from which
CANAMBRA drew up a program of expansion, predominantly bydroelectric, for
the period 1965-1980. Power development in the Region has broadly followed
the CANAMBRA Report and a number of the projects recommended have been built
or are under construction. Sao Simao is the next indicated project in the
program.
2.10      Interconnected operation of the utilities of the South-Central
Region has been marked by gradually increasing efficiency. A Committee
for the Coordination of Operation has been meeting regularly since 1969 and
has made substantial progress in such matters as allocation of reserve capacity.
The Committee was particularly effective during 1971, a critically poor water
year, in coordinating interchanges of power and reservoir operation to avoid
power curtailment.
2.11      On the whole, power generation in the South-Central Region has
broadly followed the CANAMBRA plan. In 1969 ELETROBRAS made a complete
restudy of load growth, which has since been the basis for the development
program in the Region. However, in system planning and the coordination of
power investments there is evidence of an emerging drift away from the CANAMBRA
concept of rational choice of generation sources and development of a well-integrate
1/ A consortium of Canadian and American consulting firms.



Regional power transmission system. Thus the installation of large thermal
generating facilities in the Region, not foreseen in the CANAMBRA Report is
under consideration. They may yet be justified on the basis of studies
(paragraph 2.12) but there are other considerations. Thus to scme extent,
CESP and CENIG owned by powerful and important states are tending toward
individual self-sufficiency as their system sizes becoae large. Given the
resources and political importance of these States, the Federal Government--
and ELETROBRAS--cannot dictate the development programs of the State Companies.
Another consideration, at the Federal Government level, is that the purchase
of large thermal stations on a bilateral credit basis would provide, in return,
an export outlet for Brazilian commodities such as iron ore now in temporary
oversupply. The thermal stations would also help utilize the residual oil,
heavy fraction product, from Brazilian refineries which otherwise might be
in excess supply. In any event, it is believed that an updated plan seeking
to continue the efficient coordinated operation of all power facilities
in the South Central Region would be useful.
2.12      In the circumstances described in paragraph 2.11, there is the
risk of over-investment through lack of investment coordination and the
Government has therefore agreed to authorize and/or implement future gen-
eration projects only in accordance with a South Central Region Generation
Development Plan based on the efficient and coordinated operation of the
generating facilities in the South-Central Region. This would make explicit
the context in which recent loans for power have been made, that is, within
the framework of the development plan. For this purpose, it is in the
process of updating the CANAMERA study; the Plan is expected to be available
by the end of 1972 ahd the Bank will be given the opportunity of commenting
upon it. The Borrower and its owner, the State of Minas Gerais, have also
agreed to adhere to that Plan. It would be the intention if further power
loans are made to other utilities to seek undertakings along the lines
described above, in effect providing a broad accord on implementation of the
official development program.
Tariffs
2.13      Brazilian tariff policy has been to provide electric utilities with
sufficient funds to cover their operating expenses and, in addition, to allow
a reasonable return on their investment. Under Brazilian legislation a rate
of return of up to 10% on remunerable investment (revalued assets in opera-
tion plus various current assets) was in effect through 1971. As a result
of changes introduced in this legislation in May 1971 (Annex 14), a rate of
return of not less than 10% and not more than 12% will be permitted beginning
1972. Surcharges to cover increases in operating costs and in foreign debt
service can continue to be made automatically. Ultimate consumers will pay
additional sums on electricity bills for taxes and the compulsory loans
(see Annex 14), the proceeds of which are collected, and used for plant
expansion, by ELETROBRAS.



- 5 -
2.14      Until 1971 the utilities had the choice in their tariff applications
of charging in addition to depreciation, either "amortization" 1/ (up to 5%
of fixed assets in operation which they could retain as part of their internal
finances) or "reversion" j (up to 3% of fixed assets in operation which they
have to turn over to ELETROBRAS). The new law permits the utilities to charge
only "reversion" which will be turned over to ELETROBRAS and will account
for a large portion of its revenues and strengthen its finances. ELETROBRAS
relends funds derived from "reversion" at an interest rate of 10%.
2.15      The new law's imrpact on the finances of some power utilities can
be substantial since the increased rate of return makes up only in part for
the loss through cancellation of the "amortization" provision.  CEMIG, however,
is not affected by the change since its generally favorable financial position
has not, except for the year 1971, required it to charge "amortization" in
order to increase its revenues.
2.16      As outlined in Annex 14, annual revaluation of assets to reflect
the effects of inflation is mandatory whereas related applications for tariff
increases are not. Therefore , as in the Bank's earlier power loans in Brazil,
CEMIG has agreed to continue maintaining its earnings at levels consistent
with sound financial and public utility practices in accordance with Brazilian
legislation, that it will apply for appropriate tariff adjustments no later
than five months after the end of each calendar year, and that the Government
will continue to act promptly on these tariff applications. Any change in the
Brazilian legislation which, in the Bank's opinion, would adversely affect the
Borrower's financial position continue to be considered an event of default,
as is the case under existing loan agreements.

III. THE BORROWER
Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais (CEM[G)
3.01      CEMIG, the prospective Borrower, was established in 1952 as an
autonomous corporation owned principally by the State of Minas Gerais. As the
entity responsible for the public power supply, CEMIG is charged with
generation, transmission and distribution of electric energy throughout that
State.
3.02      As of December 31, 1970, CEMIG's total share capital was Cr$531
million, representing 354 million shares (Cr$1.50 each) as shown below.

Total                     232,000,000    122,000,000        100.0%
In view of the important coordinating function fulfilled by ELETROBRAS
as an agency of the Brazilian Government, it has agreed to restore to
and maintain at 16% its level of participation in CEMIG's share capital
in accordance with the terms of an earlier loan to CEMIG (U42-BR).
CENIG's Market
3.03      CEMIG, at present, accounts for more than 77% of the State's total
electricity supply, with sales of over h billion kWh. It serves directly
418,000 customers including bulk supply to several concessionaires. The
market characteristics are as follows:
1970
Number of            Consumption
Customers           GWh         %
Residential              337,000            278        6.7

418,000          4,153      100.0
3.04      For the promotion and construction of rural electrification
facilities, Eletrificacio Rural de Minas Gerais, S.A. (ERMIG) has been



- 7 -
created as CEMIG's subsidiary. This company is in effect a department of
CEMIG, operated mainly by CENIG staff for the purpose of rural electrification.
ERMIG is financed chiefly by the investment in the company of 10% of the
dividends to the State of Minas Gerais from CEMIG.
3.05      CENIG recently collaborated with the State Government and the State
Development Bank in building up the Industrial Development Insitute (INDI),
whose objective is to broaden the State's industrial base by identifying and
evaluating selected industrial opportunities and attracting national and
private capital investment. The Institute has a data bank which maintains
detailed information on the State's natural resources, infrastructure,
financial resources, existing industries, etc. -- all of which are useful to
CEMIG in projecting market demand and planning its investment program. A
senior official of CEMIG functions as a part-time director of INDI.
Organization of C!MIG
3.06      CEMIG's organizational setup is shown in Annex 1.  The corporation
is well managed and efficiently operated. A ten-member Board of Directors
determines general policy. Responsibility for operating CENIG rests with
its General Manager, who has six principal assistants.
3.07      The corporation employs a staff of 5,100, which is a reasonable
number in view of the scope of its responsibilities (see paragraph 3.08).
The engineering staff is competent, but for the design and construction of
major projects CEMIG hires consulting engineers and contractors. Its
training program is efficient and includes a school to train operators and
maintenance staff.
CEMIG's Facilities
3.08      CEMIGts area of 5esponsibility is the entire State of Minas Gerais,
with an area of 580,000 km . In 1970 the corporation provided 4,500 GWh, or
77% of the State's total production of 5,800 GWh; it generated 3,540 GWh from
its installations, which totaled 676 MW. Its extensive transmission network
serves over 500 localities and 400,000 consumers.  This network includes
7,500 km of lines in voltages ranging between 345 and 69 kV, 4,800 km of
13.2 kV distribution lines, and more than 13,000 km of urban and rural
networks.
3.09      CEMIG's generating facilities, existing an(d under construction, are
listed in Annex 2. In addition to its own power stations which, with the
recent commissioning of Jaguara station now aggregate 1,132 MW, the
corporation has contracted for one-half the output of the Furnas hydroelectric
station and by 1975 will receive 450 MW; it is considering increasing the
contract to 600 MW, as the Furnas station is being expanded to 1,200 MW. The
decision is directly relevant to CEMIG's expansion program to meet interim
shortages before commissioning of the Sao Simao project.
CEMIG's Expansion Program
3.10      The projected average growth in demand of 10.5% annually in the State



would increase the demand from 1,030 MW in 1970 to 2,850 MW by 1980. To
meet this higher demand, CEMIG has prepared an expansion program (1972-
1980) with an estimated cost of Cr$5.4 billion (US$0.9 billion). About
55% of that amount would be for generation, 15% for transmission, and
30% for distribution; this is reasonable.
3.11      The program includes:
(i) completion of the 456 MW Jaguara and the 440 MW Volta Grande
hydroelectric projects;
(ii)  the 1,000 MW Sao Simao project;
(iii)  a possible new 125 MW thermal station.
The purchase of additional power from FURNAS and augmentation of generating
capacity at CEMIG's Jaguara hydro station to meet interim shortages of
capacity and energy anticipated during 1976 and 1977 might make construction
of the thermal station unneceesary. CEMIG has the matter under study.
3.12      To some degree CEMIG's plans for expansion of generating facilities
are tending to be made on the basis of utility self-sufficiency rather than
from the point of view of a coordinated development of projects in the Region.
Such an approach could vitiate the rational approach to power development,
hitherto adopted, and lead to overinvestment. In the context of this finding
and the observations in paragraph 2.11, CEMIG agreed not to carry out any major
programs of expansion of its generation and transmission facilities without
giving the Bank evidence that such expansion is in accord with the coordinated
development plan for such facilities in South-Central Brazil and that adequate
financial resources are available. For this purpose major schemes of generation
and transmission expansion are defined as those whose cost exceeds 1% of the
gross fixed assets in operation plus work in progress.
3.13      CEMIG's program of transmission expansion covers about 2,500 km of
500/345 kV lines, 7,400 km of sub-transmission lines (230 kV and below), and
over 5,000 MVA of step-down transformers. On the distribution side, about
5,200 km of 13.2 kV lines and 11,500 km of urban networks are to be added to
extend CEMG's service to 200 new locations and 450,000 new consumers.

IV. THE PROJECT
4.01      The Project consists of a hydroelectric power station designed
for 2,500 MW with an initial installation of 1,000 KW, located on the
Paranaiba River, and associated 500 kV transmission. Sao Simao is the
first major hyd5oelectric facility on the Paranaiba River, which has an
average 2,230 m /second flow and would inco rorate a storage reservoir with
a usable storage capacity of 5,500 million mJ, regulating a catchment area
of 171,000 sq km. The annual average dependable energy production of
Sao Simao, with 1,000 MW initial capacity, would be 6,650 OWh. This would
increase to 8,300 GWh when the station's capacity is ultimately raised
to 2,500 MW. The demand pattern and system conditions permit initial
operation of Sao Simao as a base load station, and ultimately require
its operation at a plant factor of about 33%. This is appropriate and
the station and reservoir have been planned accordingly.
4.02      CEMIG's main system operates at 345 kV at present.  500 kV has
been chosen for Sao Simao, in view of the very large amount of power to be
transmitted and the distance involved. FURNAS has also adopted this voltage
for the 1,400 MW Marimbondo project. The tentative plan of CEMIG consists
of two lines from Sao Simao directly to Belo Horizonte. However, CENIG is
considering an alternative plan for linking Sao Simao with Belo Horizonte
via the Marimbondo hydroelectric plant switching station which would
improve reliability of supply. The Project cost estimate provides for the
latter. CEMIG's program of transmission and distribution expansion during
1971-1980 would be adequate to market Sao Simao power.
4.03      The main features of the Project are:
(i) The main dam comprisings
(a) concrete spillway and intake sections involving
2 million mna of concrete work; and
(b) rockfill embankments changing to earth fill
sections on both banks, involving 20 million m3
of fill.
(ii)  A conventional indoor type power station with 10 generating
units rated at 250 MW each, of which 4 are to be installed
initially.
(iii)  Two 500 kV single circuit lines, each 730 km in length,
with a 1,200 MVA sub-station at Belo Horizonte, and two
switching stations enroute.
IL4Cineerino and Construction
4.04      In addition to feasibility studies undertaken  by CANAMBRA in 1965,
further detailed investigations of alternative sites have been carried out
for Sao Simao by CEMIG, which has considerable experience from previous
projects, with the help of consulting engineering firms.  The project location



- 10 -
and features have been chosen on the basis of minimum costs. Geological
conditions and the sources of construction materials have been investigated
in sufficient detail by the consulting engineers, Companhia Internacional
de Engenharia, to prepare realistic designs and cost estimates. CEMIG in-
tends to utilize a US$3.0 million Export-Import Bank of USA credit to finance
part of the estimated US$4.O million foreign exchange cost of engineering
services. The remaining US$1.0 million would be financed from the proposed
loan. CEKIG has agreed that it will continue to employ engineering con-
sultants satisfactory to the Bank and, under terms and conditions satis-
factory to it.
4.o5      Installation of the generating plant and other electrical equip-
ment will be carried out by CEKIG, as has been its successful practice in
earlier projects.
Civil Works
4.o6      The preliminary work relating to the construction camps would be
handled by CEKIG with the help of local contractors. The main civil works
for the hydroelectric facility would be carried out by a construction firm
to be selected on the basis of international competitive bidding. In the
recent past, Bank loans for power in Brazil have financed equipment rather
than civil works, partly because of the difficulties faced by foreign con-
tractors in undertaking civil works construction in that country. The more
important issues were: (i) inability to import, free of duty or other
levies, construction equipment, new or used, required by foreign firms for
the project; and (ii) required association of foreign bidders with a
Brazilian firm. These question have been examined with the Borrower and
representatives of the Brazilian Government. The Brazilian Government in-
tends to issue prior to the calling of tenders for civil works, a decree
providing that construction equipment for the project - which would be re-
quired for a construction period of about 6 years - can be imported by
Brazilian or foreign bidders, free of duties or other levies. On completion
of the job the equipment could be removed freely from Brazil by the con-
tractor. CEKIG has undertaken to assist successful foreign bidders in lim-
iting entry delays of imported equipment to 21 days. Foreign bidders will
not be required to associate with local contractors though they would be
encouraged to do so. These conditions, which clear the ground for meaning-
ful international competitive bidding for the Project's civil works, would
be incorporated in the bidding documents and contractors have been invited
by the Borrower to prequalify themselves on the basis of these conditions.
4.07      Construction of the preliminary works is expected to commence in
1972, and the main civil works contractor is expected to start work in the
field in 1973. The first generating unit is scheduled for commissioning
by December 1977 and the entire initial installation by early 1979. Assur-
ances have also been obtained that the Borrower will engage for the Sao
Simao civil works a contractor who is satisfactory to the Bank, under terms
and conditions acceptable to it.
4.08      The cost estimates were prepared in detail in mid-1971 by the
consultants, in collaboration with CEDG. These estimates were subsequently
revised to allow for the realignment of exchange rates. Adequate provisions
have been made for physical contingencies, taking into consideration the
detailed engineering on which the estimates are based. These physical con-



- 11 -
tingencies are equivalent to 7% on the cost of land and relocati.ns, 15% on
the cost of civil works, and 5% on the cost of power station equipment. On
transmission, larger-than-usual physical contingencies have been provided --
10% of the cost of equipment and materials -- to cover possible route re-
alignments. To cover price escalations in foreign markets during the Project
construction period, a price contingency of 15% (anticipating price increases
of 5% per year during the main 6-year construction period) has been included
in the cost estimate.; price escalations in the Brazilian market are sub-
stantially covered by the annual revaluation mechanism (paragraph 2.16)
and it suffices therefore to provide a contingency of 5% of local costs to
cover the effect of delays between actual price increase and the effect of
the revaluation.

Amount of Proposed Loan
4.10      The cost of the Project is estimated at US$395.8 million equivalent
with an estimated foreign exchange content of about US$127 million or 32% of
the total cost. The loan amount would be US$60 million, comprising US$59
million for the civil works contract for the hydroelectric station (repre-
senting about 50% of ita cost including contingencies and approximately equal
to its direct and indirect foreign exchange cost) and US$1 million for part
of the foreign exchange cost of engineering services.



- 12 -
Unit Costs
4.11      The coat per kW installed of the initial 1,000 MW stage  f Sao
Simao project would be US$301 for the hydroelectric plant and US$3 6 when
the 500 kV transmission to the load center is included. The cost per kW for
the hydroelectric station would be lowered to about US$156 when its full
capacity of 2,500 MW is installed. This is very low and represents an
attractive investment.
Procurement and Disburaement
4.12      The proposed loan would finance part of the civil works construction
contract and also a part of the foreign cost of engineering services which
would be required over and above the provisions of the Export-Import Bank
loan (paragraph 4.04). The civil works would be contracted for on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's procure-
ment guidelines. Disbursements for civil works would be made against 50% of
the amount billed in the contractor's periodic invoices, to the full amount
of US$59 million (paragraph 4.10). If the civil works contract proves equal
to or more than the estimate, the full $59 million amount would be disbursed,
although in the latter case the percentage would be modified to enable the
full amount of the loan to be disbursed over the full constructioi.period.
However, having established 50% as the basis for the disbursement of the $59
million amount, less than $59 million would be disbursed if the cost of the
civil works proves below that estimated. Disbursements would be made against
the actual foreign costs of engineering services.  No disbursements would be
made for costs incurred prior to signing of the loan. Any loan funds re-
maining undisbursed upon completion of the Project would be cancelled unless
their disbursement on other works associated with the project is appropriate.
The schedule of disbursements is given in Annex 10.
4.13      The equipment required for the rest of the Project, including
transmission, would be procured on the basis of competitive bidding among11
nine countries, where ten export finance, development, supplier agencies-
have indicated their willingness to finance equipment on credit terms.
Administrative arrangements are being made to enable Brazilian equipment
manufacturers to participate in this bidding, with a 15% margin of preference
(see Annex 15). To permit timely mobilization for the project certain con-
struction equipment would be procured directly by CEMIG through a US$3 million
loan from the US Export-Import Bank.
Ecological Aspects
4.14      The ecological effect of the Sao Sinao project was studied by a
competent ecologist, who concluded that environmental degradation would be

minimal. The only ecological effect of any importance would be the drowning
of a scenic gorge in the Paranaiba River by the reservoir; however, this is
not now nor is likely to become an important tourist attraction, in view of
the inaccessibility and distance of the site from population centers. CEKIG
has indicated its readiness to comply with the ecologist's recommendations,
which would not be costly or difficult to carry out (see Annex 8).

V. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJFCr
Load Growth
5.01      CEMIG's electricity sales increased at an average annual rate of
about 16% during 1968-1971 with increases of 12.5% in 1969, 17.2% in 1970
and 19.4% in 1971. The high rate of growth in the last few years followed
a period of economic stagnation. Detailed market studies of CEMIG show that
the high rate of recent growth is unlikely to continue; an average rate of
increase of 12% per year has therefore been forecast for the period 1972-1980.
5.02      Industrial sales, which account for about 70% of the total and
are expected to continue to do so, have been projected by CEMIG on the basis
of the known industrial expansion programs, making particular use of INDI's
studies of future industrial development. Residential and other forms of
consumption have been analyzed separately.
5.03      The requirements of the State of Minas Gerais up to 1985 were
studied independently by ELETROBRAS in detail in 1969 as part of an overall
study of power requirements in South-Central Brazil conducted at the instance
of the Bank. An average growth in sales of 10.5% annually for the entire
State was forecast. Given that CEMIG's share of electricity sales in the
State of NMnas Gerais is expected to increase from the present 77% to about
90%, CEMIaG' forecast of 12% annual growth corresponds to that of ELETROBRAS.
In view of past trends, the current economic trends in Brazil (paragraph 2.02)
and the heavy concentration of power-intensive industries in the State of
Minas Gerais, these projections are reasonable.
5.04      By 1980, CEMIG's total energy requirement is expected to reach
16,400 (Wh. The firm potential of CD(IG's power stations presently in
operation and under construction, its share of the Furnas power station
(paragraph 3.09), and the capacity of all the small generating stations
in Minas Gerais would then aggregate about 10,800 GWh. A deficit of the
order of 5,600 GWh in the State would therefore have to be met by CEMIG.
From a demand standpoint a shortage of 1,000 1.M is foreseen. The new power
station would therefore be needed by 1977 (see Annexes 3 and 12).
5.05      The power supply situation in the entire South-Central Region
during 1970-1980 is depicted in Annexes 5 and 6 on the basis of availabili-
ties from the integrated operation of all power producers and the growth of
demand according to ELETROBRAS' median forecasts, which represent the
prevailing outlook. In addition to the expansion schemes already authorized
for execution, including Sao Simao, two new hydro power projects -- Itumbiara
(to be constructed by FURBAS) and Agua Vermelha (by CESP) -- would have to
be authorized soon for commissioning about 1979 if shortages of energy and
capacity in the South-Central Region by 1978-79 are to be avoided (Annexes
5 and 6).
5.o6      The Project is therefore required both to meet the anticipated
shortages in the State of Ninas Gerais in 1977, as well as to help maintain
the overall supply and demand position in the South-Central Region.



- 15 -
Least-Cost Solution
5.07      As noted in paragraph 2.01, Brazil is abundantly endowed with
large rivers whose regimes make them particularly suitable for development
as sources of energy for the expanding markets of the country. The survey
carried out by CANAMERA, mentioned in paragraph 2.09, revealed that for a
planning horizon of about 15/20 years to 1980/85 the hydroelectric resources
of the south central region were so attractive economically and so suited
to the characteristics of the region's markets, that all the sites identified
in the course of the survey should be developed sequentially. It was estab-
lished on the basis of the preliminary cost estimates to develop these sites,
expected market developments, cost of fuel, and system load factors, that
virtually no thermal capacity could be Justified, provided the opportunity
cost of capital for the electric power sector was not greater than about 10%.
Subsequent reviews of the load/capacity situation carried out by Brazilian
agencies and by the Bank confirm that the all-hydro CANAMERA program continues
to represent the least-cost development strategy, with the Sao Simao project
the appropriate next capacity addition.
Internal Economic Return
5.08      The internal economic return for Sao Simao (see Annex 9) is the
discount rate at which the present worth of its associated system costs,
including capital and operating costs but excluding taxes and depreciation,
is equal to the present worth of the associated system revenues to be obtained
over its lifetime, assuming this to be 4h years. Associated system revenues
plus applicable direct taxes on electricity bills (paragraph 2.13) are used
as a minimum value of the associated economic benefits. Costs also include
the capital and operating costs of transmission and distribution attributable
to the Project.
5.09      The internal economic return is estimated at about 17%. Since under
Brazilian tariff regulations the utility is in effect guaranteed a fixed rate
of return regardless of capital or operating costs (paragraph 2.13), sub-
stantial changes in the cost of Sao Simao, or in sales attributable to it,
would be reflected in compensating tariff changes in due course. Thus the
element of risk insofar as the internal economic return on the project is //
concerned is not present, to the extent it applies to power projects in
other countries.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
6.01      CEMIG's sound financial position and prospects are assured by
provisions of Brazilian tariff legislation (see paragraphs 2.13, 2.16 and
Annex 1h), which make it possible for CEMIG to earn a reasonable return on
investments. With its prudent choice of low-cost hydro investments, CEMIG
is also able to supply power at a relatively low price (on an average of
about 1.2U30/kWh).
6.02      Since a guaranteed rate-of-return could make utilities less cost-
conscious than they ought to be, the Brazilian authorities are considering
such measures as control of operating expenses, over which, except for the
level of depreciation, no control exists at present. Such measures, however,
would have little effect on CEMIG's operating costs which are at appropriate
levelE in line with normal public utilities' practices.
Past and Present Financial Situation
6.03      Earnings of CEMIG have been satisfactory in recent years, although
it has not always achieved the maximum allowable return of 10%. In the
interests of its consumers, CENIG has requested tariff increases of lesser
amount than would provide the maximum return but adequate to maintain a
satisfactory position. To the extent that realized earnings are less than
those applied for under the allowable rate of return on remunerable
investment (see Annex 1h), the shortfall can be r.oovered  in the subsequent
year. CEMIGts 1971 tariff application, for instance, inciuded provision to
reoover   the Cr$14 million shortfall experienced ih 1970.
6.04      CEMIG's power sales increased from 3,542 GWh in 1969 to 4,965 GWh
in 1971, representing a growth of about 17% in 1970 and 19% in 1971. The
average revenues per kWh sold rose by 49% from 4.9 centavos to 7.3 centavos,
in this period during which the national price index rose by about 50%.
6.05      From 1969 to 1971, fixed assets in operation increased from about
Cr$757 million to Cr$1,499 million, virtually doubling in two years. Of
the total increase of about Cr$742 million, the larger part represents gains
due to mandatory revaluation of assets on the basis of economic coefficients
published annually by the Government.
6.o6      The generous allowable earnings, along with legislation of the  State
of Minas Gerais concerning re-investment of dividends as share capital (see
Annex 12 page 3), and a prudent borrowing policy, have enabled CEKIG to miaintain a
favornble capita]ization, with equity representing over 60% of the total
capitalization as shown in the aummarized figures for 1971 belows

6.07      The ratio of the revalued long-term debt to net fixed assets in
operation plus work in progress is well within the 66-2/3 ratio stipulated in
Loan 566-BR; it is 39% and is not expected to move above 45% during the period
covered by this report. This favorable situation reflects the high proportion
of capital expenditures financed by internally generated funds and from in-
creases in share capital, which keep borrowings at lower levels than normally
expected in a utility with a high rate of expansion. It is therefore proposed
to replace the present debt/asset-ratio covenant by a conventional covenant
on debt service coverage (paragraph 6.23).
6.08      The equity consists of shares subscribed to by the shareholders and
the revaluation reserve, which is a pool for the balancing amounts remaining
in the revaluation process (paragraph 6.05) after allowing for revaluation of
the foreign debt at the prevailing rate of exchange. At the discretion of
CFEIG's shareholders, the revaluation reserve can be converted into share
capital. The legal reserve allocations consist of 5% of the annual net
income before dividends. The remainder of the equity is made of accumulated
surplus and other small reserves.
6.09      The total long-term debt (see Annex 13) is composed of various
foreign loans at interest rates between 5% and 11% with repayment periods of
11-20 years, and local loans at interest rates between 6% and 12% with
repayment periods of 10-17 years.
Financing Plan
6.1o      Annex 12 shows in detail CEMIG' s financing plan for 1972 through
1980 which assumes the lowest allowable rate of return (10%) on remunerable
investment under the legislation in order to keep tariffs at levels as low
as reasonably possible. A condensed version for the estimated Project
construction period (1972-1979) is given below.

6.11      During the Project construction period, internal cash genera;- rE
after dividends is expected to finance about 35% of CEMIG's total investment
program plus variations in working capital, under the assumption that CE]IG
will earn a 10% return on its remunerable investment. Out of the 65% financing
to be external, CEMIG expects to cover about 20% by increases of share capital
other than re-invested dividends. These new equity funds are derived from
State-invested "sole" tax revenues (see Annex 14) and new issues in the local
market. About 10% is expected to be financed by the proposed Bank loan and the
drawdown of earlier Bank loans, about 7% by suppliers' credits for Sao Simao
under the proposed parallel financing (averaging 15 years terms and interest
of 7%) and about 20% by ELETROBRAS loans (at averaged 25 years terms and in-
terest of 7%). Various other loans, still to be contracted, but which are
not required to complete the financing of the Project itself, are expected
to make up the balance of about 8%. The financing plan, outlined above, is
reasonable, particularly with the Federal and State Governments' agreements to
provide funds as required in case a shortage of funds arises which might
endanger the carrying out of the Project.
Particular Issues Concerning the Project Financing
6.12      The financing of Sao Simao is envisaged to be covered by the
proposed Bank loan, suppliers' credits under a parallel financing arrangement
for the main equipment items (paragraph 6.14), a US Eximbank loan for initial
construction equipment,,and part of engineering, an ELETROBRAS loan and CEMIG's
own funds, as shown below.

CEMIG's Own Funds              839.9           144.8          36.6
Total Financing          2,295.7           395.8         100.0
6.13      The proposed Bank loan would finance about 50% of the main civil
works contract and the foreign component of part of the engineering services.
Under this arrangement, maximum foreign financing will be mobilized for the
Project since all of the equipment can be the object of supplier credit financing.
6.14      For financing of equipment, suppliers' credits (paragraph 4.13)
under a parallel financing arrangement are contemplated, on which CEMIG has
reached general agreement with 10 suppliers and export financing agencies.
The financial projections assume that about 75% of the equipment orders will
be financed by such credits, including up to 20% of the local cost component
of such orders, as provided for in preliminary Betters of Intent.   The
remaining 25% would be financed by CEMIG's own funds.
6.15      As explained in detail in Annex 15, under Brazil's "Law of
Similars" any goods or services procured locally as well as abroad are duty
and tax exempt only if, among other provisions, they are purchased under
foreign financing arrangements. Under this law foreign bids can be invited



- 20 -
only if domestic manufacturers of similar equipment are permitted to bid
competitively, which implies that they receive the tax and duty exemption
provided under the law. Bidding procedures for the supplier-financed
equipment which involved only foreign suppliers might not be practicable.
6.16      The Government has therefore decided in principle to declare
CEMIG's own resources (internal cash and share capital increases) as "foreign
funds" up to the amount of the prospective Bank loan, enabling, if necessary,
CEMIG to finance with "foreign funds" orders won by domestic suppliers and
permitting the tax and duty drawbacks applicable to such orders to be obtained.
6.17      ELETROBRAS has made a commitment for a loan to CEMIG of US$120
million eqaivalent (30 years, 10% interest) to finance civil works. It would
also finance interest during construction on this loan, estimated at
US$69.5 million equivalent. The loan would be increased as required in the
future, to reflect redlction in the value of the Brazilian currency due to
inflation.
6.18      With the arrangements outlined above, the Sao Simao financing plan
is reasonable.
Future Financial Situation
6.19      CEMIG's future financial outlook is satisfactory, as indicated
in the projections for the forecast period (see Annexes 11-13).
6.20      Aside from the regulatory tariff provision, CEMIG's finances
are further strengthened by the State legislation which provides that
80% of the dividend declared to the State has to be re-invested in CEMIG
and 10% in ERMIG. According to certain quotas stipulated by law, a large
portion of the "aole" tax has to be returned to the State of origin for
productive purposes (Annex 14); Minas Gerais' Law, in turn, requires the
State government to invest its "sole" tax portion as share capital in
CEMIG. The State of Minas Gerais has agreed to keep in force its legislation
that requires dividend and sole tax investment in CEMIG and ERMIG.
6.21      Operating costs are projected on the basis of past experience,
taking into account CEMIG's future expansion. In order to be consistent
with the investment projections and because expense coverage is provided
for under the tariff regulatWons, ne provisions have been made for inflationary
increases. In 1971 CEMIG charged "amortization" which could be applied that
year for the last time; consistent with the new legislation, CEMIG will
charge "reversion" from 1972 onward, calculated at 3% of fixed assets in
operation (Annex 14).
6.22      CEMIG is subject to income tax, which under the prevailing
legislation amounts to 17% of the taxable income after allowing for various



- 21 -
deductible items. Income tax is also considered as an expense item in -Che
tariff applications. With the new tariff legislation starting in 1972, the
tax percentage will be lowered to 6% but can no longer be deducted as an
expense item in tariff applications.  The impact of this change on CEM I's
finances is marginal and does not adversely affect its financial position.
6.23      As indicated in the Forecast Sources and Applications of Funds
Statement (Annex 12) annual debt service coverage by internal sources is
expected to be around 1.6 during the period 1972-1977, increasing to 2.3
in 1980. During the period of construction of the Project, CEMIG's system
expansion would take place within the framework of the Government-approved
Regional Development Plan (paragraphs 2.12 and 3.12) which will be submitted
to the Bank for comment. Borrowings would be subject to the asset-coverage
test incorporated in Loan 566-BR, and after completion of the Project,
borrowings would also be subject to an objective test whereby maximum future
debt service would have to be covered not less than 1.5 times by historic
earnings.
Audit
6.24      The financial statements of CEMIG have been audited for a number
of years by the Brazilian branch of Arthur Andersen and Company. These
arrangements have been satisfactory. In order to ensure that adequate
auditing continues, a covenant similar to that included in previous loans,
requiring CEMIG to appoint auditors acceptable to the Bank, has been
repeated in the new loan.

VII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMIMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations the following agreements were reached:
(a)  The Federal Government will provide by the end of 1972 an
official development plan (South Central Region Generation
Development Plan) based on the efficient and coordi-
nated operation of the generating facilities in the South
Central Region, which the Bank will be given the opportunity
of commenting upon, and will use its influence to have non-
federal power agencies adhere to such programs in developing
their facilities (paragraph 2.12).
(b)  CEMIG will not undertake major programs of expansion of its
generation and transmission facilities without giving the
Bank evidence that such expansion is in accordance with
the Plan (paragraph 2.12) and that adequate financial
resources would be available (paragraph 3.12).
(c)  CEMIG will take all necessary action to have its electricity
tariffs set at levels which will produce revenues provided
for by the legislation of the Guarantor, and sufficient to
ensure CEMIG's continued operation in accordance with sound
financial and public utility practices. As permitted under
legislation, the tariffs should be based on assets revalued
at least once every calendar year (paragraph 2.16).
(d)  Any changes in the Guarantorts legislation, which in the
Bank's opinion would adversely affect the Borrowerts
financial position would be an event of default (paragraph
2.16).
(e)  ELETROBRAS will restore, and maintain a level of
participation in CEMIGts share capital of 16% (paragraph 3.02).
(f)  CEMIG will retain engineering consultants satisfactory to
the Bank and employ a contractor suitable to the Bank, on
torms and conditions acceptable to it for the civil works
of the hydroelectric plant (paragraph 4.04 and 4.07).
(g)  In the event there arises reason to believe CEMIG will not
have sufficient funds to assure the timely completion of the
Project, the Federal and State Governments will provide them
(paragraph 6.11).



- 23 -
(h) After the conpletion of the Project, CEMIG will not incur
debt without the Bank's concurrence, unless the maxim future
debt service is covered at least 1.5 times by historical
cash generation (paragraph 6.23).
7.02      The Project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$60
million, for a term of 30 years including a 7-year grace period.

ANNEX 8

SAO SIMAO HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
The Ecological Aspect
1.        An ecological reconnaissance of the Sao Simao hydroelectric project
was made in 1971. The conclusions are summarized below.
2.        The Project will form  a finger-lake reservoir, about 154 km in
length, with an area of about 675 sq km in a region classified as insalubrious
(see Maps 1 and 2). Vegetation in the water-spread area consists principally
of seasonal forest and there are no rare or endemic species. From the point
of view of natural vegetation, little of importance is likely to be lost.
The area is distinguished by a paucity of artifacts, and the lake is not
likely to destroy much of ethnological significance. Three small villages
(total population of 7,400), with nothing of architectual or historical
significance, will be inundated. The Project cost estimates make ample
provision for relocations, but a sociological expert should be associated
with the villagers' resettlement.
3.        The Sao Simao gorge on the Paranaiba River has an abundance of
fish, noted for their size and quality. As new fishing laws prevent commercial
fishing to a large extent, the main importance of the gorge is for sport
fishing, the only visitors to this remote site being sport fishermen from the
main inhabited areas of Brazil. The fish population is expected to be altered
by the lake, resulting in a decline in rushing-water species and an abundance
of still-water fish. A new and stringent law is in force in Brazil that
requires all hydroelectric companies to assist the Bureau for Development of
Fishing (SUDEPE) in making reservoir surveys to establish the best means of
promoting fish culture.  CEMIG will make every effort to comply fully with
these regulations so as to bring about a general increase in fish production.
4.        From the aesthetic point of view, care in routing the transmission
lines has been suggested so as not to spoil the natural beauty of the country-
side, particularly the Araxa area near Belo Horizonte.
5.        The main ecologkca  impact of the Project would be the loss of the
unique Sao Simao gorge and wa.terfalls situated some 16 km upstream of the
dam site, where the 1-km wWde ?aranaiba River is constr_cted by a narrow
basalt gorge. The gorge has aeep vertical walls and the river falls into
it longitudinally un both sidv.,. The gorge is not a tourist attraction nor
is it likely to become one  -i. ew of its inaccessibility and great distance
from population centers. The consultant ecologist has recommended that
although loss of the Sao Sima.) gorge is not likely to be seriously felt, its
features should nevertheless ,e preserved on film.

SAO SIKAO HYDROBLECTRIC PROJECT
Internal Economic Return
1.        The Project's internal economic return was determined as outlined
below, and approximates the discount rate at which the present worth of its
associated costs equals the present worth of the associated system benefits
that it produces over its lifetime.
a) The lifetime of the Project is assumed to be 40 years.
b) The capital cost of the Project is summarized in paragraph
4.09.  It includes all the costs of power generation and the
500 kV extra high voltage transmission line to Belo Horizonte.
To this has been added Cr$900.0 million out of CENIG trans-
mission distribution expansion cost of Cr$1,628 million (Annex 12)
during 1971-1980, which on a proportional basis represents
the added capital cost of distributing Sao Simao power to consumers.
Costs are net of all taxes and depreciation.
c) Associated system revenues plus applicable direct taxes on
electricity bills (paragraph 5.08) are used as a minimum value
of the associated economic benefits.
d) The annmal kilowatt hours were determined by apportioning
CEMIG's total estimated sales to the respective power stations
in accordance with their estimated operating conditions.
e) The tariff applied is 11.4 and 12.7 centavos per kWh for 1978
and 1979 and 1l.9 centavos thereafter, and has been calculated
on the basis of legislative provisions then in force. The
annual gross revenues from 1981 onward are Cr$737.8 million.
f) The gross operating expenses were determined as Cr$22.0 million
annually; they include, besides the cost of operation and
maintenance of the Sao Simao power station and the 500 kV
transmission lines to Belo Horizonte, a proportional allocation
for distribution operation.
2.        On the basis of the above, it was determined that the present worth
of associated costs would equal the present worth of the associated benefits
over a 40-year period at a discount rate_of 17g_._
3.        The Project's firm power potential of 760 MW at 100% load factor was
worked out on the basis of the river flow under most adverse dry conditions
and the initial plant installation of 1,000 MW. The Project's energy output
would be higher in years of normal rainfall and the economic return would
further improve.

Notes and Assumptions on Income Statements
1. Revenues from Sales of Power
According to Brazil's electric power tariff legislation, utilities
are permitted to charge tariffs producing revenues sufficient to cover all
operating expenses and to earn a return on remunerable assets (see Annex 1h)
of 10% to 12%. The revenue projections of the Income Statements 1971-1980
are therefore calculated in this manner.
2. Operation, Maintenance, Administration
The projections for the salaries and wages component included in
the operation, maintenance and administration costs assume an annual increase
of 7% which CEMIG considers to be sufficient to cover the cost of personnel
and wage increases. Prices for material have been assumed to increase 5% per
year over the forecast period. The cost of maintenance is based on CENIG's
general maintenance program.
3. Depreciation
A review of the useful lives of CEMIT's assets showed that the
average rate of depreciation amounts to about 2.8% per year. This is very
close to the 3% permitted by legislation, the rate which has been used in
the financial projections.

of 1934, subsequent amendments and decrees dated February 26, 1957,
              and November 4, 1964, and Laws 5,073 enacted on August 18, 1966, and
5,655 of May 20, 1971 (effective January 1, 1972).
2.        Prior to 1964, tariffs were based on the use of the historic
value of investment, consequently not reflecting the substantial inflation
which occurred in Brazil. The 1964 decree allowed utilities to revalue
their investment in order to reflect changes in price levels; the 1966
legislation made annual revaluation of assets mandatory.
3.        Under the existing regulations, tariffs are reviewed and approved
by the Department of Water and Power of the Ministry of Mines and Energy
every three years or at shorter intervals at the initiative of the utility
but with the approval of the Water and Power Department. Without advance
approval of that Department, between tariff revisions, the utilities may
add surcharges to current tariffs to cover compulsory increases in wages,
social benefits, costs of fuel and purchased power, and increases in
foreign debt service due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
4.        Tariff adjustments on account of revaluation of balance sheet
accounts are actually made by CEMIG as often as the Government calculates
and publishes economic correction factors (coefficients) showing the
variations in the price level. The coefficients are issued annually about
one month after the end of each year for the use of industry in general
as well as the electric utilities. The coefficients are applied by the
utilities to update the values of plant in service and work in progress,
depreciation and amortization or reversion reserves, if any, and certain
local currency loans of Eletrobras and the National Development Bank.
5.        Law 5,655 of May 20, 1971, introduces various changes in the
Brazilian tariff legislation which have an impact on the utilities'
finances, though not altering the legislation's basic philosophy. To
show which changes have been made, the following explanation on the matter
of electricity tariffs is given by comparing the situation before and
after January 1, 1972, the date the new law came into force:

assets in oper-
ation for amorti-
zation or up to 3%
on the same base for
reversion.
1/  Income Tax - During the period 1972-1975, income is taxed at a rate
of 6%. No special income deductions for income tax purposes are
allowed. Utilities are not permitted to include tax as an expense
in the tariff applications.
2/ Amortization or Reversion - Up to January 1, 1972, power utilities
had the choice of charging either ttamortization" (this has no con-
nection with debt amortization) of up to 5% of total fixed assets
in operation, or "reversion" of up to 3% on the same base. The
advantage of charging amortization was that the utilities could keep
the funds derived from such charges, whereas revenues from reversion
have to be paid to the Government and can only be borrowed back by
the power utilities.
Starting January 1, 1972, "amortization" was abolished and now
only reversion can be charged.  To strengthen ELETROBRAS' financial
influence in the Brazilian power sector, the company has been charged
with the responsibility of independently administering the reversion
fund on the Government's behalf. It pays the Government interest at
a rate of 3% for the fund, and lends money out of the fund to power
utilities at a rate of 10%. At ELETROBRAS' discretion, it can use up
to 5% of this fund to indemnify owners of land flooded by reservoirs.

The above-mentioned items normally are included in the power utilities'
tariff applications and, with the exception of reversion, provide the
funds for their operation and internal finances. Also, the consumers
pay for three additional charges, which the utilities collect and turn
over to the Government. These charges are as follows:
(i)  Emprestimo compulsorio-/      Collected from industrial and commercial
(compulsory loan)           consumers at a rate of 35% 6f the
electricity bill. Unchanged by the
new law.
1/ Remunerable Assets - The remunerable assets, on which the rate of
return under Brazilian legislation is calculated, consist of the
following:
Total fixed assets in operation at the end of the year
Add: Allowances for working capital
(i) Cash at the end of the year up to a maximum of the
depreciation reserve.
(ii) Inventories as approved by the tax authorities
(presently up to a maximum of 3% of gross fixed
assets in operation).
(iii) Receivables up to a maximum of two months' billing.
Deduct:
(i) Depreciation reserve at the end of the year.
(ii) Consumers' or other contributions.
(iii) Various small items specified by law.
2/ Emprestimo Compulsorio (Compulsory Loan) - Revenues from the compulsory
loan, for which customers receive 20-year obligations at 6% interest,
are administered by ELETROBRAS, which invests them in power utilities
either in the form of shares or loans at 13% interest. Half the amount
collected in a certain State has to be returned to that State, and the
remaining half is "re-distributed" among the other States. The com-
pulsory loan is scheduled to expire at the end of 1973.

1/ Imposto Unico (Sole Tax) - The sole tax is calculated on the basis
of the "fiscal rate for consumers," a countrywide average electricity
charge fixed every three months by the Department of Water and Power.
The funds are collected by the Government and are distributed as
follows:
EL3TROBRAS                    37%

The funds returned to the States are distributed among them as follows:
According to the State's area                        20%
According to the Statets population                  60%
According to the State's electric power
generation                                        2%
According to the State's electric power
consumption                                      15g

ANNEX 15
LAW OF SIMILARS
(Decree No. 61,574 of October 20, 1967)
1.        Decree No. 61,574 of October 20, 1967, introduced what is
commonly called in Brazil the "Law of Similars." It regulates the bid
price comparison of goods imported with goods manufactured locally, if
Brazilian industry is in a position to produce goods "similar" to those
imported. In this context it determines whether:
(i)  locally manufactured goods are exempt from local
taxation -- essentially the Industrialized Products
Tax (IPI) and the-Goods Circulation Tax (IPM).
These taxes together can reach a level of up to 40%.
(ii) imported goods are likewise duty and tax exempt.
2.        Exemption from taxes and duties as described above is granted
automatically if the following conditions apply:
(i)  Brazilian industry must be allowed to participate
in the bidding process with at least a 15% margin
of preference, computed on the CIF value (Brazilian
port) of "similar" imported goods.
(ii) Both local and foreign bids must be covered by
foreign financing at a term of not less than 15
years.
3.        If either one of these stipulations is not met, neither import
duty nor local tax exemption is granted unless a special arrangement can
be reached with representatives of the Brazilian industry and the Govern-
ment, who meet in a joint council. Experience shows that industry and
Government are reasonably flexible in agreeing to such arrangements.
