MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THIE PRESIIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA
FOR A NATIONAL LAND ADMIISTRATION PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recoimmendation on a proposed development credit to the Republic of Bolivia for SDR
13.7 million, the equivalent of US$20.4 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of
40 years to help finance a National Land Administration Project.
2.          Background. With 110 million ha and 6.6 million people, Bolivia is a
large and sparsely populated country. It is naturally divided into three major agro-
ecological zones: the Highland Plateau, the Andean Valleys, and the flat tropical
Lowlands. The former two correspond to the traditional agricultural areas. They have a
high population density relative to the available arable land and contain mostly small farms
using rudimentary technology. Climatic conditions are generally harsh, especially on the
Highland Plateau. Production consists of subsistence crops with some diversification in
the better endowed Valleys. By contrast, the Lowlands, regions of recent population
settlements, harbor a commercial agriculture in large to very large farms, next to a
minority of smaller traditional settlers. The Lowlands have a great potential for expansion
of agricultural land and boast one of the world's largest tropical forest areas.
3.          The Agrarian Reform Law, formulated following the Revolution of 1952,
has played an effective role in curtailing the feudal latifundio system on the Highland
Plateau and the Andean Valleys. Two institutions were set up to carry out the agrarian
reform process: the National Agrarian Reformn Commission (CNRA) and the National
Colonization Institute (INC). In recent years, however, both institutions have allocated in
a non-transparent way and virtually for free, enormous area of public land to individuals.
This has not only recreated a skewed pattern of land distribution, but provided also
incentives for significant land speculation and other distortions in the operation of rural
land markets. Moreover, the Agrarian Reform Law is not consistent with economic
reality, since it prohibits land rentals and restricts sales and subdivisions.
4.          The Bolivian land administration is in serious need of reform. Overlapping
jurisdiction between two main land titling agencies has created severe deficiencies in land
tenure administration and information, and has complicated and highly centralized titling
and registration procedures leading to very long delays in issuing titles. The main problem
with rural land titles, however, is not their absence, but their proliferation, their
inconsistency with current land occupancy, and erroneous recording in the Registry.
5.          This situation is most severe in the Lowlands, where tenure insecurity is
fueled by competing claims of various interest groups (e.g., logging industry, land holders,



- 2 -
small-and medium-scale farmers, indigenous groups, etc.) for the region's untapped
agriculture and forestry potential. Insecurity has depressed land values, caused a
reluctance to invest, encouraged environmentally unsound use of land and accelerated
expansion of the agricultural frontier in an inequitable and non-transparent manner. In the
traditional areas, where community organizations are strong, the situation is quite different
and the incidence of land conflicts much less. The cohesiveness of these organizations has
kept land holding within the community tightly controlled and limited to recognized
members. Yet, the communities have strong interest in securing property rights.
6.           In view of the problems with the land titling agencies, especially the illegal
allocations of very large land areas and other administrative irregularities, the Government
of Bolivia suspended their activities in late 1992. The Intervention Commission
(Comisi6n de Intervenci6n CNRA-INC - CI) was put in place to investigate their past
practices and to take charge of the current affairs. A moratorium on the allocation of
public land was declared for areas in excess of 50 ha per parcel.
7.           In March 1993, CI was confirmed as a transitional arrangement, pending
the creation of a new land administration agency. CI's mandate also includes to: (i) study
the territorial planning with respect to land use, the location, size and demarcation of the
land areas granted by the State; (ii) identify overlaps in agricultural, settlement and forest
zones, border conflicts, double titling and de-facto land possession; (iii) establish
irregularities and illegalities in the land acquisition in general; (iv) propose the laws and
regulations to rectify erroneous situations; (v) reorganize the offices of CNRA and INC;
(vi) provide statistics on land allocation and titling since the initiation of the agrarian
reform and INC's establishment, specifying its shortcomings; (vii) continue with the titling
of the ongoing land title requests; and (viii) identify, assess and reserve public lands for
distribution to small farmers. CI has started examining previous grants, and, where
necessary, has recommended the annulment of the titles. It is also reformulating
Government policy and institutional reform for the land sector.
8.           Project Objectives. The project objectives would be to achieve a more
efficient and transparent land administration system, clarify the land tenure situation,
identify public land suitable for small farmer settlements and promote a more sustainable
use of the country's land resources. To achieve these objectives the project would help the
Government to formulate land administration and policy reforms, obtain accurate land
ownership information, carry out land studies, alleviate land conflicts and improve land
transaction registration.
9.           Project Description. The project would have a major component
enhancing the land administration system within the current institutional framework and a
minor component implementing the legal and institutional land administration reforms, if
and when they are introduced. The Land Administration Enhancement component
(68 percent of project costs) would provide technical assistance and logistical support for
the formulation of new laws and regulations on land tenure policy and administration, the
implementation of a consensus building process on the proposed legal reforms, and land



-3-
policy advice for the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment (MDSMA).
This project component would also provide CI with technical assistance, equipment and
cadastral services to clarify and systematize the country's land tenure situation by:
identifying overlapping land titles on three million ha mostly situated in four Departments
(Santa Cruz, La Paz, Cochabamba and Chuquisaca), alleviating land conflicts, continuing
the land-titling process for small-holders, systematizing land tenure information, and
carrying out territorial planning. Moreover, it would help CI to identify, reserve, and
assess the suitability of 500,000 ha of public lands available for distribution to small-
holders. Finally, the component would provide technical assistance and training, and
finance civil works, equipment and incremental operating costs of four Departmental
Property Registry Offices (DDRR - Derechos Reales) to enhance their registration
capacity in the rural areas in which CI is operating. The Implementation of Legal and
Institutional Reforms component (32 percent of project costs) would include:
(i) strengthening of the National Land Institute to be established (INTI) by providing
technical assistance and financing operating costs; (ii) title regularization in rural areas
including, among other, the resolution of conflicts between landholders; (iii) provision of
land titles to about 10,000 spontaneous migrant families; and (iv) strengthening of the
Legal Cadastral Registry to be established (RLC) to support the operations of an
integrated legal and geographical land registry. Schedule A contains financing details.
10.         Implementation. The project would be carried out over a six-year period.
The project closing date would be December 31, 2001. Overall responsibility for project
planning and implementation would be vested in the Ministry of Sustainable Development
and Environment. CI and later INTI would be responsible for the day-to-day project
management, procurement and for the implementation of all project components, except:
(i) the land policy studies and Agrarian Courts sub-component under MDSMA; and
(ii) the Property Registry and RLC's institutional strengthening sub-components
implemented under the Supreme Court. CL/INTI and the Supreme Court would agree on
procurement and disbursement procedures for the Property Registry and RLC components
and meet at least twice per year to solve implementation problems. Retroactive financing
of SDR 1.34 million would be available for expenditures made after January 1, 1995 to
finance institutional strengthening and timely procurement of equipment and services.
11.         A Project Administration Unit under CI/INTI would be responsible for
managing a Special Account to be opened in the Central Bank. The implementing
agencies would maintain separate accounts for project expenditures. The agencies would
also hire independent auditors satisfactory to IDA. The cadastre survey and mapping
work would be contracted to the private sector under ICB procedures. Procurement and
disbursement arrangements are presented in Schedule B.
12.         Project Sustainability. The sustainability of the country's land institutions
and policy would be enhanced by the project providing support for a broad consultation
process leading to legal reform. In addition, the implementing agencies would be
integrated into a reformed civil service structure under which staff is expected to be better



- 4 -
motivated and managed. Finally, financial sustainability would be enhanced by introducing
cost recovery mechanisms which would guarantee long-term maintenance of land records.
13.          Lessons Learned. A recent review of Bank experience with land
administration projects indicates that in agrarian economies such as Bolivia, land rights
are an immensely political matter. When a program involves some redistribution of land
rights, political opposition is likely to be intense. Second, land titling efforts have to
commit considerable resources to institutional development to ensure sufficient technical
and human capacities for efficient reform implementation. Third, even with adequate
capacity, there is no quick-fix to land tenure problems. Improvements in this field can
only be achieved on a long-term basis. These lessons have been incorporated into the
project design, aiming at obtaining broad political approval for the reforms, strengthening
institutional capabilities, and addressing the pressing needs of the highest conflict areas.
14.          A review of experiences with land settlement programs identified a
number of important lessons. First, no settlement program can succeed without a clear
tenure policy. Second, the size of the holdings is an important factor in attracting settlers
and determining agricultural incomes. Outcomes are more successful if land allocations
are in line with educational levels, agricultural skills and experience, available family labor
and capital assets allowing proper land management. Third, there is massive evidence of
success in settlement schemes on good soils and in appropriate climates which shows the
importance of site selection and land use plans. Fourth, excessive paternalism on the part
of the administering agency should be avoided. The emergence of self-reliant groups
among settler communities is a vital ingredient in ensuring the sustainability of settlement
programs. Fifth, not all infrastructure and social services should be provided by the State
before settlers arrive. Safe water supplies should be present when settlers move in, and
roads should follow without much delay. The project design incorporates these lessons by
applying appropriate selection criteria for settlement areas and beneficiaries, studying basic
parcel sizes per region, organizing orientation workshops for settlers, providing settlers
with secure land titles, and coordinating assistance supplying basic infrastructure and
health services.
15.          Rationale for IDA Involvement. The project is fully consistent with three
of the broad objectives of the country assistance strategy presented to the Board on
February 8, 1994: strengthening of essential public institutions, alleviation of poverty, and
better management of the country's natural resources. The project would strengthen the
land administration institutions, improve land management and provide land to
landless peasants. Since 1992, IDA has maintained an intense policy dialogue on land
tenure and administration with the Government. It has supported the Government in the
suspension of CNRA and INC and in Cl's establishment as an interim solution.
IDA has assisted CI in its operations with technical assistance and training for policy
reform through several financing mechanisms. The proposed project would improve the
current land administration system thereby facilitating its transition to a permanent
integrated geographical and legal land administration system as envisaged by the
Government. The project would also prepare the land institutions for the



implementation of the legal reforms when introduced. Without the project, the transitional
land administration system is likely to collapse thereby jeopardizing the Government's
genuine intentions to legally and institutionally reform the system. IDA's unique role in
contributing to the solution of these politically sensitive land matters makes it the
Government's ideal partner to streamline land administration. IDA has also gained
substantial experience in land matters at the policy and operational level, and is, therefore,
uniquely placed to assist Bolivia with the complex set of reforms and investments which
the proposed project entails.
16.         Agreed Actions. During negotiations, assurances have been obtained
from the Government that: (i) if the moratorium on land distribution would be lifted and
the Government decides to distribute public lands other than for small agricultural and
livestock holdings as defined in the 1953 Agrarian Reform Law, it would distribute such
lands through sales in public auctions; (ii) during the title regularization process,
unproductive lands would be reverted to the public domain in accordance with the
Agrarian Reform Law; (iii) the Government would charge fees covering the direct costs of
cadastral surveys and titling services from medium and large holdings (and from the
Municipalities in which these landholdings are located); and (iv) the Government would
treat both genders equally in land allocation and stipulate women's land rights in the Land
Settlement Manual and publicity campaigns of Cat-San.
17.         Other agreements include: (i) the content of the Letter of Land Policy and
the timing of the legal reforms; (ii) the content of the Land Settlement Manual including
environmental safeguards; (iii) rules governing decisions on conflicting land claims and
their adoption by INTI; (iv) a list of priority cadastre areas for the first year of project
implementation; (v) project auditing and accounting arrangements; (vi) project monitoring
and supervision arrangements including the content of the Mid-Term Review;
(vii) preparation of a project implementation manual before July 31, 1995 and its prompt
adoption by CI; and (viii) project implementation in accordance with the implementation
plan including a detailed first year plan.
18.         Before effectiveness, the Government would provide IDA with: (i) the
signed Letter of Land Policy; and (ii) a signed agreement between MDSMA and the
Supreme Court on project management arrangements. Moreover, CI would adopt a Land
Settlement Manual including environmental screening procedures acceptable to IDA and
stipulating the Government's equal treatment of both genders in land allocation.
19.         Disbursement Conditions. Establishment of INTI as well as the adoption
by INTL of the internal procedures for the resolution of land conflicts and title
regularization cost recovery mechanisms would be conditions of disbursement of INTI
expenditures. Establishment of RLC and agreement between MDSMA and the Supreme
Court for the management of the RCL component would be conditions of disbursement of
RLC expenditures. Establishment of the Agrarian Court and institutional arrangements
between MDSMA and the Agrarian Courts would be conditions of disbursement for
expenditures related to training of the Agrarian Court staff.

20.         Environmental Aspects. The environmental impact of this project would
be strongly positive for the following reasons. First, early land tenure conflict resolution
would reduce incentives of title owners to deforest land to prove occupancy. Second,
private land under more secure individual property rights would be managed in a more
sustainable manner. Third, assistance to spontaneous migrants would reduce the negative
impact of such settlement on the environment. Negative impact reduction would be
achieved by: (i) selecting land with soils appropriate for agriculture; (ii) avoiding
settlements in areas which are ecologically protected, occupied by indigenous peoples,
inadequately represented in the National Protected Areas System, or within the buffer
zones of protected areas; and (iii) limiting the settlement land parcels to a size which is
sufficient to ensure the future of one family for one generation, maximizes the number of
families per available public land area and limits the deforested area as much as possible.
Fourth, land pressure in the Highland Plateau and national parks would be reduced by
giving priority migration assistance to people originating from those ecologically fragile
zones and willing to move to more appropriate areas.
21.         Participatory Approach. During project preparation extensive
consultation with stakeholders has taken place. The Credit would also finance several
public information campaigns and consensus building workshops with stakeholders.
22.         Program Objective Categories. The project relates primarily to public
sector management and natural resource management objectives and would alleviate
poverty by providing land to landless peasants.
23.         Project Benefits. In the long term, a more efficient and reliable land
administration and a legal framework more consistent with economic and social realities
would benefit all stakeholders in land matters. Main benefits would be an increased
knowledge of the land tenure situation leading to an improved capacity to administer
property rights and enforce land use regulations, more land security providing incentives
for the sustainable use of the country's land resources, and improved title registration
generating additional revenues for the judicial system and enabling a more effective land
tax collection by the municipalities. In addition, the proposed legal reforms, if
implemented, may reduce distortions in the allocation of the country's natural resources,
reduce the unequal distribution of land ownership among the country's population, and
alleviate poverty of the landless poor. Indigenous groups would also benefit from the
legal recognition of their rights over well-defined territories.
24.         In the short term, reform of the existing land administration would benefit
most the commercial farmers of the Lowlands, for whom more security of land tenure and,
when the land law is enacted, less rigidities in the land market would translate into higher
rates of investment and growth. This group would be the target of the project cost
recovery efforts. A second group which stands to benefit most from the project are land-
poor, spontaneous migrants in search of economic opportunities in the Lowlands. These
would be the beneficiaries of the land settlement programs. Also, the envisaged
legalization of renting land and sharecropping in the new Land Law would improve the



land security situation for tenants. At the same time such legalization is likely to increase
the supply of land available for rent or sharecropping arrangements, thereby further
increasing employment and improving the access of landless farmers to land.
25.          Project Risks. The project has three major risks. First, given the extreme
sensitivity of land matters in Bolivia, the timing and content of the proposed legislative
changes in support of the reform is largely unpredictable since they have to go through a
Congressional legislative process. There is a risk that Congress may not approve
legislation to establish INTI and RLC during the project period. However, the
Government is firmly committed to create INTI and RLC and submit the necessary
legislation which is likely to pass in Congress. About 70 percent of the project objectives
can be reached within the present institutional and legal framework. To mitigate the
project risks involved in legal reform delays, disbursement of funds for the land title
regularization and the introduction of a legal cadastral registry would depend on the
establishment of INTI and RLC, respectively.
26.          Second, land reversion and distribution of reverted land to small farmers
would be a very risky element of the project as it requires considerable political courage to
enforce reversion. This risk would be reduced by the project's support for national
consensus building measures from the initial draft of the laws through to their approval.
Such consensus would make it easier for INTI to implement reversion decisions made by
the Agrarian Courts. Moreover, the Mid-Term Review would focus on the
implementation of the land tenure policy as defined in the Government's Letter of Land
Policy and the Government's willingness and capabilities to resolve the land conflicts in
the agreed upon and transparent manner.
27.          Third, the implementing institutions have a weak management and
implementation capacity so that there could be substantial delays in project execution.
The project design intends to mitigate those risks by strengthening the implementing
agencies' management capacity, involving the private sector to carry out the cadastre
studies, and through intensive supervision and up-front procurement actions.
28.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
