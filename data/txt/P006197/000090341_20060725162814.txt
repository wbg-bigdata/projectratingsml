 3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

 3.1 Original Objective:
 The project objectives are to achieve a more efficient and transparent land administration system,
 clarify the land tenure situation, identify public land suitable for small farmer settlements and
 promote a more sustainable use of the country's land resources. To achieve these objectives the
 project helped the Government to formulate land administration and policy reforms, obtain
 accurate land ownership information, carry out land studies, alleviate land conflicts and improve
 land transaction registration.

 The project addressed inter-related problems of a poorly functioning system for land
 administration and the need to implement legal and institutional land administration reforms based
 on the Law 1715 of 1996. The project also sought to address deficiencies in the real property
 registration system and the strengthening of the Legal Cadastre for the graphic, geo-referenced
 record of property boundaries linked to ownership data.

 The project objectives were aligned with the priorities of the Government of Bolivia and the
 Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), as well as with the sector assistance strategy, all of
 which regarded as primary priorities poverty alleviation, public sector modernization and
 sustainable environmental and natural resource management. The project addressed some of the
 most complicated development challenges in Bolivia in areas where unclear land tenure situations
 had been the source of social tension.

 3.2 Revised Objective:
The project objective was appropriate and was not revised during the project implementation.

 3.3 Original Components:
The project included two components. These consisted of: 1) a major component improving the
land administration system, and 2) a minor component implementing the legal and institutional land
administration reforms. The major component of land administration improvement consisted of
activities relating to: i) Technical Assistance for the Formulation of a New Legal Framework and
Land Policy; ii) Land Management Improvement and Cadastre; iii) Identification of Land for
Settlement; and iv) Strengthening of the Property Registry. The minor component of
implementation of Legal and Institutional Reforms included activities related to: i) Strengthening
of the National Land Institute (later the National Institute of Agrarian Reform, INRA); ii) Title
Regularization; iii) Land Settlement Program (later dropped from the Supplemental Credit); and
iv) Strengthening of the Legal Cadastral Registry (RLC). In practice, the two components came to
be quite closely linked because the institutional reforms of the agencies and their operational
activities were inseparable. Furthermore the unification of title and cadastre in the land
regularization methodology and reforms to the land registry carried out under the project created a
single set of activities/institutional reforms for the Property Registry. For this reason, the project
expenditures relate more closely to the three main agencies' activities (i.e., INRA, Property
Registry,         Agrarian         Tribunal)       and       are       reported        as       such.

 3.4 Revised Components:
 A Supplemental Credit project was signed on October 17, 2001. In addition to adding financial
 resources to the original project components, the Supplemental Credit revised part of Component


                                                  - 2 -

2, dropping the activity described as "carrying out of a land settlement program to benefit about
10,000 migrant farmers, including, inter alia, the provision of land titles, and the orientation and
training of future colonists in basic agriculture and health in the tropical lowlands." The
Supplemental Credit replaced this with a new component, the "establishment of a reliable and
accessible national legal cadastre registry through: a) development and installation of a
computerized integrated system containing geo-references for registered titles; and b) increased
access to such legal cadastre registry in rural and urban areas by linking of the nine department
offices and thirteen regional offices of the Property Registry into an automated system." As noted,
the component of assistance to land settlement was revised at the moment of the agreement for
Supplemental Credit (October 17, 2001) and replaced by greater assistance for the creation of the
cadastre and its integration with the property registry.

table is provided. The table shows the two credit agreements along with their modifications,
which included two extensions of the closing date of the Supplemental Credit.

The performance of the original credit is rated as "moderately satisfactory and the Supplemental
Credit is rated as "satisfactory."

Although the project required more time to implement than was originally expected, the project
activities were successfully implemented and their outcomes were positive for the country.
However, government has expressed the opinion, and the Bank concurs, that the procedures were
slower and more expensive than expected and that it will be necessary in the future to speed the
land regularization process and make it more accountable through greater on-site monitoring.

In pursuit of its objectives the project assisted with the creation of a new agrarian reform institute,
the procedures for implementing the government's centerpiece agrarian reform law (Law 1715),
supported the automation of the property registry, supported the creation of a special agrarian
tribunal for land disputes, and assisted in the creation of the Agrarian Superintendence. It also
pioneered the registration of title in an automated database and the integration of cadastral and
registry records in an integrated system. It assisted in the creation of the procedures for land
regularization for private and communal lands and financed regularization of nearly three million
hectares of land.

4.2 Outputs by components:
Component of Land Administration Improvement:
The project component outputs by subcomponents provide indicators of the achievement of the
project objectives.

Component 1. Achievement of a more effective and transparent land administration system.
Concerning the first component, the achievement of a more effective and transparent land
administration system, the original credit and the Supplemental Credit performed satisfactorily.
This satisfactory performance is evidenced by the legal and procedural reforms enacted and their
enablement of the land regularization and land registration processes. The legislation and
regulations necessary for carrying out streamlined land regularization under the project were
enacted in 1996 and updated by means of Presidential Decree in 2003. These regulations and
procedures dealt with the fundamental provisions of property law and agrarian reform. Further
regulations also included the Manual for the Design of Human Settlements, the design of the
technical specifications for cadastral mapping required from third parties, INRA instructions on
inclusion of women in the titling process, and regulations for Internal Regularization (
saneamiento interno).

The National Agrarian Tribunal was established in November of 1999 as a special part of the
judicial branch of government for resolving land conflicts. By November of 2004, having finished
five full years of operation, it has opened 50 tribunals in the country's territory and resolved 1684
cases of agrarian land rights disputes.

The Superintendencia Agraria was also strengthened by PNAT activities, including a land market
study and a study of land use classifications in Bolivia, as well as organizational strengthening.
These outcomes reflect the expected performance and therefore the subcomponent is rated as
satisfactory.

Identification of public land suitable for distribution. Regarding the second sub-component, the
identification of public land suitable for distribution, the project's performance is rated as
moderately unsatisfactory. Although it is possible to argue that the objective was not realistically
scoped, because it was impossible to accurately predict the amount of public land suitable for
distribution which would be found ex ante in populated areas designated for regularization, the
component accomplished little identification of public lands for distribution. INRA has identified
about 30,000 hectares of land which is confirmed available for distribution. This is less than 10
percent of what was expected in project preparation. Furthermore the support for land settlement
was dropped from the project at the time of the establishment of the Supplemental Credit
agreement in October, 2001, which led to a de-prioritization of the identification of public lands.
The difficulty in identifying public lands for distribution suggests that very few such lands remain
in settled areas. Most public lands are actually virgin natural forests under protected area status or
concessions which makes them complicated for distribution for agricultural use. Innovative
schemes of community-managed forestry and agro-forestry would need to be developed to make
the distribution of public forest lands viable as an agrarian reform model.

Clarification of the land tenure situation. Regarding the third subcomponent, the clarification of
the land tenure situation, the project performed in a satisfactory manner, as evidenced by the
quantitative progress in land regularization in the project areas. The original credit was used to
regularize approximately 2 million hectares, primarily in the areas of San Julian, San Pedro in
Santa Cruz and Ixiamas, San Buenaventura in La Paz (see Table 1). The supplemental project
progress regularized a further 540,000 hectares in the province of Ichilo, Santa Cruz and in the
province of Pocona in Cochabamba. The Andean TCOs included for regularization in the
supplemental credit have been fully regularized except for the TCO Marka Camata in which there
is a conflict over one parcel. Thus the project succeeded in regularizing a total of approximately
2.9 million hectares out of an original goal of 3 million hectares. Taking into account the delays by
government in approving procedures during 1997 and 1998, and the political turmoil of
2002-2004, the overall achievement of the component is viewed as moderately satisfactory.

Component 2. Institutional development of the National Agrarian Reform Institute (INRA).
INRA was strengthened significantly in its ability to provide regularization services for the
country. It developed regulations, operating procedures and became increasingly adept in carrying
out land regularization on a broad scale. It broadened its scope of action in regularization to
include focused assistance to women to make them aware of their land rights and to provide them
with the supporting documentation required, such as civil identification cards. The development
of the automated information system (Sistema Informática de Saneamiento de Tierras--SIST) for
managing land regularization documentation and monitoring status was developed under the
project and introduced in nine departmental INRA offices and the central office. This system has
allowed INRA to operate more efficiently, to have greater transparency in its business and to
monitor its programs much more rapidly than before the project.

Improvement of the organization and management of four property registries. With respect to
Component 2, the improvement of the organization and management of the property Registries in
Santa Cruz, La Paz, Chuquisaca and Cochabamba, the project exceeded its original objectives.
The land registries in nine departmental capitals and three regional centers have completely
transferred the INRA data on boundaries and land rights holders to their records, have received



                                                        - 6 -

and installed the computerized system TEMIS, and have engaged in training for staff and are
carrying out transactions with the new system and migrating records into the system.
Furthermore, thirteen sub-regional offices installed the geo-referenced GEO-TEMIS system
which links registry and cadastral data. For this reason the PDO is rated as highly satisfactory.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The original Project Appraisal Document did not attempt to quantify a predicted net present value
or economic rate of return for the project. It set out a table of potential benefits which listed six
categories of benefit: better land prices and marketability of land, facilitation of land as collateral
for credit, increased planning horizon for on-farm investments, lowered land transaction costs,
prevention of encroachment on protected areas, and slowing of the deforestation process. During
the final year of the project an impact evaluation was carried out which addressed the first three of
these potential benefits. The impact evaluation was only able to make simple comparisons in the
economic indicators of properties/households regularized under the project and similar properties
not affected by the project and to collect qualitative indicators. The time between project activities
and the impact evaluation was very short, making it difficult for investment and marketability
indicators to manifest much change.

The first potential benefit area is the change in market value of land. The Superintendencia
Agraria indicates that land subject to regularization has a market value 70 percent higher than
land not subject to regularization. If generalizable across all areas of the country, this would
suggest a very high economic rate of return and a clear achievement of the land price benefits.
Other indicators also provide evidence that the expected potential benefits were achieved. The
impact evaluation records that 47 percent of the sample of smallholder beneficiaries responded
that they had perceived economic benefit up to the moment of evaluation, either through land
value increases, investments on the land made secure or through other means. Fourteen percent of
the sample indicated that the value of their land had increased, and 6 percent indicated that their
access to credit had improved. A total of 74 percent believed that the benefits have exceeded the
costs and 83 percent expected economic benefits to materialize in the future (these included
access to credit, increased land price, greater income from the land, and greater security).
Property investments between regularized and unregularized parcels in the smallholder group
showed little difference, although it appeared that regularized properties had about 56 percent
greater investment in farm machinery than unregularized properties. These indicators portray a
picture of positive, but limited economic impact up to the moment. However, it should be
emphasized that most of the properties in the sample have only been regularized for 1-3 years, and
in many cases do not have their final title. Especially in light of the high expectation of future
benefits, it appears likely that the lack of reported economic impact may be related to the short
time span elapsed between the regularization activity and the survey. Encroachment into protected
areas and rates of deforestation were not measured by the impact assessment. According to
government statistics, between 1990 and 2000, Bolivia lost an average of 270,400 hectares of
forest per year or an average annual deforestation rate of 0.43 percent. Between 2000 and 2005,
the rate of forest change increased to 0.45 percent per annum.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
The project was planned so that cost recovery and administrative fees would cover the main share
of recurrent costs to the government budget. The project did not achieve this level of cost



                                                 - 7 -

recovery. A total of $200,000 in fees were charged in Ixiamas and Caranavi for land
regularization and in San Julian, Pailon and Ichilo $239,500 in fees were charged. Total
government contribution was $6.74 million.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
As noted, major institutional development impacts were achieved under the project. INRA was
strengthened significantly in its ability to provide regularizations services for the country. It
developed regulations, operating procedures and became increasingly adept in carrying out land
regularization on a broad scale. It broadened its scope of action in regularization to include
focused assistance to women to make them aware of their land rights and to provide them with
the supporting documentation required, such as civil identification cards. The development of the
automated information system (Sistema Informática de Saneamiento de Tierras--SIST) for
managing land regularization documentation and monitoring status was developed under the
project and introduced in nine departmental INRA offices and the central office. This system has
allowed INRA to operate more efficiently, to have greater transparency in its business and to
monitor its programs much more rapidly than before the project.

In the area of property registration the development and installation of TEMIS information system
under the project has permitted the Real Property Registry to automatically incorporate new
property information provided by INRA, to link graphic and textual data on each property, handle
transactions automatically and to perform title searches or other data retrieval with greatly
improved efficiency. The system was installed in nine departmental offices, thirteen regional
offices and one office in El Alto, together covering most of the demand for real property
registration services in the country.

In a similar way, the project's support for the Agrarian Tribunals (Tribunal Agrario) has extended
the reach of this institution into all regions of the country. The component strengthened the
tribunals by assisting with their formation, equipped them with furniture and office machinery for
41 offices, promoted a training system for judges and other professionals in the system directed
toward conflict resolution and agrarian law, and created a automatic system for case management.
These strengthening inputs resulted in the current functionality of 41 tribunals in nine
departmental capitals, and 32 in provinces, each one operating with a judge, secretary and
recorder of acts.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Two different types of factors out of the control of government impacted the project. With
respect to public lands, the project could only identify public lands which field teams encountered
during land regularization surveys. Thus no more public land for distribution could be identified
than that which was found by the teams. Political chaos marked by widespread closure of major
roads during 2003, 2004 and 2005 negatively affected the pace of the project by preventing
contractors and project personnel from reaching field sites on numerous occasions. However,
each of these blockages was temporary, and did not disrupt operations permanently in any case.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The project's implementation in the latter part of 1997 and 1998 was stalled when government


                                                     - 8 -

commitment to the project and INRA temporarily faltered. In July 1998 the acting director of
INRA resigned amid controversy about the correct application of the Law 1715. INRA remained
one month without a Director, paralyzing decision-making and payments. In June of 1998 the
Ministry of Finance (Public Investment) informed INRA that it could no longer finance salaries
from the IDA Credit. The Ministry of Finance further indicated that it did not have funds to
finance the counterpart contribution to INRA. These problems provoked an exodus of qualified
staff from the Institute. By late1999 these problems had been largely solved and the project was
back on track, with strong governmental support. A further complication was the fact that the
involvement of the President's office in signing titles created an enormous backlog of unsigned
titles which continued for the life of the project.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
As the executing agency, INRA demonstrated over time a great commitment to accomplishing the
goals of land regularization, which is born out by the achievement of the land regularization
objectives. The pace of execution of the project was slower than expected, largely due to the
implementation regulations requiring a longer time-frame than planned and on contracting issues
which required substantial amounts of time to negotiate and carry out.

5.4 Costs and financing:
The following set of four tables summarizes the overall project costs in dollars. It divides the
credit and counterpart expenditures across the three major institutional actors involved (INRA,
Property Registry and Agrarian Tribunal). The final table is the overall total.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The overall sustainability of the project's achievements is rated as likely for the reasons described
below. From the outset the project was seen as a long-term contribution to establishing a strong
legal, informational and institutional basis for land tenure in Bolivia. A number of other donors
including IDB, DANIDA, and the Netherlands have joined to support the effort. The current
government, civil society and social movements, as well as the commercial agricultural sector
remain strongly supportive of the overall effort, although the current government and
representatives of civil society are critical of the perceived slowness of the land regularization
activity and the small quantities of land identified for redistribution. Government seems certain to
extend the lifetime of Law 1715 for another five years to complete the land regularization process
country-wide.

Government commitment:
Government commitment to the goals of the project remains strong, although government has
expressed frustration with the slowness and perceived lack of accountability of the processes of
land regularization in certain cases. Government has signaled that it intends to finish the remaining
areas of the country which have not yet been subject to regularization on an accelerated basis and
to continue the strengthening of the registry and cadastre with the goal of transferring the
cadastral databases to municipalities where they will be used for multiple purposes including land
use planning, local infrastructure planning and maintenance, and property taxation. Government
has also signaled a strong commitment to finishing the regularization of the outstanding
indigenous land claims, based on the methods developed under the project.

Strengthened INRA and Property Registry:
The investment made under the project in INRA and the Property Registry has significantly
enhanced the institutional capacity of each. INRA's financial management systems are now
regarded as completely functional, its regional offices are fully staffed and its central departments
are viewed as capable by other government agencies. There is some perception, particularly by
civil society, that INRA's field operations and technical-juridical evaluations lack credibility,
particularly in the Department of Santa Cruz. Government is pledging to reduce outsourcing and
increase transparency through public monitoring of its processes to deal with these issues. The
capacity of INRA to address policy issues has been strengthened, but is still not sufficient to
address all of the challenges it faces, such as a functional policy on land distribution, and its
strategy for finalizing land regularization and processing highland indigenous land claims. The
Property Registry has increased its ability to handle transactions and has reduced title search time
significantly through automation. The completeness and accuracy of its records has been
increased dramatically. However, it must be noted that neither land regularization nor land
registration are currently self-supporting through fees and financial plans for future activity rely
heavily on continued support from multi-lateral and bi-lateral donors.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The land regularization process is still incomplete in Bolivia. About 15 percent of the overall land
area of the country has been completed, and a further 31 percent is in process. Many important



                                                  - 11 -

agricultural areas, forest areas and lands claimed by indigenous groups remain to be regularized.
The new government estimates that five more years of work will be necessary to complete the
task. This estimate appears reasonable. Formal land markets are functioning in parts of Bolivia,
but there is an active informal land market which over time will tend to undermine the
accomplishments of the project if unchecked. Protected areas are still subject to encroachment by
a variety of actors including loggers, large scale agricultural operations and small-scale farmers.
The land distribution element of the Law 1715 is widely considered to have fallen short of its
goals and social demands for productive land remain strong, particularly in the eastern part of the
country. In the highlands, most indigenous land claims are unmet. Therefore, it is expected that
government will need to devote considerable attention over the next 5-10 years to these issues
before routine operations of land use, land markets and land administration will be the norm.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The overall Bank performance in identification, preparation assistance and appraisal has been
rated satisfactory. The project was consistent with the GOB and Bank development priorities and
strategies, as well as Bank's CAS. The Bank's inputs in terms of staff and skill-mix were
considered as adequate during the preparation and implementation of the project. The project
pioneered the implementation of a new legal framework for land rights in Bolivia and as such the
Bank team was obliged to make various adjustments during implementation, including dropping
the land settlement subcomponent in agreement with government. The lack of a baseline
evaluation datum made impact evaluation difficult, particularly to measure economic and financial
impacts. The long lifespan of the project also meant that management responsibility was shared
across three task managers which complicated the transmission of lessons learned over the course
of implementation. The Bank demonstrated a high degree of flexibility in carrying out four
amendments to the original credit agreement, arranging a Supplemental Credit and administering
two additional amendments of the Supplemental Credit, including two extensions.

7.2 Supervision:
Overall Bank supervision is rated satisfactory. Semi-annual progress reports exhibit a clear
quantitative assessment and detailed qualitative analysis of project performance over the life of the
project. However, some ambiguity is displayed in the progress reporting with respect to the
changing of performance indicators after the supplement credit was signed. It was not always
clear that progress reporting after the signing of the supplemental credit referred only to the
progress of the supplemental credit. Supervision missions were composed of an appropriate mix
of international and local professionals. The core supervision team changed over the life of the
project but always incorporated some members from previous teams into the new ones. A total of
19 supervision missions were carried out.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The project preparation by the borrower was rated satisfactory. The borrower committed



                                               - 12 -

adequate resources to the preparation efforts. A national preparation team composed of many
professions in the areas of land administration and land law, and natural resource management
was assembled by the government and a major effort was mounted to design and promulgate the
Law 1715 which the project implemented.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
The performance of the GOB is rated satisfactory. With the exception of the period noted above
in 1998, GOB committed full resources to the project, and consistently took actions to improve
performance of the project, albeit at a slower pace than was foreseen in the design. Uncertainty in
executive decisions about INRA caused by the political upheavals of 2003-2005 created some
delays in moving ahead with institutional and staffing reforms which also contributed to the
project being implemented more slowly than originally expected.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
The chief implementing agency INRA, is rated as performing moderately satisfactorily. The Bank
reiterated concerns about institutional weakness in INRA consistently over the course of the
project and planned reorganizations were only partially fulfilled. Key regional directorships were
unfilled for substantial periods during project implementation and concern was expressed by the
Bank at different points about the transparency of the selection processes for the regional
directorships. Actions to improve management systems within INRA were partially completed.
Nevertheless, INRA made great strides in improving the procedures for land regularization, for
introducing streamlined procedures applicable in some cases, in improving its supervision of
contractors, in making public information available to beneficiaries and in emphasizing women's
property rights in its procedures, particularly during the final three years of implementation. While
the Bank expressed concern about the lateness of audit reports, these were all satisfactory.
Procurement and disbursement procedures were strictly complied with throughout the life of the
project.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance was rated moderately satisfactory in the execution of the original
credit and satisfactory in the Supplemental Credit.

8. Lessons Learned

Land regularization is necessary but not sufficient for land distribution.
A major lesson of the project is the land regularization process in Bolivia has not led to any
significant progress on land distribution, which was one of the chief motivations of the Law 1715
and certainly an expectation of the social movements which advocated for the law. The nearly 10
years of progress in land regularization show that while regularizing land tenure status is clearly a
necessary precondition for land distribution, it is not sufficient. This lesson suggests that there is a
need for a more directly proactive land policy on distribution which is less driven by the process
of land regularization, but rather by specific objectives, and which seeks the policy tools necessary
to meet those objectives.

Overall framework for prioritizing and targeting is needed;
Although about 46 percent of Bolivia's total land area is either regularized or in process, the
perception that regularization has not been effective persists. This appears to be a result of the



                                                 - 13 -

lack of an adequate framework for prioritizing and targeting the land regularization process. This
issue was flagged on repeated supervision missions, and a plan was created, but operationalization
of the plan has not yet occurred. Although impact evaluation data is not of sufficient quality to
make precise judgments, the perception of current policy-makers is that many important areas
have been ignored. Furthermore the continuing frequency of (often violent) land conflicts in the
eastern lowlands suggests that areas of high social concern have been by-passed. It seems clear
that to make the most out of further exercises in land regularization, a more clear framework for
prioritizing and targeting areas is necessary.

Andean indigenous communities represent very different issues and require a modified
strategy;
The project encountered a very different set of issues in the highland indigenous areas than were
found in lowlands, including disagreements among communities and territorial claims. Progress in
their regularization was very slow for these reasons. The project synthesized a number of
procedural lessons learned during it course. In some cases--such as the desire by certain highland
landholders to maintain individual ownership--it is clear that the resolution of these issues can
only be through higher-level political decisions. In other cases, procedural refinements specifically
for Andean TCO's are called for, particularly in establishing consensus for formation of the TCO.
The main lesson learned is that issues of territorial administration must be resolved prior to
establishing property rights in highland areas.

Maximize local ownership of process and community participation for results;
As the project matured, it became increasingly clear that local ownership of the process and
community participation facilitated the field work, improved the quality of information and
improved the involvement of women in the process. Multiple consultations, involvement of social
organizations in the contacting of property holders, well-publicized displays and provision of
materials to communities all contributed to satisfaction and improved efficiency, particularly in the
use of "internal regularization" (saneamiento interno) as a tool to permit communities to provide
INRA teams with most of their property rights information at the moment of field work.

Build in research/policy analysis, piloting and evaluation schemes ahead of full-scale
implementation;
The project accomplished a great deal of learning through its large-scale contracts (for field work,
technology). But the project did relatively little policy analysis and research to compare
methodologies, prioritize areas, pilot innovations or evaluate itself. For these reasons institutional
learning processes were slow.
