REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF PERU FOR AN
IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Peru for the equivalent of US$25.0 million to help finance
an Irrigation Rehabilitation project. The loan would have a term of 17 years,
including three and a half years of grace, with interest at 8.5 percent per
annum. The Kingdom of the Netherlands will contribute the equivalent of $1.0
million to the financing of the project, under a technical assistance agree-
ment with the Republic of Peru.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Peru" (No.
655-PE) was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 3, 1975. A
basic economic report on Peru is now under preparation. The following dis-
cussion, as well as the country data sheets attached as Annex I, reflect
the findings of recent missions to Peru.
3.        Since the military came to power in 1968 the Government has followed
a development strategy aimed at linking economic growth to a transformation
of society to achieve broader popular participation in the country's economic,
social and political life, thus addressing one of the most serious problems
of Peru's economy and society--the sharp differences in wealth and opportuni-
ties between income classes and geographical regions. A new government
headed by General Morales Bermudez, which took office in August 1975, has
been reassessing the progress made since 1968 in the onerous task of recon-
ciling growth, financial stability and better income distribution. The main
problems were a contraction in domestic savings, particularly in the public
sector, a fall in efficiency in the productive sectors and a retrenchment in
private sector investment. Subsequently the Government made important modi-
fications in policies that would leave the basic long-term objectives un-
changed, but would call for a more gradual approach to reforms of the economic
and social system with an emphasis on measures that increase domestic savings,
encourage private sector investment and improve efficiency in production.
4.        Between 1970 and 1974 output was growing at an average annual rate
at 7%, but this was accompanied by growing financial instability. In 1975
the growth rate dropped to less than 3% and it became clear that sustained
high growth rates were dependent upon improvements in both internal and ex-
ternal financial policies. Gross domestic investment rose from 13% to almost
19% of GDP between 1970 and 1975, largely because of the increase of public
and private investment in mining and petroleum. However, as consumption
also grew faster than GDP and heavy losses were incurred by public enterprises
marketing imported petroleum and foodstuffs, gross national savings fell to
less than 8% of GNP.  The excessive growth of aggregate demand combined with
the sharp rise in Peru's import prices since 1973 resulted in an acceleration

-2-
of inflation--from an average annual rate of 7.2% during 1969-73 to over
24% in 1975--and an increase in the deficit of the balance of payments on
current account from 0.5 to 11% of GDP between 1972 and 1975. Net long-
term capital inflows rose from US$110 million in 1972 to US$840 million in
1974 and allowed a US$275 million increase in net international reserves in
spite of the widened resource gap. In 1975, although net long-term capital
inflows totalled an estimated US$1.2 billion, they were not sufficient to
finance the current account deficit and net international reserves fell from
US$680 million in December 1974 to around US$127 million in December 1975.
5.        During 1975 the Government approved a series of tax and price
measures to reduce the excessive growth of aggregate demand and to stimulate
the growth of food output and exports but these were insufficient to reverse
the deteriorating financial trends during that year. Additional measures
were taken in January 1976, including increases in taxes and official prices
and cuts in public expenditures, but Peru's financial position continued to
worsen during the first half of the year, with the public sector deficit
still growing. The Central Government deficit was caused by a combination
of rapid growth of both current and capital expenditures resulting from
inflation and very low growth of current revenues. The latter was due
mainly to the sharp fall in income tax payments by the mining sector
(reflecting trends in world copper prices) and to declining imports subject
to duty. Although the income of many public enterprises rose substantially
because of price measures taken in January 1976, the combined deficit of
all state enterprises remained large for several reasons. These included
the operating losses of the steel and fishing companies, the low surpluses
of the mining companies and large cost overruns on investment projects,
mainly in the petroleum sector.
6.        Since the large credit expansion that was required to finance the
public sector deficit was not compensated by a reduction in the rate of in-
crease of credit to the private sector, net domestic assets of the banking
system expanded vigorously during the first semester of 1976, at a time
when liabilities to the private sector had practically stopped growing in
nominal terms. The resulting expansion fueled both inflation and import
demand. At the same time, a decline in international prices for Peruvian
exports kept export earnings depressed and the general uncertainty on the
economic outlook caused large short-term capital outflows. The overall
result was that net international reserves fell by over US$525 million
during January-May to a negative level of around US$400 million; the
foreign currency holdings were then almost exhausted in spite of US$212
million of IMF assistance which included the first credit tranche and the
use of the compensatory and oil facilities.



- 3 -
7.        During May and June of 1976, a comprehensive package of drastic
measures was approved to cut down the growth of aggregate demand, restore
balance of payments equilibrium and reduce inflation. The measures included:
(a) a sharp increase in taxes on exports, petroleum products, sales, ciga-
rettes and automobiles; (b) an increase of 3-4 points in average interest
rates; (c) a cut in public expenditures; (d) the freezing of all wages
until the end of 1976 after an adjustment of around 10-15% to ease the
impact of the other measures on the cost of living; (e) a tight monetary
program, involving a sharp contraction in the rate of expansion of credit
to both the public and private sectors; and (f) a devaluation of the Sol
from S/.45 to S/.65 per US dollar.  From mid-September onward Peru adopted
a policy of frequent adjustments in the exchange rate roughly in line with
relative price increases.  By March  9, 1977 the dollar parity had reached
S/.73.12. As a complement of the stabilization package the Government obtained
US$330 million of balance of payments support loans from North American and
European commercial banks in early December. An additional loan of US$32
million from Japanese commercial banks was signed in early March 1977.
8.        Preliminary data for 1976 suggest that the tough stabilization
program has been moderately successful in turning around Peru's financial
trends. Between 1975 and the second semester of 1976, public sector savings
rose from minus 1.0% to a positive 1.1% of GDP, and the overall deficit at
the public sector was cut from 10.4 to 7.7% of GDP. The improvement was
mainly a result of a large fall in the overall deficit of public enterprises
from 6.2 to 0.3% of GDP between 1975 and the second semester of 1976, owing
mainly to the price adjustments introduced during 1976. The public sector
financial performance could have been even better, had it not been for a
disappointing performance of tax revenues. The measures taken during 1976
in respect to some taxes were not enough to offset the contractions in yields
from other taxes and Central Government current revenues fell from 16 to
14.4/% of GDP between 1975 and the second semester of 1976.
9.        The improvements in overall public sector finances, the tight credit
policy, a strict adherence to wage guidelines set in June and the frequent
devaluations led to a reduction in the volume of merchandise imports by 14%
and a drop in the inflation rate during the last months of the year. While
between December 1975 and December 1976 prices rose by over 44%o, their monthly
growth rate declined to around 1%S in November and December.  The cut in im-
ports and a 16% increase in export volume narrowed the balance of payments
current account deficit from 11.5% of GDP in 1975 to an estimated 7.5% in
1976 and 6.5% in the second semester. Net international reserves rose by US
$15 million during the second semester of 1976.
10.       The growth of GDP remained sluggish in 1976 (below 3%).  The sectors
most affected by the restrictions were manufacturing, construction and services.
Mining, fisheries and agriculture, on the other hand, showed very significant



-14 -
improvements.  Mining output grew by almost 9% mainly as a result of fewer
labor stoppages and the start-up of the Cuajone mine. Fisheries output
rose 26% because of the recovery in anchovy catch. After several years of
stagnation, agricultural output is estimated to have grown as fast as
population; perhaps most significant, a large part of the better performance
of the sector came from a sharp rise in production of food crops for the
domestic market (mainly maize) resulting partly from more adequate price
policies. Finally, during 1976 much progress was made in completing the
oil pipeline from the Amazon region to the Coast, which will be in operation
during 1977; with present proven reserves, it is expected that Peru's net
petroleum imports will fall from over $240 million in 1976 to less than $20
million by 1980.
11.       Besides moving  forcefully towards financial stabilization, the
Government has been approving a series of important measures with far reaching
long-term development consequences. The drive towards eliminating the dis-
tortions in relative prices has made considerable progress; price controls
are being gradually relaxed. The more flexible exchange rate policies mark
a major break with the past and will not only facilitate balance of payments
management but promote more efficiency in domestic production. The Government
is also pursuing a more flexible interest rate policy to eventually bring
the rates to positive levels in real terms.
12.       Priority is now given to increasing efficiency in the productive
system and real efforts to restore confidence and dynamism in the private
sector are being made. The Government has declared that the State will
divest itself of some of the nationalized enterprises. The first measure,
taken last July, was to return the fishmeal fishing fleet to the private
sector. Participation of the private sector in petroleum exploration and
medium-scale mining development is also now being encouraged. In the agri-
cultural sector a new program to support medium and small farmers (owning
between 3 and 100 hectares) is being launched and more attention is given to
the management and labor problems in the cooperatives. Moreover, further
efforts to prepare rural development projects benefitting the poorer groups
and to provide more infrastructure in rural areas are being made. Finally,
the pruning of the public investment program to a more manageable size is
under way and a reorganization of the public administration has been announced.
13.       Total public sector external debt (outstanding and disbursed)
tripled between 1970 and 1975--from US$0.9 billion to US$2.67 billion--and
average terms deteriorated markedly. Average maturities of new commitments
fell from 10.7 years in 1971 to 5.6 years in 1975 as a result both of heavy
borrowing for non-project purposes from commercial banks and the low level
of lending from official sources. Between 1970-72 and 1975 the share of
net disbursements coming from commercial banks rose from less than 30 to 50%.
During 1976 important changes in the source of commitments took place.
Although foreign commercial banks remained the main source of external loans,
their share in total 1976 commitments fell from 61 to 51%j because of a
sharp increase (to 36%) in the share of commitments coming from international
agencies and suppliers. This lengthened the average maturity of 1976 commit-



-5-
ments to the 1971 level. The public debt service ratio rose to an estimated
23% in 1975 reflecting both a sharp increase in interest payments and the
decline in the value of merchandise exports. During 1976 the public debt
service ratio rose again to 24.7% in spite of the recovery in exports, because
of sharply increased interest payments. This level of debt service places
a heavy burden on the balance of payments but the Government has committed
itself to give first priority in foreign exchange allocation to debt service
payments.
14.       Improvements in the balance of payments in the future will depend
on:(a) continued efforts to increase savings and contain import growth; (b)
maintaining a low dependence on imported petroleum, permitted by the comple-
tion of the oil pipeline, through additional petroleum exploration; and (c)
increasing export volume with the timely completion of mining projects now
under way and the expansion of nontraditional exports. The current account
deficit would then fall to negligible levels by 1980. However, gross capital
requirements would still have to average around $1.1 billion yearly during
1977-80 to allow for some recovery of net international reserves. This is
substantially less in real terms than what was required in 1975-76. The
public debt service ratio is projected to rise to 28-29% in 1979 but decline
in the 1980s if the projected reduction of the current account deficit is
achieved and if dependence on foreign commercial borrowing continues to be
drastically reduced from the high 1973-75 levels. However, to complement
the Government efforts to attain the latter condition and improve the external
debt profile, lending from governments and international agencies should not
be limited to the foreign exchange component of projects suitable for external
financing and will have to include some local currency financing.
15.       In the light of the strong measures taken during the past year
there are grounds for optimism about continued improvement in economic per-
formance. On the assumption that the Government will continue its financial
stabilization policies and make further progress in laying the basis for
rapid and more balanced development, Peru remains creditworthy for Bank lending.
The Bank, both as a lender and as chairman of the Consultative Group, will
continue to monitor developments closely.
PART II - BANK OPERATIONS IN PERU
Bank Operations
16.       The Bank has made 32 loans in Peru for a total amount of US$527.3
million, net of cancellations; of these, 23 loans, totalling US$213.2 mil-
lion were fully disbursed as of February 28, 1977. About 42% of Bank lend-
ing to Peru has been for transportation (mainly highways and ports), 20%
for electric power, 15% for agriculture, 15% for mining and industry, and
about 8% for an education project and a sites and services project. Pro-
ject execution has been generally satisfactory. Annex II contains a state-
ment of Bank loans as of February 28, 1977, and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.



-6-
IFC Operations
17.       IFC commitments to date have been about US$24.o million (US$15
million to Southern Peru Copper Corporation for the Cuajone Copper Mining
Project and the rest all in industry) of which US$15.3 million is held by
the Corporation. A summary statement of IFC investments as of February
28, 1977 is presented in Annex II.
Bank Strategy
18.       The main objectives of Bank lending to Peru have been to aid in
(a) the creation of a physical and social infrastructure capable of sus-
taining and fostering the evolution of the nation's productive capacity;
(b) the expansion of productive capacity in crucial sectors; and (c) the
consolidation of structural and institutional changes now under way, par-
ticularly land and educational reforms. In the past Bank lending has been
concentrated on infrastructure in the transportation and power sectors;
the most recent loans in these fields were made for the Transandean Corridor
Project in May 1976 and for a power project in the Lima area in September
1976. Our emphasis is now shifting to the more directly productive fields--
mining, agriculture and industry--to aid Peru in reducing her current bal-
ance of payments problem and to strengthen institutions carrying out Peru's
economic and social reforms. The FY76 US$40 million mining loan, for
instance, was designed mainly to expand production for export and to
strengthen the effectiveness of the public mining enterprise, CENTROMIN,
particularly in project planning and execution. The Industrial Credit
Loan of January 1977 is designed to expand production for export and sub-
stitute economically for imports while improving the project evaluation
capability of Peru's national development bank, COFIDE. Future Bank lend-
ing would give priority to agriculture to help increase food production,
raise the standard of living of the rural population and to strengthen
the relatively weak ministries and agencies operating in this field. In
addition to the proposed irrigation rehabilitation project a second irriga-
tion rehabilitation loan is currently being prepared with the assistance
of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program and an agricultural credit project has
been appraised and will be negotiated later this year. Bank staff and the
FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program are also assisting the Government in the
preparation of projects for rural development in the mountain region. Pre-
paratory work is proceeding on other projects in the water supply and trans-
port sectors. The Bank also expects to continue to play a role in coordi-
nating external assistance and in being a catalyst for new sources of funds
for major investment projects through the Consultative Group.
19.       Bank loans to Peru constituted about 6.0% of total outstanding
debt, including undisbursed, at the end of 1975, and absorbed 4.0% of the
country's external debt service obligations in 1975. With the Bank now
increasingly active in Peru, our share in the country's total outstanding
debt is expected to increase but not to exceed 9% by the end of 1980.

PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
20.       Although contributing only 15% to Peru's GDP, agriculture employs
more than 40% of the labor force. In addition, agro-based industries account
for around 30% of employment and 40% of value added in manufacturing. Agri-
cultural output, and especially food production, has lagged behind population
growth (3.2%) for at least the past 15 years. The resulting growth of food
imports has placed increasing pressures on the balance of payments and Govern-
ment subsidies have been a serious drain on the public sector budget and
national savings. Raising the sector's poor performance thus has become in-
creasingly critical for future economic progress and to provide employment
for the rapidly increasing rural population.
,-
The Resource Base
21.       The country's three major regions are:
(a) the narrow Coastal Zone along the western edge of the country
which encompasses only about one-fourth of the arable land but produces
around two-thirds of the value of agricultural output. Rainfall is near
zero and virtually all cultivated land is irrigated. This region is highly
productive and commercialized, offers good conditions for a variety of crops
and livestock, and is close to the major urban markets. Prior to the land
reform, summarized below, coastal agriculture consisted of large privately-
owned plantations producing Peru's major export crops, sugar and cotton, as
well as of large rice estates and small truck farms. Rapid mechanization
in the 1960s resulted in increasingly serious problems of labor displacement
and urban migration. The plantations and large estates have since been con-
verted to worker-owned cooperatives.
(b) the Sierra, or highlands region, which is characterized by low-
productivity small land holdings and subsistence agriculture. Climate, soils,
and water availability are poor and the man-land ratio is extremely high.
Commercialization is inhibited by high transport costs to major markets and
opportunities for non-farm employment are limited. Cereals, tubers, and
livestock are the major products. Most of Peru's rural population subsists
in the Sierra, often under the most precarious conditions, although increas-
-ing numbers have left the Sierra in recent decades to crowd into the urban
slums of the coast.
(c) the Selva or jungle region which covers two-thirds of Peru but
currently accounts for less than 10% of total population. The region is be-
coming increasingly important economically because of oil discoveries. Two
Transandean Highway projects, ore financed by the Bank and the other under
consideration by the Inter-American Development Bank, are expected to con-
tribute further to the region's development. Nevertheless, because of the
difficulties of transport and frequently unfavorable soil and climatic con-
ditions, the jungle offers only limited potential for agriculture with
presently known technology.



-8-
Agrarian Reform
22.       Agrarian reform in Peru, one of the most ambitious efforts of its
type ever undertaken in Latin America, has dominated the agricultural scene
since the Military Government came to power in October 1968. Since that
date the previous modest process of expropriating some large holdings for
allocation to individual smallholders has been replaced by a massive program
of transferring much broader categories of holdings in the Coast and Sierra
(but not the Selva) into worker-owned production cooperatives and other associ-
ative units.  In the process the hacienda system has been virtually eliminated.
By the end of October 1975, 7.3 million ha had already been expropriated, of
which 6.1 million ha had been adjudicated and assigned to 251,000 families.
By the end of 1976, about 10 million ha were scheduled to have been distributed
to an estimated 400,000 peasant families, or roughly one-third of the rural
population.
23.       The institutional structure of Peruvian agriculture has been dramat-
ically changed by the agrarian reform program. The results achieved in terms
of production, employment and income distribution have thus far been positive
but relatively small. The best performance has been on those plantations and
estates which had been most efficiently run prior to the reform and which have
kept their former management. Problems of decapitalization and inefficiencies
owing to the lack of managerial experience and technical expertise did, however,
occur. A major current problem in the agricultural sector is the uncertainty
that the land reform has created for the remaining medium-sized private land-
owners who still account for most of the food supplied to the urban markets.
The Government has attempted to assuage their doubts by issuing certificates
of exemption from expropriation, but these "guarantees" are heavily conditioned.
The Government has recently issued a blanket exemption to private holdings of
15 ha or less. While this increases the security of small farmers, the move
may paradoxically have increased the uncertainties felt by the owners of larger
farms, now limited by law to 50 ha.
24.       One drawback of the agrarian reform is that the process of expropria-
tion and structural reorganization has been emphasized at the expense of tech-
nical assistance and other programs in both the reformed and private sectors.
Long-term investment credit, for example, has been severely constrained by
the shortage of qualified field personnel in the national Agrarian Bank. In
an effort to attack this and other problems, the Ministry of Agriculture was
divided into two ministries in 1975. One of them, the Ministry of Food (MA),
was given responsibility for agricultural production programs; the other,
which retained the title of Ministry of Agriculture, has responsibility for
land and water development and agrarian reform. This reorganization has not
yet had significant results, while creating additional difficulties of coor-
dination. At the same time, little has been done to alleviate the plight of
minifundistas who, particularly in the Sierra, live in extreme rural poverty.



-9-
Current Government Policy
25.       The National Development Plan for 1975-78 aims at consolidating
the Agrarian Reform Program initiated in 1968 and at increasing the rate of
growth of agricultural output, particularly of import substitutes. Meat
imports have been significantly reduced through restrictions on consumption
and the promotion of alternative foods. In addition, farmers are legally
obliged to devote at least 40% of their arable land to foodcrops. Despite
these efforts, Peru's food imports are likely to continue to grow, at least
through the medium term, since Peru is not well endowed for agriculture.
26.       The Government has recently initiated a nationwide agricultural
production acceleration program under the Direccion General de Produccion
(DGP) within the Ministry of Food. In this new attempt to respond to the
needs of the country for greatly increased agricultural output, "production
nuclei" are being formed, consisting of farmers committing themselves to
the production of certain agricultural products or crops. Once the production
program proposed by a particular "nucleus" (which may be a farmers' coopera-
tive or may even consist of only one farmer) has been approved and found to
conform to the zonal and national production program and objectives, it is
supplied with the necessary support services, including agricultural extension,
credit, crop insurance and marketing of the production. The emphasis under
the new program is on farm units ranging in size from 3.5 ha to 15 ha; these
receive the most complete production acceleration "package" of services.
Irrigation
27.       Of the total of 3.6 million ha of cropland in Peru, about one-
third, or 1 million ha, are irrigated, of which 770,000 ha are located in
52 small valleys in the Coastal region of Peru. This region, where six of the
ten largest urban centers are located and where 40% of the total population
live, produces about two-thirds of the country's total value of agricultural
output. With precipitation in most of the coastal area close to zero,
irrigation is essential for agricultural production. In general, where water
is available conditions are favorable for high crop production owing to po-
tentially good soils and near optimal solar radiation and temperature regimes.
28.       Peru's irrigated coastal valleys have for centuries been the primary
source of food production in the country.  In modern times much of this area
was cultivated in large holdings. Development of irrigation and drainage
systems, together with on-farm development, was left to private owners with
minimal intervention by Government.  The irrigation systems are antiquated
and generally inadequate to achieve efficient water management and optimum
use of the land and water resources. Effective drainage systems were never
constructed, and over a period of many years dissolved salts from soils in
the upper parts of the valleys have gradually contaminated the groundwater.
This saline water has moved downstream by surface or underground flow causing
an excessive accumulation of salts in the lower part of the valleys which,
together with a high groundwater table, has resulted in moderate to severe
waterlogging and salinization of large areas of land; production has suffered



- 10 -
as a result. It is estimated that a total of 150,000 ha, or 20% of all
coastal irrigable lands, are severely affected, with an additional 100,000
ha affected to a lesser degree. Fortunately the lands may be reclaimed
and restored to their original condition by flooding and leaching if
coupled with adequate drainage.
29.       Facing the problem of scarce land resources, a rapidly growing
population and an unfavorable trade balance, the Government has decided to
initiate a program to rehabilitate once fertile lands in the coastal zone,
as had been recommended in the Bank's 1975 Agricultural Sector Survey
Report (549a-PE). The Government now considers rehabilitation of existing
districts an important means of rapidly increasing agricultural output and
of consolidating its agrarian reform program and is therefore now giving
greater emphasis to rehabilitation of existing areas as compared with
costlier, new irrigation schemes. Not only will rehabilitation bring back
into full production lands which, over the years, had to be taken out of
production, but it will also halt further deterioration and reduction of
the presently cultivated area and yields.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project Concept
30.       Bank and FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program staff have worked with
Peruvian officials in formulating the project, which would be the first in
a series of irrigation rehabilitation projects the Government is planning.
The project area would consist of six coastal valleys, namely Mala, Pisco
and Cahnete in the central coastal zone and Camana, Majes and Tambo in the
southern part of the country. These valleys were selected for the first
stage of the long-term rehabilitation program because their relatively high
level of agricultural development, good infrastructure base and adequate
water supply--in cormparison with other valleys--make it possible to increase
significantly cultivation and production quickly. The project would consist
of:
(a) reclaiming about 19,000 ha of salt-affected and waterlogged
land which would increase both the area of arable land and
agricultural production in the six valleys. This aspect of
the project would directly benefit 4,000 families;
(b) rehabilitating and constructing main and secondary irrigation
and drainage systems for about 33,000 ha, including the
19,000 ha to be reclaimed.  This would improve the delivery
and use of irrigated water and provide some needed drainage
facilities;



- 11 -
(c)  imprcving the presently inadequate operation and maintenance
of existing irrigation systems throughout the six valleys,
covering 68,300 ha and nearly 15,000 farms. Support services
to farmers would also be strengthened with an emphasis on
better water management and land preparations and new head-
quarters would be constructed in each valley to serve as
operating bases for all irrigation-related activities; and
(d)  consultant services to assist in (i) the design and super-
vision of construction of drainage systems; (ii) the estab-
lishment of adequate operational and maintenance services in
the valleys; (iii) the carrying out of the land reclamation
phase of the project; (iv) the supervision of a program of
groundwater investigation in the Mala and Pisco Valleys;
(v) the organization of extension and training services in
the project area; and (vi) preparing feasibility studies for
a similar project in other coastal valleys.
The project will also provide support, and help consolidate, the Agrarian
Reform Program. In this respect, assurances have been obtained from Government
that the process of agrarian reform in the project area will be completed dur-
ing the course of project implementation, in accordance with the existing laws
(Section 3.04 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Cost and Financing
31.       The cost of the project is estimated at US$40.9 million, equivalent,
with an estimated foreign exchange component of US$15.3 million. The Bank
loan would cover US$14.6 million of the foreign exchange costs and US$10.4
million of local costs. The remaining US$0.7 million of foreign exchange
costs will be provided by the Netherlands under a technical assistance agree-
ment.
32.       The Bank loan would constitute about 60%e of the total cost of the
project, and would cover about 40% of its local costs. As discussed in
paragraph 14 above, local currency financing is justified in Peru in view of
the country's balance of payments position and its efforts to mobilize domestic
resources. The Netherlands Government will provide the equivalent of US$1.0
million of technical assistance (US$0.7 million for foreign exchange and US$0.3
million for local costs). The Government's contribution of the equivalent of
US$14.9 million to cover the balance of the estimated total cost would be met
by annual budgetary appropriations.

Market and Production Aspects
33.       Major crops grown in the project area are cotton, together with
maize and potatoes in one basic cropping pattern, and rice followed by beans
in another basic rotation. Although agricultural production systems in the
area are already at a relatively high level of technology, yields except for
rice, are generally low and are reportedly decreasing for most of the crops
due to worsening salinity problems. This trend would be reversed with the
project and the estimated annual incremental net value of production at full
development will be about constant 1975 US$13.2 million.  Marketing of the
output would involve no serious problems since transportation and processing
facilities are already available in the project area and since there is a
present as well as long-range need for crops grown in the project area.
Implement at ion
34.       The Ministry of Agriculture (MAG) would have overall responsibility
for carrying out the project. The Direccion General de Aguas (DGA), a de-
partment in the MAG, would be responsible for planning and final design, pre-
paration of specifications and tender documents, entering into contracts and
supervision of construction. Following the normal procedure in Peru for
large and complex projects, a special project unit known as "Plan de Rehabilita-
cion de Tierras Costeras" (PLANREHATIC) has been established under the adminis-
tration of DGA and would be responsible for executing the proposed project and
similar projects in other coastal valleys. The special unit would have autonomy
and flexibility in managing day-to-day operations and coordinating the parti-
cipation of other agencies.  These include the Direccion General de Reforma
Agraria y Asentamiento Rural as regards agrarian reform and the Direccion General
de Irrigaciones (DGI) for assisting the special unit on studies, design and
execution of those works for improvement and construction of irrigation systems.
PLAIJREHATIC would also have authority to receive and expend project funds for
civil works, to purchase equipment, materials and supplies and to carry out
other services. It would also have authority, on behalf of MAG, to arrange
for the participation of other ministries or agencies for specific assistance
in executing and managing the project.
35.       The Ministry of Food (MA) would give special emphasis to agricul-
tural supporting services, through its Direccion General de Produccion (DGP),
to the production program in the six valleys and particularly in the reclaimed
areas.  The Servicio Nacional de Mecanizacion Agricola (SENAMA), under the MA
would participate in providing improved mechanization services in the project
area, particularly in the reclaimed areas, and organizing and managing the
expanded service for operation and maintenance.  MAG and MA would coordinate
their efforts in providing for improvement and intensification of supporting
services in the project area, particularly extension assistance under the
production programs administered by DGP, and would enter into an agreement for
organization and management by SENAMIA of expanded operation and maintenance
services throughout the irrigated areas in the six valleys (Section 3.05 of
the draft Loan Agreement).



- 13 -
36.       The Banco Agrario del Peru (BAP) would act as a banking agent for
development credit loans to farmers or cooperative associations for on-farm
development, under an agreement to be entered into between the Government and
BAP (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement); execution of such agreement
will be a condition of effectiveness of the loan (Section 6.01 (a) of the
draft Loan Agreement). BAP would grant these loans on the basis of plans and
cost estimates prepared by PLANREHATIC which would contract to have the work
performed. The loans would have a term of 20 years including a grace period
of up to 5 years and an interest rate of not less than 10%0 (Section 3.02
of the Loan Agreement). This minimum interest rate, although negative at
the current annual price increases in Peru, is expected to be positive over
the life of the loans and is compatible with the need to provide incentives
to maintain production on newly settled small farms.
37.       The project would be executed over six and a half years, 1977-1983,
with 1977 and 1978 devoted to preparing final designs, specifications and con-
tract documents and construction scheduled to begin early in 1979. Work would
proceed on two fronts, i.e., the three northern valleys and the three southern
valleys, on a staggered schedule commencing in one valley on each front with
the other two valleys scheduled to follow at about one-year intervals. Based
on the characteristics of the soils it is estimated that five years could be
required following completion of construction to carry out leaching and re-
establish fertility so as to achieve full production on all the affected
areas in the 19,000 ha to be reclaimed.
Procurement and Disbursement
38.       Contracting for construction of major project works (US$8.2 million),
on-farm development (US$5.2 million), and purchase of major items of imported
equipment (US$5.6 million), would be carried out through international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. For purposes of bid
comparison, Peruvian manufacturers of material and equipment would be entitled
to a preference of 15% or the applicable tariff, whichever is less. Contracts for
construction of service centers, and for purchase of drainage pipe or tile and
minor items of imported technical and office equipment which cannot be grouped
in lots of at least US$50,000 would be done on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures, which are satis-
factory to the Bank. Vehicles and wheeled tractors would not be purchased
with loan funds as under Peruvian law this equipment must be procured from
local assembly plants without competitive bidding.
39.       Since works in the six valleys are to be staggered, it would be
necessary to let contracts on a valley-by-valley basis. This would reduce the
value of the contracts and it is expected that these contracts would be awarded
rLostly to local contractors, who are well organized with staff and equipment,
and are fully competent to perform the work.



- 14 -
4o.       Consultant services to assist with design and supervision of con-
struction of drainage systems would be provided by the Government of the
Netherlands under a bilateral agreement with the Government of Peru. Addi-
tional consultants to be provided under the loan would be retained following
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. The average cost of consultant services
to be provided under the loan has been estimated at about $80,000 per man-year.
41.       The proposed loan would be disbursed over a period of six years.
The loan would be disbursed against (i) 60% of the cost for civil works includ-
ing buildings; (ii) 75% of development credit loans for on-farm development;
(iii) the foreign cost of directly imported equipment and 80% of the cost for
imported equipment purchased locally; (iv) 90% of ex-factory cost of eligible
equipment manufactured locally; and (v) 100% of foreign expenditures for
consultant services or 100% of the salaries of locally recruited consultants.
Cost Recovery
42.        The impact of the project on its beneficiaries has been analyzed for
three farm types considered to be typical for the area. The per capita income,
including family labor, but after project charges and before property and in-
come taxes, would increase in constant 1975 US dollars from US$206 to US$343
for a 3-ha farm, from US$262 to US$565 for a 8-ha farm and from US$337 to
US$840 for a 15-ha farm.
43.        Project charges would be introduced as facilities and on-farm develop-
ment works are completed. Such charges will be sufficient to cover operational
and maintenance costs and will seek to assure reasonable recovery of investment
costs. The extent of investment cost recovery will initially be determined in
the light of socioeconomic studies to be carried out in each valley and reviewed
with the Bank. The charges will thereafter be reviewed with the Bank at least
once every two years to evaluate the effect of changes in prices on the value
of the investment and to make adjustments in these charges as required (Section
3.06 of the draft Loan Agreement). For the purpose of the financial analysis,
and on the basis of current operation and maintenance and investment costs
estimates, it has been assumed that annual incremental development charges in
constant 1975 terms would average US$10/ha/year for operation and maintenance,
US$9.24/ha/year for capital recovery, excluding the on-farm development com-
ponent, and US$38.22/ha/year for the on-farm development component, or a total
of US$57.46/ha/year in case the farm invests in on-farm drains and leveling.
Such assumed charges would cover operation and maintenance costs and allow full
recovery of investment costs in 40 years without interest and would represent
23 and 28% of incremental net farm benefits for small- and medium-sized farms,
respectively.

Economic Analysis
44.       The project's principal aim is to increase agricultural production
at low cost and in a relatively short period of time. This will result in
increased earnings and improved living conditions for some 4,000 families
in the area of 19,000 ha of reclaimed land and for another 13,200 families
in the remaining 49,300 ha which would benefit from the project. It is ex-
pected that out of the 4,000 families primarily benefitting from the project
investments, about 2,500 families presently have family incomes from the land
of less than US$200 per capita which is considered as the poverty income level
for 1975. Out of the 13,200 families benefitting from minor improvements,
9,000 families are considered to have present incomes from the land below the
poverty income level.
45.       Incremental production of crops, mainly cotton, basic grains and
fruit and vegetables would amount to US$13.2 million annually at full develop-
ment. There would be a net gain of US$11.3 million annually at constant
US dollars in the balance of payments situation at full development, taking
into consideration the increased export of cotton fiber and sugar, the re-
duced imports of basic grains and the increased imports of project investment
goods and farm inputs such as machinery, fertilizers, and chemicals.
46.       The economic rate of return of the project is estimated at approxi-
mately 18%. If investment costs were assumed to increase by 10% and benefits
to decrease by 10%o, the project's rate of return would still be a satisfactorv 14%.
47.       The project would also have substantial unquantifiable benefits
through assisting in consolidating the Agrarian Reform Program, strengthening
government institutions, and improving the capability to carry out similar
future programs in other valleys.
Conclusions, Recommendations, Risks
48.       Peruvian agricultural performance has been poor in that output has
lagged behind population growth and accelerated production is now critically
needed to reduce food imports and increase rural employment and incomes.
The best current opportunity for the Bank to aid in this objective is the
first agricultural rehabilitation project because of its combined benefits in
reversing the trend of deterioration of soils and making more effective use
of existing productive capacity and infrastructure in Peru's coastal zone.
Project risks are no greater than can normally be expected with operations of
this type.
49.       The most important of the agreed  covenants are concerned with
(a) the establishment of water charges sufficient to cover operation and
maintenance ccsts and to assure a reasonable recovery of investment costs;
(b) ensuring that the agrarian reform in the project area will be completed,
along the lines enunciated in current legislation, during the project execu-
tion period; and (c) ensuring the Government's commitment to improve and
strengthen agricultural supporting services and operation and maintenance
services.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Peru and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of the draft Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
51.       The draft Loan Agreement conforms to the normal pattern for loans
for irrigation rehabilitation projects. A special condition of the effective-
ness of the loan is the execution of an agreement between the Borrower and
Banco Agrario del Peru. As in previous loans to or to be guaranteed by the
Republic of Peru, the Republic of Peru must approve the legal instruments
therefor by a Supreme Decree to be issued after Board approval and before loan
signature.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -/
Loan 706-PE: Road Reconstruction Project: US$30.0 ruillion Loan of September 14,
1970; Effective Date: October 26, 1970; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
This Loan was signed only three and a half months after the earthquake
in the Callejon de Huaylas. However, the identification, feasibility study and
final engineering of the roads to be improved have taken much longer than expected
because of a too optimistic assessment at the time of appraisal, because of
administrative and coordination difficulties in connection with the on-going
decentralization of the Central Government, and because of problems with the
consultants engaged to study and supervise the project.  These problems were over-
come and the project is near completion.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Loan 933-PE:  Agricultural Credit Project; US$25.0 million Loan of September
12, 1973; Effective Date: December 12, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The Loan was signed in September 1973 and became effective on
December 12, 1973. Although the project had a slow start, progress is now
satisfactory. Disbursements are slightly behind schedule, but they are
expected to be completed by the original Closing Date of the Loan.
Loan 949-PE:  Education Project; US$24.0 million Loan of December 5, 1973;
Effective Date: March 5, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This Loan became effective on March 5, 1974. Serious initial delays
were caused by administrative difficulties with the Project Unit and late
appointment of counterpart staff to the consultants who were to define curricula
for the ESEPs (Escuelas Superiores de Ensenanza Profesional). The change of
status of the Project Unit which has been upgraded to the rank of Directorate
General and the strengthened management of the project have markedly improved
the prospects for efficient implementation of the project. At present 24 basic
cycle school designs have been approved by the Bank and construction contracts
are being bid. ESEPs are now being designed and are expected to be contracted
during 1977.
Loan 1025-PE: Sixth Highway Project; US$26.0 million Loan of July 1, 1974;
Effective Date: August 21, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Bids for construction works were invited in October 1974, on the
basis of the official cost estimates, but contractors failed to respond.
After an upward revision of the cost estimates new invitations to bid were
issued in March 1975. Contractors response this time has been positive and
bids for all sections have been submitted and contracts were awarded in August
1975. Project implementation is about one year behind schedule.
Loan 1196-PE: Lima-Amazon Transport Corridor Project; US$76.5 million Loan of
May 27, 1976; Effective Date: August 18, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The road component of the project is about six months behind schedule.
Following recent supervision missions it is expected that project implementa-
tion will be accelerated to the projected pace.
Loan 1215-PE: Fifth Power Project; US$36.0 million Loan of September 20, 1976;
Effective Date: November 18, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1979
Beneficiary initiated bidding procedures immediately after signature,
and project implementation is substantially on schedule.

Project implementation activities started immediately after Loan
approval and it is expected that project implementation will proceed on
schedule.
Loan 1285-PE:  Centromin Mining Project; US$40.0 million Loan of December 6,
