INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIOJN OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO TELEPHONE COMPANY LTD.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Trinidad and Tobago Telephone Company Limited (TELCO), with the guarantee
of Trinidad and Tobago, for the equivalent of $18.0 million to help finance
a project for rehabilitating and expanding the telephone network in Trinidad
and Tobago. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including four years of
grace, with interest at 71 per annum. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago
would charge TELCO a guarantee fee of up to 1% per annum on the outstanding
amount of the Bank loan, bringing the cost of the loan to TElICO to up to
8 per annum.
PART I. THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.        The Bank's latest economic report entitled "Report on Employment
in Trinidad and Tobago" (53-TR) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on February 2, and its conclusions were discussed at a Board Economic Seminar
on March 1, 1973. An updating economic mission, which visited the country
in October/November 1973, is nov preparing its report; a brief account of
its findings has been included in this report. A summary of Country Basic
Data is attached as Annex I.   v
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
3.        Petroleum production and refining plays a dominant role in the
economy of Trinidad and Tobago. In 1972, these activities accounted for
about one-fifth of GNP, two-thirds of merchandise exports, and close to one-
fourth of the central government's revenues. As a result of recent favorable
developments in the petroleum sector, the country's economic prospects have
changed dramatically. An important new oilfield off the east coast came
into production at the beginning of 1972, and the output of domestic crude
oil from all sources is now projected to reach 90 million barrels a year in
1976, or close to double the 1971 figure.. In addition, substantial natural
gas resources have been found in the same general area, and some production
has already started. These developments have coincided with a fourfold
increase in the world petroleum prices since early 1973.
4.        This turn of events must be viewed, however, within the context of
other economic developments during the late sixties and early seventies in
Trinidad and Tobago. Petroleum production declined from 65 million barrels
in 1967 to 47 million in 1971 because of the depletion of reserves from
traditional producing areas. This decline coincided with weaknesses in
agriculture and tourism, and was only partially offset by the continuing
growth of manufacturing industry which was stimulated by the establishment of
the Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARTFTA) in 1968. During the decade
of the 1960s, Trinidad and Tobago's GDP rose at an annual average rate of 4%,



- 2 -
or about 2% per capita, but real GDP growth amounted to only 2.5'S in 1972
and may have been negative in 1973. The balance of payments deteriorated
sharply during 1972 and 1973. Prior to 1972, a widening deficit on the
trade account had been compensated by increasing direct private investment,
and the reserve position had remained sound. With the completion of a
number of major projects in the petroleum sector, however, directl private
investment declined in 1973. There was also evidence of a short- term capital
flight prompted by fears of devaluation. As a result, the reserves of the
banking system fell from $41 million in November 1972 to $27 million in
November 1973, equivalent to only two weeks' imports. This development was
even more serious when placed in the context of substantial government borrowing
on the Eurodollar market.
5.        In the face of sluggish economic growth, inflationary pressures have built
up since 1972 -- a development which should be viewed against the background
of stable prices which Trinidad and Tobago has traditionally enjoyed. In
1972, retail prices rose by 9.3% and in 1973 by a further 15%. Three factors
can be identified as the principal cause of this unprecedented rise in
prices: first, the effects of accelerating world inflation were particularly
acute in the case of Trinidad and Tbbago where merchandise imports amount to
almost 40% of CLDP; second, agricultural production was hit by a severe drought,
and the supply of local foodstuffs was much less than normal; third, mounting
fiscal deficits caused the government to increase its borrowing from the
banking system, particularly from the Central Bank.
6.        The slow growth in output, the shortcomings of the educational
system, and a steady emigration of skilled personnel have combined to create
a problem of persistent unemployment. Despite the low growth rate of the
labor force, the econony has failed to generate sufficient new employment
opportunities, as the increase in employment between 1965 and 1971 was only
1.2% per annum. Unemployment now stands at 14% of the labor force, and the
link between poverty and unemployment gives rise to social tensions.
Continuing unemployment is all the more striking in a country with such a relatively
high per capita GNP as Trinidad and Tobago ($1009 in 1972), and a resolution
of this problem must rank as one of the most pressing current issues.
7.        The public sector in Trinidad and Tobago expanded consicerably during
the 1960s, and overall public expenditures increased from 21% of CDP to 28%
over the period 1960-71. The disturbances of 1970 increased the government's
concern for the unemployment problem, and both investment and current expendi-
tures were stepped up, with particular emphasis on social services. The twin
pressures of declining oil production (resulting in low government oil revenues)
and increasing public expenditures caused the fiscal situation to deteriorate
in 1970. Except for the introduction of an unemployment levy, no important
new revenue measures have been introduced in recent years. There have been
mounting fiscal deficits since 1970, resulting in heavy external a:nd domestic
borrowing by the public sector.



8.        This year, faced with the precipitous rise in petroleum prices,
the government introduced radical changes in petroleum taxation in its
budget. As a result, the government expects that current revenues will
rise to TT$920 million -- double the level of 1973. The budget envisages
an overall surplus on both current and capital accounts of TT$290 million
in 1974 after meeting all amortization obligations due on the public debt.
The government's projections may prove conservative, however, and current
receipts might rise to as much as TT$1.2 billion in 1974 and to TT$2.4 billion
in 1978.
9.        Despite the higher revenues from petroleum, the 1974 budget expendi-
tures have been expanded only modestly, in keeping with the government's view
that high oil prices are only a temporary phenomenon. At this stage at least,
the government has avoided establishing high levels of expenditure which
could not be sustained in subsequent years should oil prices decline. Instead,
the full amount of the 1974 surplus has been credited to a number of
"Special Funds" to finance future investments which the government considers
basic to the strategy of its forthcoming Fourth Five-Year Development Plan
(1974-78). The plan is likely to be heavily biased towards the use of local
petroleum and gas resources for the country's industrial development. Plans
have been announced to establish a third major refinery, a second ammonia
plant and a second cement plant. Discussions are also underway regarding
the feasibility of an iron pelletizing plant, an alumina/aluminum complex,
and facilities to liquify natural gas for export to the US market. The
moderate increase in 1974 in current expenditures will be directed towards
assisting the lower income groups by improving social benefits. Efforts
will be made to control inflation by using subsidies to underpin the prices
of basic items of consumption, such as rice, wheat, and gasoline.
10.       Price subsidies should assist in bringing inflation under control
in 1974. The tradition of price stability is deeply ingrained, and neither
the business community nor savers and consumers show signs of an "inflationary
psychology."  There are good prospects that agriculture will recover from
the drought of 1973 and that the supply of both locally produced and imported
foodstuffs will increase sufficiently to ease the pressure on prices. The
improved foreign exchange situation will enable the government to institute
a liberal import policy and therE5y ease the aggregate supply.   Finally,
because of the strengthened fiscal situation, the government will not need
to continue inflationary borrowing. The resolution of the government to fight
inflation, backed by ample financial resources, gives reason to assume that,
after 1974, inflation may be reduced to no more than the general world level.
11.       The precise impact of t.he increased petroleum revenues on Trinidad
and Tobago's employment situatior. is more difficult to predict, especially
since the Fourth Development Plan is not yet finalized. In general, the
increased revenues should present to the government an excellent opportunity
to tackle this and a number of other basi- economic and social problems which
have become acute in the recent past. Only a comprehensive strategy can over-
come such problems as faltering economic growth and high unemployment, and



foreign exchange requirements should no longer be a constraint. However,
to implement a comprehensive development scheme, the absorptive capacity
of the administration will be a limiting factor, and serious lack of
experienced manpower is likely to continue particularly at the middle levels.
Thus, efforts to improve administrative capabilities, particular:Ly in the
areas of project planning and administration, will have a great bearing on
the rate of economic growth and social progress. With the aid of' high
petroleum revenues,which should accrue from the second half of 1974 onwards,
GNP potentially should be able to increase at an annual rate of 13% in real
terms over the period of the Fourth Development Plan.
External Assistance and Creditworthiness
12.       Due to sluggish public sector investment during most of the 1960s,
external capital flows to Trinidad and Tobago's public sector have been
relatively modest. On a disbursement basis, they amounted to $1110 million
in 1966-72. As against this, the inflow of net private investment capital
in the same period totaled $h20 million, most of it in 1970-72 wlen new
petroleum production facilities were established. Official loan commitments
were accelerated over the period 1967-73; a summary of these commitments is given

13.        Trinidad and Tobago's public investment requirements in the medium
term are expected to be substantial considering the need for economic diversi-
fication. There are good prospects that these requirements will be met largely
from domestic resources as long as petroleum prices remain high. In addition,
the government should also be able to make provisions out of its foreign
exchange earnings during the coming two or three years for contributions to
build up its reserve position from the low 1973 levels, to liquidate its
short-term debts including sums borrowed on the Eurodollar market at high
rates of interest, and to respond favorably to requests for assistance from
its CARICOM  I partners which are facing serious difficulty in coping with
high import bills. Finally, the government has committed itself, in principle,
to purchase IDB and Bank bonds in an effort to contribute to the lending
resources of both institutions.  Spe ific arrangements for this will be dis-
cussed between the Bank and the Trin:.dad and Tobago government later this year.
14.        Trinidad and Tobago has ample creditworthiness for borrowing on
conventional terms. The external public debt of the country is very low
by international standards; at the end of 197?, it equaled 11% of GDP with
a debt service ratio of 3%, and this is expected to fall to 9% and 2.4)%,
respectively, by 1979. The Bank's share in the total amount outstanding and
disbursed is 24% at present, while its share in the debt service is 28%. These
shares may increase somewhat in the next few years as Trinidad and Tobago
repays many medium and short term debt obligations which have been contracted
at high interest rates. At the same time, the country should begin to receive
interest and principal repayments of its purchases of securities issued by
the Bank and other development institutions.
15.        Trinidad and Tobago is now at a critical period in its development.
During this transition period, external aid agencies may be particularly
helpful in assisting the government, specifically in the fields of policy
planning and institutional improvement. This will require new relationships
to be worked out between Trinidad and Tobago and present and potential aid
agencies, including the Bank Group.
PART II - BANK GROUP OFERATIONS IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
16.        The Bank made its first loan to Trinidad and Tobago in FY1962, a
loan of $21.4 million, guaranteed by the United Kingdom, for electric power.
Since then, Bank lending has totaled $51.3 million for eight projects, including
two in agriculture, two in education, and one each in highways, power, and
family planning, and a development finance company operation. A summary
statement of Bank loans to Trinidad and Tobago and notes regarding the progress
of projects in execution as of February 28, 1974 are attached as Annex II.
g/ CARICOM (Caribbean Community including the Common Market) was formed in
1973 by Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago over and above
the CARIFTA organization; on May 1, 1974, the other CARIFTA partners with
the exception of Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Anguilla joined CARICOM.



17.       Until the recent change in the petroleum situation, Bank lending in
Trinidad and Tobago was designed to contribute to the transfer of external
re2ources, to improve the country's infrastructure, to increase its output and
employment, and to contribute to institutional development. Assuming that
oil prices will not drop significantly from present levels and that the volume
of Trinidad and Tobago's oil exports will rise as now expected, the consequent
rise in Trinidad and Tobago's per capita income will give it increasing access
to international capital markets. In these circumstances, there is need for
a broad review of the Bank's operations in Trinidad and Tobago. Discussions
to that effect between the Bank and the government have not yet been completed
but they are likely to lead to an understanding that the Bank's operations in
Trinidad and Tobago will gradually be phased out over the next several years.
Until then, the government would be looking tc the Bank for assistance in
institution building efforts so as to remove the technical, managerial, and
administrative bottlenecks which from now on will be the major constraint on
economic growth. At the same time, the government of Trinidad and Tobago
would contribute to the Bank's lending resources at a scale at least sufficient to
reverse the net flow of funds between Trinidad and Tobago and the Bank.
As stated above, details remain to be worked out, but our discus3ions with
the government on this subject so far have been highly encouraging.
18.       Within this framework, we are active in Trinidad and Tobago notably
in rural development, education, family planning, manufacturing, and transporta-
tion. In the agricultural sector, the Bank made a loan for rehalaiitating
Trinidad and Tobago's sugar industry (Ln. 888-TR). We now expect to encourage
development of the small-holder sector through two loans for rural development/
land settlement projects designed to continue the program initiated under the
Crown Lands project (Ln. 486-TR). Both projects will promote agricultural
diversification and improve production of livestock and crops, together with
social amenities. The first such project, to be located in Tobago and the
northeastern and southwestern parts of Trinidad, will be appraised shortly.
It will improve agricultural production in areas already under cultivation
by strengthening infrastructure, expanding credit and extension services,
and by providing marketing services.   The project will also bring unused
Crown Lands under cultivation.
19.       In order to diversify its economic base, and despite its relatively
high wage levels, Trinidad is promoting industrial production for increased
domestic consumption and exports. The government is encouraging the develop-
ment of manufacturing industries through a variety of incentives, and financing
is being provided by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) and the
Trinidad and Tobago Development Finance Company (TTDFC). The first Bank loan
to assist industrial diversification was made to TTDFC in 1972, and a $5.0 million
loan for a follow-up project will be negotiated shortly.
20.       In the social sector, a third education project would continue to
assist the government in implementing its "Plan for Educational Development
(1968-83)", to improve the educational system's relevance and efliciency.
Similarly, a second population project would continue the Bank's support of
the government's population planning efforts.



-7-
21.       In infrastructure, the country's transportation system has not kept
pace with the requirements of a growing economy; as a result, production and
distribution costs are higher than they need to be. With regard to highways,
there is need for technical assistance to help in developing the local contract-
ing industry, in improving the operations of the Highway Department of the
Ministry of Works, and, on the basis of a highway maintenance study shortly
to be initiated by CIDA, in strenghtening highway maintenance in the'country.
These requirements will be taken care of in a project scheduled for appraisal
around the end of the year. A project for improvement of Port-of-Spain's port
was first appraised by the Bank in 1965; until recently, however, there had
been no agreement between the government and the Bank on the scope and financial
plan of it. A revised project, providing for berths, quays, sheds, and equip-
ment, has now been presented by the government to the Bank, and it is planned
that it will be appraised in September. The project would also aim at sub-
stantially improving the technical and financial management of the port operations.
In telecomrunications, as indicated in paragraph 43 below, there is also much
justification for Bank support of the government's efforts to improve and expand
the operations of the sector.
22.       The implementation of the projects listed above would be an integral
part of the government's overall development efforts, as set out in the draft
Fourth Development Plan (1974-78). It would also be in close harmony with
IDB's and CIDA's program of activities in Trinidad and Tobago. IDB is
cooperating closely with the Bank especially in connection with its agricultural
development projects. CIDA is financing, or will finance, various studies
which may serve as basis for Bank projects. In addition, 'CIDA and the United
Kingdom government (CDA) are providing experts and fellowships needed in
conjunction with the Bank's second education project.
23.       So far there have been no operations of the International Finance
Corporation in Trinidad and Tobago which became a member of IFC in 1971.
However, IFC is now considering possible investments in a plant to manufacture
furfural and acetic acid and a plant to manufCcture ammonia.
PART III.  TERECONMUNICATIONS IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
24.       With the exception of some long distance circuits for private users
and military and civil aviation communications, all telecommunications in
Trinidad and Tobago are managed by two companies. The government-owned
Trinidad and Tobago Telephone Company Limited (TELCO) is responsible for all
national telephone and telex services, and the Trinidad and Tobago External
Telecommunications Company Limited (TEXTEL), which is jointly owned by the
government (51%) and Cable and Wireless Limited of UK (49%), is responsible
for all national telegraph services, maritime services, and international
telecommunications facilities.
25.       The telephone density in Trinidad and Tobago, with 6.6 telephones
per 100 persons, is relatively high for a developing country but is still far
below the density in developed countries. As of December 31, 1973, 31 local
automatic and three small manual exchanges were being operated with a total



-8-
installed capacity of 50,716 lines with 41,524 connected lines. Long distance
services are provided by VHF radio and microwave systems, in addition to open
wire carriers and VF cables. There are only three telegraph offices in the
country, in Scarborough, Port-of-Spain, and San Fernando; radio circuits are
used for message transmission. International commmunications are provided by
an earth satellite station to the US, UK, and Canada, by tropospheric scatter
systems to most West Indian islands, Guyana, and Surinam, and by VHF radio
system to Grenada and Venezuela. An average daily traffic of about 800
international calls is handled over 74 international telephone circuits.
26.        TELCO's existing exchanges and long distance network are, however,
inadequate in quantity, quality, and reliability to meet the countryts devel-
opment needs. Lack of continuous and proper planning in the past has led to a
number of deficiencies in the telephone network, causing poor serl-ice. There is
a large unfilled demand, congestion on local and long distance service, and
high fault incidence with extended outages in the local telephone system. As
at January 1974, the waiting list contained about 22,000 applications, or more
than half of the existing connections. Congestion of the local service is
caused partly by a flat rate tariff which encourages traffic beyond the handling
capacity of the system. TEICO plans to overcome this during the project period
by a restructuring of its rates. Congestion through lack of adequate capacity also
hampers both the local and long distance service. In addition, unsatisfactory
conditions of cables and drop wires are causing high fault incidence of outdoor
plant, and inadequate fault clearance methods result in extended outages.
PART IV.   THE PROJECT
27.        The project was appraised in the field in June 1973 and was updated
in March 1974. Negotiations for the proposed loan were delayed pending
action on the required rate increases, and took place in Washington only in
April. The government delegation was headed by Mr. D. Maharaj, Acting
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance; the Borrower's delegation was
headed by Mr. S. Wilson, General Manager of TELCO.
28.        A report entitled "Trinidad and Tobago; Trinidad and To'bago Telephone
Company Limited (TELCO); Appraisal of a Telecommunications Project (No. 260a-TR, dated
April 30, 1974)" is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
The main features of the loan and of the project are summarized in Annex III.
The Borrower
29.         The proposed loan would be made to TELCO and would be guaranteed by
the government; TELCO would bear the foreign exchange risk. TEL[O is a limited
liability company, incorporated under the Companies' Ordinance. The Trinidad
and Tobago Telephone Act (Act No. 7 of 1968) provides for the tranvsfer and
vesting in TELCO in absolute ownership of the country's telephone system and
for the future operation and regulation of the'system. The company was formerly
owned equally by Continental Telephone Corporation (CTC) of U.S. and the
Trinidad and Tobago government. In November 1972, the government purchased
the stock held by CTC, and TELCO is now fully government-owned.



TELCO operates as a commercial corporation and pays taxes on profits and
customs duties on imported equipment. It is managed by a seven-member Board
of Directors nominated by the government, and its day to day operations are
entrusted to) a General Manager. The overall organizational setup is satisfactory,
except for the operational responsibilities in the Port-of-Spain district
where no single authority is responsible for plant maintenance. TELCO has
now reviewed the situation, and a reorganization, unifying maintenance respon-
sibility,will be implemented at the latest by July 1, 1974. A more effective
budgetary system and control procedures will also be operational from January 1, 1975.
30.        Senior engineering and financial staff are well qualified, experienced,
and capable of managing present and prospective operations. Additional training
is now being given to outdoor plant staff to broaden their capabilities in
maintenance procedures. Except for recruitment of some additional senior staff
and technical staff for maintaining common control switching and long distance
transmission equipment installed under the project, TEICO will not iaierease
the present level of staff until after completion of the project. TEI.COIs
present staff totals about 1,700, giving a staff ratio of about 26 per 1,000
telephones; this ratio will be improved to 21 per 1 ,000 on completion of the
project.
31.        TELCO's financial results were fairly satisfactory up to 1971
with rates of return of about 7%. However, recently they deteriorated rapidly:
the 1971 net income was TT$1 .3 million, the 1972 loss TT$46,000, and the 1973
loss around TT$2.3 million. There are various reasons for this deterioration;
they include a stagnation of the growth of the telecommunications network, a rapid
increase in the unit cost of plant added and labor costs, and, until recently,
a tariff unchanged since 1966. The result of inadequate net earnings on the
financial position has been aggravated by TELCO's assuming large amounts of
short term debt to finance its plant additicns. Recently, agreement was
reached between TELCO and local banks, and between TELCO and TEXTEL, on the
refinancing of TELCO's short term debts.
Project Description and Costs
32.        The proposed loan will assist in financing part of TEICO's five
year (1973-77) telecommunications program, which aims to improve the quality of
service to existing subscribers essentially by providing an adequate nunber of
high quality circuits and rehabilitating damaged cables, and to meet part
of the demand for additional telephones. The program consists of:
(a)   rehabilitation of local distribution cables;
(b)   minor reconstruction works and facilities for metering local
calls in all exchanges;
(c)   installation of a microwave link between San Fernando and
La Brea/Point Fortin;



- 10 -
(d)   installation of about 26,000 lines of new local automatic
exchange equipment;
(e)   installation of local distribution and interoffice cables,
and subscribers' equipment to connect an additional
17,000 subscribers;
(f)   installation of microwave radio terminals and multiplex
equipment to provide about 1,400 additional long distance
circuits;
(g)   installation of a long distance automatic exchange with
about 3,000 long distance circuits; and
(h)   acquisition of land and construction of buildings to
house equipment.
This development program is modest, and will only provide 12,000 additional
connections up to 1977 and 17,000 additional connections up to 11978, a
growth equivalent to 6% per year in connected lines during the program
period (1973-1977). The total program, excluding interest during construction,
is estimated to cost $35.6 million, with a foreign exchange component of
$20.2 million.
33.        The project will cover the last four years of the program and
includes the above-mentioned components (d - h), costing an estimated $30.5
million with $1 8.0 million in foreign exchange (including $1 .8 million
interest during construction). Foreign cost estimates have been prepared
on the basis of recent price quotations obtained by TEICO from rarious
manufacturers and average prices, adjusted for recent currency parity changes,
obtained on international competitive bids under Bank loans. Local cost
estimates include customs duties at 25% ad valorem on all imporl;ed goods.
Provisions for price contingencies represent 18% of the project's foreign
costs and 20% of the project's local costs.
34.        In 1960, TELCO decided on (i) national numbering, switching, and
transmission plans, (ii) choice of common control switching equipment, and
(iii) choice and disposition of microwave systems for the long distance network.
These decisions were sound, and provide the framework for the least cost system
development. The fundamental network plans have since been based on the use of
common control switching equipment, and the first common control exchange was
installed in 1969. In continuance of this policy, common contrcl exchanges will
be installed under the project. Cable routes will be designed according to
standard plant practices which are based on economic period provision for
primary, secondary, and distribution cables, and provide the least cost solution.
A recent study by TELCO, reviewing the choice of microwave instead of coaxial
cable systems, confirmed that the microwave systems were more economical.



Project Execution
35.        TELCO's staff will be responsible for engineering designs, the
preparation of bid documents and technic-il specifications, and the evaluation
of bids. It will also lay, joint, and commission all distribution and inter-
office cables, supervise construction of cable ducts by local contractors, and
carry out acceptance tests of all installed equipment. Furthermore, TELCO
will provide staff to work under the contractor's supervision on installing
switching and long distance transmission equipment.
Procurement
36.        Procurement of all goods provided under the project will be by
international competitive bidding, in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines
for Procurement". Only private branch exchanges are now assembled locally,
and may be partly manufactured locally during the project period. Local
manufacturers will be accorded a protection of 15% of the cif price or the
actual tariff, whichever is lower. At the request of the government, goods
obtained from CARICOM countries will be similarly protected by 15% or the
difference in tariffs to external suppliers, whichever is lower. As the
project will not meet the total estimated demand, any unused balance left in
the loan account after completion of the project may, with prior Bank
approval, be used to finance additional equipment similar to that already
procured under the loan. Estimated annual disbursements of the loan are
given in Annex III of this report.
Financing Plan
37.        The proposed Bank loan of $18.0 million would fully finance the
foreign exchange costs of the project. However, it would comprise only about
38% of TELCO's total requirements of funds over the 1974-77 period.  Other
sources of finance would include a domestic bond issue by TELCO, additional equity,
and internal cash generation. The bond issue, which would provide for
22% of the requirements, will be the first issue placed on the local market
by a government corporation, and will therefore help in developing that market.
The government will underwrite the issue. New equity capital amounting to an
estimated TT$9.9 million will be contributed by the government, and will equal
TELCO's payments of customs duties on imported goods during the program period.
Dividend payments by TELCO would not be feasible during the constraction period;
hence, payments of dividends during the 1974-77 period will only be made
after agreement by the Bank. In the interest of sound financial management,
appropriate limitations on the incurrence of debt have also been accepted by the
proposed Borrower.
38.        TELCO's tariffs were set out in the Telephone Service Charges
Regulation of 1966. Their overall level, however, was inadequate to generate
a reasonable rate of return and provide funds necessary to expand and improve
the service. In September 1973, TELCO filed an application for a rate increase
of 60% with the Public Utilities Commission (PUG), a quasi-judicial body which
has to approve proposed rates in accordance with procedures and criteria set
out in the Telephone Act. The new rates were approved by the PUC in February
197h, and became effective on March 1, 1974. Cash flow projections are based



- 12 -
on the new tariffs and a further adjustment in 1976. TELCO has agreed to
seek a rate of return on net fixed assets of not less than 8.5% annually from
1974 onwards (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.04).
39.        The government has agreed to submit to Parliament for its approval
a proposal to modify the Telephone Act of 1968 (draft Guarantee Agreement,
Section 3.05). The Act now allows rates to be set so as to enable the
company to earn a return of between 7 and 8.5%, or at least 2.25 times the
annual interest payable. The Act, however, has the following main deficiencies:
(i) with low indebtedness, rates designed to give a 7 - 8.5% return could
result in inadequate internal cash generation; and (ii) automatic review of rates
is not prescribed, and the rate of return could fall below that prescribed in
the Act. Since the Act was originally passed, the ownership of the company has
changed and interest rates have generally gone up.  It is necessary that the
Act be updated to take these changes intc account. It should be simplified by
eliminating the dual earnings limit of either a rate of return or interest
coverage, and the revision should permit a rate of return of at least 8.5%.
The government has agreed to seek a revision of the Act by mid-1976.
Justification
40.        With the proposed investment, reorganization, and introduction of
effective operational controls and tariffs, TELCO will once more become a
viable operation. The provision of rapid and reliable telecommunications is
essential for the efficient organization of the flow of production inputs
and for the distribution and marketing of goods. The project will make an
important contribution to the economic development of Trinidad and Tobago
by increasing the operational efficiency in administrative, industrial, and
commercial activities. The project will remDve congestion of tae local and
long distance network, imnprove quality of service, and partly meet the demand
for new telephone connections.
41.        The rate of return is 15.4% if benefits are measured by incremental
revenue attributable to the project and financial costs are adjusted for
taxes and duties. Furthermore, the incremental revenue undoubtedly understates
the economic benefits the consumers will receive from the project. A sensiti-
vity analysis has been carried out, showing that the rate of return is between
17.5% and 11.4% for variations of the main parameters of 10%.
42.        The fiscal impact of TELCOts operations on governmenl; revenues
will be favorable. During 1974-77, additional taxes and proceeds of the
guarantee fee accruing to the government are projected at about TT$9 million
and customs duties at about TT$lO million. After the construction period,
with TELCO's improved profitability, the fiscal impact is expected to be
even more favorable.



- 13 -
43.        Bank participation in this project is justified for a number of
reasons, including the lower prices of equipment resulting from the Bank's
competitive bidding procedures, and a substantial improvement in TELCO's
operating and financial situation brought about by the Bank's association and
technical assistance. The procedures of international competitive bidding
may result in savings up to 3C% ae compared with the alternative of resorting
to supplier credits. The reorganization of the Pbrt-of-Spain telecommunications
maintenance set-up, the introduction of an effective budgetary system and
control procedures, the rescheduling of the company's short term debt, and
the application to the PUC for a rate increase are institutional improvements
already initiated as a result of the Bank's advice. Fvrther Bank assistance
will be required for the modification of the Telephone Act of 1968 prior to
mid-1976. Finally, the financing plan for TELCO's rehabilitation and expansion
program includes a bond-issue to be placed in the local market. The Bank
has been instrumental in promoting the proposed issue, which would be the
first of a non-governmental institution in Trinidad and Tobago.
PART V. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHaRITY
44.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Trinidad and Tobago
Telephone Company Limited, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Trinidad
and Tobago and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
45.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
46.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUOTIO-
Loan 497-TR - Highways; US$8.6 miillion Loan of June 12, 1967; Cl Ming_Date:
Septeiber 30, 1975
The first construction stage of the four-lane expressway-comprising
all earthworks and structures but paving only of the northbound 'Lanes - was
completed in 1972, and the ncrthbound lanes opened to traffic. Hlowever,
there has been some deterioration of the asphaltic wearing course and it
may be required to apply a sealcoat as protection against further deterior-
ation. A contract for the second construction stage - paving of the south-
bound lanes - was awarded in September 1973, and completion is soheduled for
late 197h. Total project costs are now estimated at about $21 MLllion,
representing a cost overrun of about $4 million compared to the appraisal
estimates (to a significant extent a reflection of price escalat-'on due to
delayed construction). However, benElfits deriving from the project have
also increased considerably (due to higher traffic than projected and the
effect of price inflation of the benefits), and the economic retutrn on the
expressway construction has not decreased in relation to the appraisal
estimate (11% on vehicle operating costs savitgs, 13.5% if time s avings are
included  and 15% if time savings and accident reduction savings are
included5.
Loan 564-TR - Education; USt9.4 million Loan of October 16, 1968; Closig Date:
June 30, 1975
There was an initial delay of about sevsn months due to difficulties
in the selection of architectural consultants, and further delays in construction
resulting from labor and site problems and adverse weather condi tions. Project
implementation is now 18 months behind schedule, but progressing satisfactorily
and completion is expected by about September 1974. Sixteen project schools
were completed and occupied for the beginning of school year 1973-74;
educational objectives are being fulailled. Project cost overruws are
estimated at about $1 .4 million or 7% of the total (mainly due t) increasing
construction costs); these cost overruns Will be met by the government.
Loan 862-TR - Second Education; US$9.3 million Lan of October 2!5, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The Loan Agreement became effective on February 15, 1973, and project
implementation is, except for initial delays in the technical assistance
component, progressing satisfactorily. Consultant architects have been
engaged, design studies are being carried out, and sites are bei.ng acquired.
1/  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weiknesses in
project execution.

CID A and ODA have agreed to provide technical experts and fellowships
needed for the San Fernando Technical Institute and the National Training
Board, and the first experts are now expected shortly.
Loan 743-TR - Population; US$3.0 million Loan of May 28, 1971; Closing gate:
June 30, 197
On both the construction and the technical assistance side, the
project is now progressing adequately. However, because of the initial
delays, the project is far behind schedule. A major reason for the delay
has been the difficulty in obtaining suitable sites. The construction of
the health center at Toco started in September 1973 and should be completed
by June 1974. Contracts for two other health units have been awarded
and work on all units is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1974.
The Nurses Training School, Maternity Hospital, and Family Planning Institute
are scheduled for completion prior to January 1976. On the technical
assistance side, the evaluation advisor arrived towards the end of 1972,
and the firm of Peat, Marvick, Mitchell and Co. was contracted by the govern-
ment in November 1973 to carry out the management and manpower utilization
studies.  The fact-finding, analysis, and presentation of broad recommendations
arising from these studies was substantially completed by March 1974 and the
preparation of the final recommendations and the implementation program by
April. Efforts for the recruitment of two advisors for family life education
and a nursing advisor are being made by the government. Mainly as a result
of delays, construction costs have risen rapidly (35% in 1973 alone), and
total costs of the project, originally estiwated at $4.5 million, are now
projected at $7.5 million. On the positive side, the number of new acceptors
under the family planning program has increased substantially from 1972 to 1973.
Loan 819-TR - Development Finance Company; US$2.0 million Loan of May 15, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Information on this loan is given in the main text of this report.
Loan 888-TR - Caroni Sugar; US$12.0 million Loan of April 18, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 19781
Progress on the mechanization of the company's field operations and
rehabilitation of the company's plant is proceeding as envisaged, but
delays have been experienced in contracting the consultants required to
carry out: (a) a hydrological/irrigation survey of North Caroni, (b) a
study of all aspects of Caroni operations, including field and factory
operations, cost control and management procedures, and (c) a study of the
possibilities and implications of subdividing the hilly company-owned lands
in the South for occupation by small-scale cane farmers. These studies have
recently commenced. The company has suffered badly from a series of mishaps,
including exceptionally heavy rains in 1972, the worst drought in 50 years
in 1973, and acute labor troubles in 1974. Wihereas normal production is
around 200,000 tons of sugar a year, the 1973 crop was only 170,000 tons
and the 1974 crop will probably be in the order of 140,000 tons. The
financial impact, however, will be mitigated to a considerable extent by
the much higher sugar prices.
