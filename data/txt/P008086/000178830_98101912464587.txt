APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLIJSIONS
(i)       This report appraises a project for the expansion and rehabilitation
of the telephone network in Trinidad and Tobago for which a Bank loan of
US$18 million equivalent is proposed. The Trinidad and Tobago Telephone
Companv Limited (TELCO) the proposed borrower which is responsible for tele-
phone service in Trinidad and Tobago has been unable to meet the fast growth
of demand for telephone services. This has put a heavy strain on the present
limited and inadequate facilities resulting in poor service. The situation
has deteriorated more rapidly in the last two years due to a very tight finan-
cial situation. As a result, new service can only be given beginning in 1976
when the eqtuipment in the proposed project becomes operational.
(ii)      The project which forms part of TELCO's 1973-1977 development
program, consists of the installation of 26,000 lines of switching equipment;
cables, and subscriber apparatus to add about 17,000 new subscribers; and
expansion of long distance equipment to remove congestion and to improve qua-
lity of services. The project is estimated to cost TT$60.9 million (US$30.5
million) with a foreign exchange component of TT$36 million (US$18.0 million).
The proposed Bank loan would fully cover the foreign exchange component includ-
ing interest during construction of US$1.8 million. This would be the first
Bank loan for telecommunications in Trinidad and Tobago.
(iii)     TELCO is a limited liability company, incorporated under the Com-
panies Ordinances and it operates as a commercial corporation, paying taxes
on profits and customs duties on imported equipment. The Government fully
owns TE:LCO and appoints its Board of Directors.  TELCO's organization is
satisfactory and the management competent. Improvement of certain operating
proceduires and strengthening of the financial control will be carried out
by management during the project period.
(iv)      All procurement under the project would be by international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines on procurement.
(v)       TELCO's financial situation was fairly satisfactory up to 1971/72
when it started to deteriorate rapidly. TELCO therefore proposed new tariffs
to the Public Utilities Commission (PIJC) which approved them with effect.from
March 1, 1974.  With the new tariffs and a further adjustment in 1976, necessary
if productivity increases do not materialize, the return on net fixed assets
in operation is expected to become satisfactory and the financial situation
to improve steadily.



- ii -
(vi)      The basic justification of the project is to strengthen TELCO's or-
ganization and improve its financial position, and to support business, trade,
industry and administration. The rate of return on the project is estimated
at about 15.4%.
(vii)     The project is suitable for a Bank Loan of US$18 million equivalent
for a term of 20 years including a grace period of 4 years. The Guarantor
would be Trinidad and Tobago.

APPRAISAL OF A TELECONl4UNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has requested Bank assistance
in the financing of a telecommunications project to extend and improve exist-
ing facilities. This would be the Bank's first lending operation for tele-
communications in that country.
1.09      The proposed borrower would be the Trinidad and Tobago Telephone
Company Limited (TELCO), a Government-owned Corporation responsible for all
national telephone and telex services.
1.0,      The project which would be undertaken during FY 1974-77, forms
part of TELCO's five-year (1973-77) telecommunications development program.
The project provides for the installation of about 26,000 local automatic
exchange lines; 3,000 long distance exchange lines; and for the expansion
of the lon,- distance network.
1.n14     In Januarv-February 1973, a Bank mission visited Trinidad and
rrobago to review TELCO's development program. Following discussions during
tlhat visit, TELCO revised the program by deferring equipment retirement, and
prepared a new financing plan.
1.05      This report is based on information obtained from TELCO, and on
the findings of a mission composed of Messrs. M. DeLima, B. Holmgren and
J. Nikkila which visited Trinidad and Tobago in June, 1973, followed by an
updating mission composed of Messrs. M. DeLima and B. Holmgren ill March 1974.
2.  THE ECONOMY AND TELECOINMTICATIONS SECTOR
The Economy
2.01      Trinidad and Tobago has an area of 1,980 square miles and is
situiated in the Caribbean. It comprises two main islands - Trinidad and
Tobago - and s-veral small islands. Trinidad is the most southerly of the
West Indian Islands. Tobago lies to the north-east of Trinidad - the two
islan(Is being separated by a 21-mile wide channel. The country's population
totals  bIhouit one million, of whichi 390,000 live in the Port-of-Spain area in
Trinidlaid.  Port-of-Spain is the main harbor, and commercial and administra-
tive center of the country. San Fernando and Point Fortin (in the south of
Trinidad), Arima (in the east of Trinidad), and Scarborough (in Tobago), are
the other important towns.



2.02      The 1971 gross national product was US$970 million.  The annual
per capita income was US$940. The economy is based principally on petroleum
products, agriculture (mainly sugar, coffee, cocoa and citrus) and fertilizers.
The major 1972 exports were fuels and lubricants (US$416 million); agricultural
commodities (USS35 million); and chemicals and asphalt (US$28 million).
2.03      Because of the important role of exports in the country's economy,
rapid and reliable telecommunications services are essential for providing a
means of exchanging information between producers and exporters, and with
foreign traders. Good telecommunications facilities are also e2:tremely im-
portant for efficient administration of the country and for improving trans-
portation and distribution of goods within the country.  The project aims at
extending and improving such services.
The Telecommunications Sector
2.04      TELCO is responsible for all national telephone and telex services.
The Trinidad and Tobago External Telecommunications Company Limited (TEXTEL)
is responsible for the national telegraph services, maritime services, and
for international telecommunications facilities. TEXTEL is jointly owned by
Covernment (51%) and Cable and Wireless Limited U.K. (49%). The military and
civil aviation authorities have established some telecommunications facilities
for their special operational needs. When TELCO is unable to provide suitable
long distance circuits to private users, the Government, after consulting
with TELCO, issues licenses on an annual basis to set up and operate circuits.
While only minor savings could be achieved in engineering and operating costs
due to the fact that the plant operated by TEXTEL is clearly separate and
technically different from that operated by TELCO, some savings in general
administration could still result from a merger of the two entities. However,
since the first priority is to restore TELCO's financial viability and to
carry out the overdue development program, a merger of TELCO and TEXTEL should
only be considered after these objectives have been achieved.
2.05      TELCO is a limited liability company, incorporated under the Com-
panies Ordinances. Act No. 7 of 1968 (The Telephone Act), passed by the
Trinidad an(d Tobago Parlirment, provides for the vesting of the telephone
system of Trinidad and Tobago and for its future operation and regulation.
TlLCO operates as a commercial corporation and pays taxes on profits, and
customs duties on imported equipment. TELCO was omned equally by Continental
Telephone Corporation (CTC) and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago until
November 1972 when the Government purchased the stock held by CTC. TELCO
has the exclusive right to provide a telephone service for the public use.
While TELCO can make proposals for tariff changes in accordance with criteria
set out in the Telephone Act, the Public TJtilities Commission, which is a
quasi-judicial body, is responsible for approving all such changes.



-3-
Existing Facilities
2.06      The telephone density in Trinidad and Tobago as of January 1, 1974,
was 6.6 telephones per 100 persons which is relatively high for a developing
country. Annex 1 sets out statistical information on telephones in various
countries of the world. The existing exchanges and long distance network 4n
Trinidad and Tobago are currently inadequate in quantity, quality and relia-
bility to meet the country's development needs (see paragraph 2.11). Existing
facilities are shown on the attached map; basic network data are set out in
Annex 2.
(a)       Local Telephone Service
2.07      As of December 31, 1973, 31 local automatic and 3 small manual
exchanges were in operation, with a total installed capacity of 50,716 lines
and 41,524 connected lines (only 36 of these were provided from manual ex-
changes). Annex 3 gives a list of exchanges, their capacity, the number of
connected lines, as of December 31, 1973. The exchange fill at the end of
1973 was 82%. Because of very heavy traffic, TELCO will not be able to in-
crease the fill and fally utilize the available capacity which was designed
for normal traffic and hence no increase in connections is foreseen till
1976, when additional equipment would begin to be commissioned under the
(1973-77) development program. Annex 4 gives data on exchange capacity,
number of connected lines and number of telephones during 1968-73.
(b)       Long Distance Service
2.08      Long distance services are provided by VHF radio systems, micro-
wave systems, open wire carriers and voice frequency (VF) cables (see map).
Facilities for subscribers' dialing of long distance calls are available for
about 99% of the subscribers.
(c)       Telegram and Telex Service
2.09      There are only three telegraph offices in the country; at Scar-
borough in Tobago, and Port-of-Spain and San Fernando in Trinidad. TEXTEL
provides the service over radio circuits. Message transmission to other
places in the country is thereafter completed by using motor transport. In
Port-of-Spain TELCO operates a telex system of 200 lines capacity with 153
subscribers.
(d)       International Facilities
2.10      Trinidad and Tobago has good international communications to coun-
tries in the Caribbean, U.S., Canada, U.K. and Venezuela. TEXTEL provides
these services through the earth satellite station to U.S., U.K. and Canada;
via t ropospheric scatter systems (a) to Barbados and thence to the West
Indian Islands, and (b) to Guyana for circuits to Guyana and Surinam; and
via VHF radio systems to Grenada and Venezuela. Seventy-four international
telephone circuits - 69 of these worked from June, 1973 on a semi-automatic
basis - handle an average daily traffic of about 800 international calls.



-4-
(e)       Quality of Service
2.11      Lack of continuous and proper planning in the past has caused the
telephone network to have a number of deficiencies which in turn have led to
poor service. There is a large unfilled demand (in January 1974 the waiting
list contained about 22,000 applications); congestion on local and long distance
service; an(d high fault incidence with extended outages in the local telephone
system. Congestion in the local service is partly due to the flat rate tariff
which encourages a large number of frivolous calls resulting in high traffic
beyond the handling capacity of the system.  Congestion is further increased
due to subscribers making repeated attempts to call others who are themselves
engaged on calls. The number of originated calls is expected to reduce with
the proposed introduction during the project period of the message-rate tariff
(see paragraph 5.13) relieving congestion and improving service. Congestion
on long distance facilities is due to traffic being much greater than can be
handled by existing circuit capacity and the unsatisfactory quality of circuits.
The project aims to remove congestion by providing about 1,400 additional long
distance circuits and to improve quality by using microwave equipment on all
routes. High fault incidence on outdoor plant is caused by the unsatisfactory
condition of cables and drop wires. Extended outages are due to fault clearance
methocds.  With the introduction of better fault control procedures coupled with
replacement of unreliable outdoor plant during the program period, outdoor plant
maintenance is expected to provide a marked improvement.
3. THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
'Tle Program
3.01      TELCO has drawn up a five-7ear (1973-77) telecommunications devel-
opment progrmm.  It consists of the following main items:
(a)  relhabilitation of local distribution cables;
(h)  minor reconstruction works; and facilities for metering
of local calls in all exchanges;
(c)  installation of a microwave link between San Fernando, and
La Brea/Point Fortin; and
(d)  the project proposed for Bank financing described below
(paragraph 3.03).
3.02      The program's direct cost is estimated at TT$71.2 million (US$35.6
million) including a foreign exchange component of US$20.2 million equivalent.
D)etails of the cost of the program are given in Annex 5 and the physical
content of the program and project with completion dates of each item is given
in Annex 6. The equipment capacities of each of the automatic local exchanges
broken down yearwise during the 1973-77 development period are set out in
Annex 7.



The Project
3.03      The Project would be carried out during the four-year period
(1974-77) and forms part of TELCO's five-year (1973-77) telecommunications
development program. It consists of the following:
(a) installation of about 26,000 lines of new local automatic
exchange equipment, including replacement of about 11,000
lines of automatic exchange equipment; and reuse of about
8,000 of the replaced lines of local automatic exchange
equipment as additions to existing equipment;
(b) installation of local distribution, and inter-office cables,
and subscribers equipment, to connect a total of 17,000
additional subscribers (12,000 up to 1977, and 5,000
in 1978);
(c)  installation of microwave radio terminals and multiplex
equipment to provide about 1,400 additional long distance
circuits;
(d) installation of a long distance automatic exchange with
about 3,000 long distance circuits; and
(e) acquisition of land and construction of buildings for
housing equipment.
The cost of the project is estimated at TT$60.9 million (US$30.5 million)
with a foreign exchange component of US$18.0 million equivalent. A summary of
the costs is given below.

3.05      The foreign cost estimates are based on recent price quotations
obtained bv TELCO from various mitnufacturers and on average prices, adjusted
for recent currency parity changes, obtained on international competitive
bids under Bank loans. The local cost estimates include customs duties
at 25% ad valorem on all imnorted goods 1/. The estimates are reasonable.
1/   Customs duties on telecommunications equipment are at present levied at
25% and 15% ad valorem when imported from non-commonwealth and commonwealth
group countries. No import duties are levied for goods obtained from
countries in the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM). However, the portion
of goods to be obtained from CARTCOM countries for the purposes of the
Bank project is likely to be negligible and would not affect the estimates
of customs duties.



-.7-
Contingencies
3.06      Telecommunications development is a continuous process that occurs
through the installation and augmentation of plant at thousands of locations
in any program year. While some works will cost more, due for example, to
striking rock beds or other adverse conditions when laying cable, there will
be others where conditions will result in less than average costs. Because of
this wide spread in costs, plus the variety of telecommunications works, the
overall risk of a cost overrun due to physical contingencies is small; in
any case, it would result in only a slight rephasing and retiming of target
objectives. Therefore, no provision for physical contingencies is included
in the project.
3.07      Foreign costs include a contingency of US$2.5 million to cover
possible 18% increase in estimated prices of imported goods. Local price
contingencies of US$2.0 million (about 20% of total local costs) have been
provided to cover uncertainties during the construction period in the wages
of construction staff and cost of locally procured materials.

3.08      The schedule for execution of the project, set out in Annex 8, is
realistic. TELCO's staff will do engineering designs; prepare bid documents
and technical specifications; and evaluate bids. TELCO will lay, joint and
commission all distribution and inter-office cables; and will supervise con-
struction of cable ducts by local contractors. TELCO will provide installation
staff to work under the contractors supervision for the installation of switch-
ing and long distance transmission equipment. TELCO will also carry out
acceptance tests of all installed equipment.
Procurement
3.09      All goods provided under the project for Bank financing would be
procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines. Private branch exchanges are presently assembled locally
and may be partly manufactured during the project period. Locally manufactured
goods will have a protection of 15% of the C.I.F. price or the actual tariff,
whichever is the lower. Similarly, goods obtained from CARICOM countries
will be protected by 15% or the difference in tariffs (non-CARICOM-CARICOM),
whichever is lower.
Disbursements
3.10      Annex 9 gives the estimated loan disbursements during FY 1975-77.
Disbursement would be for the C.I.F. costs of imported equipment, the foreign
costs of its installation, and the ex-factory costs (less local taxes) of any
locally awarded contracts for goods specified under the loan and interest and
other charges during construction up to January 31, 1977. As the project as
designed does not meet all the estimated demand, any unused balance of the
loan should be used to finance additional equipment, similar to that already
procured under the loan, after consultation with the Bank.

4. JUSTIFICATION
4.01      The basic justification for the project is to support Trinidad and
Tobago's development objectives by providing an essential service for the
country's agriculture, business, trade and industry. Rapid and reliable
communications are important for the efficient organization of the flow of
inputs for production, and for the distribution and marketing of agricultural
and industrial goods. The Government also intends to disperse and develop
commercial and industrial centers outside Port-of-Spain for which good local
and long distance facilities would be essential.
4.02      Trinidad and Tobago is currently under-supplied with telecommuni-
cztions services in that the local and long distance network is congested,
the quality of service is unsatisfactory, and there is a large unfilled
expressed demand for telephones (see paragraph 2.11) in the whole country.
The project aims to improve the quality of service to existing subscribers
essentially by providing an adequate number of high quality circuits and by
rehabilitating damaged cable plant; and meeting part of the demand for tele-
phones (see 4.03 below). It is not at present possible to meet all telephone
demands by installing more equipment because of financial constraints.
Market Demand
(a)       Local Facilities
4.03      The current demand (January 1, 1974) totals about 64,000 - about
42,000 existing subscriber lines and about 22,000 applicants on the waiting
list. This does not, however, include latert demands, i.e., people who have
not applied because of long delays in obtaining telephones. TELCO's historic
growth rate of connected lines has been about 8% per year. The total forecast
demand on this basis would be about 92,000 by 1978. TELCO's development pro-
gram is modest and aims to provide only 12,000 additional connections up to
1977 and 17,000 connections up to 1978 - a growth rate equivalent of 6% per
year in connected lines during the program period 1973-77. The proposed
expansion program will thus provide in 1978 only for the applicants now on
the waiting list. Apart from financial constraints in planning a larger
expansion during this period, earlier relief is not possible because exchanges
are working to full capacity now, and additional connections would only be
provided in the last two years of the project period when the project equip-
ment would be commissioned. The estimates made for the next development
program beginning in 1978 for which advance payments would be made already
in 1977 are naturally tentative. In order to make possible continued and
more rapid improvements in telecommunications service after 1977, the timing
of the next program will be carefully considered and it may prove to be
feasible to start it somewhat earlier than indicated by present tentative
estimates. In view of the long waiting list for connections, forecast of
the growth rate of connections is unlikely to be significantly affected by
the tariff increase. Annex 10 sets out the demand forecast at TELCO's



- 9 -
historic connection growth rates of 8% per year, the equipped capacity, and
the connected lines, between 1966-78. It will be noted that the unfilled
demand at the end of the Bank financed project (1974-77) would be larger than
that at the start of the project period.
(b)       Long Distance Facilities
4.04      The country's present long distance facilities are inadequate and
congested. The quality is generally unsatisfactory, except on one route with
microwave equipment between Port-of-Spain and San Fernando. TELCO has worked
out separately for each route the future circuit requirements needed to re-
move existing congestion and to meet the increased traffic from existing and
new connections provided during the project period, and taking into account
the expected increase in traffic arising from improvement in quality and re-
liability of service during the project period. The growth forecasts are in
line with experience in other developing countries with similar tariffs and
ate realistic. The project is designed to provide an additional 1,400 high
quality long distance circuits - an average annual growth of 12% - which is
reasonable.
Least Cost Solution
4.05      In late 1960, TELCO after completing a detailed study of future
telecommunications requirements, decided on (a) national numbering, switching
and transmission plans; (b) choice of common control switching equipment; and
(c) choice and disposition of microwave systems for the long distance net-
work. These decisions are sound and provide the framework for the least
cost system development. The fundamental network plans have since been based
on the use of common control switching equipment and the first common control
exchange of 3,000 lines capacity was installed in 1969. In continuance of
this policy, common control exchanges will be installed under the project.
Cable routes will be designed according to standard plant practices which
are based on economic period provision for primary, secondary and distribu-
tion cables, and provide the least cost solution. TELCO recently carried
out a study to review the choice of microwave vs coaxial cable systems for
long distance routes and confirmed its earlier decision to use the more eco-
nomical microwave systems.
Rate of Return
4.06      The rate of return is 15.4% (Annex 11), if benefits are measured by
incremental revenue attributable to the project and financial costs are adjusted
for taxes and duties. However the incremental revenue understates the benefits
consumers receive from the project. A sensitivity analysis (paragraph 7 of
Annex 11) has been carried out, showing that the rate of return is between
17.5% and 11.4% for variations of the main parameters of 10%. This rate of
return is a minimum estimate of the internal economic rate of return.

5. THE BORROWER
5.01      The Trinidad and Tobago Telephone Company (TELCO) would be the
borrower of the proposed loan; its role in the sector is given in paragraphs
2.04 and 2.05.
Organization
5.02      TELCO is managed by a seven-member Board of Directors appointed by
the Government. An organizational chart is shown in Annex 12. The day-to-
day management of the company is entrusted to a General Manager. He is
assisted by four departmental heads - Deputy General Manager (who also acts
as the Secretary to the Board) responsible for security, training and ancil-
lary services; Chief Engineer for transmission planning; Controller for finance;
and Assistant General Manager for Plant Operations. In addition, an Assistant
Giineral Manager for Engineering acts as an adviser to the General Manager and
the Chief Engineer on general management and does switching planning. When
the present adviser retires in mid 1975, the switching planning will be trans-
ferred to the Chief Engineer. This organizational set-up is similar to that
of many other telecommunications entities and is satisfactory.
5.03      For telecormunications operations, the country is divided into three
districts (Port-of-Spain, San Fernando and Tobago) each under a District
Manager.  The District Managers of San Fernando and Tobago are responsible for
the maintenance and operations of all plants (except long distance) within
their districts. In Port-of-Spain, however, the maintenance of outdoor plant
is the responsibility of the District Manager; the maintenance of central
office equipment that of the Central Office Manager; and the maintenance of
PBX equipment that of the Business Systems Manager. The District Manager
and the Central Office Manager report to the Assistant General Manager for
Plant Operations, whereas the Business Systems Manager reports to the Chief
Engineer for planning. The arrangement is nnsatisfactory, with no single
authority with overall responsibility for plant maintenance resulting in an
uncoordinated maintenance approach and poor service. TELCO has worked out a
proposal for the reorganization of the Port-of-Spain maintenance set-up to
ensure clear-cut unified maintenance responsibility. This proposal which was
discussed during loan negotiations and found satisfactory, will be made
effective from July 1, 1974.
Staff
5.04      The senior engineering and financial staff are well qualified,
experienced and capable of managing the present assets and those to be added
under the project. The technical staff in central offices are likewise
capable and competent. The outdoor staff, however, are not competent enough
and need further training (see paragraph 5.08).



- 11 -
5.05      TELCO's staff totals about 1,700, giving a staff ratio of about
26 per thousand telephones. The staff utilization, particularly on plant
maintenance, should be improved. TELCO has already taken steps to Feorganize
fault clearance procedures with expected higher productivity. As a conse-
quence, TELCO should be able to handle all installations to the end of the
project period with the number of staff as now existing, except for some
additional switching and transmission technical staff. When these measures
are implemented, the staff ratio would be reduced to 21 per thousand tele-
phones, which is reasonable. TELCO agreed during negotiations that until
the completion of the project it shall not increase its staffing above the
existing level with the exception of some additional senior staff and some
technical staff for maintenance of project installed common control switching
and long distance transmission equipment.
5.C.6     Annex 13 gives details of number of employees in each department,
withi their pav scales and service conditions. The pay scales are coimensurate
with the duties, and the salaries are comparable, or slightly higher in some
cases, with those paid for similar duties and qualifications by other organiza-
tions. Tturn-over of staff is generally negligible except for telephonists who
are easily replaced.
1'ecruitment and Training
5.07      TELCO is able to recruit an adequate number of engineers and tech-
nicians from the local technical institutes. Likewise no difficulty is ex-
perienced in recruitment of non-technical staff with the required qualifications.
5.08      Graduate engineers are trained in Barbados and U.S.A. while other
categories of staff are trained at TELCOts training center in Port-of-Spain.
Thlie center imparts instructions - theoretical and practical - in the opera-
tions and maintenance of the type of equipment currently used by TELCO.
During the year ending December 31, 1973, the center trained 250 staff of
various categories. TELCO has now decided to run refresher courses for
existine outdoor plant staff to broaden their capabilities to fit in with
newqlv developed maintenance procedures. The training arrangements are
adequate.
Accounts and Audit
5.09      TELCO has a generally satisfactory accounting system.  Financial
statenients are preparedl monthly and are available within one month of the
close of the period. The annual financial statements which are audited by
Price Waterhouse and Co. are generally available within three months of the
end of the fiscal year. The introduction of an effective budgetary system
and control procedures are being considered by a staff committee which is
reviewing the present arrangements. TELCO agreed during negotiations to an
effective timetable for the implementation of budgetary system to be opera-
tional from January 1, 1975.



- 12 -
Billing and Collection
5.10       TELCO's billing system, which was recently installed with the assis-
tance of the Continental Telephone Company (U.S.) is satisfactory. Collection
is also satisfactory except for Government accounts which due to Government
payment procedures, are settled on the average one month later than for other
subscribers.
Tariffs
5.11       The Telephone Act of 1968 allows rates to be set so as to enable a
return of between 7 and 8.5% (both "return" and "rate base" definitions differ
slightly from Bank definitions) or at least 2.25 times the annual interest
payable. These provisions have the following deficiencies: (a) with high
indebtedness excessive rates could be introduced since rates could be set on
2.25 times annual interest payable basis; (b) with low indebtedness the rates
might be set onl]y on a 7 - 8.5% return basis which could result in inadequate
internal cash generation; and (c) automatic review of rates is not prescribed
and the rate of return could be allowed to fall below that prescribed in the
Act. Since the Act was originally passed, the situation of the company has
chaaged from one of half private-foreign and half Government ownership to
comrilete Government ownership. For these reasons and the fact that inter-
est rates have generally increased, the Act should be updated to take these
changed circtumstances into account by elimination of the interest coverage
criteria and by revision of the minimum allowable rate of return to provide
for at least 8.57.  This change is not urgent since during the project period,
the governing test for tariff revisions will be the interest coverage, and
this test, if applied, will provide more revenue than required under the
financing plan. Accordingly, the Bank reached an understanding with the
novernmient of Trinidad and Tobago during negotiations that the Act should
be modifiedi suitably by mid-1976 and that the Bank would be allowed to comment
on the propose(1 modifications before enactment.
5.12      Since TELCO's tariffs were inadequate to generate a reasonable rate
of return an(d to providc funds necessary to meet the requirements of the
fi.nancino plani for the proposed Bank project, a new tariff designed to
increase overall revenue by 607 was approved in February 1974 by the Public
UTtilities Comrission (PIJC) according to procedures and criteria set out in
the Telephone Act of 1968.  TIhe new tariffs set out in Annex 14 were intro-
ducecl on MIarch 1, 1974.
5.13      The tariff structure is deficient in that local calls are free
which contributes to the present overloading of the local systems. Although
the tariff proposed bv TELCO inclurled a chlarge for local calls, the PUC
declined to consider TEILCO's request for local call charging on procedural
groundIs.  TELCO has acgreed to seek the restructuring of its tariffs including
metering of local calls by June 30, 1976.

normal hazards in accordance with practice in the telecommunications industry.
6. FINANCES
Background
6.01      TELCO's financial situation was fairly satisfactory up to 1971/72
with rates of return of about 7% when it started to deteriorate rapidly. The
net income after interest payment of TT$1.3 million in 1971 was turned into a
small loss in 1972; in 1973 the loss was about TT$2.3 million. There are
several reasons for this change: a rapid increase in salary expense; a
stagnation of the growth of the network; and a much needed rate increase was
not obtained. Another contributing factor is the rapid increase in deprecia-
tion expense resulting from the steep increase in the unit cost of plant added
due to imposition of customs duties and devaluation of the TT dollar. The
financial position had also deteriorated due to inadequate earnings and the
assumption of large amounts of short-term debt to finance plant additions.
IHowever, with the recent rate increase and improved productivity made possi-
ble by network growth, the financial results are projected to be i:atisfactory
from 1974. Due to heavy debt service, only 25% of program requirements are
expected to come from TELCO's own resources.
Past Earnings
6.02      Income statements are in Annex 15.  Between 1969 and 1973, TELCO's
operating revenues increased by about 11% per annum of which about 8% per
annum was due to increased subscribers and about 3% per annum to increased
average revenue per subscriber. On the other hand, total operating expenses
increased by 19% per annum due to significant wage increases and due to rapid
increases in depreciation expenses; during this period gross value of plant in
service doubled while installed capacity increased only by about 20% and num-
ber of subscribers by about 40%. The high cost of plant added after 1968 is
partly explained by the fact that customs duties (25%) had to be paid from
that date and a devaluation of the TT$ in 1967 by 17%. As a result, net oper-
ating income remained virtually unchanged up to 1973 when it fell by 60%,
and with the rapid increase in fixed assets in operation the rate of return
decreased from 7.1% to 2.0%. Rapidly increasing interest expenses turned a
net income of TT$1.9 million after interest payments in 1969 into a loss of
TT$2.3 million in 1973. Some operating characteristics are summarized below.

Present Financial Position
6.03      Balance sheets are in Annex 16.  TELCO's financial position as of
December 31, 1973, is summarized below.

Total Liabilities       50.6          25.3                100
6.04      The present gross value of plant includes an upward revaluation in
rlay 1968 by about 10% of the net assets at that time.  The gross value of
plant in service at December 31, 1973, is high largely due to the steep in-
crease in the value of assets added since 1968.  The composite depreciation
rate of about 4.5%y is reasonable and,in line with experience elsewhere.
The accumulated depreciation provision, which is only 20% of gross value of
plant in service, appears reasonable since over 50% of the plant (in value
terms) was added during the past four years.
6.05      The weak current position results from a substantial amount of cur-
rent liabilities and short term debt. Accounts payable is high due to a dis-
pute with TlN.TFT. over the revenue sharing arrangements for international tele-
phone calls. TFTLCO has heen withholding revenues collected from this service,
wvhiclh had accumulated to about TT$8 million. A new revenue sharing agreement
has now been reached with TEXTEL together with an agreement on the repayment
of the amount due over ten years including two years of grace. A considerable
amount of short-term debt was refinanced during 1972, and the remaining short
term debt still owed local banks will be converted into a TT$12 million loan
repayable over seven years including two years of grace.
6.06      Equity consists of share capital of TT$20.5 million and accumulated
earnings of TT$2.7 million. Long term debt consists of two loans from Exim
Bank totalling the equivalent of TT$6.2 million, repayable over six years at



- 15 -
about 5.5% interest and one loan from Continental Trading and Finance Corpor-
ation (CTIFC) of the equivalent of TT$21.2 million repayable over ten years
at 9.5% interest. The loan from CTIFC was refinanced in early 1974 and is
now repayable over 15 years including three years of grace.

6.08      The funds available from operations are projected to be TT$55.3
million based on (a) the present tariffs with an adjustment in 1976 (paragraph
6.14): (b) the growth in number of subscribers visualized in the program; (c)
a growth in operating expenses which only allows for salary increases in line
with past experience. Dividend payments would not be feasible during the
construction period; hence during negotiations assurances were obtained that
payments of dividends during the construction period 1974-1977 will be made
only after the approval of the Bank.



- 16 -
6.09      Borrowings have been placed at a total of TT$62 million -- net of
refinancing of short term debt totalling TT$16.4 (para. 6.05) and of the
CTIFC loan (para. 6.06) -- consisting of: the proposed Bank loan of TT$36
million; local bond issues totalling TT$21 million; and some miscellaneous
borrowings of TT$5 million, of which TT$1.4 million is in respect of the
future project. The bond issue would be the first non-Governmental bond
issue on the market and would therefore help develop that market. The
Government agreed during negotiations to underwrite issue of bonds until
the completion of the project of up to TT$28 million.
6.10      New equity capital would be contr.buted by Government and the amount
would equal TELCO's payments of customs duties on imported goods during the
program period estimated at TT$9.9 million. Assurances that these funds will
be available as and when required were obtained during negotiations.
6.11      In view of the limitation imposed by the financing plan, TELCO
will obtain Bank agreement based on a revised financing plan before commit-
ting itself to any capital expenditure during the construction period not
required for the program, if the aggregate of such capital expenditure made
or to be made in any one fiscal year should exceed an amount equivalent to
US$0.5 million.

6.13      Operating revenue is expected to increase by an average of 19%
annually mainly due to the recent tariff increase and an increase in the
number of subscribers from 1976 onward. Operating expenses are projected
to increase by an average of 15% annually which covers wage increases based
on past experience, a rapid increase in income taxes resulting from improved
Profits, and other operating expenses arising out of expanded operations.

The operating ratio would decrease from 92% in 1973 to 72% in 1974 due to
the impact of the proposed tariff increase but would subsequently increase
to about 75% in 1980. With the new tariffs TELCO is expected to maintain
a satisfactory level of earnings through 1980.
6.14      The rate of return 1/ is expected to be about 10% in 1974; however,
with a new three year wage contract effective January 1975, which is ex-
pected to follow past patterns, i.e., a large increase in the first year
followed by more normal increases in subsequent years, the rate of return
would drop to about 8.4% in 1975 and then subsequently improve to exceed 9%
after 1977. Internal cash generation will be sufficient to meet the require-
ments of the financing plan for the project period. However, to meet the needs
of financing further expansion, the rate of return has to be maintained at not
lower than 8.5%. In the forecast income statement an increase in tariffs has
been assumed in 1976 to meet this requirement in 1976 but it is hoped that
this will be obviated by a tighter control on expenditures, especially of
steep increases in wages and salaries. To assure TELCO's viability, it was
agreed during negotiations that TELCO should maintain a minimum rate of re-
turn after taxes of 8.5%.
6.15      TELCO's financial position is expected to be satisfactory during
the construction period. The recent conversion of the rather considerable
amount of current liabilities (paragraph 6.09) into long-term debt increased
the debt equity ratio to about 64:36 but the debt has now a much more reasonable
average maturity. TELCO agreed during negotiations to obtain Bank approval
before assuming new long-term debt if the debt service coverage 2/ is less
than 1.5. To further assure sound financial practices, TELCO also agreed
during negotiations to limit short-term borrowings to 3% of long-term capi-
talization. Indicators which will help monitor TELCO's performance, are
given in Annex 19.
Fiscal Impact
6.16      The fiscal impact of TELCO's operations will be quite favorable.
During the 1974 - 1977 period, taxes accruing to Government are projected
to total TT$8.4 million, customs duties TT$9.9 million, and a guarantee fee
of 1% imposed by Government in respect of the proposed Bank loan TT$0.7
million. Since the Government will increase its equity in TELCO by an amount
equal to customs duties, the net actual transfer to Government is expected
to be TT$9.1 million. After the construction period, with the improved
profitability, the fiscal impact is expected to become even more favorable.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  the Government will underwrite the issue of bonds up to
TT$28 million (paragraph 6.09);
(b)  the Government will contribute new equity during the con-
struction period corresponding to customs duties payable
during that period (paragraph 6.10);
(c)  TELCO will obtain Bank agreement based on a revised financing
plan before committing itself to any capital expenditure not
required for the project if the aggregate of such capital
expenditure made or to be made in any one fiscal year should
exceed an amount equivalert to US$0.5 million (paragraph 6.11);
(d)  TELCO will maintain tariffs at a level adequate to assure
a minimum rate of return on average net assets of 8.5%
(paragraph 6.14);
(e)  TELCO will not incur short-term debt exceeding 3% of long-
term capitalization without the prior approval of the Bank
(paragraph 6.15).
7.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$18 million for a term of 20 years including four years of grace.

Rate of Return
Project Period
1.        The rate of return calculations are based on costs and revenues in
the 22-year period beginning in 1974 and ending in 1995. This corresponds
to an estimated average project life time of 20 years, commencing in 1976
when, on average, the equipment will be put into operation.
Revenues
2.        The revenue estimates are based on the present tariff.  The
number of subscriber connections made possible each year by the project has
been obtained from Annex 4. The average revenue from subscribers connected
under the project is assumed to be the same as for existing subscribers.
Costs
3.        Only a very limited amount of additional staff will be necessary
for the project. of operating expenses, 60% are for staff. The balance has
been apportioned based on average lines in service.
Capital Expenditure
4.        Project expenditures excluding contingencies and duties have been
obtained from Annex 5. The residual value of the project after 20 years
(i.e., in 1995) is estimated at TT$1.5 million which is mainly the copper
value of cables.
Costs and Revenue Streams
5.        The annual costs and revenues in TT$ attributable to the project
are summarized below:
(1)    (2)      (3)     (4)      (5)      (6)     (22)

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO TELEPHONE COMPANY LIMITED (TELCO)
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
A. Income Statements
Operating Revenues
1.        Rentals.  The new tariff is expected to generate an average revenue
of TT$380 per subscriber in 1974 --- an increase by 81% from TT$210. From 1979,
with a faster growth of residential subscribers, the average is expected to
start to decline slowly (one percent per annum). Number of subscribers through
1978 is projected for each year based on program works and, from 1979, a
growth rate of 8% has been assumed.
2.        Domestic Trunk.  Based on the proposed increase of the pulse rate
from TT$.05 to TT$.07.
3.        International.  The 1973 and 1974 figure reflects the new sharing
arrangement with TEXTEL which is expected to give TELCO 20% higher revenues.
In 1975, the increase is projected at 10% and in 1976 and onwards at 15%
annually.
4.        Other.  In 1976, an additional tariff increase of about 28% has
been assumed to offset the rapid increase in operating expenses resulting
from a projected rapid growth of Expenses (para 7 below).
5.       TMiscellaneous.  This item, which is expected to increase with the
increased revenues, is the estimated portion of operating revenues not
collectable and arising out of bills in dispute and not paid.
Operating Expenses
6.        Salaries and Other.  Based on the assumption of only a very small
increase in staff during the construction period and wage increases following
past patterns. The annual increases are as follows: 1975 - 25%; 1976 - 10%;
1977 - 10%.
7.        Depreciation.  TELCO calculates depreciation expenses using dif-
ferent percentages for each class of plant, i.e., telephone plant at 5%,
vehicles at 25%, tools at 15%, and land at 0%, which are applied on the
plant values at the beginning of the year. This method has been used for
the forecast.



ANNEX -18
Page 2
8.        Taxes.  Of taxable profits (i.e., after interest charged to opera-
tion), 50, is payable in taxes. To calculate profits, a wear and tear
allowance of 6%'. of gross plant in service is applied instead of depreciation.
Also, losses can be carried forward.
9.         Interest.  For details, see paragraph 21 of this annex.
B. Balance Sheets
10.       Fixed Assets.  Value of plant commissioned each year has been
estimated as follows (TT$ million): 1974 - 4; 1975 - 21; 1976 - 40;
1977 and on - 15.
I1.       Inventories.  The average annual increase is projected at 5% per
annum.
12.       Accounts Receivable.  Projected as 17% of revenues.
13.       Contributions.  These are new equity contributions by the Govern-
ment corresponding to customs duties payable during the construction period.
14.       Debt.  For details see paragraph 21 of this Annex.
15.       Accounts Payable.  The amount due to TEXTEL has been removed in
1974 as this liability is converted into a long term loan. Other accounts
payable are projected to increase with expanded operations.
C. Funds Flow Statement
16.       Internal Cash Generation - Other.  These are depreciation charged
to clearing accounts. In 1973, the proceeds from the sale of the Nelson
Exchange building is also included.
17.       Contribution to Equity.  (See paragraph 16).
18.       Futuire Program.  An annual growth rate of subscribers of 8%
heyinnino in 1978 would be equivalent to the connection of 26,148 sub-
scribers during, the period 1078 - 1982. At a fill factor of 80%, this
would call for switching, equipment of 32,700 lines.  With necessary replace-
ments, the reqtuirements of new switching equipment will be 47,000 lines. At
Us$700 per line ($600 for local and $100 for long distance) this would call
for investments of TT$66 million.
