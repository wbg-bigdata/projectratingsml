                         CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

                   THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
                         TRANSITIONAL SUPPORT CREDIT



Borrower            The People's Republic o f Bangladesh

Implementing Agency MinistryofFinance

Amount              SDR 121.5 million (US$200 million equivalent)

Terms               Standard IDA terms; 40-year maturity, including a 10-year grace period
                        ~


Tranching           A single tranche Credit of SDR 121.5 million (US$200 million equivalent)
                    would be made available upon credit effectiveness.

Description         The proposed Transitional Support Credit (TSC) would support the policy and
                    institutional reform program o f the Caretaker Government (CTG), which
                    assumed power in January 2007. The "Transitional" part o f the TSC reflects
                    the transitional nature o f the political situation.

                    The TSC would support a subset o f the CTG's wide-ranging reform agenda,
                    which is heavily focused on tackling critical and long-festering weaknesses in
                    core governance functions. Notably, the reforms have sought to strengthen and
                    enhance the autonomy o f important institutions o f accountability such as the
                    Election Commission and the Anti-Corruption Commission. Other measures
                    have included separation o f the lower judiciary from the executive, preparation
                    o f the Right to Information legislation, and formation o f the Regulatory
                    Reforms Commission to streamline business processes. The CTG i s also
                    deepening economic reforms in a number o f areas, including trade
                    liberalization, macroeconomic stability, and strengthening public financial
                    management and tax mobilization.

Benefits            Weak governance, emphasized by the CTG's reform program, has long been
                    recognized as the principal development challenge for Bangladesh. Corruption,
                    regulatory uncertainty, crime and disorder, and distrust o f the judiciary and
                    other    institutions  o f accountability      have  all  been pervasive.    The
                    confrontational nature o f politics was also damaging. Ensuring success o f the
                    governance measures would be critical for reviving private sector business
                    confidence, raising income levels and improving human development.
                    Reforms aimed at trade diversification and improving regulatory quality are
                    also important for stronger economic growth. Finally, the policy dialogue
                    under the TSC on macroeconomic stability has helped inform better policy
                    decisions to confront the various challenges currently being faced.

Risks               Political Risks: Although the election process remains broadly on track, a
                    numbero frisks remain. The two mainpolitical parties, the Awami League and
                    the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, are yet to present a coherent election
                    strategy. Moreover, both parties have demanded that the state o f emergency be
                    lifted or significantly relaxed ahead o f the elections. The CTG is yet to make a
                    formal decision on this issue. The US, UK, and other major bilateral partners
                    are in regular contact with the CTG over the election timetable and remain

                   positive intheir assessmento f the progress beingmade.
                   Sustainability of Reforms: Reversal o f governance reforms by the next
                   elected government i s a significant associated risk.The main assurance on the
                   longer-term sustainability o f the reforms comes from the broad-based public
                   support these enjoy and from the fact that a number o f key institutional
                   reforms have been locked-in by government decrees and ordinances.
                   Furthermore, in light o f the crunch situation faced by the budget, the financing
                   provided by the TSC would further strengthen the CTG's resolve in continuing
                   with the reformswithout having to cut social expenditure or fuel inflation.
                   Economic Risks: Extensive damage from successive floods followed by a
                   devastating cyclone in the first half o f FY08 and the unabated increases in
                   global commodity prices have put the economy under considerable strain.
                   Losses at the concerned SOEs have escalated, draining the government budget
                   and worsening the fragility o f the public sector banks that lend to the SOEs.
                   Regular adjustments in domestic commodity prices would be important to
                   secure sustainable macro balances. The poor in general have suffered
                   considerably due to the rising food (especially rice) prices exacerbated by
                   occasional disruptions in availability. Securing adequate food imports in the
                   coming months and reenergizing competitive private sector participation inthe
                   domestic supply chains would be important. Over the longer run, agricultural
                   productivity growth would need to pick up, for which the Government's recent
                   efforts to upgrade agricultural research bode well. Well-targeted support for
                   the poorer segments to protect them from food inflation is a priority area.
                   Natural Disasters: The events o f the past year are a cruel reminder o f
                   Bangladesh's inherent vulnerability to natural disasters, which the predicted
                   global climate changes would only heighten. A combination o f policy
                   measures and improvements in safety net programs, disaster awareness, early
                   warning systems, shelters and the improved capacity o f civil administration
                   have helped mitigate the impact o f the natural disasters. The country's
                   renowned NGOs are also playing an increasingly important role in disaster
                   prevention,  recovery, and relief. The Government, together with the
                   development partners, has also prepared a multi-pronged strategy aimed at
                   long-term mitigation o f natural disaster damage. The World Bank, ADB,
                   UNDAC, other specialized UN agencies, and several donor countries are
                   helping strengthen the government's capacity to respond to natural disasters.
                   An area in need o f improvement i s the early warning signal alerting system to
                   ensure that communities can better understand the level o f actual risk they face
                   andwhat they mustdo to protect themselves and their livelihoods.
                   Fiduciary Risks:Fungibilityo f funds implies that budgetary resources may be
                   diverted or misused. The Government, however, has a good record o f
                   allocating public spending to key development sectors and emergency relief
                   and rehabilitation activities, as seen in the context o f earlier natural disasters.
                   Auditing arrangements, financial management within government ministries,
                   and external oversight by the C&AG's office are also being strengthened. The
                   new procurement law i s expected to further reduce the scope for misuse o f
                   mdgetary funds in contracting. To enhance the safeguard framework,
                   Bangladesh Bank i s strengthening its financial management with support from
                   the IMF and the World Bank

                                               I. INTRODUCTION

1.       Bangladesh's development record in recent years has been impressive. Annual economic growth
has averaged over 6 percent over the last five years; poverty has declined at an annual rate o f two
percentage points-from         49 percent o f the population in2000 to 40 percent in2005; and progress toward
several other MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) has been satisfactory. This performance is all the
more noteworthy when viewed against the many development-constraining factors that the country faces.
Situated on a land area that i s almost a quarter that o f France, Bangladesh, with a population o f roughly
150 million, has twice as many people. Growing population i s crowding out land for agriculture. In
addition, one-third o f the country's scarce land is normally flooded for three months each year and natural
disasters (floods and cyclones) are a frequent occurrence. Yet, despite all this and a meager endowment
o f natural resources, Bangladesh has continued its steady economic and social progress.'

2.       The country, however, has proven far less resilient to a looming threat o f a different kind. This
threat comes in the form o f weak governance and ineffective institutions.                          Successive elected
governments since the early 1990s have focused on economic liberalization, deregulation and
macroeconomic stability, which generated good growth and enabled decline in the poverty rate. Efforts
to strengthen governance and build effective institutions that are necessary for a mature market economy
and service delivery have been lackluster and sporadic in comparison.                    This has led to widespread
corruption, government ineffectiveness, and lack o f functional institutions o f checks and balances.*

3.       A transformation o fthe governance landscape has begununder the current Caretaker Government
(CTG), which assumed power in January 2007 under difficult political circumstances. In what promises
to be a break from the past, the CTG, emboldened by widespread public support, i s giving clarity to the
legal status o f important institutions o f accountability while enhancing their autonomy and effectiveness.
The CTG is backed by the armed forces in implementing the anti-corruption and governance agenda.
Notwithstanding a few unresolved issues regarding the election process (more on this below), the CTG i s
making steady progress toward holding free and fair elections to the national parliament before the end o f
2008. Most notably, it has reconstituted the Election Commission (EC) and provided it operational
independence to reform the electoral process, political parties and campaign financing.

4.       A key element o f the governance agenda has been an unprecedented crackdown on high level
corruption to signal a move away from the previous culture o f impunity. Accession to the UN
Convention Against Corruption, and prosecutions o f a number o f former politicians, officials and
businessmenacross the political spectrum have been pivotal to this effort. Other notable measures have
included separation o f the lower judiciary from the executive; strengthening o f and provision o f greater
operational autonomy to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) and the Public Service Commission
(PSC); establishment o f stronger local government structures; and, improvements in the quality and
accountability o f public administration, including with the preparation and likely passage o f the Right to


I   Details o f this progresshave beenwell documentedin several recent Bank documents, including the ProgramDocuments of
    the four DevelopmentSupport Credits (DSCs) andthe SupplementaryFinancingto DSC IV.
    Observershave long wondered at the strong development-weakgovernancedisconnect, referring to it as the "Bangladesh
    paradox".

Information legislation. The CTG's initiatives to constitute the Bangladesh Better Business Forum to
foster dialogue between the government and the private sector, and the Regulatory Reforms Commission
(RRC) to modernize the existing administrative rules and regulations with specific focus on removing
bottlenecks for economic investment, commerce and trade are also steps in the right direction. This
governance reform programi s entirely home-grown and inresponse to domestic needs and priorities.

5.       Governance reforms are necessarily long-term in their gestation, and these are still early days in
Bangladesh.      Moreover, it i s also the case that in addressing corruption and building institutions o f
accountability, there can be some short-run costs. Indeed, some o f the anti-corruption measures on
occasions have appeared heavy-handed to private business, contributing to a decline in business
confidence and investment. Concerns have also been expressed about apparent lack o f due-diligence in
some prosecution cases. The short-run costs may be painful, but can be contained as lessons emerge from
experience. The institutional reforms, however, are well worth persistingwith in the larger interest o f the
society. In this context, broader political buy-in and continuity by the next elected government will be
essential.

6.       Complementing its efforts on strengthening governance, the CTG is deepening economic
reforms. It i s extending the bonded warehouse facility to a broader universeo f exporters to promote trade
diversification. This builds on reduction in the average nominal protection levels in the FY08 budget.
Macroeconomic stability, which remains a sine qua non for the development agenda, has required greater
policy attention because o f heightened external pressures.              Confronted with steep commodity price
inflation in global markets and unable to pass the price increases to domestic consumers, the Government
has nonetheless sought to maintain fiscal prudence by curtailing low priority investment projects and
ramping up tax collection. Policy measures to modernize tax administration and improve the institutional
oversight o f financial management functions have also been important, especially in light o f the poor
record on revenue mobilization and expenditure prioritization at the sector level. By setting up an
autonomous endowment fund to scale up and make more competitive the financing o f agricultural
research, the Government aims to stimulate agricultural productivity.

7.       The CTG i s keen for Bank support for its ongoing policy and institutional reform program. More
specifically, it has requested that the support be in the form o f a self-standing, one-off budget-support
operation.    The fiscal space generated by this support would bolster the CTG's efforts in following-
through with the difficult and often contentious governance reforms and deepening economic policy
reforms. It would also create fiscal space for developmental expenditure at a time when the budget i s
staggering under the weight o f the adverse external shocks that include the twin floods and cyclone Sidr
in2007 as well as the risingcommodityprices.

8.       The proposed Transitional Support Credit (TSC) directly responds to the CTG's specific request.
The "Transitional" part o f the TSC name reflects the transitional nature o f political situation in the
country. The World Bank Group's most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),3 discussed by the
Board in April 2006, envisaged a series o f Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) being initiated in
FY08 under a new elected government. Because o f the changed political situation and the tenure o f the
CTG getting prolonged to around two years, a one-off budget support operation seemed to be a more
appropriate instrument under the circ~mstances.~


'   World Bank, 2006, Country Assistance Strategy for the People's Republic of Bangladesh-FYO609,         Report No. 35193,
    Washington, D.C.
    The Bank's engagement in Bangladesh has been flexible, responding to reforms opportunities as they arise. A series o f
    single-tranche Development Support Credits (DSCs) have been processed since FY03 in support o f a reform program that
    sought to restore macroeconomic stability, address economic and structural stresses, and initiate governance reforms. A
    US$300 million DSC 1was approved by the Board inJune 2003 followed by DSCs 11,111, and IV, each o f US$200 million,

9.        The emphasis on governance reforms in the proposed operation i s hlly consistent with the
Bank's assistance strategy for the country, as laid out in the most recent FY06-09 CAS, which puts
governance at center stage cutting across the two pillars o f the Government's PRS (Poverty Reduction
Strategy)-improving       the investment climate and empowering the poor. To be sure, there are associated
risks, not least o f which has to do with the unusual political situation in the country and the possibility o f
reversal by the next elected government. The main assurance on the longer-term sustainability o f the
reforms comes from the broad-based public support these enjoy and from the fact that a number o f key
institutional reforms have been locked-in by government decrees and ordinances, which would not be
straightforward to reverse. The proposed operation would further help strengthen the CTG's hand in its
efforts to "lock in" important governance reforms. The remaining risk has to be balanced against the
opportunity to tackle weak governance, the single most important development challenge facing the
country.


                                          11.     RECENT      DEVELOPMENTS

PoliticalDevelopments

10.       Progress on the electoral roadmap remains on track. The roadmap announced by the EC on July
15, 2007 has two key milestones: voter list preparation and completion o f electoral reforms. Preparation
o f a digitized voter list with photographs is expected to be completed by end-October 2008: the EC has
already completed registration o f 75 percent o f an estimated 80 million voters. Electoral reforms are
somewhat behind schedule.              The EC has held consultations with political parties, civil society
organizations, interest groups and the media. Its dialogue with the former ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) has recently moved forward after being stalled because o f a feud within the party which has
resulted in a legal battle on the legitimacy o f alternative claims on BNP leadership. The EC will propose
enactment o f legal amendments for electoral reforms after reaching closure on the dialogue with the
political parties.

11.       Notwithstanding this progress, there are uncertainties about the conditions under which elections
are likely to be held. While the EC and the CTG as well as the Chief o f Army Staff have repeatedly
assured that election will be held by December this year, political parties remain apprehensive because the
election date has not been announced and no clear commitment has been made to lift or significantly relax
the state o f emergency well ahead o f elections. Agreement i s yet to be reached between the EC and the
political parties on the timing o f the long overdue local government (Upazilla) elections. Relaxation and
lifting o f the state o f emergency, political party reforms, parliamentary code o f conduct, ratification o f
institutional reforms enacted since January 11, 2007, and the CTG's exit strategy are likely to be among
the salient agenda items inthe CTG's dialogue with the political parties.

Natural Disasters

12.       Devastating floods struck Bangladesh inthe months o f July/August and again in September 2007.
Just as the country was beginning to recover from the floods, on November 15 large parts o f its coastal
area were hit hard by a Category-4 cyclone, Sidr. The physical damage caused by the floods and the
cyclone was estimated at US$2.7 billion (floods US$l.lbillion and cyclone US$1.6 billion), equivalent


     inJuly 2004, December2005, and May 2007, respectively. This complemented the IMF's PRGFprogram, which ended in
     June 2007. A US$75 million Supplemental Financing (SF1) to the DSC IV was completed in October 2007 to help the
     Government cope with spendingpressures arising from the floods, and a US$100million SF2 inJanuary 2008 inresponseto
     similarpressuresarising from the cyclone.




                                                            3

to 3.5 percent o f GDP.       These consisted o f loss o f standing crops, houses, livestock and roads.
Government programs for immediate relief and rehabilitation were estimated to cost US$850 million.
The Government secured about US$400 million in funding from development partners, including
commodity aid and NGO assistance. The direct budgetary cost for FY08 was estimated at US$450
million. It is being financed by improved revenue collection, within-budget substitution, and additional
budget support o f US$225 million (US$175 from IDA in the form o f the two supplemental credits to the
fourth Development Support Credit (DSC IV), and US$50 million from the Asian Development Bank
(ADB)). The remainingreconstruction and rehabilitationwill be implementedover the mediumto longer
term with additional foreign assistance.

13.      The recently concluded Joint Damage, Loss and Needs Assessment has outlined a long-term
strategy that integrates structural and nonstructural interventions in light o f the lessons learned from the
natural disasters over last two decades. Central to this strategy i s a long term disaster risk reduction
framework which has five strategic pillars: (a) risk identification and assessment; (b) strengthening and
enhancing emergency preparedness; (c) institutional and community capacity building; (d) risk mitigation
investments; and (e) introducing catastrophe risk financing in the longer term. A 15-year long-term plan
o f action would be required to achieve disaster risk reduction and management. Investments required for
its implementation are estimated at US$4 billion spread over three 5-year stages. The Bank i s ready to
help the government buildgreater economic resilience to natural disasters. It also stands ready to provide
both financial resources and technical assistance for better coastal zone management including
embankments and shelters.

EconomicDevelopments

14.      For the past several years Bangladesh has maintained an impressive overall record on
macroeconomic stability, marked by reasonable economic growth, fiscal and external sustainability, and
cautious monetary management. However, the record is beingincreasingly tested under difficult external
conditions. Inflationary pressures have been on the rise in recent years, driven in large part by rising
global food and commodity prices, and exacerbated by periods o f monetary policy laxity. More recently,
insufficient correction o f the administered energy and fertilizer prices has resulted in large losses for the
state-owned enterprises (SOEs), further straining an under-resourced budget already stretched thin by the
additional expenditures arising from the natural disasters. A slower export growth and higher import
growth in the current fiscal year has created pressure on the foreign exchange position o f the Bangladesh
Bank (BB), although continued strong growth o f remittance inflows has helpedcushion the shock.

15.      Despite prolonged political turmoil, growth o f gross domestic product (GDP) equaled 6.4 percent
inFY07, the fourth consecutive year of at least 6 percent growth (Table 1below). GDP growth has been
broad-based, shared across all major economic sectors and benefiting from robust demand in both
domestic and export markets. The manufacturing sector grew at an impressive 9.8 percent in FY07,
exceeding the 7.7 percent average manufacturing growth achieved in last five years. Garment exports,
which account for about 75 percent o f manufacturing exports, grew by 11.7 percent (in nominal dollar
terms) despite enhanced competition from other low-cost producers after the dismantling o f the
Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC). Construction, fueled by strong manufacturing growth as
well as large remittance inflows, grew by an estimated 7.3 percent, maintaining its 7-8 percent growth
record since FY94. Remittances through formal channels were recorded at nearly US$6 billion in FY07,
which i s about 9 percent o f GDP and half o f gross merchandize exports, compared with just US$1.9
billion inFYO1.

 Notes: (i) GFNS= Goods andnon factor services; (ii) *Starting from the revisedFY08 budget, the definition o f budgetdeficit has
 beenbroadenedto include explicitly the financingof the operatinglosses of the four largestloss-makingnonfinancial energy
 andfertilizer state-ownedenterprises(SOEs). The revisedFY08 budgetcovers 71percent of these losses.

16.       GDP growth is projected to slow down markedly in FY08, to somewhere in the 5.5-5.7 percent
range, largely on account o f three factors: (i)      agricultural output has suffered enormously, first from the
twin floods in 2007 summer and then from the cyclone Sidr inNovember, followed by outbreak o fbird
flu inDecember-January; (ii) slowdown in domestic private activity, as the aggressive anti-corruption
                                      a
drive staved-off private investment in new construction and capital machinery as well as conspicuous
consumption; and, (iii)       a widening o f the merchandize trade deficit, with garment exports in the first half
o f FY08 suffering from orders lost during late 2006 because o f political turmoil and labor unrest, and
large-scale import o f food items to cope with the natural disasters.                      Amid signs o f recovery in
manufacturing due to a strong rebound in merchandize exports and in construction activity, the FY08
GDP growth outturn may, in fact, be closer to the 5.7 mark. While the disruption to economic activity
caused by the natural disasters would be temporary, the impact o f the slide inbusiness confidence may be
more difficult to undo in the near future, particularly in view o f the uncertainty surrounding the elections
slated for the last quarter o f 2008.

17.      Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation has been on a rising trend, increasing steadily from an
average o f 1.5 percent in FYOl to 7.2 percent in FY07. The increase continued in the first seven months
o f FY08, with year-on-year inflation peaking at 11.6 percent in December 2007, driven mainly by food

 inflation, which increased to 14.5 percent. Non-food inflation was significantly lower at 7.3 percent,
 down from 8.3 percent inJune. Rice, wheat, and edible oil-major         components o f the Bangladeshi diet-
 have been the dominant sources o f food inflation in both rural and urban areas. Inflation subsequently
 declined to 11.4 percent in January and further to 10.1 percent in March 2008. Food inflation remained
 highat 12.9 percent inMarch2008 while non-food inflation declined further to 5.6 percent.

 18.      Rice price increases have dominated inflation. The price o f coarse rice in February 2008 was 46
 percent higher in rural areas and 39 percent higher in urban areas relative to February 2007, accounting
 for 89 percent of rural and 44 percent o f urban inflation. Since Bangladesh is a net importer o f rice,
 domestic prices are closely linked to international prices. India, the primary source o f rice imports for
 Bangladesh, has set a variety o f restrictions for exports o f its rice. Rice price in Bangladesh spiked each
 time India increasedits minimumexport price or imposed an export ban.

 19.      While rising international commodity prices have been the main contributors to inflationary
 pressures, the policy response has also been inadequate at times. Delayed adjustment in monetary policy
 and bank and direct budgetary financing o f rising SOE losses due to underpricing o f energy products and
 fertilizer further fueled inflation. The CTG's anti-hoarding efforts, which may have played a role in
 temporary disruptions infood supply chains, the damage to crops and transport infrastructure from floods
 and cyclone, and increase inminimumexport price o f rice by India from US$210 per ton to US$1,250 per
 ton within a span o f six months also added to short-term pressures on prices o f food and other essentials.
 Containing inflation requires better supply chain management, continued caution in the monetary policy
 stance and greater fiscal prudence, especially by containing SOE losses.

 20.      Monetary growth has declined significantly inrecent months, as demand for credit has fallen and
 authorities have adopted a cautious policy approach. Reserve money growth (year-on-year) fell from 26.9
 percent in January 2007 to 4.7 percent in January 2008, as net domestic assets o f BB declined by 23
 percent, offsetting the 35 percent increase in its stock o f net foreign assets. Year-on-year (y-0-y) broad
 money growth fell from 20.6 percent in January 2007 to 14.1 percent inJanuary 2008. Nominal interest
 rates have remained stable since November 2006 although inflation has increased by close to 4 percentage
points. The corresponding drop in real interest rates, occurring in a period o f monetary tightening, likely
reflects a sharp decline in demand for money resulting from a slowdown in economic activity.

21.       The external position has come under some pressure because o f slowdown in export growth, the
need to import large volumes o f food grain, and higher prices o f petroleum and fertilizer imports. After
recording negative y-0-y growth over the July-October period, exports have recovered strongly since
mainly on the back o f a rebound in garment exports, pushing y-0-y export growth over the July-February
period to 11.3 percent. Import payments increased by 19.7 percent over the first eight-months o f FY08,
yielding a trade deficit that was US1.1billion higher than over the same period o f the previous year.
Continued strong performance o f worker remittances (29 percent y-0-y growth inthe first nine months o f
FY08) and larger official transfers, however, helped ease the pressure and has kept the current account in
surplus since November 2007. This enabled a modest build-upo fgross foreign exchange reserves at BB,
from US$5.1 billion in end-FY07 to US$5.8 billion (equivalent to 3.0 months o f import cover) by end-
April 2008, and stabilized the exchange rate inthe Tk 68-69/US$ range. Nonetheless, without additional
balance-of-payment (BOP) support, official foreign exchange reserves were set to fall to an import cover
o f less than three months by end-FY08. Recognizing the need to stabilize its BOP position, the CTG
approached the IMF for emergency assistance o f US$217.7 million: the request was approved by the
Fund's Board onApril 2,2008.

22.      Fiscal prudence (in central government accounts) has largely been maintained since FY02. The
FY07 fiscal deficit stood at an estimated 3.2 percent o f GDP, smaller than the budgeted 3.7 percent. It
was the fifth successive year in which the deficit was kept below 4 percent o f GDP and domestic
financing at or below 2 percent o f GDP. This allowed total public debt to fall from 51 percent o f GDP in
FY04 to 46.5 percent in FY07. The revised FY08 budget projects the deficit at 4.8 percent o f GDP, with
domestic financing constituting 2.3 percent.

23.      The country's overall fiscal situation has come under heightened stress because o f mounting
losses o f state-owned energy and fertilizer companies, the budgetary impact o f the natural disasters and
increase in food subsidies.         Rising prices o f oil and fertilizers, without commensurate domestic
adjustment, have increased the overall subsidy (petroleum and fertilizer) to roughly US$1.8 billion
compared with US$745 million last year.5 Total subsidy in FY08 is projected at Tk 146 billion. The
FY08 revised budget has a provision o f Tk 117.7 billion for all subsidies, leaving Tk 29 billion


     The Government has also acquired Tk 75.4 billion of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation's debt to the Nationalized
     Commercial Banks inthis year's budget.



                                                        7

(equivalent to 0.5 percent o f GDP) to be financed o f f budget. The social and economic rationale for such
highsubsidies to petroleum and fertilizer is unclear, as evidence shows that bulk o f these accrue to the
better-off, crowd-out other development expenditures in the budget and add to inflationary pressures
arising from higher bank financing o fthe public sector deficit.

24.        Slower-than-normal utilization o f Annual Development Program (ADP) spending-with                                     a
utilization rate o f 25 percent o f the programmed amount for the fiscal year by January 2008-has                           lifted
some pressure on the fiscal situation, although at the likely expense o f longer-term development impact.
Another alleviating factor has been revenue mobilization, which, thus far, has outpaced projections for the
year. Tax revenue growth for the first seven months of FY08 clocked a record 24.6 percent, compared
with only 9.5 percent in the same period o f FY07. Introduction o f a special time bound opportunity to
disclose undeclared income in the early part o f FY08 and the newly introduced universal self assessment
system, which increased individual taxpayer submissions threefold, have yielded a 41.6 percent increase
in income tax collection. Intense monitoring o f activities o f taxpayers and officials by National Bureau
revenue (NBR) and other relevant government agencies has also been an important enabler o f the recent
improvement in tax collection. Non-tax revenue has performed even better, registering record growth o f
34 percent for July-December 2007. Yet, projected at 11.3 and 9 percent o f GDP in the revised FYO8
budget, the total revenue-to-GDP and tax-to-GDP ratios remain among the lowest in the world
highlightingthe needto sustain this progress.

25.        The revised FY08 budget projects central government fiscal deficit at 4.8 percent o f GDP!                        This
includes a significant expansion in the coverage o f off-budget SOE financing in the central government
budget, to 1.7 percent o f GDP. Thus, the FY08 central government budget deficit estimate, comparable                             I
to last year's 3.2 percent deficit out-turn, i s 3.1 percent o f GDP. While a sizable amount o f off-budget                           I

financing still remains in FY08, as noted, the Government has decided to eventually cover all off-budget
SOE financing explicitly inthe central government budget starting from FY09.


                    111.     BANGLADESH'SPOVERTY               REDUCTION         STRATEGY: AN UPDATE

26.        Bangladesh's development vision has been detailed in its Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)
adopted in November 2005. The PRS was set to expire in June 2007, but was subsequently extended by
the CTG up to June 2008 with an updated medium term macroeconomic framework and policy matrix.
The PRS stresses the links between investment, growth, job creation, and poverty reduction, and
identifies key areas where reforms are needed, public investments are required, and public policies merit
improvement.

27.        As indicated inthe Joint StaffAdvisory Note (JSAN),' the PRS vision appropriately buildsonthe
policy triangle o f growth, human development, and governance. Reflecting on the theme o f governance,
the JSAN noted that a greater focus was needed on improving governance in sectors, especially power.
The lack o f specificity on sectoral governance reforms, despite the strong focus on overall governance,
suggested the need to broaden ownership for governance reforms within the government.

28.        Acknowledging these and other gaps noted in the JSAN, the authorities are planning to address
them in the second PRS, now under preparation.* More specifically, on the governance front, the CTG



     This assumes 85 percent ADP utilization, which is on the high side relative to the 80 percent average utilization achieved in
'*   last five years and 36 percent of the original FY08 ADP size utilizedinthe first three quarters of FY08.
     IDA and IMF, December2005, "Joint IDA-IMF StaffAdvisory Note on the Poverty Reduction Strategy."
     A three-member group has been formed to draft the PRS based on 18 thematic papers being prepared and stakeholder
     consultations are underway. The first draft of the full PRS report is expectedby end-June2008.



                                                                 8

has been implementing its anticorruption and institutional reform agenda.                  As noted earlier, the
governance reform program i s home-grown and has full ownership o f the CTG.

                          IV.      THEBANK'SCOUNTRYASSISTANCESTRATEGY

29.      Putting governance at center stage, the World Bank Group's most recent CAS aligns itself with
the government's PRS. Inparticular, in the FY06-09 CAS, governance cuts across the two pillars o f the
PRS-improving       the investment climate and empowering thepoor-while         addressing the core governance
issues common to these two pillars. Under pillar 1, improving the investment climate, the Bank Group
proposes to build on Bangladesh's strengths by continuing to help maintain macroeconomic stability and
accelerating its progress toward an open, market-based economy. At the same time, it offers to help the
Government address weaknesses in the investment climate by removing policy and institutional
constraints to infrastructure provision and improving its weak regulatory quality.              Under pillar 2,
empowering the poor, the Bank Group will continue to build on Bangladesh's impressive social gains by
helping the Government meet the MDGs relating to human development.                    It also proposes to help
improve the quality and efficiency o f service provision to the poor by strengthening sector governance,
and enhancing voice and participation.

30.      The reform agenda being supported under the proposed TSC operation, with its heavy emphasis
on strengthening the core governance functions, is consistent with the priority that the CAS accords to
governance and heeds its advice to be responsive to major reform opportunities as they may arise. A
subset o f the governance reforms was initiated under the DSC series, albeit at an unsatisfactory pace. In
addition to supporting progress on this unfinished agenda and deepening o f economic reforms started
under the DSCs, the TSC would make good use o f the unique opportunity presented by the CTG's bold
and credible efforts to undertake core institutional reforms that were missing in previous operations for
the simple reasono f lack offull government ownership.


        v.       REFORMSSUPPORTED UNDER THE PROPOSEDTRANSITIONALSUPPORT CREDIT

31.      As noted above, the CTG, on its own accord and in response to the domestic political and
economic priorities, has pursued a wide-ranging reform agenda to tackle critical and long-festering
weaknesses in its governance functions.            It has sought to codify institutional mandates for core
institutions o f accountability, such as the judiciary, the ACC, and the EC, while arming them with greater
operational autonomy. Efforts to reduce systemic sources o f corruption and bring greater accountability
in the working o f the executive have also been noteworthy.          If sustained, these measures promise to
reshape the governance landscape o f the country in a way that did not seem possible not too long ago.
Many o f the critical governance reforms, accordingly, are at the heart o f the proposed TSC.
Complementing its efforts o f institutional reforms, the CTG i s deepening economic reforms that have
been ongoing in the country for the past several years. In this context, the TSC proposes to support
reforms aimed at trade diversification and improving regulatory quality, reform areas that have been
identified as being crucial for stronger economic growth in Banglade~h.~Macroeconomic stability
remains a sine qua non for the development agenda, particularly in view o f the heightened external
pressures emanating from rising commodity prices. Modernization o f tax administration and improving
the institutional oversight o f financial management functions are also important, especially inlight o f the
poor record on revenue mobilization and expenditure prioritization which hampers government
effectiveness. The TSC therefore proposes to support a core subset o f the institutional and policy reform
agenda beingpursued by the CTG. The key elements o f these reforms are provided below.

 Macroeconomic Stability

 32.      Macroeconomic stability was broadly maintained under the DSC-supported program. The fiscal,
 monetary, and external indicators remained mostly within the thresholds o f the macroeconomic
 framework agreed with the IMF under the Poverty Reduction Grant Facility (PRGF) program that ended
 in June 2007. However, there are now emerging stresses. The major threat to macroeconomic stability
 comes from the unremitting global commodity and fertilizer price inflation, the brunt o f which has been
 felt by the intermediating state-owned companies. Administered petroleum prices were last adjusted on
 April 1, 2007 and power prices in March 2007, while fertilizer price adjustment has been long overdue.
 Since then oil prices have increased by close to US$50 per barrel (over 80 percent) in international
 markets. Urea prices have not been adjusted in the last eleven years during which the urea import price
 has increased by Tk 25,000 per ton-an       increase o f over 275 percent. The resulting financial loss in
 FY08 from underpricing o f food, fertilizer, oil, power, and natural gas indomestic markets i s projected to
 be around US$1.8 billion, or 2.4 percent o f GDP.

 33.      Losses at the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) are expected to significantly
 exceed the provisioned Tk 6 billion (US$87 million) transfer from the budget in FYO8. In light o f the
 complex challenges in the power sector-continuing       financial shortfalls and poor performance because o f
weak governance-and       the importance o f the sector for sustaining highgrowth inBangladesh," a parallel
 one-off, budget-support operation for the sector i s being prepared by the Bank.

34.       The Government has had to rely on reductions in development expenditures to fund disaster-
related expenses and cover SOE losses in order to contain domestic financing within a sustainable limit.
An exacerbating factor is a 38 percent decline in the net sale o f the National Savings Directorate (NSD)
certificates in the first seven months o f FY08 as compared to the previous year, thus necessitating the
funding o f subsidies through bank borrowing. The latter may be more inflationary than passing on
international marketprice increases to domestic consumers.

35.       The difficult fiscal situation needs to be addressed to fully restore macroeconomic stability.
Continuation o f the good progress made this year in strengthening revenue mobilization would be
certainly helpful.   The more urgent policy issue, however, has to do with the weak finances of the
concerned SOEs which risk undermining fiscal sustainability. The choices before the Government are
tough ones.      Budget subsidies to cover SOE losses will continue to eat into hnding o f critical
developmental expenditure if overall fiscal prudence i s to be maintained, or lead to higher public sector
borrowing. Authorities can alleviate the fiscal pressure by raising prices o f energy products and fertilizer
to bringthem closer to their cost, a direction inwhich they would like to move in coming weeks. Mindful
o f the impact o f any price adjustment on the poor, authorities plan to also institute more targeted subsidies
to the affected groups.

          Prior Action (1 of 8): The Government has achieved sustainablefiscal balances through a mix of
          actions that include (i) credible efforts to bolster revenue mobilization: (ii) reduction in the
          Annual Development Program expenditures by dropping or putting on hold low priority new and
          ongoing investment project: and (iii) initiation of measures including adjustment in administered
         prices to stem thepow of state-owned enterprise losses which, in turn, will reduce the burden of
          subsidies on the Government budget.

36.       The Government has reduced the size o f the FY08 ADP by 15 percent. It also undertook an
intense revenue collection drive which resulted in overshooting o f the original FY08 budget revenue
target by 5.6 percentage points. As a result, total revenue in FY08 is expected to grow by 24 percent.

 The Government increasedthe price o f compressed natural gas (CNG) from Tk 8.5 per cubic meter to Tk
 16.75 per cubic meter on April 24, 2008. This is estimated to have an annual revenue impact o f Tk 3.3
 billion, equivalent to about 3.3 percent o f the estimatedFY08 SOE losses inthe energy sector.

 Strengthening Institutionsof Accountability

 37.      The CTG has pursued a far-reaching agenda o f institutionalreforms. Inreforming the institutions
 o f accountability, efforts have focused on amending the regulatory framework, puttinginplace processes
 which will minimize the potential for politicization o f the institutions. The ACC, operationalization o f
 which was supported by the DSC series, is carrying out its activities with much more vigor after the CTG
 amended the ACC act to enhance its independence and clarify its jurisdiction. The EC and the PSC, both
 with new leadership, are also operating with far greater impartiality and dynainisin than in the past.

 38.      Almost immediately after taking office, the CTG took concrete steps to comply with the
 Appellate Division ruling in the Masdar Hossain case," which had ordered the separation o f lower
judiciary from the executive branch o f government. This long-pending but important reform measure i s
being supported under the proposed TSC.                    The legal steps have been completed and the related
 administrative measures such as the creation o f new posts and recruitment are proceeding. In an effort to
 depoliticize appointments to the higher judiciary, the Government recently announced the formation o f a
 Supreme Judicial Commission (SJC) that will make recommendations for candidates to be appointed as
judges in the HighCourt and Appellate divisions o f the Supreme Court.

          Prior Action (2 of 8): The Government has (9 established a SupremeJudicial Commissionfor the
          selection of High Court and Appellate Division judges; and (ii) taken all necessary and
          appropriate action to give effect to the Appellate Division'sjudgment regarding the separation of
          the executivefrom thejudiciary in Secretary, Ministry of Finance v. Masdar Hossain case.

39.       The establishment o f the SJC i s intended to ensure transparency and impartiality in the
appointment o fjudges to the HighCourt and the Appellate Division o f the Supreme Court.12 Earlier, the
President used to appoint the judges on the sole advice o f the Prime Minister creating allegations on the
politicization o f these appointments. The Ordinance to establish the SJC, promulgated in March 2008,
envisages setting up a nine-member commission headed by the Chief Justice to recommendnames to the
President for appointment o f judges. The SJC will comprise o f the Law Minister, the two senior most
judges o f the Appellate Division, the Attorney General, two Members o f Parliament-one                               to be
nominated by the leader o f the Parliament and the other by the leader o f the opposition, President o f the
Supreme Court Bar Association and the Law Secretary. The completion o f all legal steps to separate the
lower judiciary from the executive has been long awaited and widely demanded. Implementationo f this
important measure i s expected to ensurejustice without undue delay and influence o f the judicial process
by the executive branch o f government, as was often the case before.

40.       Corruption cases against a number o f former high-profile politicians, officials and businessmen
are proceeding. An inter-agency approach to tackling corruption has been yielding results. Bangladesh
acceded to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) in February 2008, and i s
currently reviewing its legal and regulatory framework to ensure compliance. The accession to UNCAC
"loclcs" Bangladesh into a framework o f international co-operation in this area.                       Furthermore, the
Government is actively engaged in seeking the recovery o f stolen assets abroad. It has established a high


"    Secretary, Ministry of Finance v Masdar Hossain 20 BLD (2000) AD 141.
12   On a writ petition filed by a Supreme Court lawyer on April 28, 2008, the High Court stayed for three months the
     functioning of the SJC and asked the Government to explain within three weeks why the Ordinance shall not be declared
     unconstitutional. The allegations, among others, are that the Ordinance gives too much control to the President over the
     appointments and that the executive and legislature are over represented inthe Commission.



                                                               11

 level inter-ministerial committee chaired by the Governor o f Bangladesh Bank to oversee this effort and
 an operational taskforce to carry out the needed tasks.

41.       The CTG has begun work in earnest to institutionalize the public's right to information. A
 committee has also been set up with representatives from the Law Ministry,Law Commission, the Public
 Information Department, and the civil society to work on the drafting o f a Right-to-Information
 Ordinance.     The draft ordinance proposes an institutionalized framework for access to information,
 including provisions for suo moto di~closure.'~Promoting transparency and sharing information are
 among the core set o f reforms beingsupportedby the TSC.

         Prior Action (3 of 8): The Government has undertaken the preparation of a draft ordinance on
         the Right-to-Information through a transparent and consultative process that includes discussion
         with civil society and other relevant stakeholders.

42.      The draft Right-to-Information Ordinance has been posted on the Information Ministrywebsite
for public comments. The Ordinance would reflect internationally accepted best practices regarding the
disclosure o f information.

43.      Local government elections are planned to commence in the second quarter o f 2008. Recently,
the seven-member Committee for Accelerating and Strengthening Local Government, formed by the CTG
in June 2007, submitted its report to the Chief Adviser, recommending a far-reaching decentralization
agenda. The Committee recommended, amongst other things, the establishment o f a Local Government
Commission to regulate and steer the decentralization process, and also included a draft unified ordinance
for Zila, Upazila and Union Parishads, municipalities, and city corporations. The decentralization agenda
holds considerable promise, especially in so far as it would increase political competition.

44.      The CTG has also constituted a 17-member Regulatory Reforms Commission (RRC) to amend
the administrative rules and regulations to facilitate doing business.                It has also constituted the
Bangladesh Better Business Forum (BBBF) in order to foster dialogue between the government and the
private sector. Actions designed to operationalize the RRC are being supported by the TSC.

         Prior Action (4 of 8): The Government has: (i) established an electronic registry of regulations
         which are inforce andplaced on the Bangladesh Government's Press 's web~ite;'~and (ii) taken
         appropriate action to ensure that its agencies have adopted a majority of the recommendations in
         the Regulatory Reform Action Plan.

Strengthening and ModernizingRevenueAdministration

45.      Acting on its expressed concern over the poor tax collection record, the Government has initiated
separation o f the tax policy function from tax administration, and has agreed to review the value-added
tax (VAT) and income tax legislations as part o f its overall effort to simplify the tax system. It has also
introduced universal self-assessment in income tax and direct trader input in import cargo clearance,
which should help boost revenue mobilization and improve transparency of the process. Furthermore, it
wants to roll out unique taxpayer identification numbers (UTINs) to large taxpayers and continue
strengthening the Central Intelligence Cell.

46.      The Government has further decided to merge the two Large Taxpayer Units (LTUs) for VAT
and income tax. The two LTUs, which were set-up under the NBR's modernization program that the

DSC series supported, are off to a good start and handle about 60 percent o f NBR's income tax and VAT
collection. But they work with little coordination with each other, which the merger would address. The
Government is expected to soon announce a roadmap with clearly specified, time-bound milestones on
the merger o f the two LTUs under the NBR. It has appointed a Member in-charge o f the two LTUs as the
 first step o f the merger pro~ess.'~

47.       These measures are parts o fthe Government's overall effort to undertake a fundamental reform o f
the tax system with a view to simplifying legislation, broadening the tax base, and improving the design
o f the VAT and income tax. It i s envisaged that the Income Tax Ordinance o f 1984 would be re-written
after a careful review to reduce the use o f final withholding taxes, and clearly separate the basic tax
provisions from tax relief. Similarly, the VAT Act o f 1991 would be re-written to replace the existing
excise-cum-turnover tax system by a modem invoice-credit based VAT that extends to the retail level;
separate the supplementary duties from the VAT Act; and increase the turnover threshold.

48.       Efforts to strengthen customs revenue and administration will require a stronger push.
Particularly important would be steps to (i) reduce the number o f zero-rated commodities; (ii)
                                                         further
review and nullify the existing regulatory orders that specify exemptions from customs duties; (iii)
complete the full automation o f customs houses; and (iv) expand training o f customs officers.

StrengtheningInstitutionsfor ExpenditureManagement

49.       Bangladesh has a good record o fmaintaining fiscal prudence and broadly allocating expenditures
to priority sectors such as education, health, infrastructure, and rural development.                      Nonetheless,
considerable scope remains to improve expenditure effectiveness.                         Crucially, budget planning and
execution are still at a fairly rudimentary stage with a weak link between policy planning, expenditure
allocation and policy implementation, as reflected in the perpetual underutilization o f the ADP. Essential
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems are still beingdeveloped; budget oversight functions are yet to
be clearly demarcated. A number o f importantreform measures have beeninitiatedto tackle these gaps.

50.       A Public Resources and Budget Management Ordinance (PRBMO) is currently under
preparation. The Ordinance aims to tightenfiscal discipline and enhance transparency, accountability and
quality o f the expenditures o f the public sector, including the SOEs. The current draft proposes to put
specific limits on public borrowing from domestic sources (including the Bangladesh Bank), suppliers'
credit and contingent liability with government guarantee, domestic debt and foreign debt. It would also
require the Finance Ministerto brief the parliament about revenue earnings and government expenditures
every three months, and to place inparliament a mid-term budget with projections on public incomes and
expenditures for next two years. Moreover, subsidy or investment support to SOEs would have to be
clearly specified inthe budget.

          Prior Action (5 of 8): The Government has approved in principle a draft Public Resource and
          Budget Management Ordinance (PRBMO) 2008.

51.       The draft PRBMO is expected to be promulgated before the end o f the current fiscal year after
vetting by the Law Ministry.

52.       To improve the effectiveness o f spending, the Government continues to expand the medium-term
budget framework (MTBF) as part o f its effort to develop a more strategic approach to budget planning.
The MTBF-a reform measure that was explicitly supported under the DSC series-has now been
introduced in 14 ministries (four o f which were added in the FY08 budget), and there are plans to cover

l5   Inthe next 12 months the Government plans to have a unifiedorganogram for the merged LTUs and a combinedUTINfor
     the two LTU files will become effective starting July after the FY09 budget process is complete.



                                                                13

 another 2 ministries in the FY09 budget. This will bring MTBF coverage to about 60-70 percent o f total
budgetary expenditure. The emphasis continues to be on better integration o f the revenue (recurrent) and
development (investment) budget planning processes at the center and line ministries, by unifying the
budget preparation process and issuing an integrated budget ceiling for line ministries. This process,
however, is still inits infancy, and needs to be significantly deepened before it can produce tangible gains
inthe form ofbetter budget and service delivery outcomes.

 53.     The Government is seeking to improve the accuracy and timelines o f expenditure and public debt
information, notably by developing a system o f computerized accounting transactions. The system has
been improved to deploy some elements o f an Integrated Financial Management System linking in a
Wide Area Network (WAN) all offices. It has also taken steps to separate cash and debt management
functions, thus minimizing the possibility o f automatic inflationary financing o f the fiscal deficit.

54.      A number o f measures have sought to strengthen internal and external accountability, audit and
scrutiny.   To improve the internal audit function, the Government has prepared an Internal Control
Manual. On the external audit side, the time lag for final audited accounts has been reduced from two to
one year.    Furthermore, an appropriate legal framework providing the C&AG more financial and
administrative authority is being initiated, and a committee i s being created to oversee the public
accounts; a move well received by all concerned.l6

55.      The Government is considering a Public Financial Management Improvement Program (PFMIP)
which would aim to institutionalize a more strategic approach to budget planning and allocation o f
resources. It would also like to build a more performance-oriented budget management process while
strengthening financial accountability across the ministries. As part o f this effort, it i s seeking to separate
the accounting functions from the audit functions, a reform measure that the TSC would support. This
will allow better deployment o f skills to perform financial management functions and eventually the
development of a broader PFM cadre to provide full financial management support to ministries.

         Prior Action (6 of 8): The Government has approved an action plan to separate the accounts
         and auditfunctions ofpublicJinancia1 management.

56.      Bangladesh has made steady progress in improving the transparency and competitiveness in
public procurement, an area typically rife with corruption. The landmark procurement law, which was
adopted inJuly 2006 with DSC series supporting its preparation, became effective from January 31,2008,
with detailed rules guiding its implementation. There is enhanced awareness about the new law among
the implementing agencies, and all public procuring entities have started following the law, including the
complaint redress mechanism by independent review panels. Transparency o f the procurement system is
improving further with the publication o f bid notices and contract award information in the website o f .
Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU), including publication o f procurement performance data o f
two leading agencies, the Rural Electrification Board (REB) and the Local Government Engineering
Department (LGED). This transparency measure was supported under DSC IV. This progress has
enabled Bangladesh to secure B ratings inthree o f the four PFM indicators on procurement.

57.      While these reforms have laid the foundations for a more effective public procurement system, a
number of cross-cutting concerns still remain. Inorder to further improve the public procurement system
and make the reform sustainable, the Government, with the Bank's technical assistance, has started
implementation o f a second procurement reform project, with interventions in institutionalizing
procurement capacity development, strengthening implementation and monitoring at the sectoral level,
piloting e-government procurement (e-GP) to increase transparency and competition, and engaging the

businessbodies and civil society inthe monitoring o f the contracting process and procurement outcomes.
The project started implementationwith slow progress, and there are issues relating to strengthening the
CPTU with adequate staffing from revenue budget as approved in the Government's Technical Assistance
Project Proposal.

Restructuringof State-OwnedEnterprises

58.      The CTG i s continuing with the earlier efforts to restructure key SOEs. Four loss-making jute
mills were shut down in July 2007. The size o f the labor force in four SOEs-Bangladesh                           Biman,
Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation, Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation, and Bangladesh Freedom
Fighter Welfare Trust-has         been reduced. So far in FY08 a total o f 16,237 workers have taken the
Government's offer o f Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS).

59.      The SOE reform program includes changing Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board
(BTTB), a one-time monopoly and the largest fixed telephone line entity, into a public limited company
named Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL). Restructuring BTTB into BTCL has
already been approved in principle by the Council o f Advisors, and the Ministry o f Post and
Telecommunications has been directed to report back with a final draft o f BTCL Ordinance 2008 after
vettingby the Ministryo fLaw. The restructured entity is expected to:

         implement a new business strategy (that has been prepared with the help o f a Bank project);
         offer cheaper domestic and international leased lines to its customers;
         expand its interconnection capacity and therefore provide better quality o f services;
         be requiredto abide by its license terms and conditions, leading to a more level playing field.

60.      Successful completion o f BTTB and Biman restructuring i s among the core policy actions
supported by the TSC. The Government would like further support from the Bank on implementation o f
BTTB restructuring.        The Bank is also supporting the telecommunications sector through a technical
assistance operation that focuses on improving the regulatory environment and on strengthening the
policy function at the Ministry o f Post and Telecommunications.l7

61.      For more regular and transparent scrutiny o f the finances o f Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation
(BPC), BPDB, and the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation, the three biggest loss-making SOEs,
the Government has introduced flash reporting o f their quarterly financial performance. Their July-
September and October-December performance reports for 2007 are up on the MoF website.

        Prior Action (7 of 8): The Council of Advisors has (i) approved the corporatization of Biman
        Bangladesh Airlines as a company registered under the Bangladesh Companies Act 1994and (ii)
        approved, in principle, an ordinance constituting the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone
        Board as public limited company to be called the Bangladesh Telecommunications Company
        Limited under the Bangladesh CompaniesAct 1994.

62.     The Government has reconstituted the Biman board, with eight out o f the ten members from the
private sector.    Biman i s planning further cost reduction by retiring more staff through VRS, while
working out public-private partnership models for its operation and ownership as well as other
restructuring measures to make its operations more profitable.                    It has been registered under the


    Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission on April 28,2008 issued call centre licenses to 21 local companies
    with a projection o f an annual revenue of US$6.5 billion from this service-oriented business-the most recent positive
    development inthe rapidly expanding telecommunication sector.




                                                           15

 Bangladesh Companies Act to make it a public limited company. Along with payment o f VRS, the
 Government also has an ongoing counseling and retraining program as part o f a Social Protection
 Package for the retired SOE workers. This social protection package i s being executed by BRAC, a
 leadingNGO.

 Trade Liberalization

 63.      Average nominal import tariff protection was cut from 24.3 percent to 21.9 percent in the FY08
 budget. Furthermore, the tariff structure was simplified by collapsing the Infrastructural Development
 Surcharge with the customs duty and eliminating zero-tariff status for many products. In addition,
 efficiency at the Chittagong Port, which handles about 90 percent of the country's merchandize trade, has
 seen a marked improvement since the CTG came to power. According to official estimates, the average
 turnaround time for ships at the port fell from 11.6 days in January 2007 to under 3 days in December
 2007. These reforms followed several previous rounds o f liberalization supported under the DSC series
which yielded sharp reductions in the average tariff rate and elimination o f trade-related quantitative
restrictions. Responding to the liberalization measures, the ratio o f merchandize trade to GDP increased
 from 28 percent in FYOO to 41 percent inFY07.

 64.      Notwithstanding this progress, the remaining trade reform agenda is substantial.               Despite the
declining trend, average nominal protection in Bangladesh i s the highest in the region and among the
highest in the world. Reductions in customs duties have been partly offset by an increase in the use of
other protective tariffs (para-tariffs), which now account for 27 percent o f total protection, although this i s
down from 37 percent in FY07.             This, together with cumbersome trade facilitation procedures, an
inefficient duty drawback system, and remaining bottlenecks at the port, has resulted in the anti-export
bias leveling o f f at relatively highlevels since the late 1990s. This works against the emergence of new
export activities and expansion o f the export activities to non-enclave areas."          It is no surprise then that
the export base is heavily concentrated in garments, the sector facing the most liberal import regime
largely because o f its access to bonded warehouse facility. RMG exports account for about 75 percent o f
merchandise exports.

          Prior Action (8 of 8): The Government has adopted a new policy on export competitiveness.

65.       In response to the need to diversify the export base, the Government has extended the bonded
warehouse facility to other sectors.         This is a major step forward toward the export diversification
objective. Implementation o f this policy has begun with the granting o f Special Bonded Warehouse
facility to the ship buildingindustryinthe week o f April 20,2008.

ImprovingAgricultural Productivity

66.       Higher productivity growth o f agricultural production (crops, livestock and fisheries) will be
essential to Bangladesh's poverty reduction objectives.                Productivity improvements will require
considerable progress on modernization, intensification and diversification, for which availability o f
appropriate production and post-harvest technologies to farmers would be essential.

67.       Unlike in the past, when the adoption o f "green revolution" technologies (improved seeds,
fertilizer, pest management and irrigation) resulted in dramatic increase inrice yields, the research system
faces a number o f more complex constraints to effectively generate and transfer improved technologies.
A dynamic and productive public agricultural research system is now needed, especially to meet the
technology needs o f small and marginal farmers, who constitute majority o f the rural poor, and to protect
the nation's natural resource base and the environment. There is strong empirical evidence to show that

investment in agricultural research yields a high impact on economic growth and poverty reduction
relative to many other public sector investments.

68.      At about 0.2 percent o f agricultural GDP, public investment in agricultural research is very low
by international standards (the average is 0.6 percent for developing countries and 2.8 percent for
developed countries). Research funding has also been unstable due to heavy dependence on externally
financed projects which can be unpredictable. The current and foreseeable public expenditure programs
are unlikely to provide sufficient resources to make up for the funding gap.                       Recognizing this, the
Government i s in the process o f establishing a stable and sustainable mechanism for the national
agricultural research system through a recently constituted Endowment Trust Fund, a reform measure that
i s being supported under the TSC."           The Government already has experience in setting up an endowment
fund for the NGO foundation as well as financing the competitive grants program; each has had a good
start. The proposed fund will generate a long-term, sustainable and stable funding to bridge the critical
gap and enable the research system to develop and transfer a steady flow o f appropriate technologies to
accelerate agricultural growth.

69.      The Government has already established an independent KrishiGabeshona Foundation(KGF) for
effective management o f the grants generated by the Endowment Trust Fund to finance the competitive
grants program. A legal framework as well as necessary oversight mechanism for the management and
functioning o f Fund has been established. The Government plans to register the Endowment Trust Fund
underthe Trust Act.

Banking

70.     Restructuring o f the Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs) was a core component o f the
reform program supported under the previous DSC series. The Government made good progress in the
area, completing all formalities to divest Rupali Bank and corporatizing three o f the four NCBs in 2007.
However, the banking sector reforms received a major setback in March 2008 when the Government was
forced to drop Rupali Bank from its privatization list. This was after the winning foreign bidder failed to
sign the Sales and Purchase Agreement within the scheduled time despite several extensions.                               An
expensive and time-consuming effort that eventually came to nothing, this comes as a major dampener on
the overall reformprogram, that had includedplanned divestment o f at least two other NCBs.

71.     The NCBs need to be relieved from quasi-fiscal activities, made less prone to financial strain, and
reduce credit spreads through increased competition in the banking sector. Corporatization o f the three
NCBs i s a significant move toward addressing this. Moreover, the Boards o f the banks have been
reconstituted and now comprise o f individuals from diverse backgrounds, including the private sector.
Further, BB continues to tighten the prudential regulations and strengthen its supervisory power and
practices. Minimum capital requirements have been raised to improve banks' resilience and promote
further consolidation o fthe banking sector. BB will start publishingadjusted capital adequacy ratios that
take into account banks' provisioning shortfalls and accumulated losses.

72.     The priority reform areas and the corresponding policy actions that the TSC would
support, along with monitorabledevelopment indicators, are listed inthe Policy Matrix inAnnex 1.

    reducing transaction cost for the recipient by allowing contributions from multiple donors.

                                VI.     IMPLEMENTATION      ARRANGEMENTS

 Monitoring and Evaluation

 73.     Improving the quality and effectiveness o f policies will require more timely and reliable
 information for policy analysis and assessing outcomes. The PRS outlines a monitoring framework,
 which includes monitoring indicators, data sources, and institutional arrangements for monitoring and
 providing feedback to policy makers. Sources include existing data as well as plannedannual surveys for
 tracking intermediate indicators related to access, usage, and satisfaction with public services. While
 such annual tracking surveys have not materialized yet, they are a part o f the future agenda o f Bangladesh
 Bureau o f Statistics (BBS), as indicated below.

 74.     Repeated rounds o f Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) conducted by the BBS
 are the single most important basis for poverty monitoring and analysis. The HIES o f 2000 provided
 baseline information for most outcome indicators identified in the PRS and the 2005 round o f HIES
 updated information on these indicators. The HIES 2005 report incorporates poverty trends and patterns
 based on a revised poverty line, reflecting the latest sampling design and consumption pattern. These
 provide a solid basis for consistent monitoring o f poverty, household consumption and inequality from
 the existing and future rounds o f HIES. Additional information on MDGindicators i s provided by other
 surveys such as the Demographic and Health Surveys and Child Nutrition Surveys. A Labor Force
 Survey conducted by the BBS (the latest round in 2005-06) provides information on indicators related to
 employment and characteristics o f the labor force. The next round o f the HIES is planned for 2009 to
 supplement the partial fundingthat i s likely to be providedby the government.

 75.     Efforts are also underway to improve monitoring o f performance in PFM. The Government has
 already developed baseline ratings o f the core P F M functions. Moreover, a PFMIP has been initiated
which would seek to implement the Government's PFM strategy and rolling action plan and provide a
platform for harmonized development assistance under a World Bank administered Multi-Donor Trust
 Fund.

 76.     In recent years, capacity improvement in M&E has occurred along multiple dimensions.
Technical Assistance from the World Bank, including an ongoing Institutional Development Facility
grant, has helped BBS improve the survey quality and speed o f data processing over successive rounds o f
HIES. The IDF grant funded the HIES rounds o f 2000 (fully) and 2005 (partially), which has resulted in
a survey that i s accepted in the country as the only source for monitoring consumption poverty and other
related indicators o f economic and social progress.       Given the central role o f HIES in monitoring
outcomes including MDGs, identifying predictable funding sources to conduct this survey at regular
intervals would be important for sustaining the M&E framework.

77.     The capacity o f BBS to measure and analyze poverty and its correlates using household survey
data has benefited from close on-the-job collaboration with the Bank. A number o f training courses and
workshops-some       administered by the World Bank Institute-have     enhanced the analytical capacity at
BBS, government departments, and think tanks, and capacity buildinginmore advanced types o f analysis
has been initiated. With technical assistance from the Bank, BBS has embarked on poverty mapping that
combines Census and household surveys to estimate poverty for highly disaggregated geographic areas.
Country capacity for poverty mapping and its policy applications are also being enhanced through on-the-
job training for BBS staff and training courses for analysts from BBS and think tanks. The Government
wishes to continue upgrading the capacity for M&E with necessary support from development partners.
The Bank is also expanding its project assistance to BBS. A new subproject for BBS under the existing
Economic Management and Technical Assistance Project (EMTAP) will help design systems to monitor
(a) welfare indicators and correlates o f consumption poverty more frequently, and (b) labor market



                                                      18

 indicators annually rather than the current practice o f every 3-4 years through the Labor Force Survey.
The Bank with assistance from other donors i s also engaged in a broader effort to improve the
information base to informpolicy interventions intended for the poorest. This involves collaborating with
NGOsto collect systematic data and design program evaluations in areas affected by Mongu (a particular
form o f seasonal deprivation).

78.       Looking ahead, the M&E agenda will benefit from improving the policy linkages with poverty
diagnostics. The outcome indicators available from the HIESs can be used to better define longer-term
targets, align policy priorities to these targets, and monitor progress. Once completed (by August-2008),
poverty maps will enable tracking o f poverty and its correlates at the sub-districtlupuzila level, which
would significantly improve the information base for designing policies and safety net interventions for
poor or lagging regions. Furthermore, selecting and consistently tracking a set o f output or intermediate
indicators that (unlike poverty and other outcome indicators) respond readily to policy interventions will
improve the feedback from monitoring to implementation o f specific policies or programs. To move
towards this objective, GED (Planning Division) has gone through an exercise to select a set o f
outputlintermediate indicators that are monitorable and most useful for providing feedback to
implementors. GED has identified about 200 indicators and the relevant ministries have been requested
to provide information on the monitoring mechanism and data for these indicators. This will be finalized
after the second PRS, now under preparation, i s completed.

79.       Overall, the mentioned efforts to strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems provide a useful
opportunity to monitor the outcomes o f the various reforms supported under the TSC. If implemented
successfully, they should further improve the quality o f information and analyses to underpin policy
making and establish a stronger focus on results within the Government.

Credit Administration,Disbursement and Auditing

80.      Recipient o f the credit. Credit Amount, Terms and Tranchinq. The recipient o f the credit i s the
People's Republic o f Bangladesh.       A single tranche Credit o f SDR 121.5 million (US$200 million
equivalent) would be made available upon credit effectiveness, anticipated for June 2008. The closing
date o f the Credit i s June 30,2009.

81.      Disbursement. Proceeds o f the Credit will be disbursed to a specific deposit account o f the
Ministry o f Finance established at Bangladesh Bank for this purpose; the deposit account is part of the
country's official foreign exchange reserves. An amount equivalent to the Credit proceeds will then be
credited to an account o f the Government to finance budgeted expenditures. Transactions and balances o f
the Government account will be fully incorporated into the Government's accounting records and
financial statements. Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases and no procurement
requirements will be needed. If any portion o f the Credit proceeds i s used for ineligible purposes as
definedby the FinancingAgreement, IDA will require the recipient to refundthe amount directly to IDA.

82.      Fiduciary Risk and Audit. Fiduciary arrangements for this operation are no different from the
fiduciary arrangements used for managing the Government's own foreign exchange reserves at the
Central Bank and budgetary resources through the treasury system. While recent assessments o f the
fiduciary arrangements continue to highlighta weak environment, efforts have been made in recent years
to improve the systems, with significant results.

     0   First, a comprehensive reform effort to improve public financial management institutions,
         supported by this operation and parallel technical assistance activities, i s ongoing. This includes
         reforms to improve budget planning, accounting and auditing o f government transactions,
         financial reporting and procurement. Accounting transactions are beingcomputerized to improve



                                                       19

         the accuracy and timeliness o f public financial information. Reconciliation o f budget accounts
         and corresponding bank accounts i s improving and computerization i s being extended to capture
         these transactions.

     0   Second, on the foreign exchange side, the most recent IMF safeguard assessment confirmed that
         progress had been made on strengthening BB's safeguards framework in a number o f areas,
         including through the publication o f BBs financial accounts (according to International Financial
         Reporting Standards), reconciliation o f monetary data reported to the IMF with the audited
         accounts and improvements in foreign exchange management. Starting from FY03, BB has had
         its financial statements audited by internationally affiliated audit firm in full compliance with
         international standards on auditing. The entries o f the Deposit account will, upon request from
         the Association, be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA under terms o f reference
         inaccordance with international standards on auditing.

EnvironmentalIssues

83.      Overall, the policies directly supported by the TSC will not have significant negative effects on
the environment, natural resources, or forests. Many o f the policy actions may, infact, indirectly generate
environmental benefits by reducing pressures on the natural resources and may facilitate the adoption o f
cleaner technologies inproduction sectors, thus leading to better environmental outcomes.

84.      The reform measure to extend the bonded warehouse facility to a wider group o f exporters would
be beneficial for export diversification.      However, authorities would need to ensure that the new
beneficiaries o f the facility are subject to the same level o f environmental scrutiny as the other firms.
Similarly, while the formation o f the Regulatory Reforms Commission to streamline business processes i s
well intentioned, caution would be needed in issuance o f new business licenses to ensure that the
adequate environmental due-diligence is still adhered to, especially if the license is for an
environmentally sensitive sector like chemicals.

85.      The ongoing efforts by authorities to divest public enterprises (`jute mills) could potentially yield
environmental improvements. But there are risks associated with contaminated sites and future liabilities
from the legacy o f pollution. Policies to address issues o f environmental liability for past contamination
and continuingpollution by SOEs undergoingprivatization have been agreed with the Government as part
o f the Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization Project. These policies include provision for the
environmental audit o f potentially contaminated sites prior to sale, although greater attention to
application o f these measures i s needed and the Bank will continue to monitor the implementation.

86.     Nonetheless, the extent o f environmental degradation in Bangladesh poses a substantial social
and economic concern. Analysis in the recently completed Bangladesh Country Environmental Analysis
suggests that policy initiatives to reduce environmental health risks associated with poor water quality and
urban and indoor air pollution could result in economic savings o f as much as 3.5 percent o f GDP. A
number of critical issues regarding environmental health, natural resource productivity, and urban and
industrial pollution have been at the center o f Bank's policy dialogue with the Government and will
remain a strategic challenge o f utmost importance. The Bank will fully support government efforts being
initiated to strengthen adaptation to climate change.


                VII.    POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT OF REFORMS SUPPORTED BY TSC

87.     This TSC operation seeks to strengthen the core institutions o f accountability and deepen policy
reforms to build a stronger investment climate for accelerated growth.          Bangladesh's development
performance in last two decades provides persuasive evidence for assuming that economic growth will


                                                     20

continue to be the main engine o f poverty reduction. In addition, the institutional reforms supported by
TSC over the medium to long run are expected to improve public service delivery by reducing systemic
corruption and increasing the transparency and oversight o f the core governance institutions.

88.       The specific reform measures involving the separation o f the lower judiciary from the executive
and greater institutionalized access to information will improve the dispensation o f justice and
transparency o f public services, especially for the poor.                  Measures to strengthen institutions for
expenditure management such as the promulgation o f the Public Resources and Budget Management
Ordinance will improve both the pro-poor and gender orientation o f the budget. Reforms geared toward
export diversification and improving the regulatory quality are expected to stimulate labor-intensive
manufacturing, as was the case for the garments sector, with attendant positive impact on employment
creation and poverty reduction.

89.       Reforms in administered prices are needed to improve the financial viability o f energy and
fertilizer SOEs-which         account for more than two thirds o f total SOE losses-and                  to improve the
provision o f energy and fertilizer inthe country. Energy and fertilizer subsidies are projected to reach 2.7
percent o f GDP in FYO8. Moreover, being largely non-targeted, there is substantial leakage o f the
subsidies to wealthier households, as shown by a World Bank study in2006 and further corroborated by a
later study by the IMF. Elimination o f these subsidies would generate substantial fiscal space for
expanding social programs. The World Bank and IMF studies argue that targeted transfers using the
budgetary savings to compensate the poor would be a much more efficient way o f protecting them from
higher prices."     Even with reasonable allowances for leakages, the transfer amounts in question are likely
to be relatively small: only 2 percent o f the household expenditure o f the bottom two quintiles (in terms
o f per-capita consumption) is on petroleum products, gas, and electricity.'l              The direct effect o f higher
fertilizer prices on the poor households i s also likely to be small. Fertilizer expenditure accounts for 1.2
percent o f total household expenditure o f the bottom quintile.

90.       These conclusions remain broadly valid even if the indirect effects o f fuel price increases are
taken into consideration. There i s widespread concern, for instance, that higher diesel prices would hurt
agriculturalproductionby making irrigation more expensive. Buthousehold expenditureo f the rural poor
on irrigation-inclusive      o f diesel-is    no more than 3 percent. Similarly, public transport, another indirect
channel o f transmitting higher fuel prices, accounts for only 1.9 percent o f the average household budget
o f the poor. There may also be transmission o f some indirect distributional effects o f higher diesel and
fertilizer prices through their impact on food (particularly rice) prices.                Although hard to quantify
accurately because o f limited information, the impact on food prices i s likely to be small. Fertilizer
comprises about 10 percent o f production cost o f rice while irrigation costs are about 20 percent o f
production cost o f rice in the dry rabi season; moreover, the price o f rice has been increasing rapidly to
the benefit o f the farmers.

91.      Nonetheless, any adverse impact, however small, is bound to be painful for the poor, with
attached political and social sensitivities. Recognizing this, the Government has started to provide Tk 2.5
billion as diesel subsidy through the FY08 budget to compensate poor rice farmers for the increase in
diesel prices that took effect in April 2007. The cash subsidy, to be fully disbursed by May 15 2008, is
being offered to 6.6 million marginal and poor rice farmers with 2.5 acres or less farmland and to those
that grow rice on the same amount o f leased land. Future increases in energy and fertilizer prices would

also promote more efficient use o f these products, discourage smuggling to India and Myanmar, and,
above all, generate significant budgetary savings than can be used to expand social safety programs.


                                        VIII. BENEFITS AND RISKS

92.       Benefits: Weak governance has long been recognized as the principal development challenge
faced by Bangladesh. Problems related to corruption, regulatory uncertainty, crime and disorder, and
distrust of thejudiciary and other institutions o f accountability have been pervasive. The confrontational
nature o f politics and high cost o f election financing have also been damaging. As detailed in this
document, since coming to power in January 2007, the CTG, on its own accord and in response to the
very visible needs o f the citizenry, has boldly pursued a wide-ranging reform agenda to arm the core
institutions o f accountability with clearer mandate, more resources and increased operational autonomy.
At the same time, it has sought to bring about more transparency and accountability among public
entities, reduce systemic corruption to signal a move away from a culture o f impunity, and initiate
recovery o f stolen assets. If sustained, for which broader political buy-inand some early gains visible to
the public would be important, these measures promise to reshape the governance landscape o f the
country in a way that seemed almost impossible not too long ago. Not only is this a major aspiration in
itself, it would also be critical for reviving private sector business confidence, raising income levels and
improving human development. Many o f the critical governance reforms, accordingly, are at the very
heart o f the proposed TSC. Moreover, the reform measures aimed at trade diversification and improving
regulatory quality are also important for stronger economic growth. Finally, the policy dialog under the
TSC on macroeconomic stability has helped inform better policy decisions to confront the various
challenges currently being faced.

93.       PoliticalRisks:It is widely recognized in Bangladesh that smooth political transition would be
essential for the continuation and success o f the reformprogram. Although the election process remains
broadly on track, a number o f associated risks remain. The two dominant political parties, the Awami
League and the BNP, are yet to present a coherent election strategy. An internal feud that surfaced within
the BNP over party leadership has remained unresolved even after a high court ruling on the issue.
Moreover, both parties have demanded that the state o f emergency be lifted or significantly relaxed ahead
o f the elections. The CTG's position with respect to that i s not yet clear. The US, UK, and other major
bilateral development partners are in regular contact with the CTG over the election timetable and remain
positive intheir assessment o f the progress being made.

94.       Sustainability of Reforms: There is understandable concern that the next elected government
may dismantle or undermine many o f the reforms since January 2007. Strong public support would be
pivotal to sustain the gains o f this period. The main assurance on the longer-term sustainability o f the
reforms comes from the broad-based public support these enjoy and from the fact that a number o f key
institutional reforms have been locked-in by government decrees and ordinances, which would not be
straightforward to reverse.      Finally, Bangladesh's robust civil society has broadly supported the
institutional reforms, even contributed to many o f its aspects, and would oppose any reversal by a future
elected government. In light o f the crunch situation faced by the budget, the financing provided by the
TSC would further strengthen the CTG's resolve in continuing with the reforms without having to cut
social expenditure or fuel inflation.

95.      Economic Risks: As noted, the natural disasters in the first half o f FY08 and the unremitting
increases in global commodity prices (fuel, fertilizer, and food especially) have put the economy under
considerable strain. The Government has found itself unable to increase fuel prices since April 2007 and
power since March 2007, while fertilizer price adjustment has been long overdue. This has caused
continued escalation o f losses at the concerned SOEs, draining the Government's own budget and making



                                                      22

worse the already weak financing situation o f the public sector banks that are made to lend to the SOEs.
Now the Government i s taking over the burden o f SOE financing, thus relieving the pressure on NCBs.
The CTG has stated its intent to partially adjust soon some key administered prices to alleviate the
situation. It would be important to make regular revisions after that to stem the losses at the SOEs and
ease the pressures on the budget. The uptake in revenue collection would also provide more fiscal
breathing room. The poor in general have suffered considerably due to the rising food (especially rice)
prices exacerbated by occasional disruptions in availability. Ensuringadequate food availability in the
domestic markets in the coming months and reenergizing competitive private sector participation in the
domestic supply chains would be important. Over the longer run, agricultural productivity growth would
need to pick up, for which the Government's recent efforts to upgrade agricultural research would be
important. Well-targeted support for the poorer segments to protect them from food inflation would
remain a priority area.

96.      Natural Disasters: The events o f the past year are a cruel reminder that Bangladesh is inherently
vulnerable to natural disasters, and the predicted global climate changes would only serve to heightenthis
vulnerability. Nonetheless, good progress has been made on mitigating the macroeconomic and social
impact o f natural disasters and the vulnerability o f the poor. This has been done through a combination o f
policy measures, and improvements in safety net programs, disaster awareness, early warning systems,
shelters and buildingthe capacity o f civil administration. Inaddition, the country's renownedNGOs play
an increasingly important role in disaster prevention, recovery, and relief, enabling the Government to
respond promptly to disasters.      The Government, together with the development partners, has also
prepared a multi-pronged strategy aimed at assisting the long-term mitigation o f natural disaster damage.
In addition, the World Bank, ADB, UNDAC, other specialized UNagencies, and several donor countries
are helping strengthen government capacity to respond to and mitigate future natural disaster damage.
One area o f focus would be improving the current warning signal alerting system to ensure that
communities can better understand the level o f actual risk they face and what they must do to protect
themselves and their livelihoods.

97.     Fiduciary Risks: Fungibility o f funds implies that budgetary resources may be diverted or
misused. The Government, however, has a goodrecordo f allocatingpublic spending to key development
sectors and emergency relief and rehabilitationactivities, as seen inthe context o f earlier natural disasters.
Auditing arrangements, financial management within government ministries, and external oversight by
the C&AG's office are also being strengthened. The new procurement law i s expected to further reduce
the scope for misuse o f budgetary funds in contracting. To enhance the safeguard framework, BB i s
strengtheningits financial management.

                               Annex 2: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1:Reinforce Ownership

The proposed TSC directly responds to the Government's request for support o f its wide-ranging reform program
aimed at tackling weak governance, long identified as the most critical challenge facing the country. There are
some concerns over sustainability o f the reforms being implemented by an unelected government. The main
assurance on this comes from the broad-based public support these enjoy and from the fact that a number o f key
institutional reforms have been locked-in by government decrees and ordinances, which would not be
straightforward to reverse. Bangladesh's robust civil society has also backed the institutional reforms, and even
contributed to many o f the aspects.

Principle 2: Agree upfront with thegovernment and otherfinancialpartners on a coordinated accountability
framework

The FY06-09 CAS was jointly prepared with ADB, DFID, and Japan             -  the major development partners in
Bangladesh - and yielded a comprehensive policy and outcome matrix o f reforms. The CAS put governance at
center stage cutting across two pillars o f the government's PRS-improving          the investment climate and
empowering the poor. The specific reform measures supported under the TSC are embedded in the CAS matrix
and also fully consistent with the priorities o f the PRS.

Principle 3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
Weak governance has long been the foremost development challenge facing Bangladesh. Efforts by successive
elected government to strengthen governance and build effective institutions necessary for a mature market
economy and service delivery have been sporadic. Fortunately, spurred by growing citizen demand, the CTG has
made the fight against corruption and weak governance its topmost policy priority. Accordingly, governance
reforms are at the heart o f the TSC. The CAS had envisaged a series o f Poverty Reduction Support Credits
starting in FY08 under a new elected government. Because o f the changed political situation in the country and
with the tenure o f the CTGbeingprolonged to around two years, a one-off budget-support operation seemed to be
a more appropriate instrument under the circumstances.

Principle4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement
The eight reforms (indicative triggers) that underpin the TSC and the corresponding prior actions are in support o f
the government's reform program that responds to the domestic political and economic priorities and the
3pportunities accorded by widespread public support to a non-elected government to tackle critical and long-
festering weaknesses in its governance functions. With the government truly in the driver seat, the choice before
the Bank and other development partners was to evaluate the efficacy o f the reform program and its consistency
with the country's development priorities and decide whether or not to support the agenda. "Conditionality" in
that sense seemed a misnomer. Nonetheless, the reform actions being supported under the TSC do address the
xitical needs o f the country.

Principle5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducivetopredictableandperformance-basedfinancial
rupport

The last of the series o f four Development Support Credits (DSC) was completed in June 2007. The CTG had
qequested continued budget support in FY08. However, because o f political uncertainty at the time (including
imingofthe elections), the exact scope andtiming o f the next budget-support operation was not negotiatedwhile
:ompleting the DSCs. The Bank had only indicated that it stood ready to provide the necessary support, the
xecise form o f which would be negotiated under appropriate conditions, including some clarity on the political
ransition and continuation o f critical reforms. In early FY08, under conditions that seemed conducive, an
tgreement was reached over a US$200 million one-off TSC for FY08. It was clear then that the CTG's reform
'ocus on governance was appropriate and the TSC would largely support a subset o f that instead o f formulating
iew conditionalities. In addition, continuation o f macroeconomic stability and trade reforms was deemed
mportant for the TSC. The policy matrix in Annex 1 has the agreed reforms and development indicators in that
:ontext. In the first half o f FY08, two supplementals to DSC IV, in the amounts o f US$75 million and US$lOO
nillion, were provided to help Bangladesh cope first with devastating floods and then with a massive cyclone.
