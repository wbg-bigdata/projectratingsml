          STRENGTHENING PUBLIC INFORMATION, MONITORING,
     EVALUATION FOR RESULTS MANAGEMENT IN COLOMBIA (P099139)

                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A.      SUMMARY
1.      On November 1, 2011, the Government of Colombia (GoC) requested a second
restructuring of the Strengthening Public Information, Monitoring, Evaluation for Results
Management Project (the Project). The proposed changes, described in this Restructuring
Paper, seek to: i) modify the Project Development Objective (PDO) to reflect the name of
the new Government agency which will approve the evaluation agenda in the future; ii)
modify some of the activities outlined in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for each
of the Project components: iii) modify the PDO and intermediate results indicators in the
Results Framework Matrix; iv) revise the Project cost per component to reflect the
current circumstances after almost three years of implementation; and v) revise the
funding allocations of the Loan Agreement. The request entails a Level One
Restructuring due to the slight modification of the PDO. The implementation schedule
will remain the same.

2.      A Level 2 Restructuring was approved by the World Bank on September 9, 2010
in response to the Government’s request to revise the funding allocations of Components
1, 3 and 4, in order to accommodate additional need for a significant number of training
events, dissemination activities, and editing and publication of materials. In addition, the
definition of “training? was revised in Section IV, Part A, 2, (a) of the Loan Agreement.

B.     PROJECT STATUS
3.      Since approval in December 2008, the Project has consistently been rated
satisfactory in overall implementation performance and progress towards the
achievement of the PDO, as recorded in the past six Implementation and Status and
Results Reports. Considerable progress has been made for all components, which were
recently supervised during the December 2011 midterm review. The project has
disbursed a total of $5,556,835, and as of May 28, 2012, $2,943,164 remains
undisbursed.

4.      Component 1: Institutional Strengthening for M&E for National and Subnational
Public Investment Projects, has established the standards for collection and classification
of public investment spending by region, supported the production of quality
performance information by subnational entities to assess the performance of their local
development plans, delivered training and dissemination on performance methods and
tools in several national departments and has cultivated participation and interest in the
Colombia chapter of the Latin American and Caribbean Monitoring and Evaluation
Network.

5.    Component 2: Consolidation and Expansion of the use of the National M&E
System, has achieved a high-quality and expanding evaluation agenda, which
encompasses various public administration sectors and programs. Activities in
                                             1
Component 2 have introduced a new monitoring system (SISMEG) as well as a new
system to report and follow up on recommendations from the evaluations.

6.     Component 3: Support for the Development of Local and Regional M&E
Systems, has established progress on the development of the regional strategy which
supports monitoring regional convergence, ensuring coherence between national and
subnational monitoring and developing the culture and institutional capacity for M & E at
the sub-national level.

7.     Component 4: Establishment of Mechanisms to Improve Quality, Relevance and
Cost Effectiveness of Public Information, has supported the National Statistical Institute
(DANE) with the completion of the depuration and reclassification of 1,127 statistical
operations and the formulation of the National Strategic Plan for Statistics (PENDES). In
addition, Component 4 has supported the development of a new methodology for poverty
measurement, which was approved by the Government. New poverty numbers were
disseminated in September 2011.

C.       PROPOSED CHANGES AND APPRAISAL SUMMARY
8.      The proposed changes are to provide more flexibility in use of project funds in
order to avoid future amendments to the Loan Agreement and to reflect new Government
priorities by incorporating new activities related to Open Data and “Sinergia Territoral 1?
and removing activities no longer critical to the achievement of the PDO. The proposed
restructuring would also slightly modify the PDO, as the Government has decided to
replace the authority to approve the evaluation agenda from the Inter-institutional
Evaluations Committee (IEC) to the Economic and Social Council (CONPES).

        Original Project Development Objective (PDO): The project development
         objective is to assist the Government in strengthening its monitoring and
         evaluation system to ensure the availability and production of quality of
         information pertinent to improving the Borrower’s: (i) program and policy design
         by IEC and government entities; (ii) social accountability by the Office of the
         President; (iii) investment planning by DNP; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation
         capabilities, at the local and regional levels.

        Proposed Project Development Objective: The objective of the Project is to
         assist the Government in strengthening its monitoring and evaluation system to
         ensure the availability and production of quality of information pertinent to
         improving the Borrower’s: (i) program and policy design by CONPES and
         Government entities; (ii) social accountability by the Office of the President; (iii)
         investment planning by DNP; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation capabilities, at
         the local and regional levels.
         1
           During the project’s Mid-term review, DEPP presented government’s progress in structuring databases for
         Open Data contained in Sinergia Territorial and SISD (Socio Demographic Indicator System). Progress was
         reported in terms of: i) Inventory databases for evaluations (16 databases available); ii) Manual for the use of
         databases; and iii) Analysis on the initial legal liability for publishing databases. The proposed activities will
         complement the evaluation of public information management and use its findings to prepare a National
         Policy on Open Data to be approved by CONPES.



                                                            2
    Results/Indicators: The Government of Colombia has proposed a comprehensive
    revision of the PDO and intermediate outcome results indicators to ensure
    consistency within the PAD and between the PAD and Loan Agreement, to
    simplify the results framework and to reflect the modifications proposed with this
    restructuring. See Annex 1 for complete details of the modifications to the Results
    Framework and Monitoring table.

   Components: The following components would be modified at the request of the
    Borrower to reflect new Government priorities:

    Component 2: Consolidation and Expansion of the use of the National M&E
    System:

    Subcomponent 2.1- Supporting Institutional Capacity Building: Activities
    related to the improvement of the functioning of the IEC and its technical
    secretariat, the Directorate for the Evaluation of Public Policy (DEPP), will no
    longer be considered part of the Subcomponent due to the fact that the IEC has
    not been operational up to this point of the implementation of the loan, and the
    evaluation agenda is sent to the CONPES for approval. All references to IEC will
    be replaced for CONPES, which has assumed IEC’s responsibilities (Article 229,
    Law 1450, 2011).

    New Subcomponent 2.3 – Open Data Pilots: This new subcomponent will
    support the development and piloting of an open data platform with four
    databases of the DNP. The four database include: i) a database of evaluation of
    Familias en Accion, ii) a database of evaluation of Sistema Generalizado de
    Preferencias, iii) a database of SISMEG (the national monitoring system); and
    iv) a database of socioeconomic indicators (SSID). The subcomponent would also
    provide advice during the preparation of the terms of references of the evaluations
    to ensure that the databases submitted to DEPP are quality controlled and comply
    with the necessary requirements for inclusion in Open Data Colombia. This new
    subcomponent will complement another new subcomponent supporting open data
    policies under Component 4.

    Component 3: Support for the Development of Local and Regional M&E
    Systems:

    New Subcomponent 3.1(d) - Sinergia Territorial: The proposed restructuring
    would include a new subcomponent aimed at supporting the development of
    Sinergia Territorial for the expansion and mainstreaming of M&E to departments
    and municipalities. The Project would support Sinergia Territorial in four main
    areas: i) methodologies; ii) information systems; iii) training; and iv) follow-up
    and verification of the monitoring of regional and local development plans. These
    activities will also help build and implement an M&E system in the territorial
    entities to verify, on an ongoing basis, the implementation of the NDP at the sub-
    national level, as well as the implementation of M&E practices at the local level.



                                         3
    Component 4: Establishment of Mechanisms to Improve Quality, Relevance
    and Cost Effectiveness of Public Information:

    Subcomponent 4.1 - Strengthening the Institutional Framework for the
    Production of Socio-Economic Information: The DNP has requested that the
    Project no longer supports DANE, indicating that this agency needs a much
    larger, integral, stand-alone project to support it. In addition, DNP and the
    Ministry of Technologies and Communications developed a new system of access
    to public information; therefore the activities initially formulated in the PAD are
    no longer applicable in the current scenario. All activities related to COINFO will
    be removed from the Project and the support to public information issues will be
    carried out under a new subcomponent, described below, aiming at strengthening
    the Open Data agenda in Colombia. All activities in this component will be
    limited to supporting the modernization and integration of the information-flow’s
    technical aspects, systems, and delivery channels, by setting common standards in
    the information process of Sinergia.

    New subcomponent 4.1(c): Support for Open Data policy: This subcomponent
    will complement the evaluation of public information management and use its
    findings to prepare a National Policy on Open Data to be approved by CONPES.
    Support will be provided in the preparation of the terms of reference and the
    evaluation design, the hiring a peer reviewer with international expertise and
    experience, the integration of seven CIOs appointed to the evaluation’s committee
    and the review of the delivered products by the consultant who will conduct the
    evaluation and the discussion of the results itself. This activity will serve as an
    input to the development of a CONPES on the Open Data Strategy in Colombia
    and will include expert reviews of the legislative and regulatory projects related to
    Open Data in Colombia.

    Reallocation: The proposed amendment would simplify the disbursement table
    included in the Loan Agreement to provide greater flexibility in the
    administration and management of project funds. The proposed changes entail: i)
    the removal of the “Unallocated? category under which no disbursements were
    made and ii) the addition of a new category defined as “Goods, Training,
    Consultants’ Services, Non-consultant services and Operating Costs?. Please see
    proposed table below and in Annex 2.

   Project Costs: The indicative modifications to funds allocation per component
    are described in the table below.
