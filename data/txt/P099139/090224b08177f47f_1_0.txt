                         restructuring slightly revised the Project Development Objective to reflect the name of the new Government agency, CONPES (Consejo Nacional de Politica Economia y Social),
                         which will assume the role of approving the evaluation agenda. The restructuring also slightly modified: (i) the project activities under each component to reflect new Government
                         priorities, specifically adding support for the open data national policy by supporting the development and piloting of an open data platform with four databases of the DNP and
                         support for the development of Sinergia Territorial for the expansion and mainstreaming of M&E to departments and municipalities; (ii) the project cost per component to reflect the
