INTERNATIONAL DEVELORMT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOM      NDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR A RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Arab Republic of Egypt for the equivalent of
US $30 million on standard IDA terms to help finance the foreign exchange
costs of a railway project, which constitutes Phase I of a Five-Year
Investment Program of the Egyptian Railways (ER) for the rehabilitation
and improvement of the railway system.
PART I - INTRODU CTION
2.        Egypt has received so far a Bank loan of $56.5 million for the
Suez Canal Development Project in 1959 and an IDA credit of $26 million
for the Nile Delta Drainage Project in 1970. The status of these two
operations is shown in Annex I. The implementation of the Nile Delta
Drainage Project has been delayed, initially because of difficulties in
appointing consultants, which have now been overcome, and subsequently
because of the borrower's unfamiliarity with the preparation of bid docu-
ments for international competitive bidding. The Association has assisted
the Egyptian authorities to tackle the latter difficulty, and bids for
some major items of equipment are now scheduled to be opened by the end
of this year. Despite this, the project is nowT likely to bc seriously delayed
in inpor-ontatim, and has been placed undEr close superviision by the Association.
3.        The Nile Delta Drainage Project and the proposed Railway Project
are the results of project identification and preparation work by the
Bank Group and the Egyptian authorities since 1968, when the progress
which Egypt had made in resolving issues relating to the compensation of
nationalized properties and the rescheduling of external debt arrears
opened the way for a resumption of Bank Group operations, as described in
my report to the Executive Directors on the Nile Delta Drainage Project
(P-753 of Novureb_r 5, 1969).  Since then further progress has been
made. Agreements for settling practically all of the claims which arose
out of the nationalization of foreign enterprises in the early 1960's
have now been concluded. The most recent instance is the agreement
concluded in September with the United Kingdom. According to the infor-
mation available to the Bank, discussions on the few remaining cases are
under way and the Government has stated its readiness to find solutions
for them.



4.       There has been further progress in rescheduling the arrears in
debt repayment which had begun to accumulate in 1965/66. When the Nile
Delta Drainage Project was presented to the Executive Directors, agree-
ments to reschedule arrears had been concluded with all countries, except
the U.S0 At that time, discussions between Egypt and U.S, had reached a
stage at which both sides appeared to be very close to agreement. Since
then, considerable efforts have been made by both sides to work out
mutually satisfactory arrangements, and these have now been achieved.
5.       The railways have suffered acutely from many years of under-
investment. Over the last two years, considerable effort has been
expended by the Bank Group in assistinig ER in developing a rehabilitation
program, that would be financially within the country's and ER's capacity.
Negotiations for the project took place in W4ashington from April 1 to 9,
1971. The Egyptian delegation was headed by Mr. Ali El-Nakib, Vice
Chairman of ER.
6.       Egypt is in great need, as explained in Part II below, of
external assistance to maintain even a modest rate of growth. The identi-
fication and preparation of projects in agriculture, industry, transporta-
tion and population are of particular importance. Agriculture, which
contributes nearly 30 percent of the GDP and 60 percent of exports,
besides employing nearly 50 percent of the labour force, is one of the
key sectors. It has prospects for growth and export earnings in the near
future, if appropriate infrastructural investments are made to permit
efficient use of existing lands and open up new areas with the water available
from the High Dam. Industry in recent years has played an increasing role
in Egypt's development. It increased its share of the GDP to 23 percent
in 1970 and has prospects for contributing further to employment and export
earnings. Transportation could become an increasing bottleneck to growth,
particularly with the mounting backlog of investments, as in the railway
system. Egypt faces a serious population problem, with an annual increase
of over 2.5 percent, a high dependency ratio, a scarcity of cultivable
land and significant urban unemployment. The Government has therefore
accorded high priority to an effective program of population planning.
In these circumstances, the projects under consideration for possible Bank
Group financing in the next few years include a drainage project for
Upper Egypt, which is scheduled for early appraisal, and a project for
soil improvement in irrigated and drained areas, which is at an advanced
stage of preparation; assistance is also being given for the preparation
of a population project within the framework of the national population
plan. For the longer run, assistance is being provided in formulating
investment projects in cotton ginning rehabilitation, industrial finance
and urban transport.

7.        IF', has made no investments in Egypt.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
8.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the United Arab Republic" (No. EMA-29a) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on June 9, 1971. A Country Data Sheet is attached
as Annex II.
9.        Egypt is one of the poorest of the larger Middle East and North
African countries with a per capita income of about $165. Between 1960
and 1966 the Egyptian economy achieved a real annual growth rate of 6 per-
cent. As a result of the 1967 war and its aftermath the rate of growth in
1967 and 1968 was negative but with a number of successful stabilization
measures thereafter, the economy regained its momentum and brought about
a real rate of growth in GDP of 6 percent in 1969 and 1970.
10.       Compared to the final 1969 budget results, the 1971 budget pro-
vides for an increase in current revenues of over 22 percent. Despite a
high ratio of tax revenues to GDP (estimated at around 21 percent in 1971),
total government saviings became negative. This is largely due to the
high defense expenditures, estimated at about 19 percent of the GDP in
1971, but other expenditures, especially on education and health, have
also continued to rise more rapidly than currenit revenues and GDP. Public
sector investment, partly financed by external resources, has been of the
order of $700 million a year since 1969, or around 10 percent of GDP in
1971.
110       On the external side, a considerable improvement in commodity
exports and a large inflow of transfers after 1967 (essentially Arab
assistance amounting to LE 110 annually provided by Libya, Kuwait, Saudi
Arabia under the 1968 Khartoum Agreement to compensate Egypt for the loss
of the Suez Canal revenues and expected to continue as long as the Canal
remains closed), brought about an improvement in the balance of payments.
In 1968/69 and 1969/70, Egypt had a small surplus in its balance of pay-
ments. The main contributors to the growth of export earnings were some
expansion of oil production, favorable cotton prices and some increases
in non-traditional exports such as fruit and vegetables. Furthermore,
tighter controls and regulations brought a further reduction in imports.
In the fiscal year 1970/71, however, mounting balance of payments diffi-
culties became evident in a sharp decline of net foreign assets through
June 1971. The growth registered by non-traditional exports in the
previous two years was on the whole not sustained in 1970/71, although
oil exports increased. Imports increased primarily as a result of the
growing needs of local industries for imported raw materials. Khartoum
Agreement assistance was not sufficient to offset the deteriorating trade
balance as in the previous two years. As a result, the balance of pay-
ments shoTis a doficit of $273 r;dllion for fiscal :rear 1970/71, as coripared
to a surplus of $26 milion in 1968/69.



12.      Apart from Arab assistance, the recent inflow of external aid to
Egypt from all sources has been very limited. Indeed, 1969 saw a net capi-
tal outflow, particularly in convertible currencies. Gross disbursements
of foreign loans have decreased from around $300 million in 1967 to about
$200 million in 1969, while amortization payments have increased from
$150 million in 1967 to $230 million in 1969. The persistent shortage of
foreign exchange, and particularly of convertible currencies, not only
poses difficulties for debt service, but continues to be a major constraint
on development as well as on the utilization of productive capacity.
13.      The external debt of Egypt as of December 1970 is estimated to
have been about $1.8 billion of which approximately half was due to
Eastern countries and the other half to Western countrieso Its structure
is quite unfavorable, with nearly two-thirds of it becoming due before the
end of 1975. (This includes 75 percent of the debt due to the West and
58 percent of that due to Eastern Europe and the People's Republic of China.)
The debt service ratio (24 percent in 1971) is high and represents a
serious strain on Egypt's resources in the next three to four years. As a
partial solution, Egypt has been making arrangements to reschedule its
debt obligations to western creditors, as mentioned in paragraph 4 above.
In viewi of its tight foreign exchange situation, Egypt has tried in almost
all rescheduling arrangements to limit the net capital outflow by obtaining
new credits. However, since the new credits available are mostly on
suppliers' credit terms, the net result has been to provide at best some
short-term relief, without resolving the long-run debt problem.
14.      Egypt has a good potential for economic development in all the
major sectors, but growth prospects remain uncertain. In the past,
savings have consistently fallen short of investment needs. Even if
defense expenditures could be reduced, Egypt would still need a substantial
inflow of external resources to finance the investments required to maintain
an adequate rate of growth. Recognizing this, the Government is seeking to
encourage private foreign investment. It issued recently a number of laws
and decrees that offer foreign investors major tax concessions and facilitate
repatriation of profits. The Government has also established the Egyptian
International Bank for Foreign Trade and Development, whose dealings and
accounts will be in fully convertible currencies, to finance Egypt's
foreign trade and to act as an agent for foreign investors.
15.      In view of Egypt's limited ability to service external debt,
the limited resources available for development in relation to those
needed to achieve a moderate rate of growth, the low per capita income
and the need for considerable and continued external assistance, Bank
Group assistance should continue to be provided to Egypt on IDA terms0



PART III - THE PROJECT
Sector Background
16.       Egypt's inland transportation system w-Jhich is concentrated in
the iqile Delta and Valley, comprises roads, railways, inland waterways,
pipelines and airways. Generally, road transport is favored for short-
haul traffic, whereas rail and inland water transport serve long distance
and bulk traffic.  There are some 22,000 km of roads, of which about
9,000 km are paved but only 138,000 vehicles, or 225 inhabitants per
vehicle, and road transport is seriously handicapped by the fact that the
vehicle fleet is poorly maintained and too small. The main inland water-
ways include a 910 km stretch of the River Nile and over 600 km of canals.
At least 3 million tons of cargo are handled in the waterways, including
1.6 million tons of bulk cargo. Inland water transport could play a
greater role for long distance and bulk haulage, but substantial invest-
ments over a long period would be needed.
17.       The Egyptian railway system is mainly a trunk system with 2,600 km
of single and 950 km of double track lines, and the most important long-
distance carrier and transporter of bulk commodities. It also caters to
high-density suburban passenger traffic around Cairo. The system has
suffered from under-investment for over a decade. Due to lack of funds,
ERts physical properties and facilities have been allowed to run down, and
many ar-e obsolete. A substantial part of ER's tracks are in an unsatisfac-
tory condition. The renewal of nearly 1,900 km of main line track is
now overdue and in the interest of safety) speed restrictions had to be
put on several lines. The condition of sidings is even worse, and nearly
75 percent of them are beyond useful life. Most of the marshalling yards
have inadequate capacity and have not been modernized in the last sixty
years. Except in certain small sections, signalling and telecommunication
equipment is obsolete and presents a serious impediment to efficient
operation and management. About one-third of freight and passenger cars
are obsolete and maintenance of other rolling stock is hampered by lack of
spare parts. The maintenance and repair workshops themselves are very
much in need of modernization. It is to the credit of the technical
competence and management of ER, that despite these deficiencies and the
obsolescence of its physical properties, the railway system has been
operated relatively efficiently and has been able to take care of an
increasing volume of traffic.
18.       During the period 1960-70, passenger-km grew by about 6.0 per-
cent per annum and freight net ton-km by about 3.7 percent per annum.
The relatively long distances over which freight traffic must move in
Egypt, and the increasingly large proportion of bulk commodities being
carried, make the railways especially important, and they can be expected
to remain the most important long distance carrier for some time. Further,
the development of the industrial complexes at Aswan and Helwan and the



- 6 -
fertilizer industry at Qena, as well as exploitation of mineral deposits
(especially iron ore, coal, bauxite, manganese and phosphate) will require
substantially increased railway services. However, without major rehabi-
1itation and new investments, the railways would be unable to provide
these services and could become a serious bottleneck to further economic
development.
19.       A Five-Year Investment Program for the fiscal years 1972-76,
which was drawn up by ER in consultation with the Government and the
Association and which is estimated to cost about US $319 million equivalent
(with a foreign exchange component of about US $137 million) ,aims at
breaking the past cycle of under-investment in order to gradually eliminate
obsolescence and deficiencies in ER's physical equipment and enable it to
meet increasing traffic demands. Realizing the urgency of correcting the
prevailing situation, the Government had originally requested ER to prepare
a Five-Year Investment Program, for the period 1970/71 to 1974/75, to
coincide with the Government's planning period. In early 1970, ER prepared
a program estimated to cost SE 217 million ($505 million). Since such a
large program would have required funds far in excess of whiat Egypt could
allocate itself for the railways and the foreign exchange cost exceeded
available and expected external sources, this program was not approved by
the Government. Following discussions between the Government, ER and the
Association, a revised Five-Year Investment Program was preparedp taking
into account the priorities attached by ER to various physical facilities
and equipment in order to have a balanced program, to be executed in two
phases. The Government has agreed that substantial modifications in the
Program would be made only on the basis of agreement between the Govern-
ment, ER and the Association. The Program concentrates on rehabilitation
and essential modernization. It assumes only modest traffic growth and
its justification is evident even in the absence of a comprehensive
transport survey, which in any case would be difficult to undertake in the
present conditions.
The Project
20.       The main features of the Project and the proposed credit are
summarized in Annex III. The Project constitutes Phase I of the Five-
Year Investment Program and comprises all physical investments to be made
in the first two years (FY 1972 and FY 1973), as well as the complete
installation of signalling and telecommunication equipment on three impor-
tant line sections to be completed by FY 1976.
21.       The Project is estimated to cost about $135 million.  The pro-
posed credit of $30 million would cover about 46 percent of the estimated
foreign exchange requirements. Most of the remaining foreign exchange
requirements have been covered by credits already available to ER under
bilateral arrangements with East European countries and suppliers,
credits. The remaining expenditure on the Project will be met from ER's
own resources and loans extended by the Government. Of the materials,



equipment and Sornices to be procured for the Project, the proposed credit
of $30 million would cover the procuremehit of materials required to relay
about 500 Im of tracks, acquisition of 18 diesel-locomotives of 2,200 hp,
airbrake equipment for about 400 freight cars, spare parts to rehabilitate
locomotives and railcars, and electric signalling, interlocking and tele-
communication equipment on three important sections in the railway network,
as well as consultants' services for introduction of a costing system and
training of ER's personnel.
22.       Most of the materials and equipment to be financed by the proposed
credit will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding.
However, for spare parts needed to rehabilitate locomotives and railcars
and for standardized airbrake equipmont for freight cars, wdhich are esti-
mated to cost together about $1.6 million or just over 5 percent of the pro-
posed credit, quotations would be requested from the suppliers
of the original equipment. The engineering and design work, as also the
construction work, is to be done by ER's own personnel.
Organizational and Financial Aspects
23.       ER was operated until 1956 as a government department, at which
time it became an autonomous entity. It is headed by a Board of Directors
of not less than seven and not more than eleven members appointed by the
President of Egypt, and includes representatives of various government
departments and the managers of ER. The Chairman of the Board functions
as the General Manager of ER. The Board has control over operational matters,
but issues of policy, borrowing, staff regulations and rates and fares are
subject to the approval of the President of the Republic. In other words,
major policy decisions, including those on finance and investnent, are
talcen by the Government.
24.       ER's finances are separate from Uhose of Government.  ER has been
earning operating surpluses for several years. However, until recently,
the financial relationship between the Government and the Railways has been
unsatisfactory, in that the Government reserved the right to appropriate
net income, after debt service, without credit or interest to ER. When
ER needed long-term funds, these were usually provided by the Government as
a 15-year loan with interest at the rate of 4.5 percent per annum.
However, earlier this year the Government and ER agreed in principle to
convert about SE 82.5 million of ER's existing debts into Government
equity in ER; this conversion, to be completed by March 31, 1972, would
improve the debt/equity ratio and afford relief to ER. ER will pay to the
Government a fixed annual return of 2 percent on its equity holding.
This fixed return could be increased after consultat-ons between the
Government and ER. ER will retain internally-generated funds for its
investment and other financial needs. The Government and ER have also
agreed to make within six months satisfactory arrangements for the settle-
rient of mutual debts. Furthermore, an acceptable costing system is to be
introduced in ER with the assistance of consultants and the fixed assets
are to be revalued.



- 8 -
25.       The Government has a'so agrced to take steps which would enable
ER to earn an adeauate rate of return on its net fixed assets in operation
which would be not less than 4.5 percent from fiscal year 1974. This per-
centage will be reviewed after the revaluation of assets is completed. ER
has also undertaken to ensure that except as mutually agreed with the
Association it will not incur any debt unless its net revenues in a fiscal
year are at least 1.2 times the maximum debt service requirements for any
succeeding fiscal year, on all debt of ER, including the debt to be
incurred. The various institutional and financial arrangements agreed
upon during negotiations would not only enable ER to generate funds for
the Project and the Program, but also to operate on a sound financial
basis.
26.       The proceeds of the proposed credit would be relent by the Govern-
ment to ER at 4.5 percent interest per annum over a period of 20 years
including about four years grace, under a subsidiary loan agreement satis-
factory to the Association.
Economic Rate of Return
27.       As mentioned in paragraph 16 above, because of the limitations
of the road transport system and the fact that an expansion of the inland
waterway system would take time and considerable investment, it is anti-
cipated that the demands on ER in the foreseeable future for both
passenger and freight traffic, will continue to be heavy. On conservative
estimates, ER's freight traffic will continue to grow annually by 3 per-
cent and passenger traffic by about 2.5 percent. The proposed Program will
not only increase efficiency and safety of operations, but also will
increase ER's capacity to handle a growing volume of traffic. In the
absence of cost accounting and detailed cost studies, the contribution
of individual items in the Five-Year Investment Program cannot be isolated
and quantified. However, by measuring the value to the economy of
increased rail services and reduced operating costs as a result of the
Program, the economic rate of return is estimated to be about 13.5 per-
cent, without taking into account the significant bonefits that will accrue
to railway users in the fonm of imaproved serviccs.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
28.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between Egypt and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and ER,
the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section
1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and the text of
a resolution approving the proposed development credit, are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 9 -
29.       Thie provisions of the draft agreements conform to the normal
pattern for oredits for railway projects. The Project Agreement between
ER and the Association will cover financial arrangements and undertakings
relating to ER's operations.  The execution of this Agreement, as well
as that of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and ER,
referred to in paragraph 26, is a condition for making the proposed
credit effective.
30.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECONVIENDATION
31.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
