APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
SIMMARY
For over a decade, the transport sector of the Arab Republic of
Egypt has suffered from underinvestment and threatens to become a serious
bottleneck in the coiuntry's economic development unless a major rehabilita-
tion and expansion program is undertaken. Recognizing this, the Government
of Egypt indicated that it intends to give priority to improving transport
services and has asked the Association for a credit to help finance the
Investment Program of the Egyptian Railways (ER) for the five-year period
1971/72-1975/76. The amount of the proposed credit has been set at US$30
million equivalent.
ii.       Rail transport in Egypt is the responsibility of the State-oiwned
Egyptian Railways. ER's management is competent and operations are general-
ly efficient. ER's physical properties are run do-n and large parts are
obsolete because of insufficient allocation of *unds over a long period.
The financial relationship between the Government and the Railways has been
unsatisfactory inasmuch as the Govermnent is entitled to take all profits
without credit or interest to ER which, in turn, must borrow needed funds
from the Government subject to repayment and interest. Agreement was
reached during negotiations regarding modification of the financial rela-
tionship between the Government and ER so that ER is able to use its inter-
nally generated funds for meeting its capital investment and other financial
needs.
iii.      ER's passeager and freight traffic has been growing over the
last 10 years and is expected to increase annually by about 30 in freight
and 2.5% in passengers during the period 1970-1980. ERts freight traffic
is largely in bulk traffic, suitable for rail transport.
iv.       Given improved political and economic conditions, the Railways'
future looks promising. The rail network is mainly a trunk system and it
carries freight over relatively long distances. Its position as the most
important long-distance carrier remains largely unchallenged. While
inland water transport. could play a greater part than it does at present,
invesz.ments needed to increase substantially the capacity of the waterways
would require several years to complpe-e, during which taxe the Railways
woulc. 'ave to corntinue to carryr expcted growing traffic volumes. Road
traisnort, - 1cht i3 prseantly hampered be  the scarcity of foreign exchange
anid s-astaxLdara roads i= _z   areas; i.s *sed maostly for short haul traffic
and ER's traf -c is not 1iac6l to s   s_rifiicantly affected by it in the
near future.  In the :uture all these modes 61;ould share in the increased
demnand for transport tha-i would result from an inmprovement in Egypt's
economy.



v.        A comprehensive transport survey would be reauired to determine
the economic role of the various modes of transport and a coherent invest-
ment strategy for the sector. Because of the uncertainties concerning the
future of the economy and the difficulties in making long-term traffic
projections, the survey could not be successfully undertaken at this time.
Nevertheless, the proposed railway project can be justified even without
having the results of such a survey as it aims mainly at rehabilitating the
parts of the system that wlll remain essential for many years.  Moreover, the
justification assumes only modest traffic increases.
vi.       The objective of ER's Investment Program is to gradually eliminate
obsolescence and deficiencies of ER's physical equipment and to provide
additional capacity to meet increasing traffic demands. In discussions
between an Association mission in January 1971, the Government and ER, an
Investment Program for the five-year period 1971/72-1975/76 was prepared
which takes into account the priorities indicated by ER, the needs for a
balanced program and financing which can reasonably be expected to be avail-
able. The Program would involve an investment of US$319 million equivalent
during this period, with a foreign exchange component of approximately US$137
million. The details of the Program have been agreed upon with ER and the
Government during negotiations. Government has also agreed to provide funds
and facilities as requisite to ER for the execution of the Program. It has
been agreed that no substantial modifications would be made in this program
without the agreement of the Association.
vii.      The Project forms the first phase of ER's Investment Program and
consists of all the investments to be made in the fiscal years 1972 and
1973 and the complete installation in the fiscal years 1972 to 1976 of
electric signalling, interlocking and automatic block on two major sections
and of centralized traffic control on a third important line. It is
estimated to cost US$134.3 minllion equivalent with a foreign exchange com-
ponent of US$65.7 million equivalent. The proposed credit would finance
the foreign exchange cost of signalling and telecommunication installation
on the three sections referred to, track materials for renewal of about
500 Ian of track, acquisition of 18 diesel locomotives, air brake equipment
for 400 freight cars, spare parts for existing diesel locomotives and rail
cars and consultants' services and training abroad for certain key ER
personnel.  A substantial portion of the balance requirements of foreign
exchange will be covered by tied and suppliers' credit arrangements that
Egypt has already obtained or negotiated.
viii.     The Investment Program and the Project are technically sound and
justified on economic grounds.  Measures will be taken to improve ER's fi-
nancial position and earn an adequate rate of return, which would be not less
than 4.5% from fiscal year 1974, on the net fixed assets in operation.
ix.       The Project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of
US$30 million. The proposed credit would be made to the Government of the
Arab Republic of Egypt and relent to the Egyptian Railways at 4.5% interest
per annum over a period of 20 years, including a four-year period of grace.



ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
EGYPTIAN RAILWAYS
APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt has asked the
Association for a credit to help finance the Investment Program of the
Egyptian Railways (ER) for the period 1971/72-1975/76. The Program has the
broad objectives of rehabilitating and modernizing ER's facilities. The
Project would consist of the first priority requirements of the Program.
1.02      The proposed credit of US$30 million would finance the foreign
exchange costs of essential goods and services in the first phase of the
Five-Year Investment Program.
1.03      This would be the first Bank Group operation for the benefit of
Egyptian Railways and the second one in the transportation field. The first,
a Bank loan to Egypt of US$56.5 million (243-Egypt of December 22, 1959), was
for widening and deepening the Suez Canal and its approaches, the construction
of additional facilities, and the acquisition of equipment. The project was
satisfactorily completed.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission con-
sisting of Messrs. Lubbeke, McCunniff and Karcher, which visited Egypt in
November 1968, and on information provided by the Egyptian Government and ER.
To update this information, Mr. Lubbeke visited Egypt in June 1969, Messrs.
Lubbeke and McCunniff in October 1969, and Mr. Lubbeke again in July 1970.
The Project was finally determined by a mission to Egypt in January 1971
consisting of Messrs. Jaycox, Lubbeke and Nanjundiah.
2.   BACKGROUND
A.   Egypt and its Economy
2.01      The Arab Republic o  EZgypt lies at the meeting point of three conti-
nents and two seas.  It extends over 1 million km2 of arid and unproductive land,
except for the fertile Nile valley and delta which account for less than 4%
of the country's total area. Almost the entire population of about 34 mil-
lion is concentrated in this small region, where population density reaches
900 per km2 and is among the highest in the world. Population is growing
at an annual rate of about 2.5%.
2.02      Mining, industZr and electricity contribute about 21% to national
product, compared with about 30% for agriculture. Industries based on the pro-
cessing of local materials such as cotton and food products predominate.



From 1965 to 1969, Gross National Product (GNP) grew from about iE 2.0 billion
to about iE 2.3 billion at an average annual rate of 2.9%. By 1969, GNP per
capita was about US$163.
B.   Inland Transportation in Egypt
General
2.03      Inland transportation requirements in Egypt are concentrated in
the Nile delta and along the Nile valley stretching 900 km southward from
Cairo to Aswan. Egypt's inland transportation system comprises roads, rail-
ways, waterways, pipelines, and airways.
2.04      The Government strictly controls the transportation sector and
since it also controls most of the industrial sector as well as interna-
tional trade, it is in a position to allocate directly a substantial pro-
portion of the traffic to the various modes of transport. As a general
rule, road transport is favored for short haul traffic, whereas rail and
inland water transport serve long distance and bulk traffic.
Railways
2.05      Railway organization, property, operations and finances are de-
scribed in Chapters 3 and 5.
Highways and Hi±ghway Transport
2.06      Egypt has some 22,000 km of roads, of which about 9,000 km are paved,
including the only four-lane highway in the country, between Alexandria and
Cairo. Betwieen 1960 and 1967, Egypt's vehicle fleet grew at an average rate
of 6.2% per year, reaching about 138,000 vehicles (225 inhabitants per ve-
hicle). The Government owns and operates four inter-city passenger transport
companies and four road freight companies; its influence is extensive in that
an important proportion of privately-owned trucks are grouped into coopera-
tives under Government control.
Inland Waterways, Maritime Ports and Civil Aviation
2.07      The main inland waterways include the river Nile from Aswan to Cairo
(910 km), two canals between Cairo and Alexandria (220 km and 250 km), and the
Cairo-Ismailiya Canal (133 km). The river Nile allows 900-ton two-barge units
from Aswan to the delta barrage 30 km north of Cairo.  The Government has na-
tionalized the most important inland navigation companies and established two
public companies operated by the Organization for Inland Transport; in 1967/68,
t-hese companies handled 1.6 million tons of mainly bulk cargo at an average
haul of nearly 700 km. Private motor-powered barges account for another mil-
lion tons of cargo, while about 12,500 sailing barges carry substantial ton-
nages.
2.08      The Port of Alexandria handles most of Egypt's dry cargo and maritime
passenger traffic. In 1969, freight traffic amounted to 9.3 million tons, of



which 25% was liquid bulk. The Port of Suez specializes in oil traffic to and
from the refinery located at Suez, while Port Said, the only other major port
in Egypt, catered to Suez Canal traffic before the Canal's closure.
2.09      Egypt operates two State-owned airlines:  United Arab Airlines for
international services and Misrair for domestic flights. Cairo airport accounts
for more than 80% of air-passenger traffic. Internal air freight is still
negligible.
C.   Transport Coordination and Investment Planning
2.10      Ample machinery for transport coordination exists within the Govern-
ment. The Minister of Transport presides over a General Committee for Inland
Transportation, which comprises the Chairmen of all public transport organiza-
tions and is responsible for traffic allocation, rates and fares, investment
planning, etc. This committee is further subdivided into more specialized
subcommittees. In addition, there are executive follow-up commissions to
supervise day-to-day transport operations of main commodities, such as cereals,
sugar and fertilizers, on the basis of available capacity, type of service re-
quired and estimates of transport costs. Transport costs by modes are general-
ly known only by broad averages per traffic unit, without allowance for vary-
ing lengths of haul, loadability, terminal transport and handling, or quality
of service.
2.11      Little attention has so far been given by the Government to overall
transportation policies and investment planning, and a comprehensive long-
term transportation survey is required to determine the future economic role
of the various modes of transport and the investment strategy in the sector.
However, the uncertainties concerning the future of the economy and the dif-
ficulties in obtaining detailed traffic data and making long-term projections
would not permit an early start and successful implementation of such a survey.
It was agreed during negotiations that the Government will, by December 31,
1972, establish and maintain adequate facilities for collecting and processing
traffic and cost data relating to the different modes of transport to assist
the Government in the formulation of overall transport policy and the making
of decisions relating to future investments in this sector.
3. THE EGYPTIAN RAILWAYS
A.   Organization, Management, and Staff
3.01      Egyptian Railways was operated until 1956 as a Government Depart-
ment. In 1956 the Eyptian Railways Organization was established as an auton-
omous entity. It is headed by a Board of not less than seven and not more
than 11 members who are appointed by the President of the Republic and in-
clude representatives of the Ministries of Transport, Treasury, Economy,
Industry and Supply, of the Armed Forces, and the Counsellor of State. The
remaining members are nominated by the Minister of Transport and include one



of the Railways' managers. The Chairman of the Board acts as General Manager
and the two Vice Chairmen as Deputy General Managers, one of them being re-
sponsible for engineering and technical matters and the other for operations
and traffic. The Board controls the Railways' operating and financial poli-
c:ies and decides on all matters referred to it by the Minister of Transport
and the Chairman. The following matters are, however, subject to the approv-
aLl of the President of the Republic: (a) general policy; (b) borrowing; (c)
regulations governing the Railways' staff; and (d) rates and fares.
3.02      The seven managers who report to the Chairman and the Vice Cha4rman
are those responsible for (a) mechanical and electrical eouipment and install-
ations; (b) way and works; (c) planning and follow-up; (d) administration; (e)
finances; (f) operations and traffic; and (g) the central region (around Ca-ro!.
There are 29 divisions which report to the managers and four other regions
which report to the Vice Chairman in charge of operations and traffic. The
Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairmen, and the Management are capable, and
the handling of traffic operations and technical matters is efficient. Th'l
organization appears adequate and the management has a sense of purpose and
a distinct feeling for priority in the face of frequently conflicting rec .re-
ments.
3.03      The total number of staff employed by ER decreased slightly during
the last seven years from 76,881 in 1963/64 to 74,555 in 1969/70, about 3%
(Tables 1 and 2). The efficiency of the staff in terms of traffic units pe-
eraployee has improved during the period from 1963/64 to 1966/67 (the last
year with normal operating and traffic conditions) with the increase in traf-
ffic. In that year the efficiency ratios were 125,000 traffic-units and
214,000 gross ton-km per employee. In 1969/70 the ratio was 130,000 traffic-
untits per employee. These figures, which are low (as compared with India,
Turkey, Belgium, France). indicate slight overstaffing largely due to the
following factors:
(a) a large portion of track relaying still has to be carried
out manually, as only one mechanized plant exists (Annex 1);
(b) the maintenance of worn-out tracks and the repair of obsolete
rolling stock in obsolete workshops require excessive manpower;
(c) due to the continual shortage of foreign exchange, ER must
manufacture parts which other railways are able to import;
(d) almost all construction work is carried out by ER's own work
force.
As ER's investment program aims to eliminate obsolescence, the number of em-
ployees will gradually decrease in the future. However, for the present per-
iod of underemployment in Egypt, it is ER's plan to keep the number of staff
stable and to decrease it later as employment opportunities improve. No
action is recommended at this stage.



-5-
3.04      ER operates satisfactory training facilities at major traffic cen-
ters and in workshops. A new railway training center is being established at
Wardan (50 km from Cairo) with assistance from the United Nations Development
Program. It has been in partial operation since 1969 but has not yet reached
full development.
B.   Railway Property
General
3.05      ER operated in 1966/67 a total of 3,559 route-km, of which 2,608 km
are single track and 951 km double track.  All lines are of standardgauge
(1.g35 m~= -L Pt. 8-1/tin4.  About 7h25 route-km have been closed in the Suez
Canal area and Sinai since 1967. The 25-kn suburban line in Cairo from Bab-
El Luq to Helwan is electrified with 1,500 V/DC.
3.06      ER's physical properties have several deficiencies which are dis-
cussed in the following paragraphs and in Annex 1. Management is aware of
these deficiencies, which will be gradually eliminated with the execution of
the 1971/72-1975/76 Railways Investment Program and subsequent programs.
Track
3.07      A substantial part of ER's track is in unsatisfactory condition.
At the end of 1970/71, a total of 1,905 km of deferred relaying of main track
(42% of the total) had accrued, which necessitates excessive maintenance and
causes frequent minor damage as well as occasional derailments with heavy
damage to locomotives and rolling stock. The condition of sidings is even
worse, with an estimated 75% beyond useful life. ER's capacity to relay track
is 100 km per year by a mechanized plant, and 150 km per year manually (simul-
taneously on several sections), depending, however, on the availability of
funds and particularly of foreign exchange for the procurement of rails,
fastenings, and wooden sleepers. Because of the lack of funds, total track
renewal was only 45 km in 1968/69, 96 km in 1969/70, and less than 100 km in
1970/71. Track recently relaid is satisfactory.
3.08      ER considers the relaying of about 1,250 km of track the first
priority item included in the 1971/72-1975/76 Investment Program. During
that period, an additional 550 km will have surpassed its useful life. Thus
the accrued balance of deferred renewal at the end of 1975/76 will still be
about 1,205 km of track, which cannot be eliminated before 1985 if, beginning
in 1971/72, track renewal progresses at the rate of 250 km of track per year,
as planned.
Other Property
3.09      Marshalling Yards.  There are five large yards and eight smaller
yards. All of them are flat shunting yards and none has been modernized in
the last 60 years. The condition of the yards is poor and the capacity of
most of them is inadequate.



3.10      Signalling and Telecommunications.  A modern Central Traffic Control
System (CTC) was installed in 1963 on a single track section of the main line
to Upper Egypt between Assyout and Sohag (90 km). The line from Cairo/Bab-El
Luq to Helwan (25 km) is equipped with electric signalling and automatic
block. All other lines and stations are equipped with obsolete mechanical
signalling and interlocking. ER's local telephone systems are generally
adequate. ER has no long distance telephone lines of its own, which presents
a serious impediment to successful operation and management.
3.11      Motive Power and Rolling Stock.  The composition of ER's motive
power and rolling stock 1963/64-1969/70 is shown in Table 3. The ER system
has been almost fully dieselized since 1963. While most of the diesel loco-
motives and railcars and electric railcars are relatively new, about one-third
of the passenger and freight cars are obsolete (Annex 1). Table 4, which
gives details of the type, age, and capacity of ER's freight cars, shows that
about 65% of the freight cars have a capacity of less than 20 ton, which is a
serious impediment for efficient operations and freight handling. Mainte-
nance of diesel locomotives is recurrently impeded by lack of spare parts.
Long distance railcars are well maintained. Short distance and commuter rail-
cars and rail buses are run down because of continuous overcrowding (para. 3.15)
and insufficient repair facilities. Maintenance of the older passenger and
freight stock is kept at the minimum needed.
3.12      Maintenance and Repair Facilities.  There are seven main workshops,
two of them obsolete and two with insufficient space and equipment, and sev-
eral regional shops for maintenance and running repair of diesel shunting
locomotives, railcars in short distance traffic, and rolling stock. The
regional shops are converted former steam locomotive sheds. Their facili-
ties are by and large adequate but need modernization.
C.   Operations
3.13      The ER system has a high density of passenger traffic, which in
1969/70 averaged 2.1 million pass-km per route-km in operation. The average
density of freight traffic in 1969/70 was relatively smaller, 1.1 million
ton-km per route-km in operation. ER is generally efficiently operated in
spite of several deficiencies of its physical properties (paras. 3.06-3.12
and Annex 1).
3.14      Table 2 gives a summary of operating statistics for the years
1963/64-1969/70. Traffic volumes and efficiency ratios varied because of
abnormal traffic conditions: (a) 1963/64 was the peak year of heavy traffic
of construction materiaLs to the Aswan Dam; and (b) traffic has been affected
since 1967 by the closing of 347 route-km east of the Suez Canal and of 54 km
west of the Suez Canal. Nevertheless, the traffic in the remaining systems
increased substantially in 1969/70, which caused serious problems for opera-
tions because of poor availability of motive power and rolling stock and
obsolete fixed installations.



3.15      The utilization of diesel locomotives and diesel and electric
railcars fluctuated but was generally satisfactory (Table 2). The average
availability of diesel main line and shunting locomotives (Table 3) fluc-
tuated because of recurrent shortage of spare parts. It was satisfactory
from 1965/66 to 1967/68, but deteriorated again in recent years. To improve
the availability of the existing fleet of diesel locomotives and railcars,
procurement of spare parts for maintenance and unit replacement from the
original manufacturers are included in the Project. The less satisfactory
availability of diesel railcars, particularly light diesel railcars for
suburban and short distance traffic, and the high number of failures of
electric railcars were caused by heavy overcrowding of the vehicles, which
are not sufficiently powered for the actual load. This is reflected by the
extremely high average seat occupancy factor in suburban traffic of up to
0.87 pass-km per seat-km (Table 2) which can be reached only by about 300%
occupancy during the rush hours in the direction of traffic flow. ER plans
to remedy this situation by: (a) procurement of 25 additional electric
railcar sets for the Helwan line; (b) improved maintenance of the railcar
stock; and (c) gradual replacement of the underpowered diesel railcar sets
in suburban and short distance traffic by locomotive hauled trains with high-
er capacity.
3.16      The occupancy factor of 0.41 to 0.45 for other than suburban pas-
senger traffic is normal. ER operates efficient long distance passenger
service with air conditioned diesel railcar sets between Cairo, Alexandria,
and Aswan. The average turn-around time of freight cars fluctuated from 7.6
days in 1966/67 to 6.2 days in 1967/68 and to 7.0 days in 1968/69. A de-
crease should be possible when track, marshalling yards, and other factors
improve.  The average speed of freight trains improved during the period
from 14.8 km/h in 1962/63 to 26.4 km/h, because of an increasing number of
trains consisting only of special cars with continuous air brakes. The un-
satisfactory utilization of freight cars (11.8 net ton-km per loaded car-km,
Table 2) is not only caused by the high percentage of cars of less than 20-ton
capacity in ER's fleet, but also by the kind of commodities carried. The
utilization improved in 1968/69 to 14.0 net ton-km per loaded car-km because
of ER's policy to procure mainly freight cars of 40-ton and more capacity
and to retire obsolete and small cars.
D.   Traffic
Freight Traffic
3.17      Traffic rose sharply from 8.6 million tons in 1960/61 to a peak of
14.4 million tons in 1963/64. Sand and cement movements for the construction
of the High Dam at Aswan accounted for much of this increase; in 1963/64 such
movements totalled over 3.5 million tons. The completion of major earthworks
at the dam site largely accounts for the decline of traffic to 11.6 million
tons in 1969/70 (Table 5).
3.18      In tonnages, as well as in ton-km, the most important commodities
are mine products, building materials, petroleum products, sugarcane, cereals,



- 8 -
fertilizers, and coal; they represent about two-thirds of the total freight
traffic, but contribute only half of the revenue receipts (Table 6). Between
1963/64 and 1969/70, the average length of haul for commercial traffic ranged
from 256 km to 296 km (Table 5). Miscellaneous traffic, which in 1966/67
accounted for 23% of the ton-km and 40% of the receipts, moved over average
distances as high as 390 km, underlining the Railways' important role in
conveying comparatively long distance freight traffic. Average receipts per
ton-km of commercial traffic increased from 4.64 mm in 1963/64 to 5.69 mm in
1969/70; this is mainly attributable to a reduced proportion of low rated
bulk commodities to total traffic.
Passenger Traffic
3.19      Passenger traffic showed a steady growth except in 1967/68 when war
conditions and tariff increases produced a marked slowdown (Table 7). From
-:963/64 to 1969/70, passengers increased at an annual rate of 6% and pass-km
at 3.7%. Some 20% of the pass-km is on suburban services in the Cairo and
Alexandria metropolitan areas. The average journey for commuters is about
9 km; for passengers on main lines and branch lines, it is about 98 km and
23 km, respectively.
E.   Rates and Fares and Costing
3.20      ER has only limited control over tariffs, and the sanction of the
President of the Republic is required to amend them. The general tariff
applies to most traffic; with Board approval, however, ER may quote special
rates. Actually, tariffs have been remarkably stable, and except for an in-
crease in passenger fares of about 20% in August 1967, they have remained
unchanged since 1957, when surcharges of 50% to 120% were added to the 1930
lasic rates.
<.21     Freight is divided into 11 classes; the ratio of the highest rated
to the lowest rated commodities is 10:1. High rated commodities include
fragile or dangerous freight, such as house furniture and explosives. At
the other end of the scale are either low valued bulk commodities, such as
mine products and coal, or high priority goods such as fertilizers and ex-
ports. Rates allow for loadability and length of haul, and discourage short
haul and parcel traffic. In the absence of detailed cost accounting, it is
not possible to determine whether tariffs properly reflect costs.
3.22      Passenger fares vary with each type of train, namely, express, pas-
senger, and suburban trains, and with the class of service (air-conditioned,
first, second, and third). The railways offer reduced fares to numerous
categories of travelers, such as students, commuters, Government employees
,nd their families, religious and charity groups, and military personnel.
Lacking detailed cost studies, it is not possible to ascertain the extent of
subsidization of various services.



- 9 -
3.23      There is need to introduce a costing system.  The assistance of
consultants would be required to expedite installation of the procedures and
utilization by management of the data provided. This matter was discussed
during negotiations. It was agreed that ER would, by March 31, 1973, intro-
duce a costing system to determine the costs of the services provided by
ER. For this purpose, ER would employ consultants satisfactory to the
Association on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association. In
addition, some key ER personnel would be trained abroad. The foreign ex-
change costs of consultants' services and of training ER personnel would be
financed under the proposed credit.
4. THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A.   ER's 1971/72-1975/76 Investment Program
4.01      Lack of funds over a long period has resulted in increasing defi-
ciencies and obsolescence of ER's physical properties (paras. 3.05-3.12 and
3.15 and Annex 1). The Government realized the urgency of correcting these
conditions and of increasing ER's capacity to meet expected traffic demands,
and accordingly requested ER in 1969 (a) to prepare a five-year Investment
Program for the 1970/71-1974/75 period (which was later postponed by one
year because of shortage of funds) and (b) to include in it items which could
not be carried out in previous programs because of lack of funds, as, for
example, improvement of workshops and marshalling yards, and measures to im-
prove commuter services in the Cairo suburban area.
4.02      The Program prepared by ER in 1970 was estimated to cost, including
contingencies, BE 217 million (US$505 million equivalent, of which US$235
million was in foreign exchange). The cost of this large Investment Program
substantially exceeded the funds that could be reasonably expected to become
available during the period and was not approved by Government. Particularly,
it would have been impossible to cover the foreign exchange cost from avail-
able and expected sources.
4.03      From discussions in January 1971 in Cairo between the Government,
ER, and the Association, a revised Investment Program was prepared, the
financing for which can reasonably be expected to be available from inter-
nally generated resources and borrowings. The total cost of the Program is
LE 137 million (US$319 million equivalent with a foreign exchange cost of
about LE 59 million (US$137 million equivalent)). The composition and cost
of the Program are shown in detail in Table 8 and summarized below:

The composition of the Program and the provision of funds for the items fit ER's
needs for a balanced program keeping also in view the priorities attached by the
Egyptian Railways. The details of this Program were discussed and agreed during
negotiations. Government has also undertaken to provide the requisite funds and
facilities, etc.for ER to carry out this Program.



4.04      Estimated local costs are reasonable.  The foreign exchange esti-
mates were adjusted in accordance with the results of ER's most recent
tenders.
4.05      ER's 1971/72-1975/76 Investment Program would represent a substan-
tial increase in the rate of investment, from an average of about BE 8 mil-
lion (US$19 million) per year over the 1967/68-1969/70 period to BE 27.4
million (US$63.8 million) in 1971/72-1975/76, and would enable ER to break
the past cycle of under-investment. However, the present Program takes into
account both the limitation of available funds and practical physical limit-
ations such as in the case of track renewal and installation of airbrakes
on freight cars, and there would therefore be need for a subsequent invest-
ment program beginning in 1976/77.
4.06      While ER's 1971/72-1975/76 Investment Program appears physically
manageable, it still would require substantial assistance from the Govern-
ment and borrowing from external sources in excess of that undertaken in
recent years. The financial aspects are discussed in Chapter 5.
B.   Description of the Project
4.07      The Project forms the first phase of ER's 1971/72-1975/76 Invest-
ment Program; it consists of all investments to be made in the fiscal years
1972 and 1973 and the complete installation in the fiscal years 1972 to
1976 of electric signalling, interlocking and automatic block on two sections
and of centralized traffic control (CTC) on a third; all three sections are
of highest priority. It is estimated to cost about LE 58 million (US$134.5
million) including contingencies (Table 9). The Project consists of the
following parts:
(a) Complete installation of electric signalling, interlocking
and automatic block on Cairo-Kobri El Leimoun-El Marg-Gabal
El Asfar and Cairo-Giza and Ausim sections and of CTC on
the Sohag-Nag Hammadi section (including necessary track
modifications).
(b) Completion of the already started work on the installation
of electric signalling, interlocking and automatic block on
the Cairo-Qualyub section and commencement of work for elec-
tric signalling, interlocking and automatic block on the
Qualyub-Benha section; modification of mechanical signalling
installations and introduction of tokenless block in some
sections; and installation of automatic telephone network on
ER's system.
(c)  Relaying of about 400 km of track with 52 kg/m rails and about
100 km of track with reconditioned rails (about 260 km on main
lines in Upper Egypt, about 160 km on main lines in Lower
Egypt and about 80 km on other lines in the Delta); acquisition
of mechanized track laying and maintenance equipment; and
stabilization of embankments and construction/renewal of
buildings and structures.



- 12 -
(d)  Acquisition of 18 diesel locomotives of 2,200 hp, 25 diesel
locomotives of 1,000 hp, 25 electric rail car sets, together
with spare parts for all preceding items, five breakdown cranes
or other rerailing equipment, about 270 passenger coaches and
about 300 freight cars; installation of air brakes on about 400
freight cars, and improvement in train lighting.
(e)  Modernization or construction of marshalling yards, including
the new central marshalling yard for the Cairo area, either
at Qualyub or at Ausim; remodelling of station facilities and
yards.
(f)  Reconstruction of workshops for passenger coaches at Cairo-Bulaq
and for freight cars at Gabal El Zeitoun; modernization of the
locomotive workshop at Cairo-Bulaq and other workshops; recon-
struction and improvement of running sheds for passenger coaches
at Abu Ghatis and for rail cars at Kobri El Leimoun; and the
construction of a new running shed for diesel rail cars at El
Farz.
(g)  Acquisition of road vehicles, reorganization of stores facil-
ities and augmentation of stocks of essential stores including
spares, improvement of electric power supply on the Helwan
line, training center facilities, training abroad of key per-
sonnel of ER, and employment of consultants for the introduction
in ER of costing procedures.

4.09      The proposed Credit of US$30 million would finance the foreign
exchange cost of:
(a)  Signalling and telecommunication equipment and installation
on the (Cairo) Kobri El Leimoun-El Marg-Gabal El Asfar and
the Cairo-Giza and Ausim sections, and CTC equipment and in-
stallation on the Sohag-Nag Hammadi section:
(b)  Track materials for the first two years (1971/72-1972/73)
for the relaying program included in the Project;
(c)  18 diesel locomotives of 2,200 hp;
(d)  Airbrake equipment for about 400 freight cars;
(e)  Spare parts for ER's existing fleet of diesel locomotives
and rail cars;
(f)  Consultants' services for establishing a cost accounting system
at ER; and
(g)  Training abroad of ER key personnel.
The low price contingency of 3% on the items to be financed by the Credit
is considered adequate in view of the fact that all of these items will be
tendered immediately and for the most part be delivered within a short per-
iod of time.
4.10      ER has submitted to the Association a detailed program for relay-
ing of track which is summarized in paragraph 4.08, item 3, and Annex 1.
Agreement was reached during negotiations with the Borrower and ER that no
substantial changes will be made in the Railway Investment Program (includ-
ing the track relaying program) except by agreement with the Association.
C.   Execution of the Project
4.11      ER is responsible for carrying out the Project and is competent to
do so. All civil engineering works of the Project and the Program will be
carried out by ER's own work force. Contracts for goods and services (except
Consultants) to be financed out of the proceeds of the Credit will be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding, with the exception of the
contracts totalling about US$1.6 million equivalent for (a) airbrake equip-
ment and (b) spare parts for ER's existing fleet of diesel locomotives
and rail cars. Spare parts needed to rehabilitate out-of-service locomotives
and rail cars have to be obtained from the original suppliers of that equip-
ment, and airbrake equipment has to be obtained through direct negotiations
because of the need for standardization.
D.  Financing of the Project
4.12      The foreign exchange cost of the Project, amounting to US$65.7
imillion equivalent, would be covered by the proposed IDA Credit of US$30.0
million equivalent and foreign suppliers' credits already arranged to the
extent of US$21.9 million equivalent, foreign suppliers' credits expected



- 15 -
to be arranged for about US$6.1 million equivalent, and the balance from
Goverrnment's own resources. The Railways' internally generated funds
would cover approximately US$44.5 million equivalent or about 33% of the
total Project expenditure.
E.   Disbursement Schedule
4.13      The portion of the Credit allocated for signalling and telecom-
munications (US$7.6 million) is expected to be disbursed, generally in
rising installments, from the third quarter of fiscal year 1972 to the
second quarter of fiscal year 1976. Allocations for track material, loco-
motives, airbrakes, spare parts and consultants' services are expected to
be disbursed mainly during fiscal year 1973, with final disbursements in
the first quarter of fiscal year 1974. It is assumed that the unallocated
amount of US$0.9 million would be disbursed pro rata with the other dis-
bursements. The disbursement schedule is shown in Table 10.
5. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Relations with Government
5.01      The Egyptian Railways, which was constituted in 1956 by Presi-
dential Act 366 as an independent organization, not subject to the adminis-
trative and financial regulations of Government departments, has not act-
ually enjoyed any substantial measure of financial independence. A
separate budget, attached to the general budget of Egypt, was provided, and
Government remained the Railways' banker. A fixed return of 2% per annum
on the Government capital investment in ER, from out of the profits, was
prescribed, but Government reserved the right to appropriate net income,
after debt service, without credit or interest to the Railways. The Rail-
ways accounts show that Government exercised this right on some occasions
and such appropriations totalled LE 5.9 million on June 30, 1970. For
purposes of replacing assets and for other investments, Railways borrowed
from the National Productive Budget (Treasury) until 1962/63 and there-
after through the Central Bank at 4.5% interest for a term of 15 years;
in addition, relatively short term foreign suppliers' credits were utilized.
5.02      The need for Government to define its policy with regard to the
appropriation of Railways' profits so that ER could utilize its internally
generated funds for its Investment Program was discussed by the appraisal
mission with the Minister of Treasury, This question was also discussed
during negotiations and it has been agreed that ER would pay only the fixed
annual return of 2%, if necessary payable on a cumulative basis, on Govern-
ment investment in ER (or as altered by Government in consultation with ER)
and that ER could utilize its internally generated funds for meeting its
financial needs including a reasonable portion of its capital investments.
The Government has also agreed that the present outstanding loans to ER,
other than foreign loans and suppliers' credits, i.e., Treasury loans and
loans through the Central Bank, would be converted by March 31, 1972



- 16 -
into Government investment in ER. This would afford considerable relief to
ER with respect to its debt service obligations and enable it to undertake
the Investment Program.
5.03      Payments for Railways services performed for Government depart-
ments and public sector enterprises, which are charged normal commercial
rates by ER, have not been prompt. The accumulated obligations amounted on
June 30, 1970 to about BE 38 million, over half of which were amounts owed
to ER by the Ministry of Defense which has made only part payments to ER.
Cn the other hand, the Railways frequently failed to pay debts and dues,
and owed the Government about BE 28 million on June 30, 1970. Other small
amounts are also involved in this mutual debt and dues problem. Following
discussions by the appraisal mission with the Minister of Treasury, a special
committee was set up with representatives of the Treasury and the Railways
to look into this matter. This question was discussed during negotiations
and agreement was reached that the Government would, within six months, make
satisfactory arrangements for the settlement of the outstanding amounts. It
was also indicated that sufficient provisions would be made in the 1971/72
and subsequent budgets of the entities concerned for this purpose. Measures
would also be taken for prompt settlement of future transactions.
B.   Earnings and Finances
Actual
5.04      The income accounts for each of the last six years 1964/65-1969/
70 are given in Table 11 and summarized below, in BE millions:
1964/65  1965/66  1966/67  1967/68  1968/69  1969/70
Operating Revenue         36.0     39.4      41.7     37.7      37.7     44.9
Working Expenses        22.2     24.4      25.1     24.8      27.1     31.5
Depreciation             4.9      4.3       4.8      4.8       7.0      7.0
Operating Expenses        27.1     28.7      29.9     29.6      34.1     38.5
Net Operating Revenues    8.9      10.8      11.8      8.1       3.6      6.4
Interest                   1.5      1.3       1.5      1.6       1.6      2.1
Net Income                 7.4      9.5      10.3      6.5       2.0      4.3
Operating Ratio %         75.3     72.8      71.7     78.5      90.4     85.8
5.05      During this period, ER was able to fully cover its operating ex-
penses (including depreciation); the rate of return on recorded net fixed
assets at cost varied from a high of 8.3% in 1966/67 to a low of 2.4% in
1968/69 - it improved to 4.3% in 1969/70. The results for 1967/68 and 1968/
6'3 were less favorable than in the earlier years on account of the reduced
fleeight traffic following the completion of the major earthworks at the Aswan
Dam site, reduced passenger traffic in 1967/68 and the war conditions, and
the loss of some route miles and some equipment since June 1967. There was
a significant increase in both passenger and freight traffic in 1969/70 which
is reflected in the income account, and the reduced operating ratio.



- 17 -
5.06      Balance sheet data as reported by ER for the five years 1964/65-
1968/69 are set forth in Table 12. An analysis of the 1967168 accounts,
which was made by the Association staff, indicated the need for the adjust-
ment and restatement of current assets, current liabilities, fixed assets,
long-term debt, other liability and surplus. The necessary adjustments were
made by the Association staff as explained in Annex 2. The adjusted figures
are shown in the first column of Table 13 which also shows the position for
1968/69 and for 1969/70 after similar adjustments by ER. The current and
liquid ratios during these years have been satisfactory. The debt/equity
ratio of 51/49 in 1969/70 would improve by the conversion of some loans into
Government investment in ER (para. 5.02).
5.07      The outstanding long-term external debt of ER on June 30, 1970
consisted of IE 8.5 million of foreign suppliers' credits. The present
practice of capitalizing interest on suppliers' credits in some cases was
discussed during negotiations and it was agreed that the practice should be
discontinued in the future and interest charges separately stated and charged
to interest expenses in the income accounts.
Future Prospects
5.08      The future earnings and financial projections have been prepared,
keeping in view the expected growth of traffic, the Investment Program now
decided upon, conversion of outstanding Treasury and Government loans chan-
nelled through the Central Bank into Government investment in ER and use of
internally generated funds by ER to meet its investment and other financial
needs (para. 5.02). It has also been assumed that the Bahariya Oasis Line
(which is now under construction and is expected to be in operation during
1973/74) would be worked at cost by the Railways, for the Ministry of
Industry, and there would therefore be no net revenue accruing to the Rail-
ways on account of this line. The principal assumptions on which the fore-
casts are based are set forth in Annex 3. Fixed assets have been taken on
the basis of present values, and the results of revaluation (para. 5.16
following) have not been anticipated.
5.09      The estimated income accounts are in Table 11, balance sheet data
in Table 13, and cash flow data in Table 14. The income accounts are sum-
arized below in LE million:
1970/71  1971/72  1972/73  1973/74  1974/75  1975/76
Operating Revenue         46.0      47.8     49.5      52.6     55.0      57.1
Working Expenses        32.3      33.1     34.1      35.0     35.8      36.5
Depreciation             7.2       7.6      8.0       8.7      9.4      10.0
Operating Expenses        39.5      40.7     42.1      43.7     45.2      46.5
Net Operating Revenue      6.5       7.1      7.4       8.9      9.8      10.6
Interest                 2.9      0.7       1.3       2.3      2.8       3.6
Net Income               3.6       6.4      6.1       6.6      7.0       7.0
Operating Ratio %         85.9      85.2     85.1      83.1     82.2      81.4



- 18 -
5.10      The forecast above indicates that the operating ratio would pro-
gressively improve to 81.4% in 1975/76. The reduction of interest charges
in 1971/72 compared with 1970/71 reflects the conversion of some loans into
Government investment in ER (para. 5.02). The times interest earned ratio
would be no less than. 2.9 during the period 1971/72-1975/76. ER would be
able to fully meet its obligation to make payment of the 2% fixed return on
Government investment from its net income.
5.11      In the preceding forecast, it has also been assumed that any in-
creases in costs to the Railways (by increases in wages and prices of mat-
erials) would be compensated by appropriate measures, including tariff
adjustments, so that ER does not have to absorb the impact of rising costs
to the detriment of its financial position. Agreement was reached during
negotiations that the Government and ER would take, from time to time, all
necessary measures (including, but not limited to, adjustment of the tariff
structures and rates) as shall be required to enable ER, out of internally
generated funds, to meet debt service requirements, to maintain adequate
TJorking capital and reserves for contingencies, to pay the fixed return to
Government and to finance a reasonable proportion of its capital expenditures,
including the replacement of assets. It was agreed during negotiations that,
to achieve this objective, the Railways should earn an adequate rate of
return on the value of net fixed assets in operation, which should be not
less than 4.5% commencing from 1973/74; the preceding forecast indicates
that this can be achieved. The rate would be revised, if necessary, by
mutual agreement between the Association and ER when the assets of ER are
revalued (para. 5.16 following).
5.12      The Investment Program for the period 1971/72-1975/76 involves a
substantially higher level of investment than in the past and, keeping in
view ER's likely internally generated funds, there would be a need for sub-
stantial borrowings by ER from Government (through the Central Bank) and
from external sources including some foreign suppliers' credits. (Government
has not decided upon any equity contribution toward the Investment Program.)
Further borrowing may also be required for investments after 1975/76. In
order that the quantum and terms of such loans are such as to enable ER to
maintain a reasonable relationship between net cash revenue and debt service
requirements, the question of debt limitation was discussed during negotia-
tions. It has been agreed that ER would obtain the Association's agreement
before incurring any debt if the net cash revenue of ER for the fiscal year
or for the 12 consecutive months immediately before the date of incurrence,
whichever is greater, shall be less than 1.2 times the maximum debt service
requirement for any succeeding fiscal year on all debt of ER, including the
debt to be incurred.
5.13      Finances, as reflected by the projected balance sheets, Table 13,
would be satisfactory.  The least favorable current and liquid ratios would
be 7.3 and 3.5, respectively. The debt/equity ratio would go down in 1971/
72 to 12/88, mainly because of the conversion of local loans to Government
investment in ER, and would rise gradually thereafter to 29/71 in 1975/76,
on the basis of assumptions in Annex 3.



- 19 -
5.14      Cash flow estimates, Table 14, would be satisfactory.  The aggre-
gate cash flow data for the Investment Program period 1971/72-1975/76 have
been rearranged below to show the proportion of the Program expected to be
financed by internally generated funds, the Association credit and by other
borrowing. The latter consist of loans through the Central Bank and sup-
pliers' credits.

The Railways' internally generated funds would cover 35.3% of the
Investment Program, in addition to other cash needs.  This is satisfactory.
C.   Accounting, Budgets and Auditing
5.15      The Railways' accounting system is structurally sound.  It is gen-
erally patterned after that prescribed for private commercial railroads i:n
the USA. There are deficiencies in its applications, particularly with res-
pect to balance sheets (Annex 2). It was agreed during negotiations that
ER would strengthen its accounting department by the addition of at least two
qualified accounting personnel.



- 20 -
i, t6     The fixed assets of ER need to be revalued since (a) the statements
of assets on the basis of costs, included in the revaluatLon exercise of 1957
(details of which are given in Annex 4), were in many cases estimates of costs
ade in 1957 and (b) the valuation now shown on the balance sheet does not
reflect the value of land (which is excluded from property accounts). That
assessment did not determine the replacement cost or the present value (as
of June 30, 1957). This matter was also discussed during negotiations and
it was agreed that ER would, by June 30, 1973, revalue its fixed assets in
accordance with sound valuation principles for Railways operation, satis-
factory to the Association, and have its auditors report ithereon.
5.17      A budget is prepared by the Railways for (a) operations and (b)
capital investments. It is independent of the Government budget of Egypt, but
forms a separate unit attached to the general budget. Expenditures are sub-
jiect to the direct supervision of the Treasury through internal auditors.
To exceed budget figures, prior authority must be obtained by decree, but
this has not adversely affected railway operations.
5.18      ER's accounts are audited by the Government Central Organization
for Accounting and Auditing. There have been long delays between the close
of the fiscal year and completion of audit. This matter was discussed dur-
ing negotiations and it was agreed that ER's accounts and financial state-
ments would be audited in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the
Association, by qualified personnel appointed by the Central Accounting and
Auditing Organization, to which they would submit their report for approval.
The audit reports would be furnished to the Association within six months of
the close of the fiscal year.
6. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A, Traffic
6.01      Between 1963/64 and 1969/70, total Railways' freight traffic de-
clined from a peak level of 14.4 million tons to 11.6 million tons. However,
excluding sand and cement movements for the construction of the High Dam at
Aswan, other traffic fluctuated around 11 million tons during that period.
The Railways forecast that freight traffic will grow at an average annual
rate of 5.4% between 1970 and 1978 up to a level of 17.5 million tons. Given
the unsettled conditions in the Middle East and their effect on Egypt's economy,
the forecast growth rate was scaled down for the purposes of this analysis
to about 3.0%, which appears more realistic (Table 15).
6.02      In addition to increased freight traffic on the existing system,
the Railways forecast movements of iron ore from new mines located at Baha-
riya in the Western Desert to the steel plant at Helwan. The sixfold expan-
sion of the Helwan plant and the construction of a 340-km railway line to
the Bahariya mines, which the Ministry of Industry is financing with assist-



- 21 -
ance from the Soviet Union, are in progress. By 1973/74, the Railways ex-
pects movements of 1.8 million tons of iron ore from the Bahariya mines to
Helwan, as well as 500,000 tons of short haul limestone and dolomite traffic.
These traffic volumes would double by 1975/76.
6.03      Over the 10-year period ending June 1970, passenger traffic in
terms of pass-km grew at an average rate of 6.0% annually. The events of
1967 and the subsequent fare increase caused traffic to fall by over 12%
in 1967/68 from its previous year level, but the upward trend resumed in
1968/69 and continued in 1969/70. Over the 1970-1980 period, passenger
traffic is forecast to grow at an average annual rate of 2.5% (Table 16).
6.04      Given improved political and economic conditions, the Railways'
future looks promising. Its position as the most important long-distance
freight carrier remains largely unchallenged. While inland water transport
could play a greater part than it does at present, investments needed to
increase substantially the capacity of the waterways would require several
years to complete, during which time the Railways would have to continue to
carry expected growing traffic volumes. In the long run, however, inland
water transport should play a greater role in the movement of bulk traffic.
Road transport, which is presently hampered by the scarcity of foreign ex-
change and below standard roads in some areas, is used for short haul traf-
fic mainly and ER's traffic is unlikely to be significantly affected in the
near future.  In the future all these modes should share in the increased
demand for transport that would result from an improvement in Egypt's economy.
B. Economic Benefits
6.05      The most important items in the Railways' 1971/72-1975/76 Invest-
ment Program of about US$319 million equivalent concern ordinary and deferred
track renewals, improvement of train control and signalling, purchase of new
rolling stock and parts for replacement, modernization, and increase of the
fleet, as well as the remodeling of workshops and completion of stores. The
Program is designed to enhance the efficient operations of the Railways by:
(a) reducing present operating costs;
(b) increasing the Railways' capacity for carrying traffic; and
(c) improving service levels and safety.
6.06      The emphasis of the Program is on achieving greater carrying capac-
ity and safety, while at the same time keeping new investments to a level
compatible with severely limited resources. Insufficient allocations for
track renewals over the past 30 years have produced a dangerous situation.
By June 1971 the backlog of track renewals will amount to about 1,905 km.
Because track is worn out, safety requires that trains run at lower than
normal speed which, in turn, restricts line capacity and increases operating
costs. The consequences are particularly serious on heavily trafficked main
lines. With the help of mechanical equipment, the Railways expects to relay
about 250 km of track annually. This will be a continuing program, in which
priorities will be determined according to prospective traffic volumes and



- 22 -
physical condition of the track. Similarly, the improvement of train traf-
fic control and the electrification of signalling on the most important lines
aim at increasing these lines' capacity without resorting to the doubling of
lines.
6.07      The procurement of new locomotives and rolling stock will enable the
Railways to replace over-age equipment with more modern types, better suited
to present-day traffic requirements, as well as to expand the fleet. To im-
prove the servicing and availability of locomotives and rolling stock, the
Program provides for the construction and remodeling of workshops and for the
procurement of new repair equipment and spare parts. Generalizing the use of
air-brakes on all passenger and goods cars will increase operating speeds of
trains as well as improve safety.
6.08      In addition, some items in the Program, such as the construction of
training centers and laboratories for research and material testing, will pro-
vide benefits over the medium and long run in improved staff efficiency and
operations.
6.09      It is clear that in the absence of cost accounting and detailed cost
studies, the particular contribution of each item to the Program's over-all
benefits cannot be isolated and quantified. Moreover, each item depends on
the implementation of others to yield maximum benefits for the Railways and
the economy. A conservative assessment of that part of the total economic
benefits that is likely to accrue to the Railways in the form of increased
net revenues gives an economic rate of return of about 13.5% on the Invest-
ment Program (Annex 5 and Table 17). This incremental financial analysis
gives a conservative estimate of economic return to Egypt in that a substan-
tial part of the benefits will accrue directly to railway users from improved
services in the form of increased consumer surplus. No attempt has been made
to quantify these difficult-to-measure but nonetheless substantial economic
benefits.
7.  AGEEEENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
of Egypt and ER on the following principal items:
(i) ER's Investment Program for the period 1971/72-1975/76,
and Government commitment to provide the requisite funds
and facilities for carrying out the Program (para. 4.03);
(ii)  Modification of the financial relationship between the
Government and ER to enable ER to use its internally
generated funds for meeting its capital investment and
other financial needs (para. 5.02);
(iii) Financial targets for ER (paras. 5.11 and 5.12);



- 23 -
(iv)  Introduction of costing procedures in ER (para. 3.23);
and
(v) Measures to collect and process traffic and cost data
for various modes of transport required for formulation
of overall transport policy and investment planning
(para. 2.11).
7.02      The Project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of
US$30 million. The proposed credit would be made to the Government of
the Arab Republic of Egypt and relent to the Egyptian Railways at 4.5%
interest per annum over a period of 20 years, including a four-year period
of grace.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
EGYPTIAN RAILWAYS
Details Concerning Status and Condition of Railway Property
1.   The Network
The ER system consists of a dense network of main and branch lines
in the Nile Delta and only one 896-km main line from Cairo to Aswan with a
few short branches (see maps). The lines east of the Suez Canal (347 km)
have been out of operation since June 1967. Traffic on the El Ferdda-Port
Said line (58 kn) is restricted. A new 340-km single track line from Helwan
to the Bahariya Oasis in the Western Desert is under construction. In 1966/
67 there were 4,510 km of main track and about 2,700 km of sidings, i.e., a
total of about 7,200 km of track.
The maximum speed on the Cairo-Alexandria line is 130 km/h; on
the Cairo-Aswan line it is partly 100 km/h and partly 90 km/h. There are,
however, extended temporary speed restrictions down to 60 kn/h because of
poor track condition. The maximum speed on secondary lines is 30 to 80
km/h according to the track condition. The maximum axleload on main lines
is 22 tons.
2.   Track
The poor condition of about 42% of main track and of more than
75% of track in station yards is one of the many serious problems of ER.
Therefore, the 1971/72-1975/76 Investment Program includes as a first prior-
ity item the relaying of about 1,250 km of track.
Prior to 1960, the standard rail was 46 and 47 kg/m, 12 m long,
laid on creosoted pitch pine or oak sleepers, or on steel sleepers. The
new standard rail for main lines is 52 kg/m, 18 m long, laid on lines with
heavy traffic either on concrete or creosoted wooden sleepers, and on sec-
ondary lines on steel sleepers. Rails, fastenings, and wooden sleepers are
imported; concrete and steel sleepers are manufactured locally. Since 1957,
good basalt and granite ballast from ER-owned quarries have been used for
ballasting of main tracks, instead of desert gravel as before. For relaying
track with new rails on concrete and wooden sleepers, a modern mechanized
plant has been used since 1966. Its capacity is 100 km of track relaying
per year, which, however has not been fully utilized until now, because of
insufficient supply of imported track materials due to shortage of forcig.b
exchange. In addition, relaying of tracks on wooden and steel sleepers and
with second-hand materials is performed manually at an annual rate of up to
150 ki.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
The accrued total of life-expired main track was 1,905 km at
the end of 1970/71. As, during the five-year period of the 1971/72-1975/76
Investment Program, an additional 550 km will become life expired, the ac-
crued balance of deferred renewal at the end of 1975/76 will still be 1,205
km. Assuming that the relaying of track will continue after 1975/76 at the
rate of 250 km per year, the accrued deferred renewal may be eliminated by
aLbout 1985. Thereafter, renewal of main track should continue at the annual
rate of life-expiry, which is about 130 km of track, and the balance of
track renewal capacity (120 km to date) could be devoted to renewal of track
in station yards.
ER's 1971/72-1975/76 track relaying program comprises the follow-
ing items:
Line                                 Track-km
Cairo-Alexandria                                     58

Tanta-El Mansura                                      59
(Alexandria)-Sidi Gaber-Rasheed                      44
Other lines in the Delta                            345
Alexandria-Marsa Matruh                               52
Total                                   1,249
The execution of track relaying is planned according to the follow-
ing schedule:

The expected decline in the output of the mechanized track laying plant in
1972/73 and 1973/74 is caused by the planned relocation of the assembly yard
from El Minya to a station near Cairo.



ANNEX I
Page 3
3.   Marshalling Yards
The two most important marshalling yards in the ER system are El
Farz for the Cairo area and El Quabari for the Alexandria area, both with
1,000 outgoing cars per day. In addition, there is an auxiliary marshall-
ing yard for the Cairo area at Bulaq El Dakrur, two yards for the Delta at
Tanta and Zagazig with 600 outgoing cars per day, and eight smaller yards
with 300-400 outgoing cars per day. None of the yards has been modernized
in the last 60 years. While the facilities of the eight smaller yards are
generally adequate for the level of traffic, the major yards are obsolete,
causing excessive shunting hours and standstill of cars, and temporary con-
gestion of lines. The situation in the Cairo area is particularly bad be-
cause of the obsolescence and insufficient capacity of both El Farz and
Bulaq El Dakrur. ER plans to construct a new and modern marshalling yard
for the Cairo area between Qualyub and Ausim. The Project involves the con-
struction of a new bridge across the Nile. The Government objects, however,
to this location of the new marshalling yard because it would utilize a sub-
stantial area of fertile agricultural land in the over-populated Delta. The
best alternative solution would be a location of the yard near Ausim on the
left bank of the Nile. In this case, only a single-track connection would
have to be constructed between Ausim and Qualyub.
In addition, ER plans the modernization of the obsolete El Qua-
bari yard, which is expected to get more traffic from the increasing traffic
of the Port of Alexandria. Minor modifications are planned for other yards.
ER's 1971/72-1975/76 Investment Program includes BE 8.7 million (US$20.3
million equivalent) for these works. A substantial improvement of ER's
operating efficiency can be expected, once the new yard at Qualyub or at
Ausim and the modernization of the El Quabari yard and of the other yards
are completed.
4.   Signalling and Telecommunications
The majority of lines in the ER system are equipped with mechanical
signalling and interlocking, electric block instruments on double track lines,
and token block on single track lines. Most of these installations have re-
mained unchanged for more than 50 years. Supplementary electrical interlock-
ing is being installed on double track main lines, and tokenless block on the
120-km single track Embaba-Itai El Barud section of the so-called desert
line between Cairo and Alexandria, and the 203-km single track Luxor-Aswan
section in Upper Egypt.
Modern signalling installations exist, or are being installed, as
follows:
(a) electric signalling and automatic block on the double track
(Cairo) Bab El Luq-Helwan line (25 km);



ANNEX I
Page 4
(b) Central Traffic Control (CTC) on the single track Assyout-Sohag
line (90 km); and
(c)  CTC between the Cairo Terminal and Qualyub (15 km).
Modern installations, of which the first three are included in the
proposed IDA Credit, are planned as follows:
(d) electric signalling and automatic block on the (Cairo) Kobri
El Leimoun-El Marg-Gabal E1 Asfar line (14 km);
(e) electric signalling and automatic block on the Cairo-Giza
section with the branch to Ausim (15 km);
(f)  CTC on the single track Sohag-Nag Hammadi section (88 km);
and
(g) electric signalling and automatic block on the double track
Qualyub-Benha section (35 km) and the Alexandria-Sidi Gaber
section (about 10 km).
The execution of the foregoing items would substantially improve the effi-
ciency and safety of ER's operations. However, item (g) cannot be completed
during the 1971/72-1975/76 period.
The main deficiency of ER's telecommunication system is the lack of
railway-owned telephone lnes between junctions and major traffic centers.
Consequently, ER has to place telephone calls from center to center at the
Post-Telegraph and Telephone (PTT) exchanges, which are congested, and urgent
messages may be delayed for hours.  Therefore, installation of an automatic
railway telephone network over the whole system is included in the 1971/72-
1975/76 program. Works have already started and will be completed by 1973.
A system of dispatcher and traffic control lines was installed in the Cairo
region in 1961 and is working satisfactorily. Similar systems are being
installed in the four other regions.
5.   Motive Power and Rolling Stock
The ER system is fully dieselized except for the electrified Helwan
line and an isolated steam operation on the Armant line in Upper Egypt, mainly
for seasonal haulage of sugar cane. Diesel locomotive maintenance is gener-
ally satisfactory, although recurrently impeded by lack of spare parts, due
to insufficient allocation of foreign exchange.  Of the 388 diesel main line
locomotives, 376 are either built by General Motors or equipped with General
Motors engines. This alleviates maintenance and spare parts supply.
Long distance diesel railcars are well maintained. However, diesel
and electric railcars for short distance and commuter traffic and rail buses
are run down because of continuous overcrowding of these underpowered cars,



ANNEX 1
Page 5
lack of spare parts, and, for diesels, because of insufficient repair faci-
lities. Maintenance of the older passenger and freight stock is kept at the
very minimum needed to preserve it in running order. Particularly, the
older second and third class passenger stock is run down as a result of con-
tinuous overcrowding and limited maintenance. There are about 300 passenger
cars with wooden bodies which are expensive to maintain and unsafe in case
of an accident.
A summary of the ER fleet by age groups follows:
Percentage of the Total Fleet with the Age of
Up to           11-20        21-35        Over

Freight cars and vans             22             16           28           34
Details of the type, age, and capacity of the freight cars are shown
in Table 4.  The main deficiencies of the freight car stock are:
(a) about 50% of the cars have a capacity of less than 15 tons;
(b) about 30% are older than 40 years and due to be scrapped;
(c) about 70% have no continuous brake (vacuum and/or air);
(d) about 40% have chain coupling which cannot be tightened
because of the absence of screws and therefore cause
substantial surging and slack action of the cars during
braking and starting of the train;
(e) about 30% have obsolete and unsafe bumpers.
On the other hand, several hundreds of cars, recently procured for the trans-
port of minerals, grains, etc., have automatic coupling and air brakes. It
is now ER's policy to procure in the future only freight cars of a capacity
of 40-ton and more (except for cattle wagons).
The planned procurement of motive power and rolling stock under
ER's 1971/72-1975/76 Investment Program is summarized in the following:



ANNEX 1

(a)  diesel locomotives
45 locomotives of 2,200 hp for main line service; 25 locomotives
of 1,000 hp, of which 15 units will be used to substitute ob-
solete and underpowered diesel railcar sets by locomotive hauled
trains and 10 units for heavy shunting operations in marshalling
yards; 25 shuntIng locomotives of 400 hp;
(b) freight cars (total 1,938 cars)
(i) local manufacture
168 brake vans

(ii) imports
250 third class

85 brake and luggage vans
430 total
(d)  five breakdown cranes of 75-ton capacity
Since the few manufacturers specialized in heavy railway
cranes connot deliver cranes which fit in ER's clearance
gauge (which is narrower than the European standard clear-
ancez Tiithin the time required, ER is considering the pur-
chase of heavy hydraulic lacks for rerailing of locomotives



ANNEX 1
Page 7
and cars. These jacks can be delivered within a short
time; they are less expensive than heavy cranes but less
efficient.
ER is undergoing a transition from vacuum to air brake. The diesel
locomotives are equipped with both systems. Recently procured passenger cars
for express trains are equipped with air brakes and, in addition, with vacuum
pipes and hose couplings, so that express passenger trains can be operated
with both systems. All freight cars procured since 1960 are equipped with
air brakes. In addition, ER plans to equip, within 10 years, about 10,000
cars which are in satisfactory condition and less than 30 years old with air
brakes, and all other cars with air pipes and hose couplings to enable con-
tinuous braking. By the end of 1969/70, 1,000 imported air brakes were
installed by ER's workshops. In the future, air brake equipment will be
manufactured in Egypt under a license agreement with the original supplier to
save foreign exchange cost. The manufacture of air brake equipment is under
the responsibility of the Minister of Industry; however, at present, there
is no factory in Egypt sufficiently equipped for the manufacture of air brake
equipment. The procurement and installation of machine tools and the train-
ing of staff would take about two years, so that manufacture could not start
before 1974/75. Since the installation of air brakes in freight cars is
essential for the safety and efficiency of ER's freight train operations,
the Minister of Transport agreed that for the intermediate time about 400
sets each should be imported in 1972/73 and 1973/74. A sufficient number
of sets for installation in 1971/72 are still in ER's stock. Accordingly,
foreign exchange costs for the import of air brake equipment are. included
in ER's Investment Program for 1972/73 and 1973/74, of which the first lot
will be financed from the proceeds of the proposed Credit.
6.   Repair and Maintenance Facilities
There are seven main workshops in the ER system, as follows:
(a) Cairo-Bulag, for major repairs and overhaul of diesel
main line locomotives and diesel railcar engines; the
shop is well run and efficient, and has sufficient
facilities, some of which are still awaiting completion
because of lack of funds; there is, however, no more
space and capacity available for additional diesel main-
line locomotives for desert operation on the Bahariya
Oasis line;
(b) the shop next door to (a) at Cairo-Bulag for major repairs
and overhaul of passenger cars, including body work for
diesel railcars; the shop and its equipment are obsolete
and the facilities are overcrowded; therefore, a substan-
tial part of work has to be done outdoors on a makeshift



ANNEX 1
Page 8
basis which is very inefficient; an extension of the sheds
was started in 1965, and remodeling and modernization of
the existing parts were planned; however, the construction
came to a standstill because of lack of funds;
(c) Gabal El Zeitoun (near Alexandria) for overhaul and repair
of regular freight cars; the shop was constructed about
1900, and has not been essentially modernized since that
time, except for some machinery; it is obsolete, very
crowded, and inefficient and accounts, in part, for the
poor condition of ER's older freight car stock;
(d) Abu Zaabal, for production of all sorts of spare parts and
overhaul and repair of diesel shunting locomotives and
special freight cars; the shop was constructed as a steam
locomotive shop and converted after dieselization into a
production shop; it includes a well equipped foundry, forge
and machine shop which are able to produce even such parts
as cylinder liners for diesel engines to save foreign ex-
change for imports; the shop is well run and efficient;
(e) Tura, for overhaul and repair of the 25 electric railcar
sets of the Helwan line; the shop is well equipped and
efficient; it would need expansion to handle the 25 addi-
tional sets for the Helwan line, and any further additions;
(f) El Farz (near Cairo), for maintenance and running repairs
of all diesel main line locomotives and diesel railcars in
long distance traffic; the shop has quite modern facilities
and is efficient; a slight expansion of the running repair
section is necessary as the number of locomotives is in-
creasing; and
(g) Tanta (in the Delta), for maintenance and light repairs
of diesel railcars.
There are several regional shops for maintenance and running
repairs of diesel shunting locomotives, railcars in short distance traffic,
and passenger and freight cars. Most of these shops are converted former
steam locomotive sheds. Their facilities are by and large adequate but
need some modernization. In addition to the shops mentioned in the fore-
going, ER operates an electrical shop at El Farz for maintenance and repair
signalling and telecommunication equipment and appliances.



ANNEX 1
Page 9
ER's 1971/72-1975/76 Investment Program includes the following
provisions to modernize and improve its maintenance and repair facilities,
which are reasonable:
(a)  Cairo-Bulag, shop for diesel locomotives and diesel
railcar engines; the modernization of this shop will
be completed;
(b) Cairo-Bulag, shop for passenger coaches and railcar
bodies; the shop will be reconstructed; coach repair
will be shifted after 1976 to a new shop, and Cairo-
Bulaq will be used thereafter only for railcar repair;
(c) Gabal El Zeitoun, this obsolete freight car shop will
be completely reconstructed at the same site;
(d) the existing running sheds in the Cairo station, Abu
Ghatis for coaches, and Kobri El Leimoun for diesel
rail buses will be reconstructed and modernized;
(e) El Farz, new running shed for diesel railcars will
be constructed, and the existing shed would service
only diesel locomotives;
(f) equipment and machinery for other running sheds.
A new workshop for the diesel locomotives and iron ore hopper
cars of the Bahariya Oasis line will be constructed at El Tibeen near

Explanation of Changes Made by Association in
Railways 1967/68 Balance Sheet
(BE Million)
1.           Assets                   Railways           Association Staff
Total Current Assets               61.9                     46.3
Non-Current Receivables              4.5                    14.2
Deferred Assets                      -                       5.9
Total                              66.4                     66.4
(a) Analysis of accounts receivable, recorded at BE 23.7
million, indicates that some BE 13.2 million represents
Government accounts owed to the Railways for services
rendered from 1958 to 1965, and commercial accounts of
Government-owned firms outstanding from 1960 to 1966,
amounting to BE 6,9 million. This totals BE 20.1 million.
Of this, BE 5.9 million has been shown separately as a
deferred asset as it represents surplus appropriated by
Government and disputed by the Railways, which wants it
returned; the balance, BE 14.2 million, has been added
to non-current accounts receivable.
(b) The non-current accounts receivable as recorded, BE 4.5
million, should be collected within 12 months and has
been transferred to the current accounts receivable,
bringing the total to LE 46.3 million (61.9 less 20.1
plus 4.5).
(c) As shown in Table 12, fixed assets are on the basis of
net figures at the end of the prior year less annual
rather than accumulated depreciation. Fixed assets have
been restated on a gross basis, less accumulated depre-
ciation and net fixed assets. There has been no change
in the net fixed asset figure.

183.4                   183.4
(a)  Current liabilities have been reduced by two amounts:
first, LE 23.7 million long overdue to Government but
unpaid; and second, LE 5.7 million old suspense items
without claim. These amounts, LE 29.4 million, have
been added to Non-Current Accounts Payable.
(b) Long-term debt has been increased by LE 3.4 million
suppliers' credits, credited to surplus in error, in
the Railways 1967/68 accounts.
(c) The Railways figure of LE 31.9 million, "Other Liabili-
ties," includes (i) LE 23.1 million paid from surplus
by the Railways for capital investments up to 1962/63;
(ii) BE 4.4 million of so-called "frozen assets" or
assets which on June 30, 1957 were not serviceable and
which had exceeded their estimated service life, which
therefore the Railways claim should have been excluded
from capital; and (iii) LE 4.4 million made up of
USAID and other funds, the Government treatment of
which as railway loans has long been disputed by the
Railways.
Item (i) of (c) above (LE 23.1 million) has been transferred to
railway surplus except for LE 5.9 million (representing railway surplus
appiopriated by Government), which has been transferred to deferred liabili-
ties since the appropriation by Government has been resisted and disputed by
the Railways. Items (ii) and (iii) have been transferred to deferred
liabilities for much the same reasons.
The adjusted balance sheet for 1967/68 is shown in the first
column of Table 13.

Principal Assumptions on Which the Financial Forecasts Are Based
The financial projections are based on the following principal
assumptions:
1. The traffic forecast is discussed in paragraphs 6.01 and 6.03.
2. Bahariya Oasis line operations are excluded, as under present arrange-
ments this line is to be operated at cost by ER for the Ministry
of Industry.
3. Constant 1970 prices for goods and services are assumed.
4. Adjustment of rates and fares will be made to offset increases in
prices for goods and services in the years 1970/71 through 1975/76.
5. Government will take appropriate action to convert, by March 31, 1972,
the Treasury and Central Bank loans to ER, amounting to about
LE 82.5 million, into Government investment in ER, which will there-
fore total LE 117.5 million.
6. Only a fixed return of 2% on Government investment will be paid by ER
out of its profits; ER will be allowed to utilize its internally gen-
erated funds to meet its capital investment and other financial needs.
ER would make a modest contribution to liquid reserves beginning 1971/72.
7. Mutual debts and dues will be progressively settled.
8. There will be no change in the basis of recording fixed assets, that is,
original cost, which excludes land, until all assets can be revalued.
9. Straight-line depreciation related to costs will be adopted.
10. Tariff adjustments will be made from 1973/74 onward to yield additional
revenues indicated in Table 11.
11. After assets have been revalued, further assessment will be made period-
ically of the Railways' rates, earnings and finances to ensure an ade-
quate return and cash generation related to the Railways' financial
needs from time to time.



ANNEX 3

12. In any future suppliers' credits transactions, interest will not be
capitalized but separately stated and charged to interest expense in
the income accounts.
13. Suppliers' credits will be utilized to cover the foreign exchange
needed to procure 25 diesel locomotives 1,000 hp, 25 diesel shunting
locomotives 400 hp, 5 breakdown cranes, 25 electric train sets, 900
freight cars, 430 passenger coaches, some plant and equipment costing
approximately BE 1.4 million, and equipment for modification of
electric power supply to Helwan line and completion of the Cairo-Qualyub
electric signalling; the terms would be five years at 8%, no grace
period for credits totalling LE 11.5 million which are expected - for
the balance of WE 1O.4 million credit now arranged, the terms negotiated
have been taken.
14.  The proposed Association credit of US$30 million (BE 12.87 million)
will be relent to ER at the current rate of 4.5% for a period of
20 years including a four-year grace period.
15.  A possible external borrowing by Egypt of bE 12.87 million will also be
relent to ER on the same terms as in 14 above.
16. Other foreign exchange needed, not covered by the above arrangements,
will be made available by Government, with the Railways reimbursing
the Government in local currency.
17. Other borrowings will be made through the Central Bank at the current
rate of 4.5% for a period of 20 years including a four-year grace
period.

Summary of 1957 Revaluation Results
The Revaluation Committee of 1957 initially assesseFd .she b<o-k
value of all items of railway property, as of June 30, 1957, at FE F6,.l
million. The Committee's report indicated that some LE 65.7 millior.
was the cost of assets acquired through the Railways annual bwlgets and
that BE 20.6 million represented assets obtained from loans and -tber
sources.  It was further reported that by applving straight-line depFre-
ciation, the cost of assets on hand amounted to LE 57.7 million, of which
LE 4.9 million represented assets not in serviceable condition.  The ,ork-
mittee then initially fixed the total net assets at BE 53.0 million As
follows:
UE Million
Assets in Service                      52.8
Scrapped Materials                      4.9
Cash and Accounts Receivable            9.0
Sub-Total                         66.7
Less Accounts Payable                  13.7
Railways Capital                       53.0
It was thereafter decided that the scrapped materials repre-
sented idle capital and should be excluded from capital until sold and
converted to cash. Included, however, in the BE 52.8 million Indicated
above were certain assets acquired for emergencies with Government fundsG
available for general purposes amounting to BE 4.7 million, and assets
bought through the National Production Budget amounting to BE 11.6 million,
a total of BE 16.3 million. An agreement was then concluded between the
Minister of Communications and the Minister of Treasury to eliminate this
BE 16.3 from capital, provided it was converted to loan capital repayable
over 15 years beginning in 1962/63 and bearing annual interest only on
the BE 11.6 million part at 3%. As a consequence of the agreement, also,
the Government's equity capital was rounded to bE 35.0 million, subject
to annual fixed return of 2% when earned. Interest on the BE 11.6 millicn
and amortization on the LE 16.3 million were paid only in 1965/66 and
1966/67.

Economic Evaluation of the Railways' Investment Program 1971/72-1975/76
The economic benefits accruing from the Railways' Investment
Program are measured by the value to the economy of increased and improved
rail transport services and of reduced transport costs. Thus, railway
traffic and costs of rail transport must be estimated under alternative
assumptions - i.e., with and without the investment program.
For obvious difficulties of estimation, only those economic
benefits which accrue to the Railways in the form of increases in net
operating revenues have been quantified; the following assumptions
have been made:
(i) the projected traffic (Tables 15 and 16) consists of
passenger and freight movements for which the Railways
is the most economical mode of transport;
(ii) the traffic forecast is realistic, but would only
materialize if the Investment Program is carried out;
without the proposed investments, rail traffic would
decrease by 4% annually from the level forecast for
1970/71 until 1977/78 and level off thereafter;
traffic thus lost by the Railways would either move
by other modes at higher incremental transport costs
or stop moving;
(iii) without the Investment Program, unit operating costs
(excluding depreciation) would increase annually by
say 4% until 1977/78 and level off thereafter;
(iv) the improvements in the Railways' net operating revenues
(before depreciation) could not be achieved without the
investment program; accordingly, they represent the
share of economic benefits of the Investment Program
which will accrue to the Railways from reduced operat-
ing costs and increased traffic;
(v)   the average economic life of the proposed investment is
about 25 years;



ANNEX 5
Page 2
(vi)   the Railways' financial costs (excluding depreciation)
represent true economic costs, assuming that taxes paid
by the Railways are compensated by subsidies and/or
services received from Government.
Based on the above assumptions and on the financial forecasts
given in Table 11, the share of economic benefits which accrues to the
Railways would yield a rate of return of about 13.5% on the proposed
1972-1976 Investment Program (Table 17). This rate of return understates
the actual returns to the economy, since it does not account for the
benefits which accrue directly to railway users from improved services
in the form of increased consumer surplus. Although even more difficult
to quantify than benefits accruing to the Railways, they are not negligible.
