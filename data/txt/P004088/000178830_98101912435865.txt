1. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Contribution to the Economy
1.01      Since the early 1960's, manufacturing has been the fastest growing
sector in the Korean economy. Over the last five years, its growth reached
nearly 17% p.a., almost twice as fast as the 10.3% growth of aggregate GNP.
The industrial sector, which accounted for 12% of GNP in 1961, reached 38.4%
in 1978. Manufacturing contributed 42% of the increment in GNP over the last
decade rising slightly to 44% during the past five years. Manufactured
products represented about 90% of commodity exports in 1978, compared with
82% in 1965 and 60% in 1960. Industry has provided about one half of all
jobs created since 1963; with approximately 3.9 million people employed, the
industrial sector accounted for 28% of the total population employed in 1978
against 13% in 1966.
1.02      Manufactured exports have been the principal engine of growth of
the Korean economy and the beneficial impact of the orientation towards
labor-intensive exports can be seen in the factor proportions and efficiency
of factor use in Korean manufacturing. The sector has generally been typified
by low capital/output and capital/labor ratios and high rates of growth of
productivity. The unlagged incremental capital/output ratio in the manufac-
turing sector was 1.7 (in 1975 prices) during 1968-78 but there has been a
small increase in the ratio during the last few years which is perhaps due
to the increased relative importance of steel, petrochemicals, shipbuilding
and machinery industries. This fairly low ICOR is at least in part due to
high rates of capacity utilization reflecting in turn good management and
organization. After falling between 1960 and 1966, the average cost of job
creation in manufacturing industry during the last decade has been relatively
stable although it is recently showing signs of increasing due to growing
shortages of labor. High and sharply increasing levels of labor productivity
have been and remain a fundamental strength of the Korean development process.
Real wages costs still appear quite competitive internationally although
recent increases could affect Korea's competitive edge. However, productivity
levels compare very favorably with other developing countries and are probably
not too far behind those of Japan in the traditional industries. The efficient
use of capital and the steady improvement in labor productivity have enabled
the Korean economy to maintain a GNP growth rate of nearly 10.2% p.a. during
the last decade while investing only about 28% of GNP on average.
1.03      Recent Performance.  The Korean economy recovered remarkably well
in 1976 and 1977 after the recessionary period of 1974-75. The performance
of the manufacturing sector was particularly impressive with a 27% real
growth of value added in 1976,/l 14% in 1977 and about 20% in 1978. Exports
increased by about 40% in volume in 1976 and 17% in 1977, reaching US$10.0
billion in that year, and growing further to US$12.7 billion in 1978. This
/1 Compared to 13% in 1975.



- 2 -
growth in exports was historically led by a strong demand for Korea's tradi-
tional export products such as textile yarns, fabrics and clothing which
maintained a share of about 35% of total commodity exports. Korea's efforts
at reducing the concentration of its exports towards the US and Japan have
met with considerable success in recent years; in 1977 the combined share of
the US and Japan dropped to 52%, and in 1978 was estimated at 50%, compared
with a level of 70% in 1973, essentially as a result of the development of
new markets in Europe and the Middle East. Commodity exports to the Middle
East, earlier negligible, amounted to more than US$1.04 billion in 1977, and
US$1.1 billion in 1978.

Light manufactures have declined from 67% of total manufacturing value added
in 1971 to 62% in 1976, while heavy manufactures have risen from about 31% to
35% over the same period. In coming years, the Government intends to encour-
age more skill-intensive subsectors such as machinery and electronics where
Korea enjoys a competitive advantage over other developing countries because
of its skilled labor resources.
Geographic Distribution
1.05      In 1975, (based on the October 1975 census) approximately 27% of the
population of Korea lived in the cities of Seoul and Pusan; the Province of North
Gyeongsang where Taegu, the third major industrial city, is located, accounted
for another 14% of the population. The following table shows that the regional
distribution of industry and industrial employment is also skewed in favor of
Seoul and Pusan.

There was little change in the geographic dispersal of industrial employment
in Korea between 1971 and 1975; Seoul and Pusan remain by far the largest
industrial centers. The Government, however, has become increasingly aware
of the need to achieve, through a wider geographic dispersal of industries, a
better distribution of employment opportunities and a reduction of the
congestion and overcrowding in Seoul and Pusan. In this connection, the
Government is implementing the Population Dispersion Plan for the Seoul
(Metropolitan) area during 1977-86. The Government has also been promoting
the development of large industrial centers outside these two areas principally
through the establishment of free trade zones and industrial estates.
Examples of this policy include the iron and steel plants in Pohang, the
petrochemical complex in Ulsan, the integrated chemical industry in Yeosu,
and the machinery center at Changwon (para. 2.06). The Saemaeul Movement,
initiated in 1971, also aims at creating industrial employment opportunities
in rural areas and at reducing the disparities of income between urban and
rural areas.

Financial Structure of Enterprises
1.06      The interest rate structure and slowdown in economic activity
during the period 1970 to mid-1972 had resulted in a deterioration of the
financial position and structure of Korean enterprises. Companies had become
highly dependent on the high cost, short-term "curb-market" for their finan-
cing. To improve their situation, a Presidential Decree of August 1972 froze
all loans from the unorganized money market and new measures were adopted
which lengthened maturities of certain loans, reduced interest rates to 16.8%
p.a. and converted loans from shareholders into equity. These measures as
well as the remarkable performance of the Korean economy in 1973 resulted in a
considerable improvement of the financial position and performance of Korean
enterprises. The aggregate debt/equity ratio of manufacturing enterprises
fell from 3.9:1 to 3.1:1 in 1972 and 2.7:1 in 1973. The average interest
rate on borrowings of manufacturing enterprises concurrently declined from
13.4% to 8.6%. Profitability improved markedly with net profits increasing
from an average of 1% of total assets in 1971 to 7.9% in 1973. However, with
the quadrupling of oil prices at end-1973 and sharp increases in the costs of
raw materials, enterprises were again subject to considerable financial
strains. In an effort to sustain economic activity and employment, the
Government helped finance the buildup of manufacturing inventories. Enter-
prises were subject to increasing costs of production and had to resort to
increased borrowings, hence the aggregate debt/equity ratio increased to 3.2
in 1974 and 3.6 in 1976. Profitability decreased with net income declining
as a percentage of total assets from 7.9% in 1973 to 5.7%, 3.9% and 4.6%
respectively in 1974, 1975 and 1976. There is, however, evidence that with
the upturn in economic activity from the end of 1975 the financial structure
and performance of Korean enterprises have improved.
Trends in Industrial Investment
1.07      Fixed capital formation in the manufacturing sector amounted to
W 1,544 billion in 1978, (equivalent to 21.9% of gross domestic capital forma-
tion in that year), which represented a 67% increase over the 1977 level of
W 922 billion, which in turn, was 29% over the 1976 level of W 716 billion
(all in current prices). In terms of constant 1975 prices, the real increase
in fixed capital formation was nearly 55% between 1977 and 1978. During the
remainder of Fourth Five-Year Plan period the growth rate of GNP is expected
to be 9.3% per annum with mining and manufacturing growing at 13.5% p.a.
Total gross fixed investment was projected at W 18,000 billion /1 for the
entire Plan period with manufacturing accounting for 28.3% by the end of the
Plan period.
Industrial Policies
1.08      Over the past ten years, industrial incentives in Korea have been
highly responsive to particular and changing circumstances, and varied with
Government policies and priorities for industrial development. These policies
/1 At 1975 prices.



aimed, with variable emphasis, at the promotion of export industries, geo-
graphic dispersal of industry, assistance to small and medium industries and,
more recently, investment in heavy industries.
1.09      A comprehensive incentive system was established during the first
half of the 1960s which generally favored the promotion of exports over import
substitution. The main elements of the incentive package included unrestricted
access to, and tariff exemptions on, imports of raw materials and capital goods,
generous waste allowances in determining duty-free raw material imports; direct
and indirect tax reductions; access to subsidized credit for working capital and
fixed investment; and rate subsidies on certain inputs. Key import substi-
tuting industries received protection from imports through tariffs and quanti-
tative import controls. Estimates of effective subsidy rates show, however,
that export activity was generally favored over import substitution. The
international competitiveness of Korean industry had substantially improved
between 1970 and 1973 partly due to successive devaluations of the won, and the
Government consequently decided to reduce export incentives. Preferential rates
of corporate income tax were abolished and interest rate subsidies were also
reduced. In 1975, tariff exemptions on imported inputs were abolished in favor
of a system by which the tariff on imported inputs is paid at the time of impor-
tation and rebated at the time of export. Tariff exemptions on imports of
machinery and equipment by export industries were abolished in 1974;/1 payment
of custom duties can, however, be stretched over a three-year period.
1.10      While key import substituting industries have been granted many of
the preferences given to exporters, production for domestic sale has generally
been subject to higher duties, taxes and interest charges compared with rates
charged to exporters but has nevertheless benefited from tariffs and restrictions
on imports. Over the last few years there has been a modest decline in tariff
rates,/2 and there was some reliance on import restrictions as a means of
affording protection to domestic producers particularly in the case of capital
goods. However in 1977-78 the Government relaxed some of these restrictions
as part of an import liberalization program./3 As a counterpart for the
protection which had been afforded to domestic producers through import
controls, the Government in 1976 established price controls for major commo-
dities./4 However, following the implementation of import liberalization in
1977/78, the Government is now planning to relax these price controls on a
number of items.
/1  Only in the case of capital goods imported under foreign capital
financing is there still complete and automatic exemption from tariffs.
/2  The ratio of effective customs burden to total import declined from 8.9%
in 1977 to about 7.1% in 1978.
/3  The number of prohibited items has declined from 77 in 1968 to 66 in
1975 and to 60 in 1977 while items subject to import restrictions
increased from 398 to 597 in 1976 but were reduced again to 456 in 1977.

Trade Law.

Prospects
1.11      Export orientation has been the dominant feature influencing the
structure and rate of expansion of the manufacturing sector. Export growth
has been accompanied by a policy of selective import-substitution which has
helped the aggregate dependence upon imported intermediate inputs and
capital goods remain at roughly the same level over the last decade. Although
import substitution has played a significant role in some sectors and over
specific time periods, its contribution to the growth of manufacturing output
as a whole has been very limited. It is estimated that over the period
1960-68 domestic demand contributed some 60% to the growth of manufacturing,
while export expansion and import substitution contributed respectively 38%
and 2%. The emphasis given to exports of light manufactures has resulted in
a rather high degree of dependence upon imports as a source of raw materials
and intermediate inputs, as is reflected in the fact that the domestic value
added content of Korea's exports was only about 50% in 1975. While it is
clear that Korea's poor natural resource endowment limits the scope for
backward linkages, there is a real need for Korea to undertake a deepening of
its industrial structure. Awareness of the desirability of deepening Korea's
industrial structure was present in the formulation of both the Second and
Third Five-Year Plans and lead to the decision to build the first integrated
steel mill and petrochemical complex. The long-term plan covering the decade
up to 1981 which was published by the Economic Planning Board (EPB) in 1973
emphasized the accelerated development of the heavy and chemical industries
as a critical element of Korea's future industrialization. The 1973-74
economic setbacks have rendered a reexamination of this long-term development
plan necessary and while, in the Fourth Five-Year Plan, emphasis remains on
developing heavy industry and on increasing the domestic content of exported
manufactures, some heavy capital and energy-intensive projects have been
deferred or cancelled altogether. A concomitant development has been the
greater emphasis on light industries to meet domestic demand, which is also
one of the measures aimed at relieving inflationary pressure.
1.12      Over the five-year period of the Plan (1977-81) the GNP was expected
to grow at a rate of 9.2% p.a. fueled by a 16.5% annual growth in the volume
of manufactured exports. The mining and manufacturing sector which in 1978
accounted for 28.2% of GNP (at current market prices) was expected to increase
at 14.3% p.a., a higher rate of growth than that of GNP, which would bring
the contribution of the mining and manufacturing sector to 41% of GNP by
1981. It was expected that some 55% of the two million new jobs to be
created during the Fourth Five-Year Plan period will be in the mining and
manufacturing sector. As in previous years, Korea's economic development
would essentially remain export-led, the ratio of commodity exports to GNP
which reached 27% in 1975 and nearly 32% in 1977, would rise to 42% by 1981.
In 1978 it had reached 35%. However, compared to their real growth rate of
32% p.a. over the period of 1967-75, exports were projected to increase at a
more modest 16.8% p.a. The Plan was based on the assumption that Korea's
exports of textiles, clothing and other light manufactures had a limited
growth potential and would be subject to encroachment by other developing



- 7 -
countries. Korea's comparative advantage will, therefore, increasingly lie
in industries which require more skilled labor and greater industrial sophis-
tication such as machinery, electronics and shipbuilding. The real growth of
exports of these products would be around 30% p.a. over the 1976-81 period.
The share of manufactures was expected to rise from about 85% of total
merchandise exports in 1975 to 92% by 1981. By 1978 it had reached 90%. In
order to sustain the projected GNP growth rate of 9.2% p.a., gross fixed
investment would need to rise at 7.8% p.a. In relation to GNP, the projected
investmenV is slightly lower than in the Third Plan period (26.2% of GNP as
against 26.9% during the 1972-76 period). In 1977/78, however, this ratio
actually increased to about 35% of GNP. The share of manufacturing investment
in total gross investment was projected to increase by only 2% from its
average share of 24.6% during the Third Five-Year Plan to 26.5% during the
Fourth Five-Year Plan. The shift in Korea's export strategy towards more
skill-intensive exports is reflected in both the planned structure of industrial
output and in projected investment allocations. The share of heavy and
chemical industries was expected to rise from 43% of total value added in
manufacturing in 1975, to nearly 52% by 1981. Investment in light industries
was expected to decrease from 40% of total investment outlays in the manufac-
turing sector over the Third Plan period to 36% over the next five years;
conversely, investment in the heavy and chemical industries would be reduced
in relative terms from approximately 75% of investment outlays in heavy and
chemical industries over the Third Plan period to 61% over the Fourth Five-Year
period in favor of investment in machinery and electronics which would increase
from 25% to 39%.
1.13      The Plan's estimate of total investment required for the expansion
and restructuring of Korea's industrial sector had been set at around
$ 10.5 billion over the 1977-81 period. There were grounds for believing,
however that Korea's investment needs for 1977-81 may have been underesti-
mated, while the domestic savings target (which calls for an increase in the
proportion of domestic savings to GNP from 16.3% in 1970 to 27.1% in 1981)
appeared somewhat ambitious. The conjunction of these two possibilities
would have lead to a continued reliance on substantial inflows of foreign
capital. Therefore the Korean Government has in recent years undertaken a
major effort to mobilize domestic resources. Toward that objective, the
Government established in 1973 the National Investment Fund (NIF), which is
expected to finance a sizeable portion of the investment needs of Korea's
major industries. The NIF was conceived as an important supplement to
various programs of domestic savings mobilization, and particularly as a
source of funds for long-term investment, primarily for plant and equipment.
The NIF derives its funds from a variety of sources including the national
savings associations; pension funds; postal savings; deposits in banking
institutions (15% of which must be invested in NIF bonds); savings funds; and
NIF's bond sales to the public. The Government has also embarked on a
comprehensive capital market development plan, including the restructuring of
the Korean Securities Financing Corporation and the development of new
financial institutions such as merchant banks and the Korea Export Import
Bank. Over the period 1977-81, the Plan expects domestic funds to provide
63% of the aggregate investment in manufacturing and foreign capital to
provide the remainder.
1.14      The Fourth Five Year Plan, as described above, has to a certain
extent been overtaken by recent events.l/ The actual economic performance

spectives," Report No. 2477-KO dated May 15, 1979.



- 8 -
during 1977/78 surpassed most of the FFYP targets.    For instance, the GNP
increased by 10.5% and 12.5% in 1977 and 1978 respectively, compared with FFYP
targets of 10% and 9% for those years. Consequently, in order to counter the
resultant inflationary pressures (wholesale prices increased by 11.7% in 1978)
and promote stabilization, the Government introduced the Economic Management Plan
(EMP) for 1979-81. The most important features of this Plan include a slower
growth of real GNP of 9.3% p.a. for 1979-81, a slower growth of export volume of
12% p.a. for that period and a substantially reduced growth rate of real investment
to only about 13% p.a. In addition this Plan envisages a greater emphasis on light
industries geared to meeting domestic demand, and some reduction in investment
growth in heavy and chemical industries (although their share of total exports is
still estimated to increase significantly). Furthermore the rate of import growth
is now expected to exceed the FFYP target.
1.15      The Bank has worked closely with the Government in the formulation
and implementation of industrial policies and is in basic agreement with the
main thrust and priorities of these policies.
2. THE SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY SECTOR
Definition
2.01      The Small Industry Basic Act and the Presidential Decree enforcing
the Small and Medium Industry Bank Act define Korean small and medium indus-
tries (SMI) in terms of total assets or employment size. These definitions
were amended in January 1977 and the criteria presently applicable to the
various subsectors are summarized below:
Total assets    Number of
(W million)      employees
Mining, manufacturing, transportation          Up to 500      Up to 300
Construction                                   Up to 500      Up to 50
Commerce and services                          Up to 50       Up to 20
Under Korean law, enterprises, depending on their size, are eligible for
financial assistance from specific government-owned development finance
institutions./l The functional demarcation is broadly as follows; at the
upper end of the size spectrum the Korea Development Bank (KDB) caters for
large firms, i.e., those which exceed both of the criteria listed above. The
Small and Medium Industry Bank (SMIB) provides financial assistance to small
and medium enterprises which meet at least one of the two criteria above./2
At the lower end of the spectrum, the legal definition of enterprise size
in Korea does not formally distinguish between small and medium, although in
practice the ceilings (set by law and/or government regulations) on the
/1 This does not apply to the operations of the privately-owned Korea
Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) which may in principle finance
enterprises of all sizes.
/2 The bulk of firms financed by SMIB qualify under both limits, though
under the second Bank loan 28 subborrowers (out of a total of 196)
exceeded the SMI total asset limit of W 500 million, which is allowed for
foreign exchange financing (up to W 1 billion, see para. 4.16). None,
however, exceeded the employment ceiling of 300.



lending operations of the Citizens National Bank (CNB)/1 define the respec-
tive clienteles of SMIB and CNB. These matters are elaborated in greater
detail in paras. 4.14-4.16.
Role of SMI in the Korean Economy
2.02      Various trends in recent SMI performance are summarized in Annex 5,
Table 1. In 1977, there were an estimated 25,600/2 SMI enterprises in Korea
representing about 96% of the total number of enterprises in the manufactur-
ing sector. In the same year, SMI enterprises accounted for about 46% of
employment and 33% of value added in the manufacturing sector. This implies
that labor productivity in SMI enterprises, as approximated by value added per
employee, was about half (57.7%) the level prevailing in large enterprises.
The level of value added per employee in SMI has increased rapidly in recent
years and consequently the labor productivity gap between large and small
enterprises has declined slightly. The SMI sector accounted for a reasonably
steady 30% of manufacturing output, but its share of manufacturing's fixed
asset investment has increased from about 20% in 1975 to 26% in 1976./3 This
shift to relatively greater capital intensity in SMI enterprises could have
been due to the emergence of occasional labor shortages in 1976.
2.03      It is apparent that SMIs make an important contribution to the
economy, especially in terms of employment. However, in the context of
export-led growth, it is particularly SMIs' export performance which has
been outstanding and represents perhaps one of its most significant contri-
butions to overall growth in Korea. Over the past four years, about 36%
of total commodity exports and 40% of total industrial exports originated in
the SMI sector (Annex 5, Table 2), reaching US$4.6 billion in 1978. This is
significantly larger than the SMI share of manufacturing output and value
added, which both stood at about 30% in 1975/76, and shows that Korean
SMIs have been highly responsive to the Government's incentives aimed at an
increased export orientation of SMIs.
Industrial Structure of SMIs
2.04      The proportional distribution of value added and employment per
industry is shown below. It is worth noting that four industries, textiles,
fabricated metals, food processing and chemicals accounted for 76% of value
added and 77% of employment for SMI enterprises in 1976. This distribution
is very similar to that of large enterprises where the same four industries

accounted for 84% and 83% of respectively value added and employment. Amongst
these four industries, labor productivity was highest in food processing and
lowest in textiles, regardless of enterprise size.

ments and employment, less concentrated in the two major cities of Seoul and
Busan than large enterprises, which indicates that SMIs contributed more to the
regional dispersal of employment opportunities.
2.06      The comparison between the regional distribution of SMI in 1972
and 1976, which shows an increasing concentration of SMI enterprises and
employment in the two major industrial cities, is misleading as the defini-
tion of SMI applicable to the 1976 data was expanded substantially to include
enterprises employing up to 300 workers./l Indeed, despite this enlarged
definition, the magnitude of SMI employment and enterprise increases in Seoul
and Busan between these two dates is very modest. Hence it could reasonably
be inferred that the period 1972-76 actually saw a change towards greater
regional dispersal of all SMIs (as was the case for large enterprises). This
was partly the result of the various measures undertaken by the Government to
/1 This new definition is applied to 1976 while the old definition of up to
200 workers applies to 1972.

encourage the location of SMIs outside the two main urban centers, which
include: (a) the Saemaeul (New Community) Movement, started in 1971, which
inter alia promotes the development of small factories in rural areas so
as to provide off-farm employment opportunities for rural households
(para. 4.31); (b) the development of Regional Industrial Estates located
near secondary cities and directed primarily towards the needs of SMI;/1 and
(c) Specialized Industrial Estates where industries specialized in a par-
ticular activity (e.g., machinery manufacturing) are located and where
the larger industries provide opportunities for subcontracting and the
provision of ancillary services by SMI./2

Financing of SMIs
2.07      Korean SMIs receive financial assistance from three sources:
(a) the commercial banking system, comprising five nationwide commercial
banks and ten local commercial banks; (b) the Small and Medium Industry Bank
(SMIB); and (c) the Citizens National Bank (CNB):
/1  There were 11 such estates at end-1978 in Daegu, Gumi, Jeonju, Iri,
Kwangju, Mokpo, Cheonju, Daejeon, Wonju, Chooncheon, and Banwol.
/2  At end-1978 there were six specialized industrial estates, for machinery,
non-ferrous metals and precious-metals industries. The Government plans
to establish a further 20 such estates over the period 1979-83.

Most of the financing extended to SMI (about 90% on an outstanding basis) is
in the form of short-term working capital loans. Commercial banks do not
normally lend long-term funds for equipment financing but do have a liberal
policy of rolling over short-term lines of credit as they mature. SMIB, and
to a much smaller extent, CNB, are the major sources of equipment financing
for SMI.
2.08      Commercial Banks.  As indicated in the above table, the commercial
banks are the major source of finance for SMI, although the bulk of their
lending is for short-term working capital purposes. Commercial banks,
including local banks, are statutorily required by the Government to direct
at least 30% of their lending to SMI. Compliance with this requirement is
supervised by BOK. Loans are granted on the basis of collateral and the
borrower's credit standing.
2.09      Citizens National Bank (CNB).  The Government-owned CNB was estab-
lished in 1963 to extend consumers credit and provide banking services to
households and very small enterprises of the cottage industry type. CNB is
authorized to provide domestic currency term financing /1 (up to five years)
for eligible borrowers, namely industrial enterprises employing up to 100
workers./2 The maximum loan size to small enterprises is W 30 million
(US$62,000)/2, and for households W 10 million (US$20,600)./3 CNB's lending
rate is 19% p.a. at present, which is in line with oLher institutions. Loans
to small enterprises accounted for about 52% of CNB's outstanding portfolio,
/1  CNB has recently been authorized by Government to also undertake foreign
currency term financing.
/2  Until February 1977, these limits stood at 49 employees, and W 5 million
(US$10,300).
/3  In addition, CNB may extend working capital loans to a maximum limit of
W 40 million (US$82,500) and guarantees to a limit of W 30 million. The
Government is presently considering CNB's request to increase the limit on
term loans from W 30 million to W 100 million (US$206,000).

which stood at W 460 billion as of end-1978, the remainder being loans to
households. CNB derives its financial resources mainly from demand and time
deposits, and additionally from borrowings from the Government and BOK.
At end-1978, its total assets amounted to W 870 billion (US$1.8 billion)
and its staff numbered 5,980 employed in 154 branches and 7 deposit offices
throughout the country. To date, CNB lends on the basis of collateral and
does not undertake project appraisal.
2.10      Fixed Investment in SMI.  Total fixed asset formation by manufac-
turing industries reached W 1.2 billion in 1976, of which SMI enterprises
employing up to 300 workers accounted for 25.5% or W 296 million (US$610 mil-
lion). Studies by SMIB have shown that up to 60% of SMI fixed investment
is financed from the enterprises' internal funds and the balance from bor-
rowings. Loans from institutional sources (e.g. commercial banks, CNB, SMIB,
see paras. 2.07 - 2.09) accounted for only about 60% of SMI borrowings, which
suggests that SMI enterprises had to rely partly on non-institutional sources
of finance, including private borrowings and the curb market.
Nonfinancial Assistance to SMIs
2.11      Government Policy for SMIs.  The Government launched its program for
promoting small and medium industries in the early 1960s with the establish-
ment of SMIB in 1961 and a Small Industry Division in the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry. The Government initially confined its promotion efforts to
the provision of financial assistance through SMIB and ensuring that adequate
technical assistance was available through SMIB's extension services. Subse-
quently, as the importance of the SMI contribution to generating employment
outside the urban areas and to the growth of exports and to the deepening of
the industrial structure through subcontracting arrangements became more appa-
rent,the Government broadened its efforts and introduced additional specific
measures for SMI. These included: (a) the 1971 Saemaeul Program (para. 2.06)
under which loans are provided at preferential interest rates, along with
easy access to industrial utilities and land, and under which concessionary
tax rates are applied for SMI enterprises establishing in rural areas;
(b) incentives given to export-oriented SMIs to relocate in industrial
estates and export zones and to coordinate marketing of SMI production
overseas; and (c) special depreciation allowances encouraging modernization
of machinery and productivity improvements. In addition to these measures
the availability of financial assistance to SMIs at the smaller end of the
spectrum (whose access to financing is frequently limited due to lack of
collateral) has recently been improved with the establishment of the Korea
Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF)/l and the recent growth of leasing services./2
/1 This fund was administered by SMIB until 1976 when it was spun off as an
autonomous institution.
/2 Lease financing is unrelated to the lessee's capital base and
collateral as the ownership of the financed equipment remains
with the lessor. Hence it is particularly well suited to the
needs of small and medium enterprises. The business of the three
Korean leasing companies (Korea Development Leasing Corporation,
Korea Industrial Leasing Company and Whashin Tiger International
Leasing Co.) has grown rapidly in recent years.



- 14 -
2.12      Small Industry Bureau (SIB).  Originally a Division of the Ministry
of Commerce and Industry, the SIB is responsible for the formulation and
implementation of Government policies for SMI. The SIB monitors progress in
the SMI sector and gathers information on SMI. Due to its limited staff, the
SIB relies heavily on SMIB, the National Federation of Small and Medium
Industry Cooperatives and the provincial governments to carry out its func-
tions. The SIB will also be coordinating closely with the recently established
Small and Medium Industries Promotion Corporation (SMIPC).
2.13      Korea Federation of Small Business (KFSB)/l   Established in 1962
under the Small and Medium Industry Cooperatives Act, the KFSB is the apex
institution of SMI cooperatives throughout the country. These cooperatives
perform a number of functions for their members including provision of
managerial and technical guidance, dissemination of economic and business
information, joint purchase of raw materials, marketing assistance, etc. The
cooperatives' operations are partially funded by the Government either
through direct grants or indirectly through tax exemptions and subsidized
loans.
The Small and Medium Enterprise Promotion Law
2.14      In 1976 the Government first increased its contribution to SMIB's
paid-in equity capital, which symbolized the higher priority which it
attached to the promotion of SMI. Since that date the Government has under-
taken a comprehensive reexamination of the provision of financial and non-
financial assistance to the SMI sector, which led to the enactment in
December 1978 of the Small and Medium Enterprise Promotion Law. Although
implementation decrees remain to be finalized, the broad outlines of the Act
are summarized below.
2.15      The Act provides for a revised institutional structure dealing with
promotion of and assistance to SMIs (Chart 2).  The Small and Medium Industry
Promotion Corporation (SMIPC), established in January 1979, will operate under
the broad guidance of MCI and become the central agency for coordinating and
executing the various promotional and assistance activities. The SMIPC will
be an autonomous legal entity empowered to incur debt (including foreign
borrowings). As regards the financial aspects of SMI assistance and pro-
motion, the SMIPC will establish and administer a Small and Medium Industry
Promotion Fund which will derive its resources from the Government (budgetary),
from borrowings and from retained earnings. The SMIPC will allocate resources
from this Fund to various Government financial institutions for onlending to
SMI in accordance with specific developmental guidelines./2 The SMIPC will
also make direct investments in equity of SMI enterprises, where appropriate.
On the non-financial side, the Act's most important feature relates to the
/1 Previously named the National Federation of Medium Industry Cooperatives
(NFMIC).
/2   These will be developed by the SMIPC, and will stress modernization,
balancing and "harmonization"; the development or importation of
appropriate technology; the provision on a cooperative basis of ware-
housing, transportation, welfare and pollution prevention services to
SMIs, etc.



- 15 -
provision of managerial and technical guidance (i.e. extension services) and
training for SMI entrepreneurs. The SMIPC will coordinate the provision of
extension services through multiple specialized agencies including SMIB, as
well as providing such managerial and technical extension services itself. In
addition, the SMIPC will establish a Training Institute for SMI entrepreneurs
and extension officers. It is expected that SMIB's role in the promotion of
and assistance to SMI enterprises in Korea will be enhanced as a result of
this law, notably through its role as agent for the Government (i.e. SMIPC)
in allocating the Promotion Fund resources.
3. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Institutional Setup
3.01      The financial sector of Korea consists of the Bank of Korea,
Deposit Money Banks and nonbanking financial institutions. The Bank of
Korea performs regular central banking functions, including the supervision
of commercial banks.
3.02      Deposit Money Banks include commercial banks and specialized banks.
Commercial banks receive most of their funds through deposits from the
public. They can make all kinds of loans but have traditionally concentrated
on short-term lending although term financing through roll-over of short-term
loans is common. There are 5 nationwide commercial banks, 10 banks with
localized operations and 21 branches of foreign banks which together had 743
branches/offices around the country at end-1978 (all these fall into the
category of "commercial banks"). Four of the five nationwide commercial
banks are fully controlled by the Government which, under Korean law,
automatically receives majority rights if its holding in a nationwide bank is
10% or more. The fifth bank is controlled by the semi-official Korean
Traders Association. All commercial banks are subject to control and super-
vision by the Bank of Korea while specialized banks are directly controlled
by the Ministry of Finance.  The specialized banks were all established under
a Special Banking Act and are subject to only a few specific Articles of the
Bank of Korea Act and General Banking Act. Specialized banks are government-
controlled and/or owned. As their name implies, they were founded for
particular purposes or sectors (such as small-scale industry financing or
agricultural financing) and government funds constitute a substantial part of
their financial resources in addition to resources raised otherwise, the bulk
of which consists of deposits raised from the public, hence their categor-
ization as Deposit Money Banks. Specialized banks include the Korea Exchange
Bank, which was established in 1967 mainly to relieve the Bank of Korea of
commercial foreign exchange business, the Small and Medium Industry Bank
which extends financial and technical assistance to small and medium-scale
industries, and which has so far received two Bank loans totalling US$85
million, the Citizens National Bank (mainly for mobilizing small savings and
financing household loans and small enterprises), the Korea Housing Bank, the
National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) and the National Fisheries
Cooperative.



- 16 -
3.03      Besides the above-mentioned banking institutions which, with the
BOK as supervising agency, constitute the "Monetary System," there are
several nonbanking financial institutions, namely: (a) development finance
institutions; (b) savings institutions; (c) life insurance companies; (d)
investment companies; and (e) Merchant Banks. The development finance
institutions comprise the Korea Development Bank (KDB) which so far has
received three Bank loans totalling US$252.5 million, the Korea Development
Finance Corporation (KDFC) to which Bank Group assistance, including IFC,
amounts to US$340 million to date, the Land Bank and the Export-Import Bank.
Savings institutions comprise some 1,200 authorized credit unions and 211
mutual savings and finance companies. Five life insurance companies operate
in Korea, in addition to the Postal Life Insurance and the Educational
Insurance Company. Investment companies include the Korea Securities Finance
Corporation which is the principal organization for securities financing in
Korea, ten short-term finance companies /1 and the Korea Investment Trust
Corporation which is specialized in the establishment of investment trust
funds. In addition, three leasing companies have been established over the
last few years as joint ventures between Korean and foreign investors. The
Merchant Banks are the latest arrivals on the Korean financial scene. Five
such banks have so far been established; the Korean Merchant Banking Corpo-
ration (KMBC); the Korea-Kuwait Banking Corporation; the Saehan Merchant
Banking Corporation; the Korea-French Banking Corporation and the Asian
Banking Corporation.
3.04      As of December 31, 1978, total loans outstanding to the manufactur-
ing sector by the deposit money banks and KDB amounted to W 4,247.6 billion or
US$8.75 billion equivalent. About 73% of this was for operating funds, mainly
supplied by commercial banks. The largest supplier of equipment loans (i.e.
term loans) is KDB which, as of December 31, 1978 had an outstanding portfolio
in the manufacturing sector of W 552.3 billion (US$1.14 billion), which
accounted for the bulk of the outstanding medium and long-term credit by
banking institutions to the manufacturing sector as of that date.
Capital Market
3.05      The Korean Stock Market was moribund for many years but showed signs
of life in 1972. Before then the yields on stocks were considered unattrac-
tive as both savings accounts of commercial banks and the "curb market" gave
higher returns. The market was also thin because closely held companies were
reluctant to go public. With the mid-1972 economic boom and the adoption of
new financial measures by the Government (para. 1.06), the public showed
growing interest in the stock market. The curb market was severely checked
as a result of the August 1972 measures and with decreasing interest rates
offered by commercial banks, yields on stocks became attractive. In addition,
the overall investment climate became more favorable after August 1972, and
the campaign for more stock listings and for companies to go public was
intensified. The result was a large increase in stock exchange activity in
/1 Including the Korea Investment Finance Corporation (KIFC), an affiliate of
KDFC.

the second half of 1972 and in 1973. In 1974, however, the growth of
trading activities on the exchange slowed down considerably due to the gloomy
business outlook; new stock listings, however, continued to rise reaching
almost W 500 million at the end of 1974. The following table summarizes the
stock exchange activity over the last few years (figures are shown as of the
end of each period):

With the general improvement of the business climate and improved export
prospects, trading picked up again around mid-1975 and for the year as a
whole the number of stocks listed almost doubled.
3.06      During 1977, the capital market exhibited a highly active perfor-
mance in response to the Government's vigorous efforts to promote the going
public of privately held companies. The supply of capital through the stock
market to business firms during the year totalled W 363 billion, which
exceeded the year's target of W 320 billion. Of this, W 44 billion was
through public offering of equity shares, W 142 billion through share capital
increases of listed companies, and the remaining W 177 debentures. The
volume of transactions in the secondary stock market expanded by 119% during
1977, recording the trade volume of W 1,375 billion (1,271 million shares)
and the number of listed companies on the Korea Stock Exchange increased by
49 to 323. The stock price index rose by 21.3% to 504.1 at end 1977, largely
led by the substantial gain in prices of stocks of those companies engaged in
construction services, automobile manufacturing and cement industries.
3.07      In 1978 the number of listed companies showed a further increase of
33 to reach a total of 356. The market value of the listed stock also con-
tinued to grow, registering a 23% increase over 1977 and amounting to a level
of W 2,892.5 billion (or US$5.96 billion). To complete the overall favorable
growth experienced in 1978, the stock price index /1 performed well and
reached an average level of 202.8 as compared with an average of 154.5 in
1977.
/1 Revised to a 1975=100 basis.



- 18 -
3.08      The rapid increase in the volume of operations on the Stock Exchange
had rendered certain improvements necessary. Among others the call market
has been replaced by a continuous auction market, investment trust companies
have been established, and the information system greatly improved. Several
weaknesses remain, however. One of the more important problems lies in
existing laws which stipulate that new equity issues have to be at par
irrespective of the market price of the market price of stocks. These
regulations are currently under review by the Government. In addition,
gradual internationalization of the domestic stock market is being initiated
by the Government.
Interest Rates and Monetary Policy
3.09      The Government through the Monetary Board determines interest
rate ceilings on deposits and loans which apply to all banking institutions.
Although private specialized financial institutions such as KDFC or the
short-term finance companies are not legally bound, in practice, they too
have to follow government policies. The development of Korea's interest rate
structure has, between 1968 and 1973, seen a continuous reduction in both
deposit, and lending rates. The lowering of the rates coincided with the
Government's success in gradually bringing inflation down until late 1973.
With the emergence of the oil crisis and worldwide inflation, Korea's price
structure was particularly hard hit because of its high foreign trade dependence.
Wholesale prices are estimated to have increased by nearly 80% between the
end of 1973 and the end of 1975. While the Government selectively increased
interest rates at the end of 1974,/l a general increase of interest rates was
postponed because enterprises were already facing severe financial strains
and the Government hoped to succeed in bringing inflation under control.
During the year 1976, wholesale prices are estimated to have increased only
by 12.1% on an annual basis.
3.10      On August 2, 1976, the Government made an extensive upward adjust-
ment in and revision of the interest rate structure in order to contain
excessive loan demand and to better allocate funds. Prior to this date,
Korean commercial banks had already resorted to various practices which
resulted in increased collateral requirements and higher effective lending
rates for their less creditworthy borrowers. Such practices included the
collection of interest in advance, the establishment of compensating balances
on time deposits or even the opening of installment savings accounts which
are used both as collateral and sinking funds. The August 1976 measures
/1 Raising rates on time deposits for over three months and over six months
from respectively 12% to 15%, and preferential rates for loans from the
NIF and IRF from 9% and 8% respectively to 12%.



- 19 -
acted to ratify and further rationalize this system of differentiating
between borrowers on the basis of the risks involved. It led to a system
whereby (a) the interest rates on working capital loans vary according to the
credit standing of the borrower and (b) interest rates on equipment loans
vary according to the loan maturity. The Korean financial authorities
established a list of criteria for enterprises to qualify as a prime borrower
which has helped reduce the need for subjective judgments on the credit-
worthiness of borrowers. This introduction of a prime rate system for
working capital loans and of differential rates according to loan maturities
for equipment loans constitutes an important step towards improving the
overall allocation of funds to industry.
3.11      Effective July 1, 1977, the Government replaced the previous excise
business and consumption taxes by the value added tax (VAT) system, all goods
and services being assessed at a flat rate of 10%. There was some apprehen-
sion amongst the general public that the new taxation system might result in
an increased tax burden on industrial enterprises and consequently in sharp
rises in the cost of living. While the Government did not subscribe to this
thinking it decided to introduce various anti-inflation measures to moderate
the possible adverse impact of the new tax system. These measures included:
(a) a lowering of bank lending rates by 1% on July 1 and a further 1% on
October 1; time deposit rates were also lowered by 1.8% as from October 1,
1977; (b) the Government realigned and announced the prices of 851 major
commodity items, pegged the maximum permissible price levels of major daily
necessities and froze public utility rates until further notice; (c) easing
of import restrictions as discussed in para. 1.10; and (d) measures to
restrict growth of money supply including issuance of treasury bills and
repayment of some Government borrowings from the Bank of Korea. During 1978,
the Government continued with its active interest rate policy and in June
raised the general level of the structure of interest rates, chiefly as a
countercyclical measure, deposit rates being raised to 18.5% and onlending
rates to 19% or higher.
3.12      The rate of increase of wholesale prices in 1977 was 10.1% and the
growth of domestic money supply 40.7%. The targets set for 1977 as a whole
were a 10% limit to wholesale price increases and about a 25% limit to domes-
tic money supply growth. The money supply in the foreign sector more than
doubled in 1977 and in the last quarter of 1977 the Government introduced
various measures to curb its growth. Foreign banks were instructed in early
December to freeze their won loans at their October 1977 level; reserve
requirements for foreign currency deposits have also been established and
enforced. Further measures have also been taken to curb money supply growth
in the domestic sector; however, price controls were partially eased in two
stages on August 1, 1977 and December 1, 1977. In 1978, wholesale prices
increased by 12% and the growth of domestic money supply was reduced to
24.9%.

4. THE SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY BANK /1
A. Institutional Aspects
Legal Framework, Organization and Staff
4.01      Legal Framework and Ownership.  The Small and Medium Industry Bank
(SMIB) was established under the Small and Medium Industry Bank Act of July 1,
1961 for the purpose of extending financial and technical assistance to
small and medium-sized enterprises, as defined in the Presidential Decree of
August 1, 1961 which enforced the SMIB Act. Prior to the creation of this
new, specialized institution, the financial requirements of small and medium
industries were met by the commercial banks and the Korea Agricultural Bank.
SMIB's operations, broad policy framework, scope of activities, administra-
tion and capitalization are governed by the SMIB Act. As a specialized
financial institution, SMIB is subject to the broad supervision of the
Ministry of Finance (MOF), whose approval is required for the adoption and/or
revision of SMIB's by-laws, operating manuals, annual plan of operations,
appropriation of earnings and the appointment of SMIB's top management. As a
banking institution, SMIB is further subject to the supervision of the Bank
of Korea (BOK) particularly concerning its commercial banking activities such
as mobilization of deposits, discounting of bills, letters of credit, etc.,
all of which are regulated by the General Banking Act.
4.02      SMIB's Act was last amended in December 1975.  On that occasion,
SMIB's authorized share capital was increased from W 6 billion to W 30 billion.
At end-1978 the paid-in capital stood at W 20.06 billion. This represents
a substantial increase over recent years (compared with, say, W 3.06 billion
at end-1975), and stemmed largely from an agreement reached with the Government
during negotiations for the first Bank loan (September 1975), when the Govern-
ment undertook to increase SMIB's paid-in share capital as required to maintain
its long-term debt:equity ratio within the agreed limit of 10:1. The SMIB Act
also stipulates that the Government must own a minimum of 50% of SMIB's share
capital. As of end-1978, the Government owned 99.9% of paid-in share capital,
with private shareholders accounting for the remaining 0.1%. These residual
private holdings amounting to W 16 million resulted from the disposition of
excess dividends following the liquidation of the Federation of Financial
Associations of Korea at the time of SMIB's establishment.
4.03      Organization and Autonomy.  The SMIB Act provides for a dual Board
structure. The Board of Policy deals with overall policy matters, and com-
prises seven members including SMIB's President (who acts as Chairman), one
representative each from Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce and Indus-
try, Bank of Korea, National Federation of Small and Medium Industry Coopera-
tives, and two members representing small entrepreneurs who are selected by
/1 The Medium Industry Bank (MIB) was officially renamed in English, "The
Small and Medium Industry Bank" (SMIB) effective January 1, 1979. This
new name reflects a correction of a previous mistranslation. Its offi-
cial Korean name has always been "The Small and Medium Industry Bank."



- 21 -
MOF (Annex 1). The Board of Policy meets about three times a year primarily
to approve the settlement of SMIB's annual accounts and the appropriation of
earnings, any amendments to the by-laws and operating manuals, and SMIB's
annual plan of operations. Resolutions of the Board of Policy regarding the
above matters are subject to the approval of the Minister of Finance.
4.04      The Board of Directors has overall executive authority, which
includes the approval of loans and guarantees exceeding certain ceilings. It
also has seven members, including SMIB's President (acting as Chairman),
Deputy President and five directors (Annex 2). The dual Board structure
and demarcation of functions, as outlined above, has proved to be appropriate
and effective. On the one hand, it enables key government officials and
representatives of the SMI business community to participate in broad policy
deliberations within the Board of Policy, thereby facilitating the flow of
information between SMIB, the Government and the private sector. On the
other hand, it concentrates executive authority in the Board of Directors
which is a full-time professional body consisting of SMIB's senior management
team. This dual Board set-up therefore enables SMIB to operate within the
framework of Government policy while at the same time maintaining full
autonomy in its operational decisions.
4.05      Management.  Mr. Sang Jin Nam, a former Vice-Minister of MOF, was
appointed SMIB's President in May 1976. He is assisted by a Deputy President,
Mr. Sung Sang Park (formerly an Assistant Governor of the Bank of Korea), and
five Directors. This management team has, collectively, substantial exper-
ience in banking and financial matters. Each Director is in charge of at
least three of SMIB's 17 Departments (Organization Chart). SMIB's Presidents
have historically been appointed from senior levels of the Government hier-
archy. SMIB has an experienced and competent cadre of managers in its
departments and branch offices. It also has considerable depth at the deputy
manager level.
4.06      Staff.  SMIB's total staff numbered 4,032 at end-1978, of which 936
(or 23%) were stationed at Head Office and 3,096 (or 77%) at the branches.
Of this staff, about 24% were professionals (defined by functional category,
such as economists, engineers, financial analyst, etc.). SMIB's staff
requirements are projected to increase to 4,930 by 1982. (Annex 5, Table 3).
SMIB recruits mainly college graduates and places considerable emphasis on
systematic training, involving academic and professional training overseas,
courses at the Korea Banking Institute, various in-house courses, and a
general policy of rotational assignments within SMIB which are geared to
developing greater staff versatility. This comprehensive and methodical
approach to staff development has enabled SMIB to build up a solid cadre of
experienced and well-rounded professionals, notably at the lower and middle
management levels. The overall quality of SMIB's staff is good.
4.07      The staffing of the various departments at Head Office is adequate
(Organization Chart), and is sufficient to cope with the growing volume of
SMIB's business. Staff turnover for SMIB as a whole has declined from 11.5% in
1976 to 9.4% in 1977 and to 7.8% for 1978. However, amongst the more experienced
professional staff members, particularly those with a working knowledge of



- 22 -
English, the turnover has remained fairly high, which is mainly attributable
to the differences in compensation packages and promotion prospects between
the government banking sector and the rapidly growing private industrial
sector. This has in particular affected the Foreign Loan (FLD), Extension
Services (ESD), and Research and Statistics (RSD) Departments. On the whole,
however, staff turnover has had no discernible impact on SMIB's operational
efficiency, and new recruitment and internal transfers have maintained a
satisfactory number and distribution of staff. The management of SMIB is
keeping the situation under close review.
4.08      Branches.  With the rapid increase in income levels in Korea, SMIB
is making increasing efforts to tap the household and "storeholder" sectors
for the mobilization of demand and savings deposits, which represent a major
source of funds for its operations. Consequently, it has embarked on a
program of expanding its branch network from 65 branches in mid-1977 to
104 by end-1978, increasing to a planned 112 by end-1979. In addition, SMIB
maintains 6 deposit offices. This branch network expansion policy is sound
as regards the mobilization of domestic resources and geographical dispersal
of SMIB's operations, but it has resulted in a relatively high level of
administrative expenses (3.3% of average total assets in 1978), although this
is still not excessive relative to the levels of commercial banks, to which
SMIB, by virtue of its organization, is more comparable than to conventional
DFCs.
Operating Policies and Development Strategy
4.09      In 1969, SMIB's Board of Policy adopted a Policy Statement which
supplements the policy and operational guidelines of the SMIB Act (Annex 3).
It states that SMIB will assist small- and medium-scale private enterprises
with broad priority being given to export-oriented, relatively labor-intensive,
import substituting and subcontracting activities. It further outlines
SMIB's general operating procedures and financial exposure limits, notably
the provision that SMIB's total commitments in any single enterprise will not
normally exceed 25% of SMIB's total paid-in capital, legal reserves and
surplus; or 60% of the total assets of the enterprise. The financial guide-
lines do not specify a statutory limit on SMIB's long-term debt/equity ratio,
but a limit of 10:1 has been agreed by SMIB with IBRD and ADB. The long-term
debt/equity ratio was 8.5:1 at end-1978.
4.10      Since 1975, SMIB has, in consultation with the Bank, formulated
successive Development Strategies outlining its specific developmental
objectives for two-year periods of operations. Satisfactory progress has
been made in implementing past objectives. SMIB intends to consolidate these
achievements during 1980/81 by placing renewed emphasis on: the mobilization
of medium- and long-term domestic currency resources; the geographical
dispersal of its portfolio; and the provision of financial assistance (in
accordance with Government objectives) to small-scale and relatively labor-
intensive enterprises, small- and medium-sized machinery enterprises selected
by the Government under the FFYP (thereby promoting subcontracting arrange-
ments), and small rural industries within the Saemaeul Program (Annex 4).



- 23 -
Project Appraisal
4.11      For short-term working capital loans, SMIB's lending decisions
are essentially based on an assessment of the borrowers' credit standing and
available collateral, rather than on project analysis, a practice in line
with commercial banking. For term loans, SMIB's project analysis and
appraisal is sound. Throughout the project cycle the branch and head office
staff coordinate their work closely, especially on technical feasibility
(which benefits from SMIB's links with KIST /1) and creditworthiness aspects.
In parallel with this appraisal interaction, SMIB delegates loan approval
authority for amounts below certain ceilings ($100,000 for foreign currency
loans) to its branch managers. The analysis of technical, marketing, finan-
cial, managerial and economic aspects (mostly partial economic indicators,
ERRs are calculated only for projects above the free limit) of projects, is
generally comprehensive and thorough and continues to show improvement.
Under the second Bank Loan SMIB, after consultation with the Bank, has
endeavored to speed up processing of subprojects below the free limit by
simplifying its appraisal methodology and submitting a project summary
(rather than a full appraisal report) to the Bank. Experience with this
scheme has been satisfactory. Given the relatively large number of sub-
projects expected under the proposed Bank loan (about 260) and the consequent
need to speed-up the subproject appraisal process, it is appropriate that SMIB
should continue with this scheme.
Project Supervision
4.12      Project follow-up is delegated entirely to the branch offices,
except for foreign currency loans which are supervised jointly by the FLD at
head office together with the branches.  SMIB's loan agreements with its
subborrowers specify rights of project inspection and reporting requirements
which include submission of financial statements, information on production,
sales and changes in management or production facilities. More specifically,
following discussions with the Bank at the time of negotiations for the first
Bank loan, SMIB introduced a Project Monitoring System designed to evaluate
progress in project implementation and to measure ex-post the actual costs,
production and sales levels for comparison with FLD's ex-ante appraisal esti-
mates. SMIB appreciates the benefits of this scheme and will continue to
expand it./2 The financial and statistical monitoring is supplemented by
field visits to projects, normally at least twice a year and more frequently
for problem projects. The branches generally have frequent contacts with
clients, who, apart from term loans, often also receive working capital
loans and maintain deposit accounts with SMIB. The officers in the branches
are therefore well placed to diagnose implementation and liquidity problems
/1 The Korea Institute of Science and Technology.
/2 An analysis of 76 subprojects completed in the first half of 1977 indi-
cates that appraisal estimates are increasingly accurate. For instance,
only 11% of the projects had cost overruns of more than 10%.



- 24 -
at an early stage, and SMIB has accordingly trained its branch deputy mana-
gers in the provision of basic managerial and technical consultancy services.
More complex problems are referred to ESD at head office. The Branches
refer matters of loan rescheduling, foreclosure or write-offs to the Loan
Settlement Department at head office, and final decisions are subject to the
approval of the Loan Settlement Committee./l SMIB's follow-up work is very
effective, as reflected in the quality of its portfolio and low level of
arrears (para. 4.43).
Procurement and Disbursement
4.13      SMIB's procurement and disbursement procedures, as defined in its
Operating Manuals, are satisfactory, and their enforcement has ensured an
efficient and appropriate use of funds. For foreign currency loans the ESD
helps the borrower in drafting invitations for bids and supervises the
opening of bids. Procurement is normally based on about three competitive
quotations from foreign suppliers (international competitive bidding is
rare for procurement under SMIB's relatively small loan amounts). The final
offer and contract is jointly evaluated by the borrower and SMIB and is
subject to the latter's approval. For domestic currency term loans, dis-
bursements are made in accordance with the progress in project implementation
which is monitored by the loan officer.
B. OPERATIONS AND DEVELOPMENTAL IMPACT
Scope of Operations
4.14      There are four major institutions which provide development financing
assistance to the Korean industrial sector. Their functional demarcation is
broadly as follows: at one extreme of the institutional spectrum, the
government-owned Korea Development Bank (KDB) concentrates on financing
relatively large enterprises, assists government-sponsored and nonmanufactur-
ing projects as well as private manufacturing enterprises, and provides both
working capital and long-term finance in domestic and foreign currencies. Its
total assets amounted to W 1,969.0 billion (US$4.06 billion) at end-1978. The
privately-owned Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) also concentrates
on financing relatively large firms,/2 assists mainly manufacturing enterprises
all of which are privately-owned, and provides almost exclusively long-term
finance in foreign currency. Its total assets amounted to W 164.4 billion
(US$339 million) at end-1978. SMIB, which is government-owned, finances only
small and medium-sized firms (para. 4.15), most of which are relatively modern
privately-owned enterprises in the manufacturing sector, and it provides both

managers of the LSD and Accounting office.
/2  KDFC, however, with a view to enhance its socioeconomic impact, has
embarked on some limited but useful sc emes tor assisting small and
medium enterprises.



- 25 -
wcrking capital and long-term financing in domestic and foreign currencies.
Its total assets amounted to W 733.3 billion (US$1.51 billion) at end-1978.
At the smallest end of the scale, the government-owned Citizens National
Bank (CNB) finances the very small "household" enterprises in the informal
cottage inlustry/storeholder subsector, and provides domestic currency loans
only (CNB has, very recently, been authorized by the Government to undertake
lcng-term foreign exchange financing). Its total assets amounted to W 870
billion (US$1.8 billion) at end-1978. The demand for industrial financing in
Korea has hitherto been so large that, in so far as their lending activities
overlap, the operations of these four institutions have been complementary
rather than competitive.
4.15      The SIMIB Act confines SMIB's financing to "small and medium enter-
prises" as officially defined by the Presidential Decree enforcing the Act.
Since its inception in 1961 to 1976, small- and medium-scale manufacturing
enterprises were defined as those with either total assets not exceeding
W 50 million or with less than 200 employees. In the context of rapid
economic growth and changes in the industrial structure, a Presidential
Decree of January 18, 1977, increased these upper limits to W 500 million and
300 employees respectively. These two limits constitute the official demar-
cation between SMIB and KDB; if an enterprise qualifies under either or both
of these limits, it is eligible for borrowing from SMIB, but not KDB, and
conversely, if it exceeds both size limits, it is eligible for borrowing from
KLB only, and not SMIB. Although there is no official distinction between
small and medium enterprises in Korea, the lower limits of enterprises
eligible to borrow from SMIB are in practice defined by the official restric-
tions on CNB's financing.  CNB is not allowed to lend to enterprises with
more than 100 employees nor is it allowed to make domestic currency equipment
loans in excess of W 30 million./i If an enterprise exceeds either or both
criteria, it must borrow from SMIB, while conversely, if it is within both
limits it is eligible for borrowing from both SMIB and CNB. Apart from these
official criteria, there is a further, less formal, operating distinction
between CNB and SMIB; namely that the former concentrates on the informal/
cottage subsector of small industry while the latter operates mostly in the
organized, relatively modern subsector. The official ceilings which will
apply to CNB's future foreign exchange operations have not yet been defined.
In summary, SMIB's operations are subject to specific upper limits, but at the
lower end of its operating scale there are no official lower limits, instead
there is an area of overlap with CNB. Despite this degree of overlap, SMIB is
the predominant institutional source of long-term domestic and foreign
currency financing for SMI in Korea (para. 2.07).
4.16      As the eligibility criteria for SMI subborrowers are alternative
(either total asset size or employment size) SMIB could in theory finance
firms which apart from their employment size do not have any other charac-
teristics of SMI enterprises (e.g., relatively large capital-intensive firms).
Consequently, the Bank as well as ADB, in dealing with SMIB, have come
to regard the asset size of enterprises as the more meaningful criterion.
The Bank has imposed an asset limit on the use of its funds, which, given
/1 Further details on CNB's operations in para 2.09.



- 26 -
that foreign exchange financing is in greatest demand from firms at the
larger end of the SMI spectrum, should be higher than the total asset limit
applied to domestic currency borrowers (W 500 million). Consequently, in
agreement with the Government and SNIB, this asset limit has been fixed at
W 1 billion (US$2.06 million).
SMIB's Operations in Perspective
4.17      SMIB's operations have grown rapidly and as of end-1978 its
outstanding loan portfolio of W 456.9 billion (US$942.0 million) represented
about 5.3%of the total outstanding loans, both short- and long-term, extended
by all banking institutions in Korea./l In the particular field of term
finance, SMIB accounted for about 9.4% of all medium- and long-term equipment
loans outstanding to enterprises of all sizes in the manufacturing, construc-
tion and transportation sectors as of December 31, 1978. SMIB's medium- and
long-term financial assistance /2 to SMI enterprises in the manufacturing sector
accounted for 25.8% of total fixed investment by those enterprises in 1977, as
compared with 21.6% for 1976 and 24.0% in 1975./3 Apart from its financing
activities, SMIB makes valuable qualitative contributions to the SMI sector
through the high standard of its operations, its frequent contacts with its
clients, its broad coverage of the SMI sector, its supervision work and its
extension services.
Summary of Financial Operations
4.18      SMIB's operations are summarized in Annex 5, Table 4.  At end-1978,
SMIB had a total outstanding loan portfolio of W 456.9 billion (US$942.0 mil-
lion). The most noteworthy feature of SMIB's financing activity is that it
is geared to meeting both the long-term and short-term resource requirements
of its clients. SMIB's term financing consists of equipment loans in domestic
and foreign currencies. Its short-term financing includes discounting of
trade bills, overdrafts, and general working capital loans. The latter two
account for the great bulk of SMIB's short-term operations (almost 94% in
1978) and are financed from deposits, while bill discounting is financed
through the Bank of Korea's rediscounting facility.
4.19      Equipment Loans.  At end-1978, SMIB's outstanding term (equipment)
loan portfolio amounted to W 173.8 billion (US$358.3 million) which represented
38.0% of its total outstanding loan portfolio. SMIB's cumulative commitments
of equipment loans since its inception in 1961 to end-1978 totaled
/1 By comparison, KDB accounted for 16.7% of all outstanding loans.
/2 On a commitment basis, for both foreign and domestic currency loans.
/3 These aggregates conceal substantial differences between various indus-
tries within the SMI manufacturing sector; for instance, 42.5% of total
SMI fixed investment in textiles was financed by SMIB in 1977 and 33.2%
for basic metals, but only 2.2% for SMI food and beverage industries (1978
estimates are not yet available).



- 27 -
W 271.4 billion (US$559.6 million) of which foreign currency loans accounted
for W 135.6 billion (US$279.6 million) or 49.9%. On a cumulative basis, this
proportion represents an increase in the foreign currency term loan commit-
ments made by SMIB, because, while SMIB did begin lending in foreign currency
in 1965, substantial foreign exchange resources became available to it only
relatively recently, starting in effect with the third ADB loan in 1973. The
growth of SMIB's term loan commitments has apparently not been constrained by
demand, as indicated by the fact that the 1978 level represented more than a
fourfold increase over that of 1975. Instead, the magnitude and growth trends
of term loan operations have on the whole been a function of resource avail-
ability. For instance, the decline in domestic currency commitments in 1975
was attributable to a shortage of long-term won resources made available to
SMIB by the Government, while, conversely, the subsequent increase in 1976 was
made possible by a cash subscription of W 5 billion to SMIB's share capital by
the Government and a high level of collections. Similarly the increase in
foreign currency commitments beginning in 1976 and increasing nearly threefold
in the two years to 1978, is a reflection of the availability of the two IBRD
loans. From this historical record, it can reasonably be assumed that,
subject to the availability of adequate resources, SMIB should face no
difficulty in continuing to expand its foreign currency term financing commit-
ments at its conservatively projected rate of 7.0% p.a. (para. 4.54).
4.20      Working Capital Loans.  During 1978, SMIB's lending for working
capital purposes increased by 43.9% over 1977, which itself increased by 31.5%
over 1976. The growth of SMIB's working capital financing reflects the growth
of deposits which is the main source of funds for these operations. The
outstanding working capital loan portfolio increased to W 283.1 billion
(US$583.7 million) by end-1978, which represents 62.0% of SMIB's total out-
standing loan portfolio.
Characteristics of SMIB's Lending Operations
4.21      Sectoral Distribution.  The manufacturing sector received nearly
all of SMIB's commitments of domestic currency term loans in the last three
years, accounting for an average of 99.8% of total commitments over that
period (Annex 5, Table 5). Within manufacturing, textiles and machinery were
the two dominant subsectors accounting respectively for 28.0% and 33.4% of
total commitments in 1978. Similarly, the manufacturing sector received the
overwhelming bulk of SMIB's commitments of foreign currency term loans in 1976
(98.1%) and 1977 (97.3%), although this declined sharply to 83.7% in 1978.
This decline was due to the rapid increase in that year of SMIB's lending to
construction enterprises. Within manufacturing, the textiles and machinery
subsectors dominate, although in 1978 their share of SMIB's total foreign loan
commitments did decline to 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively.
4.22      With about 69% of SMIB's term lending in 1976 and 1977 going to two
subsectors, textiles and metal products/machinery, SMIB potentially over-
exposed itself to cyclical or external factors affecting the performance
of these industries. SMIB is therefore reducing the concentration of its



- 28 -
term loan portfolio and so far this is reflected particularly in the share of
textiles falling from 26.7% of commitments in 1977 to only 19.4% (for foreign
currency) in 1978. However, there have been, and remain, valid reasons for
SMIB's relatively heavy concentration in these two subsectors. In the case of
textiles, for instance, it reflects to a degree SMIB's emphasis (as stated in
both its Act and Policy Statement) on assisting export-oriented and labor-
intensive industries. Of the 31 textile projects financed under the second
Bank loan (until end-1978), the average fixed investment cost per incremental
job was $14,900 (with several projects below the Bank UPP threshold of $6,270
for Korea, see Annex 5, Table 9) and 16 of these projects exported more than
50% of incremental output. Furthermore, the textile industry is expected to
grow at 11.9% p.a. until 1981, even though it will diminish in relative
importance within the Korean manufacturing sector and its share of total
exports is projected to decline from 36% in 1975 to 26% by 1981. In the case
of metal products/machinery industries, SMIB's high exposure reflects its
deliberate support of a subsector which has been designated by the Government
in the FFYP, together with heavy and chemical industries, as a high priority
and high growth subsector (a target of 21.6% p.a. until 1981), with a key role
in deepening Korea s industrial structure. Therefore, in this developmental
and macroeconomic context, the extent of SMIB's exposure in its term financing
of these two subsectors is justified.
4.23      Geographical Distribution.  As stated in its Development Strategy,
SMIB has endeavored to diversify the geographical distribution of its financing
operations (Annex 5, Table 5, Section C). There have been instances where
it has been modestly successful, for example in the South Chungchung Province
which increased its share from 5.0% of term loan commitments in 1977 to 7.4%
in 1978, and in SMIB's support of Saemaeul industries, notably in the North
Kyungsang and North Chungchung Provinces.   However, for foreign loan commit-
ments, the share of Seoul City has increased from 33.9% in 1976 to 35.9% in
1978, and similarly the share of Busan City has increased from 7.8% to 13.6%
over the same period. These figures do not indicate a high degree of success
with its diversification efforts and SMIB should endeavor to improve on this
performance./l However, if compared to the sources of SMIB's deposits, this
lending distribution still represents a net transfer of resources from these
large urban areas (which provide 73% of SMIB's deposits) to other regions.
Nevertheless, there remains scope for further geographical diversification of
SMIB's portfolio, particularly of its term loans which are not funded from
deposits. It is expected that the opening of additional branches in the
regions (para. 4.08) will enable SMIB to further this objective.
/1 In 1978, Seoul and Busan jointly accounted for 49.5% of SMIB's foreign
loan commitments, while it is estimated that these cities (in 1976)
accounted for about 35% of the total number of SMI establishments
in Korea, 44% of SMI employment and 43% of value added by SMI manufac-

4.24      Loan Size Distribution.  The average size of SMIB's domestic
currency term loans increased slightly from W 15.1 million (US$31,000) in 1976
to W 17.3 million (US$35,700) in 1978. Similarly, foreign currency term loans
increased from an average of W 79.4 million (US$164,000) in 1976 to
W 89.6 million (US$184,700) in 1978 (Annex 5, Table 5, Section D). For
foreign currency loans, this was associated with an increase in the average
proportion of total project costs financed by SMIB, from 53.7% in 1976 to
57.0% in 1978. Against the background of the increasing size of industrial
investments in Korea and price inflation, these trends indicate that SMIB has,
as a matter of deliberate policy, given increasing priority to the financial
needs of snaller enterprises.
4.25      Subborrower Asset Size.  Asset size data on a commitment basis is
only avalable for 1978 (Annex 5, Table 5, Section F). This indicates that (by
loan amount) most of SMIB's foreign exchange borrowers have total assets in
the range of W 300-500 million, or US$0.6-1.0 million. By number of loans,
borrowers with total assets of W 100-300 million (or US$0.2-0.6 million)
predominate. The diversity of SMIB's clients by asset size is satisfactory.
4.26      Employment Creation.  Between 1976 and 1978, SMIB has allocated its
domestic currency term loans increasingly to enterprises employing a larger
number of workers, with the 100-200 employee category accounting for about 37%
of SMIB's commitments by end-1978. For foreign currency term loans, the trend
has been mixed with SMIB's commitments to the smallest enterprises (in employ-
ment terms) of less than 50 employees increasing from 18% to 28% over this
period while commitments to enterprises employing over 200 workers also
increased from 16% to 35% over the same period (Annex 5, Table 5, Section G).
Between 1973 and 1978, it is estimated that SMIB-supported projects directly
created about 46,000 jobs. For projects receiving foreign currency loans from
SMIB, the average fixed investment cost per job increased from $6,030 in 1975
to $9,000 in 1976, $8,875 in 1977 and $12,200 in 1978 (Annex 5, Table 6).
These averages, however, conceal the considerable diversity of fixed investment
costs per job associated with projects selected for financing by SMIB. In
Annex 5, Table 9, for instance, an analysis of the labor-intensity of projects
financed by SMIB under the second Bank loan indicates that in 1978 there were
47 subprojects (out of 196 approved by end-1978), receiving US$7.8 million in
subloans from SMIB, with fixed investment costs per job below $6,270, mostly
for textiles and small metal workshops. These projects therefore qualify
under the 3ank-defined UPP threshold (1978 prices) for Korea and also under
the component within the second Bank loan which was designed to support, inter
alia, relatively labor-intensive enterprises (see para. 5.03).
4.27      As SMIB caters to the financial needs of medium as well as small
industries, the 1978 level of average fixed investment cost per job ($12,200)
can be considered appropriate, particularly if compared with equivalent
indicators of the other development finance institutions operating



- 30 -
in Korea./1 The rate of increase over the last few years is also considered
reasonable, particularly in view of three recent macroeconomic developments
in Korea. Firstly, there are increasing shortages of labor, both skilled
and unskilled. For example, a recent survey (Annex 5, Table 7) indicates
that SMI enterprises were operating with an average of only 92.8% of their
total labor requirements. As a result of the emergence of labor shortages,
it is understandable and appropriate that SMI entrepreneurs are increasingly
choosing more capital-intensive methods of production. Secondly, the increases
in the investment cost per job are at least in part caused by price inflation
in Korea (10% in 1977 and about 12% in 1978). This effect is compounded by
the fact that the investment costs in question, while expressed in US dollar
equivalents, in fact represent costs of imported equipment often purchased
from "strong" currency countries which had in recent years appreciated
vis-a-vis the dollar. The dollar equivalent figures are therefore artificially
inflated in a period of dollar depreciation. Thirdly, the rate of increase
of SMIB's average investment cost per job reflects not only the two afore-
mentioned factors, but also the recent sectoral shift in SMIB's foreign loan
operations undertaken in accordance with the Government's FFYP priorities,
notably from the relatively labor-intensive textile industry (para. 4.22) to
machinery and construction industries which are more capital intensive.
Finally in evaluating SMIB's performance in supporting labor-intensive
enterprises, it should be noted that investment cost per job figures exclude
indirect employment effects and there are indications that these are substan-
tial, particularly for SMI enterprises.
4.28      Contribution to Exports.  Between 1973 and 1978, the incremental
exports generated by projects receiving SMIB's foreign currency loans were
estimated at US$313.5 million, or 39% of incremental sales. This high level
of incremental exports is mainly attributable to the large number of textile
subprojects financed by SMIB, particularly in the early part of this period.
4.29      Annex 5, Table 2, indicates that exports from SMI industries
accounted for about 36% of total commodity exports and 40% of total industrial
exports from Korea over the last four years. SMIB continues to make its
contribution to Korea's export-led growth by specifically assisting export-
oriented enterprises in the SMI sector, as detailed in its Policy Statement
(Annex 3). In 1977, 18.7% of SMIB's foreign currency loan approvals (by
amount) was allocated to export-oriented projects which increased to 26.8%
in 1978 with the share of projects exporting more than three-fourths of
incremental sales increasing to nearly 14%. SMIB's performance in supporting
export-oriented subprojects is satisfactory.
/1 For instance, the average fixed investment cost per job for KDFC's sub-
projects (including those financed through KDLC and under its scheme
of cooperation with the Regional Commercial Banks, both designed to support
small industries) was $24,500 in 1977.



- 31 -
4.30      Other Features.  Due to the expansion of SMIB's operations (and
also partly due to inflation) the estimated annual monetary value of incremental
sales generated by SMIB's foreign loan subprojects has increased consistently
since 1973 to reach W 121.3 billion (US$250 million) in 1978, and, similarly,
the level of incremental value added has increased to reach W 41.6 billion
(US$85.7 million) in the same year (Annex 5, Table 6). With certain data
reservations, the changes in the average value added per additional employee
and the average value added/fixed assets ratio could be interpreted to suggest
that since 1973 the productivity of labor in SMIB's foreign loan subprojects
has increased and the productivity of capital has declined slightly./1 There
has also been a tendency for SMIB foreign loan commitments to new projects to
decline from 26.2% in 1976 to 21.4% by 1978 (the remainder going to expansion
projects), while the comparable figures for domestic currency term loans show
a slight increase from 11.6% to 16.4% (Annex 5, Table 5). While these levels
do not appear high, they are to a certain extent understated because of
definitional problems. SMIB's efforts to broaden its clientele have been
satisfactory, particularly for foreign currency loans of which 57% of the
amount outstanding at end-1978 was allocated to clients with only one loan
from SMIB. For working capital loans, the reverse was the case, with 43% of
the amount outstanding at end-1978 being allocated to clients with more than
three loans from SMIB, which is in keeping with normal banking practice.
4.31      In accordance with a specific objective in its Development Strategy,
SMIB has provided adequate support to the Saemaeul Program by financing 341
projects for an amount of W 13.7 billion (US$28.3 million) up to end-1978, of
which 45% was allocated to Saemaeul textile projects and 12% to metal and
machinery projects. In addition, SMIB conducted feasibility studies for
126 Saemaeul projects in 1977 and a further 20 in 1978.  In some cases, SMIB
has acted as an agent by financing government-designated Saemaeul projects,
and in 1979 a planned W 170 million of NIF funds will be channelled by the
Government through SMIB to support the Saemaeul program. Where possible, SMIB
has also promoted subcontracting arrangements, and hence the extent of indus-
trial linkages.  Under the second Bank loan, 27 projects operating under
subcontracting arrangements received financial assistance totalling
$8.5 million, or 18.3% of approvals under that loan. Finally, SMIB has
endeavored to support specialized SMI machinery industries (a priority sector)
and over the period 1976-78 assisted 44 clients in that industry with term
loans in both foreign and domestic currencies amounting to W 9.2 billion
(US$19.1 million). In 1979 a further 100 machinery enterprises will be desig-
nated by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI) for assistance, and SMIB
will act as agent for the Government in providing financial assistance to this
group. SMIB is also assisting Korean machinery industries indirectly by
financing the foreign exchange component of domestically procured capital
/1 Which on very restrictive assumptions is to be expected as the capital
intensity of SMIB-supported projects increases.



- 32 -
goods.J/ An amount of US$2.7 million (or about 6% of approvals) for 26
subprojects had been utilized in this manner under the second Bank loan by
end-1978.
Guarantee Operations
4.32      SMIB's guarantee operations are undertaken as a part of the services
it renders to its borrowers in connection with its commercial banking activi-
ties. Since 1975, almost all the guarantees issued have been short-term guar-
antees against trading documents, payment of import duties, etc. Long-term
guarantees are issued mainly to other financial institutions lending to
clients of SMIB whose collateral is already pledged to SMIB. Since 1975,
issuance of such long-term guarantees has been negligible. At end-1978
outstanding guarantees amounted to W 12.4 billion or US$25.6 million (Annex 5,
Table 8).
Equity Operations
4.33      SMIB does not intend, in the immediate future, to undertake equfty
operations. Most small entrepreneurs in Korea do not welcome institutional
equity participation and frequently do not keep accurate (or audited) finan-
cial accounts on which institutions like SMIB can rely. Moreover, the amount
of manpower which SMIB would have to devote to administer SM.I equity invest-
ments would be totally disproportionate to the benefit realized by either the
enterprise or SMIB. Finally, neither SMIB's financial structure nor ics
management/staff orientation allow it to prudently engage in operations as
inherently risky as providing venture capital.
Utilization of Bank Loan Nos. 1175-KO and 1507-KO
4.34      SMIB has approved the entire proceeds (US$30 m) of the first Barnk
loan (1175-KO; effective January 1976) for 138 subprojects. The Bank funds
accounted for 46% of the total investment cost of these projects and 76%
of the total fixed asset costs. These subprojects are expected to directly
generate about 6,700 new jobs at an average capital cost of US$8,700 per job.
SMIB's utilization of the first Bank loan has been satisfactory./2 As of
December 31, 1978, SMIB had approved US$44.3 million of the proceeds of the
second Bank loan (US$55 million; effective March 1978) for 196 subprojects.
These Bank resources constituted about 90% of SMIB's total financial assistance
(US$49.4 million) to these subprojects, which itself financed about 59% of
the US$83.9 million total subproject cost. SMIB's subloans ranged in size
from US$10,000 (brick-making) to US$1.37 million (construction), with an
average of US$226,300. The average total asset size of the subborrowers (at
the time of application to SMIB) was W 280 million (US$580,000) and
/1 A percentage of 60% of total cost, representing the estimated foreign
exchange component of domestically manufactured capital goods, is
eligible for financing under the second Bank loan No. 1507-KO.

see Annex 7 of Appraisal Report No. 1797-KO, dated November 30, 1977.



- 33 -
the average employment size was 72. From the full range of asset size and
employment characteristics, and subloan sizes, contained in Annex 5, Table 9,
it is evident that SMIB's allocation of the second Bank loan has not been
unduly skewed towards the 'medium' end of the SMI spectrum at the expense of
the 'small' end. The sectoral distribution shows a satisfactory diversity,
although certain industries were emphasized by SMIB in its support of key SMI
subsectors, such as construction (48 subprojects), textiles (31), metals (21),
plastics (16) and machinery (10). The bulk of the projects were for expansion
purposes, with only 17 being new projects. By virtue of an understanding with
the Bank, SMIB calculates FRRs and ERRs for projects above US$0.5 million
(which is also the free limit under the second Bank loan) and for the seven
subprojects in this category the FRRs ranged from 17.6% to 36.2%, averaging
24.4%, and the ERRs ranged from 31.6% to 83.2% averaging 51.5%. SMIB has
clearly allocated Bank funds to projects which are both economically and
financially viable.
4.35      Preliminary estimates indicate that 5,255 incremental jobs will be
directly generated by these subprojects at a fixed investment cost per job
ranging from US$1,760 (chemicals) to US$96,000 (feed mill) with a weighted
average /1 of US$11,130. These figures exclude indirect employment genera-
tion. The details contained in Annex 5, Table 9 indicate that the range of
investment costs per job is extremely large, with 47 projects receiving
US$7.8 million in foreign loans from SMIB (or 18% of SMIB's approvals from
1507-KO by end-1978) qualifying under the US$6,270 UPP limit (1978 prices)
set for Korea. SMIB's performance in utilizing the second Bank loan to
support, inter alia, relatively labor-intensive projects is very satisfac-
tory, especially in the light of several recent macroeconomic developments in
Korea (see para. 4.27).
SMIB's Extension Services
4.36      Shortly after its establishment, SMIB started providing managerial
assistance to SMI enterprises, initially on a limited basis but subsequently
expanded to include technical consultancy. In connection with these exten-
sion services, SMIB received financial and technical assistance (expatriate
advisors) from the UNDP/ILO between 1968 and 1974. An Extension Services
Department (ESD) was established, its staff trained, extension manuals
written, and SMIB was thereafter in a position to provide managerial, finan-
cial and technical consultancy services to SMI enterprises in Korea (not
restricted to SMIB clients).
4.37      The ESD at present numbers a total of 29 professionals of whom 2
are managerial, 8 are providing on-site and written consultancy services to
textile, machine tool, electronic and ceramic industries, and the remaining
19 provide procurement advice and prepare feasibility studies for the larger
foreign loan subprojects to be financed under IBRD/ADB lines of credit (2 of
those staff members are based in Busan, 1 in Taegu). In addition, the ESD
staff regularly conduct professional seminars for SMI enterprises. The
fees charged by SMIB for its consultancy services are nominal (a fixed
/1 Weighted by number of jobs.

W 20,000, or US$41, per plant visit) and do not allow cost recovery. The
amount of extension assistance has declined since the early 1970s, in 1978
only 155 /1 in-plant consulting cases were handled by SMIB (mostly in
ceramics, textiles and machinery), which is clearly short of the demand for
consultancy services from an estimated 25,600 SMI enterprises in Korea. SMIB
has been unable to fulfill its 1976/77 Development Strategy objective of
increasing its extension services principally because of its inability to
sufficiently enlarge its qualified ESD staff, which is largely due to the
unfavorable levels of compensation in the government banking sector compared
with those of the industrial private sector. (In general, the latter is about
twice the former.)
4.38      Apart from SMIB, there are an increasing number of alternative
sources of consultancy advice including private consulting firms, KOSTIC /2,
and some universities, all of which are considerably more expensive. The
Government has been aware of the need to considerably expand the availability
of effective and affordable technical assistance to SMII enterprises, and the
Small and Medium Enterprises Promotion Law which was passed in November 1978
envisages an alternative organizational structure for that purpose (details
in para. 2.15). It is expected that subsequent to the implementation of this
law SMIB will continue to provide some extension services and also use its
extension staff for feasibility studies of subprojects applying for SN'IIB
foreign currency financing.
C.  FINANCIAL POSITION, PERFORMANCE AND RESOURCES
Financial Position
4.39      Assets.  Balance sheets for 1974 to 1978 are summarized in Annex 5,
Table 10. At end-1978, SMIB's total assets stood at W 733.3 billion (US$1.51
billion) following an annual average growth of about 36% since 1974. At the
same date, SMIB's current assets amounted to W 484.2 billion (or 66% of total
assets) after growing at an average annual rate of about 44% since 1974. This
rapid increase in current assets is attributable to the growth of two main
components, cash and bank deposits, and short-term working capital loans,
which since 1974 grew at an average annual rate of 53% and 35% respectively.
At end-1978, SMIB's long-term assets amounted to W 230 billion (or 31% of
total assets), of which about 44% was accounted for by foreign currency term
loans. The breakdown of outstanding foreign loans by source indicates that
the proportion of SMIB's foreign operations funded by IBRD lines of credit
increased from 15.2% in 1976 to 21.8% in 1977 and 32.1% 1978. SMIB's total
loan portfolio, including short-term working capital loans, constituted 62% of
SMIB's total assets at end-1978. This level was slightly lower than the
average of 69% which prevailed from 1974 to 1977, principally because of the
rapid increase in cash holdings and SMIB's investment in securities.

- 35 -
4.40      Liabilities and Equity.  Of SMIB's total assets at end-1978,
63% were financed by current liabilities (48% by short-term deposits), 33% by
long-term liabilities, and 4% by equity. SMIB's current liabilities and
particularly its short-term deposits (which constituted an average of 74% of
current liabilities since 1974) have grown at an increasing annual rate
averaging 48% since 1974. This reflects SMIB's policy emphasis on the
increased mobilization of demand and savings deposits in the macroeconomic
context of raising domestic currency resources./l For example, at end-
1978, SMIB's total deposits amounted to W 471.6 billion compared with the
end-1977 level of W 307.2 billion. Of total deposits at end-1978, 75% was
current and 25% long-term and 52% represented household savings and 36%
corporate savings. SMIB's long-term liabilities totaled W 240.8 billion at
end-1978, of which 35.1% represented foreign currency borrowings, 49.1%
long-term savings deposits, and the remaining 15.8% long-term Government
funds (such as NIF and IRF). The foreign currency proportion of SMIB's long
term liabilities has steadily increased from 24.3% in 1974 to 26.7% in 1975,
and 35.1% in 1978. Borrowings from IBRD as a proportion of total
foreign currency borrowings increased from 15.0% in 1976 to 23.4% in 1977 and
38.3% in 1978, which is reasonable.
4.41      SMIB's paid-in capital amounted to W 20.06 billion (US$41.4 million)
at end-1978, having increased rapidly from the 1975 level of W 3.06 bil-
lion (US$6.3 million). This reflects recent Government contributions to
SMIB's share capital made in accordance with the Government's undertaking
under the first Bank loan to provide SMIB with additional equity capital as
needed to enable SMIB to maintain its long-term debt/equity ratio within the
agreed 10:1 limit. As a result of this, the long-term debt/equity ratio has
declined from 17.4:1 in 1975 to 9.8:1 in 1976, 8.3:1 in 1977 and 8.5:1 in
1978. It is recommended that this limit be maintained under the
proposed loan. As a result of the equity increases, SMIB's total debt/equity
ratio has also declined from 39.1:1 in 1975 to 27.4:1 in 1978 which
represents a substantial improvement and is not excessive for an institution
heavily involved in commercial banking operations and which derives a large
part of its resources from deposits, particularly short-term demand deposits.
Despite the recent increase in SMIB's current liabilities, its current ratio
has remained at 1.1 since 1976, which is satisfactory. SMIB's short-term
liquidity is controlled by the BOK's reserve requirements and is under the
supervision of the Superintendent of Banks. SMIB's debt service cover was
1.13 in 1978, which is adequate.
Financial Performance
4.42      Income and cash flow statements, and indicators of financial perfor-
mance, are summarized in Annex 5, Tables 11-12. In 1978, SMIB's gross income
reached W 73.2 billion (US$151.0 million), of which 77.4% was derived from
interest on all loans and 10.1% from interest on foreign currency term loans.
Gross income has increased at an average rate of 36% since 1974, which is
highly satisfactory. SMIB's net income stood at W 722 million (US$1.5
million) in 1978, a slight decrease over the 1977 level of W 763 million.
SMIB's profitability is modest with net income being only 0.1% of average
/1 SMIB offers potential savers an "Installment Savings Deposit" (up to
three years and even longer in some cases), which is a long-term savings
instrument unique in Korea.



- 36 
total assets in 1978, and declining as a proportion of average equity from
9.9% in 1974 to 3.3% in 1978 (which is partly due to the large increases in
SM'IB's equity since 1976). While the growth of gross income has been very
satisfactory, the net profitability of SMIB therefore remains modest. This
is due to the rapid growth of total expenses which, at an annual average of
36% between 1974=1978, was equal to the growth rate of gross income. In
particular, SMIB has made substantial provisions for doubtful accounts of
W 630 million in 1976 and W 1.2 billion in 1977, which reflects financial
prudence. In addition, the growth of administrative and general expenses,
notably salaries and wages, has been rapid, on account of: the nonprofit
development-oriented activities undertaken by SMIB, partly at the request of
the Government, such as extension services to nonclient companies, assistance
to Saemaeul projects and issuance of import licences; the mobilization of
petty savings from small depositors through a costly nationwide network of
branches and deposit offices; and the high overheads usually associated with
lending to small-scale enterprises. While these factors explain, and justify,
the high absolute level of SMIB's administrative expenses, SMIB has in 1978
succeeded in keeping these costs down to a relative level of only 3.3% of
average total assets (from 4.1% in 1975), which compares favorably with that
of other nationwide deposit money banks in Korea. The appropriation of
SMIB's net profits is subject to the prior approval of MIOF, and in 1978 an
amount of W 164 million was paid to Government as dividend despite the
reduced level of net profit of W 722 million. This new policy represents a
reversal of the negligible dividend payment to Government over the last 2
years 1976-77.
Quality of Portfolio
4.43      Annex 5, Tables 13=14 summarize SMIB's collection performance and
arrears situation from 1974 to 1978. SMIBs portfolio is of unusually good
quality considering that SMIB operates in the small business sector which is
generally considered high-risk, and considering its large clientele./1 At
end-1978, total arrears of principal and interest (for both short- and long-
term loans) was W 7.3 billion and represented only 1.6% of the total outstanding
portfolio, an improvement on the mid-1977 level of 3.5%. Principal affected
by arrears stood at W 7.8 billion or 1.7% of SMIB's total outstanding portfolio
in 1978, a substantial improvement over the mid-1977 level of 5.5%. The
repayment performance of equipment loans has been relatively better than that
of working capital loans, partly because the equipment loan portfolio (notably
the number of clients) is much smaller. Debt collection has been very satis-
factory, being above 99% for all loans since 1974. This generally excellent
repayment record of SMIB's clients is partly attributable to the continuing
strong performance of the Korean economy, notably of the SMI sector. However,
as more loans emerge from the grace period the collection ratio on foreign
equipment loans has slightly worsened to 94.9% in 1978, which is still quite
satisfactory. The sectoral analysis of SMIB's foreign loan arrears indicates
that 39.7% of the outstanding principal affected by arrears (at end-1978) was
in textiles, 17.1% in metal products and machinery and 15.5% in paper and
paper products, which reflects the sectoral distribution of SMIB's outstanding
foreign loan portfolio.
/1 At end-1978, SMIB's portfolio consisted of 42,000 accounts outstanding
with about 25,000 clients.



- 37 -
4.44      Despite the satisfactory existing situation, the sheer size of
SMIB's outstanding loan portfolio, of which W 95.3 billion (US$196.5 million)
or 21% was still in the grace period (at end-1978), and the increase in
number of clients, suggest that some arrears must be expected to continue and
additional arrears to emerge. Since 1975, SMIB has made provisions exceeding
actual write-offs in accordance with the agreement reached with the Bank at
the time of appraisal of the first Bank loan, No. 1175-KO. In 1977, the
level of provisions reached W 1.22 billion as compared with write-offs of
W 226 million in that year.  SMIB has also agreed with the Bank, at the time
of negotiations of the second Bank loan to instruct the external auditors to
certify the adequacy of the provisions for doubtful accounts based on the
auditors' review of SMIB's portfolio in arrears and its collateral. This has
been implemented and in 1978, on the basis of the low level of arrears and
write-offs and taking into account the large appropriations into the special
reserves, the auditors have approved a reversal of the provision allowance
of W 858 million.
Terms and Conditions of Lending
4.45      The terms of SMIB's borrowings, and its relending rates are sum-
marized in Annex 5, Table 15. The lending rates charged by SMIB are not set
independently by SMIB's Board, but are regulated by the Government through
the Monetary Board and apply to all banking and financial institutions. On
the domestic currency side, a dual interest rate structure exists. The
"general lending rates" applicable to operations financed out of SMIB's own
funds (deposits and equity) stood at 18.5% p.a. for prime enterprises and 19%
p.a. for other borrowers as of July 1, 1978 (following a general increase in
interest rates effective June 13, 1978). SMIB charges "preferential lending
rates" on loans made out of various specialized funds, such as the NIF (15%
p.a. for loans up to 3 years, 17% p.a. for 3-8 years) and the SMI Promotion
Fund (13.5% p.a.). As SMIB also contributes its own resources to these
funds, (15% of SMIB's annual incremental deposits are contributed to the NIF)
which could otherwise be lent at an average rate of 18.6% p.a., it receives
an interest subsidy from the Government of about 4%. On the foreign currency
side, SMIB normally onlends the funds with a spread of two percentage points
(maximum allowed by Government) above its own borrowing rate /1 and with the
full foreign exchange risk borne by subborrowers. The weighted average /2
interest rate charged on SMIB's outstanding foreign currency loans was about
10.08% p.a. in 1978. This is not substantially different from the average
levels prevailing during the three years since 1976 and despite an average
annual rate of inflation of about 11% (wholesale prices) over that period,
these SMIB interest rates can be considered to have been satisfactorily
positive in real terms because the subborrowers bear the full foreign
/1 This system is geared mainly to controlling the spreads earned by the
financial institutions, but in practice results in arbitrary differen-
tials in SMIB's onlending rates (at any point in time) which directly
reflect the different rates charged by SMIB's various official
sources of foreign exchange (e.g., the Bank and ADB). Alternative
schemes will be explored by the Bank's forthcoming financial sector
review mission to Korea.

exchange risk./1 This level of foreign exchange onlending rates is also in
line with those charged by KDB.
Resources
4o46      Domestic Currency.  SMIB's resources position at end-1978 is shown
in Annex 5, Table 16. At that date, total domestic currency resources
amounted to W 555.8 billion (US$1.14 billion) of which deposits accounted for
84.8%, while equity and borrowings from Government and BOK accounted for 4.6%
and 10.6% respectively. An amount of W 181.9 billion, or 32.7% of SMIB's
total domestic currency resources, were long-term, of which savings deposits
were the largest component reaching W 118.2 billion. The remaining
W 373.9 billion were short-term domestic currency resources, where again the
demand and savings deposits were the largest component at W 353.4 billion (or
94% of short-term domestic resources). At end-1978, W 68.4 billion
(US$141.1 million equivalent) of short-term and W 11.8 billion (US$24.3 mil-
lion equivalent) of long-term domestic resources were available for commitment.
4.47      Foreign Currency.  SMIIB was authorized to make foreign exchange
loans in 1964. By end-1978, it had mobilized a cumulative total of
W 142.8 billion, of which nearly 29% was borrowed from IBRD and a further 35%
from ADB. Starting with its first foreign borrowing of $6.25 million equiv-
alent /2 from KfW in 1965, SMIB had borrowed a total of W 49.8 billion from
KfW, OECF, ADB, USAID and the Exim Bank of Japan by 1973, which represented
only 34.8% of total borrowings obtained by end-1978. It is evident that
SMIB's foreign currency operations escalated after 1973, with the availability
of IBRD and ADB funds. Apart from 'official' foreign exchange funds, SMiIB is
also an agent for channelling the Government's 'Korea Foreign Exchange' (KFX)
funds. The KFX scheme, started in 1976, is sponsored by 1OF and funded from
the foreign exchange resources of the Central Bank (BOK). These funds are
onlent at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.5% p.a. SMIB's foreign currency
resource position as of end-1978 indicates that only W4.0 billion (US$8.2
million) was available for commitments, which, based on projections and taking
into account foreign exchange funds available from other sources, implies that
SMIB's foreign resources will need to be supplemented by late 1979.
Audit
4.48      Since 1965, SMIB's accounts have been audited by Chong Un Accounting
Company, a Korean firm associated with Touche Ross & Co. In 1975 and 1976
/1  This cost has been substantial, particularly because of the mix of
foreign currencies disbursed, for instance under the IBRD loans, 75%
of the amount outstanding of Loan No. 1175-KO at April 30, 1979 was
denominated in Deutsche mark (38%), Swiss Francs (22%), and Japanese Yen
(15%), and for Loan No. 1507-KO the share of strong currencies was even
larger (93%), consisting of Swiss Francs (54%), and Japanese Yen (39%).

the auditors issued a qualified opinion, pointing out that the employees'
retirement liability had been underestimated. This, however, represented a
minor qualification and other aspects of SMIB's accounts were found satisfac-
tory. In 1977, SMIB appointed San Kyong & Co. as its auditors, a company
acceptable to the Bank. The 1978 audit report found SMIB's accounts satis-
factory but repeated the minor qualification relating to the underestimation
of employees' retirement liability. This has subsequently been corrected.
D.  PROSPECTS AND RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
Business Prospects
4.49      The outlook for the Korean economy in general and the manufacturing
sector in particular remains favorable;/1 GNP is expected to increase by 9.2%
annually, with a growth rate of 14.2% p.a. in the manufacturing sector. The
growth of the economy will continue to be mainly export-led; exports of goods
and services are projected to increase 16.8% annually with manufactured
exports providing 94% of incremental exports over the period 1977-81 (of
which the SMI sector is expected to contribute about 40%, see Annex 5, Table
2). An annual increase in gross fixed investment of 7.8% is required to
sustain this rate of GNP growth and manufacturing investmett is projected to
account for 26.7% of total investment expenditures during the Fourth Plan
Period, which represents an increase from its share of 24.6% during 1972-76.
The FFYP also emphasized the need for deepening the structure of Korean
industries, notably through an increase in the investment share of the
machinery industries (together with heavy and chemical industries), for
which SMIB has already expanded its financial assistance (para. 4.22).
4.50      In this macro-economic context, and within the limits of its
assumed domestic and foreign currency resource availability, SMIB has pro-
jected its future operations over 1979-82 /2 on the basis of detailed and
reasonable assumptions./3 Total commitments (both equipment and working
/1  With respect to most economic indicators, the Korean economy has performed
better than expected during 1977-78 and exceeded the Fourth Five Year Plan
targets for those years.
/2  SMIB's operational and financial projections were originally prepared in
mid-1978 for the five year period 1978-82. Subsequently the 1978 figures
have been converted to "actuals" and hence the projections only cover the
four year period 1979-82, which is sufficient for the purpose at hand.
/3  Of which the more important assumptions are:  (i) a steady annual increase
of 15% in SMI investment in fixed assets; (ii) an increase in SMIB's
equipment loans as a proportion of total SMI investment requirements from
26% in 1977 to 39% and 44% thereafter (this is due to the availa-
bility of SMIPF resources); (iii) an increase in foreign exchange opera-
tions conservatively estimated at 7.0% p.a.; and (iv) an increase in
total deposits of 29% annually with long-term savings deposits reaching
27% of the total, a reflection of SMIB's specific resource mobilization
efforts.

capital loans/1) are expected to reach W 1,190.0 billion (US$2.45 billion
equivalent) over the four-year period, with foreign loan commitments reaching
W 189.8 billion (15.9% of the total) or US$391.3 million (Annex 5, Table 17).
Total disbursements are expected to reach W 1,188.0 billion. Average annual
growth rates for total commitments and disbursements are expected to be
nearly the same at about 18%. The achievement of these targets will depend
not so much on staff capacity or paid-in equity capital, which are expected
to be satisfactory and commensurate with SMIB's projected volume of opera-
tions, as on SMIB's capacity to mobilize additional resources, particularly
on the foreign currency side.
Financial Forecasts
4.51      SMIB's financial performance and structure are expected to remain
satisfactory over the next four years (Annex 5, Tables 18-20). Net income is
projected to grow from W 722 million in 1978 to W 17.3 billion in 1982
(representing 0.1% and 0.9% of average total assets respectively) principally
due to an increase in gross spread from 3.5% of average total assets to 4.6%
over that period. SMIB's gross income is expected to increase from W 73.2 bil-
lion in 1978 of which 77.4% originated from interest on loans, to W 251.2 bil-
lion in 1982, of which 87.9% will originate from interest on loans.
4.52      SMIB's total assets are projected to increase from W 733.3 billion
in 1978 to W 2,135.5 billion in 1982, an average annual growth of nearly 31%.
Over this period, SMIB's total loan portfolio as a proportion of its total
assets is expected to increase from 62.3% in 1978 to 67.9% in 1982, while the
share of equipment loans will be constant at about 23%. The ratios of finan-
cial performance show a satisfactory and improving trend. Due to continued
increases in SMIB's equity capital, as projected, the long-term debt/equity
ratio will remain below 8.5:1, well within the contractual limit of 10:1. The
current ratio is projected to remain above 1:1.
Domestic Currency Resource Position and Requirements
4.53      SMIB's resource projections are shown in Annex 5, Table 21.  Cumula-
tive domestic currency commitments over the 1979-82 period are expected to
reach W 1,000.1 billion, consisting of W 324.2 billion for equipment loans and
W 675.9 billion for working capital loans./2 SMIB plans to raise total new
resources of W 1,076.3 billion of which W 338 billion are long-term and the
remaining W 738.3 billion short-term./3 The Government is the largest source
of long-term resources, via its subscription to equity capital, the NIF, and
the new SMIPF,/3 which will become operational in 1979. The net increase in

- 41 -
deposits, both demand and savings, are the largest source of short-term
resources, accounting for 85.2% of the total available, which represents a
commendable effort on SMIB's part to mobilize domestic resources.
Foreign Currency Resource Requirements
4.54      Annex 5, Table 17 shows that SMIB's cumulative foreign currency
commitments are projected at US$391.3 million between 1979-82. SMIB envisages
mobilizing US$413 million in foreign currency borrowings over the period
1979-82, of which 30% will be from the Bank, 42% from ADB, and the remaining
28% from the Korean Government under the KFX scheme. Being a "small and
medium industry" development bank rather than a conventional DFC, and having
access to official sources of foreign exchange since only recently, SMIB does
not envisage mobilizing foreign commercial resources in the near future. An
analysis of the recent growth of foreign loan commitments, notably the rapid
increase after 1977, indicates clearly that SMIB's past foreign lending
operations and the projections for the future are largely a function of
available resources (para. 4.19). The average annual rate of increase of 7.0%
for foreign loan commitments between 1979-82 is therefore very conservative
relative to potential demand for SMIB's financing, but probably realistic on
the basis of resource availability. As a result of this modest foreign
resource availability, foreign equipment loan approvals are expected to
decline from 42% of SMIB's total equipment lending in 1979 to 33% in 1982.
5. THE PROPOSED BANYK LOAN
Recommendations and Justification
5.01      SMIB's performance continues to be highly satisfactory from both
the institutional and developmental points of view. With its operational
capability, especially its satisfactory project appraisal and follow-up work,
SMIB has been an efficient intermediary for allocating funds to Korea's key
industrial sector. In particular, given the functional demarcation between
the development finance institutions operating in Korea, SMIB has been the
only intermediary channelling Bank funds exclusively to the small and medium
industry (SMI) sector. This sector has made significant contributions to the
achievement of Korea's economic objectives, particularly that of export-led
growth. Specifically, an average of 36% of total commodity exports and 40%
of total industrial exports originated in the SMI sector over the last four
years, reaching US$4.6 billion in 1978 (para. 2.03). The SMI sector also
accounted for about 45% of employment in the manufacturing sector in 1977,
and the subsector has also contributed to the regional dispersal of employment
opportunities (paras. 2.05-2.06). Its importance is further emphasized in
the current Fourth Five-Year Plan (FFYP), which points to the crucial role to
be played by SMIs in deepening the industrial structure and complementing



- 42 -
large-scale manufacturing enterprises through extensive subcontracting
arrangements. /1 As of end-1978, total Bank resources of US$85 million
(on a commitment basis) have been made available through SMIB to 334 projects
in the SMI manufacturing, transportation and construction industries.
5.02      A Bank loan of US$60 million is recommended which is expected to
finance about 32% of SMIB's estimated foreign currency commitments over the
two-year period mid-1979/mid-1981, with the balance to be met by additional
borrowings from the ADB and KFX (Annex 5, Table 21).   This loan will enhance
SMIB's foreign currency resources available for allocation to the SMI sector.
SMIB is not expected to be able to mobilize foreign commercial resources in
the foreseeable future principally because it is a small and medium industry
development bank rather than a conventional DFC and also because it has had
access to official sources of foreign exchange since only recently (1976, in
the case of the Bank). The mobilization of foreign currency funds from
official sources will complement SMIB's own successful efforts at mobilizing
domestic currency resources (both short- and long-term; para. 4.40), which it
intends to emphasize further in its future operations. /2 Apart from the
transfer of resources, the Bank's institution-building impact on SMIB has
been substantial. Under the two previous loans, the Bank has persuaded the
Government to strengthen SMIB's capital structure (para. 4.41), urged SMIB to
formulate and implement short-term development objectives (para. 4.10),
improve its economic analysis of projects including the calculation of
ERRs for selected projects, carry out SMI-related studies, introduce a
systematic project monitoring system, and improve SMIB's financial practices
including the establishment of adequate portfolio provisions (para. 4.44).
The proposed loan will enable the Bank to continue assisting SMIB in its
effort of improving the economic and operational impact of SMIB's lending,
by inter alia, urging SMIB to improve on its performance in the geographic
dispersal of its loans through stepping up the level of its branch
operations /3 and encouraging SMIB to intensify the provision of extension
services to SMIs through the new Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corpo-
ration (SMIPC), within the framework of the recent legislation on SMI promo-
tion of December 1978 (para. 2.15). In addition, the loan will also enable
the Bank to continue assisting small industrial projects in Korea which, due
to their size, are not usually financed by the other two intermediaries (KDFC
and KDB) assisted by the Bank. An analysis of the 196 subprojects financed

production at an acceptable level.

/3 Again specified in the Development Strategy (Annex 4).



- 43 -
under the second Bank loan (Annex 5, Table 9) indicates that this objective
has been satisfactorily achieved. SMIB's subborrowers on average had a total
asset size of only W 280 million (US$580,000) and 72 employees. The average
size of SMIB's subloans under the second Bank loan was US$226,300, and the
average size of all SMIB's loans, both domestic and foreign, increased only
slightly between 1976 and 1978 (para. 4.24), which clearly indicates that
SMIB has, as a matter of deliberate policy, given increasing priority to the
financial needs of smaller enterprises. Apart from being smaller, SMIB's
subprojects have also been more labor-intensive than those financed by the
other intermediaries, with a weighted average of fixed investment costs per
job of US$11,130 in 1978. In the light of the current macroeconomic context
(para. 4.27) this indicates that SMIB's performance in supporting relatively
labor-intensive investment projects has been satisfactory. Comparable
figures for KDFC and KDB are considerably higher./I SMIB's subprojects under
the second Bank loan are expected to generate about US$25 million in incremental
exports. The FRRs and ERRs, calculated for projects receiving foreign
currency loans in excess of US$0.5 million, had an average FRR of 24.4% and
ERR of 51.5% (para. 4.34). These rates of return, when considered together
with the favorable employment and export effects of SMIB's subprojects,
indicate that the Bank resources made available to SMIB have been allocated
to projects which are financially and economically viable. It is expected
that the subprojects to be financed under the proposed loan to SMIB will
yield similar or greater financial and economic benefits./2 Under the second
Bank loan, a $20 million component was included to ensure that SMIB would not
neglect the financial requirements of small enterprises relative to those of
medium-sized enterprises, and would also finance some labor-intensive sub-
projects, thereby contributing to employment creation where appropriate. A
similar component will be earmarked under the proposed loan (para. 5.03). In
summary, the proposed loan will enable the Bank to continue its mutually
beneficial relationship with SMIB, which is relatively recent, dating back
only to 1975.
Main Features of the Loan
5.03      Component for financing small, labor-intensive projects.  SMIB has
made a deliberate effort under the second Bank loan to assist small entrepre-
neurs and relatively labor-intensive projects. The results have been satis-
factory (paras. 4.34-4.35). It is important that under the proposed loan
SMIB should continue its efforts to reach smaller enterprises (in terms of
/1 For example, in 1977 the average size of KDFC's subloans was US$1.1 mil-
lion and its average fixed investment cost per job was US$24,500. KDB's
subprojects are generally comparable to, or larger than, KDFC's.
/2 In particular, it is expected that the estimated 260 subprojects under
the proposed loan will directly create about 7,750 incremental jobs,
based on projections of expected fixed investment cost and taking into
account the proposed component (para. 5.03).



- 44 -
total assets) and projects with a capital/labor ratio which is appropriate in
the prevailing macroeconomic conditions (para. 4.27) and in harmony with
Korea's employment objectives. It is therefore recommended that a component
of US$25 million (or 42% of the proposed loan amount) be earmarked for
financing specifically: (a) enterprises with fixed assets not exceeding
US$300,000;/1 or (b) projects generating employment at a fixed investment
cost per job not greater than US$8,500. The proposed US$300,000 (equivalent
to W 145.5 million) fixed asset ceiling is well within the W 500 million
(US$1 million) total asset limit under Korea's official definition of small
and medium industries. It is also in line with the US$250,000 limit on fixed
assets suggested in the Bank report "Employment Creation and Small-Scale
Enterprise Development" (March 1977) adjusted for subsequent inflation. The
proposed US$8,500 limit on fixed investment cost per job appears appro-
priate, indeed on the low side, considering the increasing scarcity of labor,
the structural shift of industry towards the high priority but more capital-
intensive subsectors, and also the fact that SMIB's commitments under the
proposed loan will take place mostly in 1980 so that an inflation factor
must be taken into account. Apart from its employment creation objectives,
this limit on fixed investment cost per job should again serve (as under the
second Bank loan) to explicitly focus SMIBs appraisal analysis on the appro-
priateness of the capital/labor balance in its subprojects. Based on an
analysis of available data on recent subprojects, SMIB is expected, with a
reasonable but not excessive effort on its part, to be able to utilize fully
the special component as described above.
5.04      Financing of foreign exchange component of domestic equipment.
Apart from direct imports, it is recommended that SMIB be authorized to use
the proceeds of the proposed loan to finance the foreign exchange component of
domestically manufactured or procured capital goods, estimated at 60% of their
total cost./2 About 6% (or US$2.7 million) of the second Bank loan had been
utilized in this manner by end-1978. The continuation of this authority under
the proposed loan should increase SMIB's potential for financing smaller
projects as these often require domestically produced rather than imported
capital goods, and it will also enhance SMIB's current efforts to intensify
its assistance to SMI machinery industries (para. 4.31).
/1 At time of loan application to SMIB.
/2 An updating survey of 29 SMI enterprises undertaken by SMIB in November
1978 indicated that an average of 60% was still applicable over a wide
range of manufacturing industries.



- 45 -
5.05      Free limit.  It is recommended that the free limit of US$0.5 mil-
lion, which was set under the two previous Bank loans, be maintained. The
maintenance of this free limit does not imply any dissatisfaction with SMIB's
project appraisal work which remains satisfactory. Instead it is a reflec-
tion of the basically unchanged size distribution of SMIB's subloans, most of
which have remained well below US$0.5 million. Under the proposed free limit
it is estimated that about ten to twelve subprojects accounting for approxi-
mately 15% of the total loan amount would still require Bank review prior to
approval.
5.06      Ceiling on subloans and size of subborrowers.  Under the second
Bank loan the limits on individual subloans and on total assets of eligible
subborrowers were increased to respectively US$1.5 million and W 1 billion in
recognition of the increased size of industrial projects in Korea and of a
Government decision to raise the total asset limit for borrowers eligible for
SMIB's foreign exchange financing. These limits are still considered appro-
priate and it is recommended that they be maintained under the proposed
loan.
5.07      Debt/equity limit.  Under the first Bank loan a limit of ten times
its equity was set on SMIB's long-term debt (with all government loans
and all deposits with maturity exceeding one year to be included in debt).
Furthermore, the Government undertook specifically (as recorded in the Guaran-
tee Agreement) to provide SMIB with additional equity capital as needed
in future to enable SMIB to keep its debt/equity ratio within the 10:1 limit.
The same limit was maintained under the second Bank loan. It is recommended
that this debt/equity limit of 10:1 be maintained under the proposed loan and
that the Government's undertaking as described above be recorded again in the
Guarantee Agreement.
5.08      Relending rate.  SMIB intends to onlend the proceeds of the pro-
posed Bank loan at an interest rate of 2 percentage points above its own
borrowing rate (i.e. 9.9% p.a. assuming a Bank lending rate of 7.9% p.a.).
This spread of 2 percentage points is adequate to cover the cost incurred by
SMIB in processing foreign currency loans and is in line with the general
practice of government-owned development finance institutions in Korea in
relending the proceeds of their borrowings from institutional sources (IBRD,
ADB et al.)/1 Provided that the rate of inflation is maintained within 7%
p.a. as projected in the Fourth Plan, SMIB's onlending rates would represent
positive real rates of interest. However, should the inflation rate exceed
/1 At any point in time, this practice results in arbitrary differentials in
SMIB's onlending rates which merely reflect the different rates charged
by SMIB's various official sources of foreign exchange (para. 4.45).
This matter will be reviewed with the Korean authorities in the context
of the forthcoming Bank financial sector review mission scheduled for
FY80.



- 46 -
Fourth Plan projections,/1 the lending rate would still be appropriate
considering that the subborrowers bear the full foreign exchange risk.
5.09      Amortization schedule.  As is usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the
proposed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule which would sub-
stantially reflect the aggregate of the repayment schedules of the individual
subloans made by SMIB. The loan is expected to be fully repaid within 17
years including a grace period of 3 years. The estimated disbursement
schedule is presented in Annex 5, Table 22.
Agreements and Understandings Reached at Negotiations
5.10      During loan negotiations the Bank reached agreement with:
(a) the Government to the effect that it will continue to provide SMIB
with additional equity capital as needed in the future to maintain
SMIB's long-term debt/equity ratio within the 10:1 limit;
(b)  SMIB on:
(i)  a component of US$25 million under the proposed loan for
financing enterprises with fixed assets not exceeding
US$300,000 /2 or projects that would create additional employ-
ment at a fixed investment cost per job not exceeding US$8,500
(para. 5.03);
(ii) the maintenance of the long-term debt/equity limit at 10:1
(para. 5.07);
(iii) the financing of 60% of the cost of domestically procured
capital goods representing the estimated foreign exchange
component of such goods (para. 5.04);
(iv) the maintenance of a subproject free limit of US$0.5 million
(para. 5.05); and
(v)  the maintenance of a US$1.5 million ceiling on the size
of individual subloans and a limit of W 1 billion on the total
asset size of eligible borrowers (para. 5.06).
5.11      In addition the Bank reviewed and reached understandings with SMIB
on the objectives outlined by SMIB in its Statement of Development Strategy
for 1979/80 (Annex 4).

KOREA
THE SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY BANK
Policy Statement
(Adopted by Board of Policy on November 13, 1969
and Amended on May 30, 1974)
I. Economic Role
SMIB shall assist in the economic development of Korea in conformity
with its purposes as stated in the Small and Medium Industry Bank Act and
By-Laws and in accordance with the Government's plans, policies and priorities.
In order to accomplish this objective, SMIB will promote the development of
privately controlled medium and small enterprises (as defined from time to
time by the Government of the Republic of Korea) in the country by (i) provid-
ing various types of financial assistance to them in the form of short-term
credits for working capital purposes, medium- and long-term loans, equity
participation, guarantees and underwritings; (ii) providing technical and
managerial consulting services; and (iii) undertaking promotional activities
in the identification and development of new projects. The term "privately-
controlled" enterprises will be taken to mean enterprises which are privately
operated and managed and in which the controlling interest is held by private
investors. The mere fact that such enterprises have secured loans from
government financial institutions, or that the Government holds a minority
equity position will not exclude such enterprises from receiving financial
assistance from SMIB.
II. Development Policies
In extending its assistance SMIB will give preference to enter-
prises which will effectively contribute to broadening the base of the
national economy and improving the balance of payments. Priority will be
given to:
(a) export industries as designated by the Government;
(b) import-substitution industries and industries producing
raw materials necessary for export and import-substitution
industries;
(c) specialized industries or industries ancillary to large
firms and machinery industries;
(d) industries with potential for exports or import-substitution;
(e) industries which will develop new products; and
(f) indigenous industries and industries which make use of labor-
intensive technologies.

ANNEX 3

III. General Policies and Procedures
(a) SMIB will carry out its operations in accordance with sound
management and business principles and practices. It will
increase its operations in the field of development finance.
(b) SMIB will extend financial assistance only for projects which
appear viable from economic, technical and financial points
of view. SMIB will pay special attention to the quality of
the management of the enterprise and to the market prospects
of the project.
(c) SMIB may assist applicants in the preparation of project
applications and feasibility studies.
(d) SMIB will require eligible borrowers to finance a reasonable
portion of the total project cost from their own resources to
ensure that they have a reasonable stake in the projects
financed by SMIB.
(e) Borrowers must not be in arrears in the repayment of either
principal or interest on any existing loan.
(f) For the projects assisted by it, SMIB will ensure availability
of all financial requirements, including working capital, for
the successful implementation of the project.
(g) SMIB will appropriately supervise the use of its funds, the
progress of the project financed and the performance of the
enterprise so as to ensure that remedial action is taken
when problems arise. Whenever necessary, SMIB will endeavor to
provide the necessary technical services to such enterprises.
(h) SMIB will determine the repayment period of loans, including
grace period, in accordance with the nature and the individual
circumstances of the project.
IV. Financial Guidelines
(a) SMIB will finance its medium- and long-term operations from its
long-term resources and it shall endeavor to diversify its invest-
ments in terms of the type of industries, the location of such
industries and the type of financing.
(b) SMIB will not seek to control any of the enterprises in which
it has invested nor will it participate in the management of
such enterprises except for the purpose of safeguarding its
interest.

ANNEX 3
Page 3
(c)  In accordance with sound banking practices, SMIB will secure
its loans and guarantees with appropriate collateral from its
client; but SMIB will have due regard to its developmental func-
tions in the Korean economy. In making investments in equity
participations and in underwriting stocks and debentures of its
clients, SMIB will be guided by considerations of technical feasi-
bility, financial viability and economic justification of the
projects and enterprises so assisted.
(d)  SMIB will not subscribe to stocks in excess of its unimpaired
paid-up capital, legal reserves and surplus. As a rule, SMIB's
equity participation in any single enterprise shall not exceed
25% of paid-in capital stock of an enterprise. SMIB's equity
investment shall serve mainly as a catalytic agent for the estab-
lishment of new enterprises and SMIB will endeavor to dispose of
such equity investments as soon as this becomes feasible at a fair
price.
(e)  SMIB's total commitments in any one single enterprise in whatever
form, i.e. loans, equity participation, guarantees or a combination
thereof, will normally not exceed 25% of the sum of its unimpaired
paid-in capital, legal reserves and surplus.
(f)  In general, SMIB's total commitments in any one single enterprise
will not exceed 60% of the total assets of the enterprise including
SMIB's own investments. Exceptions to the above may be made in
respect to SMIB's financing of small and medium industry coopera-
tives, local governments and nonprofit seeking corporations.
V. Accounting
(a)  SMIB will maintain accounting records adequate to reflect its
business operations and affairs in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and standards.
(b)  SMIB will engage a qualified and independent public accountant
to audit its books and financial statements every year.
VI. Provisions and Reserves
(a)  SMIB will annually make appropriate allocations to a provision
for the protection against bad debts and investments until such
provision equals 10% of SMIB's portfolio.
(b)  SMIB will allocate at least 25% of its annual net profits to a
reserve fund until such a reserve fund reaches a sum equal to
its paid-up capital.

THE SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY BANK
Outline of Development Strategy for 1980/81 /_
In parallel with the projected expansion of its financing opera-
tions in the two-year period 1980/81, SMIB will endeavor to enhance its impact
on the Small and Medium Industry sector through the implementation of the
developmental objectives outlined below.
(a)  It is SMIB's policy and intention, apart from financing medium-
sized enterprises (as presently defined) to make special efforts to
seek out and assist an increasing number of small enterprises (in
terms of total assets) and relatively labor-intensive projects (in
terms of the capital:labor ratio). This emphasis on financing
small, relatively labor-intensive projects will apply to the use by
SMIB of IBRD resources as well as its other resources.
(b)   SMIB will endeavour to increase the mobilization of household and
storeholder savings, particularly emphasizing relatively long-term
deposits, in an effort to augment its domestic currency resources.
This is intended to be in part achieved by expanding its branch
network.
(c)  SMIB will continue to gradually increase the proportion of its
financing to areas outside metropolitan Seoul and Busan in an
effort to promote a more even distribution of industry and employ-
ment opportunities in Korea.  SMIB will endeavour to reduce the
proportion of Seoul and Busan to about 45% for the 1980/81
period.
(d)  SMIB will actively assist the small and medium-sized enterprises in
the machinery subsector which has been specified as a high priority
subsector by the Government in the Fourth Five-Year Plan.
(e)  In connection with (d) and (a), and in an effort to deepen the
industrial structure in Korea, SMIB will, where appropriate,
actively encourage and promote subcontracting arrangements.
(f)  SMIB will continue to give high priority in its financial and
technical assistance to small rural industries within the Saemaeul
Program.
(g)  SMIB will strengthen its research activities, with particular
emphasis on sector and market studies for small and medium-sized
industries, and will consistently apply the findings of these
studies in its operations.
/1 The previous Development Strategy agreed between the Bank and SMIB covered
the two-year period 1978/79.
