CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                  Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania
Beneficiary Agencies:      Mauritanian Bank for Development and Commerce
(BMDC)
Mauritanian Carpet Bureau (0TM), and
Training and Professional Improvement Center
(CFPP)
Ministry of Industry
Amount:                    SDR 5.4 million (US$5.25 million)
Terms:                     Standard
Onlending Terms:           1.  US$3.8 million of the credit would be relent by
the Government to BMDC for 20 years, including 5
years of grace, at 7% interest per annum. The
standard IDA commitment fee of 0.5X would apply to
BMIC. BMDC would onlend to final borrowers at an
interest rate of 11% per annum. The Government
would bear the foreign exchange risk against a 1%
per annum fee paid by the final borrowers in
addition to the interest rate.
2. Of the balance of US$1.45 million, US$1.2
million would be passed on by the Government as
grants to (i) BMDC (US$430,000) for financing
technical assistance and training; (ii) 0TM
(US$460,000) for support to artisan carpet weavers;
(iii) CFPP (US$310,000) for accounting training.
The remaining US$250,000 would be used by the
Ministry of Industry to finance an industrial
sector review.
Project Description:       The project would comprise five components:
(a) A line of credit to finance private small and
medium enterprises through BMDC.
(b) Technical assistance to further strengtben
BMDC's institutional capacity.



- iii -
(c) Assistance to OTM to train and equip 300
additional artisan carpet weavers and to
provide them with technical advice and
marketing assistance.
(d) Assistance to CFPP to train accountants working
for the corporate sector.
(e) Assistance to the Ministry of Industry to carry
out a review of the industrial sector relating
to both policy and institutional issues.
Benefits and Risks:       The benefits of the project would be (i) at the
enterprise level to help create or expand about 20
small- and medium-scale enterprises which would
employ about 750 additional workers and to create
about 50 carpet weaving workshops for 300 additional
artisans; and (ii) at the institutional level to
further strengthen BMDC as a financial intermediary
for industrial financing and to build up OTM's
capability to develop and support artisan carpet
weaving as well as to improve the accounting
standards of the corporate sector. In addition, the
project would assist the Government in carrying out
a review of the policies and institutional set-up
affecting the industrial sector. The main risk
arising from the organizational weakness of some
project institutions (e.g. OTN, CFPP), would be
minimized by technical assistance included in the
project and by regular IDA supervision.

MAURITANIA
INDUSTRIAL AND ARTISAN DEVELOPME'ttT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
1.01      The Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania has
requested IDA's assistance to finance a small enterprise and artisan
development project in continuation of the support provided by the
previous "Urban and Rural Development Project" (Credit 888-MAU, signed
in April 1979). The proposed IDA credit of US$5.25 million would
follow-up on the previous project by providing (i) a line of credit for
financing private small and medium enterprises through the Mauritanian
Bank for Development and Commerce ("Banque Mauritanienne pour le
Developpement et le Commerce" - BMDC); (ii) technical assistance to
further strengthen BNDC's institutional capabilities; and (iii)
assistance to the Mauritanian Carpet Bureau ("Office du Tapis
Mauritanien" - OTM) to train and equip additional artisan carpet
weavers. In addition, the project will finance a pilot accounting
training program to help meet a specific need felt by both the corporate
and public sectors in Mauritania. Finally, the project will assist the
Government in carrying out a study on the policies and the institutional
set-up affecting the industrial sector.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
A.   The Economy.
2.01      Mauritania's 1.6 million people inhabit an area of 1.2 million
square kilometers (more than twice the size of France), of which only
one quarter, in the Senegal River Basin, is suitable for crops or
grazing while the remainder is desert. About one-third of the
population lives in towns. Despite a relatively high GNP per capita
(US$460 in 1983), most key social indicators point to a low quality of
life. Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 45 years, infant
mortality at 132 per 1,000, and less than 20% of the population is
literate in either Arabic or French.
2.02      The Mauritanian economy has traditionally depended mainly on
agriculture and mining. The rate of growth, which had averaged 8% per
annum in the 1960s, fell sharply in the 1970s because of severe and
repeated droughts and reduced world demand for iron ore, compounded by
the costly Western Sahara war (1976 - 1979). Mauritania's withdrawal
from the Saharan conflict (mid 1979) and good weather which led to a
sharp rise in cereal crops and in numbers of livestock enabled GDP at
factor cost to grow in real terms at 3.9% per annum during the period
1979 - 1981 (Annex 2-1). In 1982, however, as a result of a protracted



-2-
and intense drought combined with a steady decline of iron ore exports
and prices, GDP declined in real terms by 3.7% and although it rose in
1983 by 5.4% is expected to stagnate in 1984. Mauritania, whose
external disbursed debt reached about 60% of GDP in 1983, is therefore
facing a difficult economic and financial situation marked by balance of
payments deficits and exceptional dependence on foreign aid.
2.03      Mauritania's long-term development strategy is therefore to
exploit its renewable sources of growth particularly irrigated
agriculture, fishing and livestock and to maximize employment
opportunities for its rapidly growing urban population through the
development of light industry and artisanal activities. The first IDA
project took an important step in this direction by helping to create
new small industrial enterprises and develop artisanal carpet weaving,
and the proposed second IDA project would build upon the results
achieved in these areas.
B.   The Industrial Sector
1.   Structure
2.04      The industrial sector (artisanal activities excluded), whose
share of the country's GDP in real terms was 20.8% in 1983, is dominated
by mining operacions. In 1983, the mainly government-owned National
Company for Mining Industries which produces iron ore employed 34% of
the industrial sector's labor force of about 18,000 and contributed to
50% of its output (Annex 2-1). The same year, the construction
industry, consisting of one government- owned company and 31 private
enterprises, mostly small, whose total fixed assets amounted to about UM
290 million, accounted for 27% of output and 54% of employment in the
industrial sector.
2.05      Manufacturing is still embryonic.  Although the sector
received 35% of investment in the industrial sector in 1983, its 30
enterprises accounted for only 12% of its labor force and for 23% of its
output. Of the 30 manufacturing enterprises in operation that year, two
- a sugar refinery and a steel mill - were government-owned. Six of the
28 private firms received financing under the first IDA line of credit
to BMDC (Cr. 888-MAU). The production of food and beverages, household
chemicals (insecticid-s, cosmetics, detergents) and construction
materials accounted for about 80% of total private investment and 83% of
the employment that it generated (Annex 2-2).
2. Performance
2.06      Mining output which has declined from 1980 to 1983 before
returning in 1984 to the 1980 level is not expected to increase
significantly in the next several years. The manufacturing sector is in
its infancy and handicapped by several factors, in particular, the



-3-
inadequacy of infrastructure and human skills. Available information
would indicate a low capacity utilization of below 50Z in 1983.
However, some improvement in these respects is in sight. In the
Nouakchott area a new port is pr2sently under construction; a new power
plant is expected to start operations in 1988 and the rehabilitation of
power and water utilities, to be financed under the IDA Public
Enterprises Rehabilitation Project, is expected to increase the water
supply by about 5OZ by 1987. Since the late 1970's, the government's
Training and Professional Improvement Center ("Centre de Formation et de
Perfectionnement Professionel" - CFPP) has been providing training to
public and private sector employees, especially in accounting
(paras 3.20 and 3.2l', but it does not have the means to address the
overall needs of the country and of the industrial sector in particular.
Furthermore, in the spec;fic area of accounting, the ILO assistance to
CFPP, financed by the IDA Second Education project (Cr. 1214-HAU), was
phased out in March 1983. In order to support Government's efforts to
improve the management of existing enterprises, the training of
accountants already employed In private and public enterprises will be
financed under the proposed project (para 3.26).
3.   Industrial Policy
2.07      The growth of industrial activities (mining excluded) on which
the Government largely relies to diversify the economy is constrained by
the limited resource base of the country and by the small domestic
market which is fragmented over a vast territory. However there is
potential for further development, in particular, for the pgvduction of
goods whose high transport costs favor the domestic producer (e.g.
building materials), or which provide inputs to, or process outputs, of
fishing and agriculture. In addition, the influx of refugees into the
towns has provided a source of labor which, with some encouragement and
training, could be used in light industry. The Government's policy for
the industrial sector, outlined in the 1981 - 1985 Fourth Development
Plan, therefore emphasizes the promotion of small- and medium-scale
industrial enterprises. Recognizing, however, the need to reform its
own enterprises first, the Government is confining its role to the
rehabilitation of public enterprises, leaving the development of light
industry to private initiative.
4. Policy Instruments and Promotional Institutions
2.08      Investment Code.  Although the 1979 version of the Investment
Code was improved on IDA's recommendations during the first project, it
is still biased in favor of large-scale investment. Only investments
over UM 10 million (or about US$125,000) are eligible for such benefits
as exemption from import duties and income tax and other advantages.
The Government has accordingly agreed to IDA's suggestion that the
UM '0 million minimum be abolished, a step that would reduce the bias
against small industrial investments and instead, encourage them. This
measure has been approved by the Council of Ministers and its enactment



- 4 -
by the Mil-2tary Council will be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed project.
2.09      Protection and Pricing.  Mauritania which belongs to the West
African Economic Community and to the Economic Community of West African
States, cannot, according to the rules of these institutions restrict
imports from fellow member countries. Neither does it officially limit
imports from other countries. However, besides a high tariff protection
which ranges between 56% and 104% for industrial products, the
Government has since 1982 discouraged imports which could threaten
existing industries by not granting relevant requests for import
licences. With respect to pricing, the Government administers a system
of controls which allows free marketing of a few luxury products, sets
specified margins over costs for other products, and sets the prices of
about 30 primary products.
2.10      The Government has agreed to IDA's view, shared also by a
UNIDO-financed studv of the industrial secto! completed in October 1984,
that excessive protection coupled with price control may further
increase price distortions and misallocation of resources besides
weakening the efficiency of existing enterprises. In order to help the
Government remedy this situation, the proposed project would finance
cechnical assistance to the Ministry of Industry which would carry out
an industrial sector review with a view to establishing an adequate
industrial data base, and identifying the necessary changes in the
incentives system (para 3.28).
2.11      Promotional Institutions.  Two institutions and two
commissions have responsibilities in connection with industrial
development. The Center for Studies and Industrial Promotion ("Centre
d'Etudes et de Promotion Industrielle"- CEPI), within the Ministry of
Industry, is intended to provide assistance to new entrepreneurs at all
stages of the project cycle, to carry out feasibility studies, appraise
new projects, and process applications for benefits under the Investment
Code. A private institution, the Confederation of Mauritanian Employers
("Confederation Generale des Employeurs" - CGEM) assists new private
investors. The aim of the National Commission for Industry chaired by
the Minister of Industry, is to improve the environment for industries
and thus to encourage industrial development. The National Investment
Commission ("Commission Nationale des Investissements" - CNI), chaired
by the Mininster of Plan, meets periodically to decide whether projects
presented by new investors, are eligible for benefits under the
Investment Code.
2.12      Although on IDA's recommendation the role of CEPI and of the
CNI has been redefined in order to shorten the review of projects
seeking the benefits of the Investment Code, this process is still
cumbersome. In addition, the promotional institutions have so far
achieved verv little in promoting industrial development because of the
scarcity of suitably qualified administrative and technical staff, and



-5-
more importantly, the lack of a clear definition of their roles that
would avoid duplication and make the best use of the available staff.
At the Government's request, the assistance noted in para 2.10 would
also help (i) design an adequate institutional set up for industrial
promotion, define the respective roles of CEPI, CGEM, CNI and of the two
development banks (para 2.18) and propose institutional cooperation
arrangements between them; (ii) formulate an action plan for the
reorganization of CEPI including a possible participation of private
entrepreneurs in CEPI's ownership and management and define its needs
for technical assistance and training; and (iii) standardize project
appraisal procedures for all institutions involved in industrial
promotion. Draft terms of reference of this technical assistance have
been agreed upon. The recommendations resulting from the technical
assistance studies would be reviewed by IDA with a view of making
appropriate suggestions.
C.   The Artisanal Sector
1.   Background
2.13      According to Government estimates about 49,000 artisans are
engaged in the production of ordinary consumer goods and art objects.
The number of male artisans has remained constant for many years. In
the meantime, increasing numbers of women have entered this field of
production, and there are now about 33,000 women art-sans. Although
artisans form between 8 and 10% of the working population, their
contribution is estimated to be only about 0.2% of GDP and about 2X of
industrial activity, other than mining (Annex 2-1).
2.   Government Policies and Institutions
2.14      In 1967, the Government took the first step towards expanding
the artisanal sector by creating "precooperatives". It envisaged to
supply them with raw materials and assist them in the organization and
in the marketing of their production, to enable them to become
independent cooperatives. Since then, all development plans have
included financial support for artisans. The fourth development plan
(1981 - 1985) earmarks about US$8 million for creating an artisan
village in each of the 12 Mauritanian administrative regions to help
artisans market their products.
2.15      Three institutions have been set up to administer this
government assistance. Within the Ministry of Industry, the Artisan
Promotion Department helps to staff the 33 "precooperatives" that it has
created since 1967. OTM, also under the Ministry of Industry, promotes
hand knotted carpet productiou with financial and technical assistance,
provided under the first IDA project, to improve the quality and
quantity of carpet production and to train weavers (paras 3.15 through
3.19). Within the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, the Department



-6-
of Social Affairs has created about 31 women's cooperatives engaged in
weaving, embroidery and dressmaking.
3.   Achievements and Prospects
2.16      The development of artisan activities in Mauritania is favored
by the pool of cheap refugee labor and by a long tradition of
handicrafts. Nevertheless, although the Government has repeatedly
stated its objective of developing this sector, artisans have received
very little help. To date, none of the "precooperatives" has become an
independent cooperative and only one of the 12 artisan villages
envisaged under the fourth development plan has been created in
Nouakchott. In any event these artisan villages no longer appear
warranted because of the low level of artisanal production. The
promotional institutions are inadequately staffed and have received very
little of the funds earmarked for them in the development plans. The
development of the sector requires financial resources and skilled
personnel beyond Mauritania's present capacity. With the exception of
the carpet weaving activity, the prospects for the expansion of the
sector appear therefore limited.
C.   The Financial Sector
1.   Institutional Setting
2.17      In mid-1973, Mauritania withdrew from the West African
Monetary Union ("Union Monetaire Ouest Africaine" - UMOA), created a
Central Bank ("Banque Centrale de Mauritanie" - BCM) and introduced a
new currency, the Ouguiya (UM). Besides BCK and the Government Post
Office System ("Compte Cheques Postaux") there are five co ercial
banks. All the banks are jointly owned by the Government and foreign
shareholders. In all of them the Government holds, either directly or
through the Central Bank, a majority interest except for the
Arab-Lybian Bank of Mauritania in which it owns only 49% of the share
capital.
2.18      Development Banking.  Of the five commercial banks, only BM1DC
(para 3.04 to 3.14) has an important development banking role. In this
field it works closely with the fully government-owned National
Development Fund ("Fonds National de Developpement" - FND,) established
in 1980 to finance projects in the agriculture and fishing sectors Which
received little help from commercial banks. However, FND became also
engaged in industrial financing. In order to avoid duplication in this
field, F1D and BMDC acting upon IDA's recommendation, concluded an
institutional cooperation agreement effective since .August 1984, by
which they will cofinance all industrial projects, with BMDC asssuming
the lead role for projects costing less than UM 60 million (or about
US$750,000), and FND for projects above this limit.



-7-
2.   Banking  Policies and Interest Rates
2.19      BC! is the Government's instrument for enforcing banking
policies. To this end, BCM (i) reviews all credit applications over
UK 2 million for local resources to be financed by the Nauritanian
banks; (ii) sets a ceiling each year on short- and medium-term
rediscountable facilities available to each individual bank; (iii)
regulates the terms and conditions of all bank credits to be financed by
local resources; and (iv) sets financial ratios that the banks must
observe. BCM's detailed regulations are described in Annex 2-3.
2.20      BCM does not rediscount credits whose terms exceed 8 years.
Lending rates to final borrowers range from 6% to 13% for rediscountable
credits and 10% to 15% for non-rediscountable credits, the lower rates
applying in both cases to agriculture and livestock. While interest
rates charged on nona rediscountable credit are quite adequate, those
charged on rediscountable credits (to the productive sectors) are low
compared to the international markets and to the annual inflation rate
expected to run at about 10% in the next five years. BCM's rediscount
rate is 4.5% for credits to agriculture and livestock and 6.5% for loans
to all other sectors. The spread allowed to the banks on rediscounted
credit is higher on short-term (1.5% to 3.5%) than on medium-term credit
(1% to 3%), which may constitute a disincentive for term lending.  BCM
also regulates interests paid to deposits. These range from 5 to 9%
according to their amount and term. The structure of interest rates is
such, however, that for the same amount term deposits are paid at most
0.5% more than short term (up to one year) deposits. As part of the
conditions  of the second IMF stand-by arrangement, expected to be
effective later in 1985, the Government has agreed to raise in March
1985 all interests rates by 2%. In addition, BCM will undertake a
review of the level and structure of interest rates to be completed by
June 1985.
3.   Issues
2.21      The banking system is unable to mobilize adequate local
resources to finance the growth of credit to the economy. Although
during the 1979-1983 period total deposits received by the banks grew at
about 20% per annum from UM 3.3 billion to about UM 7 billion, they
represented only 50% of total lending in 1983. Because of continued
restrictive credit policies aiming at reducing credit for imported
consumer goods and improving the country's balance of payments, the
share of BCM financing in total credit decreased from 21% in 1979 to 16%
in 1983. In the meantime, the banking system borrowed heavily abroad in
order to sustain the growth of its lending (Annex 2-4), thereby
aggravating the country's foreign reserve situation. Moreover, the
banking system lacks adequate term resources for development financing.
Although the interest rates charged on non rediscountable term credits
are not low in relation to foreign credits, the country's high
indebtedness discourages potential foreign term lenders. The structure
of interest paid to deposits does not encourage term deposits relative



-8-
to demand deposits. Still another problem - not uncommon in developing
countries - is that the Mauritanian banks have to contend with very high
portfolio arrears resulting from the economic slowdown which started in
1982 as well as from their own weak wanazement and iniadequate
experience.
2.22      In recognition of these shortcomings, the Government has
commissioned a review of the banking system by the French International
Center for Training in Banking ("Centre International de Formation a la
Formation Bancaire" - CIFPB) which would include (i) an audit of all the
banks; (ii) measures for increasing their operational efficiency and for
improving their financial condition; (iii) measures for increasing the
mobilization of local and especially term resources; and (iv) the
conditions of the establishment of a financial market within which, with
the exception of a prime rate determined by BCH, the commercial banks
would be free to determine their lending rates. The IMF is attempting
to accelerate this banking sector study in connection with its
forthcoming standby arrangement with the country. In coordination with
the IMF, IDA will review upon their completion BCM's study of interest
rates mentioned above as well as the study of the banking system with a
view to making appropriate policy inputs.
III. THE PROJECT
3.01      The proposed project, to be financed by an IDA credit of
US$5.25 million, would comprise five components (i) a line of credit to
BI4DC for financing economically and financially viable private small-
and medium-scale enterprises (US$3.8 million); (ii) technical assistance
to further strengthen BMDC's procedures, organization and staff training
(US$430,000); (iii) assistance to OTM to provide technical and marketing
guidance to carpet weavers trained under the first project in Nouakchott
and to train 300 additional carpet weavers (outside Nouakchott) and help
them start commercial production (US$460,000); (iv) assistance to CFPP
to train 25 accountants employed by private and public enterprises
(US$310,000); and (v) technical assistance to the Ministry of Industry
to carry out a study aimed at improving industrial sector policies and
promotional institutions (US$250,000). The project would build on the
results, described in the following paragraphs, of the previous project.
A. The Previous Project.
3.02      The first industrial and artisanal operation (under Credit
888-MAU, of US$8 million of 1979) which will be completed in
December 1985 consists of (i) a line of credit of US$2.55 million to
BMDC to finance small- and medium-scale industry; (ii) technical
assistance to BMDC (US$620,000); (iii) technical and financial
assistance to help OM train about 400 artisan carpet weavers, supply



-9-
them with looms and raw materials and establish extension services to
support their commercial activity (US$1.66 million); and (iv)
feasibility studies for an industrial estate in Nouakchott and the
artisanal manufacturing of bricks made of gypsum (US$70,000).
3.03      Except for the OTH component (paras 3.16 and 3.17), the first
industrial and artisanal operation was satisfactorily implemented. The
line of credit to BMDC (which was increased in September 1984 from
US$2.1 million to US$2.55 million) is fully committed and 95% disbursed
as of February 1985. It has financed 9 subprojects creating about 260
new jobs (summary data on these subprojects in Annex 3-1). The
technical assistance to BMDC helped build-up the appraisal capability of
its Development Department and improve its data processing. Under the
OTM component, it was originally envisaged that 400 carpet weavers
should have completed their training and started commercial production
by June 1985, but so far only slightly more than one half have done so.
The two feasibility studies were carried out satisfactorily. Although
the conclusions of the study concerning the establishment of an
industrial estate in Nouakchott were positive, the implementation of
such an estate should await the availability of adequate supply of water
and energy to this city, expected by 1987-1988. Following the study on
artisanal manufacturing gypsum bricks, the construction of buildings
using this material has started on an experimental basis. However, this
experiment has not yet confirmed the viability of the process.
B.  The Project Institutions
1.  The Mauritanian Bank for Development and Commerce - BMDC
3.04      Background.  BMDC, originally named Mauritanian Development
Bank ("Banque Mauritanienne de Developpement") was established in 1961
as a development bank by the Government of Mauritania and the French
Central Fund for Economic Cooperation ("Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique" - CCCE). In 1974 it was authorized to conduct the full
range of banking activities, was renamed the Mauritanian Bank for
Development and Commerce and received management assistance from the
Tunisian Banking Company ("Societe Tunisienne de Banque" - STB) which
bought the shares previously owned by CCCE. BMDC's share capital of UM
80 million is owned by the Government (76%), STB (20%) and BCM (42).
An analysis of BNDC's organization and policies is given in Annex 3-2.
3.05      Operations.  The financial statements provided in Annex 3-3
for the 1979 - 1983 period, show that the expansion of BMDC's operations
more than doubled its assets.  In addition, BMDC, which incurred losses
until 1979 has been profitable since 1980. BMDC's outstanding portfolio
increased from UM 1.12 billion to UK 1.97 billion at an average annual
rate of 15%. Short-term lending and term lending rose by about 18% and
10% respectively per year. Between 1980 and 1983 term lending to the
industrial sector grew steadily at an average rate of 26% per annum,



- 10 -
while credits for housing construction, public utilities and agriculture
decreased. Within this sector, as of September 1984, BMDC had financed
17 enterprises (including 9 under the first IDA Credit) and held equity
investments amounting to UK 23.5 million in two enterprises.
3.06      Portfolio Arrears. BMDC's arrears as of end 1982 and 1983 are
given below:
Evolution of BMDC's Arrears between 1982 and 1983
(in Ul[ million)
December 31, 1982        December 31, 1983

as % of outstanding
portfolio                 53                       35
As a result of the economic slowdown and BMDC's inadequate procedures, but
mainly because of the lack of a legal tribunal with specific jurisdiction
over delinquent debtors, the quality of BMDC's portfolio declined until
1982. By the end of that year, its arrears were very high, amounting to
UM 913 million or 53% of total outstanding portfolio. In 1983, BMDC took
advantage of new measures enacted by the government on IDA's
recommendation, including the creation of a special court to deal with
delinquent debtors; it referred to that court delinquent loans amounting
to UM353 million (or 39% of outstanding arrears). As of end 1983, BMDC
had reduced its arrears to EM 726 million or 35% of total outstanding
portfolio. Details on loans related to BMDC arrears and age of arrears as
of end 1983 are given in Annex (3-4).
3.07     BMDC pursued its recovery efforts and, as of September 1984, reduced
its arrears to US 637 million or 28% of total outstanding portfolio. BMDC
expects to further reduce arrears on short-term loan portfolio and its
overall arrears position will improve more significantly with expected



- 11 -
collections of six delinquent term loans to industrial enterprises (none
of which was financed by the first IDA credit). Two of these two loans were
made with a government guarantee, to the Mauritanian Company for Industry
and Equipment ("Mauritanienne des Industries et Equipements" - MIE), a
privately-owned blanket factory in which BMDC also holds an equity
investment, and to the Company for Apartment Building Construction and
Management ("Societe de Construction et Gestion Immobiliere" - SOCOGIK), a
government-owned company. Together these loans accounted in 1983 for
UM 151 million of BMDC's arrears (for which no provision was made), and
represented 20X of total arrears and of 63% arrears on the term loan portfolio.
3.08     Under the first IDA credit, the government had agreed to
compensate BNDC for any loss on government-guaranteed loans, in particular
those made to MIE and SOCOGIM, presently under reorganization, should
these enterprises be unable to repay BMDC. During negotiations a
reorganization plan and repayment schedule, both acceptable by IDA,
have been presented for MIE. It was agreed that (i) the submission of
a satisfactory reorganization plan and repayment schedule for SOCOGIM
would be a condition of effectiveness; and (ii) the government would
honor its guarantees if MIE or SOCOGIM were to respect their repayment
schedule.
3.09     BMDC's Capital Structure.  On the basis of BMDC's unaudited
balance sheets, as at end 1983, although its term debt/equity ratio was
still below the 4:1 limit set under the first IDA credit agreement, its
total debt/equity ratio (not covenanted under the firsc IDA project) had
reached 22:1. However, if the UM 98 million additional provisions for
bad loans recommended by its auditors to reflect more accurately BMDC's
portfolio risks were established, this would have reduced its net worth
from UK 118 million to UM 20 million, bringing its term and total debt/
equity ratios respectively to 5.8:1 and to 129:1, the latter being
excessively high by normal banking standards. In 1984, at IDA's urging,
BNDC's board of directors agreed to increase its share capital by
UK 200 million of which US 50 million would come from a cash subscription
by BCM to BMDC's share capital and about UM 150 million from the conversion,
(agreed on between IDA and the government in March 1984), of the first line
of credit (US$2.55 million) into government equity. The equivalent of
US$1.945 million (or about UM 120 million) disbursed by BMDC, as of end 1984,
has already been converted into equity and the conversion will be completed
by end 1985 following the full disbursement of this first line of credit.
In parallel, BM¶DC has agreed to include (i) in its 1984 balance sheet an
amount of UN 49 million of additional provisions; and (ii) in its 1985
balance sheet, the balance between this amount and the amount of additional
provisions that BMDC's auditors will recommend, following the audit of
its 1984 accounts.
3.10     The financial measures described above would, by end 1985, bring
BIMDC's net worth to UK 279 million and improve its term debt/equity ratio
to 1.4:1 and the total debt/equity ratio to 10.5:1, which would be quite



- 12 -
satisfactory by normal banking standards. I/ The term debt/equity limit
of 4:1, set under the previous project, would be maintained. In addition,
it is recommended that a limit of 12:1 be set on BMDC's total debt to
equity ratio. The establishment of additional provisions of UN 49 million
and the paying in by BCM of UM 50 million into BNDC's share capital increase,
will be conditions of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
3.11     BMDC's Organization and Staffing.  BMDC has competent management
and a nucleus of dedicated staff. With the technical assistance provided
under the previous project, BMDC has developed a good capability for term
lending, including adequate project appraisal and supervision. BMDC has
made noteworthy efforts to improve its operational procedures and its data
processing (in particular by introducing the use of computers), and to
strengthen its personnel. In order to achieve a higher level of
operational efficiency, BMDC intends to complete the codification of all
its operational procedures, as well as to review those already codified to
adapt them to the organizational changes which occurred in the past years
and to strengthen its management practice and staff training. Measures to
that effect ar- included in BMDC's Action Program analyzed in the following
paragraph.
3.12     BMDC's Action Program.  In consultation with IDA, BMDC has
formulated a comprehensive Action Program outlining specific measures for
correcting existing institutional shortcomings and for achieving further
improvements, both from a financial and an operational standpoint. This
Action Program contains specific and monitorable deadlines for key steps.
(Annex 3-5).
a)   From a financial standpoint, the share capital increase
and the establishment of additional provisions referred to in
para 3.09 should result in considerable improvements in BMDC's
capital structure, including a restructured balance sheet that
would more accurately reflect the condition of the portfolio.
In addition, BMDC will pursue the account-by-account review of
its loan portfolio in arrears, to be completed by June 1985 and
to be repeated at least annually thereafter, to serve as a basis
for its intensified loan collection efforts and as a part of
its objective of gradually reducing the ratio of arrears to
outstanding portfolio from 35% (actual as of end-1983) to 15%
by end-1987. In regard to future financial management, the
Action Program sets such quantitative targets as a current
ratio of no less than 0.75:1, a term debt/equity ratio of not more
1/   By way of comparison, banking regulations in the West African
Monetary Union allow the banks a ratio of net worth to risk assets of
6%, which would imply a total debt/equity ratio of 16.7:1.



- 13 -
than 4:1, a total debt/equity ratio of not more than 12:1, and
a gradual reduction of the ratio of administrative cost to
total assets from 3.6% in 1983 to below 3.0% by 1988;
b)   From an operational standpoint, the Action Program
provides for the establishment of an adequate Management
Information System, the codification of key operating
procedures and systematic staff training, the desirability of
which is discussed in para 3.11. The technical assistance to
be provided under the project (para 3.23) would help BMDC carry
out this program of institutional strengthening.
3.13     BMDC's Financial Projections and Resource Requirements.  BMDC's
financial projections for the period 1985 - 1989, with their underlying
assumptions, are given in Annex 3-6. BMDC's total assets are expected
conservatively to grow at a rate of 10% instead of the 19% of the recent
past.  Its operations are expected to remain profitable and its net profits
as a percentage of net worth to rise from 9% in 1985 to 15% in 1989. Term
debt and total debt to equity ratios would range from 1.4:1 to 1.7:1 and
from 10.0:1 to 10.4:1 respectively. Provisions, which are expected to
represent 10.7% of total outstanding portfolio in 1985, would be increased
to reach 13% in 1987 and would remain at this level thereafter.
3.14     With the experience gained during the first project BNDC has
built up a pipeline of about 36 subprojects (of which three are expansion
projects) whose total cost would be UM 2.8 billion (or US$34 million)
(Annex 3-7). BMDC intends to select from this pipeline about 20 small-
and medium-scale subprojects with the highest economic merits. During the
1985-1989 period, its disbursements on term loans are expected to amount
to UM 434 million. Rediscounted medium-term credit is expected to amount
to about UM 87 million. BMDC does not expect other external term
resources than the proposed IDA line of credit (equivalent to about UM 300
million). To fill its term resources gap, BlDC envisages using about
UM 47 million of its one-year renewable deposits, which have proved to be
stable in the past, and can therefore be used for term lending.
2.   The Mauritanian Carpet Bureau - OTH
3.15     Background.  In 1979, when carpet production and weavers' training,
provided by the Mauritanian Tourism and Artisanal Bureau were virtually
at a standstill, a component for rehabilitation of this handicraft was
included in the first IDA project. In 1980, on IDA's recommendation,
the newly created agency, OTM, decentralized carpet production by forming
small independent cooperatives of six weavers each, working from the house
of one of the weavers. In addition to technical guidance, OTM provided
each cooperative, as a credit in kind, with one loom and an initial raw
material supply. OTM was to recover the cost of the raw material by paying
only the labor cost of carpets delivered by the weavers. Each cooperative
was to repay the cost of its loom within eight years, with an 8.5% per
annum interest rate.



- 14 -
3.16     OTH's Operations.  By 1982 OTM had, with IDA's funds and the
help of the Tunisian Carpet Bureau, equipped 200 women weavers and started
to train another 200. However, because it had, in 1980, inherited from
its predecessor an onerous short term debt of about UM 25 million and
excess administrative staff, it was operating at a loss and with
insufficient working capital to finance the raw materials that it needed.
Consequently, notwithstanding the weavers' willingness to work, their
production, which rose from 760 m2 in 1980 to 1,500 m2 in 1981, dropped in
1982 to 1,000 m2. Furthermore, in 1983 the government stopped paying its
50% share of training costs, the banks discontinued the granting of
overdrafts to 0TM, which consequently stopped production and training, and
IDA suspended in March 1983 all disbursements on this component of the
project. OTM's balance sheet as of December 31, 1983 (Annex 3-8) showed a
negative net worth of UM 30.5 million and a short-term debt of about UM 40
million including UM 22 million towards the banks and UM 13.5 million
towards the social security system.
3.17     As a condition of the resumption of IDA's disbursements, the
government reduced OTIH's administrative personnel from 36 to 11, along
with other administrative measures for streamlining OTM and strengthening
its management. In addition, it has reduced OTM's debt towards the
social security system to UM 9.4 million (by cancellation of the interest
due) and agreed to bring about the conversion of this debt, as well as
oTM's debt towards the banks into long-term debts with maturities compatible
with OTM's debt servicing capacity. The government further agreed that
during the implementation period (i) no debt repayment would be requested
by any of OTM's creditors; and (ii) OTM's future revenues would be deposited
in a special account at BMDC to finance OTK's activities exclusively.
Consequently, IDA resumed in October 1984 the financing of the completion,
over a 6 months period, of the training interrupted in 1983 of 200 weavers,
of the supply of initial raw materials to start the production of carpets
and of technical assistance to 0TM.
3.18     Prospects.  0TM has a fully equipped training center capable of
receiving 200 trainees at any one time. By June 1985, there will be about
400 weavers, of which 200 already fully trained, capable of producing a
highly appreciated product for local as well as foreign markets, in which
potential European importers have shown interest. In addition, continued
assistance to 0TM would Ci) create considerable employment (taking into
account the fact that women once trained, can easily train other members
of their families) at a very low cost (about US$1,500 per person for
training and equipment); (ii) provide work in particular for the
impoverished women refugees in the cities; and (iii) increase, although
marginally, the country's foreign exchange earnings because a large
proportion of carpets produced would be exported or locally sold to
foreigners. OTM's projected income statements (Annex 3-9) show that,
following the above rehabilitation measures, it would be able to
generate positive cash flows (after debt repayment) growing from about
UM 820,000 in 1985 to about UM 7.3 million in 1989.



- 15 -
3.19     It is therefore recommended that the proposed project continue
to support OTM by financing the training of new weavers and the equipment
and initial raw material needed to establish new cooperatives. During
negotiations, it was agreed that OTH's debts towards the social security
system and towards the banks will, no later than October 31, 1985, be
converted into long-term loans with amortization periods of not less than
10and 8 years respectively, including grace periods of not less than 3
and 2 years respectively and with interest rates compatible with OTH's
ability to repay these loans. Draft loan agreements between OTM and its
auditors would be submitted to IDA no later than August 15, 1985. The
effectiveness of these loans will be a condition of disbursement for this
component. If by October 31, 1985 either of these loans are not effective,
the OTM component would be dropped from the project and the funds earmarked
for this purpose would be allocated to the line of credit to BMDC.
3.   The Training and Professional Improvement Center - CFPP
3.20      Background.  CFPP is a state-owned vocational training center,
founded in the late 1970s with UNDP and IDA financing (under the first
Education Project), located in Nouakchott. Its object is to organize
in-service training for both public and private sector employees, in
bookkeeping, clerical services and selected technical fields (e.g.
construction activities, automobile mechanics). The private sector
participates, through CGEM, in the financing of CFPP's operation.
CFPP has financial autonomy under the Ministry of Labor and operates
efficiently. Its organization and operations are detailed in document
no. B.3 in the project file .
3.21      CFPP's Role in the Training of Accountants.  The Accounting
and Auditing Profile of Hauritania, prepared by the World Bank in 1982,
drew attention to the lack of qualified accountants. In addition to an
already considerable need for basic training in accounting, training is
required for all existing professionals to help them adapt to the new
Mauritanian Accounting Code that the Government introduced in 1982.
CFPP, the only institution which provides training for accountants of
industrial enterprises, has therefore a major role to play in enhancing
accounting practice in these enterprises but it lacks the financial and
technical means to carry out this task. As mentioned earlier (para
2.06), the proposed project would include assistance to CFPP to train
about 25 accountants. A PPF of US$140,000 was approved in September
1984 to finance the preparation of this training component.
C.   Project Description and Objectives
3.22      Line of Credit to BMDC.  The Government would relend US$3.8
million of the IDA Credit to BMDC for onlending on the following terms
and conditions (i) Beneficiaries: BMDC would finance fixed investment
and permanent working capital needs among the new or existing private
enterprises included in its pipeline (para 3.14 and Annex 3-7), in



- 16 -
sectors other than agriculture, including inter alia agro-industry and
fisheries. With the objective of reaching a relatively large number of
smaller enterprises, an amount of US$1 million is earmarked for
financing enterprises whose total assets do not exceed US$250,000; (ii)
Relending Terms to BMDC: The line of credit would be relent by the
Government to BMDC for 20 years (including five years of grace) at an
interest rate of 7% p.a., which, considering the final onlending rate of
11% referred to in (iii) below, would give BMDC an adequate spread of 4
percentage points. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by the
Government against a 1% per annum fee charged to final borrowers. The
standard IDA commitment fee of 0.5% would apply to BMDC. BMDC will
re-use the second generation funds to finance activities or projects
that are in line with the original objectives of the line of credit,
including the financing of enterprises' permanent working capital; (iii)
Terms and Conditions to Final Borrowers: Subloans by BMDC would have
maturities of up to 12 years, including a grace period of one to three
years. BNDC's subloans would finance up to 85% of the subprojects whose
cost is below the free limit and up to 75% of those whose cost is above
the free limit.   BMDC's onlending rate to final borrowers would be 11%
(plus a 1% per annum fee accruing to the Government as a guarantee fee
for covering the foreign exchange risk); (iv) Subproject Processing:
There would be an individual free limit of US$150,000, with an aggregate
limit of US$1 million. It is estimated that with this limit, about 12
subprojects out of 20 will require IDA's review for approval. All
subproject appraisal reports by BMDC would have to show appropriate
economic justification, including an analysis of capital intensity and
choice of technology, value added and foreign exchange savings or
earnings. Whenever applicable, subproject appraisal reports would
include the calculation of the financial rate of return and of the
economic rate of return. The latter should be not less than 12%.
2.   Technical Assistance to BMDC
3.23      This component would help further develop BMDC's institutional
strength in particular through the implementation of the Action Program
referred to in para 3.12. To this end, US$430,000 would be passed on as
a grant by the Government to BMDC to finance (i) one year of expatriate
expertise to help BMDC codify its procedures and establish a MIS
(US$80,000); (ii) the extension for three years of the services of an
existing technical adviser (provided by STB) who will help put into
practice BMDC's new procedures, MIS and internal controls, and the
training of its personnel (US$210,000); (iii) six months of short-term
consultancy services to BMDC's Development Department to help assess the
appropriateness of equipment and price of subprojects submitted to BMDC
(US$70,000); and (iv) training fees for 48 staff to attend courses at
the International Center for Training in Banking, a facility located at
BCM, created and efficiently operated with the assistance of the French
CIFPB, and the foreign costs of the training of 8 high level staff in
overseas courses and seminars (US$70,000).

3.   Technical and Financial Assistance to OTH
3.24      This component would help OTH (i) train about 300 additional
weavers in cities outside Nouakchott (100 in Ayoun, 50 in Barena, 50 in
Alleg and 100 in Kiffa); (ii) organize the trained weavers into 50
cooperatives to which OTh would provide equipment and initial raw
materials; and (iii) provide further technical and marketing assistance
to weavers. The latter would be trained in successive cities over a
three year period, in sessions of six months each. The provision of the
looms and raw materials would be treated as a credit in kind by OM, to
be repaid by weavers on the terms specified in para 3.15.
3.25      For this purpose the Government would pass on US$460,000 as a
grant to OTM to finance (i) the weavers' training costs, including
scholarships, raw materials (used as teaching materials) and
administrative costs (US$180,000); (ii) the provision of 50 looms,
vehicles and initial supplies of raw materials for the trained weavers
(US$210,000); and (iii) the extension for one year of the services of an
existing advisor provided by the Tunisian Carpet Bureau to complete the
strengthening of OTM's management and organization and the establishment
within the institution of a marketing department initiated under the
first project (US$70,000).
4.   The Training of Accountants
3.26      This component would finance a pilot scheme intended to train,
over a two-year period, an accountant for each of 25 selected
enterprises (16 privately-owned enterprises who are borrowers of BMDC
and 9 state-owned enterprises) who would become capable of applying
internationally accepted accounting standards. This training will be
provided within the CFPP by an ILO and two Mauritanian instructors. It
would consist both of formal courses at CFPP and of practical on-the-job
training at the enterprise level.
3.27      The Government would pass on for this component, an amount of
US$310,000 as a grant to CFPP to finance (i) a US$240,000 contract
signed with ILO to provide two years of services of an instructor
(US$225,000) and teaching materials (US$15,000); (ii) the salaries of
two local instructors (US$42,000); and (iii) an independent evaluation
of results (US$28,000).
5.   Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Industry
3.28      This component of US$250,000 would finance (i) two man/years
of expert services (US$200,000)to help the Ministry of Industry
establish an adequate data base and carry out a review of the incentives
system and of the institutional set up for industrial promotion
mentioned in paras 2.10 and 2.12 and implement the necessary reforms to
improve them; and (iii) equipment and vehicles (US$50,000).

D.   Project Costs and Financing
3.29      The total project cost net of taxes and duties would amount to
US$11.2 million, of which US$8.8 million or 78% would be in foreign
exchange. The financing of subprojects would amount to US$9.5 million
or 85% of total project cost. IDA financing would cover 47% of the
project cost, with the balance to be met by subproject sponsors (21% or
about the same percentage contributed during the first operation), the
project institutions (2%) and FND which received in 1984 a line of
credit of about US$6 million from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development (30%). IDA financing would cover 57% of total project
foreign costs and 12% of local costs. It would in particular finance
all the local costs of CFPP's and OTM's training with the understanding
that these two institutions will, upon completion of the project,
continue the training at their own expenses. The table in Annex 3-10
gives details of project costs and of the financing plan.
E.   Project Implementation
3.30      Monitoring and Evaluation.  The Project Implementation
Schedule is shown in Annex 3-11. The project would be monitored through
half yearly progress reports by BMDC, oTH and CFPP, on their respective
IDA-financed activities, and their content would be agreed on during
negotiations. BMDC and OTM would submit annual audited accounts,
including for BMDC a detailed analysis of arrears no later than nine
months following the end of the accounting period. CFPP would submit,
no later than 12 months after the end of the accountants' training, an
evaluation of the results by an independent institution or consultant.
In addition, each institution would prepare, within three months of
project completion, a Project Completion Report, the form and content of
which would be agreed with IDA.
3.31      Procurement.  In line with the Bank's standard practice with
DFC-type projects, and given the exnected small size of the procurement
contracts, there will be no international competitive bidding. For
imported machinery and equipment, OM and subproject sponsors would be
required to sollicit at least three quotations. For off-the-shelf
materials and civil works, BMDC would satisfy itself that purchases are
suitable and competitively priced. Consultants would be selected in
accordance with IDA guidelines and their terms of reference and
conditions of contract subject to prior approval by IDA.
3.32      Disbursements.  A US$500,000 revolving fund amounting to about
4 months of projected disbursements (Annex 3-12) would be established in
the form of a Special Account in US dollars at BCM. It will prefinance
expenditures by the three project institutions (BHDC, OTH, CFPP) and
those relating to subprojects approved by IDA. Disbursements would be
fully documented for technical assistance contracts, raw materials and
equipment. Initially, full documentation would be required for



- 19 -
subprojects; however, the Association would within 6 months following
project effectiveness review BMDC's performance with the possibility of
allowing disbursements against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). The
latter will be used for expenditures relating to training and salaries
of CFPP's local instructors. Disbursements under SOE procedure would be
supported by full documentation retained by the project institutions and
made available for IDA inspection during supervision. The SOEs and the
Special Account would be audited by auditors acceptable to IDA.
Disbursement would be for 100Z of IDA's participation towards the cost
of each subproject and 100Z of local training fees of BMDC's staff, of
OTX's training costs, of the salaries of local instructors to be
recruited by CFPP and of the technical assistance to the Ministry of
Industry. Reimbursement requests for less than US$20,000 equivalent
would not be submitted.
F.  Benefits and Risks
3.33      The project would build upon the results of the previous
operation and continue IDA support of the Government's objectives in the
SHE and artisanal sector. At the enterprise level, the project is
expected to finance through BMDC about 20 small- or medium-size
subprojects generating about 750 new jobs at an average cost of about
US$14,000 and to provide, through OTM, professional training as well as
equipment and initial raw materials to 300 additional artisan carpet
weavers. At the institutional level, the project includes technical
assistance for further strengthening the operational capabilities of
BMDC as a development lending institution, of OTM and of 25 enterprises
through the training of their accountants. At the sector level, the
project would reinforce IDA's policy dialogue with the Government
through discussions to take place following the completion of the
Industrial sector review (para 2.10) and the Central Bank review of the
banking sector (para 2.22).  Finally, at the country level, the project
would transfer sorely needed foreign exchange resources from IDA to one
of the neediest countries    tb S ,Sf-ahararz AXxica, for use in economically
productive investments.
3.34      A major risk which the project entails is the relative
weakness of the institutions involved in project implementation,
although stch risk is more pronounced for OTM, than it is for BMDC, the
principal project institution, which has made steady progress under the
first project. Another risk would be that, on account of both the
inadequate policy framework and the relative shortage of investment
projects prevailing in the country, sub-optimal subprojects might be
envisaged by BMDC for financing. The project seeks to minimize these
risks through IDA's subproject review process, through technical
assistance included in the project to strengthen the project
institutions and through close supervision.

ANNEX 2-3
Page 1 of 2
MADRITANIA
INDUSTRIAL AND ARTISAN DEVELOPMENT -PROJECT
CENTRAL BANK REGULATIONS
ON
RESIDCOUNTABLE CREDIT AND INTEREST RATES
1.       Rediscountable Short-term Credit. The maximum amount of
short-term credits that a bank can rediscount in a given year is defined
as the difference between the amount of projected short-term financing
agreed on with BCM and the Bank's permanent resources and short-term
deposits.  BC[ however provides further support above the approved
ceiling through temporary advances (pensions) to the banks to finance
government monopolies for Imports of essential goods and,in exceptional
circumstances, far unforeseen short-term credit demand. In the first
case, normal rediscount terms and conditions apply to the credit. In
the second case the temporary advance does not exceed 30 days and
interest is charged at 4.5% p.a. above the normal rate.
2.        Rediscountable Term Credit.  BCH does not rediscount for terms
exceeding 8 years. For BNDC which is considered as a development bank,
the medium-term rediscount ceiling is defined by BCM as 1502 of the sum
of BMDC's net equity (equity minus fixed assets, equity investments and
losses) and its long- and medium-term resources (minus non
rediscountable term loans).   For a purely commercial bank, the
rediscount ceiling is defined as the sum of the bank's net equity (as
defined above) its term resources (minus non rediscountable term loans)
and 25% of its demand and short-term deposits. Medium-term credits
guaranteed by the government are not included in the ceiling, although
they are rediscounted by BCH at normal rediscount terms and conditions.
3.        Interest Rates on Credits.  BCM's rediscount rate is 4.5% on
credit to agriculture and livestock and 6% on credit to all other
sectors.  BCM regulates interest rates charged by banks on short- and
medium-term credits whether they are rediscountable or not, as shown
below -

ANNEX 3-2
Page 1 of 4
MAURITANIA
INDUSTRIAL AND ARTISAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
BANQUE MAURITANIENNE DE DEVELOPPEMENT ET DE COMMERCE
Organization and Policies
1.         Management.  BNDC's Board of Directors consists of 10
members, appointed by the Government (8), STB (1) and BCM (1). The
Board appoints the General Nanager (who cannot be one of its members) to
whom it delegates the power to authorize credits under UM 20 million.
2.         Organization.  Besides a special unit (the General Inspection
Unit) under an expatriate whose role is also to advise the General
Manager, BMDC's organization (see chart, page 4 of this annex) includes:
- four departments: Commercial Banking, Financial,
Development and Administration and,
- three divisions: Credit, Collection and Legal.
All these units report directly to the General Manager. The Commercial
Banking Department is the most important unit in terms of its
activities. It supervises all banking operations conducted by BMDC's
four branches. The Financial Department comprises a finance and
accounting and a data processing division. B3DC envisages (Action
Program - Annex 3-5) to develop its general inspection unit to enable it
to carry out systematic and regular internal controls of its operations.
Within the Development Department a unit will also be created to carry
out regular supervision of its client enterprises, presently performed
as described further in paragraph 9.
3.         Staffing and Training.  Out of a total staff of 150, 24 are
professionals of whom 13 have a university or equivalent education. In
1983, BMDC sent 24 staff members, including three professionals, to a
Central Bank training center, the International Training Center for Bank
Personnel (Centre International de Formation de la Profession Bancaire -
(CIFPB), in Nouakchott and a further fonr professionals to seminars
organized by a West African institution, the Interafrican Training
Company (Societe Interafricaine de Formation - SIFOR).
4.         Investment Policy.  BMDC's policy statement limits its equity
investment in any single company to 25% of the BMDC's net worth, or 35%
of the company's share capital, whichever is smaller.  BIDC's total
exposure (equity plus loans) in a single project is limited to 30% of
its net worth, or 90% of project cost, whichever is smaller.

ANNEX 3-2
Page 2 of 4
5.         Foreign Exchange Risk.  BMDC does not assume the foreign
exchange risk which is borne entirely by its borrowers. However, the
Government bore the foreign exchange risk on the first IDA line of
credit in return for a 1% per annum fee charged to the final borrowers.
6.         Credit Allocation.  The Credit division screens all credit
applications presented by individual clients, while the Development
Department reviews credit demands presented by corporate clients before
submitting its proposals to a "comite de lecture" chaired by the General
Manager. Two committees, the Credit and the Management Committees, also
chaired by the General Manager, review credit applications lower than
UM 2 million (or about US$ 25,000) for the former and those between UM 2
million and UM 20 million (or about US$ 250,000) for the latter. Credit
applications over UM 20 million are submitted to BMDC's board of
directors.
7.         Appraisals.  Appraisals of subprojects for term financing are
carried out by the Development Department which received a three
man/year technical assistance under the first IDA project. In making
such appraisals, the Department follows satisfactorily written
guidelines, prepared with the IDA-financed assistance despite
difficulties in gathering the appropriate data, but it lacks the
capability to appraise the technical aspects of complex projects. The
proposed project would finance six months of short-term consultancy
(para 3.23) to strengthen this area of subproject appraisal.
8.         Procurement.  The guidelines do not call for systematic
competitive bidding and BMDC does not have the capability to assess the
adequacy of suppliers' tenders so that some projects may have cost more
than necessary. This aspect of BMDC's operation would also be
strengthened by the external assistance mentioned in the above
paragraph.
9.         Supervision.  BMDC has codified procedures for  supervision.
Since the first IDA project these procedures have, inter alia, required
borrowers to submit periodical accounts. This requirement has imposed a
necessary but exacting discipline on Mauritanian enterprises, most of
which did not previously keep proper accounts. The improvement which
has resulted cannot be sustained, however, unless more local accountants
are trained. In addition to reviewing the financial statements of its
client enterprises, BMDC's staff visit them every three months to
ascertain the status of their operations and eventually make suggestions
to improve their functioning.
10.        Data Processing.  In connection with the first IDA project,
BMDC undertook to have its accounts examined annually by SOFIREC, a
foreign auditing firm. The audits have been helpful in ascertaining
BMDC's financial situation and its portfolio condition, for instance in
1983 when the auditors recommended that additional provisions of UM 98
million be established. BMDC's accounting system, although adequate,



- 30 -
ANNEX 3-2
Page 3 of 4
has been hampered by the inability of its data processing capability to
keep pace with the growth of its operations. Under the first project
IDA therefore financed the installation of a computer and assistance in
operating it. This system was fully operational by the end of 1984 and
is expected to handle client accounts, short term and term portfolios,
foreign exchange operations and BMDC's accounting..
11.        BMDC's Commercial Lending Operations.  Over the past five
years, BMDC's commercial operations have considerably grown (para. 3.05
of the main text) as a combined result of its increasing operational
capacity and of the opening of a new branch in Nouadhibou, the second
largest city in the countrv from where most fishing activities take
place.  As of end 1983, BMDC handled 250 accounts with deposits over UM
100,000 (or about US$1,250j while overdraft facilities had been extended
to about 630 clients.
12.        BMDC's Development Lending Operations.  As of end 1983, BSC
had granted term credits mostly to 120 clients for financing individual
housing construction and to 17 industrial enterprises received term
credits, among which 9 were financed by IDA's first line of credit.
During the 1979-1983  period, BMDC's outstanding net term loan portfolio
(equity investment excluded) rose from UM 380 million to UK 550 million
at an average rate of 10% per annum. As shown in the following table,
the share of the industrial sector in BMDC's net term lending grew
steadiLy on average by 26% per annum while credits to housing
construction, public utilities, and agriculture decreastd.

In addition to term lending, B!¶DC has equity participations amounting to
about UN 24 million in two enterprises which also received governrment-
guaranteed credit.

INDUSTRIAL AND ARTISAN DEVELOPM    PROJECT
ACTION PROGRAM FOR THE 1985 - 1989 PERIOD
During the period 1985 -1989, BMDC will endeavor to further
strengthen both its financial position and its operational capability in
the specific areas below:
I.   Financial Strengthening
A.   Capital Structure
BMDC will pursue the strengthening of its capital structure
through:
(a) in 1985
(i)     the incorporation in its 1984 balance sheet along with
the provisions for this year of an amount ofadditional
provisions of UM 49 million;
(ii)     the cash subscription of an amount of UM 50 million by
the Central Bank into BMDC's share capital increase;
(b) in 1986
(i)     the incorporation  in its 1985 balance sheet of an
additional provision amounting to the balance between
the amount that auditors will recommend following the
audit of its 1984 accounts and the UN 49 million
provision incorporated in its 1984 balance sheet;
(ii)     the further conversion into equity of an additional
amount representing the balance of the first IDA
line of credit which is expected to be disbursed in 1985;
The purpose of the above-mentioned financial measures, to be
completed by June, 1985 for items (a) and by June 30, 1986 for items (b)
will be to achieve a total debt/equity ratio of not more than 12:1.
B.     Arrears Reduction
BMDC will carry out a comprehensive review of all of its long- and
medium-term loans in arrears (126), and of a number of its short-
term loans and overdrafts in arrears (about 630) representing at



- 36 -
ANNE 3-5
Page 2 of 3
least 75% of their amount, with a view to classifying these loans and
overdrafts into the three following c'ategories. Category A: loans to be
rescheduled; category B: loans to be collected; category C: loans to be
written-off while BMDC will continue its recovery efforts. This review
will be completed by June 30, 1985, and-the actions to derive from the
review will be taken as promptly as possible. This portfolio review
will be updated at least once a year (a) to serve as a basis for BMDC's
continuing recovery efforts, and Cb) to assess the amount of additional
portfolio provisions to be constituted.
C. Guidelines for Financial and Portfolio Management
In conducting its financial affairs and managing its portfolio
for the future, BMDC will endeavor to observe the--following guidelines
and ratios:
Mi)     a current ratio above 0.75:1;
(ii)    as indicated in section A, a ratio of total debt to
equity within 12:1;
(iii)   a ratio of term debt to equity within 4:1
(representilg the limit set under the first IDA credit
agreement);
(1v)    BMDC will endeavor to gradually  reduce the ratio of
administrative costs to average of total assets from
3.6.% in 1983 to 3.0% by 1988.
tV)     BMDC will endeavor to gradually reduce the ratio of
arrears as a percentage of the outstanding portfolio
form 37Z (as of end-1983) to 25% by end-1985, 20% by
end 1986 and 15Z by end-1987.
II.    Strengthening of Operational Capability
A.     Management Information System
With the assistance from the expert to be financed under the
second IDA project, BMDC will review its requirements of management
information and data and establish an effecti±ve MIS, with the objective
of strengthening internal control and coordination. This will be
completed by end 1985.
B.   Review and Codification of Procedures
Ci)     BMDC will review and revise as necessary the
procedures which have already been codified, so as to
improve their effectiveness and to adapt them to
BMDC's evolving activities. This will be completed by
April 1986.

(ft) Additionally, BKDC vill formulate written procedures for
the folloving departments (for which such procedures
are not yet codified): financial, credit, international
banking operations, loan collection, personnel and
administrative management, and legal.
(iii)drawing on the existing personnel B1KDC will establish by
end 1985 an inspection unit to carry out regular
internal controls.
C.   Staff Training
BMDC will start implementing in 1985 its 3-year staff training
program (reviewed and agreed by IDA) which calls for the training of 56
employees including 8 high level staff. A staff training unit will be
set up in 1985 drawing to the extent possible on existing personnel to
supervise the training program.

6. Commercial Credit
It is assumed that short-term loans and overdrafts will increase at 15%
per year (as compared to the 18% p.a. growth achieved during the period
1979-1983). Projections have been made on the basis of the 1983 figures
for short-term loans and overdrafts (provisions included).
Short-term loans           2,004    2,315    2,670    3,078    3,545

7.   Provisions
Provisions which amounted to UM 109 million as of end 1983 will stand at
UM 158 million at the end of 1984 after inclusion of the additional UM 49
milliou (para 3.09). Provisions will increase to represent 10.8% of gross
outstanding portfolio in 1985 and 13% by 1987 and thereafter, level which
will be acceptable if arrears as a percentage of portfolio are reduced as
envisaged (Annex 3-5 para c (v)) to 15% by end 1987.

equity investments)       652       736      819      906    1,003
8.   Resources
Demand deposits are expected to grow by 15Z a year (as
compared to the 30% p.a. increase over the past five years).
One year renewable deposits are expected to grow at 7.5% per
annum. These assumptions applied to the 1983 figures result
in an increase of total deposit of 13% p.a. on average.
No further borrowings from CCCE are expected and the existing
term loan to finance housing construction wlli gradually phase
out over the period.
Borrowings from BCM are expected to cover each year about 13%
of short-term credit and a share of term credit decreasing
from 53% in 1985 to 38% in 1989.
-    Disbursements from IDA are expected to start in the second
half of 1985.
9.   Revenues
BMDC expects to charge a 12% p.a. interest on outstanding IDA-financed
term loans and 8% on average on all other term loans. Interests and
commisssion are expected to grow at 15Z per annum proportionately vith
the growth of the commercial portfolio mentioned above in para 6.
10. Financial Charges
The cost of BlDC's borrowing has been calculated at 6% p.a. for
borrowings from BCM, 3% p.a. for borrowings from CCCE and 8% p.a. for
borrowings from IDA. Although deposits are expected to grow by 13% p.a.
on average (para 8 above) it has been assumed that the financial charges
on deposits will grow bv 15% p.a. to reflect the higher cost of one year
renewable deposits.

These expenses are expected to grow by 52 p.a. to reflect increased
staff and training expenses.
12.  BLDC's Recapitalization
BNDC'. share capital will be increased in 1984 and 1985 by UK 120
million and UM 80 million respectively.

PROJECTED INCOME STATEMENTS
1.   Barkground
Although there are 200 skilled carpet weavers, capable of
producing each 1.5 m2/month of carpet or more if raw materials were
available, production has ceased since the end of 1983, because of OTM's
administrative and financial problems. After the adoption of measures
whose objective is to rehabilitate OTM (para 3.19) production and
training are expected to resume in January 1985 (after procurement of
the raw material financed by IDA in October 1984). The training of 200
additional weavers to be completed by June 1985.
2.   Assumptions
1.   The 200 existing weavers would start production in January
1985. Their number will increase by 200 by July 1985, 150 in
1986 and 150 in 1987.
2.   The 200 existing weavers will produce each 1.5m2/month of
carpet. The additional weavers will produce each I m2/month
during the six months following the completion of their
training and 1.5m2lmonth thereafter.
3.   The production of one month is sold the following month.
4.   For a given month, 702 of the sales would be paid to OTM
during this month and 30% the following month.
5.   3,000 m2 for the first year and 4,000 m2 per year thereafter
would be sold on the local market at UM 6,000/m2. The
production in excess of these amounts would be exported
at UM 5,0001m2.
6.   IDA would _inance 3 months of initial raw materials to help
new trained weavers start commercial production.
7.  The UM 9.4 million OTM's debt toward the social security
system would be amortized in 10 years including 3 years of
grace period at no interest (as indicated by the government
during negotiations). The UM 22 million debt towards the
banks Is converted into an 8 vear loan including 2 years of
grace at an interest rate of 8.5% (present prevailing
conditions on rediscounted credit to industrial and artisanal
enterprises).
